"lnvicta","8","530","883","2 June 2015"," It Follows breathes new life into a dying genre
","This is probably the best horror movie I've seen in the past decade. It Follows is a throwback to classic late '70s - '80s horror films and draws many comparisons to John Carpenter's style, from the music to the cinematography, and rather than appearing like a carbon copy or rehash of Halloween, director David Robert Mitchell executes this odd premise with such flair and finesse that you can't help but be refreshed by its cleverness. Everything about it works, from the brooding pace to the relatable characters, effortlessly sucking you into this gloomy world where STDs can pass on entities that follow you around no matter where you are. This is where most of the suspense comes from, because instead of relying on blood and shock value, It Follows is subtle and thought provoking - you never know where this thing is and it moves so slowly that you don't know when it will appear, and this uncertainty in waiting is what real suspense is all about. <br/><br/>One aspect that stands out, apart from the brilliant writing and directing, is the musical score by Disasterpeace. It's absolutely gorgeous in the most ominous, haunting way you can imagine. It's retro but not dated - heavy on synths and low on bombast, it sets the eerie tone of the movie right from the get-go and elevates the film's effectiveness into the stratosphere. Even as a standalone listen the music is brilliant, but when juxtaposed with the bleak imagery and unnerving atmosphere, it's downright masterful.<br/><br/>It Follows is not an overtly scary movie. It's a slowburner, and the emphasis on mood over jump scares makes it all the more terrifying. The acting is spot-on, the cinematography is glorious, the pacing is perfect - it's a breath of fresh air into the horror genre that has been on life-support for a while now. I can go on and on, but the thing to remember is that It Follows is not for everyone. If you're expecting this to be a paranormal slasher or something of the sort then you probably won't enjoy it. It's purely psychological, and these days, psychological horror is making a huge comeback. Last year we had The Babadook and this year the movie to beat is It Follows. Both movies are by new directors - Jennifer Kent and David Robert Mitchell respectively - which means they have their entire career ahead of them to rejuvenate the genre to the heights it used to reach. It Follows is a masterpiece in every respect and an absolute must-watch for horror fans that thought the genre was completely drained of originality. I can only imagine where horror will progress from here."

","Finally a real horror in a long time! No more bloody, slasher crap. This is how the really scary movies were made. Suspense and fear are created by great cinematography and music.<br/><br/>The pace of the movie is slow and almost no to few special effects are present. I surely hope that this movie hails the return of the great horror genre: we are scared of the unknown and not violence for the sake of it.<br/><br/>All the young actors are promising, they really pulled it off. Kudos to the director who also wrote the script, I am looking forward to his next movie.<br/><br/>Go see it, you won't regret it!"
"SushiStoner103","8","415","767","19 April 2015"," A Modern Horror Classic
","Inspired by 70's and 80's horror, it follows is a refreshing psychological horror film with a simple premise and a chilling concept. The cinematography is electrifying, every shot is beautiful and the score holds brilliance, it carries a very obvious John Carpenter vibe to it. The tension is raw, avoiding cheap jump scares and relies on music. Its eerie atmosphere is extremely effective keeping you inches above your seat for the majority of the runtime. The characters are interesting, providing depth and emotional attachment, most modern horror films seem to forget the importance of character development, its nice to see the genre hasn't completely lost it yet. There are several jumps scares, but they work, as they are not carried with unnecessary piecing music jolts but with the use of disturbing and sudden imagery.<br/><br/>The only errors I could detect were the unconventional editing style, the transitions were a little dodgy lacking fluency, this left the film to appear choppy at times but this flaw can be easily forgiven. Its outstanding cinematography and soundtrack make up for this. The film leaves a daunting stain of disturbing after effects that follow you for a long while, with a constant reminder to always check behind your back. An exceptional low budget indie horror film, strongly recommend."

","First of all, I can't believe people are giving this 10/10.. this proves some people do not know what a good movies is. COME ON! Plot, I will summarize the damn movie, a creature is following a girl who had sex with a guy. Girl tries to get rid of it, she fails. THE END There is no explanation to what ""It"" is. Why would she break a girl's leg and kills her, while killing another guy through humping his soul out. What is It after. Why would the victim team up to watch their own backs, since the death of one would mean the hunt for the other begin. So many question marks everywhere, so many illogical things happening. If I were followed by It i would at least look around or choose to travel in an airplane every few weeks. There is no Coherence in this movie. The ending was just horrible.<br/><br/>to top all of that, some reviews say its the horror movie of the decade. Really?? Does that mean you didn't watch any other horror movie in this decade?"
"groomeschase12","8","329","616","23 April 2015"," It Follows (2014)
","It Follows is a horror film made for horror fans, and it's about time one of those came around again.<br/><br/>This is a movie that was light on the jump scares, which is a delightful change of pace. In the past few years more and more horrors have relied on jump scares to make up for the true scariest part of any horror film, the sense of dread. Dread is felt in this movie almost immediately because it combines so well with the tone, another forgotten about ingredient in horrors.<br/><br/>There is no real way to explain the plot of this film without it coming across like a more twisted game of ""tag,"" which played a part in exactly how many people I could talk into seeing it after the mixed feelings from the trailer. That being said, the film breaks a lot of the norms set by today's ""scary"" films. This is a movie that knows what it's doing, and its main concern is to make the audience feel as if they are a part of the experience with the sense of realism. With the enemy being as far-fetched as it may come across in conversation, it's easy to get caught up in the surroundings of the characters looking for ""it."" Having to watch over the characters' shoulders throughout the movie makes it all the more frightening when something IS seen, and there's never a sense of safety.<br/><br/>It Follows takes a good deal from the greats in the horror genre, namely Halloween. I recall a great deal of times thinking ""wait, that was in Halloween,"" where the background is scarier than what could pop up out of the shadows with some loud sound surrounding it. The score in this movie is simply unnerving and remarkable. It adds to the tone and creates an even more frightening and uncomfortable feeling when ""it"" has appeared. It was as if I were watching a great Carpenter movie in the theater, and it's been a great while since such a possessing and haunting score has come along. It truly is like another character in the movie, but used so well it adds to already-present uneasy feeling that one has while watching.<br/><br/>It Follows delivers where other recent horrors have failed, it creates memorable moments and characters which the audience feels for. Also unlike recent films, there is no way to predict what direction the movie will take, and there is finally not a completely predictable ending. Horror movies have taken easy ways out and desensitized the audience throughout by having things jump on screen which make the ""big moments"" feel insignificant and forgettable because audiences have been jumped at so much they just don't care anymore and they're ready to see ""the monster die"" (I'm oversimplifying of course, but the intent is clear). Meanwhile, this film has (quietly) some of the most memorable terrifying sequences of the decade thus far.<br/><br/>Of course, I'd have a useless review if I didn't address the performances of It Follows. All of the other elements I've brought up in the review were almost created by, and greatly assisted by, the acting. If the acting is bad (which is a common thing in horrors), then it's hard to make anything else believable, which distances the audiences and takes away a lot of the sense of terror. The acting is so real by the cast that they make this plot seem genuine. They're not the usual teens that the audience can scream ""why did they not think of.."" or ""I would've.."" at. They address the horrifying situations as real people would, they're not magically filled with some convenient insight and they're not face-palmingly idiotic, either.<br/><br/>In a year filled with soon-to-be many blockbusters and money makers, It Follows will be remembered by many as one of the best of the year. It is a film that embodies all things horror, and pays great homage to what made people adore the genre. Like a good brand of medication, without the side-effects, It Follows is what the genre needed and is, to me, one of the best horror films of the decade to this point. With all of the key ingredients in place, we've got a great film here. 9/10."
"AriaofAngst","1","342","648","15 July 2015"," What the hell is wrong with people.
","I don't understand these raving reviews for this movie, this movie literally is a more graphic abstinence propaganda film. If you have sex before marriage with multiple partners you will die... maybe... If you walk really slow.<br/><br/>These kids clearly have parents, who seem to be okay with their kids running all over the country side with no accountability.<br/><br/>They didn't even follow their own established rules for this poorly established creature; At one point it is mentioned that if this thing touches you, you will die, So when chilling on the beach it grabs her hair she manages to get away, however a little later down the line it instantly kills her neighbor with sex... Uh alright I guess...<br/><br/>They never explain, or even bother trying to find out where it came from or why it just wants to sex people to death. Also they mention that ""IT"" will take the form of anything to get close to you, including people you love, however twice I think it was do we see it take on a form of anybody they know, once at the beach, and once as the neighbors mom. Would have made more sense to have ""IT"" just take the form of somebody you love so it could get you...<br/><br/>This was over-hyped trash and if I could get my money back, that would be great. Wish I could rate this 0/10. Weak Plot, Weak Acting, honestly where can I get some of that crack everybody who reviewed this positively is smoking?"
"bcjester","4","202","376","19 September 2015"," Don't know what to say.
","Over all I left disappointed and more confused than anything by the movie. Not by it's plot or by much of anything actually involving it but why I allowed myself to sit through most of it. Let me preface this review by stating this first: The movie itself is not horrible for the sake of standards, it's just not my type of movie and I will explain why.<br/><br/>When presented through trailers this seemed right up my alley. I enjoy horror films that can scare me silly and I have a massive(medicated) anxiety disorder so a creep following me everywhere. Easy I'm scared. Sadly that's not what happened. The movie started off strong with mystery and ambiguity towards the creature, but as it progressed it lost a great deal of that artistic vague nuance towards the being. What's worse is it did this without even fully explaining it. So it went from this mysterious demon/ghost/creature that has an unknown set of powers to something that will throw a rock through someone's window to kill them. Not exactly terrifying. The soundtrack did not sit right with me as artistic and retro as it was, which I can appreciate. It did not fit with a lot of the scenes. Some yes, but important ones no.<br/><br/>While trying to learn more about characters, and seeing their relationships develop I'd rather not listen to something that sounds like someone fell asleep on a synthesizer. It just pulled the mood right out.<br/><br/>For what it's worth the movie did in truth come across as a very well funded public service announcement.<br/><br/>All of that aside one of my main issues was the delivery. The scene at the pool she states she did not want to say what it looked like. I am not alone in thinking that it was going to show it's true nature and it was going to be glorious. We are however treated to a man in some shorts with a very well maintained hair style. Now watching this I'm wondering why on earth she didn't want to say what it looked like. It wasn't until after it was shot, bleed out in the pool and everything calmed down we see a photo of her and her father which the thing mimicked in appearance.<br/><br/>I was slightly baffled by the inconsistencies throughout the movie, and some scenes that did not need to be in it at all. (the kid looking through the window)I just couldn't find the chill factor after the first death on the beach where her leg was snapped. Which brought about another question. After seeing the young male dry-humped and what I believe to be literally drained of life. I was very curious as to why it broke a girl's leg who was sitting down on the beach waiting for death. Just did not make much sense.<br/><br/>Now it did do a great job capturing the fear of the main character early on when she began to scream after seeing her friend's water logged corpse walking towards her. Very good scene, very great camera play, amazing atmosphere. I just wish the rest of the movie followed through with that."
"pirateincognito","1","231","437","19 July 2015"," A Movie for Teens by Teens
","Do yourself a favor and watch another movie. I was deceived by IMDb's high rating. I'm giving this movie a 1-star to even out the high ratings. It should really be about a 4 or 5.<br/><br/>This is a scary movie about teens written by teens. The main character gets cursed by a walking ghost when she has sex with her high school date. The ghost begins following her no matter where she goes. If it gets close enough to touch her, she will die, and the curse will pass back to the previous person, her high school date. So she must have sex to pass on the curse and save herself! Except she'll never really be free because the curse will reverse when a victim is killed and move back to the previous person. The curse can kill all the victims up to and including the original person whom we know nothing about (this is actually explained in the film but it's never explained why or how they know this). Logically the only solution is to have lots of sex and there's no real danger of anyone dying.<br/><br/>What you end up with is 100minutes of fake scares with several PG13 sex scenes and a dead mom ghost mom humping her dead son (spoiler alert: the high school date dies)<br/><br/>The last person passes on the curse to a hooker, whom you assume dies because in the final scene you see the main character walking casually down the sidewalk care free because she passed on the curse, but behind her you can see the ghost walking."
"RomanJamesHoffman","8","173","323","13 July 2015"," Innovative horror that gets deep under the skin
","Jay (Maika Monroe) is a young, attractive girl coming-of-age who lives in the suburbs and, like pretty much every other young person, is finding out who she is through trial, through error, and with her friends for company. She is seeing a guy, Hugh, who acts a little odd sometimes but otherwise seems nice and trustworthy so one night she consents to his advances and they share an awkward but intimate moment in the back of his car. However, her post-coital bliss is cut short when Hugh inexplicably chloroforms her. She wakes up tied to a wheelchair in a derelict building where Hugh is rambling an apology about how he is doing this to her to show her that it's real, that it sometimes takes the form of someone you love to mess with you, and that she has to sleep with someone to pass on the curse. She is convinced he is maduntil she sees ""it"".<br/><br/>The rest of the film sees ""it"" stalking Jay. Fortunately, she is able to demonstrate the reality of ""it"" to her friends who band together around her, without the help from any adult authority, as they try to understand the nature of this thing and how they can help her friend given her reluctance to merely pass it along by sleeping with another poor unsuspecting horny teen.<br/><br/>Honestly, the culmination of the first act of the film, in the derelict building, came as a complete surprise: the scene showed me a fresh vision of horror which was genuinely scary and discomforting despite my jaded tastes. The slowness of the preceding scenes matured into a crushing, intense uncertainty when I realised that it wasn't what I expected from a horror and felt, for the first time in a long while, a sense of not knowing what I was watching.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie doesn't quite live up to this chilling reveal. To be frank, I can't think of how it could. Rather, the themes and references that led to the reveal are unpacked to flesh out the film's universe. We see multiple scenes of urban decay and adult authority figures are conspicuous by their absence. In addition, the refreshingly natural colour palette (not that grungy green which seems to characterise most horror movies these days) and a creepy score create a palpable sense of alienation and loneliness which mirrors the characters' confusion as they attempt to battle this malevolent force in the middle of the standard sexual and identity confusions of youth.<br/><br/>What's more, as the film progresses we realise that despite being set in the present the cars, TVs, and clothes seem to be imported in from the 80s. At first incongruous, as the film progresses I saw that these choices could be seen as an homage to the slasher movies of the late 70s/early 80s, especially John Carpenter's 'Halloween', with their subtexts of the dangers of unsupervised teenagers having sex which is clearly much of what 'It Follows' is concerned with. The result is a film which appears bold and fresh, but under closer examination reveals a fertile heritage of horror which it gains much from drawing upon and referring to throughout the runtime. However, all this is so artfully executed and to such a great effect that a familiarity with this lineage is not required and, moreover, the film still has much to offer those that are.<br/><br/>As it seems to be the case these days, horror movies without the tiresome jump-scares or which don't regurgitate haunted houses, creepy kids, or possessed girls get a lot of abuse from certain sections of the horror audience. If you like those tropes, avoid 'It Follows'. If you like fresh, daring, and thoughtful horror which lingers long after the film ends, watch it. Now!"
"markgorman","8","176","329","6 March 2015"," Completely original. Certain to become a classic. Wonderful addition to the best of horror lists.
","SPOILER: It Follows begins how it ends. <br/><br/>Mysteriously. <br/><br/>A young woman runs from her suburban home half dressed, terrified, confused.<br/><br/>She crosses the road haphazardly, then runs back to her house picks up her bag and escapes in her car, with her father shouting after her trying to work out what the hell is going on.<br/><br/>It is not explained.<br/><br/>The movie then unfolds. No captions. No narrative. It just unwraps itself in a way I have never seen in horror.<br/><br/>Whilst it nods at convention (the music is unquestionably influenced by early John Carpenter and the cast is a bunch of Sorority kids) it is completely original in every other way. <br/><br/>It's beautifully shot, carefully scripted without a single ham line and has a plot that is entirely unpredictable.<br/><br/>The basic premise is this. A ""thing"" (monster, demon, zombie, entity: call it what you like) is passed between couples having sex. And then it follows the 'host' until it is passed on to the next host, again following sex. <br/><br/>It manifests itself as a sort of walking zombie that follows the host. Should it catch them it will not only kill them but possibly all those in the chain behind.<br/><br/>That's easy to understand. What isn't is how our heroine Jay, played beautifully by Maika Monroe, attempts to resolve her plight. Really, this is a rare horror performance, understated and properly acted. Her fear is palpable. And she doesn't go wandering into unlit basements every five minutes. It's up there with Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween.<br/><br/>However, the plot becomes pretty confusing, but it kind of doesn't matter because throughout this great movie you're just taken in by its vitality, outstanding cinematography, freshness and the endless MacGuffins.<br/><br/>Seriously there must be 20 times you're expecting to be scared to death (Hitchcock style musical and SFX builds) only for nothing to happen.<br/><br/>Anyone walking slowly in this movie could be the 'entity' and that's repeatedly used as a trick. <br/><br/>Another great thing about it is the setting in Detroit. It's never overplayed but it adds a decaying creepiness that is entirely appropriate.<br/><br/>It's a great addition to the world of horror. Not as terrifying as some say, but absorbing and pure quality from start to startling finish."

""Oooo"".<br/><br/>How is that scary? Haha. Other than this you get no backstory and I felt they only ran around in circles trying to defeat this thing, by that I mean trying the same things over and over even though it did not work the first time... hilarious in a way. Such a stupid story, with bad acting. Not once was I scared and I watched it alone. It was not at all worth my time. Don't watch it. <br/><br/>To be honest I don't get how anyone can think this is anything other than trash. If you want to get scared for real I'd recommend Dead Silence (2007) or Grave Encounters (2011) some of my favorites in the horror genre."

","It Follows is the most refreshingly terrifying horror movie I've seen in the last year.<br/><br/>The movie begins on an exceptionally terrifying note, opening with a teenage girl fleeing from her house. She's running from someone - or something - but what? We have no earthly idea, but her fear infects us with an overwhelming and inexplicable terror. This opening scene sets the bar high for the rest of the movie, and we know that we will receive no mercy.<br/><br/>Director David Robert Mitchell knows what he's doing here. He knows what scares you, and executes it perfectly. With camera-work that can only be described as ""surreal"", we feel as if we are in a 100 minute long nightmare. The worst nightmares are the ones you know you can't escape from - you can't move fast enough, no matter how hard you try. At the heart of the horror film lies this simple, terrible truth: You cannot escape death.<br/><br/>In this nightmare, an inexplicable terror is following the protagonist. It's not a matter of WHAT is following her - per se - but rather WHEN it arrives. The inevitability of its coming is by far the most terrifying aspect of this movie. <br/><br/>These are actors you've never seen before, yet characters you know personally. The music score is one you've never heard before, but one you will never forget. This movie is a nightmare that you can't wake up from, and it is scary as Hell. You might as well be tied to your seat, forced to watch as an unstoppable, grotesque, demon-like entity walks slowly toward you...closer...closer...and closer. <br/><br/>This is how horror movies should be made. Fear should ""follow"" you, not ""surprise"" you. It Follows is easily one of the most terrifying horror movies of the decade. I recommend it 100%."

","Nothing scary about it. You never find out what exactly ""It"" is or what it wants or how it originated. Pretty pointless movie. It's basically a movie about passing a STD around, which apparently passing it on to someone else didn't help the problem since the original guy still saw ""It"". Filming was horrible too, most of the movie looked like someone was walking around with a video camera. I gave it 1 star because 0 wasn't an option. I'm flabbergasted at the people who gave this a good review. How anyone thought this movie even deserved 2 stars is beyond me.

","While I am not sure this film is as advertised, ""the best horror film in a decade,"" or how one would measure such a thing, my wife and I both enjoyed (I am not sure that is the right word) this film very much. <br/><br/>I think too often people confuse horror with slasher. Now, I am all about a nice Friday the 13th marathon, or the original Texas Chainsaw massacre, or even Halloween (1978 version), but these are not so much horror as slasher films. I think the distinction is important before one even begins to determine how they feel about a movie. Same thing with people who conflate a thriller like say, North By Northwest (a little old school, but hopefully you take my point) with a horror film. As my wife and I sat in the car trying to find the right adjective to describe this film, we landed on disturbing. The music was freaky, the concept of being pursed endlessly, any statement of sexual promiscuity the filmmaker might be trying to make, was all disturbing in our minds. <br/><br/>I would place this film with movies like Sinister, which my wife and I also ""enjoyed;"" best seen on a big screen with a massive tub of popcorn, holding the wife close.<br/><br/>I get that some people hate it; somebody always hates a film, song, TV show, play, book etc, while others think it is a perfect 10.

","The concept of this film can be somewhat innovative considering it doesn't take the ""regular"" things to become ""possessed"" - such as playing board games, running spirit sessions, harvesting corpses or collecting ancient objects from tombs.<br/><br/>That being said, the film is a straight down hill after the first scene. The way it started, it got me thinking ""wow, this is interesting.. Let's see what happens"". Oh boy, why? There is half a scene that can be considered scary and it's due to a freaking cat that jumps out on the screen (how original). The movie goes by slowly, most scenes are during the day, which has a significant impact on how scared you feel, plus the ""demon"" or whatever that is, isn't really scary. Also, if you're one of those people such as myself, who like some sort of explanation about things - even if vague ones - forget about it. It doesn't tell you what this is, how it has been generated nor how to get away from it. In addition, the characters are boring and they all pass the idea of being depressed. That doesn't make anything more scary, just weird and boring.<br/><br/>BUT, the worst is yet to come!!! The ending. Oh my God. This has to be the worst ending ever! Seriously. My girlfriend is addicted to terror movies and she has a very high tolerance towards terror movies. For some that I consider pure crap, she always finds something positive about, but for this one she looked at me after the last scene and said ""this movie is stupid. What a piece of crap"".<br/><br/>When I watched this movie, it was rated 7.2 here. Now it's rated 6.9 but I still think this is one of the biggest pranks ever, where everyone is rating high to make other idiots watch this movie and suffer.

","It is ironic how a film regarding abstinence could leave me feeling so violated.<br/><br/>I was so excited to see this film. With an excellent trailer & critical praise, I had a feeling this feature could truly add another rare horror classic to the arsenal of independent film. ""It"" might even usher in a new era of non-remakes/torture porn with a retro score I latched onto from the 1st decibels. I've always been a fan of John Carpenter and acknowledged the obvious influence for composer Rich Vreeland aka ""Disasterpeace"". & the concept was enough to pique my interests.<br/><br/>Sadly, as much leeway as I gave this movie, the aspects that attracted me from the trailer were, after viewing the entire run time, wasted on a moral statement dressed competently in horror: my genre of choice. The characters were annoying, stupid, incompetent, and they mumbled every word of dialogue at such a low volume that subtitles were required to not blow the speakers out from the booming score in comparison. I understand aside from the cinematography & editing that Vreeland's music was all ""It"" had going for it, but the same care crammed down the viewer's throats for a self-righteous declaration was not given for a standard audio mix. I felt judged, disgusted, and downright infuriated. If I wanted a sermon, I would have gone to church. Yes, this was a horror film, but after dedicating the 90+ minutes hoping my sneaking suspicions of the message were wrong, I wanted to hurt someone (namely the writer/director). My initial review was so scathing, profane, and was quoted as being ""pithy"". After spending sometime online, I came across a wealth of reviews on this stinker. They were predominantly-positive and gave an inaccurate view of what this offensive, flushable HD could have been. Avoid at all costs."

I was fooled into watching this, purely on that, and I feel cheated. I will never take IMDb ratings seriously again, because it is obviously rigged.<br/><br/>I also voted for all the one star reviews (there are so many!) in hopes they are bumped up to warn the unsuspecting potential viewer."

","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>Jay (Maika Monroe) is a high school girl who goes on a date that ends with a seemingly innocent sexual encounter. Soon after she finds herself being followed by a supernatural entity. She must find a way to escape this curse before it leads to her death. It Follows, is not the typical horror movie that depends on jump scares. Instead it uses a combination of atmosphere and soundtrack to deliver some really intense and chilling visuals. This is not a movie for everyone, with a fair share of weirdness that might put off certain viewers. On the other hand, the unique tone, sound design and visuals, caters to people who are aching for an original film in the horror genre.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>One of my favorite genres of film is horror, but I'm not blind to the fact that this genre is filled with movies of poor quality. Just look at last year with horrible releases such as Annabelle and Ouija. Then again when there is a good horror movie like Babadook, it can induce a roller-coaster of emotional reactions. I had high expectations for It Follows and personally it surpassed it.<br/><br/>When it comes to these films I prefer to be frightened by the things I can't see, playing off of the psychological terror of the characters. That was very well done by Maika Monroe as the lead. Quite frequently horrors have the dumb blonde who sleeps around, a cheap cliché that easily fits this premise. However, Monroe's character was more than this typical cliché. She's just an average teenage girl who happens to be a victim of unfortunate circumstances. You see how conflicted she is on how to handle this curse, whether to pass it on, involve her friends, or simply give up. Another horror cliché that is turned on its head is the topic of sex. Most of the time sex scenes are just added in scary films to attract a certain type of audience, but in It Follows sex is an integral part of the story. There is something deeply terrifying about being haunted for a very personal act. A supernatural entity infringing upon your most private moments is disturbing to say the least. Suffice to say It Follows is a horrible date movie.<br/><br/>Jump scares in scary movies are like shaky cams in action films, I absolutely hate them. The reason why I hate jump scares so much is because it diffuses all the built up tension in a scene, forcing that build up to start all over again. Thankfully I can only remember one time when It Follows used that trick. Rest of the time it was the atmosphere and the soundtrack that sent chills down my spine. Even when there was nothing happening the 80's synth music kept up that level of intensity. I also really liked the cinematography of the movie. From the very first scene with a fixed rotating camera, you know you are in for a very distinctive cinematic look. That distinct look is also there with the setting of the movie. You don't really know in which era this movie takes place. The characters will be watching black and white cheap sci- fi's on a bulky CRT TV while at the same time using an e-book to read off poetry. It's these little things that bring almost a fantastical element to the story, making the supernatural aspect fit perfectly into this world.<br/><br/>With all that said the big question is, was it scary? I'd say yes, because I was noticing every person that passed by me on the street while I biked back home in the night at almost 1:30am. I'd only caution that you be aware of the different tone of the movie, because if you are not expecting that (like my friend didn't) it can be jarring at first. In the end even if you happen to not like the movie it'd be hard to deny the originality of the movie. I loved It Follows for being totally weird while still being interesting and intense.<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"

","Sorry, but this movie is quite bad in my opinion.<br/><br/>I've read other reviews that compare it to J. Carpenter's work and... well, I guess some people just see what they want to see.<br/><br/>The plot is incredibly dull and the acting mediocre. This may be due to bad directing rather than the professionalism of the actors themselves, but there are no believable characters within it (not even the main one whom I thought wasn't too bad by herself).<br/><br/>The soundtrack might be the best thing of the movie, but it's not directed well enough, so there is a complete lack of suspense and rhythm to the movie. So much so that I actually fell asleep and missed a scene that I had to rewind to watch again. The photography is not as bad, but is not good enough for me to recommend the movie at all. <br/><br/>If you truly like the genre, don't waste your time with this movie regardless of how difficult it is to find a good horror movie these days."
"StevePulaski","8","77","145","30 March 2015"," Even through shortcomings and mixed ideas, the film's heart is always evident
","Right before I saw David Robert Mitchell's ""It Follows"" at my local theater, I was greeted with previews for forthcoming supernatural horror films like ""Before I Wake,"" ""Insidious: Chapter 3,"" and the remake of ""Poltergeist,"" all of which could've probably taken clips from one another and I wouldn't have even noticed. This is how basic and thoroughly unimpressive horror has gotten over the last few years and why we need to support films like this one. Is ""It Follows"" worthy of such praise along the lines of ""the best horror film of the decade,"" ""one of the scariest films ever made,"" and so forth? Sadly, no. I sometimes think critics either speak too soon or simply want to see their name stamped before advertisements, claiming such outlandish assertions that could not only be disingenuous to their actual viewpoints but, in turn, set unrealistic expectations up for films that leave the audiences disappointed.<br/><br/>Make no mistake however, for ""It Follows"" is definitely worth seeing and is bound to be one of the strongest horror films of the year. Even if we consider its few shortcomings and some instances of serious monotony, I'm more than happy to support this little festival darling and commend it for what it does well. As I stated, just before you settle into watch the film, you'll more than likely see previews for horror films made by people and studios who have simply stopped trying to make good, memorable films and copped out at settling for mediocrity. Here's to a film that went left when most of the pack went right.<br/><br/>After an opening sequence that hooks you from how absurd it is, we focus on Jay and Hugh (Maika Monroe and Jake Weary), a couple of twentysomethings out on a movie date. In the theater, Hugh notices a woman in a yellow dress, who apparently cannot be seen by Jay or anyone else, and orders her out of the theater. When the two are alone in their car, following sex, Hugh takes a chloroform rag to Jay, knocking her unconscious and ties her to a wheelchair. It's here when Hugh informs Jay that something has been following him for a long time but only he can see it. It often appears to be a naked woman, but can take the form of anyone, even the people you know and love, and passing it on occurs by having sex with another person. The soul will follow whomever is affected by its curse at walking pace, and if it catches up to Jay, it will kill her, and proceed to go after Hugh.<br/><br/>""It Follows"" is an early candidate for one of the most beautifully shot films of the year, and more than likely to be the most beautiful looking horror film of 2015. It has a delightful moodiness to its cinematography, captured crisply by Mike Gioulakis, as it uses a dark purple, gray, and teal color palette to look simultaneously uninviting and immersing. Colors like blood red boom with the feel and visual power that echoes Dario Argento, almost like an homage to ""Suspiria"" in look and feel. The story moves with the kind of slowburn intensity we've seen from horror directors John Carpenter and Wes Craven, or even Ti West, if we're talking more contemporary.<br/><br/>The real aesthetic treat here is how Disasterpeace's music combines with the film's cinematography. The use of heavy, bass-rattling synthesizers makes the film look and operate like a horror film of the 1980's to the point where looming tension becomes almost overcompensating in the way it appears to be taking over the entire film. The synths are loud and unsettling, and at times, can really propel the film to a suspenseful climax. Other times, however, they are obnoxious for the sake of being obnoxious and slightly disrupt the tonality Mitchell sets by making the film operate on a low-key playing field.<br/><br/>While the plot appears confusing, ""It Follows"" is surprising in how little there really is to it. Teenagers walk around, run from ostensibly nothing, comfort one another through sex and aimless conversations, and assure one another that it will all be okay amongst discussing different ways to combat this force. It's almost like Larry Clark made another horror film, as the tonal shifts feel like they're almost part of a coming of age film in addition to a horror film. These shifts aren't bad, however, as they function nicely to the film's more suspenseful elements by slowing the action down but never coming to a grinding halt. There's an unevenness, but it's not made as apparent as one would presume.<br/><br/>I find this is largely because of how well everyone works together here. With Gioulakis evoking consuming cinematography, Disasterpeace emphasizing a score that's alive and intense, Mitchell taking screen writing and directorial risks for his genre (employing long, clean shots that provide for a beautiful sense of location), ""It Follows"" is sound on almost all fronts. The only negatives that arise from the film are occasional structural burdens, or the fact that, towards the end of the film, its idea seems to change to fit the situation and create something unexpected.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, ""It Follows"" is a film to see and support, for it's one of those many opportunities we have as consumers that we keep blowing to see quality entertainment. It's almost like voting in elections; vote now and hopefully experience something that will satisfy you in the future. Even if ""It Follows"" isn't the perfect gem some have claimed, I'd rather see a pretty good independent horror film than a mediocre or downright abysmal carbon-copy that's spit into 3,000+ theaters with nothing but money in mind. There's heart in ""It Follows"" and that, at all times, is evident."

","I went into this movie excited to be scared. My roommate and his girlfriend had gone to see it and told me it was genuinely scary; the critics were raving about its originality, and I was ready for a tense, edgy, chilling experience. <br/><br/>What a sloppy, stupid, pretentious mess this movie was. What a waste of my time, my money and my life this movie was. Ignore the people saying that it's getting bad reviews only because it didn't have gore, explosions or jump scares; it's getting bad reviews because it barely qualifies as a movie it's so listless and insipid. <br/><br/>I'm sure by now the trailer's gotten around, so saying it's about a girl essentially ""catching"" a ghostly STD doesn't really count as a spoiler; I hope it also doesn't count as a spoiler to announce on here that that's it. That's all it's about. There is not character arc, there is no story, nothing. The characters are given absolutely no background aside from ""sister,"" ""friend,"" ""male friend"" and ""neighbor."" They mumble their dialogue, maybe to try to make it seem more important, or maybe because they're just terrible actors, either way it doesn't matter, this movie could have literally been shot with mannequins for how stiff the acting is. <br/><br/>But let me come to the biggest disappointment in a movie that is composed entirely of disappointment and failure: this movie is simply not scary. Not at all. Not in the least. It has the atmosphere of a godawful indie movie, which is too bad, because the premise of a following curse that you can't get rid of could have actually been extremely creepy and unsettling. Instead, I can count the creepy moments on one hand while I light a cigarette. <br/><br/>To sum up in tl;dr form: No story Bad acting Bad writing Waste of a great premise Waste of time Waste of money Avoid at all costs"

","That is the only way to review this film.<br/><br/>The goal of every journeyman film-maker from the beginning of the medium to the present, is to produce something that has the most impact per dollar spent.<br/><br/>Think of the first Night of the Living Dead. Shot on location with unknowns and local residents as extras. And the local butcher donated the entrails.<br/><br/>Think Ginger Snaps, which started as an obscure Canadian horror flick but found an audience because of the great writing and the charisma of its stars.<br/><br/>What we have here is another attempt to strike film gold by going for a high I/B ratio.<br/><br/>A small cast. Minimal special effects. No special sets or backgrounds.<br/><br/>A really clever idea, sort of a take off on the Ring which itself was a riff off a Japanese horror classic.<br/><br/>So what's the bottom line? Well done for what you get. Writer/Director Mitchell has a heck of a career ahead of him. Several ""jump out of your seat"" moments. And also a plot riff which you just know was contributed by some of the frat boys who crowd-sourced the film -- ""you can get rid of the curse if you just sleep with someone, fast!"" <br/><br/>The bad news? It is not in the same class as Living Dead or Ginger. There are lulls. There are gaps.

","After an innocent one stand, our antagonist Jay finds herself plagued with a mysterious virus, an unknown force, 'IT', that follows her around everywhere she goes. Throughout the movie Jay and her friends try to demystify this strange occurrence, which is always a few steps away.<br/><br/>The plot is original and very interesting to follow, however it is also relatively straightforward which does take some of the suspense away closer to the credits. Yet, 'It Follows' is shot and edited with a surgeon's precision, it is genuinely scary, extremely suspenseful and will leave you paranoid and holding tight to your seat on more then a few occasions. It is truly a horror film at it's finest, mysterious, terrifying and gripping.<br/><br/>Parts of this film, especially the ending reminded me of Kubrick's Shining, sometimes it feels very nostalgic, like you are watching bits of The Sixth Sense again. What makes this film truly great is the nature of the plot, the mystery behind it. 'IT' takes many forms, which at times makes it almost impossible to distinguish it from a normal human being, just like in real life in some way. The monster could be anywhere and anyone.<br/><br/>""It doesn't think. It doesn't feel. It doesn't give up.""<br/><br/>The soundtrack really stands out; It is perfectly in tune with the scene, surroundings and the plot. It gives you goose bumps even during the scenes where nothing is happening. Dark, classical sounds adds so much emotions, gives you a feeling that 'IT' is somewhere behind you, in the movie theater.<br/><br/>Even though all the actors' performances are rock-solid, this movie is really about the maestro. Written and Directed by David Robert Mitchell (his second feature film), this is all about his craft, his story and his ability to turn this story in one of the most refreshing horror films I have seen in years."

"paul-allaer","8","113","221","29 March 2015"," Ol' style scary movie delivers the goods, and then some
","""It Follows"" (2014 release; 100 min.) brings the story of Jay and her  friends as Jay is battling ""it"". As the movie opens, in the pre-opening  credits scene we see a teenage girl running out of a house, in obvious  terror of something that seems to be following her. She drives off in a  panic and later we see her mutilated body. After the opening credits,  we get to know Jay, another teenage girl, and her group of friends.  Eventually Jay and her boyfriend have sex in his car, and that is when  stranger things start to happen. To tell you more would spoil your  viewing experience , you'll just have to see for yourself how it all  plays out.  Couple of comments: this is the second full-length feature from  writer-director David Robert Mitchell, and this time he gives us a  scary movie worthy of that name. This is MILES away from so-called  scary (but in reality violence-porn) movies like the Saw franchise.  Instead this movie is reminiscent of the ol' style John Carpenter  movies. In fact, it is no accident that ""It Follows"" has a strong  1970s-1980s vibe (lots of old cars from that era, no cell phone, no  internet, no cable TV, etc.). The movie is set in and around Detroit,  and the city feels like it is playing a character itself in the movie.  Check out the scene where the group of 5 kids is driving through one of  the more harrowing parts of Detroit, seemingly a post-apocalyptic area,  and later the Detroit Swimming building. Kudos to Maika Monroe in the  leading role of Jay. I saw her most recently in ""Labor Day"" but here  she brings an outstanding starring performance as vulnerable Jay. I  couldn't help but be reminded of a young Cloe Sevigny. Last but  certainly not least, there is an outstanding electronic soundtrack,  composed by Disasterpeace (the stage moniker of Rich Vreeland), which  is equally worth seeking out.  After months of internet buzz and other hype, the movie finally opened  nationwide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it, even though as  such I am not a big fan of 'scary' movies. The early evening screening  where I saw this at was attended okay but not great, which surprised me  (I had expected a lot more people in the theater). It doesn't matter.  ""It Follows"" lives up to the hype, and then some. One of the better  scary movies I have seen in a long, long time. If you have a chance to  see ""It Follows"", be it in the theater, or eventually on Amazon Instant  Video or DVD/Blu-ray, do not miss it. ""It Follows"" is HIGHLY  RECOMMENDED"
"johnhammer-80294","8","88","169","29 March 2015"," Following in Their Footsteps
","Story/Setting <br/><br/>Our main character is a girl named Jay who is a petite, blond, and very pretty girl. She is surrounded by her group of close friends throughout the movie. One thing I really enjoyed about these friends is that they were very believable in a sense. I definitely could identify some of my friends out of the group which made the eerie story more close to home. The story takes place in a 70's like setting which can be identified with the characters' clothing, the vehicles these characters are driving, the technology, and other basic elements. These are definitely done very well, especially with how the characters interact. Many of the characters drink, smoke, and have sex with them being of a high schooler's age. The main plot is about a curse that is passed around through people (only teenagers in this movie) that is done so by an infected person having sexual intercourse with the other specimen. The curse implies that some ""thing"" will follow the person by walking at a casual pace and will kill him/her when ""it"" reaches them. If that person is killed, it goes after the previous person. Jay is given this curse by a boy named Hugh. This ""it"" is seen as someone the person may know or someone they've never seen before, but it will never quit hunting the prey. There is an obvious symbolism behind this which can be identified as STD's, as a sexually transmitted disease is lethal (at least in the 70's) and will follow you around your whole life. I believe the reason it is passed across in the movie is because when a person with an STD has sex with someone usually they don't want to tell the other person they have it, they don't want to scare them off. It brings relief to a victim of an STD that someone else they know has it, so that they can both endure it, just like with Jay and Paul at the end of the movie as they walk away hand in hand, with the ""it"" lingering behind them. I don't want to give too much away about this movie, but there are some other forms of symbolism and imagery throughout this piece. This is the one thing that the movie does to differentiate from its genre of horror. Jay is seen as the metaphor of growing up, the sense of innocence leaving her body. There are scenes of Jay eating ice cream while being comforted by her friends, Jay running away from the ""it"" as she takes shelter while swinging on the swing set where she would go as a child, and when she just wanted to go away from her parents with her friends. These forms of symbolic attitudes definitely seem prominent but not too obvious. Comparing It Follows to another movie titled ""Horns"", Horns has a lot of symbolic imagery included in its cinematography and story, but what it lacks is subtle expression. Obvious symbolic points are shoved down your throat during that movie with its references to biblical quotes and stories. It Follows definitely provides a lot of symbolism, but does it subtle so that you don't have a problem with it during your viewing of the movie and rather you contemplate it afterwards. Overall the story was very unique and kept its tone very balanced in the first and second act. The one issue that strikes me is the third act. Sharing a similar issue alongside with the recent horror movie by James Wan titled: ""Insidious"", the ending hurt the plot of the movie. At the end of Insidious we see the demon which plagues the main child's brain more often than not which expels some fear from us, when we don't see the monster as its lurking in the shadows we are more likely to become frightened. With It Follows and its ending, the monster appears at the pool for which the main group is hiding. Just like with Insidious or with the movie Sinister, the plot's balance is ruptured as it becomes more action packed. As I was definitely troubled by what the director chose to do with this scene, I was also very on edge by the Jaws like feeling when Jay was escaping the monster via swimming. The limitation that comes with this truly had me biting my nails. Overall it was a very interesting and unique storyline. <br/><br/>Cinematography/Composition<br/><br/>The camera work serves as an homage to 80's horror with its use of slow 360 degree pans and slow zooms throughout. These do become a bit excessive during the movie but what I enjoyed about it is how it served as a perspective giving the feel of searching, looking about. It became tedious at times but afterwards I grew to like what the director had to offer. I also enjoy the lighting in this movie, as it brings forth some familiarity with other directors such as Nicholas Winding Refn and his work on films like Drive and Only God Forgives. The Score of this movie is also very excellent with it's 80's like feel. It's made by a composer named Disasterpeace, definitely check him out.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>I found this movie to be intriguing and also thought provoking. I anticipated a basic screamer, gore fest while walking in. I kept imaging what the demon/monster/killer would be projected as and I was surprised about the direction taken. I came to enjoy the movie more once I was actually out of the theater. David Robert Mitchell wanted the feeling of being stalked to plague your conscious and bring fear close to home. I was frightened by this and I realized that the movie made me subconsciously alert. Even with the flaws associated with this critique, they are very easy to look past. I give this movie an 8/10. It's a great movie with some errors here and there."

","If The Sixth Sense scared the sh*t out of you when going to toilet at night, or Paranormal Activity made you afraid to stay at home alone, It Follows will definitely creep you out when walking back alone at night. After I saw this film, I would definitely run my ass off if I see anyone walking slowly behind me late at night. This film is a truly modern classic with its original and brilliant concept, all of which is put together nicely with its expertly directing and thought-provoking scares. The SCARES here are effective throughout thanks largely to its excellent soundtrack and intense sound effects that even though you can tell something is coming from its increasing volume of the music, but it will still effectively shock and gives you the chill down your spines when it happens. There are not many GORY scenes here but once it happens, it's definitely a terrifying one to look at. Overall, It Follows is not only the scariest film since The Conjuring but also one of the best ones worth watching before you die for its directing, concept, performance, music, etc, all of which comes together and works perfectly. It may have some funny moments along the way but once the scare comes, it's just expertly done and this film will surely scare the daylight out of you.<br/><br/>>>A-<<"
"kclipper","7","66","124","3 July 2015"," Original, creepy and worthy of modern cult-classic status
","Here is an exercise in atmospheric creepiness, eerie repugnance and downright unsettlingly intensity. This Little horror film from genre newcomer David Robert Mitchell, who wrote and directed this dark and weird tale of the supernatural, conveys unexplained phenomena in a twisted display of disjointed storytelling. ""Unexplained"" is the best way of describing the action that takes place, but metaphorically this film stands alone in its attempt to recreate and pay homage to the 1980's horror films dealing with teenage sexuality and its repercussions. It seems that there is this entity, and I feel that that's the only appropriate way to define it, an ""entity"" that can take any human form it wants and mark its victims consecutively as they engage in sexual relations with each-other. It seems confusing, but quite simple in fact. This supernatural entity is somewhat of a sexually transmitted disease that is only visible to those that are marked. It has super-human strength and cunning will follow, track down and perversely destroy those that it targets without emotion, feeling or remorse.<br/><br/>This atmospheric film, although quite incoherent and strange at times incorporates a ambiance that is obviously influenced by 1980's films by John Carpenter, and it achieves his approach towards mood and tension over character development and story. In other words, its a horror film for horror fans, and that's all. There is no explanation for the ""Hows"" or ""Whys"". It just is what it is, and the plot devices and suspenseful set-ups are on par with those great films of the 80's that got under our skin for no definable reason other than its sheer weirdness and paranoia. Maybe future sequels will build up towards a more precise explanation, but in the meantime, audiences will be enthralled by its mystery. Its a film that poses many questions, but continues to surprise and shock. That's all I can say without completely spoiling the fun, but I will say this much...The performances are believable, the music and mood are unbearably tense, and it has a psychological effect that is inexplicable. Look out for those most disturbing scenes...The swimming pool scene, and creepy next door neighbor standing naked on the roof of the house is a hoot. Remember, Be careful who you sleep with and always watch your back."

","I enjoyed the movie. The audience I was watching it with were a little weird at first (tittering and talking back at the screen, it was a film festival, they always seem to want to demonstrate their engagement with the the film early) But after a big fake scare early on, they settled down. The film was naturalistic for a horror film, the actors were wearing minimal makeup, the indoor settings looked to be locations as opposed to sets, and the performances restrained. It kind of reminded me of the Virgin Suicides, lots of girls with long blonde hair lying around and a story revolving around sex and death. The soundtrack was effective but it was definitely visually scary as well. It didn't rely solely on tricks to get its scares. The story jumped in places, and lagged in other places (the shots of expressionless blonde girls lingered too long to sustain my interest) It felt like there was symbolism, deeper meanings and themes running throughout, but i couldn't understand them. If I was meant to get something from the film it wasn't overt enough to be satisfying. However it worked on an entertainment level. The sequences I found to be most memorable were the wheelchair scene, the first attack in the house (especially the very tall man), the beach scene. The scenes I really didn't get was the boat scene, the pool, and the ending. I actually wanted the movie to go on a little longer."

And that is probably an understatement. You feel nothing from these characters at all, you almost want them do die halfway through the movie. Horrible acting, horrible writing, highly unbelievable story. I mean I know characters in horror movies are supposed to do the exact opposite of common sense but this just goes beyond that. I usually force myself to finish a movie in its entirety in one sitting just because I like to give everything a fair chance. Maybe there might be an amazing ended or twist that will make it worth the slow pace you know? But not this time, you start with nothing and are left with nothing. I found myself counting the minutes until this ended and almost rejoiced just because it was over. Horror is my favorite genre but I gave up on them about 5 years back just because the truth is they just don't make good horror anymore, and this movie is pretty much the spokesperson to that very point. All in all I cannot think of anything I enjoyed about this movie except for the fact that its over and I feel like I should clean out by blu ray drive for having the garbage in it for the time it was, good God people do not believe the hype at all. You would have more fun watching your dog take a dump outside than watching this, do NOT, I repeat do NOT believe the ratings on this one, I almost feel violated for even having watched it."

","Great movie. Returns the awesome score, the minimalism. Just a straight up fun horror movie from old times. If you loved Halloween, this movie is a straight up good time. It's full of style, full of dread, full of creep you the hell out. This movie is relentless. You will be on the edge of your seat the entire time. The character development is amazing and something you don't see much of in horror movies these days. It's just amazing. However, while I praise the originality and score, I have to dock some points. Why you ask? Well, the premise and metaphors are obviously anti-sex, they also tell the protagonist to have sex to pass on the curse. Also it never states how the curse first began. I can forgive that assuming it explains in a later sequel. Still awesome movie. Something that's not like the norm. You won't see much blood or guts, but it will play with your mind and you will never see people in crowds the same again. It stays with you. This movie will follow and inspire for movies to come. 10/10 for premise, score, and originality. 6/10 for explanation. Overall 10/10 movie that I give 8/10 because it doesn't give quite enough."

And it's all around good, well played, good sound effects, more suspense, less gore, it has all the elements you expect in a horror movie, and at the same time it is not cliché. The real highlight here is the director, this movie is exceptionally well directed, I mean frames and shot composition makes the movie jump from the screen. If you like horror and not gore movies, watch it. Yes, the movie is a bit slow at first, but it didn't bored me at all."
"gregsrants","8","141","281","10 September 2014"," Unique
","Unique. That is the word that first comes to mind after a screening of  David Robert Mitchell's It Follows which has now shown twice to  accepting audiences at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival.  It Follows is the story about a sexually transmitted haunting. Let me  repeat that sentence so that in sinks in a little bit. It Follows is  the story about a sexually transmitted haunting. The haunting is all  too real for teenager Jay (Maika Monroe). After a brief sexual  encounter with a new boyfriend, Jay is haunted by ghosts that only she  can see. Their intentions are not clear, but an opening scene of a  disfigured young girl on the beach reveals to the audience that the  ghosts are violently inclined.  The carrier that inflicted Jay with the haunting reveals to her and her  inner circle that the ghosts will be relentless until they kill Jay. He  goes on to disclose that the ghosts can only walk to their prey. So if  you can run, drive or speed away from them it might buy you minutes,  hours or even days until they catch up. The only way to pass on the  haunting is to have sex with another and this knowledge torments Jay  while intriguing the two male suitors that are part of her friendship  ring.  Whether Jay can pass on the hauntings enough so that she herself is  safe and whether her friends will play a part in her survival is the  crux of the film that hearkens back to the glory years of horror where  blood and guts were not paraded out in gore porn glory.  Director David Robert Mitchell confidently maintains the integrity of  the story without the lure of upping the body count for the purpose of  appeasing a microwave horror generation that wants its blood and wants  it thick.  In fact, the body count is so low in It Follows that a leper can count  them on one hand. This lack of blood and guts however only adds to the  atmosphere that is thick and complimented by one of the best musical  scores for a horror film that we have relished since the early John  Carpenter years.  The idea is truly original and its execution is brilliant in its  simplicity. An experiment which attempts to destroy the ghost reminded  us slightly of 1981's The Entity (in which Barbara Hershey was raped by  a sexually abusive spirit) but It Follows maintains its originality to  the end.  In a Hollywood world where horror films are stereotypically deformed  serial killers who randomly kill high school students on the brink of  sexual revelation, It Follows is a breath of fresh air that is worthy  of a high recommendation. Unique indeed."

","It Follows- R, 2015 ➡️At no time in my life would I have thought that a film about STD's (By STDs I mean sexually transmitted demons 😱) could scare and unnerve me like ""It Follows"" did. This is director David Robert Mitchell's second effort that further proves his status as a rising star in Hollywood. It Follows is a stylish horror trip that acts as a pseudo-homage to '80s slasher films while also managing to breathe new life into a struggling genre. The film ""follows"" J (played amazingly by Maika Monroe) , a college student who ends up sleeping with her boyfriend and, in the aftermath, is told that she has now contracted a demon that will follow her until she is dead. She must pass this demon on or risk facing her own death and haphazardly killing everyone who has had it before her. The film drops the audience into an '80s era suburbs that is busting at the seams with something that is hard to put a finger on but is no doubt nefarious. The camera movements and long tracking shots mean there Is no break from the film and we have no choice but to watch the horror that is about to occur on the screen. Great scores stay with you long after watching a film and the ethereal soundtrack from It Follows has yet to leave my mind. Mitchell does an excellent job of maintaining suspense throughout the film and treats the audience intelligently by not succumbing to an overuse of childish jump-scares. This is one of the many flaws that plague the horror genre today because jump-scares diffuse tension instead of increasing it and come off as a cheap gimmick to get people's butts in the theaters. This film is not without flaws itself though as certain characters perform certain actions that are based in no common sense and their stupidity took me out of the film. The parents in this film are no where to be found which takes away from the believability of the film. The film is excellent at exploiting one of humanity's, especially teenager's, biggest fear which is undoubtedly the contraction of an STD. It Follows is an unnerving and insane horror film with an explosive climax that will leave you buzzed upon leaving the Theater! #8/10 #ItFollows"
"ferguson-6","7","76","146","9 February 2015"," Tag, You're it
","Greetings again from the darkness. Known for an endless stream of copycats and re-treads, the horror genre periodically surprises us with a dose of originality. Heck, we don't even ask horror filmmakers for anything too revolutionary  just give us something we haven't seen a few dozen times before. Writer/director David Robert Mitchell ""gets it"" and delivers a game of psycho-sexual-tag-you're-it featuring the most sinister STD ever.<br/><br/>A definite departure from the all-too-common teen slasher films, the slow-drip terror of this one has more in common with dread and eventuality than scream-inducing terror and ""made you jump"" scares. When we first meet Jay (Maika Monroe), she is a typical pushing-twenty student who enjoys leisurely swims in her suburban backyard pool, hanging out with friends, and a healthy dating scene. Well, healthy until one evening of back seat passion with Hugh (Jake Weary) sets off the above-mentioned sinistry. See Jake has purposefully ""passed on"" some kind of affliction that attracts a death-seeking entity who slowly, but purposefully pursues its target. Supposedly the only options are to be killed or pass it on through more passion  the worst kind of ""pay it forward"".<br/><br/>Jay is supported in her ongoing attempts to avoid the entity by her sister Kelly (Lili Sepe), her neighbor and classmate Greg (Daniel Zovatto), and Paul (Keir Gilchrist) her not-so-secret admirer who would do anything to protect her. The big catch is that only Jay can see the entity  making heroism quite elusive for her support group.<br/><br/>Lest there be any doubt of the dire situation, director Mitchell begins the movie with a very vivid example of the likely result in being ""caught"" by the entity, and adds the score from composer Disasterpeace  an ominous throwback techno-sound that would be distracting if not so fitting. This has all the makings of a breakout role for Maika Monroe, with similarities to Jamie Lee Curtis in the original Halloween movie (1978).<br/><br/>The low budget caused some obvious production limitations – in particular an awkward bounce from day to night and back again, and some iffy effects. However, the suburban Detroit setting provides a nice backdrop, and of special note are the Redford Theatre (est 1928) replete with its beautiful pipe organ, and the indoor swimming pool put to spectacular use in the film's climax. As long as the audience is not expecting the typical teen slasher, this creative horror film should gain an audience while putting director David Robert Mitchell on the fast track to bigger budget films."
"dccohen-1","9","131","262","12 September 2014"," What modern horror has always been about!
","Caught 'It Follows' at TIFF Midnight Madness and it was a real treat. Not only is it a creative take on what has become a 'by the book' teen horror genre, but there are some legitimately creepy and tense scenes. But perhaps the most interesting aspect of 'It Follows' is that it is set in a timeless time, and feels closer to a fairy tale than anything else. We find cell phones mingling with black and white TVs, and there isn't a parental figure to be found when the going gets rough. This is a particularly clever move when the 'entity' in the film is also something we know nothing about, and potentially timeless! Most importantly, so much horror, particularly modern horror, is obsessed with sex. 'It Follows' plays on this concept with much success."
"MovieLoversAnonymous","8","86","167","29 March 2015"," Demonic STD
","One of the most trying questions I always have for my friends whenever they have just seen a horror film that I have yet to see, is whether or not the film was scary. After all, what good is a horror film if it's not horrifying? I saw ""It Follows"" yesterday, and I was disappointed at first, but I slowly changed my mind.<br/><br/>Jay Height is a teenage girl who is about to have sex with her boyfriend for the first time. She soon learns that her boyfriend has some kind of demonic STD that causes an evil presence of some sort to follow you until it kills you (hence ""It Follows""). The other way to get rid of this thing is to pass it on by having sex with someone.<br/><br/>Jay Height is played fantastically by the up-and-coming star of the movie, Maika Monroe. She shows fear in a very realistic way, and her on going struggle to deal with her fear. One thing this film did that I highly applaud, is that it didn't try to pull the ""you are just crazy, we don't believe you"" cliché. Clearly there was some messed up experiences going on with Jay, her friends realize that, and they try to deal with the situation. No time wasted on trying to convince everyone that she isn't crazy (which way too many horror movies do). The score to the movie was also excellent, and it set a classic 80's horror movie vibe, which was great. And of course, the premise (demonic STD) was very original so I didn't feel like I had seen any of this before, which is a lot to ask for in a modern horror movie unfortunately.<br/><br/>One of my few gripes with the movie is that it's not very scary. There are a couple jump scares here and there, and some parts will send a shiver up your spine, but I didn't leave the theater looking over my shoulder or anything like that. I don't feel like the movie tried to be scary, and I was left sitting there though. Instead, I feel like It Follows was trying to be a chilling thriller, and it succeeded. The fact is, when this movie comes out on blu-ray, I am going to buy it.<br/><br/>It Follows puts a very unique twist on the thriller/horror genre, and it is a very good movie in that right. 8/10"
"mober1996","8","93","182","4 April 2015"," One of the most disturbing movies I have had the pleasure of watching
","It would be appropriate to open up a review on this film by saying one thing about this film. It's that this film definitely has a.interesting concept behind it. This movie takes the modern day horror and flips it on its head. How does it do this? STDs.not kidding. Parents with teenage children, if you want to convince them not to have sex, feel free to show them this film. Because it is basically a huge metaphor of why STDs are terrifying.<br/><br/>Now all jokes aside, despite the strange concept, this movie had some PHENOMENAL execution. I did not feel anything less of creeped out and even grossed out throughout this entire film, which is exactly the type of feeling you're supposed to receive from a film such as this. I felt disturbed, anxious, tense, and many more emotions which were all exceptionally delivered from this film. It draws your attention with its interesting plot, and then keeps you watching with its many different ways of keep you on the edge of your seat. The biggest way they do this is by keeping you and the protagonist aware of the monster, but throws in a characteristic for the monster that keeps it hidden to the other characters. So I kept finding myself see it/or someone else with similar behavior to it in the background and kept saying to myself ""OH S*** OH S*** OH S***!""<br/><br/>The atmosphere was incredible, there are is an appropriate number of jumpscares, and most of the scary moments are more of a reveal to something, or the constant tense moments that it keeps throwing at you. Normally, when I have a certain number of tense moments thrown in my face, I tend to be like ""Oh OK I get it just stop."" But for this movie, it actually works because you know that the monster is always following, and that it can come up at any time. It leaves you waiting and on the edge of your seat the entire time because you want to know where it is.<br/><br/>I only had a few problems trying to follow of a few things in this movie. There would be some moments where they would imply or hint at something happening, then make it seem later like that ""thing"" didn't happen. So you're left it your seat wondering ""Wait, so did they back off last second, or did it actually happen? I'm confused!"" But that could be my only serious problem that hurt my experience. Because there was no clearance to it.<br/><br/>In general though, this movie has some of the most phenomenal and well done execution of an original idea that I have seen in quite a long time. They never strayed or added or bull**** to the original concept, and made it work in a spectacular way. I would definitely watch this movie again if it were put in front of me.

I had never seen camera angles in horror films like this before which really helped build the tension and suspense that this film has so much of.

"SLUGMagazineFilms","Null","89","174","24 January 2015"," An Advanced Teenage Horror Film: Expertly-Crafted, Psycho-Sexual Drama
","David Robert Mitchell's It Follows cannily takes the torrential world of the contemporary American teenager and uses it to bring the horror film back to its visceral roots—those dirty little tendrils that obscure the collective fears of our modern society. Today's teenagers live in a bigger, more accessible world — a world in which the idea of the masked bogeyman lurking in the backseat has become clichéd to the point of being used as a Geico commercial. This is a truth that Mitchell understands completely, and his dissection of the paranoia and emotional detachment that plagues our suburbs is the genesis of this fresh interpretation of the horror genre. Following a sexual encounter with an older man, Jay (Maika Monroe) finds that she is being followed by a malevolent entity that will only leave her alone if she sleeps with someone else. This terrifying scenario throws Jay and her friends into a nightmarish game of trying to keep one step ahead of the relentless creature. Cinematographer Michael Gioulakis captures the unyielding dread that permeates the narrative with wide shots that evoke the eerie perspective of a hunter stalking its prey. It Follows feels like a natural progression of the teenage horror film—one that uses the complexity of today's young people as a canvas for some expertly-crafted, psycho-sexual drama."

From what I can gather... it is literally the videotape from The Ring. The only way it could garner that kind of score is if people felt this supernatural compulsion to make others suffer as they have. Prometheus was better than this. Nicolas Cage's version of Left Behind was better than this! This is, without a doubt, the worst movie I've seen in years!<br/><br/>Do not watch It Follows!!!

"trublu215","4","114","227","11 March 2015"," A tense and unique horror film.
","It Follows tells the story of a a sexual encounter gone bad. While this whole premise feels familiar in one way or another, director David Robert Mitchell manages to inject enough originality and genuinely disturbing images into this scary and tense horror film that is bound for cult glory. The film follows (no pun intended) Jay, an all American girl from the Detroit suburbs who dreams of meeting ""the one"" and having a summer love. As one would expect, it soon turns into a hellish nightmare that ends with a looming, potentially deadly force lurking behind every corner of her life. The film takes twists and turns throughout the way, but the best part about this film is the sense of dread in every scene. It weighs down as heavy as bricks until some truly disturbing visuals make this film go from dreadful and suspense filled to absolutely horrifying. The suspense builds and builds with this film and when it finally releases the tensions with a scare, it becomes almost unbearable to look at the screen without your hands in front of your face. The performances in this film, outside Maika Monroe, are pretty flat. This surprisingly doesn't really affect the film as bad as you would think. There's enough of a good performance coming from Monroe to carry this film to the finish line and then some. My only gripe with this film is that it is really ten minutes too long and feels as though it starts dragging in the second act. These scenes that slow it down are not necessarily bad or poorly done, it just feels as though Mitchell could have maybe left a bit more on the cutting room floor. In retrospect, this is a minimal problem. This is a horror film that is scary and truly unique. In an industry that produces crap films with cheap scares, it is very refreshing to see one that actually takes the genre seriously and delivers some serious scares. It is definitely worth watching and I highly recommend it."

There was absolutely no back story, and the acting was terrible. I laughed through the whole entire movie. ""It"" is literally just a paranormal STD. And I was pretty sure Jay was going to end up with a real STD. The whole movie is incredibly tacky. Like when she and Greg had sex in the hospital. Seriously? That couldn't have been done any better? Cause there aren't windows or doors people could've seen through. There are so many random people. Why do all her friends stay in her house every single night? Don't they have lives? And there's that one friend who is sleeping in 90% of the scenes she is in. What's the point of her being in the movie? Also, when after was killed, the only thing I could think was ""HE'S BEING HUMPED TO DEATH!"". A good way to end this movie would've been if Jay was hit by a car when she was running over to Greg's house. Also, how do you shoot something that no one can see? Something paranormal? The end was so predictable, and they all made such bad decisions that I'm surprised none of them died within the first half hour. Also, talk about being friend-zoned. Poor Paul. My friends input was ""She's going to be a whore by the end of this movie! I'm surprised she hasn't gotten a real STD yet!"" Another issue, why was ""It"" always naked? Where did ""It"" come from?

","No matter how far you go or how far you run, it follows. But just remember - it simply walks to you. So your best shot is to keep running. That or you could pass it on. <br/><br/>David Robert Mitchell's horror tale is a perfectly written thriller buffed up quite beautifully by brilliant actors like Maika Monroe, Keir Gilchrist, Lili Sepe, Olivia Luccardi and Daniel Zovatto. The background score is simply outstanding and it gives an enthralling charm to the theme of the movie. Frequently used high notes that get exscinded often for emphasis complement the enactments quite impeccably. <br/><br/>Direction is simply outstanding. David chooses subtle ways to depict the mundane, like not for a second does he waste his frames on the protagonist's family. Occasionally he would insinuate family members through photo frames, mirrored reflections, and blurred eyes, but he would never actually bring them into focus. David depicts how estranged one's family becomes at a certain age, and manifests how they levitate in the background of a teenager's life. His incessant single takes are top-notch. The rotating camera technique, the rear window view to capture crucial moments and the constant follow- through are a delight to watch.<br/><br/>One of the most wonderful things about the flick is that people close to the protagonist don't simply pass into the oblivion. Unlike clichéd horror movies, they don't become victims. They impart meaning to the word ""friendship"" by sticking together no matter what and by trying to overcome a problem at hand boldly. Jay's keen eye is captured marvelously as she watches trees, insects, shrubs, everything that brings her closer to nature. <br/><br/>Screenplay is also very well written. The movie carries a brilliant gravity throughout its runtime which is furbished quite nicely by the occasional badass score that elevates the entire movie-viewing experience. <br/><br/>The flick ends abruptly at a high note that leaves the audience brooding. The closure is open to interpretation which deliberately forces your thoughts towards what's impending. An exceptional movie! But I am afraid, not for everybody. I am saying this because those who came in for a horror punch seemed disappointed and duped."

","Just like it's antagonist, It Follows moves along just slow enough to build the atmosphere, but just quick enough to keep it from feeling like a dirge to watch. We follow Jay who unwittingly takes the curse from a handsome peer she's dating. He kindly lays out the curse to her, and shows her the Follower so she knows what to expect, and then dumps her on her doorstep and disappears, leaving her to survive this ever-present threat to her well-being, while simultaneously getting her friends in on it to help her out.<br/><br/>Crucially, the story knows not to reveal too much about anything. The Follower is never named, and the only things we know about it are what we're told by one of the characters, who is at best taking a good guess. This leaves a lot of wiggle room not just for the writer to shake it up a bit when required, but also for the audience to ponder long after the film has ended. What happens if you go overseas? What happens if the curse reverts back to someone who has already died? Can it climb? Can it swim? How much reasoning does it really have? And importantly, what would you do to shake it? The ambiguity is also present as the film starts to reach its climax. There's a couple of moments that are deliberately left open, and your interpretation of what happens between cuts affects how you view the movie's final act. For instance, Jay sees a group of three guys on a boat and swims out to meet them, but we cut before any implied sexual activity. Did she go through with it, or did she change her mind? Depending on which interpretation you take may lead you into different avenues with the film's ending.<br/><br/>On this point the film has a lot to say, but what that is exactly is also open to interpretation. Horror movies are at their best when they have a metaphorical or satirical element. It Follows absolutely has some of these elements, even if they might not be that obvious. Even when viewed on a surface-level basis, It Follows is a strong film, but when you start to delve deeper and pick up on all these tiny little details, a new narrative starts to emerge. What does the Follower represent? Is it a sexually transmitted disease like HIV? Is it a metaphor for sexual maturity? Does it mark a loss of innocence and running away from responsibility? Does it try to say something about abuse, and how the abused often become the abuser? Is it an article on promiscuity? The fact that this movie can touch any and all these themes at the same time is a display of expert writing and attention to detail.<br/><br/>Talking of detail, there's so much here once you start to scratch the surface. The use of colours, clothing, and the symbolism of water are all extremely important in picking up on the subtler themes. The Follower, in all of it's seen guises, appears in white, either in underwear, nightwear, or completely naked. No-one is seen in red until they've contracted the curse, and blue is a prominent marker for innocence. Water, also being blue, proves to be a big thing in the movie. It both precludes the Follower and marks as it's weakness. A number of scenes take place on the beach or by the shore, whether it's the girl's last stand at the beginning, or the last place Jay and Hugh go before doing the deed. The pool in the back garden is a comfort of simpler, more innocent times, while the pool that features as the stage for the climax hearkens back to Jay and Paul's first kiss when they were kids. The draining of the former and the colouring of red of the latter are sure to have some kind of deeper meaning behind them, depending on which subtext metaphor you like the sound of most.<br/><br/>As if the writing and direction wasn't enough display of It Follows being a mastercraft, it has style out of the wazzoo. The cinematography is on overdrive, always aware of the angles it's creating and the frames it lives in. It focuses on the foreground while making an effort not to obscure the background and whatever may be lurking back there. Attaching the camera to the foot of a wheelchair so that it shakes and shudders as the chair does is disorientating, and a full circular rotation around a high school hallway reveals new details with each pass. Even when the cinematography isn't being obviously clever, it composes each scene in such a way that is oddly pleasing to the eye, while also maintaining it's dreamlike surreality that builds the atmosphere. The combination of camera placement, lighting, and colour give the movie an aesthetic quality that's often worth framing.<br/><br/>The music deserves mention as well. Composed by Disasterpeace, it has a very John Carpenter feel to it, while also not feeling dated. It's not full-on 80s synthwave, but it errs pretty closely. Themes weave in and out and prove to be such an important ingredient to the film's atmosphere. Like any good score, it highlights moments and builds suspense, but without feeling cheap. It's melancholic and disturbing in equal measure. Just listening to it while sat alone writing this review made me feel unsettled, like something was going to creep up on me, and yet I enjoyed the music separately so much that I put it on repeat.<br/><br/>It Follows is absolutely one of the finest horror movies in recent memory. It picks atmosphere over cheap scares, it's expertly written with a mind for themes and ambiguity, it's beautiful to look at and entertaining to listen to. It doesn't pick substance over style, but keeps both to the benefit of each other. Fantastic movie, would recommend, will watch again. 9/10."
"laszlo-janszky","1","75","145","19 November 2015"," Worst movie I ever watched till the end
","It's hard to tell anything. The whole story is that some zombie like creature follows and kills people who have had sex with each other, so it is something like an STD. I guess the thing is envy because it rapes the victims, ohh and it is supernatural!, because it is invisible to not infected ones and it cannot be killed by headshot unlike regular zombies^^. What a brilliant idea, truly amazing! pff... That's all, no more, no less.<br/><br/>As you can see that story is really bad, actually there is no real story, just these 2 sentences. There are many logical flaws in the movie, for example kids have been shot with pistol, but the doctors don't bother to call the police or talk with the parents that they should not let kids play with the guns. Another strange thing they repeat multiple times, that somebody broke into the house, but no adult is ever home, only kids, always. The thing can throw ~50kg bodies like puppets, but it cannot walk through a closed door made of approx 0.5cm thick wood, it has to knock. In one of the last scenes it climbs through fences, breaks in secret facilities, or something like that, it swims, and so on. So it behaves really inconsistently, and people behavior is far from realistic. I assume the authors did not really know what they wanted. The acting is more or less okay, they are kids, so don't expect too much. I would rather blame the director and the script writer. (If there is one, I am not sure about that.) I watched it only because I was able to skip the boring parts with double speed and because I thought there will be some explanation at the end. I was mistaken... I could have slept for 2 hours instead. :S"

"palombo-angelo","8","91","179","1 April 2015"," Finally!
","Finally! A horror movie that doesn't involve a weird demon baby or any demon at all for that matter! 'It follows' is about a young girl in college named Jay who has sex with this guy she's dating, and he passes on some sort of ""thing"" that will (you guessed it) follow her. This movie was undoubtedly creepy and it has one of best scores i've ever heard in a horror film. I wouldn't say that this movie was ""scary"" (except for a certain scene where i almost cried) but it was creepy, very unique, and disturbing. 'It follows' basically treats us (the audience) like the characters. We do not know crap; which most likely makes the experience more terrifying. The unknown, in my opinion, is scarier than seeing the real thing behind it all, and this movie doesn't give us any damn information which i liked. There was also a lot of clues scattered throughout the movie that you had to pay attention to notice; which i didn't the first time around. Overall this movie was very good in my opinion. It wasn't a huge budgeted over the top horror film that was using CGI every second or relying on jump scares every moment. It was stylish, had great background music and characters, and the ending may make you upset, but when you think about it, the ending has a great meaning to it and it not typical. 8/10"
"kurtrvader","9","91","179","30 March 2015"," PTSD from my PSTD
","Yes, this movie is about a paranormal sexually transmitted disease. <br/><br/>The plot is simple. Girl gets a PSTD from having unprotected sex with a guy, which causes her to be chased by ghosts only she can see. She must have sex to pass on the PSTD, but once the ghost kills the new carrier it will come back for her. <br/><br/>So what makes this movie so good? The atmosphere. The sets, the music, the clothing. It's all amazingly cool like it was pulled out of 1982, yet it takes place in the modern day suburbs of Detroit. There are VHS tapes laying on the table. One of the guys wears a totally rad stonewashed jean jacket. They all have tube TVs, even though they live in a well to do neighborhood. My girlfriend and I were left wondering if maybe the characters in this film were actually ghosts themselves who died in the 80s.<br/><br/>The film is a wonderful and loving homage to the horror movies of old from the late 70s and early 80s. We absolutely loved it!"

","When I read that the director was going for a warning for teens not to have sex because an STD would follow them around until they die, I thought it would be funny. But nope, this movie is straight up boring!! Painful to watch, with bad dialogue and even worse acting, it does come off as laughable-- unfortunately not in an entertaining way. The teens reaction to someone as benign as a little grandma or grandpa slowly.... and I mean slllllooooooooooowwwwwwwllllllllyyyyyy walking towards you, is the opposite of terrifying.

"Angelika_New_York","4","13","20","2 July 2017"," Another disposable film that had really great marketing.
","So I finally got around to watching It Follows, which was released in theatres a couple of years ago. It wasn't a film I was highly anticipating, if at all. It seemed mildly interesting. I suppose I almost got sucked into that way of thinking that it appears to be a different kind of horror film of today, and it kind of is, and although I appreciate a unique story, what it really comes down to is that it's just silly.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, it is pretty high up on creating an atmosphere and it is creepy. Basically, sex is the theme of the story and the consequences that follow. A person will soon be followed bydead people, ghosts who will murder their target. Hmmm Well, the first half is definitely better than the second half because it plays out as more psychological. Could it really be all in the mind of the protagonist? I think that is the strength of this film. Also, I must point out that the cinematography helps achieve its effectiveness; engaging, cool camera-work. Now getting around to the second half of the movie, I wanted one of the side characters to say something like, ""If this thing that's following you isn't real, then there's no reason to be threatened by it, right?"" It never happens. It seems that Jay, the central character, was the only one who could see who is coming after her even when her friends were right by her side. Another question is, in what ways could an unseen force kill someone? Where I'm getting at is I like the psychological aspect of it, unfortunately, however, that isn't the whole film.<br/><br/>The film goes by mostly at a steady pace. Then I checked at the 1 hour and 15-minute mark, thinking that there must be a conclusion approaching really soon, and then there were 25 minutes left. The realization of the silliness of the plot becomes more apparent at that point. If there were about sixteen, seventeen minutes chopped off, and with tighter editing, then perhaps the film could improve significantly. There really was no need to stretch it out for as long as they did. Also that the characters weren't really worth being concerned with, which unfortunately is the case with many movies like this. <br/><br/>Speaking of, this isn't really a horror film by the way, which is fine; it needn't be. It's basically a suspense/thriller. The body count is practically non-existent. Just an observation; not necessarily a strike against the film. This is just another disposable film that had really great marketing. Bravo! ""A new kind of horror"" as some critics have said and it paid off. People will defend it because it's basically divergent from what is mostly out there today. But I think that just because something is different doesn't necessarily make it good. I would give it a C-"
"oakpill","8","89","176","6 April 2015"," A new cult genre film for the next generation...
","Highly stylized and detailed production. I loved the anachronisms throughout the film. It took place in a world that was both familiar and unfamiliar. Little things here and there that didn't make sense, but seemed intentionally out of place. Like Kubrick, it gave you a strange sense of displacement. <br/><br/>The music was a nice touch. Utilizing unconventional musical motifs is becoming more common, but it is not often executed so well as in this film. The blend of retro, minimalistic 70's / 80's instruments evokes a different dimension of emotional depth. It evokes the great soundtracks from The Shining (Wendy Carlos), The Virgin Suicides (Air), and Donnie Darko (Michael Andrews). The soundtrack created a sense of gravity that I think a conventional score would not have been able to convey for the purposes of this film. <br/><br/>The story was inventive, and I loved the dynamic of the creature that follows. Early in the film, they establish just how dangerous this ""thing"" is, and what it's capable of masterfully. It was understated, and allowed the director to really utilize some incredible tension near the middle of the film. As a veteran horror film buff, I was both uncomfortable and grinning at the same time. Particularly the scene where it first breaks into Jay's house, and the creature confronts them in an enclosed space. My stomach was in knots, and it's been quite a while since a horror film has made me feel that way. <br/><br/>Sadly, it loses some momentum in the second act. I felt the film started to fall apart at the beach house. Too many gaps were filled, and I felt like my imagination was no longer in play. I am of the opinion that retaining this level of mental engagement is important for the film to maintain its integrity through the developing story arc. <br/><br/>The ""final"" battle at the pool lost me entirely. It did nothing to serve the purpose of the story, and spoon fed the viewer so much information and action on something that was otherwise intensely concealed and frightening. <br/><br/>The very end shot left me hanging as well. I understood the intention, and it left room for some discussion, which I appreciated. However, I think it avoided the potential to explore the moral implications as to how this ""disease"" is passed on sexually from person to person. It rested too aggressively on the notion that your past is always looming, and that death is inevitable. <br/><br/>In general, I expected more from the story. But truly admired everything else. A lot of detail was put into the production, which elevated the experience beyond what the story was attempting to convey. <br/><br/>Overall, an excellent film - but it had a lot of potential that it reached for, but ultimately did not achieve. I look forward to more from this director. I'd like to see him hone his craft. He's aced the look and feel of his films, but now needs to work on the depth and purpose of the story he's telling."
"matthewssilverhammer","8","89","176","3 April 2015"," Will Follow You Around
","It Follows is a unique horror-movie experience. Instead of effects- heavy monsters, computer trickery, and massive amounts of gore, it relies on refreshingly old-fashioned cinematic techniques to effectively overwhelm its audience. It's a suburban teen horror film that has more in common with the likes of The Shining than with Halloween. An impressive little indie thriller that earns its shrieks and squirms in honest ways, equal parts poetic and intensely scary, It deserves to be seen. The setup of the plot is genuinely difficult to find a way out of: what if a seemingly innocent night of sexual intimacy led to a zombie like creature following you around, and the only way to rid yourself of this ominous being is to pass it on to someone else? We all know the horror trope, that having sex will lead to that characters death, but the message here is more pointed than most. More than just a simple warning about STDs, It Follows has a strangely strong anti-promiscuous sex message. It does this through relatively flat performances and almost goofily slow pacing at times, but more often through spine-chilling imagery that is the stuff of nightmares. Young director Mitchell, an alum of FSU, is definitely a guy to watch out for. His script is good, but the sights and sounds, the two physical senses used when experiencing any film, of this thing are a piece of technical perfection. Beautiful long takes and shots, perfect use of sound against silence, and a big, dissonant score that is the best in a long time help create an event that will follow you long after you leave the theatre."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","127","258","15 April 2015"," Best horror film I've seen in at least a decade
","David Robert Mitchell's It Follows is the closest I'll get to seeing the gauzy, atmospheric, John Carpenter style horror films I grew up with on the big screen. It's a high concept, low budget, absolute masterpiece of a movie that gets under your skin and freezes your blood with eerie dread in the way that few films in the genre seem to do these days. In desolate, dreamy Detroit suburbia, a young girl (the haunting Maika Monroe) is assaulted and bound by a date after sleeping with him. He informs her he has passed along a curse to her, and that she will be followed. Not ran after, not scared by something jumping out of the closet, just simply followed, slowly... Deliberately... Relentlessly, until she passes it along to someone else. From the there the movie kicks into high gear as she and her sister along with their friends, played by superb young actors, giving their roles the fully realized attention and quirky dispositions to make us care about their plight, to figure out how to save herself. Many aspects together work to make this a wonder of a film: tight, fluid pacing, a gorgeous, thumping yet dreamy synth score that ratchets up the tension and sets a beautifully ambient, and at times overbearingly ominous tone, and a genuine love of the genre and movies themselves, implemented into making this the best, scariest and most engrossing horror movie in a decade."

The films opening scenes summarise the movie perfectly and convey the central themes of the movie expertly.<br/><br/>Essentially a horror movie with a strong idea and 'conservative' message its strength lies in the realistic portrayal of teenagers, their relationships and what they think is the right thing to do faced with the horror that faces them and to an extent cannot escape."
"pppppenguin","8","48","90","2 June 2015"," What nightmares are made of...
","This is a wonderfully shot film, an extremely unsettling chiller with a haunting soundtrack and a unique narrative that provides a great vehicle to move the story along.<br/><br/>I was hooked from the opening credits right until the end, although the finale was a poor mans 'Let the Right One in' swimming pool purge. That aside, the story for me fueled several discussions. The overarching 'following' story line reminded me of some of my childhood nightmares of being continually stalked by some relentless demonic creature. Beyond that the obvious undertone of the spread of STI's as many have recounted, resonates with the passing of the curse via unprotected sex. For me, whether rightly or wrongly, the real subtext was the symbolism of having sex as the end of adolescence, innocence being lost. The following is something you become aware of with age, as you notice the passing of time. It's like death looming in the distance, you can forget about it, distract yourself, but it will keep returning. The bubble of childhood has been forever burst.<br/><br/>Many have said that this film is not a horror or not scary, perhaps on the former they have some argument (although I disagree), but regarding the latter I always base my own views on whether I would watch this one alone at night, and I certainly would not watch this one on my own."
"MattBirk","9","85","169","28 March 2015"," One of the Best Horror Movies of the Millennium!
","I just want to get this out of the way, I've been patiently waiting for It Follows since Cannes 2014 and have never been more excited for a single movie in my entire life! My expectations were through the roof, I of course had read to praise from critics all over the world saying 'It Follows is one of the best horror movies of the decade'. Which of course is very high praise (the same was said about last year's The Babadook, which I found to be true, it was also one of my favorite movies of the year), but does this year's It Follows live up to the title of being labeled one of the best horror movies of the millennium? Yes, no question about it! <br/><br/>It Follows is the embodiment of tension and anxiety that we so rarely see in movies these days. Mitchell has created a perfect atmosphere full of dread, but more importantly he is able to create a nightmare with a dreamlike quality. The camera work is what helps make this idea flourish, wide angled shots mixed with slow panning shots revealing the monster lurking in the background. It Follows gets points for being terrifyingly original and creating a new nightmare where at all times you are never truly safe.<br/><br/>And of course enough cannot be said about the general idea of sex and what it stands for. In the movie sex is used as the tool to pass to curse from one person to another. Obviously symbolizing that sex can kill (literally), but at the same time having sex is also seen as liberating (you free yourself by passing it onto another person). This is what makes It Follows so interesting, interrupting what the monster itself represents and witnessing how different people handle said curse. The females in the film handle the situation completely different from their male counterparts. The males try to pass the curse off as fast as possible and with little remorse, whereas the females seem to feel more guilty about passing it along and struggle with their new found nightmare. Without rambling on about the subtextual layer of the movie, just know that the movie is just as creepy as it sounds. <br/><br/>Outside of that, the high point of the film has to be the original score by Disasterpeace, it's one of the best horror soundtracks in decades! The music is what makes the movie tick, it plays over the vast majority of the film and it is played very loudly to help squeeze out the most tension possible from each scene. With a killer soundtrack, fantastic cinematography, and a terrifying premise, It Follows is easily worthy of being labeled a future horror classic!"

(google street view is exactly the same, if shot a year later in Oct 2014.)<br/><br/>I found an interesting article about the director's motivation to showcase his hometown in the Detroit News online article ""David Robert Mitchell brings the spooky to Detroit""<br/><br/>To me, the story is secondary to the atmospherics.

","Have you ever wished that you could bring your covers to the movie theater in an attempt to hide from your fears? No? Well you do now. It Follows is a brilliant 80's horror film that wasn't made in the 80's. The film starts by giving you a glimpse of what this ""monster"" can do to people (in a very gruesome manner mind you) as we meet our main protagonist portrayed by Maika Monroe coming off The Guest stardom as a normal everyday teen in the suburbs of Detroit. She makes some rather poor decisions and is now being stalked by a force unknown. I think what hits the hardest for the scare factor is that most of us, have at some points in our lives had the same exact type of dream about a terrifying presence stalking us to no end. The film takes many advantages of a slow moving monster by having overwhelmingly good shots hiding the monster out of sight until just the right moment which is only one of the many positives this film has. Another great idea is by placing the film in Detroit (My home town) as it leaves open for many interesting and strange environments. The only negatives with the film I see is the rules of the monster don't make total sense as there are many plot holes surrounding the monster as a whole but I passed over it seeing that you really actually don't know the rules completely and i think the director made sure of that. The talented Director David Robert Mitchell makes a distinct choice by placing the film in a unknown time frame, making you question this reality and making the film just the more unnerving. He makes the film seem like just one big dream you will never wake up from and that may be why i love it so much. To make this film as terrifying and hard hitting as possible, you must know as little as possible to get the full feel for it like I did. If you consider yourself a horror buff or a purist to the art form of horror film making you must see It Follows. A-"

","After hearing many people say how lame this movie was I dragged my husband to the movies to see it. I usually never listen to other people's reviews. I like to see things for myself and I'm glad I did this time because it honestly wasn't all that bad. It definitely wasn't the best movie ever but it wasn't the worst. Maybe I'm just a chicken but I thought the movie was pretty scary. The opening scene at the beach terrified me. The concept is pretty cool. Everyone knows the people who have sex in horror movies are going to die. It's the easiest clue. This movie brings that rule to a whole other level. You basically get the worst STI ever. This thing starts following you and kills you. It looks different every time and can be pretty scary looking. The acting was pretty good. I didn't recognize any of the actors but they whole cast did a great job. The storyline was well written. I really liked how they didn't explain why or how this started. Does it only follow you if you have sex as a teen? The guy who passed it to Jay was 21 but we don't know when he lost his virginity. Does it only follow you if you have premarital sex? What even is it? A ghost? It's completely up to the audience to figure out. The ending was a cliffhanger. I hope they make a sequel!"

","It Follows is probably one of the most creepiest movie I've seen in a long time. The movie is not all that scary as people say but it is very creepy. There are only two jump scares in the film which is something different because today most horror films have a ton of jump scares. The film is just very creepy. The acting in this film is very good but Maika Monroe steals the entire film with her acting and I believe she will be the next scream queen in horror films. Her character reminds me of Jamie Lee Curtis character from Halloween. It Follows does remind me of Halloween a little bit. The story of this film just feels new and different. Some people might like the story but some people might not like it. I really enjoyed the story because it kept me hooked and it was very interesting. Also how this film was shot looked amazing. The score for this film was totally awesome because it had an 80's feel to it. And the score kept tension and it was very creepy. I would highly recommend checking this film out if your a fan of horror films or if your interested to check out something new."
"laamsden","9","78","155","6 April 2015"," Fresh and Creepy. Left me wanting to watch it again.
","I saw this last night and I have been thinking about it ever since. The storyline is fresh. This movie presents a new kind of creature, a sort of demon-sex-curse. The rules are simple, have sex and pass it to someone else, anyone else, but if they die, then the curse comes back to stalk you again.<br/><br/>The curse is slow but persistent. No matter where you go, it will follow plodding a straight path to you. You can out run it but it never stops and the way this plays out is very creep. Only you can see it coming. It can take on any shape it wants, and no matter what happens, once you have been infected it will always be there...<br/><br/>The lead is very convincing which brings me to the next point. All of the acting is superb. The story is set around a group of teen friends who come together to support and protect the lead.

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","83","166","1 April 2015"," It Follows . . . It Succeeds
","In horror movies, it stinks to be young. Our minds and bodies are getting adjusted to so many scary things then you have to deal with some fool with a butcher knife or a ghost with a 200 year-old ax to grind. It's hard to grow up, but it's even harder when it comes in the form of outward forces that we can't explain – we get enough of that from the natural world. Kids in horror movies have gotten a raw deal ever since that chainsaw business back in the early 70s, and we the best of the genre seems to lean on this idea.<br/><br/>David Robert Mitchell's It Follows is no different, but there's a method to all the madness. They aren't just pawns, they are actual human beings forced to deal with the unexplainable. Mitchell's genius is that he creates a dark mood and tone, and the feeling that something is around every corner and emerges from a place no one can quite explain. He's a born filmmaker whose efforts here got him noticed – the film was widely praised at the Cannes film festival last year, and I'm happy to say, it was earned. Unlike most films in this genre that feel like fish food hammered together based on whatever seems popular at the moment.<br/><br/>It Follows is built on a premise that is almost fatally ridiculous but you don't mind so much because the movie is put together with breathtakingly ambitious filmmaking that evokes a sense of fear and terror even when nothing is happening. It takes it's horror from the simple but unsettling notion that even when all is peaceful and calm, someone is watching.<br/><br/>The movie opens in a quiet suburban neighborhood with the camera planted in the middle of the street. The camera swivels around to a middle-class cracker box house from which emerges a young girl who is obviously scared out of her mind – something is chasing her. In a few short moments, she gets in her car and drives away. At a shallow spot in road, she calls her father to tell him goodbye and the next morning – well, you can guess.<br/><br/>Our focus shifts to a different girl – broody young Jay Height (Maika Monroe), a pretty blonde whose 20 year-old youth ebbs between the end of budding teen years and the beginnings of the mysteries of her own sexuality. She's got a lot on her mind, and we can see in her eyes that something is going on – perhaps the terror that the kid years are ending and the real world expectations are about to begin. That's the least of her worries, especially when she accepts a date with hunky Hugh (Jake Weary), a good-looking kid who tries and fails to hide jangled nerves – he takes her to a movie but bolts when he thinks he sees someone staring at him.<br/><br/>Spoilers Ahead! Hugh's eccentricity is not enough to keep Jay from accepting a second date so they go out for a drink before she (consensually) surrenders her virtue in the back of his car. What she doesn't know is that Jay is cursed, and has passed the curse on to our heroine. That's right — the curse is sexually transmitted. But! But! But! Just wait! Before you shut down this review in a fit of jaded cynicism hear me out. What happens to Jay is not based on plot but on blistering paranoia. She sees entities, dead people who approach her at a walking pace and never seem to stop. They come in through windows, across fields, down the beach, from everywhere, at any time, at any place. Worse is that sometimes they don't come at all. At times she sees several dead people, at times she sees nothing. She never knows where they will come from or in which form they will take.<br/><br/>What makes It Follows so special is that director David Robert Mitchell has deep-fried his movie in an almost crushing atmosphere of dread. Every frame of this movie is steeped in dark tones, bare-bulb lighting and an electronic score that seems to be piped in from Mars. This is a beautifully shot, but unsettling movie to experience. Mitchell lingers on long shots, of grassy fields, parking lots, dirty houses, and long corridors. We remember little details like tin cans, a beach chair, a telephone, a blade of grass. The movie's production design is not slick but made up of filthy rooms, dingy corridors and open spaces. Much of the movie is seen through Jays eyes, and we feel her terror.<br/><br/>In many ways, It Follows reminds me of the early films of Wes Craven (particularly the first Elm Street), only this film isn't quite as plotted as Craven's work. Much of what happens once the curse is set in motion is left to the filmmaking, not the writing. Much of Jay's journey is helped along by her high school friends who take her at her word that something wicked this way comes. Mitchell keeps the viewer at arm's length and seems unwilling to hold our hand. We don't get inside Jay's head but we feel more like we're standing next to her. We're in the room with her and her friends as they hear noises outside. The friends are not standard movie types, but specific individuals who seem to exist in Jay's hemisphere as classmates who are on the verge of moving on with their post-high school lives – this is a movie very much about time and place.<br/><br/>The third act gets a little gimmicky as the kids confront the curse on a physical level. That part of the movie seems a little hokey. The movie works best when the dread is suggested rather than confronted. Still it ends on a terrifyingly reasonable note suggesting an endless vicious cycle. Life goes on and so, apparently, do the dead."
"mohancraig","9","88","177","13 April 2015"," Fantastic score
","The movie was pretty good too, it doesn't rely on a lot of ""startle takes"" where something jumps out at you from the corner of the screen when you sort of already expect it but instead uses more of a ""creep-out"" factor that kind of makes the hair on the back of your neck stick up; it was a refreshing change although I didn't jump out of my seat it was still plenty scary.<br/><br/>I mention the music because it really does set the mood for the scenes... Especially ""old maid"" which just drives home the creepiness and unstoppable nature of the thing that ""follows""; not surprisingly there were a few other people that stuck around for the credits to see who was responsible for the music. Band called Disasterpeace in case you are curious.<br/><br/>The film has pitfalls such as how the curse or whatever you call it is transferred which I think just gets silly at some point but the horrifying aspect seems to make it worthwhile, the concept of someone just walking towards you has never concerned me and this film makes you at least temporarily question if there should be cause for concern; that's good film-making.... My only question is why was it released wide in essentially every other European country and even South Korea before being released in the U.S.?<br/><br/>Are we not savvy enough to appreciate a film of this scope while the ""Furious 7"" release is being played every 30 minutes in 5 different auditoriums at the local Google-plex?... How stupid is the premise for that film and why do we still cater to morons in this country?"

It's hard to make a genuinely scary film but this failed miserably. I suppose the sound track is OK and the whole idea of the film keeps you watching because you want to find out what happens at the end.....but I was left 40mins into the film wishing for the end to hurry up! <br/><br/>I would suggest people who enjoy scares, tension, twists and edge of your seat direction should avoid this!"
"Jared_Andrews","9","9","13","5 November 2019"," Eerie, Atmospheric Style that Sticks with You Long after the Movie Ends
","Some movies ease into their stories the way you might ease into a warm bath. Others cannonball into a swimming pool. ""It Follows"" takes the latter route.<br/><br/>During the opening credits, you hear the sound of air being sucked in, like you're taking a long deep breath through pursed lips. Suddenly the sound ceases and the screen hard cuts to a serene tree-lined suburban street, lingers there for a moment, then slowly pans to an ordinary-looking house. It's a calming scene. For about 10 seconds.<br/><br/>Then a young woman crashes out the front door and bolts down the block in her high heels, as thundering music floods your ears. She's clearly running from something, but we can't see what it is (listen closely and you can hear the front door open and close after her even though we don't see anyone come outside). She loops back to her driveway, hops in her car, and zips down the road. Next, we see her at a beach, trembling in the sand with the headlights facing her. She calls her dad and tells him she's sorry and that she loves him. She senses her time is nearly up.<br/><br/>In the morning, we see her disfigured body lying on the beach with her legs bent in disturbing directions. Woah. That's when I was hooked.<br/><br/>Director David Robert Mitchell cleverly plays off the trope that sex-having horror film characters must die. The invisible something that chased the girl in the opening scene is later revealed to be a curse that is passed from one person to another through sex. Once you have sex with the ""infected"" person, the monster becomes visible to you (and remains visible even after you pass it on). It can take the form of anyone - a stranger or someone you know. Then it follows.<br/><br/>Mitchell pays homage to horror classic ""Halloween"" with scenic wide shots and a carefully developed eerie atmosphere. But make no mistake: this is a wholly original film. The music establishes the tone of ill ease throughout the film. Viewers are never made comfortable at any point because we are constantly reminded about looming doom. Mitchell sprinkles shots of a person slowly approaching from a distance, barely in focus. Is that the monster? We're never sure. We never feel safe. It's the exact horror facing each of the ""infected"" characters - they never feel safe.<br/><br/>Mitchell manages to scare us without turning to the comfortable, cliched ""boo"" scares that populate so many lame horror movies today. Aside from one or two effective jump scares, the film relies on an unrelenting buildup dread to satisfy its horror quota. It's a much more impactful approach than jump scares, which last mere seconds. The scares in this movie stick with you.<br/><br/>One of my favorite filmmaking choices in the movie is that when the protagonist, Jay (played with vulnerability and humanity by Maika Monroe) learns about the monster, she doesn't hide her situation. She convinces her friends to help her. Instead of separating the characters and letting them get picked off by the monster, Mitchell opts to show how they come together to protect their friend.<br/><br/>If the monster is meant to represent an STD or sexual assault and the shame that follows, then the message is clear: talk to your friends about it. Let them help you, because this is not something you want to face alone."

As the movie goes on, it did in fact manage to keep me engaged, so I wouldn't necessarily call it a boring movie. But as it goes on, the plot develops very slowly, with some pointless scenes, like the one at the pool. And to top it all off, the most pointless ending I have ever seen, and I've seen quite a few. Maybe it's just because I've expected too much, nevertheless, 2/10 just because it kept me engaged until the end, which was a huge disappointment. My advice to you is - do not watch it at all costs. P.S. No scares at all."

","""It Follows"" starts with a very simple and effective idea, uses perfect lighting, unique cinematography, design, and a memorable soundtrack in the suburban setting of Detroit. Twisting these elements into a nightmare that never stops, it's one of the scariest films of the last decade.<br/><br/>Think of ""it"" as a sexually transmitted infection. You might get it from someone, it might not show immediately, but when it does, it's the worst thing you've ever seen, but instead of visiting the local practitioner for a fix, the only way to say goodbye is by passing it to someone else, and like a festering infection, it's in your bloodstream and could return at any time.<br/><br/>""It follows"" uses a number of conventional horror tropes that really help amplify the terror. There are many moments where you just want to yell, ""look behind you"" and grip the edge of your seat in the hope that the characters can see what you can.<br/><br/>Water is used as a recurring motif and really gives a mysterious quality to the imagery. I feel the use of fluid substances is a warning sign and carries meaning that is much deeper than what is prevalent on the surface. Places like the beach, the pool and a lake give a sense of danger and fear of what lies beneath.<br/><br/>What is unique about this film is the amazing cinematography, very smart at times. The director of photography makes an intelligent use of constant pans, slowly building tension. There are and a number of inventive camera tricks which give this film its signature style.<br/><br/>The synthesized soundtrack along with the production design gives a retro vibe, however it's hard to figure out what era the film is set. The film uses a mash up of 80's and 90's decor but I can't help but wonder if this is the time zone the film is set, or if the kids are just poor and edgy with their outfit choices.<br/><br/>I think this film is what all horror fans have been waiting for. ""It Follows"" really creeps and crawls and is an inspiring film of our generation."
"AlukardsCastle","10","109","224","27 March 2015"," The Best Original American Horror Movie Since Insidious.
","I heard of this movie many months before its release when I google searched Horror movies coming out in 2014 at the time. This was on many lists but I never really looked into it more until finally in 2015 it was announced that it would get a very limited theater release. I saw the glowing reviews and was envious that only 4 theaters would play it. Well apparently the movie had one of the best performances in such a small theater count that it was graced with a nationwide theater release soon after. I was glad that the trailers didn't give away much of the real scares because after leaving the theater from this movie I am still shocked at some of the images depicted in the film. <br/><br/>-Plot- An attractive teenager meets a seemingly nice guy and they go on a few dates. After a bit they finally have sex. Suddenly she wakes up tied to a wheelchair by the young man. He tells her that he has passed on an entity to her through sex and that it will follow her at a walking pace until it kills her. It will take many different forms of random strangers or someone close to her. To make sure she believes him, he waits with her, still tied to the wheelchair until ""it"" comes. Then he quickly releases her and hopes for the best. <br/><br/>That's the gist of the set up of the movie. Seeing all the reviews prior, I expected a good horror movie. In actuality, this is more than good, it's fantastic. The main cast are all teenagers, which could make the premise seem less scary, but boy does it all deliver. The movie has a retro feel at points with many of the best scenes using longshots that give it a roller-coaster feeling. The music ranges from terrifyingly loud but effective to soothing but creepy synths in the style of 80s classics. The opening sequence features one of the most terrifying images I've seen on the big screen. Every scene featuring ""it"" is executed masterfully and will have you on the edge of your seat. I will admit some of the secondary characters were annoying. The girl with glasses was pointless as she tried to be meaningful as she read quotes throughout the movie yet I just found her tiring quick. There are some scenes that did drag on a bit without much to offer and ended up feeling awkward. I think that a good 5 minutes worth of footage could have been taken out of the film and it would still be great. I'm not really complaining about it though, but I know that many others will. I would go as far as to say this is the ""Drive"" of horror movies. I mean that as a compliment. This movie will leave you with a sense of terror brooding in your stomach when you see someone blankly walking in your direction. I strongly think this movie could save the horror genre as it seems to be slipping in the past few years. I would strongly suggest you to see this in theaters if you are reading this while it is still in nationwide release. If you want a good scare then I'm urging you to experience this on the big screen. This movie really earns its R rating. There is no reason whatsoever to show this movie to anyone under the age of maybe 16 even with supervision. There is a lot of nudity and strong sexual moments not to mention the opening scene that I promise you will traumatize many viewers. Just bare with the movie in its slower moments because it's worth it all in the end. If you can't make it to the theater then I suggest you view the movie at home on a night where you can really sit back and relax with few distractions. Turn the volume up. Oh and watching this with a group can be fun depending on who its with. Just don't let your guard down afterwards when walking around in public, because It follows."

","(72%) After last year's brilliant 1980's throwback Cold in July, plus the decent, yet oddly and annoyingly overrated The guest, comes this which fits somewhere in between the two of them. Although it must be said this is the best new horror I've seen since the great Babadook. First of all, and from the very start, this is an almost faultlessly well made production crafted by the young David Robert Mitchell who puts considerably more experienced film makers to shame (Wes Craven I'm looking at you). The perfectly cast Maika Monroe shines twice as much here as she did in The guest simply because this is twice as well written, while her support is given enough weight for me to be invested in the unfolding events proving that making all or most of the cast into jackasses isn't the only way to make a teen based horror (Eli Roth, take notes). On the downside, and with all that's said and done, the plot isn't anything particularly groundbreaking. But I liked how the curse itself is left largely to the audience to figure out how exactly it operates with the somewhat flawed diagnosis of certain characters only going some of the way to explain what this thing actually is, which I thought really works among these young adults with their limited assumptions and rumour based understanding of it all. If you have any fondness for 80's flavoured, John Carpenter inspired horror, or just a good horror flick that are increasingly becoming rare these days, then this is more than good enough for a look."

Now I want to say that this movie sucks. Not lying at all, I can't believe it. The movie has an awesome principle of a virus like monster but they never do anything with this principle. This movie is incredibly slow and seams to be some metaphor for kids saying ""don't have sex because it might drag your life through several days of boring footage"". Seriously there is probably 5 scenes in the movie that are interesting but last no longer than 2 minutes a piece. Every second scene is someone staring at the ground depressed or a zoomed in shot of a place you have already scene in the movie about 5 times. I might sound a bit harsh but I really don't understand what is all the rage about a reallllllllllly slow movie like this.

The music is effective and again, it is this style that really works rather than over the top loud music in horror movies. Predictability is not a factor and there is enough time spent in slowly building up atmosphere. There are scenes which are humorous as well and they are never the slapstick style.<br/><br/>The creature itself is creepy. It reminded me of the Thing to some extent. It is not the same concept of course but the fact that it could appear in any form seemed similar. The tall guy damn - that had the biggest impact in the cinema where I was watching it. The lack of too many jump scares was also refreshing. The introduction scene was also a highlight. Another thing I liked was that the movie doesn't exactly hold back and some of the scenes are disturbing, especially that scene with the mother (or It pretending to be the mother).<br/><br/>I did think the pool scene was a problem. I don't think it fits in with the rest of the movie and it doesn't make much sense. While it is well done, I think maybe the scene doesn't have an impact. Regarding the ending, maybe it could have been better. I was not so satisfied with the ending. Another thing I wondered - what about the parents? I don't remember the parents much at all.

","this isn't the scariest movie, but it's definitely a creepy and well executed horror flick. the directing and cinematography is top notch (good pacing, fluid editing, great use of wide-angles, and smooth camera movement to create tension and suspense). the soundtrack is also terrific - a blend of standard horror music cues with an 80s synth vibe. The premise is that there's an STD going around whereby when you sleep with someone, you become the target of these slow-moving (they basically just walk. it's a good thing they can't run...)supernatural beings who won't stop until they kill you. To make matters worse, these entities look like regular people and can only be seen by the people who have this curse. They look normal, but most of them are disheveled/disturbed in some way so as to appear unsettling - kudos to the costume department! So what it boils down to is, you feel as if you're being followed by these creepy stalkers, but you can't really tell if it's an actual person or something that's trying to kill you, and you're friends can't see them, so they probably think you're crazy. It's an intriguing and I think refreshingly unique premise. The director and writers do good a job not trying too hard to explain how everything works, allowing the audience to immerse themselves into the story and the dilemma these characters face. Watch this movie!"

","**Warning! Spoiler Information Inside!**<br/><br/>I had heard far and wide (meaning on various internet chat spots and blogs) that It Follows (2014) , was a decent horror flick , and after viewing twice I agree it was.<br/><br/>Jay is just an ordinary teenage girl having the ordinary teenage first time sexual encounters. She ends up being used by another high school student to pass along what seems to be an existential form of demonic STD. As the story moves along many events prove this is no fantasy.<br/><br/>So, it appears that director David Robert Mitchell had a steady diet of 80s slasher and horror flicks in his pool of influences for this film , Noting also that he penned this films script as well. There are many subtle homages to this era if the viewer looks close enough.<br/><br/>However, the real win of this movie is its scenes and sequences. I swear (or would bet heavily) that the Director of Cinematography Mike Gioulakus was a fan of Late Director Stanley Kubrick's The Shinning (1980). So much of the frames in this film hold that kind of power that the viewer can enjoy film because of it's cinematic style.<br/><br/>It also is a big plus, in the face of film flow that makes a turtle look like a marathon runner. The Plot has gimmicky and unbelievable Situations , well it is a horror film , however , the cast comes off well with no really unbelievable acting performances. As well the Pulp Fiction (1994) effect before cause film editing style is a good approach for holding interest here.<br/><br/>If you want good teen summer horror fare , this is one to see.<br/><br/>Three Stars(of 5)."

","Although I've ticked the Spoiler box, I'll attempt to keep this very light on them and other than the basic premise, I won't disclose plot points.<br/><br/>It Follows is nightmarish. The story concerns a curse which is passed from person to person through sexual intercourse. If you are the latest recipient of the curse, you will find yourself stalked by an entity which can take on the appearance of anyone. All it wants to do is get close enough to kill you.<br/><br/>The brilliant thing about the film's entity is the way it's subtly wrong. Although it always appears as a human, the humans often seem out of place in a disquieting manner. Another strength of the film is that it rigidly sticks to its simple rules and it doesn't cheat. The creature doesn't just pop up from nowhere, it can't teleport, and most disturbing of all, it never runs. It just walks. And walks. And walks. Until you're dead.<br/><br/>The only slight niggles I had with the film are that it does look a *little* cheap at times and the soundtrack - which is by Disasterpiece, the composer of the video game FEZ - does sound a little simplistic at times, and, for me, distractingly like the FEZ soundtrack. At other times the soundtrack is very effective, so your mileage may vary on that gripe."

","It Follows is like a breath of fresh air in the horror genre. First of all the premise is quite unorthodox and interesting. Secondly it provides a fine blend of psychological horror along with a few jump scares as well. The somewhat ambiguous approach of the film though may face a divided response. The horror element here is something which is referred to only as ""it"" and ""it"" follows only one target person at a time. A person becomes a target through sexual encounter with a person who is currently a target. Thus one can pass the curse of ""it"" to a person by having sex with that person. Interesting right? There isn't much light shed into the origin of ""it"" but as the film goes on we learn slowly about the functioning of ""it"" but never its origin. The ending is ambiguous and didn't work so well for me this time but considering most of the film relies on ambiguity(ie.how the audience interprets) the ending is fine.<br/><br/>It Follows is a slow burning film, so have patience and let the plot and suspense build up. The best aspect I felt was the haunting soundtrack and the strong cinematography. It totally establishes the gloomy atmosphere. The script could have revealed a bit more about ""it"" but some open ends are fine for me (might not be for all). There were many loose ends I felt. There may not be any popular faces still the acting was quite believable for an horror film.Another similar recent horror movie comes to mind is ""The Babadook"". Both of these are thought provoking Psychological horror films unlike the rehashed, unoriginal, jumpy and predictably bland horror films we are getting these days. If you liked ""The Babadook"" I suggest you don't miss this one. It has its flaws but I would appreciate it for its originality. If you were totally sucked into the film's atmosphere and story then for days you will feel like checking around if someone is following when you are alone. This low budget indie film I believe will be a cult horror classic.<br/><br/>Rating: [3.5/5]"

","Disappointed at the god awful turn the horror genre has taken since I'm not a fan of the cheap and stupid gore/possessed killer doll/possession/ghosts/documentary style trends that have been giving the genre a really bad name for a while now,I've been waiting very long to see an actual horror film that at least would be worth the price of admission. <br/><br/>So,a lot of my friends actually highly recommended this film to me and even told me that this was the best horror film in years and praised it for it's originality and even compared it to the works of some of my favorite directors like John Carpenter,David Lynch,Adrian Lyne,Herk Harvey and David Cronenberg (which I started having very high doubts about after watching the trailer),but since it was praised as being unique and original,and since I'm a big fan of independent horror films I decided to go see it not knowing I was going to make a terrible mistake by wasting my money and an hour and 40 minutes of my life I could have spent doing something worth my time.Instead of a good independent horror film,what I got was an incredibly boring steaming pile of hipster indie garbage and in no way showed any resemblance to the works of the amazing directors that this trash is being compared to,plus the plot made absolutely no sense at all and it had tons of holes in it,the source and history of the haunting is never discussed,all you know is that the guy who gives this ""ghost STD"" to the main character had it and passed it on to her,never know who gave it to him or where it came from,and after the guy knocks her out with chloroform,ties her to a chair and leaves her half naked in front of her house,still the police doesn't do anything and she doesn't press charges LOL,at some point they decide to go visit the guy and ask him who infected him,but when they get there,all they do is sit around and the guy keeps avoiding answering how he got it and all he does is repeat ""you have to pass it on to someone else"" and then the search for the source of the haunting is completely abandoned afterwards,also the film opens with some girl running from her house,then driving away to the beach,calls her parents to say she loves them and then it's morning and she's all butchered and it doesn't say who she is,where did she get the curse from and if she has any relation to any of the character,then at the end after Jay and Paul have sex,you see Paul driving in his car looking for prostitutes and then in the next scene you see Jay and Paul walking together holding hands while some guy (supposedly the evil entity) still follows them,does it mean that Paul passed the curse on to a hooker and it's still following Jay anyway because she didn't completely get rid of the curse or did Paul chicken out about screwing a hooker so it's only following him or they both passed the curse but it's still following them ?...this film was a complete mind-rape,and not in an amazing psychological horror/thriller with a great story and an awesome twist ending good mind-rape,I mean in a ""I'm completely lost,WTF did I just watch"" mind-rape.<br/><br/>I honestly don't understand the big hype this film has,and I just can't believe believe my eyes seeing how many people are calling it the best horror film in over a decade,a masterpiece and an instant classic LOL,are you kidding me???,not only it's the farthest thing from,but this is so bad that it makes pathetic,dull crap like À l'intérieur (Inside) look like Repulsion,and it has been given a totally unfair much higher rating than it actually deserves,also there's absolutely nothing scary or disturbing about this trash,not even for the easily startled,and it's neither original or unique in the least,the sexually transmitted horror has been done to death,the director just made another They Came from Within/Shivers only replacing the ""story"" with The Ring/Final Destination's story,I just don't understand why people are hailing this as some refreshing break from the slasher gorefest slashers that have been plaguing the horror genre,well,hipster indie caca with nonsense ""plots"" full of holes,idiotic teen dialogue and laughably bad acting like this are plaguing the horror genre and cinema in general just as much as the hack and slash,there's absolutely no difference,just because a film doesn't have a lot of gory scenes doesn't make it an improvement when the story is cut in half and you don't know what the hell you're watching and the scares a very weak and unoriginal,also the score is also regarded as ""haunting and original,but it's just a ripoff of almost every 80s horror film's score ever made,far from original and scary when it's been heard over a thousand times before,and the low budget is not an excuse for this,I've seen many old and new independent horror films with very low budget and they still achieved their goal perfectly,just as long as the story,acting,script,music,light and cinematography in general are solid, and the techniques and ideas are original and properly put together,that's what makes the film work regardless of it's budget.This is what marketing does,they polish a turd and make it look like it's the next Suspiria with a tempting trailer and critic reviews,and the hipsters and fools who can't tell the difference between an genuinely good horror film and a dumpster bin.<br/><br/>it's simple,if you want to see another sequel of The Ring/Final Destination franchise but with a penis and a vagina spreading the curse instead,then this is for you,others looking for

","Where can I start with this? Where is the jump-off point as not to devolve into nitpicking and a clever play on words with the title to conclude? How can I not over-analyze this one? It Follows is thoroughly disturbing and fairly well-done, but has some flaws on the more technical side of things.<br/><br/>I was excited to see this movie because the lone TV-spot I saw gave so little information, while hinting at insane scares. The description I found online just said that ""after a strange sexual encounter, a girl feels she's being stalked."" Is there really more to know before going in? No, and I recommend knowing nothing more. The trailers at the start of the movie had Insidious 3 and the Poltergeist remake and something else about a family in a house and things happen to the kid. I can't help but be bored by a trailer that lets you know all the scares in the movie will rely upon a demon hand's ability to come out of any object. Or an otherwise inanimate object moving at someone. Those movies tell us exactly what's happening. It's not scary. It Follows tells us little enough to understand what's going on, but still be creeped the hell out.<br/><br/>There's an 80's synth in the soundtrack. The era of the film is indeterminable. This movie is stylized, as more movies should be. For all the style and scare, there are some technical issues. I noticed that fades were excessively used in the editing. Sometimes even with transitional shots that weren't related to each other. The soundtrack had some awkward, sudden starts and stops, too. This is really nitpicky of me and most people won't mind, but you can't deny that it is distracting.<br/><br/>I don't scare easily with movies. My third parent was the television. I'm desensitized enough to be bored by horror. This movie didn't make me defecate or anything, but it was unsettling enough to fight off the disappointment I often expect with a movie that advertises itself as horror. It then went even further with me by having some really horrific visuals in a couple scenes.<br/><br/>Despite technical problems, It Follows is a cleverly done horror movie. If I can't see a 10/10 Oscar winner, I want to see stuff like this. They moved right along once ""It"" appears and didn't let up. 7.5/10 to this movie."

"j-madej","8","71","143","17 April 2015"," IT FOLLOWS is not your typical horror. Here the style dictates the substance.
","Whenever you hear about an independent horror movie with a very humble budget of $2 million that is being thought as the best independent horror of the year, it always gets me worried. My expectation get so big that I often get disappointed with the outcome. I had this with James Wan's ""The Conjuring"" which news from early screenings were so optimistic that the movie was pushed forward to premiere during better, more viewers friendly time of of the year. The film was OK, but far from horror masterpiece like ""INSIDIOUS"", which on the other hand was wonderfully surprisingly excellent in it's own right. Director David Robert Mitchell with his stylish scary movie ""IT FOLLOWS"" decided to bring a new twist in the horror genre. The concept of sexually transmitted haunting has never been done to my knowledge. <br/><br/>For nineteen-year-old Jay, Autumn should be about school, boys and week-ends out at the lake. But after a seemingly innocent sexual encounter, she finds herself plagued by strange visions and the inescapable sense that someone, something, is following her. Faced with this burden, Jay and her friends must find a way to escape the horrors that seem to be only a few steps behind.<br/><br/>By clearly using an inspiration from directors like Carpenter, Mitchell's vision is full of 80's electronic music with long panning shots that often are the master shots of the scenes. The camera is spinning on its axes as we always wonder if something is not hiding in the shadows, or indeed following the characters. This is where the strength of this film lays, it's suspense. And not the cheap, corny kind, but sometime borderline stylistic homage giving to filmmakers like Kubrick and his horror masterpiece ""The Shining"". There are clear moments that brings to mind this timeless classic, even things like sound design and music which is stylistically used in a very suspenseful way. Indeed perhaps this the best way to describe this film is that is suspenseful. If it is gore you are after, then this film will not be to your satisfaction, there is very little of it. Not counting the opening sequence, that is. In fact perhaps is not right to call IT FOLLOWS a horror, its more of a dark, suspense thriller. Now, that means that there are spots of frights spread around in the story but sometime in between we might feel bit disconnected from the story, though the performances are solid specially from Maika Monroe playing ""infected"" Jay Height. This film has often slow and individual passing. Very meditative with above mentioned slow panning dolly shots creates moody stylistic throwback to horrors of 60's, 70's and specially 80's. This might not be to everyone liking, I personally liked it a lot. Is this the best horror film of the year? ...not too sure about that. Is it worth checking out?... most definitely, specially if you've been looking for something suspenseful and scary. But be prepared IT FOLLOWS is not your typical horror. Here the style dictates the substance."

","I saw 'It Follows' during a sneak preview at the local theater. When they informed us that we were about to be shown a horror movie, I already prepared myself for another 'ghost, demon possession, haunted house, evil creature' type of movie, which we have seen time and time again in the last couple of years. But I couldn't have been more wrong.<br/><br/>'It Follows', the title of the movie, doesn't leave much to the imagination. There is a thing, 'It' (not the clown) that follows you once you've had a sexual encounter with the person which 'It' has followed previously. 'it' is passed on by having sex with someone. If 'It' catches up to you and gets you, you're dead. 'It' than returns to follow its previous victim until it gets back to whoever it started with. Of course we won't know what the source is, because everyone tries to pass it on as fast as possible. 'It' can take the shape of every person, whether unknown or known to the victim, alive or dead.<br/><br/>A simple plot line that makes for a unique movie that has the audience on the edge of their seats all the time. Why? Because you, like the victims in the movie, don't know who 'It' is. 'It' can be in the background of every scene, so there is a constant atmosphere of danger and a sense of 'not knowing for sure' throughout the entire movie. <br/><br/>The main characters are young adults who, like most teens, are exploring their sexuality. This is also the case for Jay, portrayed by Maika Monroe, who after a seemingly innocent adventure with her new date, catches 'It'. Suddenly sex is not fun anymore, it becomes a danger and also a necessity to survive 'it'. Now, don't think this movie is about sex or abstinence for that sake. There is casual nudity in the movie, but the overall creepiness and foreshadowing turns every scene into a nightmarish experience. Brilliant!<br/><br/>'It follows' is the best horror movie of 2015 to date, that will have you looking over your shoulder for days to come. And that's what a good horror movie should be all about."

If boredom and retardation could be combined in a perfect combination this sorry flick is the standard. Get ready to waste your time and money. Or not, if you follow my advice: avoid at all cost. I want my money back and I am sorry for each and every cent spent to support this loser project."

The plot was smart and interesting,although it had one very big mistake in my opinion. The score was brilliant.The tense and suspense were there.There are not many jump scares and the movie was still terrifying in it's own way.The thought of being constantly followed.

","Would definitely pay to see again on the big screen. If you're a horror fan, you must, must, must see this flick. Every thing about it I enjoyed- the natural look, trippy and somewhat retro synchronized score, casual pace, likable characters. It's fairly scary, too, and does not rely on JUMP-OUT-ATCHA scares, but has some creepy and exciting scenes. Just remember to suspend your disbelief and enjoy the fun vibe, reminiscent of classic horror like Halloween. As Joe Bob Briggs would say, there's not much story to get in the way of the plot. Please support original horror at the box office. You won't be disappointed."
"nedangra","1","29","53","7 June 2016"," Terrible...
","OK. Where do I begin... The visual quality is great and I give them props for that, and the idea of a chasing creeping entity was great too, but the story is completely pathetic and stupid, nonsensical. The first ""shocking"" scene is a poor representation of gore. The plot is cheap, I'm not sure who had the great idea of making an entity chase you from having sex with someone... And kill you from having sex. It takes all seriousness from the story, really.<br/><br/>Oh God, how do I get rid of it? Simple! Go have more sex, but it's temporary! There wasn't a single thing that actually gave me a scare of any sort. Some scenes were disturbing, especially some transformations of the entity, but other than that...<br/><br/>Now, a scene in particular where Jay stares at a boat with 3 guys obviously thinking about having sex with them against her will, desperately, to try and get rid of the entity and then succeeding in having sex with them. and watching her cry in her car on her way back was the worst out of everything. Was that really necessary? Sorry but no.<br/><br/>The ending... Really? Hey guys, I ran out of ideas for the plot... Let's just finish the movie like that because who cares, right? *winks* I'd have preferred to see Jay and her new boyfriend dead from how much hate I gained towards their stupidity during the movie. Nothing more to add here.<br/><br/>Basically, I'm sorry but I'd say this is a good looking movie with a plot made for a poor audience or people who basically have never watched real horror or thrilling movies in their lives. If you're looking for quality content and a good or decent story, stay away from this one; it's a cheap movie just to make some money. Total waste of time and a waste of a good idea too.<br/><br/>Was more of a comedy to me and my girl than anything else."

"squirrel_burst","10","94","195","3 April 2015"," Great throwback to 70's horror, very clever and a genuinely frightening experience
","A horror movie is like a roller coaster. It's scary, but you're having fun because you know that it's perfectly safe. The scarier it gets, the more entertaining it is because it pulls you deeper into the story until you forget entirely that you're in the theatre watching a piece of fiction. I just saw ""The Babadook"" a week ago and I didn't expect to see another great horror film in at least a year but Christmas (or is it Halloween?) has come early because ""It Follows"" is here and it's a truly frightening film. I loved it.<br/><br/>The premise is simple and yet so ingenious. After Jay (Meika Monroe) has sex with Hugh (Jake Weary), a boy she has been dating and likes quite a bit, he gives her a grave bit of news. She's now the carrier of a curse. In the distance, invisible to everyone except those who have been afflicted, is something. This thing, whatever it is, is coming for her. It doesn't move quickly, but it's relentless. It won't ever stop until Jay passes the curse onto someone else, or is dead.<br/><br/>This picture is going to be interpreted in a lot of different ways. To me, this is a story about the thing that everyone fears the most, death. You can avoid it for a while if you stay smart, you eat well and you exercise regularly... but it's still coming. It's not even as simple as just keeping an eye out for your inevitable demise and moving out of the way at the last second either because no one knows how they're going to die. No one is going to be able to keep an eye out for you (because in this instance, the monster is invisible to everyone else) and you might not know that you're about to die until it's too late.<br/><br/>A detail that you need to know about this monster is that if you're cursed, you can see it... but you don't really know what it looks like because it's a shape shifter. It can look like anyone and the only giveaway is that it's always walking in a straight line towards you. This aspect, the fact that you can see it coming is where the cinematography of this movie comes in. This movie will make you insanely paranoid because you will never know for sure if the monster is on-screen. Every time you see someone walking and they're not interacting with anyone else, you will begin to feel a creeping chill up your spine. ""Please don't let it get any closer, please, SOMEONE notice that some stranger is walking towards the camera!"" It's absolutely nerve-wracking because of the fact that it doesn't run, or wield a big butcher knife or anything like that. It just walks. The slow speed brings in an element of hope that evenly spreads the terror throughout the entire film like peanut butter on a slice of toast. It seems like it would be so easy to get away from it, or even to get rid of the curse. I mean look at it, it's so slow! The problem is that it never stops. If you start running through traffic in an attempt to get away and you get hit by a car, it's still coming at the same pace. If you try to steal a bike, you get caught by the police and then thrown in jail, that cell won't protect you because you know this thing is going to gain ground as you wait sentencing. It looks like your only hope is to pray that you figure out a way to take it down, you spot it early enough to keep moving or you damn someone else to this horrible fate to save yourself.<br/><br/>A big part of this movie is the cinematography. On the big screen, I found myself constantly looking around trying to see if the creature approaching was approaching somewhere in the distance, or hiding behind some fence or bush. But wait a second, why would I want to see it? Is it because the reassurance that I can identify it makes it less frightening? Not really because that means it's getting closer. Which one is worse then, the fact that I CAN see it, meaning that I know to run, or that I can't see it, which means that either it's only a matter of time before it arrives, or that I've failed to recognize it? There's a whole lot of atmosphere generate by the way the movie is shot, but also by the score. The music here brings me back to some of my favourite horror films. I'm talking about pictures like ""Halloween"" and ""Assault on Precinct 13"" where the score doesn't give you hints of what is about to happen or how you're supposed to feel as much as it reminds you that there is nowhere that is truly safe and that you need to pay attention because any oversight could mean a painful and gruesome death.<br/><br/>I loved the story, so simple and to-the-point while still having some fun with its premise and plenty of intelligent developments. I liked the characters because they were intelligent and had at least a theoretical chance of surviving (unlike in so many slasher films where the villain is going to win, or at least be back for the sequel for sure). I loved the music because it perfectly captured and amplified how I felt as I grasped the gravity of the situation. I can't say enough good things about the overall execution, which demonstrates that a horror movie can be more than cheap jump scares and senseless gore thrown left and right. It's the simple, memorable and chilling imagery that still haunts me right now as I type this. I found ""It Follows"" to be immensely frightening and I can't wait to watch it again.

People will want to see the movie for the naked action!!!! Well... get ready for disappointment all the way around.<br/><br/>The writers didn't bother to create any story. None. They came up with this concept and basically said ""let's try to keep this crap going for like 90+ minutes"" without bothering to explain what is going on, no reasons, no rules, no boundaries. And that's a good thing because there is no explanation for what goes on because then they'd have to make sense of it all. So why does ""it"" follow in super slow motion to make sure that victims can get away in time to infect another person to keep the story going. Well... except of course if you want to tease with a shocking scene that is enough to induce laughs (you'll know it when you see it.)<br/><br/>The only thing this movie is good for is to show young teenagers that premarital sex is bad bad bad.

","Remember the first time you saw Michael Myers spying on Jamie Lee Curtis when she was walking home from school, in the original Halloween? The simplicity of that scene; from the soundtrack to the non-use of gore, was terrifying. He was just standing there, watching her. You knew what was going to happen later, and that scene allowed your mind to run away with the possibilities of terror that would ensue. As I watched ""It Follows"", that's exactly how I felt for the majority of the film. Terrifying simplicity, with a soundtrack/score that is OUT OF THIS WORLD Excellent. I actually believe that the music during this movie contributed more than anything else. So good I've pre-ordered it on vinyl. The cast is fresh and talented, and you won't recognize the villain until it is almost too late. See it, now."
"rjsf96","10","91","189","8 March 2015"," The Defining Horror of the Twenty First Century
","In the past decade horror has become a breeding ground for cheap, lousy and poor filmmaking. It mostly comes down to sequels, prequels, remakes, rip-offs and reboots. We have been treated to vile, repulsive and downright disgusting franchises that should have been buried in the dirt a long time ago. Tedious franchises like 'Paranormal Activity' and the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' sequels. They refuse to die. Because who cares about bad reviews when the box office receipts speak volumes.<br/><br/>Alas, I am beginning to speak off topic so let me attract your attention to the latest Horror masterpiece that is, 'It Follows'. The premise itself is surprisingly original and frightening of its own accord. The lead woman, Jay is a vulnerable nineteen year old and most importantly an independent character which is refreshing for a horror film. She is like any other girl that is nearing womanhood who just wants to chill out with her friends, be popular and go out on dates with guys.<br/><br/>Jay meets up with the new guy in town, Hugh. He strikes her as a confident and caring person. They go out on several dates, but when they go out to the cinema things start to go a bit odd. Hugh tells Jay that someone is watching them, but only Hugh appears to be able to see this person. They promptly leave the cinema and proceed to make love in a car. How romantic! Jay loses focus and realises until it is too late that Hugh is about to knock her out. She wakes up; strapped to a chair by her hands and feet. Hugh points something out that is far off moving slowly towards them. Hugh then tells Jay that he has transmitted a virus onto her. This virus makes a human like being stalk you everywhere you go, until it finds and kills you. The only way to avoid this horrid fate is to pass it onto another host through sex. After this information Jay is understandably traumatised. She confesses to her close friends, yet believes that if she tells her parents they will think that she needs medical treatment.<br/><br/>What makes the villain so effective and disturbing is its simplicity with which it dispatches its many victims. We never see the true form of the follower and this approach makes it even scarier. It takes human form and can replicate the look of your best friend. Unless you have one that is constantly drooling and walking slowly I would not panic. Well this is what I thought at first and felt that Jay was in no immediate danger; as the follower stalks its victims with the same immediacy as the zombies in 'Shaun of the Dead', very slowly then. However, it never stops, never shows any mercy and never appears to have any real meaningful motive to speak of. You would believe that the villain at first glance is underdeveloped and weak, that may be the case, but for Horrors it is a godsend. We never properly see it, so what terrifies us the most is left to our imagination and instinct of fear. The fact that it never has a reason for what it does means that you cannot change its mind. It just wishes to kill you. There are several set pieces each one topping the last in terms of creativity and how they all differentiate themselves from the other. The locations may seem bland, but the everyday can make us shiver none the less, because they are places that we can identify with. We feel complacent and relaxed, what 'It Follows' makes us do, is become paralysed by fear when revisiting well known locations like, our home, school, the beach, the cinema and the local swimming pool.<br/><br/>I used to think that horrors where limited in terms of the time of day. But this one proves that daylight can in fact be more fear inducing than utter darkness. You can see everyone and everything, but the follower could be the person standing next to you or off in the far distance. Jay begins to realise that she will never be able to keep her guard down for too long if she wishes to survive. The time flies by and when the lights came on, I was as shocked as anyone in the cinema, that this masterwork of fear, art and terror was over. I wish it would never end!<br/><br/>Many other factors of 'It Follows' continue to stalk my mind and dreams. The music sounds like it was taken from the seventies and ties in with themes of danger and loss of innocence. The cinematography is low key yet still manages to look as glorious as a paint stroke from Mr Turner. Every shot is calculated and excellent. Expect the Director David Robert Mitchell to become as widely congratulated as Stanley Kubrick and Alfred Hitchcock the acclaimed masters of suspense and horror. I honestly cannot praise this film highly enough! Even the female lead that is fairly unknown, the wickedly talented Maika Monroe shows a surprising amount of skill in front of the camera. This is sure to be the film that catapults her towards stardom and fame. Monroe is ever so convincing as the petrified Jay who finds it harder to lead a normal life. Made all the worse by the follower and the fact that only its victims can see it. She outdoes herself and as an actress is sure to lead a long astonishing set of performances in her wake.<br/><br/>'It Follows' is not only the greatest horror to grace our screens in 2014. It is also the best since the original 'Alien'; suspenseful, wicked, cruel, nail biting and harsh. The film always connects us through an immense leading role from Maika Monroe. Expect David Robert Mitchell to become the next horror perfectionist."

","I loved this movie! <br/><br/>I can almost extra appreciate a horror movie that doesn't rely on overstated gore to make an impressionable scare for their audiences. Rather than all that, the movie plays on the basic human feeling of paranoia and fear itself, which to me is scarier than any amount of blood, guts, and human remains. There were several holes in the plot, but I feel like they weren't big enough to make me dislike the movie. (that probably screams volumes about me as a ""movie critic"", but so be it)<br/><br/>I don't think there was a single second where I wasn't petrified that something terrible was about to happen. I thought Maika Monroe did an amazing performance, she was very believable. I look forward to seeing more of her work. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is also noteworthy. Not only the songs themselves, but the use of dynamics was brilliant. The energy they were creating with the music and the gorgeous cinematography, I was intensely captivated. <br/><br/>I'm not even mad at the fact that this movie is just a huge allegory for STDs."

But after a seemingly innocent sexual experience she finds herself unable to shake the feeling that something is stalking her. As strange visions begin to plague her, she turns to her friends to help escape this horror - if she can.<br/><br/>It Follows was a horror movie that I've been waiting for a while now. As I'm speaking right now this movie is rated 96% on Rotten Tomatoes and critics have been calling this ""The scariest movie of all time"", says some movie magazine. The movie was getting hyped up and I wanted to see what was all the fuss about and after seeing the movie I can say that It Follows isn't the scariest movie of all time, but it's still a great horror movie with a lot to like from it (even the soundtrack).<br/><br/>The director of this movie David Robert Mitchell is unknown directed to me as I haven't seen any of his Previous movies and It Follows is basically the first movie I've seen from him and a great one. David Robert Mitchell directed the movie unsettling and beautiful at the same time adding the art house look and feel to a horror movie which made the tone of the movie creepy and haunting with a throw back of classic horror nostalgic. I will be keeping my eye out for his next movie because David did a excellent job directing and crafting a horror nostalgia, work one David Robert Mitchell.<br/><br/>I remembered seeing Maika Monroe in last year's movie The Guest and now she's in It Follows and she delivered a great and stunning performance. In my opinion I think this is the movie that she really stands out from being good to outstanding. Now this isn't a spoiler to the movie but the scene I'm about to talk about involves Maika Monroe acting and why she was brilliant in this movie and that's when she first encounters the first follower and it's a old creepy looking women that start's walking towards her and the scene itself is very terrifying, Maika Monroe looked like she was scared and confused of what's going on and to be honest that's the face I will pull if so one started following me with that creepy look on their faces. Maika Monroe was pure outstanding in this movie and I can't wait to see more of her talent in the late future.<br/><br/>The soundtrack to this movie is hands down some of the best horror soundtrack of the year, it's right up there with The Guest and other movies like Drive and Under The Skin. It's got a nostalgia of horror to it and a big tribute to John Carpenter's movies. I listened to the soundtrack more times then I excepted, that's how amazing this masterpiece of horror music should be done.<br/><br/>The movie's tone is what made the movie more effective to me as the movie doesn't have loud stupid jump scars or any cliché annoying characters to bring the movie down, no the movie allows on it's setting, it's atmosphere and the performances to make the movie effective or you like to call it frighting. Don't go into this movie expecting a popcorn horror flick with all the clichés you can check off the list in your head, the movie isn't like that has it's different then most horror movies.<br/><br/>Now for the problems: I already talked about how amazing Maika Monroe acting was in the movie but the other actors who played her friends wasn't all that good I mean if you have to compare it to Maika Monroe performance to these they didn't do so great. These a scene in the movie were one of them get's shot in the leg by accident and oh my god they reaction to getting shot was freaking dreadful and such bad acting it took me out of the movie a little bit, but luckily Maika Monroe was on screen most of the time in that scene so she pretty much saved it.<br/><br/>Don't worry I won't spoil the ending for you but let just say that the movie doesn't end on a good note, it just kind of ends just like that. It was like the season finale to The Sopranos it just ends like that and I'm there all like ""Was that it?"".<br/><br/>Overall It Follows is a great horror movie and I like how different and original it is. Is the movie over hyped? well yeah since critics are false advertising it saying it's the best thing that every happened and people are excepting to be scared out of their minds over this movie and leaving disappointed, well the movie didn't scary me but it left me thinking and it did have it's chilling and creepy moments that got under my skin a lot of times. If you haven't seen the movie yet go check it out but please don't go in thinking it's going to be scariest movie every made, just expect a good horror movie that's clever and unsettling."
"KittyKelly1976","1","104","219","13 June 2015"," Completely pathetic. Here's why...
","Hi there people,<br/><br/>This is MY personal opinion and review of this film, which may or may not upset some people (particularly Americans).<br/><br/>Let me give you a little background first - I have been watching horror films for well over 34 years, it's definitely my favorite genre - yet I do agree that the genre has become stale, stagnant and completely reliant upon cliché's in the past 10 years or so. Where did this all start? :<br/><br/>I blame Wes Craven, and the movie Scream (1996), seriously that was the first time I saw a horror movie and really started to wonder what was going on with the genre, it's film makers, and the people who were so willing to buy into it.<br/><br/>Since Scream's release back in 1996, I have not really enjoyed many ""mainstream"" horror films, and would quite realistically say that maybe 2-3 out of 60 have been bearable.<br/><br/>Now, this brings us to It Follow.<br/><br/>Let me start by pointing out my reasons for a 1 star scare:<br/><br/>1. Ridiculous characters, who seem to not want to do the obvious thing that would help themselves.<br/><br/>2. A plot which is relatively boring and pretty much just follows (no pun intended) a group of whining ""teens"" around a road trip from one place to the next.<br/><br/>3. The ""curse"" (if you will call it that) in the film is very badly researched, nothing is really explained about it's origin, or what can be truly done to defend against it.<br/><br/>4. Acting.... You cannot call it that really, it was soap-opera level at best, and I know this was a horror film, but come ON!<br/><br/>5. Predictable. This films was incredibly predictable, and remained so from the beginning and throughout. Nothing was left to the viewer's own mind, it was all spilled out for them from the beginning, and that which was not was hinted at so blatantly that a FIVE year old could have guessed it.<br/><br/>6. Very cheesy ""cash-in"" on the classic 80's vibe. The film tried to portray an 80's vibe throughout, but it came off as just looking bad. The 80's was a tremendous time for horror films (most of which were far superior to this trash), and this was not a ""throwback"" or ""nod"" to the films of that era, it was a goddamn insult. A try-hard affair.<br/><br/>Now, did I like anything about the film?<br/><br/>Not particularly - the only redeeming quality I can actually say the thing had going for it was it's score. This, however , was also over-used, but was lovely at times.<br/><br/>Summary: David Robert Mitchell - please do not direct another film , and if you do chose to - please don't do another horror. America does not need an ""80's horror film revival"", the 80's were perfectly fine without one, and you are so young you probably do not even RECALL the best of that era. Please, if you make more films (and they are indeed labeled as horror) try to come up with a style which is unique, and of it's own, something which viewers can be captivated with, which is not copied by previous masters of the genre (which you are not)."

The one thing that's just unforgivable is that there is absolutely no value addition in terms on the story from the 1st to the last sec, you can watch this one finish to start and it will feel the exact same. It's just 100 minutes of want to making it look like horror when all there is is one single line as it's story. What a movie it could have been if it's basic premise was at least a bit worked upon and a lot more evolving as it progressed. Coming to the acting part, a Lot more depth of emotions were required, the lead actress lets down the comparatively better acting supporting cast, leading to the slow pace of camera, film, and the music seem to be boring when movie making wise is not."

","It Follows is a brilliant movie. The whole idea of something constantly following you, something you can never escape that can look like anyone, someone you know, someone you don't, is a great idea for a horror movie.<br/><br/>And this movie pulls that idea off almost flawlessly.<br/><br/>The only thing I don't like about the film is that 'The It' is basically a sexually transmitted infection. When you have sex, you pass the it on to that person. It then begins to follow them. Once that person has been killed, it's believed that it goes back to the previous person and so on and so forth. The rules haven't been made fully clear though and the director states the only rules we get are what we are told in the film and are only what the character knows, therefore they could be incorrect.<br/><br/>Other than the whole having sex angle and the film obviously being a giant half metaphor for unsafe sex, it's a funny, horrific, amazing movie which shows what would be truly terrifying in real life.<br/><br/>I just love how it tries a more subtle way of scaring you instead of straight forward jump scares. Except for once, which didn't make me jump. Also how it adds depth to the characters and story, making the perfect example of what an out of place horror should be. But with an all new type of suspense and atmosphere, one I can happily say I've never experienced while watching any other film.<br/><br/>The actors are great, the writing and directing are great, and the score is beautifully haunting, reminiscent of early John Carpenter. If David Robert Mitchell sticks to the horror genre, he could easily be the next John Carpenter as it isn't only the score where the similarities exist.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to his next film and I'm pretty sure he's stated there's to be a sequel to It Follows, which I'm certain will be just as amazing as the first.<br/><br/>A well earned 9/10 <br/><br/>I wanted to begin the film again as soon as the credits began to roll."
"tjgoalie13","9","49","97","6 May 2015"," Terrifying to the Bone.
","This film is like if slender man were an STD, and it's terrifying. The reason I bring that up is many people, myself included, have been calling for a slender man film. The music helps feed the tone, and it feels like a true homage to 80's horror films (the best time for horror, no doubt.) The film has a way of always making you feel uneasy right up to the final scene, as the villain could be anybody who's walking at an average speed. This leads to everybody being a potential candidate for this creatures form. Despite undeveloped characters and a slight lack of humor the film completely delivers. Hopefully filmmakers use this and the Babadook to save the genre."
"zdh952","10","88","184","30 March 2015"," Best, most original horror movie I've seen in years
","Im going to try and give a real review of this movie and not just gush over it, but that will be difficult because I LOVE THIS DAMN MOVIE.<br/><br/>First there is the story. A girl (Jay) have a strange sexual encounter with her new fling. And soon after she finds herself stalked by IT. IT can look like anyone and IT is always walking toward you. There are ways to put distance between yourself and IT. IT only ever walks and cannot seem to move faster than a slow walk, so leaving town will by you some time, but again, IT doesn't stop following. Also you can pass this curse to someone else sexually, but once it kills the person you pass it to, it move back down the line of people who had it, including you.<br/><br/>This plot is awesome because as a HUGE fan of horror, it makes sense of the ""Sex is a sin deserving of death"" cliché thats always bugged me. There's never any logic behind sex equaling death, but here its the whole point of the film. A logical explanation for a film cliché horror fans have had to just grin and bare until now.<br/><br/>The plot, and the inevitability of being hunted down by IT is probably my favorite part of the movie. This is a classic, indy 70s style horror movie. Being a kid of the 90s, I grew up on movies that are soaked in blood and torture and movies featuring Scream-like self referentialism. This is NOT that movie. So if your a gore hound or loved the saw series, skate right by this one, it is not for you. What this movie has is wonderful atmosphere. The director has stated he used Carpenter and Romero as influences and it shows. The use of camera is brilliant, and as you learn more about IT, your find yourself looking less at the foreground and trying to watch every rustling bush and walking figure in the background, keeping an eye out for IT.<br/><br/>The attempt to make the movie feel timeless and the antiquated score were a bit distracting. Use of modern and old cars, some people have cell phones, but others choose to never use them when it makes sense, CRT tvs showing 1950's programs. Again, it adds to the 70s feel and by the end I had gotten used to it, but for the most part it was a distraction.<br/><br/>Another part that struck me was the location: Detroit!! My whole family is from the Detroit area and its surrounding suburbs, and after visiting summer after summer, its become a home away from home for me. So seeing teens (played by actual teens with actual acting ability, not 35 year old actors) walk around neighborhoods that feel like home, being chased by something that doesn't give up. That is true horror.<br/><br/>It also has interesting moral questions. Is it better to die, or do you keep hooking up with people and passing this along as a means to distance yourself from IT? THe movie doesn't dwell here very much and you're left to draw your own conclusions, but it is,again, an interesting twist on the horror cliché.<br/><br/>This movie is a good old fashion horror movie. Dripping with atmosphere, well acted, and believably told, with an ending that drives home the inevitability of being followed by IT.<br/><br/>This movie also follows you home. If someone follows me on the streets now, at a normal walking pace, I feel the urge to start jogging."

","Really? 7.3 out of ten? Maybe 25 years ago. A Very slow film with not much happening at all. Oh, they get followed by an entity in the form of a human that walks very slow. No plot to speak of, no special effects or anything to attract an audience. Watched until the end just to see how it pans out and how they get rid of it. Not too much story to give you a spoiler. As John carpenter was mentioned in a previous review I feel there are a lot of his films which are much better than this one like The Thing, The Fog, Vampires, just to mention a few.

Incredible cinematography, performances were understated in a way, but in a very good way that adds to the eerie ness of the whole film. The entire 100 minute run time had a claustrophobic feeling that makes you always wonder where ""it"" is. I can't think of a single thing I would do differently if this were my movie. 10/10.

"Sergeant_Tibbs","8","58","117","23 June 2015"," A retro allegory for the anxieties of adulthood.
","I'm not usually one for horror, but I do appreciate films that use the genre to explore interesting themes. It Follows is hardly scary. A couple disturbing scenes perhaps, but it cushions the threatened protagonist by always keeping her company with her friends. This is not a film that uses isolation to its advantage for suspense. The menace doesn't care. But how the 'it' manifests itself is irrelevant, it's a coming-of-age film using a stalking terror as an allegory for the anxieties of adulthood. Sure, it could also be about sexually transmitted diseases given its teenage cast and the method of the monster, but the beauty of It Follows is that it works for any interpretation. The former is the one that resonated with me the most, hinted in an early scene where the protagonist hangs out with who later becomes the person who gives her 'it.' There's an odd nostalgia about it, conjured by the vibrant cinematography and retro score, but Mitchell keeps it fresh. The only misstep is the misconceived third act where the characters are essentially asking for the trouble they receive but the humanistic approach Maika Monroe takes to her character saves it from feeling too removed.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Complete waste of time if your over the age of 18. This movie is propaganda aimed at teaching kids not to have sex or you'll get a STD. the movie may have people following the kids around but it clearly has an underlying message that is the whole purpose of the film, which would be fine if the movie had been marketed to bring in a young audience. I'm not going to spend my money to go see D.U.F.F. or another Bring It On movie because they clearly aren't meant for someone in their 30's. This movie was marketed as a great horror film but it wasn't great or horror, but something that should have been shown to high school kids in sex ed class.

"tdowne","10","86","180","11 April 2015"," Without all the frills...just the fears
","It Follows delves back into the horror genre to a time when subtlety and score can be more terrifying than shock and gore. There are moments when characters simply look up at the sky, watch a squirrel on a telephone wire, or view a vacant yard with nothing but the sound of the wind - a false sense of calm to bring feelings of dread. The film score is synthesized with a mix similar to Charles Bernstein (A Nightmare on Elmstreet) and Vangelis (Blade Runner), and there are nods in style to Halloween (1978) and A Nightmare on Elm street (1984). Much like his first film, The Myth of the American Sleepover, director David Robert Mitchell takes the necessary time to introduce his characters and give them depth before placing them in harms way. It is a horror film as flawless and as terrifying as it can get, without all the frills...just the fears. Highly recommended."
"murray_johnc","10","86","180","5 April 2015"," The best supernatural horror flick I've seen in 40 years
","Most critics allude to young writer/director David Robert Mitchell's gem as having ""borrowed"" from previous teen slasher movies such as Halloween etc. I beg to differ, I suspect the author marches to the beat of a very different drummer. Perhaps David Rose's 1988 ""Paperhouse"" was an influence, in the way its supernatural happenings follow a rigidly structured contextual logic? But I also wonder if the director ever read works by Dr M.R. James? I see many ideas from the late M.R. James's tales in the plot structure. ""Oh Whistle and I'll Come to You My Lad"": a terrifying ghost comes after a hapless professor through an artifact discovered in the ruins of a templars' preceptory. ""Canon Alberic's Scrap Book"" a sacristan rids himself of a malevolent demon by selling priceless manuscripts to an unsuspecting collector. ""Casting the Runes"": the victim narrowly escapes death by surreptitiously returning the runic manuscript to its perpetrator. ""A warning to the Curious"": the vindictive ghost tricks his victim into following him to his doom by imitating his two companions. Few young authors get it so right so early in their careers; Mitchell has the keen instinct to avoid all the usual plot clichés, gratuitous boo moments and silliness that have ruined 99% of those unwatchable failures of this genre. I enjoyed this movie so much, I'm almost tempted to try my hand at writing a script of my own."
"bigmystery23","10","86","180","10 March 2015"," A chilling take on 80s teen horror films
","From the moment the film opens to the last seconds, there is always a sense that something isn't right. The music is hinting at an inevitable threat, the camera is slowly panning or tracking in order to help reveal what is lurking, and the actors interactions with one another make the audience forget that at any moment ""it"" will appear. Director David Robert Mitchell does something that many horror-genre filmmakers have lost sight of: what scares people the most is their imagination. Yes, the film occasionally showcases some terrifying images, but it's the moments when everything seems fine where the fear skyrockets out of the audience. I'm not going to say that this is the scariest film I've ever seen, but when it resembles the thread of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" the tension of ""Alien,"" and the style of ""The Conjuring,"" it comes pretty close to it. It is very original, well executed, and a refreshing film for all cinephiles. But most importantly, it stays with you even after the movie ends and makes you question your actions...and your surroundings."

And boy, am I glad I chose this? This is not the typical run-of-the-mill horror movie . The best thing about the movie is its background score and the way it it was shot using wide angled lenses which makes it look expansive and visually stunning. Also, there is a bit of dark humour which I personally love. The performances by the cast were terrific for a horror movie and also full marks for the execution of the movie. The premise sounds very cheesy and B-Grade'ish' but the movie was very well directed. Overall, this was a fun movie and I had a blast watching it.

","I'm normally, like many people I suspect, underwhelmed by films that get a lot of hype. And I'm glad to say, not this time. Was meaning to watch it for weeks, and it did not disappoint.<br/><br/>These are exciting times for independent films. Last year I was blown away by Blue Ruin and The Guest, and now this one. In the latter two, it very likely has something to do with the fact that the film makers are clearly inspired by the awesomeness of John Carpenter's Golden Age.<br/><br/>Score: Brilliant and effective.<br/><br/>Photography: Great overall. Some shots I didn't quite understand and found slightly amateurish, others, including the now notorious opening shot, are inspired.<br/><br/>Acting: Solid enough. Really liking in particular the new girl on the block: Maika Monroe. Very convincing, and beautiful though not in the conventional Hollywood way.<br/><br/>You can feel that the film comes from the heart, and it's apparently inspired by a real nightmare. It really comes across, and effectively captures a dream-like atmosphere.<br/><br/>What's also very original is the concept that you can, in theory, physically avoid ""it"" for the rest of your life. As we see several times, the infected can just circle around it while thinking about his or her next exit. But it's about the mental persecution that comes with this thing just walking after you non-stop, and at what point do you break down and give up? Very cool and creepy, without using cliché, massive amounts of gore or cheap shots."

","It Follows was absolutely awful. This movie is one part The Ring (mind you, not a good part) and one part slow walking 1980s killer with a poor excuse for the characters to have very boring sex slapped on. The best part of the movie was when I left to use the restroom. The restroom was clean and I didn't feel rushed because I knew I wasn't missing anything. Wait that's not fair, there was a preview for Avengers: Age of Ultron before the movie. That looked pretty good. <br/><br/>After I watched this horribly boring movie, I warned everyone in line to buy tickets to watch something else. Then I texted everyone I know not to warn them not to waste their time. Then I posted a Facebook status. Now I've made an IMDb account to continue my public service announcement.

"LloydBayer","8","56","113","13 May 2015"," Nerve wrecking and unpredictable, It Follows is a highly effective Indie horror film that should become a cult classic.
","What constitutes true cinematic horror? Is it really blood, gore and jump scares, or grotesque monsters and malevolent spirits? How about an unfathomable fear of the unknown? Built on the chassis of 70s and 80s horror classics, It Follows is such a visceral horror film that it instantly redefines the very rules of the genre. And by doing so, it reaches its destination very early and refuses to budge, where needless to say, the destination is none other than a thin layer under your skin!<br/><br/>If by now you have noticed my frequent use of the word 'It', I can tell that this film is really going to make your skin crawl. You see, writer-director David Robert Mitchell's story is based on a classic horror template of cause and effect, where the consequence is certain death. But unlike previous horror films where characters must outrun a monster or vengeful ghost just to stay alive, Mitchell's fright mechanism is intensely creepier than scare tactics used in a variety of modern horror films. Using the intimidating chain-letter as a theoretical setup, Mitchell's premise is a hex that manifests into a life threatening situation after a sexual encounter. Jay (Maika Monroe from last year's sleeper hit, The Guest), is the latest 'victim' to have received a sexually transmitted curse after a night out with Hugh (Jake Weary). Left dazed and confused, all Jay knows (or is allowed to know), is that unless she sleeps with another person (and thus pass on the curse), she will be relentlessly hunted and ultimately killed by the titular ""It"".<br/><br/>Starting with the intentionally obscure but highly suggestive title, Mitchell's genius is in never revealing what 'It' really is. Is 'It' extraterrestrial or paranormal? We don't know for sure and neither does Jay or her teenage friends who come to her rescue. Why, how and from where are other questions that are left unanswered, inflicting more panic when we see 'It' approaching in human form. Speaking of which, only the victim and the audience can see the approach, which most of the time starts as a blurry figure on either corner of the screen. But Mitchell doesn't stop there. The entire film has a retro look and feel, and if it were not for one character's hand-held device, viewers could be mistaken into thinking this film was set in the late 1960s. Using this setting and significantly adding to the mounting tension is an electronic soundtrack that is as unforgivable as cinematographer Mike Gioulakis' panning and zooming, further wreaking havoc on the viewer's nerves. It works by manifesting an unnerving sense of claustrophobia when there's everywhere to run but nowhere to hide.<br/><br/>As an original and highly effective indie horror film, It Follows bucks the trend in cheap clichés with stellar technical achievements, the slow build-up of mood and a terrifying atmosphere throughout. Then there's ample pause for thought on a metaphorical layer mask that you don't see at first. In context, it's like a painful or embarrassing shard of memory you've kept locked away since those turbulent adolescent years. And even if you come out with nerves intact, you still have to deal with those sexual skeletons you may have been harboring in the closet. It Follows may not be the best film of the year, but it's definitely a horror fan's dream come true. For the true horror connoisseur, perhaps even a bed-wetting nightmare!"
"stephendaxter","8","56","113","7 May 2015"," This is the stuff of nightmares
","It is indie horror films like 'It Follows' that are the reason why i still have much faith in future of the horror genre. Whenever a film like this comes out where it manages to scare you from start to finish without using jump scares and other modern horror movie clichés i get really excited. This film utilised amazing camera techniques and sounds that alone just absolutely scare the crap out of you just like old, classic horror films used to. I found myself constantly trying to hide from the screen because the imagery was just so damn terrifying. Much of the film uses the idea that someone might be following you at all times to get you to always be in fear no matter what is happening. As well as being a device to scare the living daylights out of you it really helps to keep the story moving and adds to some pretty major plot points. Also there are scenes where this mysterious thing actually shows up and that is just the stuff of nightmares. I felt like a little kid looking up and getting the life scared out of me by anything that looked even remotely weird. In terms of the plot, the film does well to stay away from 95% of predictable moments and that really helps in a horror film so you don't have much time to brace for a huge scary moment (not a jump scare). <br/><br/>In terms of performances, i thought they were pretty good all round, with the standout being Maika Monroe who i also remember did a great job in The Guest last year. You always bought into her actions and the way she reacted to certain events which made the film a lot more believable. Where the film let me down was towards the end. The ending sequence of the movie was still pretty damn terrifying but not as terrifying as the rest of the movie, it felt a little cheesy or messy and i was just taken out of the film for a little over 10 minutes. Not only did the ending sequence disappoint me but the very very end didn't work for me, there are quite a few films that do this and sometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn't and this time it didn't. So despite a disappointing ending, this directorial debut for David Robert Mitchell will keep you up for days with endless nightmares. - 8.1"

","While mainstream American Horror continues to disappoint in many of the same ways it has been for decades, the last couple of years we have begun to see what looks like a promising new wave of Horror directors emerging from the New Zealand, Australian, UK and American Indie Movements. Adam Wingard (You're Next, The Guest) and Gerard Johnstone (Housebound) have put their knowledge of modern horror to use, creating genre-inverting horror comedies that manage the tricky task of being funny without diminishing the scares. Even more promising is the work of Jennifer Kent (The Babadook) and Ben Wheatley (Kill List, A Field in England) who draw on the history of film to move the medium forward. Both groups are similar in that they are film literate but the distinction of where they are pulling references from is important. We have seen a few films in the first group enter the mainstream consciousness (Scream, Cabin in the Woods) but none that I can think of from the latter (maybe studio's think they are doing this by remaking classic horrors?). It Follows, the sophomore effort from writer/director David Robert Mitchell falls decidedly in the latter group. Harking back to the films of John Carpenter without feeling derivative, It Follows is a statement of how far Horror has come, and the promising future it might have. <br/><br/>It Follows is not a film which contains any major plot twists or surprises, however, it is impossible to talk about the film without in some sense spoiling it. My quick review is that this is a great film and one not to be missed. For those of you who like to go into a film fresh, stop here and go watch the film, and then read my review.<br/><br/>Maika Monroe (The Guest) plays Jay, a long legged blond from the suburbs, who, after sleeping for the first time with her seemingly nice boyfriend, is drugged and passes out. She wakes us tied to a wheelchair where a frightened Hugh (her boyfriend) informers her that she will now be followed by something. He doesn't know what it is but he knows it will follow her, never faster than walking speed. He got it by having sex with a girl who had it, and now he has passed it on to her. ""It could look like someone you know or it could be a stranger in a crowd. Whatever helps it get close to you."" You can travel to buy yourself sometime, but it will always be slowly following. He advocates passing it on to someone new, which will be easy, he reminds her, because she is a girl. <br/><br/>There has been a fair amount of conversation regarding what It Follows is actually about. Clearly it is commenting on sex, and because of the nature of the curse, many have been quick to conclude it is a film about STD's. While a Cronenbergian reading is interesting, I think this is ultimately wrong. This reading doesn't even work plot wise; what STD is cured by having sex with a new victim? Viewing the film as an STD metaphor is also to ignore the multitude of ways sex is explored in the film. Sex is not just seen as a potentially dangerous activity, it is also portrayed as a weapon, as comfort when afraid and as a way to express one's inner feelings. While I can't claim to know exactly what It Follows is about, I do not think it can be reduced to just one thing. The film explores a complexity of ideas, many of them not reducible to a single over-arching reading. <br/><br/>Putting aside the high-concept plot of the film, It Follows works incredibly well on a surface-level viewing. The film will suck you into its dreamlike reality and make you care about its sympathetic and well- rounded characters. It Follows moves at a relatively easy pace, but the haunting atmosphere and pounding electronic score will leave you twitching in fear and anticipation. The dread of the unstoppable and unrelenting force pursuing them is never lost on the audience. Rather than settling for cheap scares, the film creates a building tension which it maintains for almost the entirety of the running time. Rarely is there time to breath, this is not a film for those who like their horror films at an ironic distance. It Follows is remarkably terrifying, a horror that will follow you home and leave you shaken for days."
"aharmas","10","76","158","6 April 2015"," Who is it?
","It's refreshing to see a film where your brain is required to do a little thinking, well, maybe more than a little thinking. A young woman is haunted by an entity that might end up killing her if she doesn't get rid of it. We know the basics of what this entity is and what it could do? There are hints throughout the film that there might be more to it than just being another scary creation.<br/><br/>Some people might think it stands for the effects and consequences of actions, especially when those involve violence or sex. It's obvious from what we are allowed to see that this how it's transmitted. Later, we discover that maybe the young man who explains whatever little knowledge he has, that this is not accurate. As we see that the entity just doesn't disappear as indicated. Also, it appears that it's not only haunting Jay, but it's felt by the people around her. This is where we begin to wonder.<br/><br/>There are what some people might refer to as inconsistencies in the film, but I think they're purposefully placed there by the film's writer/director. There are homes and cars that would be better placed in an 80's location. There you have b/w TV sets all over the place, the dark brown and green sofas, and nothing that could bring you back to contemporary times, except for a clam ""e-reader""? Some of the clothes are a bit anachronistic, too, but we never know when we are dealing with a retro crowd. Then we see modern cars, cell-phones (in the first scene), and a very depressed bunch of people and surroundings.<br/><br/>The way the film is directed we have a minimum intervention by adults. We see a profile here and there, or if we're lucky, a voice outside the screen. Then, there's the haunting soundtrack and the expert editing which takes you from one mood to another, back and forth, and keeps you thinking about what's going on because there is much to wonder about.<br/><br/>The body count is not big, and if we pay attention there seems to a direct relationship between the entity and its victim, all very disturbing. We also have photos, cleverly placed to maybe provide clues as to what could be happening. Are we dealing with the results of action in the distant past? Are these souls in limbo? There seems to be a disconnect between the people who are closely affected by the entity and the rest of the neighborhood. It is as if they're not visible to them, but they are able to see reminders of what happened there. Much emphasis is placed on the decayed surroundings, abandoned buildings, hopeless attitude of some of the principal characters. In addition, we hear plenty of reminiscing between one of the couples. For a moment, I thought we were dealing with ""The Sixth Sense"" universe, and to be prepared for a last minute revelation. However, there's the abrupt ending, but it's really that way? Or is it maybe just the end... of a cycle?<br/><br/>Whatever the situation might be, the mood is right, the acting is very good, as the film reveals just enough to keep the mystery going, and the challenge alive. It's good to see that cinema can still entertain you, thrill you, and keep you engaged."

","There was a considerable amount of hype surrounding this movie after its limited releases, which gradually snared my attention. There was only one problem...I couldn't find it anywhere! Screenings of this film were few and far between so my excitement for it started to build and build. When I finally saw it, I was not let down, but then again, it was nothing more than I expected. The film is good fun with an interesting premise, a skilled bunch of actors, and a few intense, creepy, and creative scenes. The main cast was picked well and delivered believable performances, at least for a modern horror film. Horror films these days seem to contain mainly cardboard cut- out characters with an uninteresting story and generic jump scares. It Follows' scares are few and far between but are used well and timed just right. The style of the film is very noticeably 70's/80's horror, which is a nice throwback, what, with the long, uninterrupted shots and screeching, haunting soundtrack. One of my favourite things about the film is the main antagonist itself. The follower. Thanks to great make-up and disturbing presentation, each variation of the follower is just as startling and frightening as the last. Overall, It Follows succeeds to be a unique, unsettling, and entertaining film which was worth the wait for me."

","During the commercials that were shown before the film began, I was heavily reminded of the problem with horror movies today. There were two trailers shown in the cinema, one for the new Poltergeist movie and the other one was for Insidious III. This was such a heavy reminder, we never see original horror movies these days, only remakes and sequels. What happened with the genre? I was a big fan of horror flicks back in the day, but then I watched too many bad ones.<br/><br/>It Follows is something very special. What begins as a normal teen horror film turns into a suspenseful, scary and GOOD movie. Yes, I said good movie. In fact, this is the best horror film in years. Almost everything is good about it. I don't know how to describe the movie without giving too much away, so let me put this simple.<br/><br/>It Follows ""follows"" a young and cute high school girl who is followed by an unknown supernatural force after getting involved in a sexual encounter. That's it, I won't give out any more plot details, because this is an experience that can easily be ruined by probably just watching the trailer and that's why I chose not to do it, although I was VERY excited for this to come out.<br/><br/>The movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time, even during slow paced scenes there not much happened. Because the movie always felt so haunting. Director David Robert Mitchell took a different turn on the horror genre, and instead of just adding random jump scares he builds up an EXTREME tension. Teenagers are usually bad actors in movies like these, since all they do for most part is having sex, partying and then they are killed off quickly. While It Follows may seem like a sex horror film, there are actually only like three short sex scenes, and they're NOT graphic at all.<br/><br/>There's some nudity, we see the main character topless quite a lot, but that's for good reasons only. I really hope It Follows makes a big profit so that the director can make another film. Go see this movie in theaters! It's a haunting experience that is worth the price of the ticket.<br/><br/>I'm giving It Follows a 8/10, and this is the first time I ever give a horror movie that score. I know around five good horror movies, and It Follows is one of them."

","I admit when I heard the premise about the plot I was certainly thinking ""great another horrible small budget horror flick"". Though something about the previews kept telling me I may be wrong. I was with my girlfriend looking for a movie to see at the theater, we like to read up on our IMDb and Fandango info before we commit to anything. We decided this looked better than Furious 7(we have seen 1-6) and the other unimpressive roster at our local cinema a few weeks ago.<br/><br/>Enter, It Follows. ***Spoilers Follow as well*** We get some snacks, sit in the theater, and after some previews we both notice that immediately there is a formula for success. The opening scene is one of frantic confusion, but not by the viewer, by the girl on the screen who's name and situation are not explained but she seems in a genuine panic to get away from something. Eventually she drives out to the middle of nowhere, and seems content with waiting for whatever she feared and looking toward the direction she just drove from. Not sure what exactly to expect, I popped open my snacks, and looks over to my girlfriend and shrugged. She was not looking back, she was following the action with wide eyes. I won't ruin the end of that scene, but suffice to say it is worth watching to find out.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses you meet another young girl, most of this focusing on high school teenagers, but not the vein stereotypes we are used to in this type of movie. These characters seem like your friends, they seem like they are real people who make real decisions, based on real circumstances. It would not ruin the movie for me to tell you that something is following them based on a sexual encounter that basically passes it along like a virus. What it is I will not explain, but it does not stop until it gets what it wants. it cannot be reasoned with, and it is not considerate of how they feel about it. Unlike a slasher film, this tension here isn't about a ruthless murderer, it's about knowing that eventually you will have to pay up and nothing will stop it from happening.<br/><br/>This movie really impressed me, it is a little predictable but not to the point of being miserable, the plot majority is relatively easy to see coming, but the smaller intricate turns make it really enjoyable. The 70's style filming and booming soundtrack reminds me of watching The Shining or some other unorthodox fright from decades past. The circumstances can change for what it wants, or whom, which makes it not such a straight path you get tired of. The length of the movie isn't so short it's annoying, but isn't so long you feel like it should have ended already. The acting, sound, length, and overall idea is very well executed and believable.<br/><br/>It Follows, It Delivers."

","With its ambiguous title, 'It Follows' extrapolates the two main function of a teenage horror film: sex and violence. Whilst (apart from the opening scene) the gore count is very low, and the low number of jump scares are done ironically or comically, as if to taunt modern horror, the pure dread the movie places in it's audience is tangible.<br/><br/>The movie starts off very distinctively, showing the audience that sex drives this whole film: whether it be the allegory of the cure as an STD,or whether it be a motivation of the characters (Keir Gilchrist does an excellent role in portraying how sex motivates him). The lack of adults accentuates this theme. Once the horror starts the premise grips you: imagine 'The Ring' but with sex - you are followed by a human (usually in a position of nudity - a link to the theme of sex), and the only way to get rid of this curse is to sleep with someone else. <br/><br/>The movie progress from realistic (Maika Monroe portraying the true fear at this curse) and falls into more generic horror tropes. The ways the curse demonstrates itself and acts is terrifying at first, but as the film tries to make it more scary I could take it less seriously. After spending the majority of the film fleeing, naturally there is some conflict, and not going into spoilers, it is an extremely poor scene. The ambiguous ending also felt like it was just for a sequel, and did not leave me shocked or thinking.<br/><br/>The cinematography and sound are outstanding, and I feel they make this film stand out against the 'paranormal activities' of modern cinema. Long shots and strange angles, sound effects that appear in the apparent wrong place, which adds to your uncertainty. Hats off to how well this film was made.<br/><br/>Overall, this interesting concept becomes more generic as it goes along, but it does borrow from the best horror has to offer. The design of the film is even better, and that is why it has set a new benchmark. The concept I'm sure will produce a sequel, but to be honest, I'm not to excited about the lore of this universe. <br/><br/>Note: I'm 16 years old and although the film scared me at the time, I would not be worried about children going as it most likely will not have a lasting effect - the director aimed for a more 'beautiful horror' with this flick."

","Remember that creepy old guy in the black hat from that Poltergeist sequel? Imagine those scenes but with the relentless unstoppable menace of the Terminator, played out in a strange dreamy 80s atmosphere with John Carpenter style music. That's a pretty accurate description of It Follows. <br/><br/>Its unique enough to be interesting, and definitely scary enough to be memorable and talked about. Is it good enough to be great? I'm not so sure - I kept thinking of all the interesting avenues the story could have gone down, but it seemed reticent to really explore its own idea. Even the most obvious idea of a long, decent chase/following scene was missing. In place of more plot development, we get lots of long takes and panning shots to build the sense of menace and intrigue. Its creepy, but after a while I felt like I had adapted a little too well to the style and would have preferred more substance instead. There are to few genuinely scary moments when there could have been far, far more. <br/><br/>I still respect the idea and the effort - and do love the movie - for me its just one of those films where I really wanted it to be great, to do justice to the strong idea."
"leon-smoothy","8","54","109","7 May 2015"," Best new take on genre since Japanese Ringu movie...
","Yes, it's true, it IS as good as most say it is...<br/><br/>It borrows more than a little from the original Japanese Ringu series, and builds on that base, but introduces some new refreshing things in the process. It's kinda like ""one step back, two steps forward"" for American horror movies, in that way that it goes back to the 70's horror movies, involving teenagers, the tingling feel of the world being new and exciting (dating and sex in particular), and all the worries that comes with that too.<br/><br/>It is different in the way that the moments in between the horror scenes is not just a transport lane with sex scenes, drugs and bad acting, it actually feels like a well made take on teen life, good trade craft in camera-work and acting, and not just another ""teen horror movie"". Those components sure exists (not the bad acting), but the feel of it is genuine, quality.<br/><br/>I have to admit I was skeptical reading about it, thinking it was just another one of those bad horror movies which we are bombarded with. Someone has actually thought this one through, and made a new take on it, keeping the ""old feel"" of 70-80's films and built something quite new.<br/><br/>It has some very unnerving and disturbing moments, that's what horror is all about, and will keep you interested and on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>I have to mention the great soundtrack as well, with a quite different feel to it, introducing a composer who's greatest work so far was making the music for an old school independent computer game released in 2013, also flirting with the 80's video game generation, very nice!<br/><br/>It should be as entertaining for the young crowd as well as more seasoned horror fans, so do yourself a favor and see this one, you won't want to miss it!<br/><br/>One of the best films of its kind in maybe 15 years or so!"

","How in God's name has this film received so many positive reviews? Did I even endure the same painful mess as everyone else or has there been more than one release of this absolute turd of a film?<br/><br/>It begins with the camera following a girl who can't quite make up her mind where in her street she'd like to run to in her eight-inch heels and skimpy nightwear. In the end she can't decide, so feels the need to drive to a beach so that she can have a heartfelt conversation with her father about how deeply sorry she is for her atrocious acting, and she acknowledges that she deserves never to work in acting again before meeting a gruesome demise.<br/><br/>I deeply cared about this character at this point, and the death had a huge impact on me, which will doubtlessly haunt me to my own dying day.<br/><br/>We're then introduced to the main character, whose name utterly escapes me, and shall be remembered as Little Miss Insipid. After a few minutes of similarly in-depth character development whereby we learn she like squirrels, wonders whether ants can swim (they can't), and enjoys swimming in grubby outdoor pools, she's quickly given the Ghostbusters equivalent of a nasty case of crabs and is sent on her merry way to either infect someone else or die a gruesome death of her own.<br/><br/>And that, dear reader, is about as much as you need to know, because that, dear reader, is where your brain will turn to sludge and start to drip out of your ears whilst you try to watch the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, though. Perhaps watching a very slow, usually half- naked, tit-hanging-out, pissing-herself ghost slowly wander up to someone with as much menace of a fluffy duckling and at the speed of an arthritic tortoise is your idea of the perfect film.<br/><br/>It isn't mine.<br/><br/>Call me crazy but I like a scary film to be, well, let's push the boat out and say scary. I know, I know, it's a lot to ask.<br/><br/>This film is boring, pointless, poorly-acted, veers from unnecessarily loud to unnecessarily quiet (and no, not for effect, it's just irritating) and is genuinely without doubt one of the worst films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>And if you do go to see it, and halfway through you resist the urge to get up and leave because you think it'll get better: get up and leave. Because it just goes off at the end, without any explanation or reasoning, and leaves you desperately wishing you'd gone with your gut instinct and left at least an hour beforehand.<br/><br/>Avoid like the clap.

I can't began to describe the feeling of foreboding that this film repeatedly raped me with during almost every scene. Several times, I found myself on the edge of my seat even before there was real reason to do so. But accompanying this feeling of foreboding was a depression that I was unable to rid myself of. And never before has any cheaply budgeted, independent horror film done such a thing to me.<br/><br/>This horror film gave me more goosebumps than actual frights....which was somehow worse. Even though the plot explains itself early on in the film (which should have spoiled it), it still could not stop the chill that kept surging through me with each predictable scene. I knew what was coming long before I even saw it, and knew which character it was coming for. And already knowing still offered me little comfort. Being prepared for what is already self-evident means nothing with this horror film. All that mattered was the POV of the character in peril...this is all we were allowed to see...which was more than enough to pleasantly chill.<br/><br/>Anyone who thinks this horror film is tame, I won't argue with you. It's not big-budget Hollywood. This was a good idea made with a small budget. And it worked...for me anyways. Which is a rare happening for myself.<br/><br/>I give it a 9/10"

"ericrnolan","9","44","87","7 May 2015"," ""It Follows."" (It's great!!)
","(WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS FOR ""IT FOLLOWS"" (2014).)<br/><br/>A smaller budget doesn't hurt this great indie horror film; I'd give ""It Follows"" a 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>It's smart, surreal, creepy and atmospheric, and it's beautifully shot. Maybe it has some similarities with ""The Ring"" series, and also the little known excellent horror film, ""From Within"" (2008), but it's still darkly creative and original.<br/><br/>It's damn scary too — it's terrific what this film accomplished with what looks like minimal CGI. For some reason, a certain shot of a rooftop really got under my skin. So, too, did a sequence depicting friends unable to warn a major character, because they're unable to see ""It"" approach.<br/><br/>I have always had a weird thing about dopplegangers. Other people hate clowns; I get creeped out by shapeshifters. I'm frightened by any monster that can masquerade as allies or loved ones. It's part of the reason that the Alien Bounty Hunter worked so well for me as an antagonist on ""The X Files"" (1993), and why the T-1000 scared me in ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" (1991). Even Mystique, ""The X-Men"" franchise's anti-hero, could be a little unsettling every once in a while. (An attack on Wolverine BY Wolverine? Leaving his confused teammates unable to help? That's a little creepy.)<br/><br/>There are a bunch of themes served up by ""It Follows"" that you could walk away discussing with your friends; online critics are quick to point out sexually transmitted disease. (A little on the nose, don't you think?) They also pointed out mortality — this was something that I actually missed, despite the fact that it was helpfully hinted at by one character who periodically reads Dostoyevsky aloud.<br/><br/>I personally thought the film tapped into a bunch of sexual taboos and anxieties — especially incest. Consider the conversation about one character kissing a sibling, a face we see in a framed photograph toward the end, and the way ""It"" attacks another major character. I also saw victimization — as with ""The Ring,"" the victims of the monster here are presented with a tremendous moral quandary about how they might save themselves or at least forestall an attack.<br/><br/>Is water a motif? Much screen time is devoted to characters entering pools or the ocean; one person also begs for water during an attack.<br/><br/>And what about wealth? Much seems to be suggested by characters traveling from an affluent neighborhood to a poor one. And all those sweeping shots (and excellent long tracking shots) of the protagonists' beautiful neighborhood really stayed with me. I kept thinking about how much I'd like to live there.<br/><br/>I'd love to know more about the origin and modus operandi of ""It."" There is a sequel planned, according to Wikipedia; that's one of its possible plots.<br/><br/>This is a terrific scary movie! Watch it tonight!"

","'It Follows' was a nice change from the usual tripe we are being spoon fed by Hollywood at the moment, well certainly in this genre anyway. Just being different was enough to make me watch it in the theatre however just because it's different doesn't mean it's amazing.<br/><br/>The film seems to be set in an alternative universe to our own. The world building was probably one of the best things about this movie yet we learn only from observation as nothing is explained to the audience through clumsy exposition, news broadcasts, news papers etc. Its definitely got a late 70s early 80s feel to the movie but with technology hints such as a touch sensitive eReader device with dual screens, modern looking cars in the background, 1 mobile phone seen once and even fizz drinks cans had the modern ring pull. Everything else is dated technology by our standards.<br/><br/>I had no real problems with the characters, everyone done a pretty good job with their support roles but aside from our main characters Jay, Paul and Greg there's not a lot of character development really but my real issue was with the demon/ghost. I felt it was given a very ambiguous power set and lack of back story. The demon walks you down, literally rapes the life out of the victim mangles the body and will do this in public it seems yet the fact that it must have killed publicly before never seems to be reported or talked about even as rumour or folk tales. It's also a little inconsistent with how long it takes for it to catch up with our protagonist victim, surly after the car crash she would have been caught? Why was the demon standing on the roof of her house when it had already demonstrated that it could use doors or smash it's way into buildings? What happened in the pool? It seems our ghost likes to do things for dramatic effect rather than be effective at what it's supposed to do.<br/><br/>Aside from the director just expecting the audience to 'just go along with it' and not ask any questions about time, distance, where, how and why, the film keeps you interested. I was looking forward to seeing how the movie would finish. I might have missed something but I didn't fully understand the final encounter plan.<br/><br/>BRILLIANT film score, interesting hook, visually gorgeous and genuinely unique. I'd say go see it. <br/><br/>I personally had issues with the film but the great thing about opinions is you have them also so go watch the movie yourself and make up your own mind on it.<br/><br/>DON'T HAVE CASUAL SEX!"

","It Follows was a different horror movie with unique experience and one of its kind. The movie had limited release in US and was distributed by first time studio Radius-TWC.

The movement of the film is slow and it takes time to build upon of each character. David succeeds in pumping up the adrenalin with what-will-happen-next surprise coupled with perfect background score and brilliant camera work. The screenplay is crispy but does falter in the 2nd half. The abrupt ending might sway away few audience. Also, it could have been explained what exactly is following and how it began ( may be they will come up with a prequel later). Nevertheless, the applauding camera work , haunting and yet tuneful background music by Rich Vreeland are icing on the cake. The story is definitely interesting with few spooky moments though not very scary but will hold your attention. Performances by new comers are worth-mentioning especially Maika Monroe.<br/><br/>This one is sure going to be loved by ones who crave for a good horror movie.

","'IT FOLLOWS': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Critically acclaimed indie horror flick about a young woman who's constantly followed by a mysterious unknown entity, which is trying to kill her. It was written and directed by David Robert Mitchell and filmed on a budget of just $2 million. The film stars Maika Monroe, Keir Gilchrist, Lili Sepe, Daniel Zovatto, Jake Weary and Olivia Luccardi. It's a classic horror film, in every way, and it definitely lives up to all of it's hype!<br/><br/>Jay (Monroe) is a nineteen-year-old college student with a crush on a 21-year-old guy, named Hugh (Weary), she just met. The two go out on a couple of dates and then have sex together, in Hugh's car. Hugh then knocks her out, with chloroform. When Jay wakes up, Hugh informs her that he's transferred a curse to her, by sleeping with her, and she'll now be followed by a mysterious unknown force, that will constantly try to kill her. He explains that the only way she can get rid of the curse is to sleep with someone else, as he did with her. Jay spends the rest of the film frantically trying to elude the deadly entity, that's now following her, with the help of her friends.<br/><br/>The film appears to be set in the 70s or 80s, most of the time, but the characters also use cell phones and other modern devices, at other times. Still it has that classic 70s, or 80s, horror movie feel to it; and the timelessness of the film's setting is part of it's magical charm (Monroe also starred in the retro 80's action flick 'THE GUEST', just last year). The score, by the electronic musician known as Disasterpeace, is strikingly haunting and very reminiscent of the popular slasher flicks of yesteryear. The whole movie just has that classic horror genre movie feel to it; like those directed by John Carpenter or George A. Romero. It feels a lot like a very haunting, and quite disturbing, nightmare; which is what Mitchell says he based the premise for the movie on (his own recurring bad dreams, about something constantly following him). There's of course a lot of unexplained mystery to it, and several aspects of the story that don't seem to always make sense, at all, but that's part of the movie's charm as well. I think 'IT FOLLOWS' will go down in history, as one of the truly great horror movie classics; just like all the ones that seem to have inspired it!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/-bmQZTEkHT0"

Basically, it's none of the things you want and so deeply crave in a horror/thriller film. The idea was solid, the acting was sufficient, the writing was mediocre, and that's all the good there is to say about it. And now the bad, for which i could just write the films title, NUFF SAID. But this is a review, so into the details. The music was repetitive, boring, and failed to create the proper atmosphere, which is a vital part of any film, particularly those in the horror genre. There was no emotional attachment to any of the characters. ""Oh Look! That dude just died!"" Whoopty doo. ""Hey! That chick just got herself killed!"" Aaaaand I don't care. ""Here's a random familial connection and some abrupt backstory that should inspire deep emotion in you!"" WHAT!? WHERE DID THAT EVEN COME FROM!?...oh, and I still don't care. The kills are lame, not that I mind. I prefer psychological fear factor over blood and guts. But then, there isn't any psychological fear factor to be found. And there aren't any real scares to be found either. Whether you're looking for in-your-face jump scares, or slow builds and glimpses in the corner of the frame, keep looking, because it's not to be found here. The only horror/thriller movies I've seen that didn't have a real fear factor at least had some thought provoking notions. Or at the very, very least, had some stomach turning scenes. All in all, if you liked this movie, GREAT! This review isn't for people who have seen it. For those of you who haven't got around to seeing it yet and, like me, are considering checking it out because the 7+ rating and the good reviews, I strongly urge you NOT TO WASTE AN HOUR AND FORTIE MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE. I almost never regret watching a movie, even if it's terrible, I can always pull something from it that makes it feel like time well spent. But this...this is different, it's just dull, so very, very, dull. It creates no fear, inspires no emotion, produces no thought. Quite simply, it sucks.

Several montage scenes of this movie's characters driving around at random indicates that you could transplant the Bates Motel, HELL HOUSE, THE CABIN IN THE WOODS, and every other Hollywood horror flick setting into the Wolverine State, and the residents there would see it as an upgrade. The high school kids pictured in IT FOLLOWS are so backwards they still have to use land lines! They spend about half their time at beaches, but they never seem to swim, since it's almost always too cold to go in. Because long-time Michigan resident Thomas Edison invented horror movies with his film ELECTROCUTING AN ELEPHANT (for real), and his victim Topsy has a long memory, it makes Karmic sense that Michigan would be Ground Zero for a new STD that transmits ghost zombies to the teens who sleep with everyone in sight, such as the kids in IT FOLLOWS. But this flick pales in comparison to the REAL LIFE horrors of Michigan, such as the story in the news during my visit of the single lady who moved to the Detroit area from the East Coast, died of unknown causes in her Jeep in her garage, and got mummified before she was discovered by the ""authorities"" FIVE YEARS LATER!"
"baumer","10","74","155","13 April 2015"," A shockingly brilliant horror movie
","Bar none, this is the best horror film I've seen in 10 years. This is a film that will get inside you and it won't let go, however if you are looking for gore, look elsewhere. <br/><br/>This review will contain some heavy spoilers.<br/><br/>Right from the opening scene, I was drawn in. There is an obvious 80's theme to this but we know it's modern times because one of the characters has what looks to be a data device. <br/><br/>This review will be spoiler heavy so if you don't want to know the nuts and bolts, skip over it. <br/><br/>The plot is a simple one. There is some kind of malevolent force that follows you around. The way you contract and eliminate this threat is by having sex. Somehow by having unprotected sex, you get it, and then, as the title says it follows you around. Only you can see this thing though. So every person who might look a little strange to you could be the force that is out to get you. And it creates paranoia because you don't know what's real and what isn't. This is an incredibly effective plot device in the film. As it is explained to J, after she gets it from her new boyfriend, this force can be anyone. It walks slow so you can buy yourself time by outrunning it or driving away but like the Terminator, it will not stop ever until you are dead. <br/><br/>The first 15 minutes has J having sex with her boyfriend, it's a nice experience that they share, and then as she is leaning over the backseat rambling on about whatever it is you ramble on about after sex, her boyfriend comes up behind her and puts a cloth with chloroform on it, around her mouth. She wakes up tied to a chair and he tells her what it is that's coming after her. He apologizes to her and explains that all she has to do is have sex with someone else and she's rid of it. But, if the thing that follows her manages to kill the person she passed it on to, then it will start after her again. So no one is safe, ever. <br/><br/>The cast are not really well known but J, as played by Maika Monroe, has been in some films but she's just not a name. That's going to change after this film. Not only is she strikingly beautiful, she absolutely nails the character. She's unabashedly terrified all throughout the film and when she's scared, you are scared for her. The rest of the cast is very good as well and there's a nice love triangle as one of her long time friends has loved her probably since they were kids, but he's not quite her type and this creates a lot of tension. He's willing to sleep with her and take the malevolent from her, that's how much he feels for her. <br/><br/>The look of the film is second to none as this was filmed entirely in Michigan and much of it in Detroit, where you see the poverty, the run down buildings, the old houses, the beat up 30 year old cars. The look of the film is basically a secondary character. It adds to the palette and creates tension. There's something more sinister about seeing an old 70's TV with rabbit ears and all the off, vomit inducing colours from the 80's carpet and wallpaper and such. <br/><br/>And then there's the soundtrack. I think the composer paid homage to about 8-10 horror themes. While not ripping them off, you can easily hear, Manfredini, Bernstein, Carpenter, Hermann and even some very obvious nods to something like Knowing where the soundtrack was overbearing but effective. I am simply in love with the music that was used here.<br/><br/>When you combine all of this together, you get one of the best horror films I've ever seen. Horror has had some good entries in the last decade imo but nothing can top this. It's frightening, tense, creates a lot of panic and leaves you guessing in almost every scene. Writer and director David Robert Mitchell has created one of the most terrifying and original horror films. I won't rank it right now because it's still so fresh but I am simply in love with this film. I honestly wanted to go right back into the theater to see it again.<br/><br/>It's also unapologetically rated R. There's lots of nudity, it's terrifying and if you were to bring kids to this, I think it would seriously have a chance to mess with their minds. IMO, horror was truly born in the 70's. I'm aware of Hitchcock's contribution to the genre, but the horror that I love was from the 70/80's. This is almost a love letter to the films of those decades. But in some ways, it does it better. It Follows might end up being the best film of the year.<br/><br/>As for the ending that some complain about. It's the perfect way to end the film. There is no other way to end it. This thing cannot be stopped. It just can't. So to have it look like a somewhat happy ending was cool.....until you see that no matter what they do, they will never get rid of it. The ending was terrific.<br/><br/>Every time I finish the review I just feel like going back and adding more. I can't say enough about it. This is about as original as it gets and that is a rare thing in today's cinema.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I was so excited to see this film. I have loved horror movies since watching ""Creature Features"" with my father and brother when younger, and I am pretty easy to please.

She is killed so then Jeff has to find someone else to sleep with?<br/><br/>How does Jeff know that ""It"" is following him because he had sex with a girl in a bar? How does he know if It kills Jay It will come back to kill him? How does he rent a house under a fake name, and why would he?

Where did all the electrical appliances come from? They were carrying some bags, but I don't think they were filled with irons, hairdryers and TVs. What was the point of trying to ""kill"" a ghost? It had already been shot, and that didn't stop it.<br/><br/>Why didn't Jay take 2 minutes and clean her bedroom door?<br/><br/>And the ghost/entity/phantom just comes after you at a walk?

","It really shouldn't have bothered, and I'm sorry I did. How they can churn out such nonsense with straight faces is beyond me. It lurched from one idiotic scene to the next and the 'scare' factor was limited to fear of dying of boredom. The concept of passing on curses is part of folklore of many countries but never has the concept been portrayed in such a nonsensical fashion. I fear for the industry when drivel like this is advertised and sold on mainstream cinema listings as folk really have better things to waste their money on. Some of the reviews that actually praised this movie leave me wondering about the neutrality of certain critics and has certainly reduced the trust, limited though it was in their musings.

"drownnnsoda","10","73","153","27 March 2015"," A modern American classic
","Yeah, I know that sounds lofty, but that's the impression this film left on me, and I believe has on many others as well. It's been a long time since I've left the theater after seeing a horror film feeling truly roused, and ""It Follows"" exceeded my wildest expectations.<br/><br/>The narrative here is fairly straightforward: A young college student, Jay (Maika Monroe) goes on a date with a guy. On their second outing together, the two have consensual sex in his car; all is well and normal, until he inexplicably chloroforms her. She awakens tied to a wheelchair in an abandoned building, and is warned in detail by her suitor that she's been bestowed a threatening supernatural entity that will follow her until making its fatal strike— the only way out is if she ""passes it on"" by having sex with someone else. <br/><br/>Is it a parable of female sexuality? A commentary on millennial sex culture? A veiled warning on the dangers of unprotected sex? I frankly don't know, and I don't think that's really the point here. While the topic of sex is a plot hinge, the real meat of this film is in its execution of concept. Newcomer David Robert Mitchell wrote and directed the film, and has essentially taken a basic concept and fleshed it out into a feature length exercise in disquietude. The reality of this film is that there is not much to the skeleton of it; it is heavy on concept and borderline emaciated on narrative, but not to its own detriment. The main reason the film works so well is because it operates on the universal fear that humans have of being followed— on the street, in our classrooms, in the grocery store, even in our own home. The fear of being followed and not knowing why or who is after you is terrifying on every conceivable level, and Mitchell's playful striking of this very nerve is what this film is all about.<br/><br/>This incessant terror creeps in through a series of unsettling and sometimes downright scary confrontations with the nebulous ""it"", which manifests as different people. Sometimes it's strangers, sometimes people the afflicted victim knows; in either case it is inescapable, and the film closes in on the world of its characters to claustrophobic effect.<br/><br/>The photography here is another large part of the ambiance in the film, with the camera capturing expansive views of a dilapidating Detroit, and the sleepy lives of young adults living on the suburban outskirts of it. The ambiguity of the time period is hand-in-hand with the general ambiguity of the film itself; the camera-work is sophisticated and even at times lyrical, presenting beautiful compositions and chilling run-ins with the various manifestations of ""it"", whether it be lurking in corners or slowly approaching the camera from distant landscapes. The scope is undoubtedly reminiscent of John Carpenter, which has been mentioned time and again, and while the film playfully references several other genre films, it does so without being obnoxious. Underlying all of this is a pulsing synth score that is jarring yet appropriate, and is perhaps the film's most ostentatious ""throwback"" element. Regardless, it works.<br/><br/>Skilled performances are the icing on the cake here, and make it all the more believable in all the unbelievability; Maika Monroe and Keir Gilchrist lead the cast, both turning in admirable and realistic performances, and the supporting cast members are equally believable. It's a rare instance in which I felt like the filmic representation of young adult ennui was on-par. These characters and their relationships toward one another look and feel very real. <br/><br/>While some have decried the film's showdown finale and conclusion, I didn't think there was really any better way to end a film like this. In a film whose core is so indefinite, all bets are off as far as I'm concerned, and maybe that's part of what makes the film so quietly scary— the threat lacks definition. The only conclusive attribute ""it"" has is that it follows you, and through a skillful amalgamation of atmospheric camera-work, evocative mood-setting, and strong performances, that is more than enough. Check your inhibitions at the door, and this film will follow you for days. 10/10."
"martymillman","8","41","81","30 March 2015"," Interesting Film
","It Follows is a 1980s style horror film about a sexually transmitted haunting. One thing you need to know before seeing this film is that it's not for all everyone because it's not like most horror films. It Follows is unlike the BS horror films Hollywood keeps putting out like Annabelle and Ouija. The film makers made it to tell a story, not just to throw some cheep recycled crap full of jump scares on the screen for two hours to steal your money. The film's cinematography was so beautiful I almost cried. The opening scene was just amazing, but sadly it set the bar a little to high for the film. (Maika Monroe) did a great job portraying her character, Jay, but some of her friends, like Paul (Keir Gilchrist), could have done a little bit better, but it still was not terrible. One of the main disappointments was the story. It had a good basis, but it had many plot holes. Also many critics said this is ""the scariest movie you'll ever see,"" but the scariest part of the whole movie was in first five minutes. Not to give away too much, but the opening is about a girl who had ""It"" before our Jay. The opening scene was pretty gory and terrifying, but that was all. The rest of the movie was not scary at all. One other thing about the film that was the writers portrayal of 80's horror. In most 80's horror the parents are never around, but when they are written out, they have an excuse to leave their kids alone in a time of crisis. In It Follows the parents are around, they just never come on screen. Also the teens were watching classic black and white science fiction comedy, which most teens don't. My friends and I do, but we don't dress and talk like it's the 80's too. Another thing that made no sense is that her friends offer to sleep with her so she doesn't have to worry about it anymore. These friends have seen how messed up ""It"" has made her, and they offer like it's no big deal to take ""It"" off her hands. Lastly there were many plot holes. There were some points where it was OK to leave you guessing, but there were some major plot holes. Like the rules behind ""It"" were very confusing. In the beginning it is said that ""It' can't touch you, ""It"" touches Jay at least three times through out the film and she's just fine. Then there are a few scenes where ""It"" disguises itself as a a creepy old lady, a naked old man, or a beat up bloody cheerleader. Also there are some tiny plot holes with her kid neighbors, but it was not that big of a deal. Some bigger plot holes are like when the main characters are trying to get rid of ""It"" they just sleep with anyone. If whoever has ""It"" gets killed, ""It"" goes back to haunt whoever had it last, knowing this, why didn't the characters just sleep with someone who has a lot of sex. If given to just some random person at a bar who had sex quite often, ""It"" could then then ""be passed further and further away from the characters, so even if ""It"" keeps going down the line killing people, it'll be a while before ""It"" gets back to you. This is finally realized at the end, but it unknown if Jay and her friends are really free of ""It"". Saying all that, the film was great, but it could have been better."

"fbossert","Null","45","90","28 June 2015"," At last a great horror film that's not from Asia
","First of all, I'm an amateur of the genre: I watch dozens of horror films a year. It is quite a frustrating habit: very rarely you run into something remotely satisfying, and even more rarely into something that actually scares you. But this has been a very good year so far: first I found Lake Mungo, now this extraordinary gem. It's hard to say anything about it without spoiling the experience on some level. First of all: forget about what you've read as taglines or synopsis on IMDb: nothing of that will give you a clue of what this film is about. Sex is the least of the matters -and by no means this is, as I read here, a moralist or anti-sex film. Please, don't look for such direct and basic metaphors, this is not a high school class. Also forget about the possible goofs or contradictions pointed out in other reviews: would you look for coherence in David Lynch? or in a nightmare? Same indulgence should apply here. What matters are the images that this film succeeds to create, and that will linger in your mind much afterwards. The film avoids all the usual clichés that were just around the corner: no dilemma about the protagonist being or not being crazy, no romantic sub-plot, no one screaming at the camera all-of-the-sudden, no blood, no violence, no FX. Fiends are people -only very awkward people. The horror here is of the most subtle kind: nothing that you can't avoid by running away or even by walking fast. Three images kept ringing in my head while I watched it: 1) the twin girls at the end of the corridor in The Shining (the cinematography is almost an homage to Kubrick, with visually stunning symmetric shots and striking music), 2) a scene of the underrated Tsukamoto's Nightmare Detective 2 (the film also draws from the bone of Asian horror, leaving aside the already boring girls with hair on their faces -namely, the reference to a urban myth, and a story that takes place exclusively among youngsters), 3) Robert Aickman's story The Fetch. I cannot reveal here the reasons why, but I will tell you this: the fiend here has that slow, inexorable, despairing way of approaching you that horror has in nightmares. This film will be a classic of the genre, and I definitely will be following David Mitchell's efforts from now on."

","This is simply one terrifying movie. The idea of some entity always knowing where you are and always watching is a horrifying idea that comes in the form of a nightmare. I highly advise to see this movie. It is one of the best paced horror films I've ever seen. It keeps a creepy and dark atmosphere throughout and mixes in horrifying visuals and jump scares that stay with you the whole movie. The pacing is slow, but there's an atmosphere in it that is intense and freaky, like you know some thing is about to happen. It keeps it's subtle horror throughout the movie even when nothing is going on, because the thing can always come at any time and can always be there stalking. I never get truly creeped out by movies but this one stays under your skin and keeps you wondering and thinking days after watching it. It's an incredibly terrifying film that doesn't use cheap blood and jumps to deliver its scares. It keeps the horrifying mood throughout that always makes you peek over your shoulder every 2 seconds. You definitely need to have patience to appreciate this film, but if you can get past the little dialogue and plot and focus on the idea the film is presenting I guarantee it will turn into the most terrifying film you will watch. It will go down as a modern horror classic."
"dfa120374","3","29","55","2 August 2015"," Another Hugely Over-Hyped ""Clever"" Film
","I was looking forward to seeing this film since I saw the trailers for it as it looked to be a very creepy, tense, clever, and atmospheric horror (which is what I enjoy watching). I was actually eager to watch it and there's not been many films recently I can say that about. Unfortunately, I was hugely disappointed after watching it as It Follows is a MASSIVE let down, and I can't actually believe that it has been rated so highly.<br/><br/>Now, people will probably say ""Oh, you don't get it"" or ""you don't like it because there was no blood & guts""...you know, the typical childish responses you get when you criticise a ""clever"" film. Well, I'm not thick, and a horror doesn't have to have a ton of gore for me to enjoy, but this was just a very poor telling of what could - and should - have been a much, much creepier film.<br/><br/>It Follows started off well enough, setting up what I thought would be a good tone & atmosphere for the rest of the movie. It didn't pan out that way because while the tone & atmosphere were decent enough (in part), it was severely lacking in a lot of other areas such as...<br/><br/>1) Acting: this was VERY poor, and after the scenes with Annie at the start of the movie, some of the acting was less than convincing. Almost B-movie esk at times.<br/><br/>2) Thrills: a complete minimal amount of this and it was more boring than thrilling.<br/><br/>3) Scare/creep factor: definitely NOT a scary film and only two or three moments from throughout were creepy and gave off an uneasy feel.<br/><br/>4) Pace: absolutely none. The film just crawled along at snail's pace from start to end.<br/><br/>Oh, and speaking of the ending - what a huge disappointment that also was. I detest movies that end the way It Follows ended, but in a way it was spot on for this film as it capped off a perfectly over-hyped, slow, boring, and disappointing ""horror"".<br/><br/>Honestly, don't be taken in by the hype surrounding this film, but if you decide to watch it then good luck. I just hope you enjoy it more than what I did."

"prosch-37089","10","66","138","11 May 2015"," John Carpenter and Nicholas Winding Refn had a baby
","My love for this kind of film started a long time ago. From the first Freddy or Jason film to John Carpenter masterpieces like HALLOWEEN or PRINCE OF DARKNESS, ""IT FOLLOWS"" captures similar beautiful minimalism in both its dialog and score as does its predecessors. Is the film original? YES. There are not many sexually-transmitted disease horror films out there. There are horror films that have a sexual drive to their plot like TEETH, but this film manages to find a new avenue to combine sex and terror, which is like finding a new place to put cheese on a pizza.<br/><br/>I am going to tell you why this film IS a modern-day masterpiece: The film's opening scene is not something that you understand until after your first viewing. We are thrust into a scene that has a young girl in high heels and casual hang-out-in-my-bed clothing. At first, the viewer is forced to ask questions like, ""Why is she running around?"" or ""Why doesn't she get help from the lady who asks her if she needs help?"" or ""Why does she tell her dad everything is OK when everything obviously is NOT OK?"" and last but not least, ""Why is she wearing stiletto heals to run in?"" After the movie was over for my first view of it, I re-watched the film. At the beginning, all my questions had answers. She was in her room watching out her window for IT. Seeing it approaching her house from enough distance to get away from IT, she grabs (in a mad panic) the first pair of shoes she can slip on her feet so she doesn't run on the asphalt barefoot (she didn't have time to go looking for shoes that made sense). This is the genius of the director. He is literally showing us what it is like to be followed by IT from the standpoint of the ""safe"" onlooker who cannot see IT. Watching someone run around in no general direction or pattern in heels looking back every 2 seconds like she is being chased by something terrible that is not there is pretty crazy-looking. You, as the spectator (like the woman unloading groceries from her van) are forced to ask the girl questions. ""Are you OK?"" Next, she waits across the street, waiting for the slow-walking (invisible to us) IT to follow her far enough down the road that she can run back across the street and get her car keys which she forgot to grab the first run outside. She drives a good ways away from her house and sits on the ground in front of her car with the car lights on. Her dad calls to check on her and she apologizes for being a bad child. Evidently, she is tired of running and NOT willing to have sex with anyone to pass it on, so she surrenders to IT. The next shot is of her dead on shore with her leg snapped in half at the knee and it looks like her other leg was mauled too.<br/><br/>This opening reveals everything possible from the IT. IT moves slowly. IT is deadly. IT must be passed on or it will kill you. IT is invisible to everyone except to the one IT is following.<br/><br/>In line at the theater, Jay wants to play a game where you pick someone you wish you could trade places with and see if the other person can guess who you picked. Jay's date picks a little boy drinking at a water fountain with his dad, while Jay picks someone inside the actual theater. When her date tries to point out who she possibly picked, he picks IT. IT is a girl in a yellow dress that Jay CANNOT see! Her date is infected with IT. He makes up some quick excuse to leave so he can escape IT from touching him. He lies and says he felt ill and that he needed to get outside where he feels better. Evidently fed up with being chased everywhere, completely different from the girl at the beginning, Jay's date makes the immoral choice to pass IT to her when she initiates wanting to go back to the car and have sex with him. He shows us that he was planning on passing IT to her that night anyway by keeping a rag with chloroform in the trunk (which he uses on her). Strapping her into a wheelchair (also in his trunk) he waits for IT to come so he can see if IT is after him or her. And he wants her to see IT so that she can see he is not crazy and to follow his instructions to pass it on to get rid of IT.<br/><br/>That is as far into the film as I will take you. But I can tell you that every shot is a poster shot. Every use of the score is amazing. The atmosphere created by the director is much like DRIVE had with the nice angles, the use of nature and water, and several scenes with cars. The music reminded me of like a TROMA film. Like a score that almost is making fun of a John Carpenter score rather than an actual mimic. But, do not get me wrong...this film is serious throughout and has nothing campy at all in it.<br/><br/>While DRIVE was a beautiful violent film...IT FOLLOWS is a beautiful horror film."

"njs-55801","6","38","75","14 May 2015"," A modern take the suburban fear of everything
","It Follows takes a familiar horror film storyline – suburban teen pursued by unknown evil – and delivers a new take on it through an original plot and an opening up of the teenage worldview with the roles sex, death, and fear play in the self-obsessed teenage mind. It also takes a long look back at John Carpenter's early horror movies, especially Halloween, in its music and long, slow camera moves, although the film is none the worse for it; the creeping horror slowly gaining on the central character, Jay, is effectively built up and Maika Monroe is excellent at portraying the haunted, trapped girl – trapped by her unwillingness to pass on the curse as much as by the curse itself. The film exists in an isolated, disconnected teenage world, where parents barely exist, a teacher is just a disembodied voice in a classroom, and the characters start off just sitting around doing very little then progress to running from place to place with little idea of what to do when they arrive. The film captures the aimless intensity of teenagers, the constant awareness of sex and the vague awareness of its perils, giving the film a depth most horror movies don't have. The basis of this is the plot premise of passing on a curse through sex. This can be seen as any number of allegories – sin, death, disease, guilt, and all those good things! This metaphorical dimension makes it more a semi-horror than full on horror film. Although the opening sequence ends with a gruesome image and there's a nasty incest/rape murder later on the film relies on building tension through inventive cinematography that is always looking for paranoid, claustrophobic angles and simple camera moves such as constantly closing in on Jay. Another interesting aspect of It Follows is the depiction of the suburban relation to the city. Filmed in Michigan and Detroit, the city the characters travel into is a desolate place, full of ruined housing and a ruined economy where people hang around because there's nowhere else to go. It's a reality check such a subjective film benefits from – suburban inner demons complemented by suburban fear of the city. It raises an interesting question: which is worse, a teen who sleeps with the wrong guy or the complete annihilation of American cities over the last decade?"
"Necroambulant","10","58","120","12 May 2015"," Does for Sex What The Ring Did for Videotapes
","It Follows is one of those movies that relies on atmosphere to carry it...and, unlike numerous others, it succeeds in setting an eerie and unsettling atmosphere that reinforces the story. Between the musical score, the acceptably decent narrative, acting that successfully lends realism and plausibility to a pretty far fetched (though exceedingly uncomfortable) premise, and directing that capitalizes on all of those elements in such a way as to create a very memorable movie that sticks with you after the credits are rolling...this ended up being a movie that lived up to the interest it piqued in me from seeing the trailers. Think of it as The Ring, but with sex as the method of transmission. The correlation with American adaptation of The Ring is appropriate in other ways as well, there is a similarly pervasive atmosphere and an artistic build up that fluctuates between subtle intervals and tense moments that make for a strong overall flow. There is a part of me that thinks teachers should show this in sexual education classes just to make the whole idea of sex as uncomfortable as possible for children and adolescents...because making kids afraid of sex until they are old enough to rationalize that this is entirely fiction might be effective. Hit them when they are young enough and this movie could absolutely implant a bit of fear at the prospect of having sex. Of course I'm not being serious there, since fear of sex is probably about as counterproductive as abstinence-only education...potentially more so. I'm sure there will be mixed feelings from people who watch this one, but personally I found it to be one of the best horror movies I've seen...I like this sort of movie quite a bit though, not that I have seen many along these lines. I'm not going to give anything away. You'll just have to watch it for yourself. Comment"
"samgeaney","10","65","136","4 March 2015"," Probably the best horror I've ever seen
","I'm struggling to think of a horror that tops this. I am constantly looking for horrors that are to my taste but find that the majority of them fall short, especially those released in the past decade. Blood, gore and violence is not enough for me or I'd say most horror fans but directors seem to think otherwise. David Robert Mitchell, however, fully understands this in a film that has little to no gore and instead makes perfect use of slowly built tension. The only film that I can think of that comes close to this tension wise is The Shining and, although a completely different style, the scariest was perhaps REC but I think they may have just been surpassed. This isn't a big jumpy horror so those going to this expecting such will be disappointed. However, those looking to engage with a film that draws you in and holds the tension throughout will not be left disappointed.<br/><br/>One of the best aspects of this cinematic experience is the soundtrack by Disasterpiece; the artist known for his work on indie platform game ""Fez"". The soundtrack to this excellent horror builds tension throughout rarely releasing the listener. The music in collaboration with the creative cinematography makes this film as engrossing as possible. The dizzying spinning shots are some of the most tense and the time between showing the ""Follower"" in shots leaves the audience tensely waiting to see how close it has gotten. This was the most tense film I think I have ever seen. I loved the use of art-house aspects without ever going over the top and losing the run of itself. Disasterpiece's dark synth soundtrack is a masterpiece on its own and is thankfully being released, not that it could be listened to whilst relaxing. Disasterpiece did a fine job and I look forward to hearing more of his music like this if he decides to release more. After this, who knows, maybe he will become a highly sought after film score composer. I sure hope so anyway.<br/><br/>I was curious after having read reviews because the trailer seemed to show little more than a run-of-the-mill horror. I am very glad I decided to go and experience this to its fullest in a big cinema with surround sound. It was a wonderful experience leaving me in a state of bliss afterwards wanting to tell the world just how wonderful this film was.....so here I am.<br/><br/>I have seen my fair share of horrors and read a large number of horror novels but none have all too successfully scared or creeped me out other than the occasional jump which has no lasting appeal. This film, however, held me tense throughout and I loved the thrill ride. There are briefs moments where the tension breaks but these do not last long as the viewer knows all is not well just yet and the tension begins building once more. This film shows the power of cinema and the importance of soundtrack in collaboration with the cinematography. A big budget is not needed to create a great horror and this film displays that with ease.<br/><br/>The film owes a lot to horror films of the 70s and 80s but it far surpasses them. The synth soundtrack is a modern take on soundtracks of the 80s and John Carpenter style motifs. The tension built takes influence from The Shining. In saying this, It Follows is one of the most original horrors I have ever seen. It takes in so many influences and makes them its own.<br/><br/>I have probably gone on and on a bit too much about this film but, in my opinion, it was a masterpiece."

But now a couple of days has gone by and... i still feel the same way as before...<br/><br/>I didn't watch any trailer for this movie because i have seen to many trailers for horror movies that ruins some of the scariest scenes, i still haven't seen the trailer so i don't know if it's spoiling anything but it doesn't matter because this movie is SO OVER HYPED!!<br/><br/>The story is simple, don't have sex or you might get an HIV-ghost that will follow you until it gets you and you die or you can sleep with some one else and now they got the HIV-ghost following them... seriously that is the whole story... no twists, no explanation what the HIV-ghost is or why it follows people who have sex... maybe it's just jealous that you got to have sex, that's my guess because like i said nothing gets explained and that wouldn't have bothered me if the movie was good... <br/><br/>I give the movie a 3 out of 10 because it was actually some scary parts ( but even more missed opportunities...), i really liked how the movie was filmed and finally a movie were the friends was there to help her even if they didn't believe her at first but as all good friends would have done, being there for support... but over all the movie sucked, the story sucked, the reason why it follows you, the ending when they where at the pool was so bad!!!

","What a bad movie! Please don't let you fool by the ratings. The only point which I have given have is for the acting that was of the lead actors be fine for some newbies. Directed super amateurish. For example, at some point they are going to a swimming pool. They take with them a few light small cases and the whole furniture magically appears. Type machines, TVs, lamps you name it. Not exactly thought about it..... Then she says ""he's coming"", her friends ask what it looks like, she says""I'd rather not say"" so then you think well here it comes! Finally some scary in this movie. But is just a simple man. The only fright time you will experience is a ball hit against the window. They try to keep the tension in the whole movie there, with their 80 's horror tunes, but there is just simply no tension in this movie at all. This whole movie is rather very humorous. What sick mind conceived this film has Lord know .... Vague open end too. It's just getting nowhere in this movie. Don't waste your time on it. Unless you are really stoned, than it might be a fun movie to watch I guess...."
"stuartvanlinden","10","57","118","30 June 2015"," A modern horror classic that comes along all too rarely
","I seriously recommend seeing ""It Follows"" - just released on Blu-Ray and DVD. It's one of the best horror films to be released in the 21st century so far, imo. Artistic without ever being pretentious, ripe with a sexual-political subtext without ever being gratuitous, beautifully shot and at times, very, very frightening. I liked it when I saw it in the cinema a few months ago, and just saw it on Blu-Ray and absolutely loved it. Modern horror is a quagmire of sh*t, for the most part, but to save you from digging, ""It Follows"" is a diamond among the cack, and deserves to be hailed as a classic in years to come. I urge you to see it."

If you really want to see it, wait a month and you can probably get it for a dollar at Goodwill, that's where it's bound to end up.

"dulyman","8","41","82","19 May 2015"," Unique and refreshing Horror/Thriller
","I love horror movies, I give even the worst ones a try and often cant get through the first 30 minutes because of bad dialogue and the over fantasticalistic acting that often is the true horror of the movie. <br/><br/>I actually expected that from this movie and didn't want to pay very much attention to it due to my clash of clans fixation but this film took me off my phone from the start and it held me to the finish. <br/><br/>The concept was great and slightly different to the norm, which was refreshing, but the real strength of the movie is the use of imagery and music to really tell a story, hold the mystery and create a feel for the emotions of the characters. <br/><br/>Generally I judge movies by my ability to predict what will happen next and often I can regurgitate the timeline of the movie after seeing the trailer. This movie had me guessing and in suspense the whole time, so bravo a rare experience for me.<br/><br/>Lastly I have to say the style of the movie was great, for me, I think it will help set this movie apart from the genre. it reminded me very much of the movie ""driver"" only this movie was interesting. The world was real; no bimbos running and screaming through the forest of their parents 32 bedroom mansion with the creature perusing at 50mph right up until the last inch, where the monster loses the victim. None of that junk here. The people were believable, relate-able and represented the part of the world and situation they are coming from. <br/><br/>Great film, I hope to see more from the writer/director. I would have given the film a 9 but there were some things the characters did that suspended belief for me."
"rakwriter","1","153","344","7 April 2015"," It Fails
","First off, the opening sequence is completely unnecessary, and only serves to establish ""it"" kills- -a given attribute. If all it does is offer hugs and free popcorn, why would it need to follow? Just set up a booth at a carnival.<br/><br/>Second, ""It Follows"" is a quintessential example of idiot characters. The ""don't go in there"" trope is rarely absent. The scripting rarely pushes the plot forward and is largely unrealistic, like the character reactions. The only logical thing they do is run from ""it.""<br/><br/>""It Follows"" is a 2-hour montage of logical inconsistencies painted with a brush of blurry camera work, lazy editing, and sound production that sounds more often like a malfunction in the speakers of the auditorium. The music was distracting and smacked of grating '80s slasher flicks, but not in a way that could even be mistaken as homage.<br/><br/>One thing that makes horror effective is an explanation of the evil, while leaving specifics like how or even whether it can be defeated up to the protagonists to figure out. This movie barely accomplishes the latter, while the former is left a mystery. That tactic can work, but it fails here because there is no explanation of why it is passed on the way it is, or how it was created.<br/><br/>""It Follows"" is like a teen slasher that wants to be trendy and cool, kind of like the junior in high school that wants to drink with the college kids. It may seem like it's fitting in, but in reality it stands out in an awkward way and ends up being ignored while it gags in the bathroom."

","This film was amazing. Scary and gritty but most of all real. A total change from the run of the mill middle class American movies. The teen characters seemed like real people. Having a smoke without it being a big deal, showing real areas in the states with boarded up, run down houses, the type you know exist but you never see on an American film. Real teen emotion, not an add for middle class, we are so cool USA. No jocks, no cheerleaders, just real humans living a normal working class life, even after the horror starts. This was low budget and really goes to show that you don't need zillions of dollars to come up with a good script and set.

Except way, way slower.<br/><br/>Some people mention tension too. Where?!? It's either walking right at you like a zombie or it's not It. Every time someone walked by not even facing them they yelled out ""can you see them!?!"" It was obvious it wasn't It.<br/><br/>There's one good scene where they're on the beach but that's it. And during that scene I was trying to figure out why in the world you would go hang at the beach when you're being hunted. What they should have done was wait until It shows. Drive to a certain location. Wait til It shows there. Look at a clock and figure out how long it took. Then you can go back to location one and actually prepare for it without worrying about how much time you have.<br/><br/>There were so many little scenes that just didn't make sense too.

"billygoat1071","10","51","105","20 May 2015"," Fear on the Zone
","It Follows presents an obvious metaphor about the consequences of teenage sex. Instead of STDs, the movie features a curse that is better off explained in the actual movie. The movie shows a horror trick that somehow becomes rare but proves that it still works in today's audience. In a time of unending gore and jump scares (which, of course, still exist in this movie), the practical kind of horror It Follows provides is the fear from the distance. But the movie also sets up an atmosphere that could outcome the worst of the threat that the characters are being haunted from. It just breathes into the terror, thus it's undeniably creepy and surprisingly smart, with some admirable inspirations from the old school horror.<br/><br/>The film starts off building its mood and atmosphere, trying to introduce the fear in a disorienting way, but the audience will remain sticking into the experience. The story just explores a typical lifestyle of a teenage protagonist; either trying to look innocent or just hanging out and being lazy with her friends. It's a common representation of the adolescents, but it doesn't get too unlikeable as many horror films tend to portray these days. Once the actual premise has been revealed, the tension just rises into a new level. The scares are visible, but shown in different forms, literally and otherwise. The camera mostly shoots a horror scene from the distance, either the spectator's perspective like the beach scene from Under The Skin, or something tension driven where the enemy is coming closer like the chase scene in Rian Johnson's Brick. But it's more about feeling it than seeing it, the movie has already painted the tone from its cinematography and music score, and when things go wrong from both aspects, you should expect the real impending danger from the main character.<br/><br/>The rules of the villain may not be that clear, even in a metaphorical sense, there are times that it sort of drops the ball, but then, there wasn't an exact answer from how this thing works. It's all up to a mystery solving from its characters. It may sound exciting, but the atmosphere that turns their environment into otherworldly remains. The direction is all affectionate inspiration from both horror and art-house. The former is already too obvious by its soundtrack, but the camera also chooses any angles it can, as long as it captures wherever the evil might come right into the main character, even when she is strapped on a wheelchair, driving a car, or lying on a hospital bed. The latter is pretty much adding the mood, like picturing the melancholy of their lives and the darkness of being bound with the sexually transmitted curse. And the main actress, Maika Monroe, really embraces whatever tone the movie takes.<br/><br/>It Follows is best described as brilliantly crafted, even if it's mostly based on inspirations. It would have been a gimmick, but it does all of the styles right and it fits perfectly for its ridiculously clever premise. The rules of its killer may not be that straight, but at the same time, it already does right at creeping us out. It's great when the film is just letting everything in action more than explaining. And luckily, it did. Therefore, it's beautiful and uneasy. It's all about feeling their doomed situation and worry about the possibilities that the conflict may do to the characters. And while horror movies today only seek for cheap scares and nothing else, it's kind of cool of seeing one of the rare that is both disturbing and thought-provoking. Once again, only the indie-horror that got it right."
"Zulfmanauthor","8","39","78","9 June 2015"," Simply chilling!
","This modern day horror film is highly rated based on a simple idea of a young girl who is stalked by a malevolent presence. The style in which it is made, and even the story itself takes you back to the classic horror movies of the 70s and 80s. In fact it reminded me of the original 'Amytville horror' movies and 'Poltergeist'. It begins with the ordinary life of a young girl who has a sexual encounter with a young boy, from this point her living nightmare begins. The viewer experiences her desperate search for an answer to this supernatural force which manifests itself in different ways. The film remains creepy and it's chill can be felt with the characters being believable and likable as they battle something that is crude and evil. The film seems to have an underlying message for teenagers as 'It' seems to represent the filth of society and the evils of debauchery and changing sex partners. However away from the moral messages, this film is a future horror classic and I hope a sequel is coming soon. @zulfmanauthor"

Did I like this because it was really good, or did I like it because I know it has gotten real good reviews?<br/><br/>I don't usually buy into hype, because I've many times experienced that movies ""everybody"" loves, ain't always that good. Therefore I think It follows is pretty good.<br/><br/>But let's just get right into it. It Follows has some genuinely creepy scenes. Really creepy. I actually got goosebumps at one time. And I don't goosebump easily from horror.<br/><br/>Personally I could have taken a couple more creepy scenes, but maybe they work better since they are not that many. Apart from the creepiness of some scenes, the atmosphere in the movie in general kind of weighs down on you. There's some good use of sound effects and music here. It's unsettling and dark, and you kind of wonder if there is something the movie isn't telling you. <br/><br/>The acting is really good. I don't think we've seen the last of Maika Monroe! She works very well because even though she is pretty and hot, she looks like a normal teenager. (she doesn't wear tons of make up, always having perfect hair and being unhealthily skinny) I really liked that. <br/><br/>So, try to forget the hype (hype always ruins) and watch It Follows for a somewhat different and creepy little flick."
"YT_RealJoshTv","8","39","78","6 June 2015"," I liked it
","Let's start with pro's, it was a unique horror/thriller with a plot i've never seen or thought of before. There was nothing that took me out of the moment completely. There are lots of unique camera angles that do a good job in making you feel in the situation. To give an example when you learn what the entity is/how it works there are a good amount of shots that make you feel like you never know when you will see it coming. Also there were only like 3 jump scares, my girlfriend and I didn't know what was going to happen or how it would end. Now to the few con's, there are too many times that they do something stupid that could have been avoided to get more suspense out of the situation, it slightly took away to the realness feel of the situation. Also I felt that this movie would have benefited from a more sneaky complex plan to handle or deal with the entity, sometimes there is no out of the box kind of thinking amongst the group. All in all though i really liked it and the freshness of the story, definitely worth a watch. For the people who say not enough was explained about certain parts, i feel like there was an aura of mystery to it and i in no way felt jipped out of parts in the story. And for the person who said sarcastically ""a plane ticket was out of the question"" there are lots of problems with that scenario in my opinion, i don't want to give any parts of the story away explaining why i think that but when i think of how it works doing something like that would have to be very planned out and timed to perfection for it work with the way the entity works."
"CinemaClown","Null","39","78","5 June 2015"," It Doesn't Think. It Doesn't Feel. It Doesn't Give Up. It Follows.
","Retro in style, accomplished in production & very effective in execution, It Follows is an expertly crafted, skilfully narrated & ingeniously composed indie horror which arrives as a refreshing take on its genre that beautifully blends the aesthetics of John Carpenter films with contemporary indie settings to deliver a cinema that's creepy, sinister & downright chilling.<br/><br/>It Follows tells the story of Jay; a college student whose life is turned upside down when, after an innocent sexual encounter, she's informed by her date that he passed on a curse to her, the curse being a supernatural entity which will now be pursuing her at all times & the only probable way to get rid of it is to pass the curse along to others before the entity gets to her.<br/><br/>Written & directed by David Robert Mitchell, the film manages to create an impending sense of doom within its opening moments & never lets it settle down until the end credits start rolling. The screenplay also deserves a mention because the story, despite its laughable premise, isn't paper-thin but digs much deeper than expected & can be interpreted in more ways than one.<br/><br/>Coming to the technical aspects, It Follows makes efficient use of its resources, starting with the 80s vibe it is able to evoke with its detailed set pieces & remote locations. The way its camera uses the stillness, 360-degree pans & slow zooms make the experience all the more unsettling. And Editing is a gem in itself that paces its 100 minutes of runtime in a very controlled manner.<br/><br/>But the best thing about It Follows is its magnificent score. Composed by Disasterpeace & comprising of heavily synthesised tracks, the soundtrack contributes greatly in sustaining the film's nail-biting tension & amplifying its suspense. Coming to the performances which isn't really the film's strongest suit, Maika Monroe is possibly the only one who manages to make her mark, even if it happens in bits n pieces.<br/><br/>Despite all that, I can't help but feel quite underwhelmed by the whole experience because, considering the universal acclaim it has garnered ever since it made its debut on the silver screen, I expected much more than what it had in store. It's not that what it offers isn't impressive, it's actually pretty amazing to be honest, but that abrupt ending was quite unexpected & certainly leaves behind a feeling of incompleteness.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, It Follows is in every way a welcome addition to its genre that never abandons its menacing tone for some cheap thrills and certainly carries more substance than the majority of horror films released in the past few years. Even if this minimalist horror isn't frightening on a visceral scale, the fearsome aura it is able to generate over the course of its runtime is sure to keep the viewers on the edge of their seats. Definitely recommended."
"johntheholder","8","39","78","4 June 2015"," It Follows doesn't disappoint.
","Basically it's the camera work of this fine up and coming director David Robert Mitchell who handled this horror film with respect to the genre. Along with the great photography and ---- of course, the lead actress Maika Monroe who's a pleasure to watch. After having watched The Guest in which she also is cast , i went to see this film. There are certain comparisons in the two films - both horror films- the synth music , and maybe hints of the same kind of atmosphere - and that it emphasises on young people and not the parents or older ones. <br/><br/>I liked both of them , but i think "" It Follows "" heads higher. Because it also reminded me of "" the shining"" , basically the eerie shots the director filmed in various points , for instance , the ones that are full screen moving sceneries - no people or familiar objects in sight , just moving scenery. It added the haunting vibes , of which the film has plenty and thus , its a successful horror film. <br/><br/>The actors overall were solid in their roles. The music was perhaps exceptional. The director certainly paid homage to older horror films , he didn't copy techniques , but he used them to create something of his own , and that is admirable. <br/><br/>Because It Follows is original. You can compare it to films coming close to it , but in essence it stands alone. <br/><br/>Again , great photography , apparently of Detroit suburbia and solid filming. <br/><br/>The reason it got a 7 by me , and not more , is that it got tiresome at a point where you are too familiar with what's happening , you know the pattern. Still , due to the good filming and the cast's work it managed to stand , but there was a mild sense of --- ""ok i get it now - lets move on"". Maybe it was just me , but i got that thought at a point about two thirds into the film.<br/><br/>But this is me stating maybe the only "" minus "" of this otherwise great film. So don't be put off by this remark. <br/><br/>It will scare you , do watch it with friends , girlfriend/boyfriend or alone , just be warned , it does the job.<br/><br/>Well done to the director , a great second feature film to have made. <br/><br/>Looking forward to both the director's next work , and the actress's Maika Monroe's with whom i'm starting to have a moderate obsession."

The plot goes above and beyond in that nothing about it is clichéd or expected. It is not sadistic or gross and just meant to be terrifying for the sake of a cheap thrill.The directing is frightening and the cuts are so cleverly done.<br/><br/>Jay (Maika Monroe) goes on a date to the movies with Jeff (Jake Weary) where suddenly he sees a girl he knows, acts weird wants to leave they drive around and finally have sex in the car. As Jay tell Jeff that she always dreamed of this moment he pulls a handkerchief to her face. As she wakes up in a dodgy garage all tied up he tells her, he is cursed and things take on shape and form of loved ones, friends, family pass it on or they will come after you and you will die and look he pointed to a naked woman coming towards them. He runs and takes her to his car and as he's driving fast he answers how he got it from a girl at a bar he barely remembers.<br/><br/>He kicks her out of the car, friends take her to the hospital and next day he disappears and that he did not even give her his real name and the house he was staying at does not have the same name. This perhaps the emotional kick and lies that happen for guys to get sex sometimes and some girls too because it all goes down to urges. So it is a wakeup call for all.<br/><br/>So after trying not to want to pass it on yet again Jay gives in to her urges and keeps passing it on yet these things follow her repeatedly. Not to spoil the rest of this amazing movie. This is clearly a curse of an STD just represented as harmful creatures that kill. Sex opens up a vicious cycle that would have not started had Jay remained innocent. That's a major lesson for teenagers to learn about safe sex in a direct overt way to know it should not be taken lightly. 'Reality Bites' briefly presents this issue but not like this movie that makes it even more crystal clear that is not to be messed with it is not cool to have this issue.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie Jay's sister Kelly ( Lili Sepe), her friend Yara (Olivia Luccardi), Paul (Keir Gilchrist) and Greg (Daniel Zovatto) try to help as best they could but nothing is ever good enough or even permanent it seems. Suffice to say that's an opened can of worms that cannot be closed; the damage is done and it's not cool or fun.<br/><br/>This movie is very educational and takes a darker look at the consequences of sex for youth. These consequences of wanting to have sex and lose one's virginity then what happens after? There is so much guilt and fear involved and that is frightening enough. This movie simply and beautifully portrays that harsh reality. STD aside the concept of sex and everyone trying to be grown up while they are not and not getting adults involved like in the movie makes sense but it really shouldn't because issue become scary and this movie has issues that sort of escalate and get out of hand. Yet teenagers can be independent and mature no doubt about that."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""It Follows"" (2014) has got some really intriguing idea. It's not the most original horror plot, but it will definitely raise a question - ""what would i did in this kind of situation?"" - so you can count this one as having a truly kind of original horror movie plot twist.<br/><br/>Execution of this plot is also done not in a traditional way. Cinematography is terrific in here - there are some steady and long shoots, there is no shaky camera, so you can always see bright and clear what is going on. Direction, writing are very solid. Music was also very good, and not a traditional horror movie theme. Acting was good, much better than in average horror flick, although no one here will win anything for in acting department.<br/><br/>And yet, i'm giving to ""It Follows"" ""only"" 8/10 - seeing the praises from critics i thought the final rating will be higher. Don't get me wrong - this is an exceptionally well made and kind of original horror picture. It barely drags and is involving from start till finish. But it doesn't grab you as hard as it could have, the premise and execution of it's parts are better then the whole. Nevertheless, this is superbly well crafted horror picture, which in my opinion isn't THAT scary, but it has great mood, great idea, terrific cinematography, great direction. All in all, this is good movie."

The greyish, slow, beautiful setting got me interested, the beautiful actors as well. As the storyline developed I found myself sitting by the edge of my seat. The idea in this horror movie is NEW, refreshing... mesmerizing. You always want to know whats next, looking over your shoulder. The ending is superb! Keeps you wanting more...

","I'm a big fan of the horror movies genre and went to see the movie as a great and scary movie. I was greatly disappointed! The movie is very dull, no background of what's happening there or of the people involved in the story. Actors, well, I can't call them actors, did a poor job a child can act better than them. Music in the background is nice gets you in the mood, but nothing happens so it lives with a bitter aftertaste. The idea of the movie is really good, and could be turned into a great movie, but the director or the writer missed it. If I'm not mistaken the movie is Australian, they can make great horror movies like the Babadook, which is really giving you the creeps. I truly don't understand what did people find scary in this movie."

","From the beginning until the end, I found the actors of the movie untalented and ignorant. I was close to walking out after 20 minutes into the movie, then I realized i actually payed money to see it.<br/><br/>Not since ""The spider man strikes back"" series that was made in 1977, have I ever seen a such worthless movie. No horror, no scary parts, but bizarre and disgusting. I mean, the movie was pretty much about a guy trying to get into the main characters pants. And during the time it took for him to get there, some naked people walking around was trying to distract the audience, while playing a really annoying soundtrack. A movie about STD : Sexually Transmitted Demon<br/><br/>If I could give this movie 0/10 i would... SORRY Don't WATCH, waste of time."
"FubarSFBD","1","102","226","20 May 2015"," utter bore fest
","It Follows was a complete bore fest, lacking any scares or script cohesiveness, sprinkled heavily with horrible acting, low budget sets, wanna-be-cool-like-the-70s-slasher-classics soundtrack that only comes off as annoying, and an absolutely anti climactic finish. If you believe this movie was anything above 3/10 you are either related to the cast, a mentally deranged imbecile or some hipster ""pretendo"". Putting this title in the same sentence with The Exorcist, Halloween, The Shining, or even completely mediocre modern horror movies like Insidious (yes, Insidious is also highly overrated, but compared to this crap it looks like Citizen Kane) offends me as a human being and makes me question the credibility of IMDb's and Rotten Tomatoes's rating system. Avoid!"
"BenjaminRaymond","8","13","22","19 February 2016"," ""It Follows"" masters and massacres the horror genre
","It's early autumn, dusk in a residential neighborhood in suburban Detroit. A teenage girl in red stilettos sprints out her front door and into the middle of the street. Her heels click-clacking across the pavement, she slows and turns back towards her house, terrified. She's being chased. But nothing's there. Moments later, she begins running again, the camera panning in a circle, following her back through her own front door as her father runs out to help. She runs out again, hops in the family car, and peels out down the street. <br/><br/>Jump cut to the shores of Lake St. Clair. The girl sits with her back to the water, illuminated by headlights, and phones her dad to say she's sorry, and that she loves him. She's accepted that ""it"" will kill her. She can see it. But we cannot. What follows is one of the more grisly and unsympathetic images you will ever see put to screen.<br/><br/>This is the opening scene of writer-director David Robert Mitchell's ""It Follows,"" a contemporary horror film of simply monumental intelligence and artistry, one that celebrates and satirizes in equal measure the conventions of the sex-as-death, teen-victim horror flick, which began with such promise in John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" nearly four decades ago. Our heroine is seventeen-year-old Jay Height, who consummates her relationship with new boyfriend Hugh in the spacious backseat of his well-manicured, chocolate- brown Plymouth sedan. As Jay basks in the post-coital glow of unprotected boning, Jake silently approaches her from behind and subdues her with chloroform. When she wakes, Jay is roped to a wheelchair beneath an overpass. Hugh apologizes and explains that something will now follow her, wherever she goes. Someone gave ""it"" to him, and he gave ""it"" to her, by having sex with her back in the car. ""It"" can look like anything. Even someone she knows. But only she can see it. It moves slowly, but is always getting closer. And if it catches her, it will kill herunless she passes it on to someone else, just like Hugh did back in the car.<br/><br/>Mitchell takes the ""sex will kill you"" trope of slasher films and conservative dads literally. Have sex, and you die. ""It"" is always on your mind, ""it"" follows you everywhere, ""it"" is passed on to someone else like chlamydia. And ""it"" can't be destroyed. Mitchell's ""it""—whatever ""it"" is—is the monstrous and literal anthropomorphization of our most basic drives: to escape death, to Netflix, and to chill. ""It"" is unstoppable, all-consuming, and inevitable. But even if you don't appreciate or much care about the film's insights into Freudian psychology, you'll appreciate how ""It Follows"" all at once masters and massacres the entirety of its genre. No trope or standard of cheap slash-horror is safe from Mitchell's brilliant and often comic satire. <br/><br/>In ""It Follows,"" sex kills you; more sex kills others. The monster crawls at a snail's pace, but somehow you can't outrun it. All our heroes are beautiful, and essentially quite stupid. The heroine is helpless and blonde. Her love-interest is talldarkhandsome and, of course, irresistibly misunderstood. The string-beany, friend-zoned nerd tries in vain to save and bang the damsel in distress—not necessarily in that order. Parents are inexplicably absent. The kids never seem to go to school. They watch shitty horror films and talk about screwing. They make poor decisions, back themselves into corners, and turn their backs on danger. ""It Follows"" is, in every conceivable respect, a horror film ABOUT horror films.<br/><br/>Mitchell crafts a horror film that is in equal measure a love letter and scathing editorial of the genre itself. His direction is exacting, heavy on slow movement and zooms, 360- (even 720- degree) panning long-takes, and compositions that draw the viewer's attention deep, deep into the background, ominous and drenched in panic. The film's shrieking and concussive, synthy and discordant score from Rich Vreeland (of Disasterpeace) delivers half the film's terror by itself. Genuinely unsettling, surprisingly funny (if you know what it's really\ doing), and properly frightening, ""It Follows"" is smart, unconventional, intensely atmospheric and, most importantly, utterly self-aware. <br/><br/>""It Follows"" knows exactly what it's doing. Its jump-scares are cheap (the funniest is nothing more than a dodge ball hitting a window). Its monster is slow and stupid. Its heroes are only slightly faster, and somehow even stupider. Everything about ""It Follows"" screams intelligence, foresight, and self-awareness. And that includes the much-maligned final act. <br/><br/>Many worthwhile critics, most of whom actually like the film, have criticized its climactic swimming-pool face-off for being more of a letdown than a showdown. The teens' plan is as intricate as it is moronic. Their strategy is to have Jay swim in the center of a high-school pool (during a thunderstorm, mind you), and line its edges with electrical appliances plugged into sockets surrounding the entire pool. There, they wait for ""it"" to approach and wade into the pool after Jay, whereupon they will toss the lamps and toasters and Forman Grills into the water and electrocute ""it"" to death. Sounds moronic, doesn't it? And that's the point, folks. That's the damn point. It's moronic because our heroesare morons. Like most teens, these teens don't think things through. They think they're invincible. They don't think they need help. They try to do everything on their own, and often fail disastrously. And teens in horror films are the worst of all teens in this respect. So, while I have no argument with any critic or casual viewer who isn't taken with the film for reasons of personal taste, I hold no quarter with those who critique it for reasons of internal logic. Because, I'm sorry, folks, if you think the climax is stupid because it's stupid, you've missed the point entirely. The climax of this horror film is galactically stupid because its heroes are teens in a horror film and are, as evergalactically stupid. And that, my friends, is smart."

","I would recommend this film to anyone who is nostalgic about the 80's style horror movies. It is truly a fresh and new approach compared to the other horror films nowadays which contain many predictable jump-scares and clichés. And of course when I was watching it I thought to myself how well the music suits with the overall style of this particular piece. And as I now looked at the budget and how much it received revenue on the opening week and in gross, I think it is really underrated. I saw the trailer of it in the cinema some days ago but then I learned that it was released already relatively long time ago so I watched it right away,"

"Screen_Blitz","9","11","18","26 July 2016"," A scary, clever ignition of the horror genre
","After the a long series of horror films that failed to leave a lasting impression on the horror genre, it comes almost explicitly clear that the horror genre is running scarce of ideas. Thus, the genre is found lost in the sea of old, tiresome clichés that have long overstayed their welcome. This is until director David Robert Mitchell steps in the game to deliver this psychological horror-thriller sparked with one of the most original ideas of the genre brought in recent memory. Devoid of nearly every overused trope including terrorizing paranormal entities, masked killers wielding a bladed weapon, and flesh-eating zombies, this movie formulates an all-new original concept that some can interpret as an allegory of the AIDS epidemic that went viral in the 1980s, a deadly virus transmitted to teenagers through engagement of sexual activity and renders them into a dangerous life-threatening situation. With little works under his belt other than the 2011 coming-of-age drama 'The Myth of The American Sleepover', David Robert Mitchell takes the director's chair in this horror flick starring Maika Monroe as Jay, a young college girl who goes out on a date with her boyfriend Hugh (played by Jake Weary) which leads to intimate sexual encounter. Soon, when Jay becomes experiencing some terrifying hallucinations, she learns her life in mortal danger. Her escape from the dreadful virus is to pass over the virus to another individual via sexual intercourse.<br/><br/>David Robert Mitchell succeeds in energizes this film with not only generating all-new concept but also executing it in an effective manner. This task involves taking the typical ""only virgins survive"" trope common in the slasher genre (Halloween, Scream for example) and expanding upon it. Rather pounding the audience with constant sight scares and jump scenes, the film conveys it's scare factor by building up it's dark, eerie atmosphere through slick character development and the revolving fear of the characters battling against the horrors of this sexually transmitted virus. Though the plot's slow pace can be frustrating for the impatient viewers, Mitchell succeeds on making the concept work. But the scares are the only the film's high caliber. The movie was filmed on location in an old tranquil neighborhood in Detroit and uses vintage synthesized music score common by Disaster Peace that pay effective homages to the horror classics from the 70s and 80s. As a result, viewers are presented with what feels like a retro horror flick. The music score succeeds on only obtaining a retro feel for the film but also constructing it's true eerie atmosphere. Aside from all this, the cast shows off some great performances, particularly Maika Monroe as the steamy scream queen serving the center role in the story. Are the performances very memorable? Not really, but certainly work.<br/><br/>It Follows is a fresh, stunning addition to the horror genre that introduces a fresh new idea to the category with fresh performances, spectacular direction by David Robert Mitchell, and an overall solid execution of a newborn concept. The chances of this becoming a horror classic are hard to say at this point but it is definitely a must-watch for all horror fans looking for something new."
"ValeriaTyagnorenko","2","21","39","21 February 2016"," Not for everyone
","This review might contain spoilers and might offend you.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say it is a bad movie, but it wasn't a horror movie. I probably had too high expectations for this, because it is praised as one of the best new horror movies. I don't agree with that, just because I never had the feeling of ""horror"" while watching it.<br/><br/>The plot wasn't very engaging for me, personally. SPOILERS: it's basically about a demon STD (probably? we never know what it even is?) final destination style. If it kills you, it goes after the person which was infected with it before you. It follows the kids (one girl, actually) for the rest of the movie. The plot twist? It is only able to walk. On foot. You can basically drive away from it and wait until it gets to you. On foot. This opens a question: what if you just fly overseas? But that's no possible solution to this problem. No. You better sleep around to pass it to someone else. The kids don't even ask themselves the question WHAT this thing even is. Maybe they could have found a solution to get rid of it somehow? But no, sleep with someone to get this unexplained thing off of you. What else can you do.<br/><br/>The characters were not relatable at all. The teenagers never really talk about anything substantial, so you don't even get to know them, besides seeing them as some kind of hip nerd kids living in the modern age with TVs from the 70s. They also have ebook readers in the shape of a seashell and old, rusty cars. Aesthetics.<br/><br/>Don't even get me started on the soundtrack. I know some people praise the OST for being ""old school 80s horror"". But I don't know how to take a horror movie seriously if there is bad synthesizer music in almost every shot, ruining any built up mood completely.<br/><br/>Sometimes the movie was very pretty to look at. It was, after all, all about aesthetics. And sometimes there was a really disturbing jumpscare which reminded you of the fact that it was, indeed, supposed to be a horror movie. But other than that, the movie was not enjoyable.<br/><br/>The critique comes from a person who loves synth pop, watches aesthetic shows like Hannibal, where nothing much happens for the sake of pretty shots, and is, herself, a geeky young adult, same as the characters in this movie. But, even though these aspects stand greatly on their own, they don't go together in this movie and just make it feel ridiculous.<br/><br/>I am sorry if this review offended your opinion overall or specifically on this movie. You can explain it to me, maybe I will understand the point of this movie better afterwards."
"volt93","9","38","77","6 June 2015"," A Truly Grasping Horror Film
","This movie might not be for everyone. It Follows is a story of Jay, a girl who is haunted by ""It"". Some people do not agree that it's scary, I think it's scarier than most horror movies nowadays. It's closer with style to Rosemary's Baby or Jacob's Ladder than say Insidious. The style of the movie is very psychological, it refers to a fear of being haunted and the unsettling feeling that follows, that someone watches you. The music by Disasterpeace is absolutely brilliant and fits perfectly to this eerie film. The way this movie is shot is also superb. Mainly dark colours, high definition and no unnecessary slow motion effects and very few effects for that matter. One of the most important films for the genre of the last few years."

","This is as metaphorical as The Babadook, as paranoid as The Ring, and as hard hitting as Fight Club.

I have myself written and produced many scripts, music and books on the same subject and from different angles (excuse the pun), some published, but I have always met opposition on many levels when trying to delve in and explain this phenomenon. Be it from financiers not daring to touch the subject or be it from horrified parents. I feel like the best piece of fiction in any medium ever ever ever has been done here, and so done is also my own work. A weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I can now find new horrors in modern society to try and shine light on. I can now find peace.

"schroeder-gustavo","8","37","75","26 June 2015"," Takes from the best, to become one of the best
","I won't say It Follows is a horror movie like no other, nor will I say that it is original, because it's really not: it is a film that recycles many ideas that have existed for many years and, at times, just borrows these shamelessly. But It Follows does this in a very cool way and comes off not as a cheap copy of Halloween, but as a movie that pays homage to slasher classics of the late 1970's and 80's, like Halloween. <br/><br/>In the first 10 seconds of the movie, if someone were to ask me if I was watching It Follows or Halloween, I would probably have a hard time guessing. But, like I said It Follows can copy these ideas like Tarantino could copy Leone: it has its own style that pays homage to the original. There is one scene in the movie where Jay is sitting in the classroom and gets bored and looks out the window...for those of you fond of horror movies, you know where this is going. I also love that they explain that IT cannot run, it can only walk (just like Michael Myers). The soundtrack of the movie also has that 80's vibe and fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the film. <br/><br/>It Follows does an amazing job at creating tension throughout and being able to scare you, without an abundance of cheap jump-scares, although I counted two unnecessary ones in the movie (ball hitting the window, for example). The movie is flawed in the sense that I think one or two things don't make a lot of sense, like the ball hitting the window when Jay is in the bathroom was completely unnecessary and another thing when you see IT on the roof of the house for no apparent reason whatsoever...how the hell did he get there in the first place? Also, when Jay takes the car to the woods all by herself, why in the world would she sleep on top of the car instead of inside where the doors and windows are locked if something wants to kill you? Stuff like that just makes me cringe cause the movie could have been more.<br/><br/>I don't want to sound too negative, cause I really enjoyed It Follows. One of the things I enjoyed the most was Maika Monroe's performance in the movie, which was excellent. Overall, I believe It Follows is definitely not for everyone, not a movie made for general audiences, but if you can appreciate the tribute to classic slasher films like Halloween and keep an open mind to clever ideas, It Follows is a solid horror film that I look forward to owning in my horror collection."
"IanAJohnson","7","37","75","8 June 2015"," This film was very suspenseful and had a great premise.
","It Follows is a small horror and suspense film vaguely about a haunted S.T.D and the young woman that has to avoid the inevitable consequences of a supernatural presence. There is a small set of rules that the horror behind the film follows. There is a being that targets a single person and stalks them at a slow, yet constant pace. This presence never stops, and cannot be killed. It has the ability to change its appearance at will to any person it finds suitable. It is possible to change its target by having its current target have sex with someone else, making the other person the new target. Only the current target and those who have been the target before can see this being. Once the presence reaches the target, stuff will happen and it will then go back down the line and stalk the previous target. The beauty of this concept is that the protagonist is never safe and always on the run. This gives the entire film a natural drive and constant sense of dread. While this is technically a horror film I wouldn't call it scary. It was very suspenseful and I was on the edge of my seat for most of the film, but I didn't have any trouble sleeping after I saw it. The over all structure of the film is built upon small scenes that jump from location to location with a heavy metaphorical overtone and lots of silent and subtle moments. While some might call the film slow and jumbled. I found it's slowness to be an effective building of tension and its many short scenes make predicting when this being would actually show up very difficult. This sense of overwhelming fear is made even more effective by slow, yet long takes and some really good cinematography. I have very few problems with the plot. The first issue is that there is a heavy reliance on metaphor, and so much of the plot is subtly told that the possibility of missing something is incredibly high. I do respect that the creators of the film expect the audience to pay attention, but there needs to be some straightforward foundation to build metaphors on or else they can be interpreted in so may ways that people will get lost at times. On the other hand, not finding these metaphors still leaves a straightforward and simple plot, but there is a complex plot hidden inside that allow of people will miss on the first viewing. This might not even be a flaw to some people. One final nitpick is that the parents in this film are almost never seen and never directly interact with the plot. While this might be a throwback to older horror classics it is a trope that I think needs to go away. I still do recommend watching this movie. I was constantly on edge and the subtle storytelling kept me focused and interested."

The choice they make at the end is somewhat telegraphed in but well acceptable and had me wondering: Why didn't they do that sooner?<br/><br/>Well, they'd have spoiled the rest of the film then wouldn't they.<br/><br/>All in all a perfect example of a movie that didn't require a billion dollar production budget with massive digital effects and Dolby quadraphonic bionic sound artifices to achieve the desired effect: Scare the viewer."
"brandorres","10","37","75","6 May 2015"," It Follows REVIEW by @killfillm on Instagram
","**VERY MINOR SPOILERS IN LAST PARAGRAPH**<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>IT FOLLOWS .<br/><br/>Written & Directed by David Robert Mitchell .<br/><br/>So horror movies are part of what makes me able to function in everyday life and after 2014 being a not so great year for horror....I needed something bad. If it weren't for Oculus and The Babadook I probably wouldn't have made it to 2015. After all I've heard about this, my expectations were high. Well, It Follows surpassed my already extremely high expectations by a mile.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>So It Follows is about Jay, a sweet girl who has sex with a guy, and after having sex he reveals what he just got her into. This monster, demon, supernatural force, STD, whatever ""IT"" is hunts you down and kills you. The only way to get rid of IT is to pass it on by having sex, but you'll never be rid of it. It will just follow down the line and eventually IT will be after you. IT can be anyone anywhere, IT doesn't stop, IT Follows.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>This is one of the most unique and coolest horror movies I've ever seen. David Mitchell, the directing was pure insanity. Its masterful. Every single shot looks like a beautiful painting. The cinematography in this is straight Eye Porn. The score, probably one of my favorite scores of all time. The musical score in It Follows defined and made the movie. Without it this movie wouldn't have been as great. Maika Monroe was phenomenal and all her teenage friends were too and all really likable. Which is different because usually when there's a group of teens in a horror movie they're 25yr old college jocks and whores who have half a brain and just want to have sex in the Woods. It Follows dodged every cliché and made a very likable group of characters, that actually looked like teenagers, with an incredible story. What I really love about this, although it's a horror, it feels a lot like a terrifying adventure that you're on, but you're just hanging out with these cool people adventuring place to place as they run from IT. It's not the scariest film ever, but it's very suspenseful and thrilling and there were scenes that were completely terrifying.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Is it a perfect film? No. The way it is marketed and the way ""IT"" is in the film, ""it doesn't think. It doesn't stop. It doesn't give up."" Well, there's a point in the film where they break their own code. ""IT"" thinks. Without spoiling....the pool scene. Also, the ending was a bit disappointing to me. This may be a bit of a spoiler so if you haven't seen it just skip to the grade at the bottom: the way it ended, I feel like they never really made any progress the entire movie. Like they started at Point A, and by the end, they were still at Point A and I wanted to see them get to Point B. All that said,this was still a very unique horror movie, and its one of the best horrors i've seen in years. If you're not a horror fan, the cinematography and score alone make this worth a watch.<br/><br/>It Follows gets an: A .<br/><br/>Follow me on Instagram @KillFillm for more Movie Reviews!"

","Let's get the frustrations out of the way. First, when someone breaks into your house call the police. When something happens, TELL someone. That's the horror mantra that It Follows pursues. But I DO understand why they wouldn't tell. No one would believe them. Because as everyone knows, It is only seen by the chain of sexual adventures from one person to another. <br/><br/>The characters all seem to have parental issues and have wrapped themselves in their own world, with hardly a care of being caught for things like smoking or even casual sex. And that is the worst of it. The kids are on their own to deal with a monster that pursues someone who had sex with another that It had been pursuing. The religious references usually seen in films is abandoned too. What would YOU do if you suddenly see yourself pursued by It, and no one else sees It? <br/><br/>This is a good concept, and the film is left with questions that beg for a sequel. Will there ever be a cure or action to stop It? Why does It follow? And, just what is It? I certainly hope as the filmmakers pursue making sequels and/or prequels to It, that they explain some things. I did wonder if this is some veiled attempt to morality-preach, as there was no religion or family structure whatsoever. And the film took place in a city of complete and utter decay, symbolizing that perhaps, whatever people touch is doomed. <br/><br/>It Follows seems like a cat, or brussels sprouts: you either like it or absolutely hate it. It goes against how young people trend: the film shows them embracing all things retro and rejecting technological things - no Facebook friends in this film. That seems like a gamble, since most of the generation are about Twitter and Instagram. Anyway, I enjoyed it enough to hope for a follow-up film to learn what IT is all about."

","This movie can be a real nightmare for some people. After a long time i finally found something interesting in Horror genre. It Follows is an unnerving and insane horror film with an explosive climax that will leave you buzzed upon leaving the Theater! It Follows is probably one of the most creepiest movie I've seen in a long time or i can say after ""RING"".<br/><br/>The plot is simple. Girl gets a PSTD from having unprotected sex with a guy, which causes her to be chased by ghosts only she can see. She must have sex to pass on the PSTD, but once the ghost kills the new carrier it will come back for her. So what makes this movie so good? The atmosphere. The sets, the music, the clothing and i believe everything.<br/><br/>I can dare you to watch this alone at night. As an avid horror fan i very much hope director will be bringing us some more scary films. There are too many horror films these days that follow similar themes and ideas so its so refreshing to see something new and different. This film breathes new life into the horror genre.... Go see it. You wont be disappointed."
"jonathan-clark-52-587350","3","24","46","6 September 2015"," It Sucked
","This movie was one of the worst horror films I have ever seen. All but a few scenes were not scary. I love the ""BOO"" kind of scare not the ""following"" type. Those few scenes that were scary included the first girl (Annie) at the beginning and the part when Greg was killed. Other scenes throughout the movie were not as frightening. I cannot believe other people rated this movie higher. I hate to say it, but they are all wrong. I rather see people get eaten or have their souls sucked than be stalked. Better yet, add younger children to make it more terrifying. Last but not least, I would like to point out that the music throughout the film also sucked."
"Prairie_Wolf","1","132","303","1 April 2015"," Ghastly - Not Ghostly or Even Remotely Scary
","I have never given a movie a 1 star rating until I saw this film today. No spoilers to be addressed, as there was nothing to spoil - the movie was already fatally flawed. Faint story line from start to finish, and not a single moment where I felt scared, haunted, afraid or any of the other things one expects while watching a horror movie. There was some nudity, sprinkled with mild sex scenes, for those who care. And, I had to wonder where they filmed the movie; jokingly saying it must have been Chernobyl, as so much of the area filmed looked like it had been abandoned after an apocalyptic event - peopled with humans who appeared zombie-like. Plus, it would seem the movie-makers obtained most of their set material from 1970-1980's secondhand stores. Odd, that! And not in keeping with the time period of the film.<br/><br/>All-in-all, very disappointing. As my spouse and I exited the theater, we heard negative comments from the total, small handful of movie-goers in attendance, as they were leaving, too."

"timbaaland","8","34","69","22 April 2015"," Perfect? Hardly. Entertaining? Absolutely.
","Independent movie hits are few and far between. It usually takes a Hollywood marketing machine to churn out a box office success. But occasionally, an independent film hits the mainstream based off of its own merits and garners a following, securing a place in pop culture history and usually boosting the profile of its stars and creators. Good examples of this are Pulp Fiction, Clerks, Good Will Hunting and My Big Fat Greek Wedding.<br/><br/>A particular genre of film where independent movies can have a good chance of capturing a large audience is that of horror. Entire franchises, sub-genres and mountains of revenue have been spawned from the horror genre. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street are all, by definition, independent films. New Line Cinema, the studio behind Elm Street, is often referred to as ""the house that Freddy built"", going from an unheard of studio before Elm Street's success to one that would eventually be responsible for theatrical juggernauts like The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>With that said, a good bet for an independent film to garner high success with little budget is in this genre, and the most recent example of said success is a film titled It Follows. It Follows puts a new spin on the psychological thriller or boogeyman sub-genres by opting for a villain that any conscious and sexually-active human being would be wary of. The story revolves around a vicious entity that will pursue its victim until it catches them and devours them, and the only way to escape from it is to ""pass it on"", so to speak, by sexually transferring it to another victim. Imagine an STD in the form of a relentless killer, and you've got the plot for the film, as ludicrous, yet entertaining, as it sounds.<br/><br/>With such an imaginably silly premise, one might be quick to write off It Follows as just another cash-grab in the genre. The opposite is the case, however, once you've viewed the film. One thing that is apparent from director David Robert Mitchell is that he is clearly a respectful fan of horror and litters homages and nods to the pioneering films that made something like this possible. The musical score to It Follows feels like it was composed by John Carpenter or was borrowed from a 70s grindhouse offering. Little nuances like this give the film credibility by its audience for a terrifying, yet fun experience.<br/><br/>The screenwriter, also Mitchell, is trying to evoke the real human emotion of fear of disease with a physical manifestation. He pulls it off rather brilliantly, creating a Grim Reaper-like adversary that is born of a poor decision in fidelity. The message is one that resonates with any sexually active person of being cautious of what you get yourself into, because it could ruin your life, or even worse, kill you.<br/><br/>Upon finishing the film, it leaves you with a strange comprehension of what you have just seen. While flawed, it certainly executes in the areas where it needs to in order to connect with its audience. If questioning whether the film was worth doing, I would say that any film that keeps you thinking into the next day is one that was worth it, and It Follows accomplishes that wonderfully. From a financial standpoint it was certainly worth the production, as it started in 4 theaters and has managed to work itself through perseverance and word-of-mouth into a much wider release, more than quadrupling its $2 million budget back. It would be an understatement to call the film successful.<br/><br/>Using an unknown cast of actors was definitely the right choice for It Follows. For the most part, the characters appear believable and the lack of big names keeps the film grounded. The main girl, Jay, played by Maika Monroe, is a good example of how an unknown actor can carry a role on their shoulders and blossom the film into a believable territory, regardless of how far-fetched the plot may get. The macabre tone of the film and the heightened terror that the cast experiences is conveyed on a very primal but professional level that leaves the viewer enticed, anxious, and most importantly, scared. While none of the performances are Oscar-worthy, for the horror genre, they are very well-portrayed.<br/><br/>Is It Follows the scariest film to come out in recent years? Very arguably. Will it go down as a classic of the genre? Probably not. The most important question, however, is if you see it, will it keep you up at night? If you believe that a film can haunt you, then yes, prepare to save a section of your thought-process to ponder over this new type of boogeyman."

This movie is that stupid I have no more idea what to write about it.In the opening scene, a young woman is fleeing from someone or something. She is shown driving to the beach. At the beach, she calls her father and tells him that she's sorry for being so unkind to him. In the morning, it is shown that she was brutally murdered during the night. Her leg is twisted and a bone is seen sticking out of it. That was probably the best scene in the whole movie."
"kieranbattams","8","33","67","27 February 2015"," Horror is going back to its roots!
","Until this week It Follows was a film I hadn't even heard of, then I saw the overwhelming attention it had received and I actually felt like this would be a horror film that my stick with me, turns out I was right, this is the best horror experience since The Babadook and it truly terrified me, in fact as I am writing this review I am getting shivers because it is a film that relies on psychological horror rather than jump scares (it had one or two but they were well executed at least), and the more I think about it, the more I like it.<br/><br/>The film follows Jay, who is a girl who has everything going for her, until a sexual encounter changes everything. A curse was passed to her like a sexually transmitted disease and the only way she can get rid of this curse is by sleeping with somebody else. As the film progresses Jay is plagued by zombie-like imagery of people she knows and loves that only she is able to see and it makes for some skin-crawlingly scary scenes. The way the plot sounds doesn't make the film sound like it is anything special and i have to admit the plot synopsis on IMDb didn't make me want to rush out and see the film, but I am very glad I did.<br/><br/>Horror films recently have been tripe, back in the 70s and 80s we had classic horror such as The Evil Dead and A Nightmare on Elm Street among others, these films were heavily reliant on psycholgical and creepy imagery that really did work. More recently we have had a slew of films that have just been jump scares thrown into a sequence of events and called a film.. Prime examples of recent films are Annabelle and The Woman In Black Angel of Death.. neither of these films worked as horror and I found myself more bored than creeped out. Then I saw an awesome film called The Babadook which really made me feel like good horror still exists, I don't want to compare this film to The Babadook too much but I found them to be similar in the way that they both scared the living daylights out of me and had me thinking about them long after seeing them. I cannot remember the last time I felt that way about horror, but with these examples I believe with some more work horror cinema will get back to the way it once was.<br/><br/>In the end It Follows is a well acted (especially the main actress who was believable and a pleasure to watch) and downright creepy film that I would definitely recommend to anybody who is a horror fan. The cinematography really shone and the soundtrack was terrifyingly awesome, the score is still in my head and i guarantee after seeing this you will walk out of the cinema and will be really conscious of the people around you. Never will I look at an old lady behind me again without thinking she is going to follow and murder me for her own amusement. It also has what most horrors don't nowadays which is an INCREDIBLY intense climax. I was on the edge of my seat gripping my girlfriend's hand tight in suspense until the very end. <br/><br/>One of the gripes I do have is that the ending did kind of suck and was so abrupt that I don't know exactly how I feel about it, although I can see why it was done in this way. Now if you will excuse me there is a creepy lady walking towards me and I have to run, looks like this will be a sleepless night."

The writer and director was David Robert Mitchell who, in my opinion, needs to work on his craft a bit more before attempting to write and direct another movie of any kind.

","The plot is simple yet interesting. Someone has sex with someone else and an STD monster stalks them. It walks like a Romero-esque zombie but no matter how far you travel, it keeps coming for you. If it touches you, you're dead. If it kills you, it goes after whoever passed the curse to you. I don't feel like this is a spoiler because they basically explain it in the first twenty minutes of the film.<br/><br/>I had heard it was good and although it had its flaws, it was pretty cool. Yeah, the parents seem to be absent (so were mine) and yes, the rules are bent slightly here and there but I mean, were you expecting The Godfather? It's a stupid horror film. If you can believe in an STD monster, your suspension of disbelief should probably allow your brain to fill in the blanks and get passed the glitches of the film. In short, get over it. It's entertaining and it's more thought out than anything Michael Bay has pumped out...ever.<br/><br/>I think this is one of the better horror films of the decade (not the best,) considering it's up against the 15th Saw flick (only the 10th since the villain died,) Paranormal Conjuring Nuns that Purge and all its spin offs and various other PG-13 ""scary movies"" as well as a countless barrage of remakes and sequels. At least this film is different and had some balls (it's rated R.) Not great, but worth watching.

","I'll list the good and bad I felt this movie had. As a low budget horror movie, I can understand the limits, but I've seen a lot of low budget horror movies that excelled, while this one.. <br/><br/>I'm giving out spoilers in this so be prepared.<br/><br/>Good: - The actors were good at their roles, I felt some sense of investment in the main character, Jay, her relationship with her sister, her childhood friend who has puppy love for her, and the guy across the street. Jay was a genuinely likable character who you felt bad for having to go though all this. - The cinematography. It felt like the theme of drawing back to 80s, movies like Halloween and Friday the 13s in terms of camera angles and panning the camera around, it borrowed from that era and seemed to do an okay job of it.<br/><br/>Bad: - The story was just ridiculous, the theme that whoever someone has sex with, the curse of whatever this demon/monster thing is will stalk them, until they have sex with someone and pass the curse on. This is taken direct from themes like the Ring, but in a less intimidating. The setup is suppose to make you think of the unknown, but when the main character can see it slowing coming at them, its not unknown, and far less scary. - The cheap jump scares, as any cheap attempt at horror, it has a few moments that just break all tension, and without any payoff. - The music in this SUUUUUUUCK! I know its a low budget movie, but the audio just ruins so many tense scenes and just makes them laughable. - The ending. On of the most pointless endings I've seen, as it leads nowhere, no sense of satisfaction at all. <br/><br/>I believe Doug Walker said it best, the problem with this movie, is its trying to make an artsy movie, out of a stock slasher horror movie, and the two just don't gel together. <br/><br/>I give this movie an E for effort, as in they tried to make a good horror movie, they had a smart idea, they had good actors on board, but it just failed with the writing, music and ending. <br/><br/>Don't pay full price for this movie, if you can get it free from a friend or cheap download then maybe, but for all the rave reviews people gave this, I just want my money back."

","Any horror fans out there? This one comes highly recommended. It borrows heavily from the masters of the genre but yet it manages to do it intelligently. Made for only 2mil but it looks like it was made for 5 times that amount. Good horror is like a needle in a haystack. This is good horror.<br/><br/>The premise sounds dumb - a terrible curse is transmitted through sex. The supernatural entity will then come for the unfortunate person in any human-like form to kill him/her. You can't stop the curse, you can only propagate the curse by having sex with another person, but if this new person dies the supernatural force will then come for you and work up the food chain. Dumb right? But the execution is pure masterclass.<br/><br/>If you didn't already catch the allegory, let me tell you that the writer-director is ""metaphorizing"" STD. This one is going to make you think twice about having casual sex. The subtext doesn't become full-on distracting winks at you but does enough to get under your skin.<br/><br/>The characters are not over-written and easily relatable. The atmosphere is nail-biting and the unnamed dread is killer. The tension builds and builds to a point that it becomes a visceral force. The music soundtrack hearkens back to the electronic scores of John Carpenter and it really creeps me out. This is lo-fi horror but it is buoyed by the Mother of hi-fi power, with just a teaspoon of blood. It is horror that doesn't scream in your face but makes you scream inside your head for days.<br/><br/>PS - I saw this on blu-ray in the comfort of my home. Nothing beats watching horror movies at home. When I soil and pee in my pants, nothing beats the convenience."

The first half of the movie was good, Then at the half way mark it was like they changed Directors...and the New Director didn't bother to watch the first half of the movie.

","In a sea of crappy modern horror titles that rely on cheap jump- scare tactics, over the top gore and casts of unrealistic, super model- esque people, ""It Follows"" takes you back to a time when horror films had a suffocating atmosphere that made you genuinely uncomfortable, a menacing killer/being that was actually unnerving without having to brutally butcher everyone in sight, as well as characters that look and act like real people (most of the time). Also, the soundtrack is memorable, namely the theme, which in my opinion right up there with the Halloween theme and the Nightmare On Elm St. theme, I get chills every time I hear it. <br/><br/>Maybe there are a few people who genuinely don't like this movie, but I'm willing to bet that most of them aren't actually that into horror movies or prefer the modern horror dribble over the classics. Most of the people hating on this film probably didn't even give it a chance, pre-determining their opinions based on the misguided mindset that ""no modern horror movie can be good"", which simply isn't true, as most people seem to think."

","Jay has backseat sex with odd boyfriend Hugh, at which point he reveals to her that he has passed on a kind of curse: Jay will be pursued by some sort of entity which only she can see, which has in mind killing her brutally (as we have seen in an opening sequence). It only walks, so she can speed away from it in a variety of ways, but it never stops. She can pass on this curse by having sex with someone else: if it kills them then it reverts back to her and so on, back down the line. Her disbelieving friends are, nevertheless, supportive.<br/><br/>I have watched quite a lot of horror films over the years, and it is unusual to encounter one which is a little bit different. It Follows is a very simple concept (as someone else has pointed out, it is about a sexually transmitted haunting), and is delivered well. The opening sequence shows that the director is not afraid to present graphically explicit gore on screen: the rest of the film shows that he doesn't feel it necessary to do so. And quite rightly. He has created a ""monster"" which generates the same dread as Schwarzenegger's Terminator in the original movie – an unemotional and unstoppable entity, nightmarishly implacable, and intent on nothing at all other than the destruction of our sympathetic protagonist.<br/><br/>There are several effective set pieces, set in and around some of Detroit's less salubrious areas (even the residential area where Jay lives is unlikely to feature in Detroit Tourist Board commercials), and the general drabness adds to the pessimistic and downbeat air of the movie, as does the unsettling music, not to mention the three sex scenes which are all equally unlovely and unloving. The unknown cast all do very well.<br/><br/>I can see this garnering some criticism for its relatively leisurely pace and for the absence of much in the way of in-your-face horror trimmings: such criticisms are likely to come from the modern generation who demand up-front explicitness, which is not what this film is about at all.<br/><br/>I look forward to a sequel which, I hope, will explore the origin of this curse."

"DVR_Brale","8","5","7","9 August 2016"," ""The Shining"" + ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" = ""It Follows""
","What a dichotomy between professional critics and general audience. I'm starting to think professional critics exist for a reason - they surely provide much deeper insight to this movie than almost anyone commenting ""It Follows'""message boards.<br/><br/>As I was reading message boards I quickly realized a few people came to know what ""It"" really presents. This is a horror movie which, if watched superficially, doesn't give much impression. This is not ""SAW"" type of a movie. This is more like Kubrick's ""The Shining"" masterpiece which had a major impact on director David Robert Mitchell in making of ""It Follows"".<br/><br/>So if you were able to enjoy and more importantly understand ""The Shining"" you're be able to enjoy ""It Follows"". This is primarily a psychological horror movie.<br/><br/>So what is the point of the movie? What does ""It"" represent? If you want to figure that on you own, stop reading now. ""It"" is the metaphor for emotional scars caused by family and sexual partners. ""It"" is not a super-natural entity but a real emotional struggle which exists solely inside someone's heart and mind. How do you make a movie when you want to bring closer all the ugly pain which intoxicates us the from inside and keeps attacking like a monster almost never fading out? You make a super-natural surreal mystery movie which focuses more on giving you chills and making you feeling really unpleasant than making you jump.<br/><br/>And that's why critics are right: ""It Follows"" is exceedingly dreadful experience. Distorted 90's synthesizer music ads much to the dreadful ambient. Soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard. Camera work and all other gimmicks, including acting, are on the expected level for a two million dollar budget movie. But these are really not important - music, concept and ambient is what furnishes unpleasant feelings and makes ""It Follows"" a decent ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" plus ""The Shining"" spin-off.<br/><br/>In conclusion: this movie is a valuable contribution to discussion on how sexual relationships can bring about bad feelings. If you're looking for a quaint and disturbing movie experience which covers a most serious topic, there you have it. Don't read message boards and don't take rating seriously. It might steer you away from a gem."

","Common to what you find in today's cinema, it's a poor movie that uses hipsteresque elements to draw attention to itself.<br/><br/>-The soundtrack: it is a mix of retro-wave garbage and poor synth sound fx. The main highlight is that the composer drenches the soundtrack with that iconic cs-80 sound that you would immediately remember from Blade Runner. I found the soundtrack to be grating, not to mention inappropriate for the nature of the movie. It just plain fit wrong.<br/><br/>-The main story: This is the one good aspect of the movie, as it's actually a clever premise. The movie is basically a hybrid ripoff of both The Ring and Halloween - which doesn't necessarily make for a bad thing. The problems arise from the fact that the narrative does not measure up to the quality of the premise; the story plot points are dull and feel lazy and cheap, and all of the characters amount to being mysterious bystanders. The writer/director shrouds some elements in mystery, but ultimately I lost interest or concern for any of it by the final conclusion.<br/><br/>-The cinematography: I found the cinematography to be gimmicky and ultimately dull. It, like the soundtrack, amounted to an additional distraction and annoyance to the rest of the package. More than once there was a full 180-degree pan, which served no purpose. There were lots of long-shots that perplexed me, as they served no purpose for what was taking place.<br/><br/>-The location: It was filmed in Detroit, and it felt uninspired. Random scenes in abandoned(?) houses and buildings seemed to be more about showing the structures, rather than advancing the story ...<br/><br/>That is all"

But there was no atmosphere - the music was like a droning 70's experiment in using garage tools as instruments, No suspense - the whole plot is explained in the first 10 minutes, no thrills - the 'it' is about as scary as being chased by a sloth on a slow day, no mood - teenagers looking miserable, staring at each other does not create mood. <br/><br/>It was just boring, bland and unexciting drivel. By the end of the film everything was irritating, right down to the poetry spouting bint talking with a gobfull of food.

","I went to the cinema with friends after seeing the trailer and felt very disappointed with the whole thing. The film initially feels like a typical teenage 'absent parents let's drink and have sex' set up that has been done a million times over as evidenced by the opening scene of a girl running in a circle on the street in shorts and shoes with big heels on. <br/><br/>Only saving grace is the music score, but even that falls short in being supported by what you see next. <br/><br/>Not to mention the misdirected efforts to scare you, like the scene where she is staring down her pants in the bathroom, stares for ages as the music builds only for a ball to hit the window, to try and make you jump, and once it does hit the window, she's suddenly lost interest in the contents of her underwear, and no reason given why she was even looking in the first place!!<br/><br/>The friends in the film have clearly been shoved in just to act as stuffing for the main characters and taken out from that, their characters lack any substance to be people in their own right.<br/><br/>Don't even get me started on the fact that the thing kills her friend in seconds, yet when it gets close enough to kill her, it simply pulls her hair a bit or grabs her by the ankle.<br/><br/>The trailer voice over says that the thing will look like anyone, friend or stranger, in order to get close to her, but the thing shows up as some weird old woman, a half naked cheer leader who is pissing herself, a Langley giant or a twisted featured scary face version of her friend.. Yeah because that will have her running towards it in seconds.<br/><br/>The film makes no effort to find out how the curse started, who started it, just what the thing was etc or any bit of background.<br/><br/>Finally the ending.. Abrupt, makes no sense and let you feeling like 'what was the point in that?' <br/><br/>Overall the film was a massive let down and I wouldn't watch a sequel if the cinema paid me this time round."

But, my husband and I decided to give it a go after reading the reviews and seeing a 6 was the lowest it had gotten. I didn't like this movie at all and actually turned it off about half way through. It does have an 80's feel to it and the scare isn't from a noise that will make you jump. I did like that aspect of it, because horror movies today just aren't horror. I haven't seen a good horror movie in years and this was another disappointment. It was kind of creepy in different parts, but I wouldn't recommend it.

The storyline was great and it had a great idea, but the presentation of the movie was so crappy and poorly filmed. As I watched this movie scene by scene, I felt like it would never end.

Hence when the ratings and reviews reflected the fact that it was a new approach to horror, it was a pleasant surprise that there is some justice.<br/><br/>Lesson #1 : Do not trust the ratings<br/><br/>The only reason I gave it one was cause IMDb doesn't allow a zero. The movie stoops so low on my list that I wish the memory could be repressed. The movie makes 'Manos : Hands of Fate' look like 'Interstellar'.

Make you feel uncomfortable when you're about to sleep. Watching slow as molasses old/naked/old-naked people slowly walk towards you is as threatening watching a toddler walk to you with a foam dagger. The only threat was the runtime of the movie.<br/><br/>Lesson #3: Aaaarrggghhh!<br/><br/>Even though the chip pulse soundtrack was a homage for the 80's John Carpenter style, the timing is horrendous. At moments I burst out laughing cause it completely undid what the creepy camera-work was trying to develop. Couple that with useless dissolve transitions. Shots that convey nothing but boredom. Plot development that does nowhere. No likable characters. Awkward 'getting-laid' conversations. It goes on.<br/><br/>It does serve as a benchmark for how bad, bad can get."

","David Robert Mitchell's picture deserves credit for originality and some genuine tension inducing moments. But on the whole, It Follows fails for several reasons. First of all, once we get to know the entity, it actually is not all that scary. Secondly, in the case of this film, ambiguity does not help and instead of creating a captivating mystery, it ends up giving us too many questions to be answered; not a good thing for a picture like this. And finally, the film has its share of annoying plot holes and silly moments, which cancel out the positive aspects of the film.

The rules were outlined but then it fails to follow them which makes the lack of explanation for the first victim and their place in the spread of the curse even more annoying. The characters are just as much cliche for moronic decisions as any other stupid teen in any other horror movie. The origin of the supernatural presence is brought up but never explored and no motives are ever even hinted at (this is honestly the most ridiculous aspect of the movie, why would a supernatural entity care at all about promiscuity to the extent that it would waste its time and energy stalking these people). There are a lot of inconsistencies and contradictions throughout and that isn't indicative of something so well written that it keeps you thinking and guessing when it's actually so poorly written that it requires the viewer to reach to make sense of it, to draw their own conclusions to fill in everything that was lacking."

In fact, I regularly found myself pleasantly puzzled by the effort which had been put into creating such a visually engaging film, when it really wouldn't necessarily be expected of it, given the subject matter. But, naturally, it is this emphasis on slowness and cinematography which really crafts the whole experience.<br/><br/>I don't think it delves too far into the realm of spoilers to say that this is a 'nice' horror film. There is nothing emotionally wrenching. There is no torture porn... Nothing to make you particularly miserable. It just plods pleasantly along, not moving you too desperately as it goes... but in a good way. There are also no dumb jump scares. The nature of the villain is brooding, and that is how the film presents itself.<br/><br/>Now... While the film does a great job of being absorbing and just sucking you in with its long takes and gently spiralling panoramas, it is not without its cinematic faults. There were two points in the movie where completely unnecessary (and appallingly bad) CGI abruptly took me out of the moment and reminded me that I was actually watching an unbelievable horror film. The use of godawful CGI for these two shots absolutely baffles me. I imagine you'll spot the bits I'm talking about. It looks like freakin' Birdemic and is completely out of character with the rest of the film. Just bizarre. Still... this was only a few seconds out of the movie.<br/><br/>The cast seemed to me to do a fine job. No quibbles there.<br/><br/>This movie, told as it is, feels very much like an allegory.

","Now, I don't mind movies that don't make any apparent sense. In fact, I can appreciate some of them when they are, for example, paired with a quirky humour, deep wisdom, or absolute horror. In short, if there is something about it that makes it worthwhile.<br/><br/>Not so the teen-horror ""it follows"". We're never really told what it actually is, that follows - some sort of STC (sexually transmitted curse), first cast by a witch scorned/horny and angry/pi**ed and hateful? Who knows. All we know is that it follows until you give it to someone else, and again if they happen to die. <br/><br/>Up to a certain point, the movie wasn't too bad. That must have been the point where I started doubting there ever would be some sort of solution or explanation, and it starting to make no sense. Running away from your follower forever is hardly a solution. Transmitting the curse until it comes back to you isn't either. <br/><br/>Following the example of other such movies about curses, the group of friends could have at least tried to figure out where it was really coming from. Insert some exciting amateur sleuth work, the usual frantic newspaper search in a marathon with time, a back-tracking of sexual partners or at the very least some detecting about ""mysterious death cases"" after ""running from an invisible threat"". Anything? Really?<br/><br/>No. Instead, they come up with some sort of mysterious ""plan"", isolate themselves in an abandoned pool, put the girl inside for bait while decorating the edge with plugged-in electrical appliances. Why? Are you guys intending to fry the thing? We've never seen it in water, while we have indeed seen it wet. When Jamie points to the invisible threat and tells her friends how it is indeed not getting in the water (while always walking an accurate zip-line to its victim, right?) we may begin to form the theory it truly abhors water. If that were the case, why not camp out on an island somewhere? No, instead you put the victim in a pool ready to be electrocuted. ""If I'm gonna die I'm gonna take a few with me?"" You think the thing is going to die if the victim dies voluntarily? Or was the plan to electrocute it? Shooting it didn't work. Not sure why electrocution should. (There's other nonsense like ""You're going to die if it touches you!"", yet it touched Jamie about twice - the immediate effect was painful marks, not death.)<br/><br/>Well, while the follower seems reluctant to get in the water, instead throws things at Jamie, the friends try to shoot it, until it ends up in the water.<br/><br/>But then, as they finally have Jamie out of the water... why did they never follow through with the electrocution plan? All they do is huddle around her and yell hysterically about the invisible's whereabouts. Which still is the water. As it mysteriously disappeared in a cloud of blood. <br/><br/>Soooo it is allergic to water after all? Is it ""dead""? <br/><br/>The end of the movie, with Jamie having sex with her friend, and her friend driving through a red light district, suggests otherwise. <br/><br/>Either way, they did nothing really to stand up against it, and nothing is explained, with neither smart dialogue or ancient wisdom woven into the story.<br/><br/>Left me about as satisfied as Jamie, each time she was part of a transmission. <br/><br/>Stars for cinematography, soundtrack, and the fact it was entertaining *up to that certain point*."

Unfortunately, it seems this genre often requires people to make silly choices, or some nonsensical things to happen, to build suspense? or just because? Nonetheless, I call it poor execution. <br/><br/>I did love the cinematography, the fact that it does have an 80s horror feel (especially the music/soundtrack)and the acting was pretty good. <br/><br/>I like the fact that this movie is thought provoking, and doesn't spell everything out. So, you have to pay attention to catch or understand some of the story line.

What's with these dumbasses and hunger?<br/><br/>The opening shot was cool and interesting. I thought we were in for a nice ride. What I got was some stupid girl trying to milk all the pity she could get from her friends, who I must say, are even dumber than her. Why would they care for someone who hasn't shown any redeemable quality in her is beyond me. I just wanted IT to end the misery by pushing the girl into a volcano or something.<br/><br/>This film should never have been categorized horror. Some young adult nonsense maybe, but not horror. The horror is the fact some producer thought this is a great idea, let's finance this."

","It Follows has quite a preposterous concept to sell to the viewer. Can you follow the idea of a deadly curse being dispensed through sexual intercourse? In the horror genre, anything can happen and you must give it the benefit of the doubt. Does it work in this film? That all depends on how you like to slice your logic. In my minuscule opinion, without proper connection between mythology and reality, the story becomes downright silly in short time. I blame the execution more than the concept. The film could have certainly got away with no explanation of how things came to be if it had just been more covert about certain visual elements which only boggled the mind (uneven death scenes and the exposure of death incarnate). A story involving sexual ritual (more of this) and shadowy lurkers (and less of that) would've served the concept better. Instead, we are given too much to feed the imagination which leaves the story exposed and all its faults to hang.<br/><br/>And so it doesn't even scare. There's nothing to be scared of... unless you're generally afraid of strangers in a lethargic state. With no element of suspense to build the threat, the horror effect is mostly underwhelming. There is scarcely a worry of who or what is around the corner. Mystery goes totally ignored and the fear of isolation is grossly underused here. Again, better off keeping the monster in obscurity than showing its cute face is the summation of this review.<br/><br/>Does the soundtrack remind anyone else of an 80s sword and sorcery b-movie?"
"kimheniadis","3","11","20","15 January 2016"," I really don't know what all the hype is about.
","I am not sure what all the hype was about for this horror movie. The critics on Rotten Tomatoes gave it 96% fresh and 66% of the audience liked it. I am definitely more in line with the audience.<br/><br/>Spoilers Ahead<br/><br/>I kept hearing that it was so intense, and that you'd be scanning everyone in the background to see who is after the victim. Um, no. It was completely obvious who was after the intended victim. Most of the time the scene was so bare of other people, there was no other choice as to who it would be.<br/><br/>The main character's acting just checked out after she told her friends that something was following her, and when they finally believed her. Jay looked comatose, constantly lying against her friend, or even just straight up sleeping. I would think she would be way more hyped up, on constant alert, and afraid of going to sleep. More like a Nightmare on Elm Street vibe.<br/><br/>You needed to have sex to pass it onto the next person, so the creature would be after them instead of you. What if she were to have sex with three different guys at the same time? (Yes, one in each opening.) Would it pass on to all three of them? It might make me a slut, but I would try it, just on the off chance it worked. The creature having to kill three people before it got back to me is way better odds than just one person.<br/><br/>And the end scene in the pool where the creature is throwing electrical items at Jay. Okay, I suppose I can go with each item coming unplugged from an electrical source before it hit the water. But some of them were on really long extension cords. Every single one the creature threw was on a short cord??<br/><br/>The other thing with the pool, they are in the most run down part of Detroit and every building near by is super run down or vacant/vandalized. But here you have this gorgeous brick building in perfect condition. Even better it has running electricity and a huge, well maintained swimming pool. No. Just No.<br/><br/>And what was up with Jay's friends (Annie?) giving a monologue about not being able to go past Eight Mile when she was a kid because that's where the suburbs ended and the bad part of town began. Since the writer is from Michigan, this was his nod to his home state, but it served no purpose to the plot, and in fact just stood out as super odd.<br/><br/>This is such a minor thing, but Jay's cast. The first time she's just walking around her pool with the cast on. That's super fun. At least be on a raft floating around. And then later on she's in actual bodies of water. Even if it's a fiberglass one, you are not to get it wet. I know a stupid, picky thing, but just one more thing to add to the list of annoyances.<br/><br/>And where were all the parents in this movie. I know it's a typical horror movie, and the parents need to be elsewhere for the teens to get into trouble. But every other adult was home. A woman unpacking her groceries, lots of people doing yard work, etc.<br/><br/>What I took away from this is if you are a teen/young adult, do not have sex. You will get an STD, maybe even a supernatural one.<br/><br/>There were a couple good parts; the musical score did it's job by keeping me off balance a bit, and it did provide some tension. I also enjoyed the cinematography having a more 80's slasher movie vibe to it. But at points where the camera is scanning the scene 360 degrees looking for the creature, I had to close my eyes because it was making me queasy. But that may have been the objective, if so, well done.<br/><br/>Although it may not seem like it, I really do feel bad not having liked it. I was so excited to find a good horror movie, since they are rare lately. But alas, No. Just No."

Some basic unanswered questions that are: Why didn't they go to school? where are their parents? how did the ex-boyfriend know so much about the curse? why did the ex-boyfriend do that stupid ""kidnapping""?<br/><br/>It would have been better if this group of friends discovered more and more about the curse by accident, like relating the moment when Jay started seen the thing (her sexual encounter with her boyfriend) with an infidelity of her boyfriend. That way they would have learned how the curse operates and is passed around. The plan to get rid of it could have consisted on passing the curse to someone undesirable, like one of the bullies from school."

","If I could give this movie a 0/10 I would. Like many others, I want a refund for having actually sat through the entire movie.<br/><br/>I find it incredibly fishy how according to the stats on average males age 18-29 rated this movie a 7.8. I won't try to speak for the other demographics, but something tells me there are a LOT of fake/paid ratings for this movie. No young adult in the right mind would find this to be a good movie, let alone a horror movie for that matter. If you took out the nudity then this movie would be rated PG-13, like was it honestly even necessary? It wasn't even nudity ANYONE would want to see to begin with; if I wanted to see someone p1ss themself while standing half naked in the kitchen I would go ahead and shotgun a dozen beers right now.<br/><br/>The movie accomplishes absolutely nothing. In fact the name tells you everything there is to know about this movie. Shortly after the opening scene it was obvious that this movie was going to suck. The 80's horror music was incredibly annoying, and it's not even that I don't like old horror movie soundtracks, it was just overdone and not necessary for the movie. I couldn't tell you ANY of the character's names and nor did I really give a damn about them. Also why sex? What relevance does having sex have to do with ""passing on"" this, ""It""? What if they used protection? WHAT DEFINES SEX?!?! I really liked how this movie presented a lot of relevant information and totally didn't waste anytime doing it (just kidding that was sarcasm). The movie makes some extreme jumps in between scenes, with lousy editing might I add, and also contains some really ""random"" ones for lack of a better word. Then it all just sorta, ends, abruptly. There is no ending. I personally believe the director just didn't know how to wrap up this stinking turd. I mean there's actually way too much wrong with this movie to mention in a single review.<br/><br/>I wish I had checked out my local theater's ratings on this movie before I went and seen it. 2.36/10, now there's a rating you can trust!"

","I saw the trailer for this film, then it was reviewed on Film 2015 with Claudia Winkleman and Danny Leigh, then I saw the positive critics ratings, from what I had heard I was hoping for a really good scary movie. Basically the film opens with young Annie (Bailey Spry) running away from something following her, before driving to the beach and calling her father to apologise for being unkind sometimes, and the next morning she has been brutally killed. Nineteen year old Jay Height (Maika Monroe) goes on a movie date with Hugh (Jake Weary), before he panics spotting a woman at the entrance, whom Jay cannot see, fearful he demands they leave, and this unknown invisible woman slowly follows them. On another date Jay and Hugh have sex in the car, before he smothers her with a cloth of chloroform, when she wakes Hugh explains that their sex has passed a curse onto her: an entity that can only be seen by those cursed and can take on the appearance of any person, it will follow her at a walking pace, if it catches her it will kill her and pursue the previous person to pass it on. The next day police report Hugh is missing, then Jay is stalked by an old woman in a hospital gown, invisible to others, but her friends Paul (Keir Gilchrist) (who has a crush on her) and Yara (Olivia Luccardi), and her sister Kelly Height (Lili Sepe) agree to help her, seeing that she is distressed about something. The four of them spend the night together, they hear a window smash, after some trepidation Jay investigates, then she sees a half naked woman with dark eyes walking towards her while urinating, she runs upstairs, but the others can't see anything unusual, then a tall man with dark eyes enters the room, so Jay flees on a bike to the nearby playground. Jay's friends find her on the swings, and neighbour Greg Hannigan (Daniel Zovatto) offers to drive them wherever they need to go and to help, together the group trace Hug's real address, Hugh advises Jay to have sex with another person to pass on the curse, as he did. The group drive to Greg's lake house, there Jay learns to fire a gun, while the group sit by the water Jay is attacked by the entity, which has taken the appearance of Yara, it also takes on the appearance of the tall man and Paul, it is shot by Jay, but it recovers and continues after her, she flees in Greg's car, before crashing into a corn field, waking in hospital with an injured arm. To the disappointment of Paul, Jay sleeps with Greg to pass on the curse, later from her window Jay sees Greg smash his own house window and enter, she tries to warn the real Greg on the phone, before running across the street to help him, the entity has taken on the form of Greg's half naked mother knocking on his door, it jumps on him and appears to have sex with him as he is killed. Jay flees and spends the night outside, waking on a beach she sees three men in a boat, undressing she walks into the water, presumably heading towards them to have sex with one of them and buy herself some time, returning home she refuses the offer of sex from Paul, the group plan to draw the entity to them and kill it, while in the car Jay spots a naked man on her house roof looking at her. The group go to a deserted swimming pool, surrounding it with electrical devices and appliances, they plan to lure the entity into the water and plunging the devices into the water, Jay in the water spots it, to her horror it has taken on the appearance of her father, devices in the water are thrown back at Jay, Paul accidentally wounds Yara firing at the invisible target, but he then shoots it in the head, it appears to die. In the end, Jay and Paul have sex, and they walk as a couple down the street hand in hand, but in the background a person can be seen behind walking after them, this may be the entity. Monroe is rather captivating as the leading victim, I agree with critics this has obviously taken inspiration from stalker/slasher movies like Halloween, and malevolent ghost stories like Ring, the sinister entity that follows the victims that constantly changes it is a good tactic for keeping tension building, there it a little bit of gore, but it relies much more on slow paced chills, it may not be as terrifying as I thought it was going to be, but it a worthwhile horror film. Very good!"

"TheRedDeath30","8","16","33","19 July 2015"," It Follows Will Follow You ... Yes, I went there
","I watch a ton of horror movies, both big and small budget. As a horror junkie, I also spend a lot of time in the social horror communities, discussing our newest finds and buried treasures. Naturally, it is easy to find many studios and sites hyping many a horror film as instant classics, or pushing them as innovative and fresh. Most of these films end up revealing themselves to be mostly forgettable and within a year you find no one talks about them anymore. IT FOLLOWS has been receiving this type of hype, but it's my believe that this movie will prove itself to be one with a lasting impact that will be talked about for quite some time, despite a few weaknesses in the movie.<br/><br/>Some of the film's greatest strengths, but also greatest weaknesses lie in the style of the film, which is the tenet that seems to be getting the most attention when I hear people discussing the movie online. Namely, the way that Mitchell, the director, has been able to emulate so much of what made Carpenter's style recognizable, while still showing his own twist on that style. Mitchell uses his camera in almost an exact style to Carpenter, a style that Carpenter, in turn, had pulled from his western influences and directors like Hawkes. The camera pulls back to wide, stark angles that capture perfect beauty in the static nature of its' scenes, while at the same time capable of zooming in on scenes and using the camera to feel like a character of its' own, stalking the ""good guys"" from the shadows.<br/><br/>Much like Carpenter, the dialog can sometimes be sparse, allowing the themes and images to play out for the viewer organically, rather than shoving them down our throats with exposition. The biggest thing that the Carpenter aficionado will appreciate is the score, which does not use standard Hollywood strings, or overdone modern rock music. No, my friends, this is a full on unnerving synthesizer assault that is able to be both catchy and creepy.<br/><br/>Of course, the biggest question that the horror fan has to ask is how far Mitchell can push this emulation of Carpenter without pushing into stealing a style, but I think that Mitchell ends up doing an admirable job of reminding viewers of the creator that he clearly looks up to, while at the same time feeling fresh and modern for a new generation of horror fans.<br/><br/>The script and writing, also, do a fantastic job of exploring the themes in this movie. Clearly, using the monster as an analogy for STD, many of remarked on the similarities to the body horror of Cronenberg. I think that the writing goes much beyond that, though. Rather than just seeing a disease destroying our main character, the director looks to the slasher genre and the ideas of an unstoppable, unrelenting force. He uses a monster that is terrifying, at times, and owes much to the slashers as a substitute for his STD, creating something new and unique. Again, though, a hardcore horror fan might ask how many times the genre can plumb the depths of the sexual disease as metaphor for its' horror, but I feel that this movie does a good enough job of creating something new out of it.<br/><br/>I appreciate the way that the writer twists the usual horror conventions, as well. It would be easy to see this is as an obvious metaphor for the virgin facing death as punishment of her sin of sex, but that movie pushes past that overdone trope to show us that, perhaps, it is the ethics and morality of our ""final girl"" that allows her to, ultimately, put an end to the monster and stop the curse, whereas so many before her chose to escape and pass it on.<br/><br/>The cynics will point out how much of this movie has been done before and they may not be wrong. The acolytes will praise this as something new in the face of a glut of shiny CGI borefests and they are onto something, as well. I found the cynic in me wanted to keep finding reasons to prove that this movie was not worth the hype, but the more I watched of the movie, the more it drew me in and captured my interest and proved to me that there are still great movies being produced in the horror genre every day."

She drives to the beach where she calls her father apologising for trivial reasons as she speaks with fear in her voice. By the following morning, she has been brutally murdered, her body twisted and contorted.<br/><br/>Young college student Jay goes on a movie date with Hugh. In the theatre, they begin playing a game whereby one person picks someone out of the audience and other person must guess who they've selected. Hugh points out a woman standing at the entrance in a yellow dress whom Jay cannot see. Fearful, he demands they leave. On another date, Hugh and Jay have sex in his car, after which Hugh incapacitates her with chloroform. When she wakes, tied to a wheelchair, Hugh explains that their sex has passed on a curse: an entity which can only be seen by those with the curse, and can take on the appearance of any person. It will follow Jay at walking pace. If it catches her it will kill her and then pursue the previous person to have passed it on. This explanation points out to the audience that the unnamed girl at the beginning of the story is clearly who Hugh had passed it on to, but upon her death, ""it"" has returned to haunt him once again. He tells Jay that the only way she can escape the entity is to sleep with someone to pass on the curse. Wanting Jay to witness ""it"" first hand, so she will believe Hugh is telling the truth, he waits until a naked woman begins walking toward them. As Jay is clearly hysterical by this chain of events, he eventually releases her, drives her home, and flees.<br/><br/>The next day, the police cannot find the woman or Hugh. At school, Jay sees an old woman in a hospital gown walking towards her, invisible to others. Jay's sister, Kelly, and her friends Paul and Yara agree to help and spend the night in her house. In the middle of the night Paul investigates a smashed kitchen window but sees no one; Jay sees a half-naked and bloodied woman walking toward her, urinating. She runs upstairs to the others, who cannot see the entity. When a tall man with gouged-out eyes enters the bedroom, Jay flees the house and rides a bike to a nearby playground, where her friends find her.<br/><br/>With the help of their neighbour Greg, they drive to a unsavoury part of urban Detroit to an abandoned house where supposedly Hugh lived. Inside they find that Hugh has set up strings of tin cans and other noisemakers to detect an intruder entering the house. Living in ""squatter-like"" conditions, they discover a picture of Hugh and a girl wearing a varsity letterman's jacket, thus identifying his high school alma mater. Jay and Greg then go to his high school, and searching through an old high school yearbook, they discover that indeed Hugh is really ""Jeff."" The group traces Jeff to his real address. He tells them he got the curse from a one-night stand. The group decides to drive to Greg's lake house, where Jay learns to fire a gun. The entity, taking on the appearances of Yara, the tall man, and Paul, attacks Jay; she shoots it, but it recovers. Jay flees in Greg's car but crashes into a corn field, and awakens in the hospital with a broken arm and a head injury.<br/><br/>Greg agrees to sleep with Jay to pass on the curse, and insists he doesn't believe in it. Days later, Jay sees Greg smash the window to his own house and enter. She tries to warn the real Greg on the telephone but he does not answer. She runs into the house and finds the entity in the form of Greg's half-naked mother knocking on his bedroom door; it jumps on Greg and appears to rape him as he dies.<br/><br/>Jay flees by car and spends the night outdoors. Awaking the next day, she hears music and voices coming from the nearby lake. Walking to the beach, Jay sees three young men on a boat just offshore. She undresses and walks into the water with the apparent intention of having sex with them to pass on the curse. When she returns home, Paul arrives, but she refuses Paul's offer of sex to pass on the curse. Paul formulates another plan, and the group leaves Jay's house. As they drive away, she sees a naked man on the roof of her house watching her, showing that she either never slept with the young men or that the stalking entity has already killed them and has returned to her.<br/><br/>The group then heads to an abandoned swimming pool, where they plan to kill the entity by luring it into the pool and plunging electrical devices into the water. Jay, waiting in the pool, spots the entity and realises it has taken the appearance of her deceased father; it throws the devices at her. Firing at an invisible target, Paul accidentally wounds Yara, but manages to shoot the entity in the head, knocking it into the pool. As it drags Jay underwater, he shoots it again and Jay escapes. She then sees its blood filling the pool.<br/><br/>Jay and Paul have sex. Later, Paul drives through a seedy part of town past women who appear to be prostitutes. In the final scene, Paul and Jay walk down the street hand in hand, as a unknown stranger approaches them from behind on foot, but their fate is left unknown as the camera fades."

","This is my first time writing this, so, I'm not really sure how to write a review for a movie but here it goes.<br/><br/>Let me get started, I was thrilled and excited to watch this movie when I read reviews on this. LOTS of people saying that this movie is the best horror movie and stuff. So, I even decided to watch this with my mother in the cinema. <br/><br/>Sadly, I feel that this movie is not worth the hype. It bored us and my mother is the kind of person that get scared easily.<br/><br/>But I guess it is just because I had such a high expectation for this movie.<br/><br/>I feel like some of the scenes are ugh like when :<br/><br/>1. Hugh put Jay in a wheelchair to tell her about IT after raping her. Why didn't he just tell her on the way back home or anything? He's driving her home after all. <br/><br/>2. Her friends are really calm when confronting Hugh which raped Jay and left IT to follow her. Most teenagers I knew wouldn't be that calm.Even an adult wouldn't be that calm when confronting someone that raped their friends/s. I'm not saying that they should hit him or anything, but seriously??<br/><br/>3. One time when Jay is scared, she ran away to a playground sitting on a swing- in the middle of the night at an open space- by herself. Since when is it a good idea to be by yourself when an entity is following you?<br/><br/>4. I'm sure that Greg saw that they were attacked by something that couldn't be seen so why is he being such an a$$ about it. He kept on insisting that IT wasn't real.<br/><br/>5. An abandoned swimming pool has a working electricity power? Hm okay.<br/><br/>So yea. I don't feel any tense when watching this. I don't know about others but I'm not a fan of this.<br/><br/>P/S: This is just my opinion. If you like this movie, good for you. If you don't, good for you too. My English is bad, I know."

","This film takes a simple idea and translates it into an extended exercise of moody terror. There are no wasted gestures; everything accumulates towards a clear message that somehow people take to be a propaganda film about abstinence. Here's an idea: Growing up is scary, and adults (despite their best intentions) have no real idea of what is on a teenager's mind. In the world of the film, young people are forced to face inevitable transformations at the hands of forces they don't understand, plagued by desires they can't necessarily control. This film is about losing innocence and realizing that the world isn't fair. <br/><br/>There are some jump scares and graphic intensity, but the real heart of the film is in the dialogue and feelings of the characters. It's as if someone took a slasher flick and made the characters real people, with vulnerability and emotion instead of plastic surgery boobs and six pack abs."

","I watched this movie with my best friend last night, and we were left wandering why the 2nd and 3rd act were so bad. A great beginning, it was creepy and we were exited and scared, BUT it became boring soon after, i knew nothing was going to happen and that she was just going to run from 'it', and eventually it led to an anticlimactic finale, it was left on us to decide whether 'it' was gone or just few moments away from killing them. The original idea of the film was OK, a STD king of monster never leaving you at peace, with it's possibility of killing you eventually very high. But it wasn't executed well. The rules changed throughout, from 'its' appearance to 'its' killing methods... And the jump scares were obvious, we laughed instead of actually being scared.

P.S: 'scary' music was terrible."
"ReasonablePiper","8","5","8","7 July 2016"," More Than Lives Up to the Hype
","I was excited going into this movie. I had heard great things about it: it was scary, it was retro-styled, and the score was great. There also seemed to some backlash against it, with others saying it was boring and overrated. Luckily this movie, like The Babadook and The Witch, lives up to the hype instead of being a pretentious bore. These three movies are frequently championed as the best modern horror has to offer, and It Follows is my favorite of the three.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a teenage girl running out of her house and down the street like something is chasing her. Right away Halloween's influence is apparent: the empty streets, tall trees, and quiet neighborhood bring Haddonfield to mind. Bucking the trend of there being no help, a concerned neighbor asks if the girl is alright. She refuses help, runs back into her house, and drives off in her car. She sits alone at the beach, her headlights casting a circle of safe light around her. Cut to her dead body, leg twisted back at the knee. Never once is the danger is seen, but it is definitely felt.<br/><br/>Like in Halloween, the characters in It Follows are always being, well, followed, and the cinematography does a great job capturing this feeling. One particular shot comes to mind. The camera remains stationary as Jay and her sister (or friend?) walk into her house. It feels exactly like a stalker stopped in his tracks to watch them go inside. The synth score, while not as melodious as Halloween's, made the tension and scares stronger. Once Jay learns the premise of the monster, the tension never lets up. None of the scares fail, and I don't remember any jump scares. The characters are good friends and never succumb to dumb horror clichés. The acting is good, and the cinematography is breathtaking at times.<br/><br/>I only have a few complaints. The scene where Jay contemplates sleeping with three men on a boat doesn't sit well with me. She stripes and walks into the water, and it cuts to her driving. Her hair is wet, so we know that if she didn't sleep with them, she at least got close. I just have a hard time seeing how the scene would go if she slept with them. Just earlier she seemed really unsure of passing it along to someone else, and while doing it to a stranger is easier, it also seems more immoral, and Jay seemed like she wanted to do the right thing. Also, how many of the men did she sleep with? Having sex with three random guys at once seems a little hard to by, and I would think those men would be more than a little suspicious of a girl willing to do that. If she just slept with one, then where did the other two guys go? Later she sees a the thing following her as a naked man on her roof. That could have been a guy on the boat, but we never see their faces clearly. Jay's face driving reveals nothing, which would be strange if she had just had sex with any of them. Something about this scene just doesn't seem right. One poster on the message boards said Jay should have been crying, that way each possibility would seem more likely. I agreed with that, but then I wondered the point of making this scene ambiguous at all. The rules of the game aren't revealed until twenty minutes in, and although it isn't that late, it's late enough that I think it should have been kept as a surprise.<br/><br/>After Jay and Paul have sex (a cold scene), they walk hand in hand down the sidewalk. Then it ends. My first thought was, ""That's it?!"" But then I thought about it and, while maybe not perfect, it was a fine ending. Paul finally gets his dream girl, Jay has romance, they can help each other, and the thing still follows (possibly). This is ambiguity done right. When they fought the thing in the pool earlier, the pool filled with blood, something it had never done before. Maybe that meant it was dead, but no one really knows, and they'll never know unless they catch someone following them. The last shot shows someone walking down the sidewalk much further behind Jay and Paul. Is this ""It?"" It's a great question, and I like that it ends with this uncertainty. There's a theory out there that Jay and Paul are dead in this scene, but I can't think of any evidence to support this theory. The director put in objects from different time periods to make the movie feel like a dream. I can't wait to watch it again to look for these things, and to try to find deeper meaning, of which I'm sure there's plenty."

","Wow. This one left a mark. A modern horror film that actually works (for me, that is). I felt like watching an old John Carpenter movie.<br/><br/>THE STORY takes you directly into the action but leaves enough unanswered questions to be eerie and exciting. You don't really know what is following you or why. Also the time period is unclear: looks like the 70's, feels like the 80's but sometimes seems to be present time. Adds to the mystery a bit.<br/><br/>THE CHARACTERS are typical of 70's horror flicks but not as obnoxious or stupid, what makes it more fun to watch.<br/><br/>THE ATMOSPHERE is just oppressive. The ""monster"" moves slow and steady, relentless like Michael Myers. Since it can look like anyone you never feel quite safe. The camera work is exceptional and perfectly underlined with the outstanding soundtrack that actually could be considered a character of it's own here."
"magnuslhad","7","5","8","29 February 2016"," relentless
","A young women is pursued by a terrifying demonic force, a curse she inherited through the act of sexual intercourse. The only way to buy time for herself seems to be by passing on the curse through sex to someone else. This premise has echoes of 1998's 'Fallen' with Denzel Washington, but the execution is much more lush and laden with deliberate ambiguity. Jay is marked for victimhood by Jeff, who in his own tortured angst sees no alternative than to put Jay between him and IT. He at least gives her a sporting chance, explaining the rules of the game as he understands them. Jeff's explanations underpin the ambiguity: the IT he sees seems far more able to blend in with the common population than Jay's perception of IT, which is almost always dishevelled, if not downright naked. Does IT always take the form of our own nightmares? If so, what exactly is the psychology behind the form IT takes in the climactic encounter with Jay in a swimming pool? The film does a wonderful job of creating a brooding storyworld. The ravages of fiscal and political immorality threaten youth as much as casual sex, as Jay and her cohort drive numbed and hunted through economically ravaged landscapes that seem to belong to a time not of their making. The film plays on dread, self-aware in its evocation of 70s and 80s horror, down to the cars people drive, the incongruous TV sets they watch, and the electronic score. Maika Monroe as Jay is the able conduit for this sense of dread, plausibly unhinged by the fearful and uncanny episodes of IT's ineluctable approach. Keir Gilchrist as the love-struck Paul embodies the frustrations and bitter compromises that his generation have had foisted upon them. There is no American dream here, no bright future, just the day-to-day coping with an unpalatable present. Jay swims to a speedboat, Paul buys time with hookers, and another character seems to use his female classmates as a buffer, but there is a sense here of simply delaying the inevitable, both plot-wise and thematically. The film works to make assets of its limitations, throwing up more questions than answers. The ending is somewhat abrupt, smacking of first installment rather than finality, but that open-ended full stop also sparks conversations. Disturbing, intelligent and lovingly crafted, this film gets under your skin and lingers."

","It Follows is, quite simply, a great achievement. David Robert Mitchell has created a film that's unsettling on many levels. From the moment the Carpenter-esque electronic score kicks in and the chilling, bizarre opening scenes play out, the viewer knows that this is not going to be a conventional ride. <br/><br/>Like A Nightmare on Elm Street, I love the mythology of this film. Its premise is quite simple but it's something I've not seen before, especially in Western cinema. The closest comparison that immediately springs to mind is 1998's Ring and this may be partly to the cinematography. It Follows looks beautiful and there are a lot of things going on at an almost subliminal level that knock the viewer out of their comfort zone. Pay attention to the changing seasons, the sense of timelessness that cloaks It Follows, the general other- worldliness that exists. Like The Shining, it's a smörgåsbord of tiny details that all stack up to create an unnerving and thoroughly uncomfortable experience.<br/><br/>This is a clever, thinking person's horror tale. The shocks and chills are smart and constant and there's very little time for the viewer to relax. There's a genuine sense that something bad is just out of the camera's sight and that an unspeakable, mysterious evil is stalking characters who we care about. <br/><br/>9 out of 10. Thoroughly recommended."
"brando647","8","5","8","16 February 2016"," Eerie and Atmospheric...IT FOLLOWS is One to Watch
","It's always refreshing to find a horror movie that succeeds in freaking me out to some extent. David Robert Mitchell's IT FOLLOWS manages to do just that. Watching it the first time in total darkness and slightly less than sober, it had me jumping at shadows when it was over. It's just so perfectly atmospheric. It feels so retro and modern and the same time, and it comes with a John Carpenter vibe thanks to the eerie synth score from Disasterpeace. This has got to be a breakout hit for both writer/director Mitchell and his cast of unknowns. I've been trying to do my part in spreading the word on the film to friends, as I know it'll be easy for a small indie film like this to pass under the radar without getting the attention I feel it rightly deserves. IT FOLLOWS is essentially a film about a sexually-transmitted poltergeist. We're introduced to our heroine Jay (Maika Monroe) as she's preparing for a date with a guy she's feeling pretty good about, and the date goes well enough that the two of them close it out with a tryst in his car in an abandoned industrial parking lot (romantic, yeah?). Then it gets freaky. He knocks her out and ties her to a wheelchair, but it's for her own good. He needs her to listen to what he's about to explain: he has just passed It on to her. What ""it"" is, he has no idea. But it was following him and now it's going to follow her. Then only way to get rid of it is to have sex with someone else and pass it along. It will follow you, no matter where you run. And never, ever let it catch up to you<br/><br/>I went into IT FOLLOWS expecting a slasher film. A murderous specter that haunts you, following you until it gets close enough to murder you, and all you can do to survive is pass it down the line. The premise sounds ripe for some real cheese but nope. Mitchell presents IT FOLLOWS with full seriousness and it works so incredibly well. The death count is low in this movie because it isn't about the kills. It's about the constant nagging fear and paranoia of the victim. They're forced to constantly keep one eye over their shoulder and if you suspect someone in the crowd isn't what they appear, you run. The spirit/demon/ghost/whatever will attempt to disguise itself if it means getting close enough to its victim. And the best part? Mitchell never bothers explaining what ""It"" is. I can't state how much I love that It is left a mystery. From start to finish, we waste no time speculating on what it is. We just ride along with Jay and her friends as they scramble to figure out how to save her; granted she could just pass it off but that's no guarantee. If ""It"" manages to kill its next victim, it just reverts back to the previous. Then there's the whole ""willingly giving an unsuspecting victim a death sentence"" thing that (understandably) bothers her.<br/><br/>IT FOLLOWS feels as much a psychological thriller as it is a horror film. Like I said, it wasn't the slasher I was anticipating so we spend the majority of the movie with Jay, watching how she handles her bleak situation. She starts the film so bright-eyed and hopeful. She relaxes in the pool, playfully shooing away neighborhood kids peeping through the fence, and kids around with her sister and their friends. Her life appears incredibly simple and happy. Then it all changes and she is absolutely traumatized. She takes to locking herself away, barricading doors and trusting no one. Nowhere is safe. But her friends are there for her through the whole of it, even if her story sounds more than a little insane. IT FOLLOWS has obvious allusions to the inherent dangers in sex (particularly STDs) but I feel as if there could be even more layers that I haven't picked up on. This is a movie that almost demands multiple viewings, as you're bound to discover more each time. There's a recurring theme of water (what with constant use of pools and lakes) but I haven't figured out the significance behind it yet. It's one of those elements ripe for post-viewing discussion. IT FOLLOWS is tense, haunting, and it would stick with me long after it finished. I have few complaints about the film but the one major misstep that bothers me each time is the final act, when Jay and her friends devise a harebrained scheme to put an end to It. But it's a minor quibble that doesn't detract from my glowing praise for the film, and I really recommend anyone that's considering IT FOLLOWS should give it the time."

","I am not an avid horror movie-goer, let's put it that way. I think most modern horror movies are very bland, and when it's not some demented doll or house, its teen drama revolving around a curse. 'It Follows' brings back that classic 'can't run away from slowly moving threat' theme. But, it works. Yeah there's sex and cheesy things like that, BUT the characters aren't TOO bland together and work well as a realistic group of friends. None of the scares really 'jump' out at you. The filmmakers simply lay it out for you on plate and you get to look at it for a few seconds. This works though! I hate horror movies filled with jump scares and what not, it has to be terrifying throughout the entire scene. The cinematography is great, I was impressed with the shots and the color choices/variation and the editing isn't too bad either. The sound design is what really got me though, it was, 'ominously 80's' horror style."

","As a person who's main film interest is the horror genre and as a person who sees most main horror films at the theater and on demand, I know where the horror genre stands. I admit found footage films have their issues and it is overdone but I like most of them. Sadly though, from January through at least February you are going to get studios putting out and dumping horror films on the market that they know will not make money and will have not get a good reception. You don't see horror weekly at a theater due to the fact it's a genre with a limited market and audience. A growing theme to be noted is that the best horror are the independent films or at the least the ones with the least amount of star power and budget in my eyes.<br/><br/>The 2014 movie It Follows has several themes. It has only a budget of $2 million and it's got a smaller release to start which later expanded to a bigger release. With a cast of people like Maika Monroe, Keir Gilchrist and Jake Weary, this is a cast of the not the biggest names. I thought It Follows might be a good horror movie. Good is not the right term for this. It Follows has you lost for descriptive words for all the right reasons.<br/><br/>After Jay Height (Monroe) goes on a first date with Hugh (Jake Weary) and after having a sex in his car, Jay wakes up underdressed and tied up in a wheelchair. Hugh claims that a curse is now upon her with a type of entity that will follow Jay until she passes it on to somebody else. Jay now must try to survive while many of her close friends are at her side.<br/><br/>One issue with horror nowadays is originality. Sure, we can find some good original horror films but stuff like The Last Exorcism or You're Next were toned down and not very good because of a lack of originality. Yes, It Follows is very original but it's such a different type of topic and substance to plot. We've had many horror films have sex scenes before but this film does it the smart way by having no nudity and not being very detailed in those scenes. It's as if the film is trying to say it's taboo for you to have sex and this entity is your punishment. You also have all those small time actors all delivering strong performances while making this plot very convincing. It's up to the audience to decide what this brilliant and uncanny plot actually is and you could literally have a several hour conversation over it.<br/><br/>If you go into It Follows expecting to get jump scares, you are in the wrong mindset. This film is meant to creep you out but not that way. Why is a girl with urine coming out of her walking towards us? Why is person with a nightgown on top of the roof? The idea of being tied up right after sex is unsettling. With nothing explained again about these elements, your mind is led to wander to interesting places. Not only that, but director David Robert Mitchell puts in this alternative/techno music that's just going to get under your skin. He also sets up scenes with interesting camera angles and big backgrounds that seems to be a clear inspiration from something like Halloween of 1978.<br/><br/>A theme some people who are taking about this movie are not touching upon is the idea of water. Jay goes to a beach house to get away from the curse. There is also an interesting above-ground pool ""floating"" scene. She also fights this entity in a local rec pool which might be the most interesting film scene I have ever seen. Maybe this entity comes from water? It's also not like water is a common theme in horror either. Very imaginative. <br/><br/>Shot around the Detroit area, this movie ultimately comes back to me. Growing up in the same general area and my dad's side of the family lived in these exact style neighborhood the film presents to us. Call it bias on my part but this atmosphere does add to strangeness level of the film because the houses are so dated with 70's/80's touches that are not at all modern. The neighborhoods seem isolated with a lack of people around. This is an atmosphere that nobody has ever seen before and because it's not like many horror films are shot in Detroit. Twenty years from now, I know for a fact I will be the guy checking out these film locations right by me.<br/><br/>It Follows is a film with no answers and even with getting that wider release, it's still not going to earn as much money as a big horror film. You do hope Mitchell and his cast all get more recognition because it is credit that is deserved. I do have a strong feel though that a cult following will be attached to this later on and that we will be calling this ""Michigan Horror"". It Follows is something we should follow because you have nothing to lose. A modern classic."
"pokemon_trainer_lucas","3","3","4","25 June 2019"," Badly executed film
","The idea behind this film had a lot of potential; if a curse could be passed on only through sex, then you would have to create a very strong bond with someone and then break that apart, or sexually abuse someone, both of which would be traumatic and emotionally exhausting. This film could have been so much more of a horror than it was.<br/><br/>Other than lame teenage acting, this film was bad for a number of reasons.<br/><br/>1. Music. What was up with the music?! It's like some kind of retro synthetic crap that really has no place in a horror movie, especially not for the entire movie, when frightening and suspenseful music would have been much more appropriate. It just made it laughable and seem much more dated than it was.<br/><br/>2. The speed at which ""It"" follows. To have the evil entity following at slower than walking pace is just ridiculous. You could easily evade this entity without difficulty for the rest of your life if you had to, so the fact that even 1 person died is just unbelievable.<br/><br/>3. It's not actually scary. The scenes where you are clearly intended to be frightened are just, well, not scary. I wouldn't go as far as saying they are laughable, but I would definitely say that they are ineffective and unentertaining.<br/><br/>I just wouldn't recommend this movie, I'm sorry."

Like using the cheat codes in a game to get all the weapons at the start - there's no sense of discovery or achievement.<br/><br/>There is no tension, no gradual unveiling of the creature - it's just there, plodding towards it's marked victim with no reason or motivation. We never learn why and the lack of consistency in the creatures actions causes confusion for the viewer.<br/><br/>The acting is mediocre but consistent with the apparent budget so it didn't bother me that much and the dialog wasn't bad between the characters so there are some plus points there.<br/><br/>The main issue is the typical horror genre cliches - people that lose all common sense and will of self-preservation make stupid decisions all the way through the film, it's also full of plot holes and inconsistencies.<br/><br/>It's just lazy writing - I have no idea whatsoever why this is getting rave reviews.

It just follows you... that's it. Sure it can kill anyone it follows, but is walks so slowly that it kind of becomes ridiculous after a while.<br/><br/>Second, the characters react like absolute morons most of the time. The being is passed on by having sex with another person and the main character is accompanied by two men most of the time. All these guys want to do is to have sex with the main character. Supposedly they want to ""help her"" to get rid of the being, but in the end they just come across like horny guys looking for an excuse to have sex.<br/><br/>This movie irritated me so much towards the end because the stupidity of the characters just increased as the movie went on.

"DavidMovieReview","3","3","4","2 September 2016"," Soso Acting of Repetitive Script
","***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>The most disturbing thing about this film is the high rating of it. The script is a repetitive bore. The premise of a zombie that mutates into virtually any human form with or without clothing that just keeps coming and coming no matter how many times you kill it is simply a zombie variant. There's lots of gratuitous nudity among the zombies who probably don't have to worry about a future career. The idea that the one being followed has been infected by some sort of spiritual attractant is interesting, but the problem is that this is about the most interesting thing in the entire film, the rules of zombie engagement. The zombies have inconsistent powers as was pointed out by other reviewers. Most of them can't even open a door or knock, but they can smash a window for some odd reason and the last ghost can throw large objects across an Olympic swimming pool. <br/><br/>The acting is OK, but it's not inspiring. All of the actors have much more work to do to better their craft. The affect of nearly every actor except the girl who had her leg shot is blasé. Apathetic. That itself is boring. The backdrop of the city of Detroit is equally unpleasant. That wasn't scary, just sad and depressing.<br/><br/>The film just ends abruptly as if they ran out of money with the second presumably infected boy walking down the street with the previously infected protagonist. The director made the final scene unclear, because although there is a ""being"" following them down the street, it's not clear whether that ""being"" is a human or a zombie. It would've been better to end the film with them running for their lives once again. I don't call that ending mysterious. I call it ambiguous writing. The movie is more like a low budget school project than a serious film (which it was, as they spent $2 million supposedly)."

The movies ending however is pretty inconclusive, leaving you with many unanswered questions that ads to the whole mystery of the brilliant movie. A simple story that is different and well executed.<br/><br/>For a person only new to the whole horror genera, it was not the scariest movie ever. We don't get too involved in what's going on in the other characters lives. Staying focused on the main story at hand (the follower) and they drag this out as the movie progresses, putting you in more and more suspense. leaving us with the follower to think of and not the stuff that is happening to the other characters.<br/><br/>I loved the camera work in this movie, it is different to what is in others and some of it I have never seen on screen. the long turning camera motion featured a couple times throughout. Good way to set the scene and emotion of the characters involved. They do 1 or 2 passes of the environment then focus in on the action. They used the right camera shots at the right time. for example: hand-held; making it seem as though something is about to happen, keeping you on the edge of your seat. the forward shot on road in between scenes, well placed slow- motion and the camera attached to the front of the moving objects.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is average, only a bunch of teenagers in a horror film.

","I have seen some reviews say that the concept is original. There is nothing original about the concept of ridding yourself of a curse by passing it on to the next unsuspecting victim. I suppose it is a tiny bit original that this curse is passed on for sex? Actually, no. STD are passed on this way in real life. Which brings me to the issue of informed consent. Knowingly having sex with someone in order to pass on, in this case, a curse without first informing the person that you have the affliction is called assault. It happens all the time in real life and it's not ok. Nothing original about it. I'm just saying.<br/><br/>Speaking of sex, you have to pass the curse on by sex, and then ""It"" kills people by having sex with them, apparently? It just feels like sex for the sake of sex if there's no explanation. It's the dumbest premise of all time. I just can't. <br/><br/>The whole thing is just boring, boring, boring. I get that it's a formulaic approach, but most horrors like this at least go on to investigate the origin of the evil thing. Why does it kill? Why does it kill in the way that it does? These questions keep the viewer at least interested in the story. Here, there is no story. All we have is some girl running, with the help of her friends, from an entity that walk super slow. There is nothing engaging. No exploration of who might be patient zero or what is ""It's"" motivation. <br/><br/>I didn't find ""It"" to be the least bit scary. I mean, if people can easily outrun it at a speed walking pace, I'm just not that scared. ""It"" moves so ungodly slow, and apparently only does so by walking, that it would be easy enough to just jump on a plane, fly across the ocean, and wait for it to make it's slow a** way across the seas. I know, I know. Not everyone can just pick up and move half way around the world. But if I had some unseen murderous entity bent on killing me, I'd do what it takes. People move around all the time for less compelling reasons. If you can't make it across the world, just a couple hours drive will do to get a good night's rest. Maybe find a job that requires you to fly around the country a lot. See? A little bit of reasoning takes the fear factor right out.<br/><br/>The plan to kill this thing makes absolutely no sense. At the beach, she shoots it and it just stands up and keeps coming. What makes them think electrocution will do the trick if bullets won't? And what exactly is the plan anyway? ""It"" is only getting in the pool if Jay is there, so in order to electrocute it, don't they have to electrocute her? I guess maybe if she's fast enough she can swim to the edge and get out first, but it just seems like an ill-thought-through plan.<br/><br/>I guess Maika Monroe at least does a good job with what she's given. With a plot that revolves solely around a chick running around screaming like a lunatic at an entity that only she can see, this easily could have devolved into ""please just kill her already so as to spare us all from this annoyance"" territory, but it really didn't. Maika managed to not grind on my nerves. Plus one in the acting column. That's why this movie gets 2 stars instead of 1. But that is literally all this film has going for it."

","The idea of passing a curse from one person to another brings to mind the M. R. James short story, ""Casting the Runes"" which was later made into an excellent horror movie called ""Curse of the Demon."" In it, the cursed had to pass on a piece of paper with archaic runes and it had to be accepted willingly by the new victim. In this take on the theme, one gains the curse by having sex with the cursed. They are then ""followed"" by evil entities that only they can see. The movie starts with a girl leaving her house in her nightie, taking off in her car, and sitting on a beach, making one last call to her parents. We then see her mutilated body. The principle character, a pretty young girl, has a relationship with a strange young man. One night, they have sex, and afterward, he chloroforms her and binds her up. He then warns her that he has passed the curse on to her. This sets all kinds of stuff in motion. It is an enjoyable horror movie, given the premise, but there are some plot holes dealing with oversight for these kids and the craziness that surrounds them. They seem to move through their world freely. Also, an event at a swimming pool and its motivation are a little contrived, considering their lack of knowledge. Still, it does a great job of presenting constant psychological threat as the young woman tries to free herself."

","This film has glittering reviews, stating that this is a horror for the new generation, that it revamps the genre and creates something truly unique. Let's get something straight here: awful films are not unique. It starts with our female protagonist going to a film with her new man. After sitting through five minutes of popcorn, organ music and a ridiculous game of 'who's life do you want to swap with?' (a fun game to play when you're meant to be with your boyfriend), said bf gets spooked and they leave. And go have sex. Then she gets tied up and told the tale that now her vagina is wanted by a creepy demon, who will walk relentlessly to get to her newly-anointed paranormal pussy. So if you can drive, charter a boat, get on a plane, even walk FASTER than the thing, you will be fine (there's even a scene where Heroine Girl's Scooby gang actually do this). The film's premise of a walking demon which only the victim can see is solid, if lacking in any sense of direction. The setting is schizophrenic: classic 80s cars for the main protagonists, modern cars dotted clearly around everywhere else; no mobile phones, but the Velma character has a plastic seashell E-reader accessory? Clearly this film never got given a redraft. The characters are unlikeable and badly developed. Heroine Girl is flaky, erratic to the point of insensibility, and must have ADHD to not realize that the walking demon could be outwitted by WALKING IN CIRCLES AROUND HER OWN HOUSE IF NEEDS BE. Her companions are just as irritable: BFF #1 smokes in one scene and never references it again, and that is her character development in its entirety; BFF #2 is the Velma, with her jarring seashell E-reader and insatiable desire to spout monologues whenever she gets her precious seconds of screen time. Final BFF is a guy called Paul, a living erection whose only purpose is to point out that, even though her vagina is haunted by a crazed walking demon, his penis will gladly rid her of that irksome curse. Creepy does not even begin to cover Paul's sociological afflictions. There's also the ubiquitous stoner guy. He has a beach house and a gun and no personality whatsoever. The film's climax is as confusing as it is annoying, and leaves only questions as to how the hell this got an actual box office release. It Follows is a mess of a film, devoid of scares, tension or any semblance of a rational plot. It Follows should have the tag-line 'No Discernible Plot Whatsoever.'

In reading the most recent two pages of reviews, I noted that the majority of them were 1- and 2-star reviews with a couple of 10s thrown in to bring the average up to just over 3 stars, not the 7.4 that is misleadingly displayed in the Reviews heading. The more I think about this, the more I believe that the earliest reviews are most likely written by friends and family of the director and/or producer and/or actors, followed by the honest reviews that a potential moviegoer should really pay attention to.

","Not bad modern horror film represents a respectable effort from writer, producer & director David Robert Mitchell. It's been compared to John Carpenters' work, which is appropriate. In the opening shots, we feel as if we're back in Haddonfield, Illinois (this was actually shot in Detroit). Mitchell gives us a very strange and interesting set piece to open his film, and he and his cast try very hard at giving us characters we can care about. ""It Follows"" may pose a challenge to some members of its audience by daring to take its time. Mitchell holds off on increasing the momentum as long as he can, preferring to create a gloomy atmosphere and a constant sense of creeping dread. This he all does without dwelling too long on graphic violence, which some horror fans may appreciate.<br/><br/>The premise is fairly interesting. Some sort of supernatural force - which is always changing its appearance - kind of attaches itself to certain individuals and follows them around, terrorizing them. Sometimes it even kills them. Our imperiled heroine Jay (Maika Monroe) is the latest person to attract this ""it"", and her deeply concerned friends agree to help see her through the experience.<br/><br/>Folks will dig on the old style synthesizer score by Disasterpeace, and appreciate the widescreen compositions devised by Mitchell and his cinematographer, Mike Gioulakis. They take full advantage of the 2.35:1 aspect ratio.<br/><br/>The acting is low key and sincere from the attractive young cast. Monroe is a personable lead, and she's ably supported by Keir Gilchrist (""Dead Silence""), Daniel Zovatto (""Beneath""), Jake Weary (""Zombeavers""), and Olivia Luccardi.<br/><br/>The ending fails to be very satisfying, unfortunately. This is too bad, considering how well Mitchell creates his mood and feel for about 80% of the film.<br/><br/>This viewer wasn't quite blown away by ""It Follows"" but would consider it good enough to merit a viewing from genre fans.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."

Lets start with the hipster retro worship on display. Despite being set present day, it indulges itself in gas guzzling vehicles, teens watching 50s sci-fi on antenna television sets, directed through a grainy 70s filter and a john carpenter inspired 80s synth soundtrack. Since when did paying homage to your favourite directors or playing with genre tropes become the be all and end all of a successful horror film? Did the director forget he's out of film school and he needs to bring originality to the table? <br/><br/>Moving on, the horror element was basically 'followers' randomly changing one second to the next, with no explanation of why their appearance was that way. Sometimes it's an old man following her, a half naked woman peeing herself, a child looking like a rotting corpse. I'm sure the boyfriend said ""It will come to you in the form of someone you were fond of"" or whatever, so who the hell are these random folk?<br/><br/>Logic seems to have been abandoned throughout the film. Ridiculous decisions made by nearly every character, in nearly every other scene. She runs to and sits on a swing out in the open, IN THE DARK, which is SAFE now for some reason?

","My 20 year old daughter loves horror, ""scary"" movies and, when her boyfriend's not around, drags me along (I ALWAYS pay, boyfriend often goes Dutch). Read a ton of favorable reviews for this film, almost all stressing the following beliefs; e.g., the script is far superior to the teen slasher/supernatural genre; the acting is much more professional, the effects are better than usual, and the ending is chilling. Here's my take; the script is much stupider than genre; the acting is as if hiring chimpanzees, the effects are few and backyard produce-able, and the ending can't even rise to the level of cliché. IT FOLLOWS is not only not better than the average junk of this genre, it's actually worse. Don't waste your time."
"Leofwine_draca","8","7","14","1 November 2015"," Unsettling, lo-fi horror
","Well, here it is: IT FOLLOWS is a wonderfully old-fashioned slice of horror, a chilling ghost story that has much in common with the Japanese horror genre and is light years ahead of predictable, clichéd, American ghost story nonsense. It's a low budget but superior tale with a riveting premise: a girl is put under a curse whereby a ghost will mercilessly stalk her, taking on any appearance, and kill her if it touches her.<br/><br/>The plot is a simple one but the execution is spot on. The scare sequences in this one are really chilling thanks to the fact that they're subtle and straightforward and delightfully fresh-feeling. There's a classic old-school score to enhance the mood and a refreshing lack of CGI spook effects and the like; just creepy actors doing what they do best. I loved how the director has you automatically checking the background of every shot, and the sense of foreboding is next to none.<br/><br/>It also makes a change for the script to present likable and realistic youthful characters without resorting to that annoying and clichéd teen speak. The merciless nature of the ghost brings to mind the classic thrills of a film like THE TERMINATOR. There are a few problems with the film - it's a little overlong, for example - but none of them spoil what is a thoroughly engrossing and superior viewing experience."

And no real reflection on love. I didn't get the scene on the lake with three men in a boat - did I miss something? <br/><br/>On the horror ... The notion of a mysterious, distant figure pursuing with malevolent intent goes back to MR James. Some say the infection element is a metaphor for sexual promiscuity. Meh.

Question: how do they know this? if it had happened before, there would be no one left to pass the story (or the STG) on to anyone else. and if all you have to do is pass it on to someone else how come the first guy (Hugh/ Jeff) that give it to Jay was still seeing the STG after he gave it to Jay?<br/><br/>and at the very beginning there is a weird scene that seems to be from different movie entirely: girl runs outside her house in high-heels and into the street, looks like she's going to back away from the camera (in terror) all the way down the street, then abruptly runs to the other side of the street, runs down the sidewalk back toward her house (but across the street) crosses the street and runs back into her own house. wtf? next she's on the beach at night, telling her dad on the phone that she loves him; the next scene she's dead and mangled on that beach. this was the intro. another question: if this girl is presumably the girl that gave it to the guy (Hugh/ Jeff) that gave it to Jay, how did she give it to Hugh/ Jeff? if she had ALREADY given it to Hugh/ Jeff, why was it still going after the high-heels girl?<br/><br/>i kept waiting for the big reveal but there isn't one."

No himbos or playmates in an exotic locale, just average-looking teens in a blue-collar suburb of Detroit. It has a gritty, low- budget look that fits its setting, without bloody special effects. The cast includes nobody you've ever heard of, though lead actress Maika Monroe appears in this summer's ""Independence Day: Resurgence.""<br/><br/>""It Follows"" upends the horror-morality trope in which the sexually active die first and only the pure survive. In this case, the ""haunting"" literally is a sort of STD (sexually transmitted demon). One passes it to another, who then will be stalked by the zombie-like presence.<br/><br/>Our heroine, Jay Height, has back-seat sex with her new boyfriend (not on the first date). Afterward, she wakes bound, with the now-panicked boyfriend telling her she needs to pass on the haunting to someone else. She's a chick, he basically says; it should be easy for her to find another guy willing to have sex. He urges her to do it quickly, too, because if she died first, the haunting would revert back to him.<br/><br/>The moral dilemma, then, is whether she should do unto others as he did to her – or, with the help of her friends, find some other way to shed the haunting.<br/><br/>###<br/><br/>Stu Robinson practices writing, editing, media relations and social media through his business, Phoenix-based Lightbulb Communications."

","A lonesome girl sitting in a classroom, looks outside on the schoolyard. A moving white shape can be seen far away. The girl doesn't at first notice anything odd about it, but after a while it's clear that the shape is a human being heading straight towards her. In panic, she grabs her things and quickly leaves the classroom.<br/><br/>It Follows is written and directed by the relatively unknown David Robert Mitchell. It's about the girl Jay, who after a sexual encounter with a guy, ""gets infected"" by some sort of curse that starts to constantly follow her. It Follows is a low budget film made with only 2 million dollars, a small sum in today's measurements. Interestingly though, Paranormal Activity and Blair Witch Project were made with only about 20 000 dollars. Money isn't everything in the world of horror films.<br/><br/>In the beginning of It Follows we follow the story mostly from a distant. The camera never really gets close and we feel more like a spectator, not really involved in the story. Later in the film we get drawn deeper in and our spectator role changes to a subjective perspective. Joy's perspective. This enhances the effect of the curse that's following her. In the beginning we were one in the crowd, watching, but later we turn into the one looking for the stalker in the crowd. The music in It Follows is very electronic and feels like a mix of David Lynch's companion Angelo Badalamenti and Giorgio Moroder. It really enhances the creepy feeling that lies like a cloth throughout the film.<br/><br/>It Follows leaves me both impressed and disappointed at the same time. It's well crafted and the for me totally unknown cast does its job acting like typical teenagers in a horror flick. But, I still think the film falters a bit in the middle, and then even more towards the end. Once the story is laid out for us, it's like the film gets stuck. Where should we go next? This in turn seems to lead to more classic horror film clichés being used, which is a pity because the film started rather unconventionally. The ending does save the film, and without saying too much I do like it when a film leaves room for interpretations and personal thinking.<br/><br/>David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se"

Regardless of what one thinks of the plot, It Follows was a carefully thought-out and well executed work of art.<br/><br/>There's a certain dreaminess to this film that I couldn't get enough of. I felt like I was having a bizarre nightmare, and while I wasn't exactly looking over my shoulder when it was over, there was a sense of foreboding that stayed with me long after the credits began rolling. I thought that it accomplished what it set out to do-- this movie didn't intend to make people scream or rush out of the theater, but maybe it made them double-check the locks on their doors that evening. <br/><br/>""It"" wasn't a terrifying monster. It's abilities were ambiguous, the rules it operates under were never fully explained. It was exactly what it said on the package-- it follows, and it never really stops. The idea doesn't sound like much at first, but watching it walk slowly and unwaveringly towards the main character, Jay, brings on a slow realization of how terrible it truly is. And seeing her fear, desperation, and complete helplessness quickly adds to the growing horror."

","Horror, like may genres, seems to go through trends. What was once classic monsters films such as Dracula (1931) and Frankenstein (1931) became unkillable maniacs chasing teens (played by 28 year olds) to their inevitable and, might I add, creatively gory demises (Freddy and Jason, you scamps, you). Found Footage movies resembling the Youtube Generation's preferred method of receiving media spawned from the trend setting The Blair Witch Project back in 1999 (if you don't feel old, lucky you). Or the Torture Porn crassness of everyday characters tortured for the pleasure of another everyday character (not a fan myself). Occasionally, a movie will come out which breaks the mold of convention, standing out from the the status quo. John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) and Alien (1979) are examples of pictures that took common conventions and integrated them into a new style. Using Sci-Fi, Horror, desolate locals, and a unknown entity bent on chaos, as well as the greatest plot device, ""Who can you trust?"" they allowed us to be there with the characters and learn along with them. To sympathize with the plight as our own worst fear boiled in our bellies.

","Unfortunately, I wasn't able to suppress my curiosity, so I had read about the plot of 'It follows' here and there, before watching the film. Now, I've seen it three times, and even though it has its good share of (brilliant) moments, it's not the modern horror masterpiece I was hoping to find.<br/><br/>The main problems are that the plot drags on at times, and the rules of 'it' and how it operates, are somewhat unclear and confusing at times. For one, it would be quite simple to avoid 'it' forever: when it comes close to you, get in a car or plane or boat and go far away and so on. Then, 'it' seems to be unable to go 'through' people or things, but it can - seemingly effortlessly - navigate through crowded places like cinemas or schools without touching anyone - yeah right. Also, if 'it' can be easily exposed by throwing a blanket over it, that would give any victim (and their friends) the opportunity to expose it to the world (which may not help in itself, but now the police and the parents are quite helpless anyway). But... I know from experience that such details should not be looked into too hard, since horror movies are essentially metaphoric entertainment, like fairy-tales were (and are) as well. 'It' seems to represent death, which reveals itself to youngsters who had lived carefree up until then. Through sex, they lose their innocence and become aware of their vulnerability, their mortality). Coming-of-age, stuff like that. Personally, I wouldn't link it directly to venereal diseases, but if people must...<br/><br/>Beyond that, I would have chosen to leave out the first scene (which felt like the obligatory horror intro - who really needs it in a film like this?) and begin things with that innocent adolescent Jay, and how things slowly begin to fall apart - more mystery, less horror. The pool scene in the end was the obligatory finale, but didn't work much for me, either. I really liked the contemplative, atmospheric ride that this film was most of the time (photography!, acting!, soundtrack!, it's all wonderful! - except for the occasional, truly clichéd, 'monster'), and so it's really easy to be lenient, but 'It follows' is - I must warn you - not perfect.<br/><br/>5 or 6 or even 7 out of 10 seems fair, but this is quite a special film to me, in spite of what I can say against it.

From then on ""a bad spirit from Jehovah terrorized him."" Having withdrawn his spirit from Saul, Jehovah made it possible for a bad spirit to gain possession of him, depriving Saul of his peace of mind and stirring up his feelings, thoughts, and imaginations in a wrong way. Saul's failure to obey Jehovah indicated a bad inclination of mind and heart, against which God's spirit offered Saul no protection or resistive force. However, since Jehovah had permitted the ""bad spirit"" to replace his spirit and terrorize Saul, it could be termed a ""bad spirit from Jehovah,"" so that Saul's servants spoke of it as ""God's bad spirit.""

You never find out why it is terrorizing these people, what it wants, if it can be destroyed, or what it even is. The movie started out great, atmosphere was good, and even the acting was okay but you leave the theater with more questions then answers. The movie has a defined beginning a bit of a middle and no end. Everyone in the movie theater was extremely disappointed when the credits rolled. Do not waste your time or money."
"filmfanperspective","7","10","24","5 May 2015"," Wildly entertaining, but not a masterpiece
","Considering the sheer volume of filmed material that has been produced over time, it seems rather unlikely that 100% of a new film will ever be wholly 'original' again. Audiences are used to seeing and knowing everything- in fact, the box office tells us that they prefer their films to be familiar and unoriginal. That being said, credit is due David Robert Mitchell for It Follows. Sure, it is a horror film, and on the surface, it appears to be rather typical. Young people, sex, demons, and bad decisions flow freely here, like the many that have come before. Call it an homage, ripoff, remake, or whatever works for you, but I'd rather call it like it is- a good, tense horror film. It owes everything to prior films, yet deserves praise for how well it is made, and how earnest it is whilst presenting a tried and true premise.<br/><br/>Allow me to be cynical for a moment, and tell me if you've heard this one before: a young, white female named Jay (Monroe) from suburbia starts to fall for a guy (Weary) who may or may not be dangerous. Well, he wears an earring, and he's brooding, so I suppose he's dangerous. They have yet to consummate their romance, or so the film tells us, but one fateful night, they do. It doesn't turn out well for her. Hugh (if that's really his name) wants to show something to her, so in the middle of an awful, rundown lot of a rundown building in Detroit, he ties her to a wheelchair as something walks towards them. He can see it, but can she? If she can, it is proof that she's now the prime target of a being/monster/demon. It will walk in her direction, no matter how far, until she is dead- unless she passes it on my having intercourse with someone else. Then the being/monster/demon will chase that person, and so on. The film's established rules for this being/monster/demon's powers are hardly concrete, but we'll get to that later.<br/><br/>Mitchell gives us some interesting parallels to the trauma these characters experience- whether he meant to or not. Think about the horrific personification of sex in general. How many of us have had the guilt-ridden ""black cloud of sex"" follow us around (nearly like an inescapable demon)? Be it the way we were taught about it, the way our various religions forbid us from thinking about it, or perhaps an awkward or bad first experience- sex, as fantastic as it may be, is quite possibly the scariest monster of them all. This is a film that carries this enormous burden of sex, and we feel the weight of it.<br/><br/>Also consider Mitchell's use of the city of Detroit, as the group of friends often passes south of ""8 Mile Road"", encountering all of the urban decay. Consider the clear metaphor for sexually transmitted diseases, specifically AIDS, and how one moment of seeming innocence and bliss can literally haunt you to death. Playing off our existing fears and building tension is what the film does best. The being/monster/demon, whilst occasionally grotesque, is not what turns our stomach- rather, the probing of our mind and the fear it can create seems to be the target.<br/><br/>I did have reservations with the script's penchant for changing the being/monster/demon's powers at will. The rules can be difficult to follow; it can change its' visage to resemble anyone, including those known to the victim, which is convenient to throw off the audience. We don't know how it can do this, but only the true anal retentive viewer (like myself) cares why. Also, it can apparently only walk, not run, directly toward its' target, but in one particular scene, it pounces on a victim as if injected with puma blood. In another scene, it can pick up inanimate objects and throw them. If it touches you, you'll die, but apparently it's fine if it only grabs your hair. I care about these only because I want to know why supernatural beings choose to do some things but not others. Just like other horror films before it, why slam doors and stand in corners if you can kill your target? I suppose that wouldn't be nearly as much fun, and ultimately it doesn't keep the viewer from enjoying the film.<br/><br/>As I finish this review, I'm now clear that It Follows is one big tense metaphor wrapped in an homage for the modern audience. If the film hadn't been treated with such delicate care, it may have been easy to dismiss. We'd simply throw it on the scrap heap with the latest exorcism film or Hellraiser entry. Instead, Mitchell and the cast have created something that may not be original, but most certainly is memorable. Some critics have gotten a bit out of hand with their praise for the film and its' unconventional yet familiar score by Rich Vreeland (also known as 'Disasterpeace' apparently), calling both ""game-changing"" or ""groundbreaking"". The static-laden bass notes in the score certainly work, but are the closest things to original I heard from it, and the MIDI-inspired crescendos don't call anything other that Carpenter's Halloween score to mind. Hyperbole aside, I can easily recommend the film to anyone interested in more than a simple slash and burn horror experience. It has nothing new to offer, but the method of delivery is certainly different, fun, and worthy of our time."

","I saw this film as a screen unseen, so I had no idea what I was going to watch. Having said that I had read some reviews on this film and when it showed up on the big screen I thought I was in for an interesting film experience...<br/><br/>How wrong I was. The film opens with a slightly bemusing scene, with no cues or explanation as to what is happening or why.<br/><br/>The rest of the film then carries on as it started, with even more scenes of incomprehensible and borderline laughable sequences of 'it following'.This is accompanied by a score that has to battle through the dire script and lack of real physical tension by being excruciatingly loud to at least make you feel uncomfortable if not scared.<br/><br/>The photography and cinematography in this film are it's only redeeming features. You can see that it tries to be a good indie film in the way that it's shot, And the film has lots to offer if you want over an hour of, admittedly quite pretty, 20 to 30 second long panning shots of derelict buildings in Detroit.<br/><br/>Overall this film could be summed up as 15 minutes of jump scares smeared in-between one and a half hours of pictures of Detroit suburbs with strange 70's eire electro music played loudly over the top.<br/><br/>More like 'It fails' than 'It follows'"

","How this movie ever got a 7.2 rating is one of life's great mysteries. It is actually rated higher than The Babadook, which is truly an original premise that is executed brilliantly. ""Executed"" being the key word. It Follows is confusing, laboriously edited with random irrelevant scenes, has a soundtrack from a really cheap 70's porno film and worst of all not scary. Why does everyone think this garbage is some artsy masterpiece. I haven't seen so many pointless reaction shots since 1960's Star Trek! This drivel's creator, David Robert Mitchell, has forgotten the first rule of film-making: NEVER BORE YOUR AUDIENCE! And that is all he did for the longest 100 minutes of my life. Endless anticipatory shots that not only didn't move the story forward, but squeezed the life out of what little story there was to tell. (I kept hoping for an early mercy killing.) It Follows was a paltry attempt at film making that failed at every turn: somnambulistic actors who wander through a cinematic labyrinth of missed opportunities, choppy editing that brought attention to itself and away from the skinny storyline, amateurish attempts to create a malevolent environment, and a reprehensible plot that continuously confuses the viewer and drove me into the kitchen for another beer.<br/><br/>I'm just praying that It Follows is not followed by another abysmal attempt at film making. Man, if this passes for good horror, then all is lost!"
"david6995","2","33","103","7 May 2015"," Did I actually just finish watching the same film as everyone else?
","This is probably the second film I've ever reviewed on here (and I've been an IMDb member for many years now). The reason I've felt compelled to do so is twofold: first off, I can honestly say without the slightest amount of exaggeration that I'm a ""horror moviephile""; I've probably seen most all of the horror films ever made during the past 40 years from all over the world. Despite the risk of coming off sounding pretentious, I really and truly know the horror genre.<br/><br/>The second reason I've decided to review this film came down to the utterly horrible disconnect between the word-of-mouth rave reviews this film got (along with all of the assorted ""best horror I've ever seen"" tripe that I've hear strewn forth from many a source) and the actual material.<br/><br/>Well, I'll try to be as non-hyperbolic as possible. After watching the film, I literally...and I do mean LITERALLY... had to check to make sure if the film I just got done seeing was the same one that garnered all of those positive reviews. Apparently it was?!?! I don't know where to start, but I'll try. It was very slow and boring, and was not, and I do mean NOT suspenseful or frightening at all. In fact, I got to the point where I was even begging for a cheesy and cheap jump-scare, just so that I could feel something other than boredom, even if it was just for a moment. But no, not even a jump scare.<br/><br/>So here we are: no gore or special effects to speak of, no suspense, no horror, no interesting plot (actually, no real plot to speak of more involved than the game of ""tag, you're it!""), no likable or realistic characters.... can someone PLEASE tell me how this film managed to garner so many positive reviews???? How???? How?????????? To be fair, as I stated previously, I have seen most all horrors out there, so perhaps I may be jaded... but if any of you are interested in a REAL horror film... one that actually lives up to the genre's name and that will remain with you for a long long time, watch ""Martyrs"". ""Martyrs"" is the nigh-perfect exemplar of and opus which exudes ultimate shock and horror. Coming in behind ""Martyrs"" is another gem called ""High Tension"". I think that aspiring horror directors/producers should be required to at least watch those two films before they even consider working in this genre.<br/><br/>For risk of this review turning into a ""Martyrs"" love-fest, I have to say that Martyrs is the ultimate epitome of a horror film, and even though I'm just about 39, I think that I will see out the rest of my life without experiencing any greater thrill that I felt when I saw Martyrs.<br/><br/>Anyway, who knows? In my shock and disbelief, my research was not that extensive, so I may actually find out that I have been pranked, and that I have just got done watching counterfeit instead of the actual ""It Follows"" film. If that is the case, I promise I will come back and edit this post. Until then, I have to slowly walk away in utter disgust and disappointment in how such a film which I had so much wonderfully high hopes and expectations for ended up leaving me feel empty, cheated, and disillusioned."

To the point now.This movie lacks of plot, and furthermore i cant say that it gains something from the director's point of view. Below average acting and the whole movie is an ''incomplete idea'' of the screen writer. For me the whole movie was just a bad effort when trying to be innovating. Cant rate it more than 3 or 4 stars when i've got in mind movies like Dans ma peau (2002), A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014), Spring (2014), Midnight Son (2011), Martyrs (2008), Rec (2007), Haute tension (2003) El espinazo del diablo (2001) and much much more, apart the classic horror top rated movies.

His name is actually Jeff Redmond and he tells them that night of sex had transferred the curse from him to her. He suggests that she transfer it to someone else.<br/><br/>This is not that scary but it is very interesting. The camera stays too far away from the walkers. I actually found the walkers scarier when I can't see them. It is still a fascinating idea. I love the swimming pool scene especially when it starts to take off. I love that the audience can't see the walker while Jay is pointing frantically at him. It is a rare sexually transmitted ghost story. The idea of being unsure about people walking towards you is terrific. The big scene that I truly love is when Jay relents to have sex with Paul. It's completely unexpected. It's a moment of utter defeat for her. She can't take it anymore and has to pass on the curse. This is a great idea for a horror."

It slowly creeps towards you, no matter where you are located and it can't be stopped! The maiden film for David Robert Mitchell has excellent camera work. It was smooth and crisp with great angles that made your eyes search for what is coming. The score was dark and it fit perfectly with the film. Some sequences would not work without it. As for the acting. The young cast did quite well. The director and writers made sure that the adults of the movie took a back seat. Leaving the teens to handle their own problems and confront this horrible force by themselves. This film is definitely creepy and it keeps your mind guessing on how it will end the entire time. Don't expect tons of action and there is little blood. This film is hugely based on suspense and it delves the minds of the young and shows an eerie response to their actions. I recommend a dark environment when watching."

I no longer trust Rotten Tomatoes judgment. I've seen a lot of bad horror movies, but this was probably the most disappointing. It felt like a movie Coach Carr (mean girls) would have shown, ""don't have sex because you will get a sexually transmitted demon and die"". Another thing I didn't like was whenever the camera slowly turned, the scene would get a bit unfocused, it wasn't like a blur, it was like when you screw up a panorama and it stretches things out a bit.

"bricemavillaz","2","22","70","5 June 2015"," Slow, boring, with a stupid premise
","I guess you have to be american and under 16 to feel invested in this movie.
Being european, i don't have the point of view americans have on underage sex.
Unmarried sex before marriage being a big no-no is not a thing that really exists in europe.
However I can get the metaphore for STD's. My point is, europeans don't really have this ""taboo"" thing going on with sex...for us there's just no big deal around sex.
That pretty much invalidates the stakes in this film. Furthermore when you think about it the premises can't really work, and the film takes a lot of liberties with its own rules (eg sometimes the ""thing"" can interract with objects, sometimes it can't...most of the time appart form its target no one can see signs of its presence...but sometimes they can)
The characters lack personnality, are flat and really unappealing. Cardboard cutout american teens we've all seen a million times before with no real characteristics or character traits that sets them appart or makes them sympathetic.
The threat is...well, not very threatning throughout the movie. Any threat that can be countered by just running is pretty much a non-threat.
The movie's supposed to be tense throughout but again, if the threat isn't really threatning...the tension is just not there (furthermore, if you don't really care what happens to the protagonists because you can't identify with them...that ruins the tension even more). A retiree wearing a flower dress, wether their eyesockets are dark or not, slowly walking towards you, is not something you run away from.
Obviously I didn't really ""get"" this movie, to me the message ""no underage sex kids, it's bad"" just doesn't work when you've been done with puberty for a while. If you already had sexual intercourse with more than one member of the opposite sex : this film just doesn't speak to you.
So yeah I'll go ahead and say it : unless you're a teenage WASP american who never had sex before, this movie has nothing going for it.
Much too specific of a target audience to be appealing to a global audience.
This is just an over-rated teen slasher flick. You have to actually be a teenager to find it appealing...if you're over twenty it just feels really immature and prudish, but most of all really, really boring. The pace is FAR too slow and the threat just doesn't exist. So you're just left watching moronic and unapealing teen clichés running around for the whole movie, which isn't really interresting to watch.
Yet another mediocre run of the mill movie over rated just because it's premise dares to somewhat step out of the ordinary redundance we're used to seeing in horror movies. And once again, if the premise only works for a small portion of the population...well you're just left with your average ""teen has sex and gets chased throughout the movie by a paranormal thing that wants to punish them for it"". Eg : your typical boring and unoriginal b movie teen slasher trope."

Then you watch it and realise you've seen it all before.The same jump scares, the same whispering dialogue to create a more effective scare later on, the looking under the bed, etc etc. <br/><br/>'It Follows' is something new and creates psychological tension & horror. It is actually a very simple idea, almost childlike - but it delivers and is one of the few movies that kept me looking over my shoulder or checking the garden before my walk up the stairs to bed.<br/><br/>What I loved most about 'It Follows' is that the nightmare never stops. The characters are never safe, be it during the day or at night. The scariest bit could potentially be in broad daylight in a busy town, or in a packed classroom during school hours. It could come at any time."

","A young woman has sex with a guy she barely knows and finds that she is now followed by a supernatural entity that takes on many forms but is invisible to anyone who hasn't been ""cursed."" I was really happy to see this and have some proof that creative horror isn't completely dead. Mostly dead maybe but not completely. If I had to see one more found footage movie or another subpar remake of a classic, I would scream. This is a very cool and very creepy little horror movie that feels retro in some ways while still being fresh and clever. Good cast, script, and direction. Love the music score by Rich Vreeland (I refuse to call him by that stupid pseudonym). I just can't imagine the movie being anywhere near as effective without his score. I like that this doesn't give the viewer all the answers and leaves us with some mystery. I know there will probably be a crappy sequel someday that will explain it all away and ruin the whole thing but I really hope, for once, they can leave well enough alone.<br/><br/>I do have a few quibbles, mostly about the second half. The main gripe being the decision to make the ""it"" of the title something that can be physically touched and hurt. This seems like a misstep that most likely came about because director/writer David Robert Mitchell couldn't think of another way to end the story. To me, it worked better when ""it"" was an incorporeal phantom rather than an invisible shapeshifting creature. It didn't ruin the movie for me but it did contribute to a somewhat underwhelming climax considering how good the buildup was. Despite that, this is a fine atmospheric horror movie; one of the best the genre has seen in years. Definitely recommended for people who want more than 'guts & gore' from their horror."
"CleveMan66","1","48","177","28 March 2015"," ""It Follows""? It's stupid! (Read this and more constructive criticisms below!)
","The possibility of contracting AIDS. The large number of sexually transmitted diseases. The fear of upsetting your parents or offending someone's religious beliefs. The risk of unexpected pregnancies. Jason Vorhees' rampages in the ""Friday the 13th"" films. You would think that young people have had enough warnings about the dangers of premarital sex. Apparently not. ""It Follows"" (R, 1:40) is a horror movie that seems to touch on most of those issues. Or is it none of them? Read on – and I'll try to make more sense than this movie does.<br/><br/>The movie's title can be seen as part of an argument in logic, or simply a statement of fact. For example, ""Most professional critics seem to love this movie, so it follows that nearly universal praise should be met with skepticism."" In the more literal sense, ""It"" does indeed follow. ""It"" follows anyone who has sex with someone who had the curse passed to them by someone else. It can look like anyone – even someone you know. It might appear to you naked, or partially clothed, or fully clothed, but only those cursed can see It. It doesn't move very fast, but It will always find you and, if It gets a hold of you, It will kill you – unless you have sex with someone else and pass the curse on to them first. But if It kills the cursed person before the curse is passed on, the curse reverts to the previous person. The film's opening sequence shows us just how scary the curse can be.<br/><br/>Then we meet Jay (Maika Monroe). According to her friends ""it's annoying"" how pretty she is. When Jay goes on a date with her new boyfriend, Hugh (Jake Weary), they have sex in the backseat of his car. Afterwards, he reveals that he has passed on to her something much more dangerous than your average STD. He has been followed by It and, in his attempt to shake It off (apologies to all Taylor Swift fans), he has passed the curse on to Jay by having sex with her. He advises her to pass the curse to someone else as soon as possible, he explains the rules to her, he shows It to her (It shows up right on cue), he drops Jay off in front of her house and then disappears. At first, her sister (Lili Sepe) and their neighborhood friends (Keir Gilchrist, Daniel Zovatto and Olivia Luccardi) don't understand why Jay is acting this way, but soon find themselves risking their lives to try to keep her from losing hers.<br/><br/>""It Follows"" is just dumb. And I'm doing more than just calling names here. I have many questions whose answers (if there are any) reveal how dumb this movie really is. (Warning: Mild spoilers follow.) Writer/director David Robert Mitchell contradicts himself throughout his movie. If the curse is supposed to be symbolic of STDs or just the dangers of premarital sex, then why set up the curse so someone afflicted with it has to pass it on to be free of it? And if It isn't supposed to symbolize any of that, why is this apparition so upset that people have sex in the first place? And where did it come from? Mitchell has said in an interview that the movie was inspired by nightmares he had as a kid and that the problem in the movie can't be solved any easier than you can solve a nightmare while you're in the nightmare. If so, where's the clue that all this is a nightmare and, if it's not, once again, where did It come from and why is It so obsessed with sex? If the cheesy generic horror music, old neighborhoods and old TV shows are supposed to recall the 1970s, then why insert a single piece of technology (an E-reader) that obviously comes from the present? And if the movie takes place in the present, why have generic 1970s horror music, neighborhoods and TV shows? But wait, there's more! (More mild spoilers) Why have a character learn to shoot a gun as a way to fight a supernatural specter? (Aren't they usually impervious to bullets??) When one character has an accident, why choose to have him/her break an arm, then have that character wear a cast and then put that character in water three different times? If someone in the movie comes up with an idea to kill It and the idea doesn't work, why continue to play the scene as if the audience should still be sacred? If a character begins to pursue an idea of how to pass on the curse, why cut away from the scene and never show or say what happened with that plan? Oh, and kids? If you're trying to hide from a very persistent ghoulie which will find you wherever you go, why choose a house in the woods right next to a lake? Have ANY of you seen any horror movies? Ever?? Okay, I better stop now before veins start popping out of my head! I usually don't get so wrapped up in movies' plot holes and logic flaws, but when they are so frequent and so significant as in this movie, they begin to consume anything that is positive. And there is positive here. The premise is fairly original and well, that's all I got. ""It Follows""? It's stupid! ""D"""

","I wish I could have found just one thing positive to say about this film, but there's nothing. Not a thing.<br/><br/>The beginning made it look so promising, what an absolute let down.<br/><br/>The score was as annoying as a mosquito buzzing in your ear, only much, much louder.<br/><br/>Now if someone can please tell me where all these high ratings and reviews came from, that would be great. I was fooled into watching this, purely on that, and I feel cheated.

"svenjergensen","7","2","3","27 June 2019"," Creepy!
","After being bugged by everyone and their brother to watch this movie I finally caved. I'm not really big into horror films because I don't like cheap thrills. Thankfully this movie has none of that. It relies souly on tension and fear of the unknown. The camera work in particular really helps build an atmosphere of uncertainty. I know lots of people talk about how this is a good throwback to 80s horror, but honestly I don't see that. The 80s used blood and gore to get the audience scared. This uses silence and pensiveness to create a dark mood and atmosphere. I do see how lots of people think this is an allegory for STDs and I think if you watch it with that deeper meaning in mind you will find it more enjoyable. My big hang up comes at the end of the film. It doesn't really feel like it end. We don't know if they beat the monster or not (probably not if they want a sequel) and that open-endedness just doesn't work for me here. The other big hang up I have is the same with all horror films: if there is a monster why not alert the cops? There's plenty of evidence for it and no doubt you could get some extra help. Overall I don't think their plan to stop ""It"" was a great idea either but now I'm just nitpicking. Great for some good tense scares!"

"ellissmith8","3","2","3","21 February 2019"," How can anyone watch this movie and actually think it makes sense?
","I went into this movie pretty excited. I've been on a massive horror binge recently so after hearing so many good things about 'It Follows', I was pumped to see this. Lights off. Midnight. Big TV. Alone. Awesome.<br/><br/>What followed was a cluster of utter nonsense, sparse appearances by the least scary monster I've ever seen on screen and plain boring dialogue.<br/><br/>First I will say, the soundtrack was decent. Cool 80's carpenter style synth soundtrack, can't go wrong. Apart from it did go wrong, because despite the music itself being really nice, it did not fit the tone of the film at all. I feel a more standard modern orchestral ST would have fit the bill better.<br/><br/>Acting was alright. I feel bad for the cast as they didn't exactly have a great script to work with. The characters were boring, vapid middle class kids (?) with absolutely nothing to say to eachother. The friend (not the sister) with the dark hair and glasses - why on earth was she even in this film? What actually was her purpose apart from to make a few ironic remarks and act completely nonchalant about her friend being stalked by whatever the thing was meant to be?<br/><br/>Which brings me on to exactly that. The monster. What an ill thought out premise and antagonist. The first scene shows the audience a girl being killed brutally on the beach, her leg almost snapped off and mangled. Awesome, this is going to be horrifying. Nope, we have a monster that WALKS in a straight line until it gets to you and then kills you. Wow alright, so our protagonist surely just gets in a car/bus/taxi/plane/unicycle/skateboard and heads off until it catches up and repeats. Safe. Nope, she decides on multiple occasions to corner herself in an assortment of rooms and buildings so the only defence she has against this monster - fleeing - is rendered impossible. Smart move.<br/><br/>So she can't run because she's too preoccupied with cornering herself. So she has another option. Just as it was passed to her, she can bang someone else and then the monster will follow them instead. BUT if the next person is killed then it will just go backwards through the chain of sex partners killing them all. So cool we have some rules on how this thing operates. This is what confuses me. So the guy who slept with her to pass on this curse knows this, and tells her this, because he had it passed on by some other girl. A one night stand he says, where he was so drunk that he cannot even remember her name. So how on earth does he know all this??? He was drunk to the point he can't remember her name but somehow she told him about this curse and he can remember that? What? I'm assuming he wasn't told by this fleeting partner, as surely he would have tracked her down, so has he just figured this out somehow? Absolutely stupid nonsensical was of explaining the rules to the audience.<br/><br/>The film goes on like this until the end. Every 5 minutes watching this film I found myself saying 'What?' out loud.<br/><br/>Why did she sleep with the random sleezy guy in the HOSPITAL??? Was he that desperate to bang her? Like surely this guy would stay well away even if there was an inkling that what she was saying was true.<br/><br/>Why the hell did the other dude (the 'nice' guy) sleep with her later on??? To show how much he cared about her??? Absolutely obscene.<br/><br/>That ending... wow... why on earth did they think it was a good idea to put her in a swimming pool and surround the pool in assorted electrical devices and plug it in? So they could lure the monster in and electrocute it? What could possibly go wrong? The dude at the beginning who gave her the curse even said 'its slow but not stupid'. The monster wasn't stupid, but the characters certainly were.<br/><br/>Where were the parents in this movie? 5 kids running around up and down the country, windows getting smashed, car crashes, one of them even gets shot. What the hell?<br/><br/>My favourite part of this movie was when the leads friend asked her 'what does it look like?' and she says 'I don't wanna tell you'. Here I was thinking we were going to see some absolutely rotten vile monster. It was a well kempt dude in shorts. Wow. Scary stuff.<br/><br/>Honestly I'm done writing about this, this is the first review I've written but I was just so appalled by its own stupidity that I felt impulsed to write my thoughts out.<br/><br/>Don't watch this film. It stinks."
"courtney72288","9","2","3","28 October 2018"," Not like every other today's horror movie
","I rarely give reviews, but had to with this one after just recently seeing it. I really thought the whole idea behind this movie sounded dumb, so didn't bother watching it before. After hearing so many good things about it though, I decided to give it a chance, and this one got to me. I grew up watching horror movies, and never really get nightmares, but this one gave me chills. I could barely sleep that night after watching.<br/><br/>I won't give any spoilers, but knowing there is something out there constantly slowly following you,and will not stop until it gets you, no matter where you go really freaks me out. I wouldn't say it's the best horror movie, but it is one of the better ones I've seen today. It doesn't rely on cheap jump scares, not much CGI, has a good soundtrack, the acting is decent, and is not an 'in your face' type of horror. It's just chilling, which gets to me more than anything.<br/><br/>Everyone's different.. I'm sure there are people that would find it lame, or boring... But if you're like me, and it's the little things that scare you instead of monsters jumping out at the screen at you.. Then I think you would like. Even if you're not a fan of the story, this movie definitely has it's moments, and some creepy scenes. Would recommend"
"spookyrat1","4","2","3","18 October 2018"," A Major Disappointment!
","I wouldn't normally even bother to review a film already critiqued by 800+ contributors, but I was so disappointed by It Follows that I found myself gravitating towards the keyboard, to express my feelings of surprised dismay.<br/><br/>Touted regularly as a ""modern classic"", those expecting another genuinely original film such as Get Out! should be prepared for disappointment.<br/><br/>The main narrative premise of a ""viral villainous curse"" passed between teenagers, has most obviously and best been seen in The Ring saga. The story therefore can claim no great pretensions to originality. But the way it is presented to the audience is completely and frustratingly daft.<br/><br/>Consider: 1 The virtual complete absence of adult support characters. These school going teenagers have apparently no parents from whom to seek advice or get some help. They appear to just about all live in Jay's house. Convenient I suppose, but realistic? 2 The (adult) police can't find Hugh/Jeffrey, but our teenage posse can. Sure! 3 Many have already noted the absence of any explanation at all for the existence of the curse (a major point of difference with The Ring). I could probably live with that, but curiously again there seems little police involvement with the associated deaths, such as we see in the film's introduction. 4 Jay's continually bizarre behaviour is something to behold. She always seems to be running out on her buddies, even when they get shot/injured attempting to help her with naturally, precious little thanks. 5 And what's with the two main male friends trying to bed Jay when they know she's been cursed? One even quite hilariously mounts her in her hospital bed, when she's recovering from a car crash. Shades of David Lynch! It makes little sense. 6 As do the ""its"", when in one scene bullets to the head cause only a minor inconvenience, whilst in another scene, we're expected to believe it's finished one off. Duh! 7 As for the so called symbolism of ""purposely"" highlighted superseded technologies and SF/Horror references ... seriously what was the point? In your face stuff, that's all been done before in much better films.<br/><br/>It follows therefore that I strongly advise you don't bother."

","While there are SOME redeeming qualities about this movie - the editing is OK and there are a few beautiful shots of nature/suburbia - most of it just lacks any kind of depth, tension or horror. Right off the bat I found the premise really stupid and it never really takes off from there. The acting was like what you would expect from amateurs trying their best, not The Room-level of awful but not very good either.<br/><br/>It would seem that people who gave this a full or near full score must live in some strange parallel universe where horse manure taste like chocolate pudding. That is seriously the ONLY thing I find eerie about this movie - the near psychotic levels of hype.<br/><br/>I'm 43 years old. I love psychological horror. The Shining is my favorite horror movie of all time. This... I don't even know how to describe it. It just lacks everything that makes a great movie."
"RussHog","9","2","3","19 January 2017"," Brilliant Monster Movie
","It Follows is a movie about a monster that is an STD. If you catch the STD - it will follow you as your worst fears until it catches and kills you. The only way to escape the monster is to pass the STD on to another person. If the monster kills the other person - it will come back for you. The monster is ruthless - cruel - intelligent - and a master of fear. Scary!<br/><br/>The story is told like a dream - where the rules of the world change slightly as the story goes along - much like how in a dream the rules of the dream will transform and become more abstract as the dreamer get closer to waking up. Some people have complained about the story changing - but I felt it was intentional and pushed the story forward. <br/><br/>The tale is also told in a timeless manner - for example - it seems like the 1970's but there is a seashell that one of the young teens uses as if it is a cell phone - or a computer screen. This shows that the world exists in ""any"" time - it can be the past, present, or some future. Or some dimension. Or - some dream. <br/><br/>It seems to deal with the Jungian theme of the innocent - which is to say - that the fear of the innocent in the Jung archetype is to be in trouble. To be caught. This is a film about innocent people who step forth into the world and are afraid of their actions coming back to haunt them. Much like all of us are at one time innocent - and take the first steps into being an adult - and fear what may come from that breakthrough. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is eerie - and it makes the movie feel a bit like The Shining - or even There Will Be Blood. The shots are well set up - and in general - the movie is just a masterfully unique experience. I love monster movies and I loved this one. A good monster needs to have a scare that is relevant to a majority of the population and a story that engages an audience. It Follows does just that - and deserves its praise."
"tmdaines","5","2","3","21 March 2016"," It Follows (2014 - David Robert Mitchell): **½
","With allusions to STDs and all else that casual sex entails, It Follows is a promising piece of Cronenbergian body horror that falls flat at the end. The setup is remarkably simple and the threat is unsettling: to rid yourself of the stalking demon picked up from your last sexual encounter, infect another. The film is at its best when it allows the presence to slowly draw closer to its intended victim, rather than relying on the lesser interesting slasher aspects the work sometimes falls prey to. After a chilling first hour, the climax of the film sorely disappoints. While we could plausibly believe that the enemy is purely an intangible supernatural presence, perhaps a figment of the imagination, a physical confrontation at the climax takes away much of the trepidation that the film had built up during its opening two-thirds. Despite its potentially hokey setup, the story never felt cheesy until the final encounter."

","Lets face it, its probable you are not going to be buying this movie on blu-ray for £20 in HMV. Its more likely this will be picked up in Asda for a fiver. Thats where films like this end up in the UK.<br/><br/>That said, its pretty good as these films go. What is quite obviously a low budget film without (the need for) mega-special effects works really well thanks to a group of pretty good actors and actresses and it's great 1980s soundtrack. I've mentioned John Carpenter film scores in other reviews - this one sounds like it's straight out of Halloween 3! Really sets the scene for an hour and a half of doom, threat and a predictable but wholly forgivable outcome. If you know the movie series 'Ring' you'll know what to expect. Its all been done before in every decade but sometimes it can be pulled off without the need for frills.<br/><br/>The film dispenses with ridiculous blood and gore and relies on the 'threat' element from the do-badders walking around the neighbourhood of the film's setting. The make up on the creatures present seemed questionable at the start but when we got to the bit (spoiler alert) where a 7 foot tall Lurch-lookalike silent malevolent suddenly walks through a dark doorway, even I jumped out of my seat and decided blood, gore and evil sound effects were not actually needed.<br/><br/>Definitely a watch, but don't pay over the odds.

"williambendavis-933-218958","8","10","28","8 April 2015"," A truly great modern horror film
","Out of the horror movies made in the 2000's-2010's that I've seen, I think this is the only one that I would call great. The film doesn't really put a strong focus on scaring you to death, but more so puts a focus on creeping you out and giving you an anxiety attack for an hour and forty minutes. The premise of the movie is that there is this thing, ""it"", if you will, and ""it"" follows you. It will never stop following you and if it catches you, then you're dead. It can look like anybody. It could be someone you know or a random person in a crowd. The only way to get rid of it is to have sex with someone else, but if ""it"" kills the person you gave it to, then ""it"" will come back for you. The one benefit (I guess this is a benefit) is that it only walks toward you. It doesn't run or teleport. It simply walks. You can probably see why this movie makes you more anxious than terrified based on this premise. The entire time you're thinking ""Is that it? Is that the thing?"". It'll drive you nuts, I guarantee it. This movie does a lot of other things right as well. The director has said this movie was supposed to be a nice throwback older horror movies and he did it quite well. The soundtrack sounds like it came straight from the 80's. It reminded me of Halloween the most. Not only does the soundtrack just serve as a throwback, but it also sets the tone of this film perfectly. It makes certain scenes 10x creepier. Thankfully, there wasn't the ""car won't start in time of need"" cliché and there were no slutty characters. Both are rather small things granted, but I'm happy they weren't annoyingly stuck in the movie. Only issue I have are with the rules of ""it"". You get ""it"" from having sex with a person who had ""it"" following them. Okay, fine. But what if it's gay or lesbian sex? How would that work? What if it's an animal? Or a dead body? Does oral count? How about anal? Do you get it from the penetration or from ejaculation? In the end these questions don't really matter, but I would have really liked to get an answer. Ah, it doesn't affect my opinion of the movie too much. I'd still say go see it."

","It Follows has a high degree of original content in its set up: the originating premise is stark and bold. Imo however that is by far and away the best feature of this horror film.<br/><br/>Even this though has the unfortunate defect of inviting speculation as to the immediate metaphorical meaning of the 'sexually transmitted misfortune'.<br/><br/>There remains the decided possibility that it's just a good way of making the mechanics of a slasher teen horror film unfold as usual; and we are dealing with a neat and direct take on a writers crafting of cause and effect upon their story and their characters.<br/><br/>Another possibility is that it's a direct filmmakers reference to the well known trope of this sub-genre to use youngsters getting frisky as a means of imperilling them at the hands of a monster that has used their 'distracted' state to get into an attack position!!<br/><br/>A trope which is often over-analysed by film critics and fans as having moralistic rather than mechanical meanings.<br/><br/>At times, particularly in the initial encounters with 'It' a good eerie atmosphere is generated; and this lasts for a fair while into 'It Follows'.<br/><br/>Sadly as the plot proceeds most of this good work meanders and becomes formulaic with unremarkable straight forward exploitative shocks and 'nasties'.<br/><br/>This left me less and less impressed and less and less sympathetic to the protagonists and to the film as a whole.<br/><br/>My final rating is a strong 4/10.....with some recommendations but overall I'm not going to say that I enjoyed 'It Follows' any more than that; by the end I found it to be simply serviceable slasher horror"

Whole idea of story having a deeper meaning through references to literature and sex being both the cause and cure of problem is just so unnecessary and the whole thing would have worked a whole lot better if it was made in the vein of old movies, like, for example, ""Carnival of Souls"". It all boils down to the fact that this movie isn't fun and isn't scary. It feels creepy at few scenes, but that can't help it from falling below my bar of mediocrity. I give it 5.5./10.

The issue is the action could have been improved on. There was very little character development and we basically found out what ""it"" was and that was that. There was no more to what this force was or why it wants to kill you. However, I understand this may have been relating to STDs which would explain it.

The atmosphere of the movie is very low as was intended with the developing plot. But some of it logically does not make sense. When you are building a creepy, scary movie the plot has to be believable in the actions and intents of characters. Or you can go the other way to make it a scare jump movie to make you not question it and if done well can work. This just moves on very slowly. Comes to for me a comical climax which tries too hard and does not fit in with the intended suspense of the rest of the film. And the very ending of the movie and I even want to consider it was feasible.<br/><br/>4/10 comes from me for the actors and the attempted writing, filming and direction of the movie.

I thoughlly enjoy all including when they're running away from ""It"" that try's to kill them at times, the opening shot and ending scene are very intriguing and messed up in the best way. The cinematography is also done very good, the shots linger and hang on to the scene and it's cool. The scene that get me is the scene when she's touching a flower and then she gets kidnapped, that legitimately scared me. Now enough praise, there's something that this movie fails in, suspense. The suspense is lower GREATLY due to the fact that it's literally an invisible and slow creature. Something about that greatly lowers the film, the acting is either passable or at times good, the characters are forgettable aside from the main character and that one skinny guy. Aside from simply knowing them, they have no unique character traits. In conclusion, it's still a good film to look at and become submerged in but certain qualities and can take you out of it. 8/10"

","'It Follows (2015)' is the best horror film of 2015, primarily because it's much more psychological than many others in the genre. It isn't terrifying - or even scary, as such - but is skin-crawlingly creepy in a long-lasting kind of way. It's a slow-burn with a keen focus on tone that prefers building genuine suspense over portraying overt gore. It's the deft handling of a unique 'monster', one steeped in - but not consumed by - allegory, that allows it to be as effecting as it is, with the inherently scary premise combining with it's arresting visuals and superb score to a suitably subtle but certainly supreme effect. 8/10"

"Councillor3004","Null","1","1","19 January 2018"," Modern horror rarely gets any better than this.
","""It Follows"" belongs to a small number of original and inventive horror movies released during the 2010s so far, turning into an immediate modern classic by paying homage to the golden age of horror during the 1980s with its incredible cinematography, the suburban setting and the chilling score. Maika Monroe has been born for parts such as this; I recently watched her in ""The Guest"", an incredible indie thriller which was released the very same year as ""It Follows"" and is just as fresh and exciting when it comes to aspects such as thrilling atmosphere, memorable storytelling and vivacious characters.<br/><br/>Many reviewers on IMDb appear to complain about the film's narrative, including the way the 'monsters' slowly walk up towards their victims without ever appearing to be a danger to them. I would love to see those people constantly being stalked by bloodthirsty creatures which never seize to follow you. The only flaw I could find with the film was the choppy editing, as it gave some of the scene changes an awkward feeling and took away from the narrative's fluency. Apart from that, ""It Follows"" is as good a horror film as you can imagine finding within its genre, especially in recent years since ongoing franchises such as Saw, Final Destination, Halloween or Texas Chainsaw Massacre have flooded the horror genre with their trashy sequels.<br/><br/>With the recent hype surrounding ""Stranger Things"" and the Hollywood remake of ""It"", it has been turning into a trend to pay homage to horror movies from the 1980s, and ""It Follows"" is an almost perfectly executed example for how to do such an homage correctly. Horror movies should not be about the scares only, and David Robert Mitchell understood this when he directed ""It Follows"": These movies should be about suspense, fear of the unknown, fear of what lurks in the shadows or what may be following you from afar. The film's 'monsters' embody exactly that: by letting them slowly wander towards their victims, the effect of possible jump scares gets replaced by a rising amount of tension, becoming more and more unbearable throughout the course of the film as we approach the final scenes."
"Wuchakk","9","1","1","12 January 2018"," Horror in the Detroit area, but maybe... love conquers all
","RELEASED IN 2014 and written & directed by David Robert Mitchell, ""It Follows"" chronicles events in the Detroit area when a group of suburban youths have to contend with a strange curse spread through loose sex wherein the victim is followed by some THING, unless s/he passes the curse on to someone else.<br/><br/>This movie shows what a talented filmmaker can do with only $2 million, a competent no-name cast and a brilliant composer (Rich Vreeland). In tone & quality the movie's akin to 2008's ""From Within,"" but more haunting and less talky, not to mention without the awkwardly overt commentary on Christian legalism vs. wicca. The film scores good marks in the female department with Bailey Spry (""Annie"" in the prologue), Maika Monroe (""Jay"") and Lili Sepe (""Kelly""); Olivia Luccardi too (""Yara"").<br/><br/>COMMENTARY ON MAIN THEME (Don't read until you see the movie): The premise isn't juvenile at all, as some clueless critic suggested. In fact, it reflects real life as the potentially fatal curse for loose sex is akin to venereal disease, albeit spiritually rooted. It's the casual-sex-equals-death motif of slasher flicks but deeper. The ""monster"" in the movie represents the repercussions of meaningless sex, which may be physical, psychological or spiritual, but there is a price to pay. Two of the characters are childhood friends and their union is the antithesis of casual. Note the subtle yet potent climax. <br/><br/>In addition, there are interesting subthemes to be gleaned, like the safe suburbs vs. the danger of the rundown inner city. <br/><br/>THE FILM RUNS 1 hours & 40 minutes and was shot in Detroit and the surrounding region (Sterling Heights, Berkley, Northville, Troy and Clawson,). <br/><br/>GRADE: A"

","If you, like me, look up ratings on IMDB to decide which films are worth watching, there's a chance you could miss this gem. There's a lot of people who apparently didn't like this movie. Let me tell you why: because It Follows is different from what people got used to when it comes to horror. It is a slow walk, not a rollercoaster ride filled with jumpscares at every turn. This film understands that horror isn't about that, it's about an idea, something that activates a primal instinct of survival deep within your brain. It Follows is about imagination, it is about what you don't see, what you don't know. So many horror movies make the mistake of trying to explain everything, where the monster comes from, what are his motivations, his abilities, etc. It Follows understands that there is value in mystery, that it makes things so much more interesting and terrifying. The film relies on the viewer's imagination to fill in the gaps, and it then either confirms his/her expectations or subverts it. Sadly, not many see it this way. Some think the film must give you all the answers, or tie up all the loose ends. It doesn't."

","Is it too early to say there is a renaissance of horror movies going on? One thing is for sure: in the last few years we've experienced more than a few smart, well-made spookies coming from the US. And it's such a big relief to see that, apparently, the sh*t-show of endless jump-scares seems to be kind of over. So, alongside the fairly good ""The Conjuring"" and the fairly great ""The Babadook"", we can now add to the list of good American contemporary horror ""It Follows"": as the previous two, in fact, it shows what a good script, creative directing and pretty solid performances can do to the genre. Starting from the script, it has a beautiful simplicity to it: there's a non specified entity that follows the cursed and if ""it"" gets to them, it kills them; only way to get out of it is to pass the curse on to someone else through sexual intercourse. Alongside this thin but solid premise, Mitchell showcases simple, credible dialog and well-rounded characters. The chosen stage for the story is the declined city of Detroit: another spectral aspect that perfectly fits with the ghostly presence of the title. Sure, the group of teens that form the core characters of the movie are nothing short of the classic stereotyped nerds, jocks and so on, but they are enriched with a sort of ambiguity and uncertainty in their actions that's almost never seen in this genre. It's also noticeable how Mitchell leaves some important moments in the narrative out of the viewer's reach, with underlying meanings. It is not easy to work as an artist and not as an exploiter of mindless teenagers looking for a thrill in the horror industry, but Mitchell and his team worked out an unflinching film, that doesn't care to be too innovative, and yet modernizes classic '80s style creeps. It (see what I did there?) may not appeal to more gore or shock oriented moviegoers, but it's their loss. And it is because ""It Follows"" is the smartest horror in years.<br/><br/>8/10"

The main actress Maika Monroe did very well but the rest of the cast is rather lacking. I also thought the ""leaving the suburbs"" scene was a rather odd inclusion. It was very preachy and just felt entirely out of place next to the rest of the film. It kind of took me out of it a bit moving forward.<br/><br/>What I did love was the anachronistic feel of this, almost as if the viewer is watching someone's dream. This, coupled with a score very reminiscent of John Carpenter, fitted perfectly with the ambiance of the film, makes this a very refreshing horror movie.<br/><br/>One question I have is what exactly is the message of this movie? ""Don't have casual sex or it could lead to your demise?"" I suppose it is a warning against STDs and advising safe sex but its not exactly clear what we're meant to learn.<br/><br/>The throwbacks and homages of this horror film reminded me a lot of The Guest (also of 2014 and also starring Maika Monroe).

Production values are a bit cheap, but, if anything, that helps the movie, giving it an authentic, gritty feel. Also means the director has to rely on plot, improvisation and getting the most out of his cast, rather than throwing large amounts of money mindlessly at special effects, which is a very good thing.<br/><br/>The cast are all unknowns and put in solid performances.

I have read a few reviews and tend to agree with the typical common conclusions of those which score at the lower end; the ""entity"" against which the protagonists face is left as either vague or inconsistent (or both) in terms of the threat it poses and how it can be stopped, the chronology of events does not make a great deal of sense, there is a lack of emotional attachment to most characters. The score and subject matter do give a sense of unease and tension which intrigued me to continue watching and the concept is original, however I feel that the execution could have been more cleverly thought out and, due to confusion and inconsistencies, I was left feeling underwhelmed."

""It Follows"", scares you not because of monsters, possessed nuns, or creepy dolls, but because mixes up the fear of casual sexual encounters and paranormal activity. <br/><br/>Main Character Jay, for me, was a typical dumb horror movie main character. She does the exact things Jeff tells her not to do, Every time. She's just too stupid. But that's how horror movies work sometimes.<br/><br/>The last 10 minutes of the movie I wondered how the producers would finish all the mysteries around ""It"" in just a couple of minutes, but at the end I found out that was never in their plans.

","""It Follows""! Yes, it does! My grandiose corny puns in my movie reviews, and this one is no different! OK, OK. Please don't leave and I beg you to continue to follow me in my review of the horror independent flick ""It Follows"". Writer-Director David Robert Mitchell has formulated a very inventive horror movie about an unknown supernatural force that follows some of those who have sexual encounters. Our protagonist here is the blonde beauty Jay Height. Jay reaches her own new heights when she starts dating the all-American sporto Hugh. But Hugh will not guess what happens with that encounter, because then if I spill the beans, it will be a Hugh disappointment, and spoilers will follow. Sorry, but I can't resist. Hugh ends up giving Jay the supernatural force that causes weary characters to slowly follow; hence ""It Follows"". It might sound like ""It Follows"" is not it, but it is actually a very engaging movie, that does not mimic most of the formulaic hum-drum horror movies of these days. And it does have its scary moments, including a breakthrough beginning. So I think we should start following the career of David Robert Mitchell because he was it in crafting this feature. I also liked the leading performance of Maika Monroe as Jay. The rest of the cast was moderate but nothing to follow through profusely. OK, that is pretty much it. Now follow ""It Follows"". **** Good"

","The indie scene is where horror lives today. Forgot the twentieth Halloween reboot or the January dump truck that unloads all the mid-budget horror flicks that the studio wants to die quietly. The past few years have given us Oculus, The Witch, Don't Breathe, and admittedly the return of M. Night Shyamalan to elevated B-movie form. Micro-budgets and filmmakers eager to subvert the genre are giving us some of the most well-crafted scares that we've had since a creative dearth gave us seven Saw movies.<br/><br/>What elevates the best of the best with supernatural horror is a willingness toward social allegory. Our worst fears are the ones that hit closest to where and how we live. Cabin in the Woods and You're Next started the trend by slyly flipping the game board and suggesting that moviegoers are too clever for the same old song and dance. Enter It Follows, which takes a simple premise (a demon is slowly coming for you) and elevates it to sexual assault allegory. The demon is passed like an STD and can only be gotten rid of temporarily by passing it on to someone else. This raises questions about self-preservation. What lengths would you go to in order to prolong your life, but doom somebody else? Under the perilous and terrifying circumstances, taking up the ""doom somebody else"" sword isn't hard. Fear is a powerful motivator. Like an STD, passing it on won't save you though. It only ends up buying you more time. It's a hamster wheel situation. Death comes one way or another.<br/><br/>Shot and performed with a delicate grace, It Follows steeps everything in a palpable terror. Its anachronistic setting complete with e-readers, tube televisions, classic cars, and a complete lack of cell phones is an ever-present reminder of the characters' futility. It's a perpetual post-recession dystopia full of dilapidation, overgrowth, and despair. And backed by haunting synths, it's a pall that never lifts.<br/><br/>Like the demon that lumbers with deadly inevitability, It Follows stays with you.

","In a time where horror movies are known for being full of predictable jump scares and horrible acting, It Follows breathes new life into the franchise through excellent acting, a very haunting atmosphere, and an original and frightening ""villain"". One interesting attribute of It Follows is its homage to original horror movies like Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street. In fact, the main ""villain"" of It Follows represents most classic horror icons due to it always moving at a walking pace. One distracting issue of It Follows is ""the rules"" which, due to not being fully explained, ends up being very distracting. Let's begin by talking about the strongest part of the movie:<br/><br/>1.Atmosphere: The atmosphere in It Follows is what makes this movie truly terrifying. The haunting atmosphere is present throughout the whole movie and there isn't a time where It Follows shifts the tone. This tone is the strongest in scenes where the main character isn't moving due to knowing that ""It"" is getting closer and closer while the main character isn't moving.<br/><br/>2.Characters: Perhaps one of the weakest part of modern horror films, the characters in It Follows are very strong and well-acted. Perhaps the best part of the characters is how relatable they are since the main character is suddenly thrust into a situation that she didn't want to be involved in. Also, the movie cleverly hints that the main character could be considered the monster as well due to being forced to give the curse to someone else to avoid dying.<br/><br/>3.""It"": The idea behind ""It"" was really clever and original. While ""It"" being described as walking doesn't make it seem very intimidating, it slowly becomes more and more intimidating as time goes on and the main character begins to lose her guard. However, the way ""It"" kills the person with the curse is weird and kind of over-dramatic and the fact that ""It"" doesn't have a true form is disappointing.<br/><br/>4.The Rules: Perhaps the weakest part of the movie would be the rules. While interesting, the rules can be pretty distracting due to some alternative scenarios not being answered. Also, even though the film clearly states that ""It"" is always walking towards whoever has the curse, there are at least two scenes where ""It"" is either described or shown standing still.<br/><br/>In the end It Follows is a clever horror movie that focuses on conveying horror through tone instead of cheap jump scares as well as making very relatable characters that don't act very stupid for the most part. The homage to classic horror movies is also a nice touch (even if some scenes are clearly meant to be homage instead of being connected to the plot). <br/><br/>Final Verdict: 8/10"

","Some movies simply put me to sleep. Sergio Leone's ""Dollars Trilogy"" is a great example of one where it took a few separate viewing to make it through. It Follows turns out to be another. <br/><br/>I don't know if it is the leisurely pace, the lack of action, or the nebulous antagonist but it worked like a knockout gas on me. The movie's premise is actually quite good. If you sleep with someone an unstoppable monster will chase you until you sleep with someone else and then they will chase them and so forth. <br/><br/>The solution to such a curse seems fairly straightforward, particularly for an attractive blonde teen girl. Go to a swingers club in say Las Vegas. Since the monster moves at a simple walking pace by the time it reaches Vegas you will have twenty or so partners at the very least ahead of yourself. <br/><br/>Alas, it wouldn't be a horror movie if the characters spent five minutes thinking of a logical way out their predicament. So instead she and her Scooby gang spend the movie making sure the ""monster"" can find them. <br/><br/>The movie has some very effective scenes and set pieces. It is certainly not a bad film at all. The mixing of styles and technology give a dreamy sense out of time. The acting is naturalistic. I think maybe I am just too old for the movie. <br/><br/>For example one of the main characters is the childhood friend who holds a torch for the protagonist and who has stuck by her side as she has dated others who use her and throw her away while he sits from afar and painfully pines. I am old enough to recognize this as a classic ""nice guy"". I am also old enough to understand this is a fate worse than any monster. <br/><br/>Maybe this movie is scarier than I thought."

","""It Follows,"" directed by David Robert Mitchell, (who from his IMDb picture looks like he should be a character in his own movie, but I guess that makes sense) starts out as having no purpose other than paying tribute to the original ""Halloween,"" from the seemingly self-composed synth-keyboard soundtrack (which I realized can be injected into any movie to instantly create an ""80s throwback"") right down to the ""Laurie Strode"" AKA ""Jay Heights'"" gaze through the high school class window while the teacher prattles on about a passage from Keats that can loosely be applied to the theme of the movie. Thankfully what ""follows"" is actually pretty thought provoking though at times for the sake of the story. <br/><br/>The premise of the movie is this: there is, let's call it an ""affliction,"" that can be passed from person to person. How is this ""affliction"" passed, you might ask? Well, you have to have sex to get rid of it. What is the ""affliction?"" No matter where you are, someone will steadily be walking towards you to kill you. <br/><br/>Now, reading this description makes the symbolism of the movie only slightly more apparent than actually viewing it. Still, it's an interesting idea, and ""It Follows"" takes it pretty far. What could have been a run-of-the-mill ""startle-fest"" became one of the first modern horror movies with substance (there have only been maybe, five, in the past twenty years, though I await dispute on that). It's really a shame that the director felt it necessary to include scenes more fit for the cerebrally desert cash-grabs aforementioned than digging further into his own style for the scary stuff. That could have been really good. <br/><br/>I think the main issue with ""It Follows"" is that it puts the idea before the enjoyment of the viewer. Philosophically I can't completely disagree with this, I'm actually surprised that a movie like this reached mainstream markets in the era of multi-billion dollar raising superhero movies. It's just that right when it gets good, it seems to sell out with the (for lack of a better term), ""paranormal activity"" scenes. <br/><br/>The vigilant viewer will notice the antagonist is not the ""sex zombies"" (i.e. rape victims) but actually the attractive bad-boy friend (a friend that is a boy) of the main character who uses her vulnerability of needing to rid herself of her affliction as an excuse to score, despite the fact that he doesn't even believe her up to that point. <br/><br/>This is one of those movies that you probably need to watch more than once or twice to really appreciate. On it's face, it's obvious what the message is. Seeing the way Mitchell takes the premise further and further into the maze it what's really interesting to see and think about after."

","A 1 out of 10 is so much more than this film even deserves. First off let me say that I am a huge horror movie fan, and after hearing all the rave reviews about ""it follows"" and how it was an, ""Instant Classic"" I was excited to see the movie. The movie grabs your attention right out of the gate as the camera follows a seemingly terrified girl being chased (as she runs in high heels, forget the Nike's, when i think speed i think high heels) before getting in her car and driving to the beach only to be left mangled and dead by the next morning. From that point on my was attention was never grabbed by the film again. The plot is filled with holes and barely makes any sense to begin with. If the so called ""it"" can take the form of someone you know then why the hell is it always in the most obvious ""im coming to kill you"" form possible? The movie is basically an anti-teen sex PSA. The director also goes for some kinda ambiguity in terms of the year or time where things take place, but one second they are watching a TV from 1950 and then the next some girl is on a cell phone and you can see modern day cars driving around while the only cars the characters are ever in seem to be older cars from the 70s. The score is a cheap imitation of the original ""Halloween"" in the way its used to build suspense only for nothing to actually happen. Nothing is well explained or makes much sense throughout the movie. And that friend of hers Paul is a great big pussy. This kids been dying to bang the main character, Jamie, since they were kids, yet she's always banging someone else. Then he finally gets her when he knows he's gonna get followed by the stupid ""it"" thing anyway. This review is all over the place and not exactly a work of fine literary art but this movie was so damn terrible i had to make an account on here just to vent about how awful this movie was. The critics who say its great are idiots, they're the kinda people who like something just because everyone else doesn't so that they can make you think they are smarter than you, but they're not they are just schmucks. This movie is basically Samara from the ring only in std form and she's trying to rape you to death. I also couldn't help but feel like it was just a movie made by a hipster to show how hipster and cool he was. Well guess what? Hipsters suck and so do you Mr. Robert David Mitchell. Do all of us horror fans a favor and stay the hell away from the genre from now on. If your thinking of seeing this movie, think again. Taking your 15dollars for a movie ticket and shoving it up your butt would be a better use of the money than going to see this drivel. Best part of the whole movie? The trailer for insidious 3 before that train wreck of a sad excuse for a movie even started. Shame on you ""It Follows,"" and Robert David Mitchell and all of you critics and morons that found anything about this film redeemable."

","I don't usually write reviews because usually I don't have that strong of feelings toward the film. I either liked it, loved it, or could find some redeeming qualities about it. That being said, this film did not deliver for me. I enjoy being scared by the things that go bump in the night in the safety of a theatre. Now, the start of this film was unnecessary and could be scrapped completely. The scene shows an unnamed girl running out of her house across the street and then driving away to a beach where she calls her parents and tells them she loves them. Then its day and she's been mutilated and is dead. I figured this scene would be explained later on it the film. (It wasn't.) Then the scene goes to the film's main character Jay. This is uneventful until she goes to the movies with her boyfriend Hugh. They play a game and he sees someone no one else does. This is the ""it."" After realizing Jay can't see the person, he rushes her out of the theatre claiming he feels sick. A few dates later they have sex. He then tells her he passed ""it"" to her and all she needed to do was pass it on so it didn't kill them. The movie was extremely disappointing with musical cues put in wrong places and no end to the jump scares. I've been scared more by cheesier and crappier films than this one. This one had no real plot. Where did the ""thing"" come from? Why is this happened? Why can't it be killed? Why couldn't Paul (I had to look that up because the characters weren't memorable.) see it after it scratched him? What was the point of showing that if nothing was going to happen? That could have been scrapped too, as it was even more unnecessary than the first scene. What bothers me most about this is that there was SO much hype for it. I went in a little nervous because it was supposed to be the ""scariest thing since (place any horror film here because I've heard a myriad of different things.) and it turned out to be really bad. I went in expecting something great and came out really disappointed. I read the reviews and see a lot of people saying it was a ""smart"" film. But I didn't get any of it. Maybe I'm just a dumb movie goer who doesn't know anything. But if that's the case, then this movie is even worse than I'm saying it is. You cannot create a movie that no one will understand, first of all. And if it was supposed to be a horror movie, you have to have more than just jump scares and incorrectly placed music/vocal cues! This movie could have been fleshed out and told a lot better. It seemed to me that is was the start of a story. Like the writer went to someone and said, ""I want to make a movie about a thing that follows people around and kills people if they don't have sex."" And then literally did that without fleshing out real characters or story line/plot. In my opinion this movie was a total waste of money and really should have waited a little longer. If we thought that the horror genre was failing, this is only going to make it worse."

","I attended to this movie in MotelX festival, and I was really excited about this one. Haven't seen the trailer (i suppose there isn't one), but the reviews were all pretty positive, so I thought I was going for a nice little indie movie.<br/><br/>I was so wrong... the movie opens up pretty well, but from there on it's a downhill. We have an entity with sinister purposes that is passed by sexual intercourse. If it kills the ""host"" than it will follow the previous one, and the only way to pass the ""curse"" is to have sex with another person. <br/><br/>It's not a very intelligent premise at all, and all the ""hosts"" could have passed it to a hooker or something and none (perhaps only the last one) does it. We don't know how the ""curse"" appeared, what motive does it have... the movie makes absolutely no sense. And it's not even scary, it relies on cheap jump scares, and it gets to be ridiculous at times.<br/><br/>The performances and photography aren't bad, but the script is so poor that gives me chills.<br/><br/>Really one of the WORST movies I've seen at a Film Festival, and I have seen many."

Nice boyfriend passing on this curse to a girl that trusted him. He chloroforms her, and then ties her to a wheelchair, and then tells her in not so many words, ""I screwed you, and I really screwed you."" You only just see that dude one other time, repeating what he told Jay in the beginning of the movie, and then poof, he's gone. Then, she's running around crying and screaming trying to pass it on to others. Did she really have to have sex with every male featured? She almost screws those men on that boat. There's no explanation on where It came from, or how to kill it. I didn't even know that she was seeing her dead father during the climax of the movie. There was no fleshing out the characters; no nothing but a slow burn, and an ambiguous and anticlimatic ending. To sum this all up, I have seen far better horror movies than this one."

Amateurish, immature, poorly made, poorly written. Growing up isn't scary. It its best it's conflicting. Sex isn't scary. Losing virginity isn't scary. What child mind thought this is in any way interesting? The only thing this movie managed was making me want to watch Polanski (and I really hate Polanski, so good job, movie). The acting is dreadful. The whole plot is handled as though the main character was at least violently raped. The director/writer is a very immature person. He handles the loss of virginity as violent and traumatizing act which causes PTSD, depression and self hatred. His constant reminder of 'being a child was the best thing which happened to me, growing up is awful' coming out of mouths of these spoiled rich privileged people is borderline insulting. He handles sex as something disgusting and scary. Is he just THAT frustrated? Also, one more point, character writing. Who are these people? What are their names? Why should I care about some spoiled white trash girls sipping their Starbucks lattes? Why should I care about ANYONE in this movie? Not a single reason has been given. I watched this movie because of the strangely conflicting difference between the rating scores and the reception in reviews. After finishing I know one thing for sure - every single positive score given to 'It Follows' was bought or faked. These which weren't must have been given by similar child-minded people terrified of growing up. Very sad, very disappointing, very poorly made little film. The best I can say, and that is still extremely far-fetched, is that the music wasn't bad."
"AggressivePizza","1","3","6","26 August 2016"," That one scene in Toy Story is scarier than this whole movie. I am not exaggerating.
","Wow, this movie is something else. To start, the fact that it's claiming to be a horror film is borderline insulting to the viewer considering it has absolutely nothing remotely unsettling in its one hundred minute duration. Honestly, this film is so aggressively not scary that I'm impressed the director somehow got a studio to sell this as a horror movie. Seriously, who would genuinely get so petrified by some dude that incessantly follows you at half a mile per hour? Hasn't the guy who wrote this ever been to Baltimore?<br/><br/>Anyways, besides the complete lack of scares, the film also fails on nearly every other level. Both the cast and the monster are forgettable in every way. I can't decide which characters are given less backstory: the adolescents or ""It"". All the viewer knows about these elements are the humans' names and the mechanism by which ""It"" is transmitted. That's all. Why should I be rooting for the characters if the writers purposely made them so surface-deep?<br/><br/>Concerning the film's style and tone (which critics apparently couldn't praise enough), I thought it was lukewarm, although I will admit the score was the one thing I could begin to attempt to use the word ""good"" to describe. Unfortunately, no film can subsist on style alone. There is so little substance in this movie that I actually checked if I had accidentally chosen the wrong movie, given the above-average expectations that the critical acclaim caused me to have.<br/><br/>To sum it up, this movie is unbelievably bad, not because it was irrevocably lame and boring, but because there was nothing positive to glean from this film. If there was a message, I missed it. If there were scares, I missed them. If there was a beginning, middle, and end, I missed it. At least Eragon (2006), a similarly awful production, made me appreciate the source material a little more. This film gives its audience nothing. I am convinced that the ultra-high 97% fresh rating ""It Follows"" has is a practical joke. There is no way that is legit.<br/><br/>Don't see this movie.

I laughed a lot, and I do think a great message of asking partners if they have anything before having sex is smart, however, I'm unsure why a full movie needed to be made around it. Anyone claiming this to be scary or a ""classic"" are clearly missing these points, which makes this movie even more ridiculous.

""It Follows"" does not rely on cheap jump scares and tension is key to the plot, however considering it is a horror movie, it wasn't particularly scary. Yes the creature and the many forms it took were unsettling, but I never really found myself in a state of fear. <br/><br/>The main character Jay, portrayed by Maika Monroe gave a convincing performance, however the other ""background characters"" came off as one dimensional and somewhat useless. My main gripe was the behavior of the character Greg who refused to believe in the creature's existence, even after the beach scene in which Jay is lifted in the air by her hair and a door is broken open by seemingly no one. I find the fact Greg refused to believe the creature existed rather odd, considering the events that had occurred right in front of him.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is decent enough to watch if you have nothing else to do. However, to consider this movie a testament to horror as some user and critical reviews have suggested would be overestimating it. It didn't do enough to keep interest, and aside from the main character, the rest were rather dull. <br/><br/>If you're looking for a scary psychological horror then look again.

"ebola13","9","5","13","21 July 2015"," It Follows - Raw Review
","I hate it when I'm late to the party, especially when everyone is raving about how much fun the party turns out to be. In any case I finally had the opportunity to see David Robert Mitchell's new horror offering It Follows and I'm kicking myself for not seeing it sooner. The web is full of reviews gushing about It Follows. How much it adds to the horror genre. How surprising it is that a low budget film is so provocative. How such a simple idea can be so scary.<br/><br/>It Follows is proof that simple ideas can make the best horror movies. The premise of the movie is incredibly simple. Jay, played by Maika Monroe (The Guest, Labor Day), learns that she's been infected after having sexual intercourse with Hugh, played by Jake Weary (Zombeavers), and now the infection is following her.<br/><br/>Infected with what you ask? That's a great question!<br/><br/>Call it a curse. Call it a spirit. Call it a demon. Call it anything you like because any explanation is as good as another. What's important are the rules. The thing following you is slow, but it's not dumb. It is always coming no matter where you are, it's always moving toward you. If it gets you then it comes after the person who infected you, then right on down the line. It can look like anybody and only those infected can see it.<br/><br/>It Follows is a beautifully crafted gauntlet of fear, tension, and horror. Many comments online claim the film is slow and boring. Not enough action. Sleep inducing. Nothing special. Yada yada. Take my word for it, it's one of the most intense films horror-thrillers since Sinister. Don't let the slow, moody manner of the characters fool you, this movie will stick with you for days. Like an albatross hanging around your neck, you won't be able to get the idea out of your mind. Between Mitchell's direction and Monroe's sympathetic portrayal of a young woman put in an impossible situation you'll find yourself engaged in the story, feeling like you're there next to them.<br/><br/>I watched the movie with my wife, sister-in-law and mother-in-law. All of them enjoy horror movies, but every now and again a film comes along that has them all (including myself) yelling at the television. It Follows is one of those movies. All of us felt Jay's burden as she waited for the unknown horror to arrive, again and again and again. We'd yell at the screen if we spied what we believed to be the creature, arriving deep in the background. Getting closer and closer as the characters are focused on anything but their surroundings.<br/><br/>The film capitalizes on this premise with excellent cinematography. From the very first scene it's clear we are meant to see more than just the characters. Mitchell wants us to see the environment, the background. A very clever set-up because it lulls the audience into complacency. By the time Jay learns of her plight we're already used to the long shots and wide panning camera angles. This makes the first time she sees 'It' even more powerful and creepy.<br/><br/>It Follows is a brilliant film. David Robert Mitchell takes an extremely simple idea and through some deft direction, exception camera work, and provocative soundtrack is able to inject the the film with the most powerful elements of multiple genres. Horror, monster, thriller, and coming-of-age. Thematically the movie is all about the discomfort of adolescence, love, and emotional insecurity."
"alheere","3","17","63","7 June 2015"," It Follows; Contains spoilers
","Horror is my favorite genre. Period. I am down for a good horror flick any day, and after hearing all the amazing reviews about It Follows, I HAD to see it.<br/><br/>Lets start off with what I liked about the movie: The cast/characters: The acting in this movie isn't by any means the best, but for a bunch of people I've never heard of and don't have much of anything on their resume, it really wasn't bad. The characters themselves I found to be likable, I didn't want them dead within 5 minutes of starting the movie (cough 'Chernobyl Diaries' cough), which is a big deal for me.<br/><br/>It: I found the premise of 'It' unique. 'It' is simply something that looks like a person (you may or may not know) and it tries to kill you. I enjoyed the fact that 'It' never moved faster than a walk, so it is easy to out maneuver, but the fact it will always find you is the creepy part.<br/><br/>Now for what I didn't like: Everything else!<br/><br/>The fact that you could 'pass it on' to temporarily get rid of it was interesting, but seriously? Sex? All the cool and unique ways you can pass on a curse and you chose sex? I was highly disappointed. I understand the 'well it means you can get it from anyone at anytime, because everyone has sex', but for me it lacks something.<br/><br/>The stupidity of the end 'fight scene'. You've already shot the stupid thing multiple times, in fatal areas and it didn't die. What part of you thinks it's A) a good idea and B) going to actually work if you electrocute it in a pool?<br/><br/>The sound track to me was generic.<br/><br/>The script was OK.<br/><br/>There were parts that weren't explained and added nothing to the movie. The first one I can think of is with Greg after he and Jay have sex. It's just him sitting at a table in school talking with unknown girls. What was the point in that? The next one is where Jay takes off most of her clothes to presumably swim to a boat with a couple guys on it, then cuts back to her driving home. Seriously, what happened? Did they forget to cut those parts when they were editing the film?<br/><br/>Although it was touched upon (visually) briefly....Hookers. Problem solved.<br/><br/>It wasn't even scary, it was a best a very little bit creepy. <br/><br/>With all the wonderful reviews about how it's 'going to change the horror industry' and 'it was a masterpiece' I am HIGHLY disappointed in this movie. I remember begging everyone I could find to go see this movie with me when it was in theaters, I'm really glad I didn't waste my money."
"kenbishton","4","23","91","4 March 2015"," Instant classic? It doesn't follow!
","It's possibly of some significance that many of the less enthusiastic reviews of this film are from the United Kingdom. I wonder if this says something about the different expectations of audiences here in Britain, or maybe the promotion has simply been over-hyped (yet again). <br/><br/>Now, bear with me. I'd more or less given up on the horror genre despite it being my favourite. As a collector, my shelves groan under the weight of all those classic horror films from the silent era, the Universal golden age, Hammer and, yes, John Carpenter (whose influence weighs so heavily on ""It Follows"".) I coped with Jason (but not Freddy), and grimaced at Romero's zombies and all the other nasty things that have crawled on to our screens over the last 90 years or so.<br/><br/>But contemporary horror? It just doesn't do it for me. I hate terms like ""torture porn"" as much as I hate the use of CGI, but sadly, with the likes of Rob Zombie and Eli Roth in the directors' chairs, this is all we seem to get. So when I heard Mark Kermode giving this film a qualified thumbs-up and listened to the hard-to-please critics on Radio Four's Saturday Review wetting their collective knickers over it, I thought I'd give the genre one more try. And I really tried to like it. Honestly, I went with every intention of rediscovering those chills and frissons that drew me to the genre in the first place.<br/><br/>So what did I get? (Possible spoilers follow!)<br/><br/>i) A plot with no rationale. (How did this 'curse' get started? How come no one had heard of it before Greg sleeps with Jay? At least with Michael Myers there's a back story to 'explain' the evil.) <br/><br/>ii) Unlikeable characters - Jay has all the charisma of a cold pizza. They sit around like Generation X bored teenagers from a Larry Clark film (Mark Kermode's point - and I agree). Why any of them would want to have sex with any of the others is hard to believe. Zero personality, zero appeal. <br/><br/>iii) Music that never stops - and I mean never stops. Sub-Carpenter motifs played louder and louder when a few more quiet moments may have helped the suspense. <br/><br/>iv) A dark and gloomy look that seemed too much the result of filters and made me think that the projector bulb was coming to the end its lamp-life! (Yes, I know horror movies often look dark, but NOT dreary.) <br/><br/>v) Scary images that just weren't scary. No spoiler intended, but being threatened by someone urinating as they walked simply made the audience I was with giggle with embarrassment. Unless this was a reference to Regan peeing in ""The Exorcist"" I simply couldn't see why it was included. <br/><br/>vi) Inconsistent inner logic: one of the few effective scenes was when only Jay could see the threat at the swimming pool and we, the audience, couldn't as we were sharing her friends' POV, so how come in other scenes, WE could see the threat approaching when Jay herself wasn't looking and was unaware! Sorry, fellas, this wasn't thought through fully.<br/><br/>So, no, this is NOT the great modern horror classic which others claim (although it will undoubtedly turn into a franchise culminating, after 16 sequels, with ""It Follows: The Musical""). Equally, it is NOT an utter waste of time. The actors do well enough (although Maika Monroe mumbles a lot and I often couldn't tell what she was saying) and the direction is solid if not particularly inventive. But the concept is thin, the suspension of disbelief hard to achieve, and the overall effect underwhelming in the extreme. A fair effort, but one hopes for better. So here's to the next attempt, guys. One day..."
"cluvwrku","2","24","96","7 May 2015"," One of the Lamest movies of all time!
","I despised this movie so much I had to create an account just to warn others. The IMDb reviews for this movie are misleading and for true horror fans this movie is a complete waste of time. It starts out pretty interesting with a great gory opening scene and just enough information to draw you in. Then it keeps you lingering throughout the entire movie while some scenes leave you guessing to what really happened as they insinuate certain things but never really solidify what really took place. Towards the end, the movie falls flat in delivering a climax and conclusion. I give this movie 2 stars for tricking me into thinking that the ending would tie it all together (which it didn't). You've been warned."
"Yuhao88","8","6","17","11 October 2015"," Perfect? No. Daring and creepy? Yes.
","This is one of those movies that's generated so many polarized opinions that it's hard to sift through them all. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor: stop scrolling through reviews right now and go watch it. ""It Follows"" isn't perfect, and some people might find it genuinely ridiculous, but it's original enough to deserve being viewed with fresh eyes and an open mind.<br/><br/>What hooked me was the essentially nightmarish quality of the premise: an inexplicable ""thing"" following you, relentlessly, no matter what. You can run, as they say, but you can't hide. ""It"" often takes forms that are (seemingly) non-threatening yet incongruous: a hospital-gowned old woman in a school hallway, for instance. By its very premise, this movie builds an atmosphere of dread that I've never felt before. The first time a character makes note of a ""person"" that he quickly discovers no one else can see was almost unbearably tense.<br/><br/>However, the monster in ""It Follows"" does fall into the trap that all such heavily rule-based creatures fall into: you'll spend most of the movie thinking of creative ways to beat it. This is especially so in the second half, where all the characters are trying to plan out exactly that. It also starts getting weighed down a bit by the sexual drama, some of which is a little groan-worthy (case in point: the boy who seems completely willing to inherit a death curse if it means he can sleep with his friend). These two negatives might be enough to kill the experience for some - I thought the acting (especially from lead Maika Monroe) was good enough to pull me through when another movie might have lost me completely.<br/><br/>""It Follows"" seems to be a love/hate it kind of movie, and one you'll really need to form your own opinions on. I won't extol it as ""the best thing to happen to horror in years"", but it's a nicely constructed and brave little film worth seeing - if only to find out what everyone's talking about!"
"lucasversantvoort","7","6","17","6 May 2015"," Pretty good, but not a modern masterpiece
","It Follows is one of those films that has excellent word of mouth. You read a recommendation here and there and you suddenly find your interest piqued at the idea of an innovative horror flick, especially these days when you can't swing a dead cat without bumping into Paranormal Activity 7 or Saw 12. I rarely watch horror flicks, but this one had me intrigued, so I went.<br/><br/>Every horror show has a gimmick. The one here is that there's something that follows youngsters who have sex. For people who are complaining that the concept makes no sense, may I remind you're sitting in a theater watching a horror film? As with many a horror film, the film opens with The First Victim, fleeing in terror from something only she can see. As she sits on the beach, there's an impressive shot of what she thinks she sees. We look in the distance, but we can't make anything out. It's a shot that in retrospect reminds of me Antonioni's Blow Up with the photographs. We try to make something out, but we can't. We think we see something, a shape, but we don't. We cut to the main character, Jay, who's preparing to go on a date with a cute guy. She meets him, they have sex, and like a true gentleman he knocks her out afterwards and she wakes up strapped in a wheelchair. We haven't known Jay for very long, but I don't think it's a stretch when I say this isn't what's she's into. He tells her he's not going to hurt her and that there's this thing which will follow her. It changes shape every time, depending on who it preys on. It used to follow him and now he's passed it onto her. Naturally, she doesn't believe him, but when she's sitting in class, looks out the window and sees an old woman wobbling toward her, she flees and together with her surprisingly helpful group of friends she tries to get rid of her pursuer.<br/><br/>I really like the fact the filmmakers realized that scary things can happen in daytime as well. When every horror film from here to Tokyo seems to take place in a world stuck in perpetual nighttime, that's a breath of fresh air. The fact that 'it' only walks towards it victims lends the film a lot of extra creepiness. Consider the scene where the old lady walks towards Jay in the school. It's filmed in broad daylight, there's zero jump scares and yet it's probably the scariest scene in the film. These are the things that make the film feel fresh.<br/><br/>However, I wouldn't go so far as to proclaim It Follows to be a modern horror masterpiece. It adheres to too many clichés for that. Consider the film's reputation. I went to see it, because I got the impression it was not just any old horror flick. What does it mean when a film isn't just a horror film? That it breaks new ground, avoids genre clichés and so on. So, when you find out that it adheres to quite a few of them, it's automatically doubly disappointing. You're impressed by the film's setup and some of the frightening scenes and then the characters start to behave like too typical a horror film character. For instance, why would anyone slowly walk towards the place the killer was last seen? You've got the group hiding in a beach shed while the 'thing' is banging on the door from the outside. He blasts a hole through the bottom part of the door and thennothing. Out of nowhere, Jay has the bright idea of slowly crawling towards the hole to investigate. Why would you even entertain the notion that that's anything remotely close to a good idea? It's just making the characters look stupid for the sake of a jump scare and that's what's annoying; not the scares themselves, but the fact that the characters have to behave stupid for the filmmakers to employ them.<br/><br/>Also, there's some consistency issues regarding the thing that follows. Now, I'm not usually a stickler for such details, much less in horror, but the film lays the groundwork so clearly that you can't help but notice. The rule is that the thing follows you at walking speed; it's always walking towards you no matter where you are and it has zero facial expressions. But then there're times when we see the thing just standing around, walking at different speeds or making a scary face. It may not seem that big a deal, but it's the rules the film is based on. You'll automatically try to think with the characters, trying to figure out the best course of action, but when the thing 'breaks' the rules or introduces new ones, you kind of feel cheated. At least be consistent in this regard.<br/><br/>Other than that, though, It Follows is worth watching. It's not just good horror, but it also plays with a lot of conventions often seen in horror like sexuality. For instance, the world these characters inhabit is jam-packed with couples and thus potential victims. Everywhere you look, it's people in groups of two. Also, everyone (especially Jay's nerdy friend, Paul) wants to get laid. And of course, the fact that you get chased and killed by having sex is an obvious reference to all those nineties horror flicks that had horny groups of youngsters and one psycho killer. If two of them had sex, they'd end up dead for sure. I also love how everyone talks about their parents, yet they're nowhere in sight. All that aside, though, if you're glancing at modern horror and thinking to yourself, 'man, can I have just one decent horror film, please!?', then It Follows is the answer to your prayers."
"xbox-38568","3","9","29","15 July 2015"," Poor horror-movie which lacks in Horror
","All in all poor movie which misses the one thing that a horror movie should have: Horror. It is just not enough to present a cast of strange people with mediocre makeup who follow a girl or a boy in order to kill him or her in an unknown way. A lot of logic flaws, throwing electrical equipment in a pool will never work to kill anyone and last but not least, bullets do not kill under water. Aside from the poor movie, the sinister touch of the pictures in combination with the awesome music of disasterpiece really thrills.

While the basic concept of something or someone non-human following and/or threatening you sounds like a great horror formula, there really is no story line here. They never did anything with it.<br/><br/>The pace is painfully slow. Lots of long, unnecessary shots showing them traveling. A lot of ""creepy music"" scenes where the scenes weren't creepy. A lot of actions and behaviors by characters that are devoid of logic and there are a million loose ends beginning to end.<br/><br/>The viewer walks away from this with a head full of unanswered questions.

","For weeks I danced around whether I should check this film out. The reviews held pretty high here and the reviews were equally consistent though I didn't read too many just so that I didn't spoil the film. <br/><br/>If you are looking for a new twist on classic horror, this is such a true treat. Rich with tropes, hidden understanding and a hyper-reality that the audience can touch in a classic way. <br/><br/>Essentially, ""It"" is as ambiguous as the time frame the film is set. Yet another pinpoint light right on the total subject: age, adulthood, coming of age, as time goes by as seen with the fact that you cannot tell if this film is set in the 70s, 80s, or almost a future way with the clamshell compact eReader as well as the slow walking like a tick, tick, tick, tick of a clock that subtlety references time marches and eventually ""It"" will catch up with you.<br/><br/>Some of the many layers of the film would suggest that ""It"" is adulthood. Although it some have compared this film as Nightmare on Elm Street meets the Ring but really no, It Follows is definitely deeper. This film is as deep as you want it to be and even deeper still with multiple layers. <br/><br/>Completely original, unique and has its own very recognizable queue including the score. The film opens with a long pan 360 shot and continues to provide this type of shot throughout the film. Rich photography and cinematic shots. It gives you a doll house, watcher and being watched. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film, watch it now. If you like horror films, you will not be disappointed."
"CowherPowerForever","2","32","140","6 April 2015"," Sexually Transmitted Ghost
","It Follows is a low budget horror movie that has been getting major attention recently. Not just because of its impressive box office numbers in limited release, but also because some claim it is actually a great horror film. Originality does not necessarily mean quality. This film is a prime example of that. The story rambles on and is meaningless. The film is a giant waste of time, and more importantly, a waste of money. The following is my review of It Follows.<br/><br/>The film was written and directed by David Robert Mitchell. This is his first major film. The story is pretty straight forward. A ghost haunts people who are given this being. The ghost is passed from one person to the next through the act of sexual intercourse. The story happens upon a young girl who gets this ghostly being after having sex with this guy she has been dating a few times. She then starts to freak out and starts seeing people that others do not. While the idea is good, the story overall doesn't explain much past the general outline of the film. The characters are weak and even more stupid than we expect in a horror film. Mitchell gets credit for being original, but outside of that originality, he brings us another really bad film that indie fans love to eat up. If he decides to stick to this genre for future films, I will give him another chance. I just hope it is better than this awful film.<br/><br/>As for the directing side of things, this is one of the brighter spots. The film looks really nice for being filmed on a small budget of two million dollars. Doesn't look cheap like you would see on a sci-fi channel film. Outside of this though, don't expect anything good from the film. The acting is of course downright awful. This is not an area I will attack the film on because horror movies generally have awful acting. The film is generally silly and would be a good film to poke fun at with a group of friends. If this was the goal of David Robert Mitchell, he succeeded big time. From his stupid story that explains nothing and only takes up your valuable time, to the random scenes in the film that make no sense at all, his efforts in both writing and directing aren't anything even average. The film simply looks good, that is clearly not enough to give him credit on, or enough to save this bad film.<br/><br/>The IMDb page for this film does not even mention a composer for the film. After some light digging, I was able to find out Rich Vreeland is the composer. He goes by the name of Disasterpeace for his music. Fitting, because the score for the film was indeed a disaster. The score as overly bombastic and very meaningless most of the time. I love scores, and really love scores for horror movies. At times you will find a hint of Halloween, and at other times Knight Rider. The composer was all over the place for this film. It adds nothing good to the film, and only hurts it. I won't trash all of the work Vreeland has done in his career, but in this case his work was simply awful.<br/><br/>In closing, the film was overly hyped because of its originality and because indie fans love eating garbage up like this. The honest truth is that this film is bad. It certainly isn't worth any price your local theater could be charging to see it. As I mention above, this might be a good film to watch with some friends as you can trash it and make some good jokes at its expense. Outside of that, this film is a clear pass for even the biggest horror fans.<br/><br/>2/10"

","I wanted to see this movie because of the previews and what was said about the film in those advertisements. As in the past, I was very disappointed after watching the movie.

I had a hard time staying awake while watching this movie. I'm glad I did not waste money going to a theater.Good horror films are rare these days and this movie was not one of them.

John Carpenter-esque retro electronic music and subsonic rumbles create an atmosphere of dread.<br/><br/>This movie is by turns dreamy and terrifying.

"Rendanlovell","7","5","14","25 April 2015"," Good but Over-hyped.
","Never has a film pushed abstinence more then 'It Follows'. I know this sounds weird. Even more so when it's a horror film we are talking about. While the film is memorable is countless other ways, this is what I personally got out of 'It Follows'. I am hard pressed to recall a horror film pushing a subject so hard. In every action it takes we are pushed more and more into thinking, ""Don't do the diddly, that will solve all your problems."" It's an interesting combination that doesn't always work. <br/><br/>The mix of horror and preachyness is often times very odd. The only times it doesn't work is when we see ""IT"". The mysterious being that, simply, follows our lead character(s). More times than not ""IT"" is a half (or fully) naked woman. This choice does stay in tune with it's major goal but often comes across more comical than horrifying. The times when one will push themselves against the back of their respective seat is countless. Yet, a number of these times were dampened by weird and sometimes unintentionally funny moments. <br/><br/>This is a big issue for me regardless of how terrifying this film is. And it is terrifying. It will wiggle its way to your very center and stay there. There is quite a bit of down time between each tense scene however. But 'It Follows' isn't dumb enough to just plain give you a break. Even in scenes were nothing happens, fear lingers in the air. It places ""IT"" in the back ground of shots multiple times. Moving ever so slowly towards its prey.<br/><br/>The film cleverly dodges character development, especially with all its down time. It doesn't really give you a moment to think about it's characters. You are as set on getting rid of this horror as it's characters are. This works incredibly well for this film. It gives its characters just enough personality to care about them and feel intensely threatened by ""IT"". <br/><br/>""It Follows' soundtrack is also something I should mention. It has an 80's arcade feel surrounding it. It's odd yet it does a fantastic job of bringing the film to life without sounding like the stereotypical horror score. It's as exacting as the film it plays over top. Even if some of the plot decisions falter from time to time."

When it got going there was some good elements if not a bit weird in places. But overall I felt it was lacking a few things, a good script, good actors and an ending. I felt that in some places the writer didn't think about what was happening as I found myself shouting at the screen what they should do as it would be common sense if it was happening to someone in real life, this gave the film a unrealistic feel. The weird parts was not just weird it was WEIRD and I have seen many strange horror films before. My recommendation is to randomly pick any other film its bound to be better."

"HowItWorked","9","5","15","6 August 2015"," With so many boring horror films out there, It Follows is a real treat
","If it has weak moments, it's after the pool scene. Although, those scenes do give it some more depth, things to think about. That's the great thing about this film's writing. It's just so logical. It's so common in horror, especially horror as creative as this, to have a lot of characters making stupid decisions or leaving the audience to wonder what the hell is going on or why it's happening. That's not the case with It Follows.<br/><br/>This movie works on different levels. On a completely real world level, this well- directed, very well cast (as in, the characters look real, they're not celebrities), well- written, and well-shot movie, it is totally plausible and scarier for the fact that it plays so well with the thriller trope of somebody in distress, terrified by something others don't see, believe, or understand (Orphan, The Good Son, many horror movies where the parents don't believe the kids). It also works on another level. This could all be inside the people's heads. Sure, that theory is kind of debunked with chairs being thrown. But, when it bleeds, only the effected one can see it. That's another thing. Can the last person that effected one had sex with also see it? It's brought to our attention when Jeff, formerly known as Hugh, is afraid that he sees it, a girl who turns out to be just a stranger walking by. That's part of the great tension in this movie too. It could really be anybody. This movie has stripped bare some of the greatest elements of horror and made them even scarier. There's even less comfort in having your friends there to protect you now. You may be safe now, miles away, but it's still walking, and it'll make it to wherever you are by nighttime.<br/><br/>This movie has a great soundtrack with detuned attacking tones that almost give the film a 70s horror vibe while still staying fresh and creepy. Possible homages to other horror classics that this film brings to mind itself: The Exorcist, with a certain something dripping down the leg of one ""girl"". The other is Halloween with almost everything on TV that the main characters watch being some retro horror film, although that could be a coincidence.<br/><br/>It's surprising. You get crazy visuals like a zombie-like girl dripping with her own urine, a very broken leg, some very intense incest(?), but it never feels like it's there to shock you or make you scream. This film isn't cheap. It has some jump scares but none of them are really ""false"" in the sense that what's revealed after the scream isn't scary. It's that you don't see anything that's scary. If Bruce the Shark takes a bite out of your boat, which do you think is scarier to find next when you look out at the sea? A great big shark coming toward you? Or waters completely still. The latter is the great strength of great horror movies like Jaws and It Follows, and, from what I hear, The Babadook (which I hope to see very soon). What a great movie this was. It was superbly entertaining."
"mh37434","7","4","11","21 August 2015"," A real horror movie - not just a lame visual spectacle...
","Being a huge fan of sci-fi, fantasy and horror, and all the other subgenres of speculative fiction, I have to say I enjoyed this film very much. It could have been just another silly visual spectacle that seems to be so common with films of this type these days, sci-fi movies are pretty much action movies, and fantasy films are mostly Disney-esque, and of course horror films are pretty much just slasher films only, filled with gore and not really scary at all.<br/><br/>Now I'll have you know first off, that I was by no means terrified by this film, I have seen way too many horror films for really anything to have much of an effect on me. So for me, it's not the fear that's so gripping about good horror movies, it's the excitement and facing the unknown. Yep, this is a supernatural horror film, which to me is what horror is supposed to be. I think horror works best when it uses sci-fi or fantasy elements, such as alien monsters or fantasy creatures such as Ogres. That being said, this was not like the average horror film of this era, this is more of a throwback to the horror films from the good old days. Yeah, it's that good. It's not a slasher film, and really all of the characters in the movie are pretty likable, something not very common in horror movies in a while. It seems like there's always some jerk character that's a jock bully, and you already know he's gonna get killed because he fits that stereotype, you can just assume he'll be the first character that the monster kills.<br/><br/>Thankfully, this film has no such character. Every character in the show is pretty likable. And the music is way cool too. I really don't know if the movie would have done so great if not for the music. It was really cool. I marked this review a spoiler one, and here's why, the monster is a -- well, we don't have a clue what it is. It could be an alien, imp, bogeyman, goblin...the truth is, it's never revealed. But it's drawn to sex, whatever it is, whoever she has sex with gets killed and then it goes after her again. But she's safe as long as she keeps passing it on, by having sex.<br/><br/>The creature is invisible, except to those who it's after or has been after. In fact, it can have a variety of appearances. Yeah, it seems to be a shapeshifter. In fact, it once shapeshifts as this dude's mom and then rapes him. So the last thing he sees before he dies is mom raping him. Yeah, that scene gets an A+ for its' disturbing shock value. Anyway the monster...well...it keeps coming, it...follows. And yes, that's why the movie's called that. But don't judge the movie by its' somewhat silly title. I honestly remember I laughed last year when I first saw the trailer for it, I figured it was just gonna be another stupid lame teenager horror film. And yes, the characters are teenagers mostly but that's beside the point. It's a great film, I watched the DVD just yesterday and I think if you like traditional horror films, you'll like this."

","I have never written a review on here before and this movie drove me to write one.

I honestly don't even know how people thought this movie was scary. Were all these reviews written by 5 year olds or something? I have a really open mind when it comes to movies and I tried to get into this but it just wasn't happening. I would recommend a pass on this one.

"nielivarez","5","2","4","17 April 2020"," It follows ... an interesting start into the mediocrity.
","'It follows' is an OK horror movie.<br/><br/>The starting scene is brilliant and establishes that it's not another typical cheap jump-scare movie. But as the acts follow, it falls into a slump of repeating what you have already seen in lesser movies.<br/><br/>Characters choose to do away with any semblance of logic and the ending, at least on the surface, is very uncharacteristic of the premise.
However, there is one scary scene in particular which is ingeniously directed and will remain in my mind as the highlight of the movie. But other than that I wasn't scared almost at all during the entirety of the movie, even though I am not hard to scare; unless I was expected to be terrified by characters watching random people through different windows.<br/><br/>On a higher level, the plot attempts to deliver some metaphors which communicate specific moral values and also there are a few not-so-obvious twists that you can miss if you aren't paying attention. Which all are left (presumably artistically) open for interpretation.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is somewhere in between. Its flaws somewhat mask its genius moments, but hose moments are there regardless. In the end, you end up with a good movie, which in my less than humble opinion, is far from a masterpiece. And to be honest, I am surprised by other reviews which most reside at far ends of the spectrum.<br/><br/>Personal suggestion: Watch it, if you have no better horror movies at hand."

"gewizardhire","4","2","4","26 September 2019"," Lots of effort, ultimately fails.
","*Minor* spoilers in the review.<br/><br/>It's difficult to organize my thoughts on this movie, and speak to the extreme reviews (seems like people are either ranking it 'amazing' or 'trash', and its neither).<br/><br/>There is well done suspense and 'scary' moments to the movie; a lot of care was put into this, which I appreciated.<br/><br/>The movie is very 'ambient', and well done in that regard (some reviews are calling this aspect 'slow' or 'bored me to tears', but its purposeful and well done in this regard, in my opinion).<br/><br/>Why am I giving it a 4/10; the movie manages to make virtually every single possible 'horror movie failure' possible. The main character is told exactly how the evil thing works, and even after accepting that its real continues to ignore what she and the audience know about it. She knowingly follows it sometimes, why? There is literally no point other than allowing the audience to 'see' it in action, but that could be done on camera without her present. She manages to harm it at one point, but then gives up on trying to kill it for no reason. It has to interact with the physical world, its not some magical thing that just *pops* up wherever it pleases, so she could try and get 'official' help (police, etc) but never attempts to. Soundtrack and a lot of the scenery and surroundings make it seem like its set in the 80s but there are modern cars and electronic devices. I found myself constantly wondering where we were and what year it was. You know the movie isn't 'doing it right' when you *constantly* are yelling 'WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT?!' or 'DON'T GO IN THERE' at the screen. And these aren't cases where the audience is privy to information the characters on screen are not; they have experienced *exactly* the same thing as the audience, no 'reveals' to just the audience.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this, as it is different than a lot of horror movies, but ultimately it was a massive disappointment due to the numerous and obvious flaws and falls prey to virtually all horror movie tropes (not in a good way).<br/><br/>Oddly enough, I do recommend watching it, but if you're looking for a movie to fully engage you and give you a REAL scare, this is sadly not the one.<br/><br/>Edit: After reading ALLLLL of the reviews currently on IMDB about this film I felt like I had to add something in response to what I'm seeing in my own review.<br/><br/>Probably unsurprisingly, most reviews are 'polar' (either 1 star or 9or10 stars). The 1 star reviews are mostly complaining that its boring and that the 'thing' in the movie is never explained as to what it is, and that something slowly walking at you isn't scary. To these people I say that they aren't horror fans, they're not looking for an actual *scare*, they probably want a slasher or something along those lines. For something to be scary you don't need an explanation as to what it is, in fact, in general that makes it all that much more scary.<br/><br/>The other side, the 9 and 10 star reviews praising the film for how amazing it is. Do I get the 'hype' in that regard of it being 'refreshing' and not the same crap that every other horror movie is? Absolutely!!!! But these people must be blind as there are *sooooooo* many plot and logic issue with this film, which are specifically the reason I'm giving it a low rating. If somehow magically the film didn't have massive plot issues (which I haven't touched on even half of them in this review, trying to leave something for people that want to give it a chance) I would easily give this a 10/10.<br/><br/>I wish people would be honest with themselves and in these reviews, not just blasting immediately to a 1 or a 10. That's not a review. That's ignorantly trying to force people to like or dislike something because you personally love or hate it."

"thelastblogontheleft","8","2","4","29 January 2017"," Minimalist Horror
","I know I'm far from alone in this, but I LOVED this movie. It debuted at Cannes in 2014 and when it had its worldwide release in 2015 it grossed over $20 million. The writer and director, David Robert Mitchell, developed the movie and was inspired in part by recurring dreams he had in his youth about being followed. Aesthetically, Mitchell and director of photography, Mike Gioulakis, were inspired by the ""surreal suburban imagery"" of American photographer Gregory Crewdson. It is absolutely minimalist horror at its finest.<br/><br/>The story primarily follows Jay (Maika Monroe) as well as her sister, Kelly (Lili Sepe), her childhood friend, Paul (Keir Gilchrist, a favorite of mine), her friend Yara (Olivia Luccardi), and their neighbor, Greg (Daniel Zovatto). Jay has a frightening experience while on a date with Hugh (Jake Weary) wherein they sleep together and then he knocks her out with chloroform and she awakens and is informed that he has passed along some kind of mysterious, pursuing, murderous entity onto her a curse of sorts. She is shaken but skeptical at first, until she starts to see evidence that he is right after all, and her and her friends try to figure out what ""it"" is and how to stop it.<br/><br/>Where do begin to count the all the ways that I love this movie? Firstly, the music is great. Honesty, I often don't notice the music in many movies — not that the music is bad, per se, but I find that it's sadly rare when the music truly FITS the mood of a film. Rich Vreeland, also known as Disasterpeace, scored It Follows and I think he succeeded in coming up with a soundtrack that is sufficiently sinister and foreboding. It helps to add to the claustrophobia of the entire film, the sick, slow dread.<br/><br/>They did an amazing job at creating a general sense of unease in the film. Between the settings, the weird combination of technology (Yara uses that awesome clamshell phone/e-reader, and yet only corded phones abound around them, for example), the wardrobe, and even the perceived temperature, you are never fully able to figure out WHAT is going on, and it throws you into this very subtle sense of confusion.<br/><br/>The adults in the movie are very intentionally kept out of focus — sometimes literally. It is meant to only focus on the teenagers and their mission, and I think in a way it adds to that sort of surreal atmosphere.<br/><br/>There are a few camera shots that stood out, but the main one for me was the wild 720-degree shot in the school hallway, panning right by one of the lurching creatures on its way around. Brilliant.<br/><br/>The whole thing has a very Stranger Things vibe, particularly because of the friends' willingness to help Jay — they are just unwavering in their support and belief — and then solidified when the whole thing ends at the pool. Though I much prefer the atmosphere (and music!) of Stranger Things — basically what I'm saying is if you enjoyed this movie, go check out that show NOW. Funny, too, that Disasterpeace was actually asked to do the music for Stranger Things but he turned it down, citing a desire to not be too pigeonholed in the 80's-inspired genre.<br/><br/>It is minimalist horror in the sense that we only actually see the full capabilities of ""it"" a handful of times throughout the movie (though when we do, it is super effective). It doesn't focus on gore or even shock effects or jump scares. It's just this slow burning, creeping dread this feeling of not being able to escape no matter how hard you try. The ""monster"" in this movie is vague, undefined, and shifting, which I think gives it a lot of power. It's not disgusting and deformed, it doesn't have a disturbing back story, it isn't cocky and taunting it just IS. As Mitchell himself has said, ""There's no logic to it—you can't really explain a nightmare.""<br/><br/>And then we have the ending, which is surprisingly romantic and intimate. Paul is willing to do anything for Jay — to even risk his own life in a pursuit to save hers — and it's beautiful in a sad way.<br/><br/>Intelligent, daring, and thought-provoking and it's on Netflix, so you've got no excuse. Go!"
"tiskec","1","2","4","24 October 2016"," ""It Follows"" - Right to the Trash Can
","** THIS REVIEW COULD CONTAIN MASSIVE SPOILERS. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE MOVIE SPOILED, I WOULD SUGGEST VIEWING THE FILM BEFORE READING THIS REVIEW. **<br/><br/>OK, I want to start this review with a straight up opinionated statement, which is ""pure garbage"". I did not connect with any of the characters at all. The feeling just wasn't there. The way the chic acted when the ""entity"" appears, were just not genuinely convincing moments. Her fear or action just weren't sincere at all. I did not see eye to eye with the acting at all. The fear wasn't at all convincing, especially coming from teenagers, who naturally overact to everything. <br/><br/>Another problem I had with this movie was the fact that I believe that a portion of this script stemmed from the movie ""TEETH."" It's not the same concept, with the main character in Teeth having teeth in her vagina, but the sexual entity aspect of both. It's the same thing. A young girl is effected and has to sleep with the right person in the end. The only difference is there's a ghost or possession following the girl in ""It Follows,"" and Teeth always apart of a girl in ""Teeth."" Both movies have to do with sex, kind of with the same ambition to get rid of what's happening to them. The plots are heavily related, with the main issue of the problem being treated like some kind of STD. So, they're the same but they're not. However, ""It Follows"" still reminds me of the movie ""Teeth,"" therefore I give no props for originality. <br/><br/>Finally, the ending was very unclear as well. After the girl's friend had sex with her, did he get rid of the ""possession"" afterwords, or not? It was probably what I would've done (sleep with a prostitute) if he did what I expected he did at the end. I couldn't blame him. It's very sick to think about, and to even say you'd do, but this is what this movie makes you think at the end, giving the situation. That's also part of the reason I did not ""feel"" the ending in this film. <br/><br/>To sum everything up, the movie had bad acting, an eye-roller of a story, and was unable to grasp my one-hundred percent attention. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
"rvillarreal-08019","9","2","4","5 September 2016"," Unique Horror Film
","Contains Spoilers<br/><br/>I know this movie seems to have a lot of bad reviews, but honestly, I loved this movie from start to finish. I watched it twice just so I could get the full understanding of it and I think that's what throws a lot of people is that they don't understand, so it seems stupid. Even watching it a second time I didn't feel like I was having ""PRACTICE ABSTINENCE"" shoved down my throat. I loved Jay's character and I found her fear very believable. <br/><br/>I found the movie thrilling and suspenseful! There were some parts of the movie were I found Jay doing stupid things, running up stairs after the kitchen break-in, Jay taking off without her friends at the lake, and staying in the pool when The It is throwing electronics (GET OUT)!!! Good points though, Jay's family/friends standing behind her to support this craziness she is going through rather than Jay trying to go about what had happened to her all alone. I LOVE the film score (like old school 80's movie style), and I really like how it's kind of difficult to tell when the movie is taking place! Some things are modern (clothing, shell device - even though it's not real - similar to smart phone, cars, how the characters talk), but then the houses looks older, almost 70/80's style (phone, TV, furniture, etc). I just found the movie interesting because it does not fit the typical horror movie mold (PREDICTABLE, lots of blood, gore, EVERYONE being killed, too many dumb damsel in distress moments, profanity ever other line, not much room for imagination, etc) - it's just..different.<br/><br/>I like that there are no real set rules and it just goes off the experiences of those affected by The It - so it leaves some things up for interpretation. Where did The It come from and why? I like that there is some mystery! It makes you think! I feel like horror movies are so predictable now, not to say It Follows did not have some predictable moments, but as I said before...it was just different and that's what I enjoyed most. However, I can understand how this movie is not for all, but if you like different and aren't too critical - give It Follows a try..."

It looks great(other than the monotonous panning), and the story-line is definitely interesting and fresh.

","Certain horror movies (mainly those rated PG-13) contain a formula of mirror-misdirection, cat-jumps and a story that has no logical beginning or logical ending. This was one of those (even with the R rating).<br/><br/>I was originally attracted to this because of the high Metascore, but maybe it was rated by critics under the age of 30 or who are parents of small children.<br/><br/>There were parts of this (especially at the beginning), where the movie showed a tremendous amount of promise. I was still expecting a good explanation for the situation to have come about, but that satisfaction never arrived.<br/><br/>I was expecting the characters to ""get wise"" at some point, but that never happened. Maybe it was sleep deprivation.<br/><br/>If the characters had figured out a ""speed-of-travel"" of the entity and then had calculated how far the new victim should go to get x-amount of sleep, it would have taken a more logical turn. Instead, it just had them run random distances at random times. The formula was broken when certain aspects of the entity could be seen by different people, but they couldn't really help. They were just there to show different forms of fright.<br/><br/>It also seems that people who do a good amount of ""hooking-up"" should have been in the hierarchy all around town to see the thing moving. What would happen if two people hooked-up twice? What about an orgy? What about a new level of indirection where a female thinks it's after her, but it passes her and gets the male next to her because of a secret hook-up with her previous male hook-up? Maybe the sequel will give a better explanation."

Somehow it reminds me of some old film adapted from the Stephen King's novels, or movies who slowly burn like ""The Others"" but without surprising twist. You will not find here many usual volume pumped frighting scenes, unlike it is all about a subtle terror centered in a single and great very scary horror idea.<br/><br/>If you expect to jump on the seat or to see lot of blood this is not for you.

It doesn't answer any questions about the curse and ends in an all too easy open end.<br/><br/>Otherwise this is a well constructed, atmospheric and unique horror movie with a great soundtrack.

Among those is her recovery after the swimming pool scene...I've neven seen such a moment like this played better. And, of course, as her friends have it, she is disgustingly pretty. Part of that is a shapely upper lip. In the end of the movie, she chooses for her mate a small, nebbishy Jewish guy...instead of one of the big, hunky Gentiles around.

No, It's because they think that the demons represent STD and the movie would spread awareness against it( Lmao...but to me,STDs seems to be sexually transmitted demons.xD)<br/><br/>So, the movie is about a demon whose curse is transferred from one person to other while sexual intercourse.

After the mark is passed to someone, the killer starts to tirelessly stalk them. It's slow but smart, which feels like a play on so many horror villains of old that would only ever walk menacingly yet still catch their fleeing victims.<br/><br/>Production-wise, this seems like it was made relatively cheaply. There's not really any special effects here but that's not to say there aren't effective shots. Given the premise, they don't really need any crazy CGI or a mass of Bay-esque explosions.<br/><br/>The acting felt middling to poor, but honestly that's most horror movies to me. Also standard in horror movies, I feel like our main people are pretty stupid at times and if they'd actually thought about things, the killer is probably fairly easy to deal with.<br/><br/>Again, the concept for this is interesting and new to me, and I always value new ideas. It's shot well. It's not acted terribly and is on par for the genre. By the end of the movie though when I was asked what I thought my instant reaction was a shrug followed by ""Its alright."" It just didn't grab me how I wanted it to."

","If you like Hereditary i think you will like it too. The movie is in the forefront with its mystery theme. Main theme behind the horror is the development of plots, plot twists, so many riddles, puzzles and the theories after the end. Because the movie is not ended as like a crystal clear.<br/><br/>The usage of different time situations but not inconspicuously and other details that is helpful to solve the riddles are really put remarkably. 9/10"
"lvakq","6","0","0","29 November 2019"," Started off so well, why ruin it
","The first half of the film is really, very effective. Superbly crafted, from the refreshing idea, to the filming, to the music. Goddam that tall man scene is one of the most frightening things I've ever seen in a film. I am giving this a 6/10 for those reasons.<br/><br/>What worked so well is that it was very psychological, until a certain point -- the monster is only visible to the infected person, and thus to everyone else, it is like it's in their head. The infected person is totally trapped.<br/><br/>... and then they ruin that on the beach scene, which for me watered down all the remaining scare factor to pretty much zero. They made the monster 'physical'. It's there and capable of doing anything a regular person can except it's got a magic invisibility cloak on it for everyone else. This takes a psychological fear into a 'scary killer monster' fear. Now the protagonist is no longer alone, they can (with some level of coordination) get help. And moreover, the monster is no longer invincible, because they can physically be pushed away/delayed from getting to the main character. It's automatically less scary. Such a shame."
"jacobywarner","8","0","0","26 November 2019"," Utterly Horrifying
","This film is one of the scariest films that I have ever seen, feeding on the primal fear of the unknown. A predator whose soul purpose is to hunt down their prey, no need for food or sleep just the relentless pursuit. This brings on a fear that everyone knows, the sense of someone or something rather following you causing you to constantly look over your shoulder. This along side the fact that you never know what you are looking for adds a whole other level of paranoia.<br/><br/>That being said I give this film an 8/10 because the days following my viewing I found myself constantly looking over my own shoulder thinking about the endless pursuit."

","It Follows is one of my go-to horror movies that I never get tired of. It's not very scary but is creepy and suspenseful. From the very first scene you know there is something to be afraid of and I love how it kicks off the dread for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>While ""It"" is passed along via sex, the movie never feels raunchy or gratuitous. Maika Monroe acts legitimately terrified which is probably what prevents this movie from ever seeming stupid. That's not to say there aren't a few disappointments. The last 20 or 30 minutes are a bit lackluster but I still enjoy the film as a whole.<br/><br/>The direction, cinematography, and score of It Follows are superb; the 360 shots are used brilliantly to make you feel like danger can come from anywhere, and the music fits each scene so well. There's a very surreal undertone, like how in dreams things don't always fit together or make sense. It's a great way of subconsciously throwing you off. I'm a fan of subtle scares, creepy things you may not always notice on the first watch. In the opening scene you hear a screen door screech as a girl runs out, then off screen you hear it two more times, but see only one other person has exited from it. It's the subtle things like that that I personally love in horror movies. If you prefer jump scares or supernatural-looking monsters, this may not be for you. I recommend giving it a chance though."

","While far from perfect, I consider this movie to be one of my favorite horror movies in recent years. Some of the actors could be a little better, but I really like the group of friends in this film and find most of them to be convincing for the most part. The slower scenes in which they are reminiscing about their childhood or just being there for one another are some of my favorite scenes. I think it's best to watch this movie without knowing what this thing is, so I won't go into details. I'll just say that I find this concept to be terrifying. When it comes to the technical aspects of this film, I love the way this film looks. Whether it's day or night time, I love the look. And lastly, the music in this movie is amazing and terrifying. If you love music from 80's horror films, you'll probably love this soundtrack as well. I really only have one issue with the movie and it's one that others have mentioned. The rules regarding this thing the characters are running from are inconsistent. For better or for worse, the rules aren't consistent or explained outside of an early exposition scene. I don't find the final confrontation scene to be bad, but I wouldn't say it's great either. While I'm not completely satisfied with that scene, I do really like the ending to this movie. I do think this film is the most enjoyable on your first viewing when you don't know what's going on.

","It Follows is an interesting low budget independent horror film. It has the decency to have mostly nice likeable young characters.<br/><br/>Jay Height (Maika Monroe) is a pretty teenager who has sex with her new boyfriend. He then ties her up and in a desolate house tells her that he has passed a curse on to her.<br/><br/>Some kind of malevolent entity will now follow her, it can be anyone and it will try to kill her. The only way out for her is to pass the curse along to someone else and hopefully they will transmit it forward.<br/><br/>Jay is troubled, soon she has visions of someone following her. Her friends and family are worried about Jay but rally around her. Yet they cannot see what Jay is seeing.<br/><br/>The film can be seen as an allegory of the consequences of promiscuous sex and passing on sexually transmitted diseases. The premise of passing on a curse can go back to cult films such as Night of the Demon by Jacque Tourneur.<br/><br/>Writer/Director David Robert Mitchell begins the film with a half naked young woman running scared out of her house in heels. Her dead contorted body is found on the beach. Outside of this he has gone for slow burn suspense rather than visceral horror.<br/><br/>The use of electronic music and going for jump scares reminded me of the early movies of John Carpenter."
"ashturner-79373","6","0","0","29 January 2019"," Kind of atmospheric, I guess...
","While the lead performances here are fine, I must say the characters in this film are pretty dull. A couple of them have silly quirks - Jay plays with grass a lot and Yara has an e-reader shaped like a clam - but that's it. The premise of Jay being stalked after inheriting a demon through sexual intercourse is neat though, but the problem is in the execution.<br/><br/>I think this film is boring. It screams teen angst, and it's full of awkward teenager stuff like sitting around cross-legged drinking beer, smoking, and talking about first kisses and running away. 'It' is a clever horror concept with clear rules that also encourages you to watch the backgrounds of scenes, but I don't understand the reasoning behind the forms It takes - why does It look like naked people, or a woman peeing herself? I'm also not sure I understand what the climactic swimming pool scene was all about - what was Paul's plan with the electrical appliances (and why didn't it work?), why does It survive, why do Jay and Paul have sex after, and why does this film have so many swimming pools anyway?<br/><br/>On the plus side, the production is incredibly slick. It's very nicely shot (with some impressive 360° camera shots), and the score is wonderfully eerie and not relied upon too much - very good use is made of silence.<br/><br/>Obviously there are sexual undercurrents to It, which reminds of an STD, but I feel like I'm missing something else. There are a lot of quotations from books that the writer probably thought sounded deep, and water seems to be a recurring motif with numerous scenes at either swimming pools or the coast. I'm not sure what the deal is with that kid that keeps spying on Jay either.<br/><br/>The gorgeous cinematography and score are the only things that make this film worth watching for me. It has its moments, and there is a fairly unsettling atmosphere, but it's also pretty boring watching teenagers talk about sex and their childhoods in between those.<br/><br/>6/10."
"johannes2000-1","8","0","0","8 January 2019"," Very unusual, but intriguing and highly original horror movie.
","This is a very unusual horror-movie. There's no gore, no slashings, no jumps-scares, so it's probably not every horror-fans cup of tea (as the mixed reviews clearly indicate), but I have to say that I was very much intrigued throughout the whole film. Sure, there are some things to say against it: the pace is extremely slow, the dialogues are sparse, there's hardly any action (save an unexpected very chilling action-scene in a swimming-pool in the last 15 minutes), there are in the end no answers or decent solutions to the mystery. I can imagine that some will consider it boring.<br/><br/>But - at least in my opinion - there is much more to say in its favor. It's absolutely original (which is quite an achievement in the nowadays over-saturated horror-market) and the atmosphere is haunting, thanks to the inventive direction, the beautiful photography and a very effective, chilling musical score. The characters - a group of adolescent kids - interrelate more by stoically hanging out together than by words and all behave for most part of the movie as in slow motion, which enhances the weird, dreamlike feeling that this whole project creates. As does the facts that there are never any parents in sight, that the kids constantly watch old scifi movies from the fifties and sixties on television and that one of them - a girl of about 15 - reads The Idiot by Dostojewsky on a pink shell-shaped e-reader and every now and then quotes some lines from it to the rest.<br/><br/>The premise (girl gets ""infected"" by her boyfriend with a supernatural force in the form of weird appearances that follow and threaten her, and from then her friends try to help her to get rid of it) grants for some weird and creepy moments, culminating in the aforementioned climax in a deserted swimming pool. But I got the distinct feeling that there was more to this story than just the horror-aspects, it seemed as if there were many metaphores that I coulnd't quite put my finger on. Something to do with sexually coming of age, I guess, since the sexual ""deed"" played such a pivotal role in the transmitting of the curse and so many of the apparitions had clearly sexual connotations.<br/><br/>The acting is over-all rather restrained, but especially Maika Monroe as the tormented Jay does a great job. And I would also like to mention Keir Gilchrist. His character behaves so subdued and reactive that it doesn't give much room to shine, but he does magic with his body language and his face. I saw him before in Heartthrob where he has a leading part, that movie wasn't great but Gilchrist sure was!<br/><br/>All in all I was very much intrigued and entertained and I rank it 8 out of 10."

While it's a horror film with plenty of creepiness and plenty of jump scares, it also has some great metaphors about sex and STD's (if you choose to read into it, but I'm not sure how you can't).

","It Follows is one of the many examples of modern horror movies that serves as an allegory for a contempory social issue, and at that, it does quite a good job. Where it falls off for me is in the execution of some of the scares and character choices. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot to like about this movie. I particularly was intruiged by the premise of a ""sexually transmitted demon"" as well as how the demon can disguise itself. There are some amazing scenes of tension in which we see a person in the distance slowly approaching the main characters. Also the idea that the demon can disguise itself as anyone and be anywhere is truly terrifying if used in the proper setting such as a crowded area. However, the director/writer opted for the demon to be incredibly conspicuous for almost every scene where it would appear as a creepy old woman or demonic looking child. It seems like the director might have had pressure to make the movie more appealing to the mainstream audience so he had to water down his premise. I also took issue with some of the choices the characters make. We're told that the group of teens are very smart but then see them sit in an open field with their backs exposed to the demon. I personally feel like this was simply lazy writing to set up a scare. This makes it hard to root for the main character because at every turn, she does the least logical option often resulting in her getting nearly attacked by the demon. Overall, this movie is good, but I just think some elements of it could be done better. That being said, it's worth checking out for fans of the genre."

","I rented it for Daniel Zovatto. He's a wonderful actor but holy hell his death was more disturbing than anything I've watched him in. 
The whole movie creeped me out but I can see where people felt like it was preachy or followed the ''have sex get punished"" trope.
Still creepy, paced well, and I like that it makes you ask the ""could you live with yourself"" question.
 I knew when I watched The Ring that I could pass along a copy of a tape to save myself. No question. 
I don't know how anyone wouldn't be 'followed' by passing along the ghost/curse in this film.
That's why I have to give credit to a film that redrew the line of morality vs survival.
TL;DR it's messed up and possibly has a tired old message but I think it did ask for more thought on how much effecting others effects ourselves. 
Zovatto deserves credit for his acting but his last scene is deeply disturbed...go watch him in something else"

","When I first heard about this I thought it was going to be way different then it actually was. I originally expected that the STD demon would be someone just in a crowd or in the form of someone Jay knew. Usually the watcher could tell who the demon was because they were not blending into the crowd and were easily identifiable. Take the grandma in the scene at the school. When else will there be a little old lady at the school in her nightgown. There also was a lot of random shots that really didn't help the movie for example the scene were she was at the lake/beach and saw the boat it shows her getting undressed and walking into the water then it shows her driving the car sopping wet. Also there was no indication that there were any parents involved in the whole movie. Where were Jays parents or any of the other kids. When they were running from the demon they never went far which in my mind is dumb. The demon was slow moving at most times so why not go farther away then where they were going and why go to open places. The last thing I didn't really like was how did the demon not get Jay while she was in the hospital for three days can it not enter the hospital? The movie does keep you wanting to keep watching it but it has a lot of parts that make completely no sense and in my opinion were probably just added to make the movie longer."

","David Robert Mitchell had a brilliant idea outlined for a horror film, one that has been commended for its originality leaving other modern films of the genre two steps behind.<br/><br/>""It Follows"" revolves around a young girl, Jamie, who spends her time with her boyfriend, Hugh. One night after a date, they get intimate in the car, when suddenly Hugh knocks her out unconscious by using chloroform. She wakes up tied to a chair in an abandoned building where Hugh explains to her that she is now cursed and that no matter when or where, a supernatural entity will slowly follow here until it reaches her and consumes her. It is revealed that the curse can be lifted if she has sexual relations with someone else, therefore passing the curse to the other person. From here on, with the help or her friends, Jamie tries to figure out what to do next.
Maika Monroe gave a great performance as Jamie, having the puzzled appearance of a teenager trapped with her own demons.<br/><br/>The idea of an entity following you restlessly until it gets to you is great. The fact that it can appear as anyone at any time, family member or random person on the street, makes it even more scarier. My only concern is that the way it was transmitted, by sexual encounter, and the plot involving teenagers adds up to what's typically a horror movie cliche. Naturally, you will be expected to see a lot of dumb decisions of that nature throughout the film.<br/><br/>The film's pace is slow accompanied by eery music and it loses its focus here and there giving the movie a prolonged and jarring feeling. It definitely has some good moments, like the fact that the audience doesn't know if the person that walks towards the cursed one is a normal human being or the supernatural entity. That right there brings out more scares and excitement than the overused jump scares.<br/><br/>""It Follows"" does not shape up in to a scary film, in a true ""cover your eyes"" way, instead it gives a feeling of petrifying terror about to hit at any moment.

","19-year-old Jay Height (a fine and sympathetic performance by Maika Monroe) has sex with the mysterious Hugh (an effectively antsy portrayal by Jake Weary) in the back seat of his car. Unbeknownst to Jay, Hugh was being relentlessly stalked by a deadly and persistent carnal supernatural force that's now after her.<br/><br/>Writer/director David Robert Mitchell relates the inspired and absorbing story at a hypnotically gradual pace, grounds the fantastic premise in a believably mundane everyday reality, ably crafts a potently unsettling sense of pure flesh-crawling dread and unease, and offers an original otherworldly demon which could very well represent a fatal sexually transmitted disease ala AIDS, the deep-seated fear and inevitability of death, and even the feelings of guilt and shame that the puritanical American culture ascribes to people engaging in intercourse for pleasurable purposes. Moreover, this film's strangely timeless quality adds immensely to its overall eerie and unnerving atmosphere while the fact that the demonic force moves slow, but never gives up and seems unstoppable ensures that this picture is guaranteed to really get under your skin. In addition, there are sturdy supporting contributions from Lili Sepe as Jay's concerned sister Kelly, Daniel Zovatto as the decent Greg Hannigan, Keir Gilchrist as smitten nerd Paul, and Olivia Luccardi as the gawky Yara.

"anonveli","7","0","0","27 September 2017"," Fresh, original concept for a horror movie
","It Follows is an original concept compiled into what can only be explained as an artistic horror film. It was released in 2014 but has gained some traction over the past few years and landed on many ""must watch horror"" lists. The concept is that ""it"" will follow whoever the carrier is, which is passed on through sex to a new carrier. Not the kind of STD that your doctor is going to write you a script of penicillin to clear up. So, buckle up and let's do a spoiler free review of It Follows.<br/><br/>The Good: The first thing you're probably going to ask yourself while watching this movie is what time frame this is set in. The style of clothing could match the modern-day hipster or young adults that are fashion savvy. The settings and most of the technology or lack thereof (other than some weird shell e-reader thing) could also lean towards being late 70s/early 80s. It makes for an interesting approach to the overall atmosphere and according to the director David Robert Mitchell, it's intentionally filmed this way to create a dream effect (AV Club). It's a very cool spin to what is already an interesting concept for a movie.<br/><br/>The build of suspension in this movie is phenomenal. The score is constantly building tension, as Jay (Maika Monroe) is eluding her stalking demon. The beauty of it is that half the time you never actually see the monster and when you do, it often looks very ordinary. Yet the director still manages to build a sense of dread without going in the direction of making it hokey. Like horror of old, the director created a slow, steady and unrelenting monster which will constantly keep you on edge. They could have very easily gone with an over-the- top CGI monster but I'm certainly glad they went with a far subtler approach. This movie will make you think twice about anyone slowly walking in your direction.<br/><br/>This film is also paced very well. It Follows wastes no time in introducing you for what's to come and manages to stay consistent for the entire film. The director manages to make an almost two hour film feel like an hour. Jay and her friends are quick to start coming up with some ideas on how to evade the creature and buy some time to really assess the situation. I love when characters in horror movies play it smart by developing and executing plans that don't suck. Whether they're all successful or not is a totally different story.<br/><br/>The Bad: Now that I went on my whole rant about great plans and execution, I have to add a caveat and say that they also had some really dumb ideas and lack of trying other approaches. I understand horror and most stories in general, at their core rely on characters failing to execute plans. I would for once like to see a horror movie try all rational approaches that a real person would try just so that the audience would feel like there truly are no other options. Throughout the film I was coming up with all sorts of different ways that I'd deal with this and I was a bit disappointed that the scope of their creativity was so limited.<br/><br/>Some of the characters seemed either totally unnecessary or became annoying in their persistence that the monster wasn't real. Personally, if I saw a door get blown in half, I'd probably start believing the girl that's freaking out about an invisible creature stalking her. Yara (played by Olivia Luccardi) is by far the most unnecessary character as she basically has no lines other than ""What's wrong?!"" whenever the creature approaches and Jay starts freaking out. Dude, you know what's wrong, stop asking.<br/><br/>The Judgment: The flaws of this movie are minor and easily overlooked because of the great concept and storytelling of the film. I believe that this was a solid mark on the new age of horror films and showed that it's not dead yet. David Robert Mitchell managed to bring back the spirit of old horror and give it a fresh spin. I'll definitely be looking out for a sequel to this movie that may hopefully visit the origins of the demon or conclude the story in a more permanent way. I strongly recommend this film if you're looking for a solid, original horror.<br/><br/>Check out this review and more at TheCynicist.com"

","An STD, in which it's side-effects include visions of zombified loved-ones trying to kill/sleep with you. Is this a horror movie or a 90-minute PSA for abstinence? However you interpret it, it's a brilliantly filmed and edited throwback to the early 80's, VCR horror genre. It Follows deserves a spot in the naughty isle of the Blockbuster in your mind. It captures that same unintentionally funny aspects of 80's slasher flicks. The soundtrack is quite reminiscent of Goblin. Also, for a film of such very little budget, the cinematography is world's ahead of any recent horror film of the mainstream."

","That is the moral of this story, don't have sex. But seriously, this is a very good horror movie, one of the better ones made recently. Certainly not perfect, as most horror movies aren't. It is original, and engaging though. This movie isn't as scary, as it is disturbing. I mean a thing follows you constantly, and won't stop until you pass it on, truly an original movie. It is a relatively easy watch, and recommend it for a rainy night. Again some plot holes, but overall a good movie start to finish."

","Well, i actually did not expect anything from this movie, especially after i saw this movie did not get many good reviews/stars. So i gave it a chance when i had no movie to watch, yet i found it entertaining. <br/><br/>Just like other horror movies, it began with a scene where something bad had already happened as a prologue, and as an introduction. It was quite enigmatic, and made us guess what was really happened. <br/><br/>Then the scene changed into the real story and character. Well, surprisingly, it was well-delivered story. As the story went on, the development of the character is well-built. I really enjoyed the movie. Even though the story was about sex, but the sex scene was not that vulgar. A kind of weird story, but i think the idea was original so it was nothing to be complained though. Maybe it was a low-budget movie, but it was definitely not a cheap story. Although it was not really scary, but at some scenes, it was quite thrilling and made you scream. And you don't have to wait until the movie end to know what's the matter so we don't have to keep asking the entire movie what it's all about.<br/><br/>And what i like about this movie, it's a kind of classic ghost- horror, not a nonsense-reason slasher horror."

","This has been a movie I always wanted to check out, but never got around to it. I came across it the other day on Netflix, and I had to watch it. The first thing I want to mention about this movie is it's amazing background music. I thought the music that was playing in each scene worked perfectly. It was very eerie, and suspenseful. I will say that I think the whole cat and mouse idea with these people running away from something that is following them is kind of cheesy in some parts, but I think they did make it work overall. Personally the two people that was following the main character that was very creepy, and scary was where she was in class, and she looked out the window and saw the elderly women coming towards her. The blank expressionless face from the old lady was very dark. That scene reminded me back to like if I was watching The Shining. The other person that was creepier in comparison to the others was the giant man. You first see this man when they just open the door to Jay's bedroom. You see just her sister at first, but then through the darkness appears this giant man with blackened eyes.You only see him again briefly through a window in a shack that they are hiding in on the beach. I give this movie an 8 out of 10 for its exceptional music scoring, it's dark and creepy atmosphere, and for taking such a simple idea and making a very great movie out of it."

","It follows breaks the mould of modern horrors, by lacking gore, blood and the usual set of rules. Instead this film moves at a slower pace, and relies on storytelling and the dying art of suspense. A quite unusual storyline, which sees some unknown being torment it's victim perpetually, with only them able to see it, with the victim followed day and night without any let up. The only way to escape the grips of the being, to sleep with someone and pass the curse on, or so the theory goes anyhow. A pretty clever story with lots of twists. Well acted with some decent characters. The film has one help of an accompanying soundtrack, which is straight out of the eighties, big and brash, I loved it, worked so well for the film. Some great moments, most notably the beach scene, slow and very deliberate. If you've watched Torchwood, you'll know why I was reminded of an early episode.<br/><br/>Really good film 8/10"
"ferbs54","8","0","0","26 April 2017"," A Pretty Unsettling Experience
","Whoa! I just watched one of the creepiest/spookiest films I've seen in quite a while, 2015's ""It Follows."" This film has turned out to be a popular success, an instant cult item and a critical favorite, garnering great reviews all over the place...and for good reason. In the film, pretty Jay (the excellent young actress Maika Monroe) has a sexual encounter with her current boyfriend, only to soon learn that he has passed on a curse to her. She will now be relentlessly pursued by a demon/whatzit/something wherever she goes. This whatzit can assume any form and never hurries toward its prey; only walks steadily and with purpose. To have it catch up with you spells a pretty nasty death, as the film's opening scene shows us, with another pretty victim. The only way to get this curse taken off your back is to have sex with someone else, passing the curse on effectively. But if that next person is killed by the entity, the curse reverts back to you. OK, it might sound like a pretty outlandish basis for a film, but believe me, writer/director David Robert Mitchell makes the most of it, and turns his film into a masterful exercise in horror. This is the kind of film that you just KNOW will give you a nightmare eventually. The film contains any number of frightening scenes, despite the fact that there is little overt violence and barely any blood. In my favorite, the whatzit takes the form of an old woman in pajamas, who relentlessly follows Jay through the corridors of her high school. The demon thingy later takes the form of a hollow-eyed man, a half-naked woman, Jay's own father, and on and on. Monroe is terribly sympathetic and appealing in the lead, and she is ably abetted by her young fellow actors. The film has of course been seen as a metaphor for the AIDS virus, but can be interpreted in other ways, as well. Some see the whatzit as a metaphor for the fear and uncertainty that can ensue after a sexual encounter. Others have commented that the great unease engendered by this film can be attributed to the fact that things are never really explained, and that the central whatzit has no name, such as, say, Jason, or Freddy Krueger. The ending of the picture is quite ambiguous, too, and also open to interpretation. A pretty unsettling experience, over all, and one whose spell lingers after the final reel. And, oh...the film looks amazing in high def; almost painfully crisp and clean looking. Very highly recommended, indeed!"

","Scary in a way that I haven't seen since the first ""Ring"" movie. Is it really scary? Well obviously not because we're desensitized at this point in society so nothing really scares us these days. But honestly this movie captures the scariest nightmare you just might ever have. <br/><br/>I personally liked ""It Follows"" mainly because its low budget but it delivers a chilling creepy movie that makes me never want to go to Detroit because there are scary following sex ghosts there. Haha. So is it brilliant? Nah not really but it does keep you on the edge of the seat. It's a good example of when horror is done right and doesn't depend on jump scares to scare you. <br/><br/>Best of all. What I liked about this movie is it has no moment where they research the haunting and get to the bottom of it like near every supernatural horror usually does. You know what I mean, they Google search and then take some trip to some person in some obscure place who knows all the answers. Nope! None of that. No priests, witch doctor's, mediums or supernatural experts! The closest we get to this ""research moment"" is the group of friends track down the guy who gave the girl the haunting curse. And he knows basically nothing. So this mystery just adds to the movie because it makes it more realistic not knowing.<br/><br/>I recommend only if you truly like original horror movies that are not filled with slashing, gore and blood everywhere because there is none and I mean none of that. This isn't a ""Saw"" movie."
"kastenmeier-andreas","6","0","0","16 March 2017"," Strange and Different Horror movie
","First of all, ""It Follows"" is filmed and directed very well. I liked the upgraded 80's feeling the movie was set in. Sometimes the famous horror movies of that time where clearly visible as role models. This is also represented in the basic theme of teenagers coping with their sexuality and adolescence.<br/><br/>Without spoiling much, the concept of the movie is that some kind of ""disease"" is transmitted by having sex and is following the affected persons wherever they go. The movie isn't that scary but you feel some sort of tension. There are nearly no jump scares and the movie feels fresh, which I really appreciated.<br/><br/>The movie though has it's flaws. Strangely the parents of all teenager are absent most of time, even when serious s*** is about to go down. There is no excuse mentioned. Something that I also recognized is that whenever it's convenient ""it"" shows up, regardless of it's previous location or the distances. And my major issue was, that I would have liked some more explanation (not the simple ones) of what is going on or if not a more unexpected finish of the movie.<br/><br/>Actingwise the main character of Maika Monroe is the only one, which was decent. Some of the supporting cast members really felt more like movie characters or actors than real life people.<br/><br/>The movie is a different and enjoyable horror movie. But don't expect too much, though."
"TragicBloom","5","0","0","26 February 2017"," A little tease of a movie
","The premise is actually very refreshing and promising. It invites all sorts of delicious possibilities that a true horror fan, one who doesn't need to be smacked upside the head, can appreciate. A girl has sex with her new boyfriend, who then for no explanation knocks her out and ties her up. My eyes start to roll as I assume I've wandered into a torture-porn horror flick, but NO. He drops the bomb: there's a thing chasing him, but that has now ended because he just passed it on to HER. He explains he had a fling a few weeks ago and ever since this entity has been stalking him; It can take the form of any person, strangers and loved ones alike. Its most distinguishing feature in all its forms is that it walks slowly, deliberately, and directly towards you at all times, never taking its eyes off you.<br/><br/>The only way to get rid of it, he tells her, is to have sex with another in order to pass it on. It walks, slowly, so it's easily outran, but the thing is that it never stops ... NEVER. THAT is the core of true horror, the torturously slow inevitability of death.<br/><br/>Unimaginative minds could see this as a shallow plot, but no - as the pieces fall into place you realize that this is really one hell of an idea. First, a few key pieces: 1) the thing cannot be seen by those who have not at one time had it, 2) Once you've had it, you can always see it, regardless if you're the one it's after or not, and 3) if it succeeds in killing its target, then it kills the person that had it prior, then the one prior to that, and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>You must have sex with another in order to escape it, but at the same time you know that you're basically handing over a death sentence to whoever you sleep with. Kind of heavy for anyone with a conscience. This explains so much of what can be taken as bad acting in the beginning: mainly why the boyfriend didn't seem very enthusiastic during the act with our protagonist. Dude looked like he was being inconvenienced by having that beauty love him.<br/><br/>Secondly, you realize that whoever you have sex with needs to pass it on. If they don't then it's back to you. SO you can't pick just anybody out of desperation, whomever you pass it onto needs to be attractive, easily able to bang somebody else down the road. This also means that you're forced to have that awkward ""Hey btw some monster will be stalking you from now on, best to have sex with someone else as soon as possible"" after-sex talk.<br/><br/>With these pieces in play, we're all set to learn more about this thing! Can it be killed? If so, how - bullets? Drowning? Fire? Electricity? Or perhaps logic: What would happen if the current target has sex with a past target, and the past target is killed before they can pass it on? As the IT circles back on its past targets it will inevitably come to a gap caused by already killing the repeat target. What does it do then? Does that end the curse, or does it simply hop the gap and go to the next closest in line? Where did it come from, HOW FAR BACK DOES THIS THING GO?! I mean its origin story could've been EPIC.<br/><br/>These possibilities, along with the usual enticing possibilities that come into play once it's known the thing can take the form of people you know and love, are never truly explored. The closest we get to fulfilling any of this potential is a son humped to death by his bare-chested, alcoholic mother (The thing of course) - which I got to say was pretty effectively chilling.<br/><br/>Only one imaginative idea was tried in killing it; they set up a trap at the local high school (college?) swimming pool, encircling it with all sorts of plugged in appliances. I thought that was brilliant, and was on the edge of my seat to see how it would play out. I mean, could this thing swim? Is it possible to electrocute something in an Olympic sized swimming pool? Well, we're never shown because the thing starts walking around the pool kicking in all the appliances. Our protagonist doesn't fry, but it looked like all of them might've became unplugged when they were thrown, but who the hell knows.<br/><br/>It was underwhelming. The thing had never showed intelligence (or really any will for that matter) before; it mindlessly stalks its prey regardless of the surroundings. Here all of a sudden it knows of electrocution and foils the plan by throwing all appliances into the pool. It's nonsensical on another level too, because if the protagonist dies by electrocution, then it surely would no longer be possible to hump the life out of her, now would it? This felt about halfway through the movie, but it abruptly ends soon afterwards. An awkward sex scene with her platonic male friend; they're walking down the street holding hands; could that be it far behind them?; credits roll. Lots of unfulfilled potential. We never know what happened between her and those guys at the beach. Seems she had sex with one, but if she did IT must've killed him pretty quickly afterwards. A Bullet has no effect earlier in the movie, but there by the pool we're expected to believe there's a chance it's dead? And if there's no chance it's dead, then the ending isn't open-ended, it's simply nonexistent.<br/><br/>Not a keeper, but it exercised my imagination, and there were a number of scenes I found really lol funny. (""Be back for dinner dad!"" to the naked guy standing on her roof). I suggest you see it."
"stephenabell","6","0","0","15 February 2017"," Good Premise - not fully utilised.
","The premise of this film is a good one - a person has sex and a supernatural spirit begins to follow them, with the intention of murdering them. The only way for that person to survive the entity is to have sex with someone and pass the ""curse"" onto them. Should they die then the spirit reverts back to following the last person once again.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the premise is not fully utilised in the story, there are quite a few holes. The main hole in the story is the origin of the ""curse""; we are not told it is a curse, it may be something else; we are not told why the killings are happening; or how it all started. These things deter from the story because at the end of the movie these issues made me feel as though the story was incomplete and lacking.<br/><br/>Had these issues been resolved it would have made the story and the movie a lot stronger, and possibly a lot darker and more haunting.<br/><br/>Taking that into consideration, what you do get in this movie is a strange surreal feeling, this is due to the direction and the soundtrack. These are very reminiscent of John Carpenter and David Cronenberg. It's as though they had a baby and his name was David Robert Mitchell.<br/><br/>The opening scene has John Carpenter's Halloween written all over it. The entire film took me back to my youth in the 80's and I loved it. Sometimes, though, the soundtrack was too jarring, as Cronenberg's electronic soundtrack was apt to be, though here it doesn't work as well.<br/><br/>The acting is above average with the mostly unknown cast doing a pretty decent job of adding to the tension and atmosphere of the movie. Even though there's not much gore, it's the palpable tension and atmosphere which make this a spooky supernatural story.<br/><br/>So if you like a slow burning taut eerie tale then this could be right up your street."

","I like it, but I do understand why others did not. My favorite thing about it was how they made it seems like it was in the 80s, even though they don't make a statement about it as such.<br/><br/>There are no computers, no cell phones, an old station wagon, old phones, old t.v.s, black and white movies, and casual sex. This is in the tradition of classic horror flicks of that era. But they don't actually claim it is in the 80s. Because for example, you will see some modern cars too.<br/><br/>I also loved the photography of suburban Michigan. That includes the shots of perfect cul-de-sacs, woodsy roads, and lake beaches. Of course for men there is the main character to ogle. She's just old enough so that it's not too creepy, and she's truly as appealing as her character is meant to be.<br/><br/>The creatures walk at zombie pace. You can't help but laugh. The plot is probably meant to be fun and different, and it is. Having sex makes zombies stalk you, and having sex again makes zombies stalk your new partner.<br/><br/>Yes the ending was disappointing, both for lack of action and lack of explanation. But sometimes the journey there is worth watching."

","I was happy to allow this movie to make its way to a 7/10, until what happened within the 59th minute... Thereafter, there was just no way it could recover.<br/><br/>It Follows starts off very intriguingly, and doesn't waste much time getting to the point of it's plot; that, I do like about the film.<br/><br/>From there, dumb decisions keep getting made by the lead (Jaime), and what makes it worse, is how inexplicable and unnecessary those decisions tended to be. Also, Maika's character seemed to be irritatingly inconsistent... She kept vacillating from seeming as if she moved past the incident and its consequences, to, acting as if the incident had just occurred moments earlier.<br/><br/>Another thing I don't like, is how It Follows ended... Given the nature of what causes the ""following"", It Follows for all intents and purposes, pulled out. It just, ended, which is kind of bitter sweet, because even though this movie is filled with inessential actions, you're still kind of invested in wanting to see what happens next...<br/><br/>And that, leads me to my next gripe. The origin of ""The Following"", though perhaps it's not the movies intended bearing and arc, was completely neglected. I feel delving into what caused it to begin with, would've been incredibly exciting.<br/><br/>Alas, even without the exploration of the origin, because I imagine that the directors intention was to leave that mystery to fester, what happened within the 59th minute, I just cannot forgive; and for that, this movie gets a stern, 5/10.<br/><br/>It Follows is enticing... And it does evoke a lot of curiosity, however, the 59th minute, and some unnecessary moments at pivotal points, taints what was otherwise a film, kind of worth, following."

","Drugged and tied to a wheelchair; Jay (Maika Monroe) awakes to find Hugh, her date, in a frenzy. Looking for something that can't be found, it seems, and then he screams, rolls her to the edge of a car park and points. A nude woman on the lip of an amber light, just walking directly at them, unstoppable. Jay has been cursed by Hugh, he passed the curse to her through sex, and as Jay stays alive Hugh is guaranteed to stay alive too. The curse can take the shape of any person and will work endlessly to find its next victim; it follows.<br/><br/>Set in Detroit, David Robert Mitchell uses It Follows to tell the feeling of alienation and isolation felt by teenagers in the 21st century. Each teen awkwardly interacts with one another, and adults play a remote role in the movie. Authority and structure almost seem non-existent; the police only appearance and they seem non-plus by the possibility of a rape, this creates a believable environment where the mysterious deaths of teens would not affect the community. Also, the film's monster runs along the edge of nearly every shot allowing run seamlessly into the narrative and the environment.<br/><br/>The visual tone of the film is stark, and many driving scenes roll through the decaying landscape of the 8 Mile Stretch. Some of the shots are also unique in building tension, like attaching the camera to the leg of the wheel chair or spinning the camera on its own axis to give a panoramic showing of monster and it's potential victim. Also lighting is one of the nuances of the terror; one scene early in the film has a friend opening the door, behind the hall is lit to be completely black, this allows for the monster a giant man to lurch into the shot, and my heart pulsed throughout the sequence.<br/><br/>Acting in the film is subtle for a horror movie; the actors shift from action to apathy seamlessly. Keir Gilchrist in particular adds a depth of desperation to the dreariness. His constant melancholy stares at Maika Monroe, the aimless body language and his ability for his face to express angst conveys the emotional depth of the film.<br/><br/>There is one flaw to the film; the main plot of the film is engaging up until the climax. The film final confrontation seemed a bit forced, and all too similar to the climax in Stephen King's It. The sequence isn't terrible and does have this feeling of anxious scurrying, also its significance is exposed skilfully after. It just doesn't gel with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the best English speaking horror films I have seen since The Descent; I was left feeling tense and the concept for the monster is one that should unnerve most people."

","I'm a pretty hardened horror movie watcher. Very little gets under my skin these days, for example I can quite comfortably sit and watch The Exorcist on my own, in the middle of the night and not feel a teeny weeny bit frightened. Whilst all the kids were losing their heads over The Conjuring, I sat there completely stone-faced, although that could be something to do with the crap cinema I saw it at in Loughborough which had a screen the size of a microwave. The last film to properly scare me was Sleepaway Camp, but that's only because of THAT ending Perhaps I'm not as hardened as I make out though. There have been a few recent horror films which have given me some genuine chills: Kill List, Sinister and The Babadook have all unsettled me greatly. It Follows can also be added to that list.<br/><br/>I watched It Follows alone last night and once it had finished I ran off to bed with chills tingling along my back, hopped straight into bed and threw the covers over my head like a 14 year-old girl. It's something I've not done for a while, but It Follows really got under my skin! It's been at the top of my watch list for a while after the buzz it created at all the festivals last year. Once it hit a wider release, all of the critics were raving at how brilliant it was and how it was the scariest film to come out in a decade. It Follows quickly fell into what I call the hype machine. The trouble with this is that you often let your expectations rocket to impossible heights which ends up in massive disappointment.<br/><br/>I allowed the hype to die down (and for the blu-ray to become cheaper!) and gave it a watch with lower expectations, and it worked! It's easy to see how many were disappointed when people were calling it the new Halloween and a new horror classic. I wouldn't quite go that far, but in an age full of horrendously conventional horror films with bad acting, super-fast editing and unoriginal ideas; It Follows stands head and shoulders above the rest as the superior animal. It grabbed my attention right from the opening shot which is done all in one long take. There's no shaky camera and no cutting away every two seconds, it's just one long shot of a girl running away in a panic. It feels grounded, real and completely refreshing. The incredibly cool retro synth score doesn't do it any trouble either! David Robert Mitchell is clearly someone who knows what he's doing behind the camera. The opening also culminates in a jarringly haunting image which feels like something from a nightmare. It Follows means business from the start.<br/><br/>We then follow our hero, Jay who's a blameless young adult going about her normal boring life until she decides to do a bit of innocent dogging. It results in her being cursed like a girl from Japan, but instead of a long black-haired figure following her, it's an invisible demon. It's an incredibly simple premise to pad out into a 100 minute feature film, but it absolutely works. Every single scene is filled with a strong atmosphere of complete dread because you never know when the demon is going to return, or what form it's going to take. Even scenes where Jay and her friends are sat talking are suspenseful because you can feel a presence. Someone is always watching and it makes for a nightmarish experience.<br/><br/>When the stalking demon appears, that's when stuff gets real. The film reaches its most terrifying peak when Jay and her friends stay up all night at her house to watch out for spooky happenings. I don't want to spoil it for those who are yet to see the film, but suffice to say that it has a couple of seriously nightmarish images that will stay with me for quite a long time. It's masterfully executed to squeeze out the maximum scares possible. It's scary in the same way Kairo (Pulse) was. Rather than generating quick jump scares, the imagery slowly creeps under your skin and sends sharp chills all the way up your spine. It's truly a spine-tingling experience, or at least it was for me!<br/><br/>Throughout the whole film you're basically waiting for the demon to make another appearance and because you don't know when that's going to be the film was never boring for me. The film does lean towards the art-house side, so those not familiar with arty, slow stuff might find it a little tedious. It's not the kind of film you can dip in and out of with your phone and just watch when 'something happens'. It Follows requires your full attention for it to really work.<br/><br/>It's not quite perfect though. I have to admit that although the group of characters were likable, I did find them flat. They don't really say a lot and at one point I was thinking that they could possibly be the most boring group of people you could ever hang out with! Also, I found Maika Monroe, who plays main girl, Jay distractingly attractive. I know it's my fault for being a hormonal young man but at times when I should've been completely focused on the film, I was distracted by how drop-dead gorgeous she is! She also flashed a lot of flesh which didn't help the situation. She's in a swimming costume for the thrilling finale for gawd's sake! <br/><br/>In all seriousness though, It Follows is a modern horror master-class. It's flawlessly executed and feels refreshing and original. It's also genuinely terrifying for once! I won't use the old cliché by saying 'it's the scariest film in years' because lots of scary films pop up every year if you look hard enough. I'd say it's the best horror film to come out since Babadook."

It Follows really is a great horror movie, without a doubt the scariest American one in recent memory. But actually, great horror movies are not as rare in this century as you might believe. France, the UK Australia and Japan have been cranking out tremendous horror movies for the entire 2000s. It Follows stands alone among them by being both a movie that we've seen a hundred times and one that we never would have dreamed of going to. The film is set in the suburbs of Detroit in a time that we don't know. Already the film is working on us. Cell phones show up, but so do corded ones. Typewriters, but modern cars. We have no firm place to stand on. Jay is a pretty young woman, this is about all we know. She is the protagonist. She has sex with her boyfriend. He chloroforms her and ties her up after, so he can deliver a terrifying message: she is now going to be followed. By something that can change its shape and won't stop until she is dead. He drops her off in her underwear and drives off, she can't stand up. The police have to ask if the sex was consensual. And now we come to the fascinating part of the film. The fear of sex is what drives horror. It is a laughably predictable trope: sex means you will die. But It Follows is too smart for that, or maybe too feminist. The movie knows that a woman in Western Society is either a whore or a virgin. So the monster in the film can be interpreted as female sexuality. The inescapable double standard surrounding sex, the ever-present stares of men. This is the monster. The metaphor is far from subtle, but it is incredibly effective, and the mere presence of hidden meaning and symbolism is something to be applauded. The best part about It Follows, however, is it's technical brilliance. This film features some striking cinematography. It would be fairly easy to watch the film in another language. So much is communicated visually, not just the story, but also the mood. The shots are lonely, and dark. You feel sad looking at them. They are also beautiful, ornate and well thought out. The titular IT shows up a lot in them. I especially appreciated that. It was like a Where's Waldo, only finding Waldo was essential or else the great characters would die. The soundtrack is brilliant. It hearkens back to the late '70s and '80s, in films like Halloween. Mostly synths, the music sets the mood fantastically. Director David Robert Mitchell also when to employ it. Sometimes it leads us into the scary scene, sometimes it only comes in when we are already curled up in fear. Of course, It Follows knows the two essential elements of great horror 1) Show don't tell and 2) What's off-screen is immediately scarier than what is on. It should be revered and studied for its subtly and respect for the audience. We come to our own conclusions with every scare, every character change is hidden and we must observe it our selves. It reminds me a lot of Halloween, but also The Shining. Remember the bathtub scene in that horror classic? Imagine that over and over again, and you have a sense of what It Follows is like."
"bryank-04844","10","6","21","21 July 2015"," The scariest and best horror film in years!
","It's very rare these days that a horror movie consistently delivers on genuine thrills and scares. And I'm not talking so much about the cheap ""jump out and scare you tactics"". I'm talking about a deep psychological horror that lingers in your mind for days after, causing you to look over your shoulder and think twice about those strange noises you heard. Not since 'The Babadook' has a movie been more terrifying than 'It Follows', which is a horror film from newcomer David Robert Mitchell who wrote and directed this masterpiece of horror.<br/><br/>What works so well with 'It Follows' is its simplistic nature of the unknown. We never know why this terrifying situation is happening, but it is, and the characters have to deal with it, which makes it seem more realistic and grounded, considering there weren't a lot of major visual effects. The title focuses on something that follows you. It could be someone you know or a complete stranger and it has one goal. It wants to kill you. How does one become so lucky to have something follow you? The answer is sex.<br/><br/>I thought Jason Vorhees from the 'Friday the 13th' franchise was the leader in pre- marital sex murders. He might still be the poster boy, but 'It Follows' is the new, fresh evil that awaits if you decide to go down that slippery, yet amazing slope. We follow a teenage girl named Jay (Maika Monroe from 'The Guest') who is out on a date with a guy named Hugh. As they are in the movie theater, having a good time, Hugh notices a strange girl staring at him and walking towards him. Jay cannot see her.<br/><br/>Hugh quickly leaves with Jay, playing it off, saying he doesn't feel well. The couple heads to an abandoned warehouse where the have sex. Directly after their intimate session, Jay wakes up tied to a chair where Hugh tells her she has the curse, which now she sees someone following her. Hugh gives her a few instructions on how to stay alive and then leaves. Now, Jay starts seeing a variety of scary looking people, following her day and night as this entity is trying to savagely murder her.<br/><br/>With the help of her friends and a young man named Paul (Keir Gilchrist from 'United States of Tara'), who has had a crush on Jay for years, the teens try to deal and run for their lives from this horror, while protecting Jay. David Robert Mitchell has given us a great set up for something that is truly scary. Each character has their own struggles and the dialogue between the circle of friends is the real thing. As the story progresses, so do the characters and their attempts to try and rid this evil from the world.<br/><br/>Almost every viable option is tested, even the opportunities that would have us not look at Jay in a positive light. But that's the world of teenagers when it comes to sex, or at least that's the way I remember those younger years. 'It Follows' is an innovative and fresh addition to the horror genre. It's creepiness and terror lasts for days after viewing, making you look behind you to see if anyone is indeed following you."
"doofuspoofus","5","6","21","1 April 2015"," Disappointing but not a bad film
","I'll start with the good. This movie was filmed well and paid tribute to the pace and camera techniques of horror films from the late seventies early eighties and even the score had a great eighties horror movie vibe to it. The characters were fairly interesting and the story started out intriguing. I could see the similarities to the infamous IT even obviously in the title just adding the word 'follows'.<br/><br/>I could count on one hand the scenes that truly had shock value and you have to appreciate those moments because you truly don't know exactly what's going to happen so the suspense is there. The problem I had with this film was I really didn't think the story was strong enough. There really is no decent explanation of what ""it"" actually is even though the boy who gives ""it"" to her (strangely enough through sex) goes into it a bit at the beginning. It being some sort of creature that pretty much just appears as people. Sounds interesting but at times it was like okay is that a person walking by or is that ""it"".<br/><br/>I just felt a little disappointed that ""it"" wasn't something more interesting and that ""it"" often took too long to appear not to mention how it's passed and how to get rid of it at times was clear and then confusing and why would something evil be passed through sex. Felt like this movie was written by a Mormon or something trying to make you fear pre-marital sex or something. Anyway ""it"" without a doubt unfortunately was not much more than a really twisted STD of some sort.<br/><br/>The direction was awesome and the score too and the acting was just fine but the puzzle piece missing was more intrigue, more story and a bit more horror. It was just lacking but not a bad film. Check it out but wait for Red box or Netflix."
"DerrrrDerp","8","4","12","30 October 2015"," the critics did get it right
","despite all the super low ratings here. <br/><br/>The mood, the setting and imagery are superb. It's set in a city (Detroit) which has suffered an economic apocalypse. Perfect setting and mood. <br/><br/>It is more creepy than horror, the most horrific scene starts the movie and is just a tense weirdfest for the rest of the movie. Creepy enough, I was certainly creeped out. The relationships between the teens are really sweet. Sisters and friends look out for one another. They have typical teen conversations. The lead character often does dumb things but it is a ""horror"" movie after all! I loved it!"
"loomis78-815-989034","7","4","12","5 August 2015"," Fun & Original
","Jay (Monroe) is a Michigan teenager who goes on a date with Hugh (Weary) and ends up in his car having sex. Afterward, Hugh explains to Jay that he had to pass on to her what was passed on to him. He warns that strangers will show up and try to kill her until she passes it on by having sex. Jay is stunned but only half believes him until she experiences it herself in a scary scene where she is pursued. Her sister and friends come to her aid and Jay must come to terms about what to do about the situation. The killer can look different every time but the effect and how it is used is effective and makes for some jarring moments in the film. Writer/Director David Robert Mitchell makes the most of his straight ahead plot by having a solid cast and characters you care about. All though they're adults around, we rarely see any of them during the course of the picture giving the impression that the teens are on their own to figure this out. Suspense is generated with the unsuspecting killers showing up in the corner of the frame and advancing before Jay can see them coming. This technique works quite well especially in the first half of the film and makes for some intense moments. The production design seems to be making an attempt to make this seem like it was set in the 1980's but they're too many inconsistencies to know for sure. The old school mostly electronic musical score by Disasterpeace (Rich Vreeland) is both effective and out of place depending on the sequence. When it is effective, it is refreshing and dead on perfect with the visuals, but when it is off it seems to stick out like a sore thumb. The plot wears a little thin towards the end and the up in the air ending is abrupt which may leave a bad taste in the mouth of some viewers. Overall, It Follows is a fun and original film that does supply some good chills and scares."
"medwards-14","8","4","12","3 August 2015"," Solid thriller
","Really enjoyed it and I see a lot of horror films. It's hard to find something good that hasn't been done before and this was also a simple plot. I enjoyed the suspense and could empathize with the characters. Good acting too. I look forward to the eventual sequel. It's always fun to put yourself in the place of the protagonist and ask, ""Would I do this?"" I'd put it just below the echelon of The Descent and Jeepers Creepers. It gets a few more kudos for having a no-name cast. David Robert Mitchell writes a sensational script and Maika Monroe is pretty sharp as the protagonist. What else can I say? See it and let me know if I'm wrong."
"Sci-FiHorrorFan","8","4","12","30 July 2015"," This is a Different Type of Horror Film.In my opinion This is the Best Horror Movie of 2015.
","This was a surprisingly good Horror film and the story was original and intriguing. What I liked about this Film was the Atmosphere,the film had a Dark foreboding atmosphere and I found the Film quite chilling and creepy. This Film handles its horror in a subtle fear of the unknown manner which makes it more of a psychological horror film. What I found creepy about this film is that the girl was trying to Escape from some unknown Thing that she could never truly escape from and to me that's true Horror because no matter what she does it will keep Following her.If that's not true Horror I don't know what is. <br/><br/>I think the people that didn't like this Film were expecting Another Run of the mill Slasher Film and that's why they didn't like it because it was a different type of horror film. I personally prefer this type of horror film a film that focuses on Atmosphere and fear of the unknown to creep out its viewer. I thought the directing and Writing of this film were pretty good also the Film had a creepy score that fit the Film perfectly.<br/><br/>I liked the idea to the film that an unknown supernatural force follows you everywhere you go and this unknown force gets passed to you from someone else through sex and then that person can Pass it on to someone else and only the Person that has IT can see it which is an original idea and one that I've never seen before.So I think the Film deserves some credit for doing something different at least,This film is also better than most Horror Films that come out now a days.<br/><br/>I feel that most horror films Follow the same formula but this one didn't it went in a strange and unpredictable direction. Most horror films have lame jump scares but this one had none and I liked it like that because jump scares are not scary they simply surprise you but being surprised and being scared are two totally different Things and That,s where this film succeeds because it creeps out the viewer with the Fear of the unknown. The creepy images you see in this film will stay with you when the films over but jump scares Do Not.<br/><br/>I personally find something that you don't know or understand is more scary than something you do understand,Because when you understand what It Is that's after you it's not scary anymore also having No motive is scarier than having one but in this film you never know the reason why IT FOLLOWS and that's what makes it so Scary and chilling. Now getting to the characters I personally thought they were okay they were a normal group of teenagers that hang out and have fun and I tend to like characters like that more than your cliché characters. That's another thing that made this film work I liked most of the characters and I actually felt bad for the Main Girl that was being followed by the unknown Force. <br/><br/>The acting was actually quite good from the Main teenagers,I found them convincing whenever they got scared.Maika Monroe played her part very well and she fit the part.(I also thought she looked pretty good too). I liked that her friends stood by her and tried to help her they didn't give up on her,they stood by her even though they didn't understand what was going on.that showed she had good friends it also made them likable. The Film also has good cinematography and the pacing was good I never got bored by the Film.<br/><br/>Warning Big Spoilers Bellow!.<br/><br/>I don't have many problems with the film maybe only three. 1 we never find out what the unknown creature is or where it comes from. 2 the unknown creature made itself look weird a lot of times which I thought was a bit stupid because it gave itself Away by doing that. (I knew it was the creature). Since this creature can make itself look like anyone it would have been smarter if it made itself look like the girls mother or Sister because then it could trick her and kill her.Instead The Creature makes itself look like old ladies,weird girls and Tall looking men with Strange eyes,which I thought was way too weird not to mention obvious.<br/><br/>3 the boyfriend character is the one that passed the unknown creature on to her in the first place just so he could save himself and yet later in the Film when the girl and her friends go to his house they are not even Angry with him for what he did which I found weird because it was his fault that this Thing is Following them in the first place yet nobody blames him at all which is very odd because I definitely would.Those were just some small problems I had with the film but they were not enough to destroy my enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>Overall it's still a good film and I recommend it.The Film was not Terrifying I just found it very chilling and suspenseful and the Ending fight against the unknown creature was entertaining. I liked the Film and I would definitely watch it again."
"blakiepeterson","9","4","12","26 July 2015"," A Horror Classic in the Making
","The first time I watched ""Halloween"" was all the way back in October 2012, on Halloween night, to be exact. I was fifteen-years-old, had never considered myself to be a horror fan, and didn't have a clue what made the film such a hit among slasher buffs. Midway through the harrowing climax, my sister, who had gone out trick-or-treating all night, crept up to the living room's back window and banged on the pane as hard as she could. That should have been the fright of my life, but ""Halloween"", as it turns out, is so scary that a quick jolt hardly compares to the lasting disturbia of its nuts and bolts. Everything about it is straight out of a hyper-realistic nightmare you might have had after a night of anxiety attacks — the score, the acting, and of course, the sight of Michael Myers' mask are still enough to cause me to collapse into a puddle of yesterday's confidence. And despite the fact that the film is really and truly an exercise in horror, the scene that has lasted with me the longest is the final scene, which, after a few seconds of regrouping, cuts to a shot of Laurie Strode's lawn from the view of the balcony. There, the body of Michael Myers (recently shot) should have been strewn. But after barely recovering from her attack, Laurie peers over the ledge and finds him gone. On the loose. Ready to kill. Again.<br/><br/>When putting my movie watching history into consideration, ambiguity is the tool that seems to make a horror movie work for me. My personal favorite, ""The Blair Witch Project"", was such a masterpiece because the fear was never fully explained, despite seeing monstrosity after monstrosity occur before our very eyes; and in other excellent works, such as ""The Innocents"" or ""The Babadook"", the villain on the prowl is kept invisible, while we collapse in fear over the mental detonation that befalls its protagonist. <br/><br/>Horror is one of the few genres that rarely seems to work — because the main goal is to scare, much of the plot points have a similar air, even the gems ringing with a sort of depressing familiarity. And considering the genre has been around since the 1920s, it seems to be, especially as of late, increasingly difficult to make a chiller completely new and completely disturbing.<br/><br/>Finally, we have a mood piece worthy of the hype: ""It Follows"" is one of the best, if not the best, horror movie of the 2010s. It takes the best of Carpenter, the most subdued of Argento, and the ghostliest of Romero and makes for the most outrightly ominous terror train of recent years. It sticks with you — no, scratch that: it follows you — for much too long, individual scenes as impactive as the aforementioned finale sequence of ""Halloween"". As of right now, it may be denoted as a terrifying indie sensation that pushed past its low- budget constraints and broke the ground. But in twenty years, it might be a golden egg horror buffs gaze upon like a stack of one-hundred dollar bills, the knight in shining armor that saved the genre from completely collapsing into hardly seen independent fare.<br/><br/>The monster stalking the premises is not an axe wielding murderer or a snaggletoothed demon but a soulless entity who menaces a victim at a time. The victim in ""It Follows"" is Jay Height (the wonderful Maika Monroe), a blonde college student whose life is turned upside down after spontaneously having sex with date. The guy (Jake Weary), it seems, did not undergo the act as a deed of passion but as one of necessity. He is being staked by the previously mentioned ghoul, who follows him, like a zombie, wherever he goes. Like an STD, the fiend seems to travel from victim to victim through intercourse — but if the person on the receiving end of the devilish transfer is killed, it goes right back to its previous owner. It's a cycle of the most vicious quality, making life a living hell for anyone touched by the curse. Jay, a heroine in the same spirit as Laurie Strode and Dana Polk, isn't content passably sitting like a helpless victim, doing everything she can to survive and figure out to end the problem, her clueless friends in tow.<br/><br/>In concept alone, ""It Follows"" is intriguing to the highest caliber, but execution is what makes a film what it is and David Cameron Mitchell is an auteur of enormous potential. Some scenes have the specificity of a severely darkened Wes Anderson flick, others drowned in uncomfortably colorful dread only found in the finest Bava. He's intensely concerned about texture and sound — the tone, unrelentingly gutted by dread, is threatening enough to cause the Blair Witch to back off; the score, emulating ""Halloween"" and the chamber stealth of an Ennio Morricone scored giallo, sends a rippling effect of panic through the body. If it were flatly shot, ""It Follows"" would be frightening, but not emotionally stimulating. And because Mitchell's dynamic is so saturated and so eerie, we don't solely jump in fright at the nearest cat-at-the-camera scare; we feel so blatantly terrorized that we become certain that maybe it's following us.<br/><br/>Ghostly, stylish, and deliriously terrifying, ""It Follows"" is a classic in the making, a supernaturally subtle piece of uncompromising power. It renews what we've come to love about the horror genre, injecting much needed adrenaline in the long suffering brand. More, please."
"skybrick736","9","4","12","26 July 2015"," It Follows
","Every so often, there is a non-mainstream horror film that comes out with a lot of buzz and actually delivers. It Follows is one of those films, having a totally original script, which is flat-out brilliantly made. The characters are genuine and moving giving the audience an emotional attachment, seeming that we possess the same fear they are facing. The fear being a slow-stalking entity that persistently follows a person after intercourse. The anti-sex message is painfully strong, even if the director/writer, David Robert Mitchell intended for it. Mitchell's scenes were deliberate and perfectly written and acted even the chaotic scenes that were fast paced. <br/><br/>Credit also has to go towards Maika Monroe, the stunning lead actress had a very ""girl next door"" appearance, played her role flawlessly. The rest of the cast were great fits and contributed excellently but they didn't hold a torch to Monroe. Another attribute of the film that was fresh and provided a hard hitting downer of an atmosphere was the music score. The score is fantastic, and started whenever a chase occurred or was just about to, very similar to Michael Myers and the Halloween theme song. The film progressively gives clues to what will eventually happen throughout the course of the film but it's still not as predictable as one would think. It Follows is going to go down as one of the best horror films of this decade and a must watch."

","Imagine yourself surrounded with strangers any of whom might be the entity trying to kill you. It could be anyone from someone passing thru your neighborhood to someone creepy you see at school. It doesn't really matter how slow that entity moves, it will always get you when you have your pants down.<br/><br/>This is absolutely a great psychological horror movie that has pumped fresh air into horror genre. Horror fans like me were really getting tired of seeing the same type of clichés that have been repeating in 99% of all horror movies. Now they don't even bother putting some thought into the movies they make to avoid plot holes or goofs.Probably because producers are targeting the young that have nothing to do on a weekend night, and willing to get some profit putting in very little.<br/><br/>With It follows, I am hoping things will change and we will see better, more thought-provoking movies that will nail us down and keep us under effect for weeks, which I honestly expect from a good movie, no matter what genre."
"yesserlaham","3","3","8","2 February 2017"," Disappointed and IT FOLLOWS ME!!!
","Whoever recommended ""It Follows"" to me, with all my respect--- never mind, I'll save it. But just watched it last night and here's what I think: Great visuals and cinematography, some really cool eerie music, awful writing and story, decent to average acting, but then again due to the horrendous story writing. First of all- all characters are unlikable and 10 minutes into the movie and I have no problem with them dying already because I never cared enough for any of them in the first place. All typical, shallow, flat undeveloped characters with bad attitudes. Sorry but it takes more than just being really pretty to care if s*** starts happening to you. We talk a lot about the importance of writing characters that readers like or can relate to, but this- -? Storyline: basically something really creepy FOLLOWS you and you have to sleep around with people to pass it on/along to them and hopefully maybe it will stop following you and follow them instead- or maybe not? We know nothing about that thing's backstory or why it's doing the horrible things that it's doing, how does it work and does it just pick people? Did it just show up one day? Are they like zombies or ghosts? Again what do they want? Nothing is explained. Now general stupidity and character errors: The lead is at home with her sister and THREE other friends when she starts seeing that ""thing"" and it starts following her so she hides in her room. She goes from NOT being OK if her sister leaves her with their THREE other friends in her bedroom to go get her some water just from the kitchen downstairs, freaking out about it telling her ""don't leave me"", she goes from that to running in the creepiest woods all ALONE just like a minute later. I'm like are you bipolar? A minute ago you yelled at your sister when she offered to go get you some water while your 3 other friends are sitting with you to protect and comfort you- again in your room, the safest place, and now you're wandering ALONE in the middle of the night just to sit in a swing? It's like an accident waiting to happen. How do you connect these two? Just stupid. And then the incredibly slow pace at times, like how much time do you need to tell that someone is swimming in the pool? 5 Minutes?! BORING! Now expositions that just aren't believable: ""When I was a little girl, my parents wouldn't allow me to go south of eight mile. I mean I had to ask permission to go to the state fair with my best friend and her parents just because it was a few blocks past the border!!"" Now I would buy that if I see anything that proves it from today's life. I've only seen your mom in like one scene in the beginning of the movie that's an hour and a half long, you're still underage and you go to school, your mom/ parents have no clue where you're spending your days and nights or what's going on with you when you have all your friends over; we just never see her. One night you sleep in a public park, in a swing, the other night on top of your car not even in it, and then on the beach the day after, and then in an isolated cabin in the woods in the middle of nowhere that you drove to with your bunch of teenage friends. And then 3 days in a hospital?! Where's the so called overly protective mother in all of this? Knowing that she did appear at the beginning. Could they not hire her for a few more scenes? And then the resolution at the end- what resolution?! Still, nothing is explained?! I was hoping something would happen at the end that would miraculously change my mind, blow me away and surprise me, it did but for all the wrong reasons. I wouldn't say it was a total waste of time despite how frustrated I was when it ended, because the shots and cinematography were dope and gave me some great ideas!! IMDb ratings, I always knew you weren't to be trusted!! People, how could you possibly suggest it telling me ""it's the best horror movie ever!!"" Have you NOT learned proper screen writing?!"

I've seen some bad horror movies, and this film is a bad horror film. it doesn't reinvent anything, it barely has a new idea, and it doesn't do very well with executing that idea. <br/><br/>we are supposed to guess what the main character is thinking the whole time. we are supposed to infer why she sleeps with who, and be able to guess the reasoning. this is meant to thrill us as the viewer and make us think we are smart. ""oh she didn't sleep with him because she loves him and doesn't want him to die."" it's so obvious we are supposed to infer that, it's like forced down our throats. cheap, cheap writing. <br/><br/>really doesn't live up to any hype. doesn't deserve its rating. the only good thing I have to say about the movie is the cast do very well, and you don't want them to die. and the music was really good, it's the type of music I love to hear in films. however neither of these points are reason enough to watch it. the film is forced, tries to be deep, and the film makers are trying too hard."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","3","8","11 January 2016"," Most horror films don't even try half the things 'It Follows' expertly achieves
","There are scary movies and then there are horror films. Scary movies make up the overwhelming bulk of the ""horror"" landscape — these days it's supernatural haunting films stacked with jump-scares and creepy little kids. Conceptually, ""It Follows"" appears to be in that vein, but David Robert Mitchell's sophomore feature film has artistic inclinations that elevate it well above schlock. The flip-side is that for every film buff who appreciates it, a horror junkie might be a little underwhelmed. To the junkies, I say too bad — ""It Follows"" is a retro-style horror triumph.<br/><br/>Part coming-of-age film, part supernatural slasher movie, ""It Follows"" centers on Jay (Maika Monroe), a 19-year-old in suburban Detroit whose romantic hookup with Hugh (Jake Weary) takes a turn for the terrifying when he reveals to her that he's passed something on to her — an ""it"" that takes on various human forms and will follow her until it kills her or she's able to pass it on to someone else.<br/><br/>Jay doesn't really believe it at first, but when it becomes clear that she's never safe in one place for long before some creepy, half- or fully-naked being comes after her, she enlists the help of her sister and some friends to help her figure out her next move.<br/><br/>Jay and her friends appear to be living in contemporary times, but there's a conscious absence of most technology and the inclusion of older car models and box TV sets, creating the aesthetic of a '70s suburban slasher movie. Combined with the subtle but haunting electronic score, ""It Follows"" is a pretty clear homage to John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" — suburbia honestly hasn't looked this creepy on film since the slasher heyday.<br/><br/>That's just one of the many horror sensibilities that Mitchell absolutely nails. His use of 360-degree camera pans and his overall patience with the camera in an era when horror movies seem to require moments of hand-held panic and chaos serve as not only the ultimate throwback to great '70s horror movies (I'm including ""The Shining"" in that category), but add to the thrill-level of the film experience.<br/><br/>""It Follows"" does have moments when it caves to contemporary techniques and puts aside its slow-burn tactics, and they're among the weaker parts of the movie to be sure, but they don't sink it. In an effort to ratchet up the plot, the characters do have some extremely close encounters with ""it"" after a handful of hide-and-seek sequences, but what matters more is that Mitchell insists on keeping the audience in the dark and does not yield information that would compromise the mystery of ""it."" This will infuriate some folks, but it's part of what separates ""It Follows"" from its peers.<br/><br/>Symbolism is also a device Mitchell employs in spades that quickly elevates the film. That — and poetry, literature and foreshadow. ""It Follows"" could actually be the first horror film appropriate for a high school English class. Mitchell's liberal but calculated use of these techniques adds layers upon layers to the movie and it evolves into so much more than an eerie and effective horror concept. Whether it's the sexual or erotic imagery or the symbolism presented by the many bodies of water that appear throughout the film, these are just some examples of the way the film tackles bigger, more relevant questions that most horror films don't aspire to even scratch the surface of, the biggest of which is most definitely loss of innocence. It's clear that ""It Follows"" is as much about growing up and the terror that comes with it as it is the terror of running from certain death.<br/><br/>Even if it doesn't reach the level of thrills that ought to accompany a sit-down with a horror flick, the sheer depth and degree of intention in ""It Follows"" is staggering. Mitchell hasn't crafted a masterpiece exactly, but his film does so many things and goes so many places that others with similar concepts flat out don't, and they all blend together into this contemporary indie throwback horror film that stands tall.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","It Follows you is certainly refreshing in this day and age of horror films. Not once does it rely on a jump scare. It doesn't even rely on gore too much. It just is quite unsettling at times. I like the fact that there isn't much back story about this so called ""it"". I think that makes it even more creepier. You don't what it is, where it came from, how to stop it. It's just there...and you can't do anything about it. It's incredibly effective and I wish more writers/directors/producers were taking risks and coming up with more original content like this.<br/><br/>Now while I certainly like the idea behind this movie, I wish they maybe had a different cast or more interesting characters. I wasn't that compelled by the lead actress. She certainly was better than the majority of the cast, but there was a number of times where she just seemed flat and emotionless. And I'm talking about BEFORE the attack when her life was normal. The scenes with her hanging out with her friends are boring, her going out on a date was boring. There was nothing really interesting about the characters themselves. And that sucks because I felt like I could have given up on this movie so easily. Sometimes, the direction just seemed like it was trying to hard to be artsy fartsy. Like, oooh lets a close-up of her lining up blades of grass on her leg. Why? Why is that needed? And I didn't care for the score either. Trying to hard to be reminiscent of the 80s. <br/><br/>What truly makes this film work, and why I think its worth a watch is because ""IT"" is effective. I honestly had a knot in my stomach during the horror parts. Sometimes what is most scary is that feeling of helplessness. And that is what this movie accomplishes."

What a pointless plot, with actors that had only two expressions - bored and slightly worried / scared. It's been ages since I have seen a great horror flick, but reading everyone else's reviews I just don't understand.

I was intrigued for the first hour, but it just didn't seem To go anywhere, I feel that a better director was in need because th actors were great but the plot was, BAD. ""It"" never got identified which is leaving us with mystery but I really was looking forward to finding what ""it"" is. I noticed, a cool film shot though. When the guy (it) near the end was at the pool throwing stuff at Jay in the pool, after that scene it had a slow zoom on the family portrait, and the guy(it) at the pool was Jay's Dad or uncle or some relative. but I do think that is something that could've been jumped into more, because I think that was just an empty hole leading to nowhere like this movie. unfortunately it's gonna give you nightmares of how bad it was, I wouldn't see it again, Don't think you should waist 1:30 hrs and $15 on watching it.

","Overall I don't have much to add that the other low-star reviewers haven't said already. Most of their comments are right on the money.

Maybe it should have been called ""It Falters"". I'm giving it 3 stars because: 1) writer/director D.R.Mitchell wanted to invoke the classic 70's/80's horror movie vibe, and he pulled that off pretty well; 2) he managed to get it his project made *and* released, which is an admirable accomplishment; 3) he's somehow managed to dupe a crap-ton of reviewers into thinking this was somehow groundbreaking, innovative, or any level of scary or even entertaining. So good for him, 3- stars. As for we viewers, I strongly suggest you save your money and wait for something that actually lives up to its hype. An ""instant classic""? Hardly - I'll give this thing 3 months to ride the hype, then no one will even remember it existed."

","I had read that this film was one of the most scary films in recent years and after spending the entire duration of the movie waiting to be scared, I am still waiting. I am not in the least a little bit ""creeped out."" Very disappointing for an avid fan of horror genre.<br/><br/>After the first 10 minutes, it occurred to me and others who were watching the movie with me that it is a film about sexually transmitted diseases. I'm sure we are not the only ones. It is not about a specific evil entity in any traditional sense. It's a cautionary PSA: one should be careful with whom one casually choose to have sex; terrible consequences could ""follow"" otherwise. That is all good except I was expecting to see a scary movie.<br/><br/>Nothing was explained in the film. No origin story of the evil in question. No explanation of what the kids did what they did to try to get rid of it. It could be intentional to illustrate that young adults have no clue to deal with disasters that they bring upon themselves. However, they also did not receive or ask for help from outside of their circle. The whole situation is unsatisfying and unrealistic.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is jarring to me. I understand that it is dated because the setting of the movie is dated. But it did not add anything for me except annoyance. <br/><br/>As far as the world in the film being dated, I understand the reason for it. There is no plasma TV and the kids only watches really old movies. There was no computer, no World Wide Web, and therefore no information on their fingertips. The teenagers are cut off from help in all directions. They can't search online for the reason(s) that they were haunted. They can't find out how to get rid of it. They don't even ask for help from outside which kind of boggles the mind. I think the effort to create the situation in which these teens are isolated does not make too much sense. Even in the late 70s or early 80s, there are resources they can rely on apart from social medias. Try the libraries or archives.<br/><br/>There are some classic movie and literary references in the film which tells me that someone is trying to give this project an intellectual angle but the effort was shallow and clumsily done.<br/><br/>All in all, not that great."

","It Follows (2015)<br/><br/>Turbo review: great photography, lame premise. So it fits in with lots of lower budget horror films, scary and a little stupid at the same time. For some it will be scary enough to not matter—that's the point, right? And the cinematography is really very very nice.<br/><br/>It's also a male-gaze movie. Meaning that it has lots of young women with few clothes and the camera staring at them. Not sure if director/writer David Robert Mitchell is still working through puberty (his pictures show him very young, so it's not a stretch), but I found it a bit insulting and unnecessary. It cheapens the whole thing, even though it's a questionable quality of lots of horror films to demean the women in the story.<br/><br/>What works least is the main idea: some kind of force, not purely psychological, makes the victim see some kind of changeable person follow them. Everywhere. But always on foot, like a zombie. But with strangely fast and dangerous powers, too, whenever the scene requires. There is no rationale for this, no history, no nothing—it just happens to be the premise of the movie, and so there you have it. Let down your guard and like it, or question it (as I did) and get annoyed.<br/><br/>The acting is not bad, but that's putting it on some kind of low budget horror film scale. It's meant to be ""normal"" and it is, with some uneven performances. What does rise above is the visual panache, which is wonderful. It might actually be low budget, too, but it doesn't matter—cinematographer Mike Gioulakis makes the most of his digital camera rigs and over-the-top (not quite naturalistic) lighting. It's almost a requirement for students to watch for how to make the most out of simple equipment. Nice!<br/><br/>You'll have to decide whether this saves the movie.

"kevin-38242","5","3","9","14 September 2015"," Different, but plot and acting do not live up to the cinematography
","It's good to see a movie which is clearly made by a team that still sees cinema as an art form, rather than nothing more than a cynical way to part people from their money. The presentation is spooky, weird, and atmospheric; the music -- although not something I would listen to other than as a film soundtrack -- is a good fit to the 80s-style dystopian environment in which the action takes place . The film is mostly not outright scary, but it was tense and creepy. I was willing to forgive it a great deal.<br/><br/>In the end, though, it didn't convince me, because the plot isn't even internally consistent, the characters do not behave in a credible way, and the acting isn't compelling enough to conceal these facts. Now, I'm not a complete reactionary, and I accept that a convincing story can be told without adhering to a real-world, linear-time narrative. But the story does have to hold at least to the basic premises of the fantastical world in which it is played out; characters have to behave in a way that is at least broadly recognizable as compatible with human nature.<br/><br/>Yet here we have a woman who is cynically induced into a sexual relationship so that her partner can pass on a 'curse' to her. You might expect that, when these characters meet again, there will at least be harsh words, if not violence. And yet the woman and her friends -- who in any real-world scenario would be spitting mad -- seem not to realize that they're dealing with an exploitative, wicked man. Later they casually discuss the possibility of female lead's passing on the curse in the same way, with no obvious interest in the ethical implications. Real folks just don't behave in the way this film portrays them -- not even teenagers. The characters are young people with homes and parents, and yet neither homes nor parents feature in the story, even in situations where we might reasonably expect them to, given the way in which they are portrayed.<br/><br/>The monster, or demon, or whatever it is, can clearly transport itself over large distances by non-physical means, yet cannot cope with a locked door. In the vicinity of the victim, it can't seem to move faster than a shamble, and yet it can climb onto a roof. It changes form unpredictably in a surreal, nightmare-like way, yet it has a physical presence and interacts with characters other than those subject to the curse, even though they cannot see it. Movie monsters don't have to obey real-world limitations, of course, but they do have to behave in ways that are self-consistent, and compatible at least with the laws of physics as they are interpreted in the fantasy world created by the story. The Terminator, for example, can withstand a shotgun blast, but the human characters don't have to worry that it can teleport or read their minds, because that would be inconsistent with the story as it is told. The ""It,"" however, has no character or properties that make sense even in the film's own world.<br/><br/>I did not expect a happy ending to this film, but I did expect _an_ ending. However, it appears if the writer just wrote a bunch of spooky scenes and then ran out of ideas. I felt that the picture could have just faded to black at any point in the last 30 minutes, and it would have made no difference.<br/><br/>In summary, a nicely-made, atmospheric movie, badly let down because the writer did not seem to know whether he was describing a sequence of events that took place in some world, albeit possibly a fantastical one, or a nightmare with no logic or consistency at all."
"ghatfield69","3","15","79","7 May 2015"," Meh! Honest review by a horror fan!
","It seemed that this movie had potential to be good, but fell short! Acting was good by the cast, but the film never explained the origin of the curse. In the opening scene we see a girl confused and frantically running in pump heels. She ends up dead at the beach with her limbs broken. The movie looked like it had potential! The main girl beds down with a boy she met and he passes the curse to our lead star. The rest of the film is this girl being chased by sometimes naked and very un-scary pursuers. The movie is plagued by the typical pitfalls, 1.Lead actress never explains to her friends what is happening. 2. She runs off by herself in dark areas. 3. Her guy friends know that she's cursed, but still want to tap her cursed vajayjay! 4. All her friends know that evil is out to get her, but can sleep together in the same room. The film tries it hand at CGI and falls flat on its face! The effects look bad! In the final scene the friends set up a swimming pool with several appliances setup around its perimeter. Hmmmm, wonder where they found all those extension cords and toasters? Anyway, the plan was to lure the evil follower into the pool and zap it like a bug! Finally, the worst move a movie could make.... an incomplete cliché drop to the ending credits. I felt ripped off! Can't film makers do better than that? Its just the easy way out and very non-original! I saw there were several reviews stating that this was an original story! I can count several other films with the same plot! I believe that a lot of these reviews are from people who had a direct connection in the making or funding of this film. I get it, it's business! I have to admit the movie had me hooked, I probably wouldn't of been so bitter if they didn't give up on the ending and stayed with practical effects! Instead the post production crew used an Ipad app to create the CGI. I love horror films, just hope the sequel is better! Pros, the actors were good, the background music was right on! John Carpenter all the way. Not sure if it was meant to be(budget), but hats off! younger readers might not get the Carpenter thing!"

Someone else says on IMDb that it is one of the best horrors of the decade so far - give me a break!

Most horror is like popcorn, and as forgettable as is most movie snacks. Not so with this one, every shot communicated more than most of the dialog in any movie, visually stunning and unforgettable. The premise was creative the actors fell right into their roles and were captured beautifully. I've never recommended a horror movie in my life, but have passed on several recommendations to friends because they need to see what *can* be done, as opposed to what is usually done. The ending makes me think that there is an opening for a sequel, which I pray is able to compare to what It Follows."
"ASouthernHorrorFan","8","4","14","16 October 2015"," My Review Of ""It Follows""
","The cast give great performances bringing these ""half-dead, unmotivated, wasted young"" formations of teenage 'angsters' to life. The cinematography is more indie than the usual MTV produced films that have come out before ""It Follows"", and the total lack of product placement that screams 21st century cinema is refreshing. The story is very dark, with some real emotion that seeps in just enough for fans to connect with the horror that is teen logic and lack of parental supervision. Then add the actual nightmare of consequence in the form of a demon, (which is obviously a show of blatant disregard for sexual responsibility, and the spread of STD's), is really entertaining and thrilling to watch play out. <br/><br/>The special effects hang on a mix of chilling suspense as we see the characters reaction to some f'ed up personas that the demon uses while stalking the victims, strong bass driven sound effects that instantly put you on guard anticipating the approaching horror. The special effects stay mixed between really cool practical effects and the necessary CGI stuff. The soundtrack is as off beat, and indie as the filming style choice, and the set designs. Honestly it is all just really impressive, and even though it is Hollywood level production, everything looks and feels so indie. <br/><br/>Overall ""It Follows"" is a great return to classic horror film movie making, and filled with plenty of terrifying moments to delight most horror fans. The gore is limited, and the kills are on the mild side, but most of the film is just so intense, dark, and filled with chilling atmosphere that the build up to the actual kill/death scene gives good scare. My only disappointment was the f'ed up ending. If you can call it that. Yeah I know it is a creative way to say that the story is not over, because sex and youth making bad choices is eternal, much like the evil and darkness that accompanies all our choices in this complicated life. Still it ticked me off a bit, they could have took a few steps more with that final scene instead of the one they went with, maybe a small reactionary moment with the characters. Anyway ""It Follows"" is a great modern horror film that deserves props for originality and a definitive return to classic nightmare story telling."
"dee.reid","8","4","14","12 October 2015"," ""It Follows"" is sure to develop a sizable cult following...
","The new 2014 horror film ""It Follows"" (released earlier this year in March of 2015) is one of the most talked-about horror films to come out in years. ""It Follows"" is, in many ways, a kind of throwback to the relatively gore-free, atmosphere-rich shock-fests of the 1970s, with films such as ""The Exorcist"" (1973) and ""Halloween"" (1978) - the latter of which this film invokes especially during the course of its 100-minute running time. And because of these deliberate invocations of horror films from 40 years ago (while also breaking with a number of well-known horror movie traditions and stereotypes), it's hard to not buy into the high amount of praise ""It Follows"" has received.<br/><br/>Writer and director David Robert Mitchell has stated in interviews that ""It Follows"" is rooted in nightmares he suffered from as a child, where he was chased by a malevolent, slow-moving, shape-shifting supernatural entity that followed him everywhere he went. This idea managed to work its way into his second feature, where Detroit teenagers on the cusp of adulthood find themselves stalked by such a supernatural entity.<br/><br/>The film opens unsettlingly enough - and with a pulsating synthesizer score by Disasterpeace (which is another key invocation from the 1970s) - with a scantily-clad young girl running from her house, getting into her car, and driving away. We next see her on the beach, tearfully calling her parents and telling her how much she loves them and that she's sorry for all the bad things that she's put them through. The next morning, the young girl is found brutally murdered.<br/><br/>We're then introduced to Jay Height (Maika Monroe). Jay has a date with a 21-year-old hunk named Hugh (Jake Weary) that starts innocently enough. We next see them having sex in the backseat of his car. From this little encounter, Jay soon finds herself stalked by the malevolent, shape-changing supernatural entity (of Mitchell's childhood nightmares, remember) that will follow her everywhere she goes until it finally kills her - unless she can save herself by having sex with someone else and thus passing the curse along to them (even though we also learn that's really no guarantee she'll be fine - because if it kills the next person she passes it on to, it will come back for her).<br/><br/>So she has to call upon her friends to help her extinguish a lethargic, invisible entity that only she can see, and this does lead to some genuinely frightening moments later on in the film (in particular, a climatic final showdown involving the teens at a community swimming pool).<br/><br/>Many reviewers have also read into this film's events as an allegory on the dangers of STDs and promiscuous sex. When ""Scream"" (1996) premiered 19 years ago, it commented - albeit satirically - on how it is usually in slasher films (""Halloween,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" etc.), that the virgin always survives and that one of the only ways to not die in a horror movie is to simply abstain from having sex. (This has caused some to analyze some movie slashers such as Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees as moral avengers slaying promiscuous, drug-abusing teenagers and young adults.)<br/><br/>But in ""It Follows,"" that concept is turned on its head: sex is the only way to survive. But the filmmakers are not saying that sex is the key to prolonging one's existence here - however long that may be, since, according to the ""rules"" surrounding the creature/curse here, there's no guarantee of survival by simply passing ""it"" along to another person. The filmmakers have commented that the STD comparison is a fair interpretation, but David Robert Mitchell seems to suggest that it's more about the fear of your own mortality - and yet sex in itself, is about living, and connecting, physically and emotionally, with someone else. Personally, I would even go further to suggest the possibility that the film is really more about the fear of the unseen, the unknown - which can also connect to a fear of death, which many people, especially young people, cannot see or comprehend: These teens, in a figurative sense as well as a literal sense, must out-run death, from which there may ultimately be no escape. Really, any interpretation is fair here, and key to understanding the feature.<br/><br/>""It Follows"" is one of the best new horror films of the new millennium. It has a low budget, but like a lot of low-budget horror features, it is also stunningly well-made but most importantly, it has ambitions, ideas, that are realized in spite of its financial limitations. I've commented in the past that the British cult classic ""The Descent"" (2005) is the best and scariest horror movie I've seen so far since the beginning of the 21st century; like ""It Follows,"" ""The Descent"" was also inspired by horror films of the 1970s, which is perhaps why these two films are so outstanding on a number of levels to me.<br/><br/>This film will definitely require multiple viewings to fully understand everything it has to offer you.<br/><br/>8/10"

A young girl finds a shape-shifting supernatural being following her after a bizarre sexual encounter. <br/><br/>Is ""it"" a metaphor for sexual regret? <br/><br/>She then attempts to figure what ""it"" is, and how to rid herself of ""it"".<br/><br/>Clever film wisely avoids shaky cam, and needlessly cheap jumpscares, instead building feelings of dread and fear and unease. And disorientation: people have cell phones and tablets, but also 1970s television sets (and a lot of them shown throughout the entire film) Does this occur in present day, 2010s, or in the 1970s? And where is the story set? It almost looks like California in some scenes, maybe Detroit slums in others (pool scene takes place in an abandoned Detroit Rec. Centre, though)<br/><br/>Subtle, quiet horror also benefits from its intentionally disorienting photography, in which the background action is the focus of some scenes, not the foreground. <br/><br/>Story implies that she gives ""it"" to someone else, with the intention of him quickly giving it to a prostitute- but it wouldn't take ""it"" long to stalk and kill them and be right back after her again. The same can be said about implications of her banging one or more of the guys on the boat in the lake.<br/><br/>Abrupt, anticlimactic ending, yet it works on several levels. <br/><br/>I didn't understand the purpose of the flatulent, constantly chewing character, Yara, who seemed to be nothing more than a pity friend, someone the main characters hung out with only because they felt sorry for her, not because they were really friends, or because she had anything to do with the plot. My interest waned in the penultimate scene, as Yara chewed and read aloud, I found my mind start to wander momentarily. <br/><br/>A good double feature can be made with this film and the simultaneously released, Unfriended."

But that didn't happen. I enjoyed the film, and there were some really good tense, scary moments in it.

It was, for example, superbly shot, with great settings, and the overall premise is an engaging one. In many scenes you're aware that the threat might come from anywhere, and that aspect of the film was excellent. And the soundtrack! Outstanding!"
"jakesmail-40013","9","4","15","21 August 2015"," Not mindless entertainment
","I came into this movie very neutral as I just heard a friend talk about it and decided to look into it since I am a huge fan of the horror genre. The first thing I want to address is the amount of negative reviews here. It seems most of these reviews are written by people that don't want to think about things or are really into the current trend of horror which is gore/slasher. (Which is totally acceptable)<br/><br/>If you're okay with not having to know every single little detail about something then this movie will be just fine for you. If you don't particularly care about blood and gore this movie will be just fine for you. If you're the kind of person who likes to just sit back, ""turn off"" your mind and enjoy a film, this movie is NOT for you. You need to let yourself think about the characters and the plot. Don't come in with expectations, (as you should do with all movies) good or bad. This movie wasn't the most horrifying but I did think it was exciting. I love when I, the viewer, get to make the connections and look for every small detail in every scene and connect the dots to form a better picture of what's going on. This movie is filled with symbolism and it's not always easy to pick up on but it is rewarding when you find out what certain things in the movie represent or foreshadow.<br/><br/>If you enjoy being interactive with what you're watching then I definitely recommend this movie to you. Don't let hastily written negative reviews stop you from seeing this movie if you have the time to spare and if anything I've written about it interests you."

","Though I did know the basic premise of this movie before seeing it, I didn't know anything else about it apart from the fact it was getting excellent word of mouth. So I didn't have any real expectations except to get spooked to a certain degree. I did find the movie reasonably creepy... but I don't think every horror fan will embrace the movie. I will list what I liked about the movie. The premise (which I won't spoil) had some originality to it. I also liked the fact that the movie seemed to be trying hard to emulate the kind of regional horror movies that came out in the early 1980s or so, such as the dark cinematography to the musical score. Most of all, the movie aimed to be creepy the majority of the time with atmosphere and mood instead of in-your-face shocks. <br/><br/>Though I liked the movie for those things I mentioned above, I have to admit that I don't think all horror fans will go for it. It's a quite slow-moving movie, which may frustrate horror fans who are prepared for roller coaster speed thrills. Also, there is precious little in the way of special effects and bloody horror elements, which may disappoint people prepared for spectacle. (Most of the movie's special effects and blood come in the climax.) And I will admit that the story has some confusing and/or unexplained elements, though fortunately they are minor plot details. So I really think your possible enjoyment (or possible dislike) of the movie is a matter of taste... as well as with what particular mood you are in at the time."

"Reno-Rangan","8","3","10","4 November 2015"," An innovative horror-drama with a simplicity.
","It was not too long ago I saw the director's other film, his first one and liked it instantly. I did not expect him to go all the way from a beautiful teen drama to a creepy horror flick. But I liked this movie as well, thus that prove he's not a fluke. After seeing his both the films, I can detect the style of presentation that marks his trademark. That is very realistic, dull, but a natural societal atmosphere with a mere background score.<br/><br/>I have said many times that these days horror flicks are heavily leaning on the scary noise/sounds. But this film brings the tone that's really happening around us. The story was like a straight flowing river, no twists or turns like the Amazon river. Even it did not try to hide the existence of the evil spirit. Not only from us, but among the characters in the story. That means it is a very simple tale with the compelling scenes.<br/><br/>It does not look like a cheap horror, this 2 million movie can stand up to any fancy horror flicks. The writer/director's interpretation was very interesting too. Like he said IT could board a plane to follow who he's after. The theme was also very innovative. Quite similar types have made out, but this one was way better. Yep, many movie goers overwhelmed by the unexpected, even the filmmakers for the response.<br/><br/>Now I pray for if there is going to be a sequel, it must be made by the same writer/director. My worry is the B category filmmakers going to spoil the original in the name of follow-up. I highly recommend this movie, especially for adults due to the plot that develops on the sexual intercourse. Though there's no strong nudity. I also suggest you to watch at night, if possible alone. I won't guarantee that it would scare out of you, but that's the best way to watch any horror flick.<br/><br/>8/10"
"john-g-mckay","8","3","10","30 October 2015"," Terrific, original vision with near-flawless execution
","I was inspired to write my own review of this film after sifting through pages of critiques from people who expect some ADD-friendly, big-budget hack job with MTV-style editing and jump scares. <br/><br/>If you're going into this movie expecting that, of course you're going to be disappointed. Those types of movies are played out and aren't frightening at all. This film gave me the worst feeling of dread since watching the first Halloween movie. And you know what made that movie great and the remakes so inferior? We barely know who or what ""IT"" is. Modern horror films and remakes/sequels try to analyze what makes the scary person or thing tick. But the unknown is always scarier than the known. We don't need a back story. We can't expect the characters to know the origin of ""it."" <br/><br/>""It"" in this story is a curse of some sort -- I won't spoil it -- but the primary victim in this story didn't ask to be infected with this curse and only gets a cursory explanation from her sexual partner (at least there's that) before she is left to deal with it herself. Not knowing who ""it"" is, what ""it"" looks like or why it's following you is absolutely horrifying. <br/><br/>Anyway, this film offers tense, atmospheric horror without cheap scares. The suburban Detroit location adds a creepy backdrop. The minimalist Casio score adds to the sparse feel. This is a horrifying premise and the delivery is nearly flawless. As Quentin Tarantino has noted, the filmmaker breaks some of his own rules throughout the film and that is a minor issue, but it doesn't take away from the experience. This is easily one of the top five horror films of the past 25 years."
"nukfan","7","3","10","24 October 2015"," Exposes you through fear; the tension is key.
","For years, I've been waiting for a movie that properly exploits my nightmares. Horror movies in general are a tough sell for me. I find them to be fairly predictable, ridden with clichés and not remotely subtle. The threat never has any mystique, and the implications are underwhelming.<br/><br/>""It Follows"" manages, particularly for the first hour, to tap into some kind of primal fear that I had long forgotten or at least rarely dealt with. Something needs to be said for the cinematography; it's always ominous, and every scene is laced with a darkness that reminds you never to forget about the threat.<br/><br/>Imagine you're being followed by something. Something capable of dealing tremendous pain and suffering through uncertain methods. It always moves at a walking pace, but it is always moving. When you're asleep, it gains ground on you. When you're standing still, its eyes are doing their best to bore into your very soul. It never loses focus. When you see it, it's unequivocally staring right back at you, slowing gaining ground. The eyes are technically human, but there is an uncanny nature to them. It wants to get you through physical means.<br/><br/>It's really not enough to describe this kind of tension, but that's probably the best way for me to sum it up. The music during these scenes is flawless and it plays a kind of role of its own. There were times during the first hour when the tension was wholly unbearable. It made me feel vulnerable and cold.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film loses steam in the final act. The horrific mystique of the first hour fades into a kind of peculiar mystery, and I think the ending contradicts the nature of the film as a whole; I didn't want to see a final showdown, I wanted to see how long the filmmakers could string out the tension.<br/><br/>I recommend watching this alone and in the dark. This is a must-see film that corrupts your sense of security and brings back the nightmares you abandoned long ago."

","It Follows could be viewed as a metaphor of sexually transmitted diseases, or one could take a more literal approach to the film; either way, the concept is new, refreshing and above all, good. It Follows is apart of a small band of horror films that, in modern times, is very good, very engaging and very entertaining. You would be hard pressed to find a better horror film that doesn't rely on the typical clichés of the genre. However, if criticism prevails, It Follows fails in the scares department. The film is pretty lack luster in the whole scary mood, but that doesn't mean it's terrible, in fact, it's hard to see this movie being scary without resulting to clichés and cheap jump scares. <br/><br/>A very good job to the creators of this film. It's original, it's probably the funniest film I've watched in a while and it produces a decent wave for other films to follow in its footsteps. A true gem in the rough."
"elgabote","8","3","10","10 August 2015"," Great atmospheric movie
","I would have given this movie a better score if it wasn't for a few things in the last half hour that made me love this movie just a little bit less. The atmospheric slow paced photography was something I noticed and loved straight away, a bit retro-indie style that gave a lot of tension. The actors are great, and the characters are well written, even if there's no much introduction to them they feel real and well connected, and the script lets you know things about them and their relationships with just little details that say a lot. The music added up a lot of atmosphere too, also in a retro 80's style that suits everything else very well. Even the set up is retro, there's no cellphones or LCD screens (how refreshing it feels!) or new technologies of any kind. What I really liked beside the interesting premise was the characters, that were not the typical moronic teenagers from latest horror movies, but felt more realistic and believable. I didn't like a scene in the end, where unfortunately they started doing silly things (don't want to spoil it) but wasn't that bad to make me not like the whole thing. The ending was (NO SPOILER) a bit too open maybe, but can't say it's a bad one... Maybe people will want explanations about everything, but I rather in this kind of movie the suspense of not knowing the why... Great photography and acting. Very good story, design and sound. Great horror film, watch it at night, in the dark and in silence."

","The movie was quite nice and it contained a lot of twists and spooky moments that would surprise you as most of the horror movies do. However, the events seem to accelerate and some scenes should have been added. By the end of the movie we would still ask the question: what was it? <br/><br/>Also,as the characters didn't get the answer of ""why"", the reader is also waiting the cause of this thing that doesn't give up.<br/><br/>The plethora of horror movies and with their relative similarity makes it a challenge to come with a disruptive plot that would change that pattern of our deeper fears and thoughts. the frames and scenes try to simulate a the psychotic environment of people who are under some psychological problems that even prevent them from sleeping. Scientists said that if we don't sleep for more than 60 hours, we start to hear sounds. The movie made me wonder whether what we see is what we always get since our imperfect minds may create deceptive illusion that we would believe easily and we would find it hard to dispose of."

","It Follows is one of the rare horror films with a great concept. As the film went on I expected that we would eventually delve into the mystery about who or what the ""Follower"" was and how it all began. But the film doesn't do that and as it nears the end you realize that's not important. You don't need to be told, you already know. What follows is sin, karma or whatever word you want to choose. It is our human failure personified from which you can try to run but it always catches up.<br/><br/>The film has a beautiful simplicity. It's horror comes from such common things like footsteps slowly advancing, knocks on the door, people approaching as you wait in fear that they might be after you. Since regular cinema so rarely manages to capture the world of mental illness it is left to horror movies to show the fear and trauma that can be part of everyday life. Just the damage that you can't escape.<br/><br/>The characters actually feel like real people, a crucial thing for any horror film. The main actress does a great job of portraying a person living in utter terror. Overall there is lots to recommend about this film, but it is, sadly, not without flaws. Parts of it feel slow and needlessly drawn out. Then there is some silliness towards the end when they try to fight the thing. Generally things are less scary when there is a group of people rather than just one individual against the killer/monster. <br/><br/>Basically, while it is still miles above the average jump-scare flick, with such potential the film could have been a lot better and it never managed to achieve those heights."

","3.5 of 10. Very impressive suburban imagery and capturing of the suburban atmosphere that could make for a successful teen film in and of itself. Unfortunately, the idea - that there's this thing you can only get rid of by giving it to someone else who must give it to someone else ad infinitum - makes for a horrible metaphor for the setting, characters, and plot. This idea shouldn't be the base of a horror film, but a more intellectual drama/thriller that involves a financial pyramid scam.<br/><br/>As it is, we there's gore and graphic imagery to keep the simple-minded entertained but no follow-through to make the story believable. That makes it just another empty horror story.<br/><br/>The characters/acting and atmosphere/style keep if from being a complete failure, but not enough to make it worth following.

","I have seen all of the great reviews, high viewer ratings and I do not get it. As one lady said on the way out "" we should have seen the Disney movie"". It started off slow and got stupid. It brought to mind Richard Pryor's routine about White people and horror movies. Any horror movie has to set up it's ""world"" but this one is internally inconsistent. The beginning could have been left off since it didn't add anything to the plot. I understand now the point was to make fun of certain horror films. I didn't get it at the time. It could have been a very good psychological thriller. The only interesting point was the Alpha male vs. Beta male starting about half way through the movie. If they had developed it more it would have been much more interesting. I don't get all of the full frontal nudity of the monsters. It didn't add anything at all to the movie. I will admit the acting was good but the characters were uninteresting. A previous reviewer said either you like it or you hate it. I would have to agree with that."
"yuwei-lin","3","21","132","14 March 2015"," Undermining female role and a textbook horror film
","The idea of turning the sexual struggles with adolescence and exploration of sex into a horror film is interesting. The director also intends to show our fear of malformed / different bodies, unlike the Hollywood standard, young and slim bodies. These unusual bodies, appeared in different ages and sexes, dressed or naked, are portrayed as 'others'. <br/><br/>In addition to appearance and beauty, teens also struggle with defining their own sexuality and sexual relationships. The director seems experimental with crossovers of 'male gaze' and camera's movement and angles for horror films. For example, the look of the teen boys lingers on the female teens body is accompanied by horror music scores in the background to create an uncertainty. <br/><br/>However, there is a perceivable dissonance in this title; at times it feels such crossovers / blending of sexual and teen movie elements do not go well with horror elements. It feels like a student film following textbook guidance of making a horror film. It is not difficult for the audience to guess that something is going to happen. The music is also a bit monotonous. <br/><br/>Besides, the director is conservative in making the female character stronger and balance the power between teen boys and girls. For example, females are again victimized in the title, and with males being the brave ones - no matter in which ways. <br/><br/>There are also other problems e.g., poor performance. <br/><br/>I'm afraid it deserves a low score."

","This movie does have an awful lot of hype around it, the only way to enjoy this movie is don't jump in thinking its going to be a masterpiece, its not but it still is a fantastic movie for many reasons, its certainly very original, the story is basically about a girl who is currently dating a guy, they go out one night and have sex in the back of his car, he tells her he has passed something to her, something that will follow her, the only way to survive is to pass it to another person, then the terror begins!! you need to go into this movie with a very good imagination, I think most people only rate this low because they don't get it, the movie does leave many things open to explanation which is good, you have to fill in the blanks which makes it more fun, the movie has a good pace and gets more and more tense as it unfolds, the movie is directed really well with some nice quiet suburban locations, its certainly good at the scares and the feeling of sheer dread when the followers are on screen, the movie is very grounded and has little use for cheesy effects which is great, the cast is talented, all the female leads are great young actresses, the movies main star for me is the awesome music score by composer disasterpeace, the music really helps give such a feeling of fear, much like John Carpenters theme did for Halloween, the movie like people have said feels like a long middle, you don't get an explanation of where the supernatural element comes from and the ending is left very open to explanation too but you just have to use your imagination, the movie is certainly worth checking out if your a horror fan, its really well made, its not amazing so don't hype yourself up, its clever and original at least and will probably certainly be a future classic indeed"

"hybridconcience","3","19","121","29 March 2015"," Please save your money. -SPOILER WARNING-
","I am no contemporary horror fan. Clearly this is the case. I say this because of all the smashing reviews this movie has received. I like many were excited at the premise that the trailer for this movie portrayed. So like hungry consumer monkeys we shelled out hours of our life earning the money to watch this movie as well as wasting the time to watch it. Now we will begin with the tale of how it most definitely sucked. For those of you with some image in your mind that this movie was in any way revolutionary are quite absurd. I say this because this movie begins with the same original recipe for teen horror movie trope. Attractive girl runs from yet unseen assailant and the camera pans drifting about the street centering said girl. It continues to follow all the said normal articles for what is considered a suspense horror and does so poorly. Basic jump scares and suspenseful music to make up for the lack of character development and much needed explanation for the world that these people were living in. Let us begin with the tale of the magic compact kindle. Friend number 2 whose name I cannot even remember even though seeing this movie last night(great character development)throughout the process of the movie read from a pink seashell compact. I'm sure the director was hoping that she somehow would breathe some sort of amazing performance from cryptic poetry she was reading that covered the inevitable destiny known as death. This like many other things fell short, but this is not what i truly have a problem with. In the setting the attire,hairstyles,and vehicles were very akin to the era of the 1970s. The televisions and radio announcers as well as the countless electronics thrown into the pool in that oh so anti climactic scene were all seemingly items from the 50s. Then we have out touch screen compact reading device that stands out like a sore thumb in the middle of all this period architecture and technology. Like the friggin phones attached to walls...in houses. This more than anything really bothered me about this movie. Because no real judgment could be made to as when these things occurred. The characters lacked development and were one dimensional throughout. I could go on for many many many many more paragraphs about how much this movie was exactly what horror does not need. Let me just save you the trouble of wasting more time reading this rant that something purely horrible spawned and tell you to please....save your money."
"basilisksamuk","6","6","28","3 March 2015"," Good but not that good
","Peter Bradshaw, Danny Leigh and Claudia Winkleman are all critics whose judgements I trust and they all raved about how good this film was. As a result I was really expecting something out of the ordinary when I went to see it. However I have to say that I came out of the cinema somewhat disappointed. It's not that It Follows is a terrible film. It's actually good but it's not good enough to merit the five and ten star reviews (depending on the system used) that it's received. It's the sort of film that deserves to be discovered as a minor cult film several years after its release. <br/><br/>I'm also puzzled by the fact so many reviewers have said it's one of the few films that they have found genuinely frightening. I wanted to be scared, I really did, but all I experienced was a minor frisson. Several things mitigated against this film working for me. There's a lot of shaky cam and it doesn't work in all films. Sometimes it does work in favour of It Follows but there are several 360 degree pans which are so out of focus as to take you out of the film. Blurring can work quite well in horror but here it would have been more effective to be in focus more often. It's the same story with the music, an electronic soundtrack that sometimes works well but at other times is just plain annoying and distracting.<br/><br/>Homage is paid to several other films and often to the detriment of It Follows. There's a very clear reference to Halloween in the setting and the music. There's a pivotal scene set in a swimming pool at night which puts you in mind of Let the Right One In. This, above all, lets the film down. Where the pool scene in Let the Right One In is dazzlingly disorienting and genuinely frightening, the one we get here is rather pedestrian both in concept and execution.<br/><br/>It's a pity this film has got such good reviews because it deserves to be seen as a minor horror that tries for something different and often achieves it. A more modest reception is what it really deserves. The way it plays with time so that you can never be sure when it's supposed to be set is quite brilliant and really adds to the unsettling atmosphere throughout. Often the look and feel of the film reminded me of David Lynch and I spent a lot of my time wishing Lynch had been the director because I'm sure he could make something really frightening of this material.<br/><br/>A good film and worth seeing but my advice is to lower your expectations if you've been reading the better reviews it has been given."
"Rageypoo","6","4","16","5 June 2015"," Started off incredibly strong, then...
","It is incredibly tough to rate this movie. The actors were mostly fresh faces, and the cinematography was really really good, aside from that...the story <br/><br/>****Spoilers ahead****<br/><br/>The movie starts off strongly where the audience has no clue what ""it"" is. It seems to change into different characters depending on...well we're not sure. the first guy who had it said it can change into people that you love just to hurt you, but it never changed into anything that the main protagonist loved, just random people (or people-like things) with the exception of the neighbor, but it didn't seem like she loved him, or anyone in particular. In fact we don't know anything about her other than she's a kid that is old enough to date. <br/><br/>the story tries to sum up things about the area later in the movie (like we're not quite sure where this film takes place, but they hinted that it was somewhere possibly in Detroit, referencing 8 mile) which has pretty much no relevance once it's talked about. For whatever reason no one else can see ""it"" unless you have sex with that person, making it more like a sin that comes for you or a manifestation of a std rather than an actual haunting. For whatever reason it can be shot and it bleeds, but doesn't affect it in the least. The girl is told not to let it touch you, but it touches her twice through the film, with seemingly little consequence. In fact the movie has very little consequence of any kind, the parents are absent from the movie, but the kids have full access to their homes and vehicles. The beginning of the movie was electrifying and horrifying but slowly dies off near the end. This movie would have done better as a series, similar to Halloween. <br/><br/>Then there's the house that the first guy rented. It set up traps so he could protect himself from ""it"" because he was genuinely scared of it, as he should be. This bothered me since the girl never used the same tactics or even take the same precautions. In fact the only reason he went on the date was so he could pass it along. When the girl gets it however, she only shows real fear of it whenever it is around, and no other time. Heck even the family is so laid back about it, why should the audience be afraid of it at all? Her siblings seemed like they could care less about what it was. <br/><br/>Plot aside, I thought the jump scares were a nice touch. Usually movies are riddled with ridiculous jump scares at all the wrong times, this movie did a VERY good job with them. I think if they would have had a tighter structure for the story and plot line and even used less effects, this movie would have been a refreshing addition to the horror genre. If you are into feeling a sense of scare, the first part of the movie will definitely do it for you. 6.5 out of 10 for me."

Not to mention the whole dimension of what is implied (that is only hinted at, which you either relish or hate).<br/><br/>Acting is really good and the mood gets transported in an old school way of horror. We might see the beginning of an ""IT"" or Scream Girl/Queen. Although she doesn't scream that much in her other movie (The Guest, a weird and good mix of genres), she has a lot to fear here.

However, I didn't care a single ounce for the characters, I found myself getting more and more bored as the plot felt like it was going nowhere and had no clue what it was doing and, after the first 15 minutes, all potential for scares were lost for me due to its repetitive and lost-feeling story.<br/><br/>There were elements that worked and a lot that weren't working for me with ""It Follows"" and it ultimately made me feel like this film is all hype with no real substance."

The characters in this movie don't behave like idiots at all.<br/><br/>From the scoring to the pace of the menace it is rich with homage to Carpenter's Halloween, it also owes much of it's style and theme to movies like Jacob's Ladder, The Happening, Susperia and The Entity but it doesn't rip any of these movies off. <br/><br/>It also is an allegory which is refreshing because while I enjoy a slasher flick as much as anyone, rarely do even supernatural horror films address the human situation in any real way, beyond the occasional theological reference of holy vs unholy or sane vs insane. They even slip in some social commentary in a way that seems natural.<br/><br/>It follows makes my top 10 list of horror movies made since the new century and maybe since 1990. Which is saying a great deal considering the sad state of cinema these days."

","I may be lacking when it comes to the amount of horrors movies I've seen, but I know when I see a good one. Of the horror movies I've seen, John Carpenter's original Halloween ranks as one of my favorites. I say this because there are some moments of It Follows that are clearly an homage to Carpenter's film.<br/><br/>The premise is simple, after having her first sexual encounter, Jay (Maika Monroe) encounters a supernatural being, It, who is constantly following her. That's basically it (No Pun intended). It's a simple idea that once pondered becomes more and more intriguing when thinking about the possibilities of directions the movie could have gone. I believe that the director took the followed the best path for this film and it allowed the film to not only be chillingly haunting, but thought-provoking.<br/><br/>To continue, the biggest surprise of the film for me was the acting. I was surprised to feel that the reactions felt by the main character and her friends were genuine and it made me share their fear.<br/><br/>I'll keep this short. While there is a little fat on this relatively short movie that could be trimmed, It Follows still stands out and hopefully marks a much needed comeback of great horror movies to modern cinema.<br/><br/>""It is always following you."""

","Good film , premise is that a girl gets ""infected from sex . The infection is that a demon will follow her and kill her unless she passes it onto someone else sex.its a very good looking film , the camera work is so sharp. Acting is good and allure characters are solid. Soundtrack is very eighties drive type synths, nice touch and well crafted music. For me the first half of the film was the best part, second half dipped a bit , but it was OK. I can't call it a classic , but it's better than your final destination type horror. I did get chills all over me in several parts of the film and that was done via good pacing and then adding the creepy chilling elements. I read some of the other reviews and felt they are way to harsh on this film. It's a solid horror film . No gore, just a solid story , solid script , great camera filming and acting. The story is good , but not superb , I think that what they did with the limited story was first class, you can tell that all elements of this film tried their hardest , from acting , soundtrack and filming. The story was good but let it down because it just dipped half way through , still worth watching for anyone who wants to be scared for a couple of hours. I would recommend this."

","Going in, I was really skeptical of this movie because of the plot. Someone had explained it to me, and it really just sounded like the kind of ghost stories I found the most boring. The super natural sexual killer. This movie manages to find the potential in those kind of stories, and conveys it brilliantly.<br/><br/>I'll focus on the aspect on the movie that I liked the most. Because of the situation depicted, where one never knows what appearance It will have, and only knows that it will be walking slowly towards you, this movie has you constantly looking at the background. This is a brilliant move, as it helps keeping you on the edge of your seat. But it also requires the movie to have interesting visuals, because looking at the background and being annoyed by it would make the movie worse. By accomplishing both having the audience looking at the backgrounds, and also have the audience enjoy the visuals of the movie, the movie makers has really done a good job.<br/><br/>What I did not like: How it's out of question to contact someone who might research/experiment on It. It's easy enough to find a big, open area, and have a car ready to escape. But as in all horror movies, you have to allow the characters to make some decisions you disagree with."

"bkrauser-81-311064","8","2","6","24 June 2016"," It Is Great
","The first thing you notice about the world created by It Follows is its chilling sense of timelessness. Characters watch old black and white films on cathode tube television sets, drive old Plymouths and read Dostoyevsky off of clamshell e-readers. No one owns a cellphone yet everyone wears jeans; their are fallen leaves on the ground, yet the kids make a day at the beach. Nothing makes sense.<br/><br/>The ""It"" in It Follows is a ghostly entity that's glacially paces towards its victim in a never stopping march; taking the shape of random people to trick its prey. The young Jay (Monroe) is only the latest target of the entity, receiving it from her latest date, the resident bad boy Hugh (Weary). Only those who were stalked by the entity can see it and the only way to get rid of it is to simply pass it along through sexual intercourse. Jay's only allies are her friends Paul (Gilchrist), Greg (Zovatto) and Yara (Luccardi) and sister Kelly (Sepe) all of which can't see the demon but to varying degrees start to believe she can see something the others can't.<br/><br/>With a cursory glance of It Follows many (and have) written off the film's demon as a representation of STIs. The promotional campaign for the film even sells it as a sleazy retro throwback to the Halloween (1978) era. Yet beneath the coy insinuations and remarkably modest displays of teenage sexuality, the film seems to be belaying a deeper message that goes beyond horror movie archetypes and backseat nooky. Could the demon perhaps represent something much larger and infinitely scarier?<br/><br/>The denizens of the film seem to be a lost generation of unsure and interminably bored youths. Apart from a few brief moments, no adult seems to be guiding our protagonists in any meaningful way. Hugh at one point longs to ""trade places"" with a five-year-old whose waddling along in front of doting parents. ""He's got his entire life ahead of him,"" he says bleakly. Through the subjective lens of Jay, her sexual awakening is akin to experiencing this regret; a burden passed on to her by an older man that may just ruin her life.<br/><br/>The horror of It Follows horror is not provided by schlocky gore or cheap scare tactics but brought to the surface by an impending doom. The loss of innocence felt by nearly all the characters forces them to think critically about the problem of the monster which can come at anytime and in any form. This nebulous idea has allowed many to mark the monster as a symbol for everything from STIs, corruption, depleting resources, addiction, corruption to even fiscal irresponsibility. The demon will follow you and follow you until you pass it on or die from it.<br/><br/>Speaking of fiscal irresponsibility; the entirety of the film is shot in the State of Michigan on the outskirts of Detroit. To instill a sense of gloom and doom, nearly all the homes are eerily empty bungalows and all other structures reek of industrial decay. Even the idyllic cabin by the lake where the teens escape has a faded quality that heightens the sense that the characters are lost in an ever crumbling nightmare. It's a world of a hundred indecisions and squandered opportunities and as a former resident of the Mitten State, I immediately responded to the mis en scene.<br/><br/>It Follows is a superb horror film whose nebulous ambiguity may frustrate those not attune to director David Robert Mitchell's peculiar machinations. It's a waking dream of ruin, decay and the broken promises of youth. Even if you go in insisting the film is about a walking, zombified STI, you'll still find lot to like. The beauty of It Follows is it's like an inkblot test for horror aficionados and popular audiences; it only gives answers to those who seek them."
"kmikzero","7","2","6","24 June 2016"," It's actually not so bad

","Horror movies are a dime a dozen. Great horror movies are not. What used to be great isn't great anymore because its old hat. This movie is an original idea that doesn't really follow any of the horror rules that have been set in place over the last 3 or 4 decades. I'm not saying this is the best horror movie ever, but I appreciate the originality of what they did here. The atmosphere created by the acting and the music really helped this movie hit its mark. There is a creepy vibe given off at times that suck you in and then nothing happens. Then the opposite happens. The killer(s), now there's a great idea. This is a fight that you just can't win. You can't run, you can't really hide, you can't fight it or use weapons to destroy it/them. And the form the killer takes can be someone you know or love, someone you've seen before or just some random person walking down the street. Only the person targeted can see the killer, but you will learn that others can see the effects of what happens when one gets its hands on the followed. But the idea that it is sexually transmitted is awesome. If you read that in a description you may automatically think its a comedy or that the idea is ridiculous. Well, it just works. The idea just works. You don't even think it to be ridiculous once the movie gets going and you see the first victim in the movie. She is just messed up. So any potential for laughs is scrubbed clean by the visual of the first dead girl. Well done horror. I'm a new fan of this movie."
"Deigues","9","2","6","26 February 2016"," One of the most unique horror films in recent years
","A terrific concept and a flawless execution solidify ""It Follows"" as one of the best horror films in years.<br/><br/>The film follows Jay (no pun intended), a girl who after having intercourse with a guy she'd been dating starts being followed by an unknown entity. Jay quickly aligns herself with her friends and together they try to make sense of what exactly ""It"" is. The group finds out that ""It"" can take the shape of anyone it pleases and will follow Jay and kill her unless she has sex with someone else and passes the ""curse"" onto them. The premise isn't hard to grasp and the film does a fine job of getting the specifics out of the way quickly.<br/><br/>David Robert Mitchell stages ""It Follows"" carefully and shoots it methodically. He often frames his characters in wide shots and continuously uses pans to engulf them in their surrounding world. But what world is this? Adults are strangely scarce. ""It Follows"" mainly encompasses teenagers who seem somehow adrift in their life, none of them really knowing what to do. Many have stated the premise is a metaphor for STD's, although continuously having sex with others wouldn't diminish your chance of dying.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the film, a 21 year old states that he would like to be a little boy of 6 again, so that he would have ""his whole life ahead of him"". Maybe that's what it's about, teenage angst; having to leave the safeguard of childhood and embrace the inherent challenges of adulthood. These characters spend their time running from something they simply cannot run far enough away from. Sex is widely seen as an act of transition into adulthood and they struggle between escape and embrace. They're defiant but afraid of what the future will bring. They can try and ignore their maturity, but with each passing day, it's closer and one day they'll have to do something about it. They'll have to accept certain responsibilities and maybe confront old fears they had buried so deep, they thought they would never have to face.<br/><br/>Of course this is my take on it. You might not agree and it might not be yours. We can disagree on that, but hopefully we'll agree on this: ""It Follows"" is unique. It's unique and frightening as very few recent films have been."
"johnplocar","9","2","6","16 February 2016"," This was a damn good horror film...
","In a time where that is so depressingly rare to say ""I just saw a great horror movie"", I am so glad that I finally got a chance to see it. I will go into the plot, but I must press that it is on the ridiculous side in terms of the concept of what this film is about. If you like horror movies like ""Christine"" or ""The Entity"" that have a ridiculous concept, but it is done so well in its writing and direction then this is a movie for you. The movie is about a girl who is haunted by a ghost after having sex. Yes. That's right. Now before you stop reading, I know that it sounds like it is a ridiculously stupid concept for a movie that only exists so that there can be more of a reason why there's nudity in a horror movie. Not the case at all. There is some nudity in the flick but honestly not a whole lot, the majority of any nudity to be found is usually by the ghost itself and it's not even close to being sexy, it's seriously creepy and disturbing. Like I said before, this is a movie that if written or directed by anyone else this would have been pretty bad. Like with ""Christine"" being about a killer car or ""The Entity"" being about a sexually assaulting ghost, those could have been done so horribly wrong if done by anyone else; in capable hands however they became something really eerie and haunting. <br/><br/>In the movie the girl is tricked into having sex with a guy and so he ties her up and explains to her what the ghost does and how it works as far as he knows. The ghost goes after one person; if that person has sex with another then it moves onto them until the ghost kills them. Then the ghost goes back to the person prior and then the one before them and so on and so forth. The ghost can only be seen by the people who have sexually interacted with the ""infected"", the ghost only walks but it never stops. It keeps going and going until it reaches their target and practically massacres them. It can change into anyone; whether it is a stranger or someone they love just to get closer. There is no explanation as to why the ghost is doing this, how it all started, who started it, and it is completely unneeded to enjoy this movie. The pacing, the mood, the direction, the cinematography, the characters, the scares, the ghost all work so well and so disturbing that receiving some sort of explanation only would have impeded on the enjoyment to be had. It is creepy just watching this poor girl try to figure out how to get away from this thing. The girl, played by Maika Monroe, does so well in this role. If played wrong this could have been some annoying blonde ditz that I'm begging to get axed off but instead I am immediately stricken with such sympathy for her and this awful thing that she is forced to go through...all because she liked a boy. It's actually kind of heart breaking and even sadder as I think more about it actually. <br/><br/>But anyways, in a lesser written film too she could have been an irredeemable character and just went straight to trying to pass it on to someone else but instead she tries to run or kill it or anything really before she thinks about doing something like that. There isn't a bad character in this whole movie, they are all pretty likable and I definitely like that even the skeptic in this movie (that can be found in most horror movies) still is sympathetic and is actually trying to help instead of mess things up or do something stupid like most usually do. And I cannot get over the awesome cinematography in this film, it is so well shot and I was blown away. Anyone else who sees this film will probably say, ""What makes the cinematography so good?"" Please just pay attention to the lighting at the very least. In any other horror movie, even ones that I've liked over the past few years, would be so darkly lit that it is anyone's guess as so what is going on. This movie does not care about realism in that regard, if it is going to put a spot light over a car that makes absolute, zero sense to have any light shining over the car then dammit that is what's going to happen. <br/><br/>Also the framing of some of the wide, isolated shots were reminding me of something out of ""The Shining"" and the camera work screamed Wes Craven more than once. Seriously this is a real good horror film, see it if you can. Do you know how rare that is now? Guess how many good horror films I saw last year...like freaking three. So far we're already halfway through this year and I've only seen one legitimately good horror film. Just this one. I want more like this!"
"Tehmeh","7","2","6","18 November 2015"," Once you get over the horrible premise, it's quite good.
","Small non-gore, non-Hollywood horror films are something I like to take a chance with every now and then, since Hollywood can only spout out crap when it comes to this genre; jumpscares and uninventive PG-13 formula movies galore - all of things that I despise with a passion. So I bought the blu-ray after having heard good things about ""It Follows"".<br/><br/>""It Follows"" is definitely not a masterpiece like so many claim. Let's not call everything ""a masterpiece"" just because it isn't crap like so many other seemingly similar movies. It offers something fresh and real, but still fails to differentiate itself enough from the clichÃ©-ridden horror tropes that bore and anger me to tears. It's easily better than average Hollywood mainstream horror though, that much is certain.<br/><br/>So let's get into it. The plot, or premise, for this movie is horrible. I do like the simple idea of being followed, but I can't take the reason for it seriously. ""The Ring"" came to mind. Not because of similarity in story elements (well, perhaps some) but because both movies give you something very stupid and ask you to believe it in order to enjoy the rest of the movie. I won't spoil it, but I had a hard time with it. Eventually, just like with ""The Ring"", I managed. Luckily this time even the movie itself didn't want to dwell on the reasons or origins of the phenomena it presented us, and instead just went with it. Props for that.<br/><br/>After we have been informed about the laughable main plot, and once we have gotten over it, ""It Follows"" shows its claws. Things happen in somewhat believable manner (if you excuse the ""no parents"" or ""where did they change their clothes"" kind of stuff and a few other stupidities for the sake of a tighter story) or at least the actors/director make it seem like it. When something seems off, another thing comes along to pull us back to the movie. If you're not easily immersed, this might not be the movie for you. It's a simple movie that doesn't hold up in scrutiny. It's all about being in the present and trying to keep you in the moment - and this is handled well.<br/><br/>We get no one-liners, no awful expository dialogue just for the sake of it, no senseless side events to distract us from what's happening, no teen slang attempts to make you rage. Because of how tight and straight everything was handled, I actually got scared every now and then. Some nice tricks are used well and creatively, and the pressing atmosphere is there almost all the time. That atmosphere and several well-handled creepy bits are indeed something that I've been waiting and missing from horror movies lately.<br/><br/>...But just when you think you're watching a real gem, you count your third jumpscare or witness some of the messy writing, especially during the bigger ending scene. It's almost a shame that a movie like this uses jumpscares, when there is plenty of atmosphere already. It's not all over the place and this movie certainly isn't built around them, but the fact they used them - often for no purpose and without earning them beforehand - grinds my gears. <br/><br/>The main story has a final act that seems forced, especially the last ""action"" scene. It seems to be there just because so many other movies and stories did it. At this point, we realize we are watching a movie that couldn't ride all the way with its fresh approach. Perhaps the approach and the gimmicks came first, and the script came last.<br/><br/>""It follows"" is pretty well shot. Shots are framed and lit nicely, and while sometimes the quality of equipment (or the quality of blu-ray, not sure) shows, the movie looks good in general. I might have noticed some CGI in couple of shots, but those were probably the only shots with CGI in the whole film. This is a good thing, and I must say that many practical ""tricks"" were handled with style.<br/><br/>The music was hit or miss, most of the time miss. There were a few bits when it managed to complement the scene or the movie itself, other times it made my ears bleed. I want to be immersed, not annoyed. I like the idea of using synths in general though, and at least they tried something different. Many have mentioned getting a John Carpenter-vibe out of it, even if I didn't.<br/><br/>Actors did a fine job. Maika Monroe, Geir Gilchrist and Jake Weary were good. There were other characters with no real purpose, I guess the actors were alright for those parts too, but the characters themselves stood out as glorified extras. Not that you can't have them, but you could see where a few ""let's have something happen to that one, or let's give that one something to do"" thoughts got the best of writer/director David Robert Mitchell. The results were clunky, annoying or pretentious (one side character gets to read a ""deep"" quote from a book). Anyway, the actors were fine. Thumbs up for some of the ""creatures"" and the actors portraying them too. At their best, they were excellent. They had small roles but very important ones.<br/><br/>I will now compare this movie to many Stephen King books; Good, atmospheric and gripping piece of entertainment that falls flat at some points along the way, not knowing or daring what it wanted to do. I do recommend it though. I bickered a lot about this movie, but only because it could have been so much better. The potential was there.<br/><br/>""It Follows"" is better than most horror movies nowadays, and I don't regret purchasing the blu-ray. Just don't expect a masterpiece and you might be rewarded. Go check it out."
"Suicide_Saint","7","2","6","21 July 2015"," Do Not Watch the Trailer!
","Somehow, nearly every important scene from this film was crammed into the two and a half minute long trailer. I am a lifelong horror fan, though the genre has produced more garbage than good, and was really looking forward to an original idea. I was intrigued when I first read about the project, excited when I heard some of the soundtrack, and ecstatic when I saw the trailer. Sadly, that was a mistake. As I watched in anticipation, each scene's suspense was undermined by the fact that the trailer had given away precisely what would happen. 10-15 minutes of build-up, then something from the trailer... Another 10-15 minutes of build-up, then another shot from the trailer.<br/><br/>The STD (sexually transmitted demon - I'm sure someone else has made that joke, but I couldn't read through every review) was ultimately a somewhat laughable idea for a film. The acting was decent, the directing / camera angles, and cinematography was fine, the suspense would have been great if not for the trailer, and the overall story / execution was also acceptable. The only thing that blows me away about this film however (other than the seemingly unwarranted critical praise) is the soundtrack. MAJOR props to Disasterpeace for a frightening soundscape.<br/><br/>I really, honestly feel that I would have enjoyed this movie so much more if it were not for the trailer revealing so much. Note to self: never watch a movie trailer again. The last horror film I truly enjoyed was ""A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night"" and coincidentally, I knew nothing about the film beforehand. I simply put it on & enjoyed it. That's the way to watch movies anymore, I suppose."

The only way to rid himself of this force is to let it kill him, or to have sex with someone, thereby passing the curse along to them. The latter is his choice and we meet Jay, an odd (to me) young lady that goes out on a date with this guy. They end up having sex and he shows her ""it"". Jay is at first traumatized because she feel violated, he knocks her out and ties her up to prove ""it"" is real. She soon realizes that ""it"" is real and the chase is on.

I guess, when you really think about it, most horror movies don't really make much sense, it's just particularly obvious in this case. I agree with other viewers who thought it had a kind of cool '80s vibe, but that's about the best I can say about it. In the end, there was no way that I was going to sit through the whole thing, so I fast-forwarded here and there to see if it got any better, but it didn't. I'm not a big horror fan anyhow, and I guess that this is comparatively original plot to most, but it just gets slower and dumber as it goes along, with a few interesting subtexts."

","Alright, I've actually never written a review before but I got really pissed off by the ratings. I literally can't believe how stupid this movie is and why it is rated so high. The script is awful, the direction is mediocre and I am not getting into the acting because I respect their effort since they're still young, but did they really try to begin with? People, if you have a brain that works and you watch a movie that you don't get, it is probably because there is nothing to get. STOP TRYING TO MAKE EVERYTHING INTO A CLASSIC! This film is not a, so called by many, ""gem"" and it will never become one. And to the person that said it reminded him of ""The Shining""(!!!), please go see a doctor before it's too late..

I guess it was supposed to be an homage to the slasher pics of the 70's and 80's, so that's fine. But it's very slow paced and has some very noticeable plot holes. I'm truly shocked that it got something like a 96% rating from the critics."

","Before I even heard of this movie, I often thought 'what is someone was just constantly walking towards you, and you had to avoid them at all costs'. This question I asked myself would pair with possible solutions and scenarios, and was quite fun to think about. Not only was it fun, but it was terrifying. Seeing 'it' come at you from any distance would induce a strong panic that is displayed many times in this movie, which makes it so thrilling. Added to this was a clever intro, and various other smart ways to make this concept all the scarier.<br/><br/>I believe that emotional response is a very important part of quality film making, and one that It Follows should be praised for."
"Tweekums","8","1","2","7 August 2019"," A chiller with a sexual twist
","Jay Height is an attractive nineteen year old college student whose life is changed after a casual sexual encounter. Shortly after they have sex the boy chloroforms her. She wakes to find herself tied up and he explains the situation to her. He tells her that a being, who can appears as anybody known or unknown, will start to follow her. This person walks slowly but will won't stop coming for her; if it catches her it will kill her. The only way for her to escape is to pass it on to another person by having sex... however if that person is killed it will start going after her again. Only people being followed or who have been followed cab see it. Jay manages to get her friends to believe her and they try to help her escape but wherever they go it will surely find her.<br/><br/>This is a superior chiller. There are surprisingly few shocking moments, most notably the sight of a previous victim in an early scene. Rather than relying on a large body count and gory deaths we get a near constant feeling that something is about to happen. The way the threat is passed from one potential victim to the next; like a game of sexual tag is interesting thanks to the moral dilemmas it raises. The fact that the entity that follows is always referred to as 'It' reinforces the tag similarities even if here the person tagged is followed by It rather than being It. The cast does a fine job; most notably Maika Monroe who is great as Jay. Director David Robert Mitchell does an impressive job keeping the tension high without resorting to jump scares and violent scenes; this is helped by Rich Vreeland's atmospheric score. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to horror fans looking for something different."

It meanders around our protagonist and her friends as they laze around the Detroit suburbs in the intentionless way that teenagers do and barely even bothers to act like a horror film at all. Except for some ominous tones from a pretty good synth soundtrack to clue us in, it would feel a little like a mumblecore film.<br/><br/>Once J goes on her date and sleeps with him, the plot of the film is of and running. Well, more like plodding. The film is slow but after J is drugged and he date reveals that there is a mysterious supernatural stalker/killer whose target is passed along through sexual intercourse there is at least some plot structure to hang the scares and themes upon. As she runs from and eventually faces the It with the help of her friends, J endures, succumbs, and eventually grows to accept the trauma that is now a part of her life."

First, the acting is excellent as are the characters and the plot is an edge of your seat thriller, so I understand why it quickly became a cult classic fave of movie bloggers. The simple idea that a virus stemming from a social disease can take the form of a paranormal entity with human form and strengths is unnerving in and of itself. This is one that you won't want to watch alone, in the dark or on a rainy evening. The moral of the story is ""young men and women, mind your morals for there may be dire consequences.""

The following part is creepy. It's not so creepy when they get close to a victim.

","I tell people I like horror. But it can be so hard to find a good one. Even one that doesn't ultimately annoy me. Even the ones everyone says are superior kind of annoy me, like The Conjuring. This movie is sort of...the anti-Conjuring.<br/><br/>But this one is different. Before watching I had a firm idea of the kind of thing I wanted to see in a horror movie: characters move into new location, uncanny things start to happen, characters only gradually become aware of an incorporeal menace and never fully appreciate the amount of danger they are really in.<br/><br/>This turns that around. We are informed very early on who is our enemy. They are tangible, identifiable, a character literally points to it. We know its attributes; it's invisible to everyone but one specific target, it will appear as different things to the one specific target, it cannot be beaten in a fight, but it walks everywhere.<br/><br/>We know how it goes about things but not why. And the movie never tells us. There is no lengthy scene searching the web. It gets no name. There are no ""paranormal experts"" popping in to arm us. It's not a supernatural thriller marketed as a horror. This is legit.<br/><br/>We are not confined to one area, the movie does not waste time cruising for our sympathy with kids and a dog and a family. We have a bunch of teens that need to keep moving. It's breezy and often somewhat hypnotic with its low key tone with a sense of danger always on the low boil, the sense of dread and urgency still never leaves you. Never. There is also an agreeable utilisation of backgrounds<br/><br/>it's not perfect: I feel the movie really spoils its own atmosphere when the follower shows emotions (hissing; why do all horror monsters hiss now?), but it is testimony to the freshness of the movie that I can look past this and still give it 8/10.<br/><br/>I don't like the lavatorial stuff either but whatever.<br/><br/>I know it became a sort of ""indie darling"" but don't let the pretentious fans put you off.

It isn't the most well written scene in the entire movie, but I think it fits the movie well and when I was watching it I never thought it was detracting from the story. I was surprisingly pleased with the quality of the acting, but with a good director anything's possible. All movies start at a neutral rating of 5 for me, and this movie goes up to a solid 9.

","A perfect horror movie to watch around Halloween time is ""It Follows"", a story about a group of high school students trying to protect their friend Jay Height (Maika Monroe) who has unwittingly become the last link in a chain of sexual partners thus making her the sole prey of an unknown supernatural predator only she can see. It can look like a young woman wearing a torn blouse and dripping urine from beneath her skirt, a naked man standing on the roof of her own home, or a tall man who could easily pass for ""Lurch"", the awkward butler from ""The Addams Family"" TV sitcom. And the only way for her to survive is by having sex with someone else to pass along the curse.<br/><br/>Jay has sex for the first time with her new boyfriend Hugh (Jake Weary) and everything is going great until he forces her to realize that she is now the lowest member of a human food chain strung together through sexual encounters and warns her to run away from any stranger who is walking directly at her. His nightmarish tale comes true a few days later when Jay glances out the window of her classroom and sees an old woman wearing a hospital gown walking across the lawn headed in her direction. She escapes this first encounter and runs home to seek help from her sister Kelly (Lily Sepe), her childhood neighbour Paul (Keir Gilchrist), and another close friend Yara (Olivia Luccardi) who circle the wagons around her. Later, a mutual high school acquaintance Greg (Daniel Zovatto) follows them into the park and drives them out of the city for safety.<br/><br/>""It Follows"" has everything horror movie fans enjoy; a twisted story line, resilient survivors, smooth flowing dialogue, and genuine cinematic appeal. This supernatural curse has been passed along quietly from one sexual partner to the next without alarming anyone else in the small town. Jay and her high school friends are mature enough to hang onto their low paying jobs yet still enjoy a carefree day at the beach. They can talk to each other without resorting to slang or trash talk yet each can poke fun at the others with a pretty sharp needle. The empty high school hallway Jay runs through and the deserted beach where Yara splashes around in the water as the others hang back on the sand are perfect settings for the attacks that follow.<br/><br/>This movie packs a real psychological wallop without resorting to a lot of screaming or hysteria. Yara is left behind to nurse her gun shot wound while Paul and Kelly methodically go around the indoor swimming pool deck following Jay's finger points trying to kill a creature they cannot see. Yet the gruesome body of the first teenage victim and Greg's disturbing death scene are enough to satisfy the most sophisticated horror genre fan.<br/><br/>There is no explanation for the low rating given by the IMDb's user reviews except perhaps poor word of mouth at the box office because ""It Follows"" stands alongside two other great movies, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""The Shinning"" as a classic horror film. This movie deserves ten out of ten."

","It Follows is one of those horror movies that really stick out for me. It's tense and scary like any horror should be but what I really like about this movie is the subtly. The idea itself leaves me incredibly paranoid and anxious. I see someone in the background of this movie and wonder if it's the thing hell bent on finding the main character. The symbolism of things like the colour red showing up when 'it' is around is really interesting and awesome. <br/><br/>I like the theme of loss of innocence and young adults finding their purpose although I can maybe see why some might read it as some sort of 'anti-sex' message. I personally just see it as a coming of age story. 'It' can be seen as many things from the impending loss of youth or the fact that no matter what, we all die. Death always follows. Or you could view it as a STI; it's really open for interpretation which I love. <br/><br/>This movie also does a lot of cool call backs to classic horror stuff like the amazing soundtrack by Disasterpeace.

"newguy85","6","1","2","24 April 2017"," Misled by ""scary"" reviews & Thoughts on establishing rules
","I was thrown off by the time period in which the movie supposedly takes place. It was intentional per the director, but it was distracting. I think the movie needs to tell the viewer when the setting is somehow to let them know the ""rules""- for example a kid can't have a cell phone in a 90s movie, but it's expected for a movie in present day.<br/><br/>There isn't a lot of dialogue, a vast majority of the ""sound"" is a very 80s dreamlike synthesizer which adds to the dreamy direction of the movie. It's very prettily filmed, but there are a lot of slowly- turning shots which seem pointless. There are also a few times that the director started a sense of dread with a scene, then messes it up with his choices. Here's what I mean: there is a scene where Jay (the protagonist) is walking through a dark house, the camera follows behind her, closely, so you know something is coming, but you don't know where. Right before the reveal happens, the director switches the shot to film from the monster's perspective in the next room, so when Jay walks into the room and is surprised, we aren't. The movie's ""rules"" for the monster are pretty rigid- it walks slowly in a straight line to its intended target, so by definition, you know that Jay isn't going to be surprised from behind, because it doesn't appear out of thin air. My point is, what could've been a good climax to a build up, ends up being secondhand.<br/><br/>The final confrontation with the monster seems to bend the rules already established in the movie, so it falls flat. There are also two scenes in which two characters appear as if they are going to pass it on to random hosts, but nothing is shown (all other sexual encounters are) so it ends up again leading the viewer to question the established rules.<br/><br/>Overall, I was extremely disappointed because I had read multiple accounts of this being the scariest movie in a decade, and I loved the concept, but the movie just isn't scary, and there are too many questions to make it a good piece of film. I'm not going to destroy it in the ratings because there is much worse (and the acting was actually good) but I feel like I'm below the average here, so I gave it a 6."

I assume this is supposed to build tension, I just found it annoying. I finished watching this film because I kept hoping something would happen, and I would have settled for anything other than walking.<br/><br/>Given the plot of being killed by an STG, one would assume there'd be some moral decisions to make about passing on the STG. If there were, none of the characters cared, or the actors/writers/director simply couldn't communicate that through words or actions. <br/><br/>I didn't like the characters. I didn't care when they died. I didn't care when they faked being afraid.

","We're all familiar with the old slasher movie trope 'Have sex and die'; well, that's what happens in It Follows, but it's not a machete wielding maniac who comes a-calling after its characters bump uglies but rather a deadly STD: a Sexually Transmitted Demon!<br/><br/>After dropping her knickers for boyfriend Hugh (Jake Weary), pretty teenager Jay (Maika Monroe) is informed that she is now being followed by a supernatural entity that will kill her if it catches up with her, and that the only way to stop it from doing so is to 'pass it on'. Understandably upset, Jay confides in her sister Kelly (Lili Sepe) and friends Paul and Yara (Keir Gilchrist and Olivia Luccardi), who are somewhat sceptical but willing to help. With the malevolent being approaching at walking speed, Jay has plenty of time to consider her options, but must keep an ever watchful eye out for the creature, which can take on many different guises and is invisible to the uninfected.<br/><br/>Like its monster, It Follows moves at a steady pace, but is never dull thanks to its ingenious plot, engaging performances from its talented young cast, and spot-on handling from writer/director David Robert Mitchell, who cleverly keeps the viewer as much on their toes as the film's central character. While the subject is somewhat reminiscent of J-horror classic Ringu, the atmosphere Mitchell achieves is more akin to the foreboding tension of John Carpenter's Halloween, with careful framing of each shot leading to heightened tension, and a suitably brooding synth score (by Disasterpeace) only adding to the fear factor. Gore is minimal, but effective when used (the early sight of one victim with her leg bent backwards, knee broken open, shows the true horror of the curse).<br/><br/>In a world where so many horror films are content with delivering cheap, jump scares, and practically non-existent character development, It Follows makes for a very refreshing change."

Literally, the movie just stopped - no resolution, no hint of something about to happen, nothing. It's like they ran out of film and just stopped rolling. And to call it an ""innocent"" sexual encounter? Wow. I must be turning into an old prude because I don't find anything ""innocent"" about spreading your legs for some guy you just met. That alone made me not care about the young woman and consequently, not be too upset about her fate. In addition, the characters had no substance - they seemed to be wandering around aimlessly.

It remains mystery what is it actually but looks like humans or zombies.<br/><br/>The film is rather interesting in its mystery of it. A sequel is for sure planned as there are many unanswered questions. Mine is: why that girl let herself be killed at the beach? And why she was killed like that? I actually think her body resembles some of Picasso's sculptures ( on the beach).<br/><br/>Also, it seems that IT is following the girl and the boy or only one of them at the end... Whom exactly? <br/><br/>Interesting story - for sure. It is entertaining. But can not say it is interesting and entertaining the whole time. Some parts are just slow and boring and unnecessary. <br/><br/>Rating six from me, though maybe five would be also true."
"cordleanthony","9","1","2","24 August 2016"," ""IT FOLLOWS"" a masterpiece from sound...YOU MUST SEE !
","It Follows is a masterpiece created out of the element of sound. If you watched this movie without sound you'd rate it a 3.1 simply because it stars Maika Monroe. An up and coming star you've seen in 5th Wave, Independence Day Resurgence and now It Follows. But this movie, created on a limited budget, jumps to a 9.0 and important enough for me to write my first review solely based on Disasterpeace's use of sound in the movie. Here is the star of It Follows.Rich Vreeland is the story behind this movie that YOU MUST SEE ! Most all of his work to date believe it or not has been video game technology. The sound track in this movie will have you scared to death from the opening scene til the credits which is where they first show you the title. I've collected Horrors and Sci-Fi since I was 11 and this movie I keep in my vault; for when the unsuspecting ask me ""do I have a good horror movie to watch""?"

","Nothing can make up for a poor script.<br/><br/>There is an interesting idea here, you have sex with a dude, then someone starts following you. That someone/something walks really slowly. They will find you and they can take on any appearance. They will kill you and then go back killing everyone that ""got it"" before. Sounds interesting right? I thought so to.<br/><br/>Casting was great and so was the acting but nothing can make up for an idea which is half baked and doesn't really go anywhere. Nothing much makes sense as the story unfolds and it ends with a low thump. Some of the later scenes are just funny as you see the writers trying to milk some drama in the pool which does not exist.<br/><br/>It's a pass for me if you are looking for a solid thriller film. Unfortunately this one is not it for me."
"stealthassasn158","7","1","2","22 March 2016"," crafty horror film
","Young adults and promiscuity often lead to bad things in horror features. The story's no different for It Follows, where main protagonist Jay (Maika Monroe) is cursed with an ominous, constantly pursuing ""it"" after having sex with her seemingly harmless boyfriend. Amidst heavy nods to the conventions of slasher films past, the caveat here is that, in the same way sex is the bringer of doom, it's also the singular path to salvation: if Jay has sex again, she will pass the ""it"" to her next partner, and so long as the new victim does not get caught by ""it,"" the chain continues. Allegory for STD? Can't be, that's too easy...but either way, it's certainly telling of one of the film's key charms: a sense of ambiguity. What time frame are we in exactly? Are there implications to the persons which ""it"" manifests as? What's the deal with that cliffhanger ending?! Horror films as of late are too much funhouse and not enough suspense, so it's refreshing to see It Follows doesn't rely entirely on out-of-nowhere jolts to justify its scares. Director David Robert Mitchell often incorporates a clever 360-degree camera pan that acts as the audience's wandering eye, always on the lookout for that foreboding figure that walks (and walks only...here's to you , Michael Myers) dead-set towards Jay. The film can occasionally slow down a bit, but this can be forgiven, as it contributes to the looming dread of waiting for ""it"" to next appear."
"Quinoa1984","10","10","60","21 March 2015"," tight, ambiguous, expertly directed horror
","It Follows doesn't use crap jump scares, nor the sort of Stupid Horror Movie Characters (to take a page from Ebert's Movie Glossary) and work to annoy the viewer or just be there for a certain 'demographic'. The film doesn't even feel like it takes place in this decade, though it very well may; the cars, the settings the styles, even the music, and the latter sounds like riffs from some obscure-but-magical genre treat from the 1980's. In the way it presents its characters and situations, it has a (modern) timeless quality of young people trying to figure out who they are, their loves and friends, who other people are, and... all it takes is the screws on the wheels of trust.<br/><br/>It Follows is about Jay (Maiyka Moore, an actress I hope to see more of very soon), who has been dating a guy named 'Hugh' (Jake Weary) for a while. They finally do 'it' on a date, and Hugh-Cum-Jeff reveals that he has passed on 'It' to her. He didn't really mean any hatred or ill-will by it - if it wasn't her, really, it would've just been someone else - and now ""It"" will follow her unless she passes it on to someone else via sex, otherwise 'It' will kill her, then kill him, and go on down the line. <br/><br/>Where did 'It' come from? Is it some sort of supernatural-alien-otherworldly entity? Who knows. All that is of concern to Jay is that a) ""It"" cannot be easily killed or out-run, and it certainly isn't the Stephen King 'It' (though parallels about the fear of the unknown can certainly be drawn), and b) it's real, and it's if she and her friends don't destroy it (two of who may or may not sleep with her, out of chivalry more-so possibly than romance), it'll ruin them all.<br/><br/>It Follows is the first great film, horror or otherwise, of this year. The newcomer writer/director David Robert Mitchell delivers paranoia drenched from every scene of this work, and his camera, editing, music, pacing, and his choice of actors (the minor roles as much as the major ones) give this pure tension and horror. It's a horror-show that occasionally does throw on some gore, but only when it really counts and matters, like if a supporting character gets offed (I won't say who, don't worry), but it's purely about creating mood and unease. It's rare to get a film where you don't know what can come next, and it being exciting and terrifying without irony.<br/><br/>Going in I was also worried that the movie might be some kind of rabid anti-sex statement due to how 'It' is passed, but it's not that at all. The filmmakers are just concerned with making things as intense as possible with, mostly, by letting things play out in real time, relatively few cuts, and naturalistic acting and writing (but in good, relatable, un-cliché ways). In filmic language, It Follows is a precise, foreboding study of the power of foreground and background: who will be IT next? Every person walking could be 'it', or nothing at all.<br/><br/>The lack of any full on explanation of the origins of this entity or presence or undead killer makes things all the more horrifying; and even after its not shown to be in-the-head of the main character, it turns still into a tale of a walking, living-breathing nightmare, again punctuated by that sinister synth score creeping up on the viewer like the 'It"". Comparing this to early Carpenter and Polanski is not without hyperbole - in boilerplate log-line-language it's Halloween and Repulsion, but it's still more unusual in presentation, effective, and expertly, shockingly astute in its direction, especially with the dollop of ambiguity. If anything, this is the antidote to dumb slashers where characters are killed off due to ""Sex is Bad"". It turns that convention on its head by having something that can't be easily explained away with a bad childhood or tragic drowning or other. If anything, this 'thing' is closer to a shark.<br/><br/>Go see this movie, preferably on as big a screen as possible, and with a significant other to snag on to your arm tight."
"DannX68","3","15","100","19 April 2015"," Skip it *may contain spoilers*
","I lowered my expectations quite a bit, since The Babadook got so rave reviews last year and that movie was rage-inducing bad. This isn't much better. Aside from the obvious ""if young women have sex, they will die"", I kept thinking that this was like The Ring but with genitalia. So, yeah. There were, of course, a few jump scares (one of which, admittedly, was effective). Then there's the score... never have I heard such an obtrusive, annoying, obnoxious score for a movie. And it was there THE! WHOLE!! TIME!!! Every time the music started I rolled my eyes and thought ""Jeez, not again"" and then it stopped... and not even 20 seconds later it started up AGAIN! And again... again... and so on. I think a LOT of the scenes would have worked better if they had been played out in silence. Also, the panning of the camera. Time and again the frame rested on or strolled along something that had NADA to do with anything. This also became eye-roll moments for me. Avoid; if you're hungry for some good, new horror, go for something like As Above So Below."
"rob_todd1","6","5","24","1 March 2015"," Passable
","I feel for horror film makers. It must be really difficult to make something different and original, though ultimately that is down to the amount of material being produced by horror writers. It Follows follows a pretty typical formula of a curse that needs to be passed on for the cursed to free themselves from the consequences. Having sex with the next victim is a twist but doesn't really add enough to make the film original or thrilling enough to warrant more than an average film. That said, some of the delivery is good. Even if the material is familiar we all like to be scared and the score and the tension does build effectively in some key scenes. So whilst no horror classic, It Follows does tick some boxes and is worth a viewing by any horror aficionado. Though I expect infrequent horror goers may come away a little more satisfied."

"jkbonner1","4","9","54","15 May 2015"," It follows what?
","I saw this movie based on a movie review in a national magazine to which I subscribe The magazine gave it a 4 out of 4. Based on this review, I saw the movie. I have no idea what the reviewer was thinking of. On this rating scale I'd give it a 1.5. At very best a 2. The music score was pretty good.<br/><br/>This movie could have been called Young Adult Angst in Spades. There are few adults in the movie and those that do occasionally show up have minute parts that last a few moments. They could easily have been left out entirely. The movie plays on the worst fears of a young adult. To be followed by some creepy guy or woman who shows up unexpectedly when you were just feeling safe and secure. The only new spin the movie gives it is all this is a curse brought on by having sex with someone who already has the curse.<br/><br/>Jay (Maika Monroe) has a date with a guy (Jake Weary) to see a movie. Shown in a movie theater that looked like one straight out of the 1940s BTW (nothing wrong with that-surprised it's still around). The guy has the curse and he takes Jay to a strange deserted parking structure and they make love. Not an exactly romantic place to make love in but fits in with the creepy theme. After the love making they see a creepy creature creeping towards them. Slowly. And I mean slowly.<br/><br/>So, Jay now catches sight of creepy creatures creeping slowly towards her all over the place. This really freaks her out. Kelly (Lili Sepe), Jay's sister, and Paul (Keir Gilchrist), Kelly's boyfriend, try to help Jay rid herself of the creepy creatures. As an aside, at the beginning of the movie it's suggested that if you get tired of creepy creatures creeping slowly towards you and you just give up, they eventually catch up with you and rip your limbs off. But Jay doesn't know this.<br/><br/>Anyway, Kelly is OK with Paul sleeping with Jay so the curse will be passed on to him (Paul's been lusting after Jay for a long time anyway so this works for him). They make love and then wait in dire expectation. But nothing happens. True love triumphs over the curse of the creepy creatures creeping slowly? <br/><br/>It's hard to make a really good spook movie. I'll concede that. Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece in this genre, The Shining, raised the bar awfully high. If you're going to make one, probably best to create a good bit of psychological scaffolding to support the spook part, as the recent The Babadook did.<br/><br/>A 4 out of 10. As I said, the music score was pretty good. And that old theater (guess it still exists in Detroit). Wow! I liked that."

I spent most all of the movie waiting for something anything, to actually scare me. The by-rote sudden appearances of ""it"" were wildly inconsistent and sometimes laughable, but never scary. The best of the movie was the backdrop of Detroit's abandoned neighbourhoods, which were actually more horrifying than the rest of the movie.

I mean it was food & creepy, but it lacked explanation primarily because people now just expect you to know whats going on as if your mind readers which irritates me!

","There are many types of horror movies: gore porn, slasher movies with jump scares galore, and the slow paced creepy and eerie atmospheric films.

""It Follows"" follows in the same vain.<br/><br/>It is slow, but well-paced, has a great accompanying soundtrack which build on overbearing sense of dread. However, what it is not is scary. The problem lies within its premise. It is unique and interesting – an STD that comes with your own personal spirit-thing that tries to kill you. It slowly and unendingly walks towards you, and if it gets you, it kills you. The emphasis here is on the word slow. It doesn't even walk at a normal speed. You could just briskly walk away from it. At no point was there tension; at no point did I fear for the main character's life.

And the only way to get this ""demon"" to stop following you is to pass it on to somebody else via sexual intercourse. It Follows made people fear sex like how Alfred Hitchcock made people fear showers at motels or how he made us all fear ""Birds"". <br/><br/>It follows serves itself interesting from the harrowing beginning scene to the creepy ending. Creepy is just a way to explain this movie. It sends a chill up your spine and it stays there. It makes you wonder, what would you do? What would you do if you had some demon that could take the place of any human on earth- even a loved one- and if it reached you, it would kill you. The main plan is to pass it on and to pray that whoever you give it to doesn't die or it will come back to you.<br/><br/>This movie is very entertaining, written very well and has a stellar casting. Some parts of the movie seem to drag but it keeps a pretty good standard at maintaining a chilling ambiance. The only possible downside would be two certain scenes that dabble in CGI and makes the movie lose its mystery. Other than that, the movie is very mysterious and harrowing.

"dangent280","5","7","46","6 March 2015"," Every Step You Take
","Oh I do love a good horror movie. Last years' The Babadook took home first prize for being the best in it's respective category whilst so far this year, there has been an array of sub-par horror films such as The Woman in Black 2 and REC 4. Now we have It Follows, which has been dubbed, ""smart, original, and above all terrifying,"" by the critics consensus on Rotten Tomatoes, starring Maika Monroe, last seen in the rather bonkers, The Guest. Although I am usually in accordance with what Rotten Tomatoes say about the quality of films, this is a rare occasion where I have to disagree, with It Follows not being overly smart, not really being original, and definitely not being terrifying. Sorry RT.<br/><br/>It Follows tells the tale of Monroe's character, Jay, who after having a bit of fun-and-games with boyfriend Hugh, starts to become haunted by a shape-shifting wraith-like entity which only she can see and can only be ""passed on"" by having more fun-and-games with other people. Sounds like a cool premise doesn't it? I mean you have the generic teen-sex-is-bad-and-should-be-punished vibe running throughout, which has been done countless times before, and a pretty funky 80's synth soundtrack, which has been done before, rounded off with those kind of eerie and spooky long shots of people walking down even longer pavements, or sidewalks if stateside, which has been done before, and more effectively in umm what's that film? Oh yeah, Halloween. So in terms of originality, I wholeheartedly disagree, with It Follows basically ripping the foundations of Halloween from it's feet and replacing Michael Myers with combination of a really tall guy, a naked woman, and a guy who gets really angry when near a swimming pool.<br/><br/>In terms of fear factor, I think I managed to properly jump once, and this was only when the film resorted to the ever-so-original quiet, quiet, quiet, LOUD process which horror films tend to go for these days when they think the audience might have become bored or even worse, fallen asleep, with the loudness of cinemas these days being more than capable of wakening anyone from the deepest of sleeps. In fact, they should have put Schumacher in one when he was in his coma. That would have woken him up. Hope you get better soon Mike. So, back to the movie, not one time during the film could I honestly say I felt under threat, whilst the long-drawn out scenes in between each entity attack becoming seemingly more boring than the last. So, in terms of being, ""above all, terrifying,"" I once again disagree.<br/><br/>Enough slating. In it's best moments, It Follows is a solid re-hash of better films of its' type, such as Halloween, with the acting being pretty much top-notch, particularly from leading lady, Maika Monroe, who gives a particularly good performance as the victim of the slowly walking entity that I will name ""It"". When it's dull, it's dull, and the originality and scares that the film promised were overly lacking, resulting in another film that has suffered from it's necessity to generate hype and declaration at being, ""one of the most striking American horror films in years."" Um, it's not.<br/><br/>Overall Score: 5/10"

","Because of the high ratings I expected to be well entertained with this movie, especially because it's a horror movie and horror movies rarely tend to get high ratings. I was going to give it a seven star rating as well but due to the mediocre ending it dropped a point for me. The story itself is new and refreshing in this genre. Much better then the usual stuff we get to see. It could have been way better if they had put some scarier people following because now the followers were just random figures that were not that scary at all. The actors were all good in their roles though. Nothing bad to say about them. But to me it was just not scary enough to be categorized in the horror genre and the end wasn't good either. Slightly disappointed."

","While I'm not into supernatural films, I did grow up on A Nightmare on Elm Street which this film totally represented. Speaking of which, it was thoroughly refreshing for these filmmakers to go back to the absolute basics vs. the oh-so-boring and over-used haunted house tale of the past decade or so. That said, they worked on many themes of the past and made it a little more modern and realistic, so I completely appreciated that. <br/><br/>Well done and recommended for anyone who wants to go back to what makes horror work vs. found footage or the bland haunted house they can't sell."

There's no real character moments to elevate this film to a score of 8/10. <br/><br/>The Babadook was pretty overrated too, but was better than It Follows. I had high expectations for both films.

So what you basically have is a movie where a bunch of morons drive around quite a bit, people who lurch menacingly about, and I'm supposed to be scared. <br/><br/>And there's the ending. Don't worry; I will NOT give it away, but to me it just said ""we're desperate to end this movie and we really don't know how, so we'll just do this."" <br/><br/>Rated ""R"" for language, brief nudity, and (laughable) images, perhaps it's time for me to stop reviewing horror period.

Many things do not make sense in this film but that is not down to poor direction, believe me, I studied this film late last year. David Robert Mitchell includes these nonsensical elements to create a world which is literally a nightmare.<br/><br/>Maika Monroe establishes herself as a modern day scream queen with her performances in this, and in the 2014 film The Guest, and looks to have a very promising career in this genre.<br/><br/>A lot of the films success has to be down to Disasterpeace's musical score. a tribute to John Carpenter and slasher horror films, the music gives me Goosebumps every time I hear it, especially the 8 bit dissonant screech similar to Psycho.<br/><br/>I'm not a frequent watcher of horror films but I would say that It follows is definitely worth a watch on the big screen as I've seen this film three times. The first time in the cinema at night. I was so scared by this film I actually had a panic attack after the film had finished, this is probably more down to me being a wimp more than anything, but, for a film to garner that kind of response from me surely has done its job, and has done it well.<br/><br/>This film is probably quite tame for horror fans who have been numbed by frequent viewing of the genre, but to others this film should be wonderfully scary.

This movie makes for a scary good time. This girl is constantly being followed by someone that you may not see it coming right away or you do see it coming but it's creepy tone almost makes you want to run away. The music in this film definitely drives this film in the right direction. That combined with the film's unsettling plot make the perfect mix. After all that is what made Halloween a great movie.

This is the first serious film of David Robert Mitchell, an obviously extremely talented director that you should keep an eye on. The movie on the surface talks about some kind of supernatural virus that is transmitted through sexual intercourse (David Cronenberg influence spotted there). I know that sounds cheeky, but in fact the movie is an a deep allegory (I'm not going to say about what, that's up to your judgment). At the same time it's a surprisingly well made psychological horror movie that escalates slowly like all horror movies should (like classic movie ""The Exorcist"" does). Direction and sound are excellent and the dialogs between the characters imply more than the obvious. The ambiguous ending is fantastic. This is an art film that I have watched twice within a month.

"chaos-rampant","Null","2","8","10 November 2015"," Horror that weaves itself in the fabric
","Horror is illusion that unfolds in space, mind itself. Nothing else needs said, much less a whole story of explanations.<br/><br/>This was Halloween for me. It wasn't a story about this masked killer, how he's an embodiment of evil or all of the other things Loomis run around announcing to us. Loomis was merely the carnival barker - a PT Barnum - ushering us in the tent, grooming the encounter. It was the place you could inhabit from which horror sprang, a sleepy suburbia with kids dashing by on Halloween night and livingrooms dimly lit by TV.<br/><br/>And so it is here. There's a story here about a presence that attaches itself to people but it matters little. We have almost no mythos, no real explanations of particulars, the thing somehow exists and is passed on sexually. (I'm sure that will be one for sequels to ruin by explaining)<br/><br/>The rest is in being in that place, a quiet suburbia much like Carpenter's with the big houses and nicely kept lawn that shrieks can pierce. It's in the thing that will just lunge at you again and again until it gets you, taking any shape. In the running up and down houses that spills out into quiet suburban streets. <br/><br/>Everything you need to know is in the very first scene; a girl runs out of the house screaming on an afternoon, an ordinary day. The street is empty save for a neighbor unloading his shopping bags from a car, who asks is she OK. We have seen nothing, but something has scared her out of her wits.<br/><br/>We get a few silly popup moments that mar the effect, but the whole is cool, embodied in space, present. Something has insinuated itself in the fabric of things and occupies bodies that create encounters. My favorite of those is when an inexplicably tall man enters through a door, a chilling moment because of how it throws our footing in a solid reality asunder.<br/><br/>And if the world is a remarkable thing, it is not because we see the meaning of it at first and can point to it as something we can explain but on the strength of its chance occurrences and paradoxes."

I would think ""why would you want to pay to be scared?"" I haven't actually gone to the movies to see a scary movie unless I was being forced by friends to go. The movie that I just saw was a scary movie, but there was something unique about my experience. I actually didn't hate the movie. I also actually watched the movie instead of having my hands over my eyes for most of the movie. The movie I saw was called ""It Follows"", but it's a hard movie to really explain, but so you get the gist it's about a girl who is being followed by ""something"" that she can't let touch her or she'll die. This movie was unique as it looked like a different time period. The movie was very retro and had an interesting idea. The idea was scary and so was the movie, but it wasn't too scary. It was scary enough to put itself in the horror genre but allow me to watch it and actually enjoy the movie. The movie had a very cool look to it and it didn't follow the same theme of people doing stupid things to get them in scenarios. This movie was very cool to see and it was so unique for me as a viewer to actually enjoy the movie even though it did scare me, but it's message was also very cool and took a different way at getting that message across. Actually enjoying this movie surprised me so much as there were things that I try staying away from in other movies, but it was done in such a way that it was hidden to me, so that I didn't care about them and that they made the movie better."

It Follows doesn't have jump scares, lots of screaming, or gratuitous gore, which explains why it's only 7 stars on IMDb but 96% on Rotten Tomatoes.<br/><br/>The movie stills that you see online for this movie are misleading. They show a scantily-dressed girl bound in a chair, with a guy behind her, and he's showing her something. That makes it look like maybe a home invasion movie, or a serial- killer movie. But it's not. This is movie is strictly supernatural horror, and it has an original and well-executed premise that will keep you thinking about it for days.<br/><br/>My wife and I loved pretty much everything about this movie. The acting, cinematography, music, plot development and writing are all top-notch, and it's all quite an achievement for such a low-budget film.<br/><br/>The movie manages to fill you with dread and outright fear, and keeps it going in a way that I haven't seen since watching The Ring. But the amazing thing is that there's no mystery to unravel. It's all explained to you near the beginning of the movie. And the plot doesn't rely on certain characters not believing what's going on, or main characters doing stupid things, or other horror tropes. The whole movie is straightforward and still manages to be a great horror movie.<br/><br/>Can't recommend this movie enough."

The Unholy Three make a deadly combination whenever horror films are concerned. Pay heed: Have sex and you will become the next victim! Freddy, Michael, or Leatherface will absolve you from sin with a quick slice-and dice maneuver. It's the movie code. The latest supernatural fright-fest, It Follows, takes that common premise for a little spin. Oh, sex is still on the menu, but now, it can possibly save your life, making a no- win situation into a win-win. Let me explain without giving too much away.<br/><br/>￼Maika Monroe plays Jay, the teen in peril as an invisible force is set to kill her off. She has been cursed via a sexual transmitted encounter with her boyfriend. Now, a shape-shifting apparition will follow her to her death unless she can find another sexual partner to infect ASAP to stop this chain reaction. It is this dilemma that becomes the basis for the film and its minimal scares.<br/><br/>David Robert Mitchell shows promise. He is more skilled as a director than screenwriter. He gives his low budget film some nice highs with his strong imagery and adds moody suspenseful sequences that owe a great deal to John Carpenter and Wes Craven. Complete with an effective synthesized score to ratchet up the tension, the film has an eerie nightmarish atmosphere. Mitchell wisely downplays the monster, leaving much to the viewer's imagination. However, he still goes for too many cheap scare tactics with abrupt sound effects that go bump in the night.<br/><br/>￼It Follows doesn't quite follow the formula we moviegoers have come to expect. Which is good. However, what is bad is that the movie loses its focus midway in a script that is in need of some major rewrites, especially when logic is constantly lost along the way. There are too many dumb actions from our heroine and his friends, plus odd anachronistic items that make one wonder about the era and time-frame of the film when one should be more engrossed in the story. (Is it the 60's, 70's, or 80's?) Some leaps of logic occur in the flawed screenplay: Must teenagers always run to a deserted location in the middle of the night when being hunted? Are there any police or adults around to help? Has no one notice some strange deaths that are happening in the community?<br/><br/>￼While there is much to admire in the film's execution, the overall effect plus an unsatisfying ending only make It Follows just another victim in the horror genre. <br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

A creature that only she can see now will slowly creep towards her while taking the form of either a friend or a stranger. Jay's friends Yara and Paul (Olivia Luccardi and Keir Gilchrist) and her sister Kelly (Lili Sepe) don't believe her at first until they also begin to see this creature and all of its forms for themselves they decide to band together to either help Jay flee or to defend herself.<br/><br/>The first time I saw this is in the theater, there were a few issues. I unfortunately had to sit behind some of the most annoying people I have ever had to deal with sitting behind me and the sound system of the theater may have not been functioning properly. I still enjoyed it then and with no distractions, I enjoyed it even more the second time. I've seen my fair share of horror films and this film has to have one of the most original stories I've seen. I also like that it chooses to be more of a psychological type of horror movie with the scares coming mostly from the suspense of whether or not something happens to the main characters. Without giving anything away, I'll say things do happen. I personally found it suspenseful as it kept me on the edge of my seat not knowing when or from where the creature would come and also what it would look like. I enjoyed this feeling and that it something I like to feel when I'm watching this type of film. I was also a big fan of the film's style as I thought it looked campy and like a 70's/80's type horror film especially with the keyboard/synthesizer soundtrack playing in the background throughout. It's amazing (or maybe not) that every time there was a suspenseful part, the keyboard/synthesizer would be blaring. It shouldn't but it got me every single time. The cinematography was also a nice touch as it captures the desolation of Detroit beautifully. The only thing that I wasn't sure about was the acting, I'm not sure whether or not its good or bad. I couldn't really tell. Maybe it was intentionally bad because of what the film was trying to be based on the reasons I previously mentioned. I had no problem with any of it. They're teenagers, they're not supposed to be smart, they make bad decisions and that will be evident to anyone watching. I liked this because it made them more real. The story is original, don't get me wrong but I would have liked it if they explored the creature's origin a little more. Also some may not like the ending, but I wasn't one of them.

","It Follows is a breath of fresh air in a horror genre that has succumbed to using jump scares and over-the-top gore to engage its audience. It is suspenseful and borderline ingenious with its concept, but it also has some faults that lessen its lasting impression. <br/><br/>The plot of It Follows is as ominous as it is simplistic, yet it is a difficult to discuss without sounding ridiculous. Jay (Maika Monroe) is followed by an insidious force, what is essentially a shape shifting entity, after getting involved in a sexual encounter. She is instructed to ""pass it on"", i.e. sleep with someone else, effectively passing 'It' further down the chain. In short, the film is the product of personifying an STI, with even more horrific results. <br/><br/>The director David Robert Mitchell shoots the film in a clear homage to horror films from the genre's golden age, with a sinister and atmospheric mood along the lines of John Carpenter's original Halloween. The slow 360º degree pan and an emphasis on the foreground are used to superb effect, helping create an unnerving atmosphere. Add to this a top-notch soundtrack, echoing 80's horror synth-notes, and you have a very unsettling film indeed. Unfortunately some old horror clichés and contrived plot points designed to advance the story chip away at the film's core. <br/><br/>It Follows is the most original horror film since Cabin in the Woods (2012) and a refreshing take on the teenage horror genre, as long as you don't think about it too hard. <br/><br/>6/10"
"gortx","Null","2","9","7 June 2015"," Good, not great. Fine style, muddled finish
","IT FOLLOWS is a good, not great, movie. I appreciated how it patterned itself on Carpenter's HALLOWEEN with a dash of THE RING and an overlay of Cronenberg's early 'body horror' films. And, it even winks at the audience about those homages with characters watching TUBE TV sets with rabbit ears etc. The story is about a disease that is passed on by sexual partners and the only 'cure' is to pass it to someone else.<br/><br/>Stylistically, it's fine, but the last act of the film is unsatisfying. The themes, though potent, never really come together. Still, it's worth seeing as a respite from all the torture porn and shrill shock-cut movies that usually pass for 'horror films' these days. My issue with the last act of the movie is that it simply isn't as strong, nor as powerful as the first 2/3. Compare IT FOLLOWS to its acknowledged 'inspirations' (if this were music, this would be more of a slam dunk case than 'Blurred Lines'!), it comes up short: While it evokes the Body Horror of Cronenberg and creates a certain queasiness, it never punches you in the gut the way the best of the Canadian Director's work does.<br/><br/>The ending has a nice grace note, but it never really tackles the morality of passing on the 'disease' to another person in any strong way, as the ending of RINGU did. Or, the way in which the townsfolk in the first NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET shared culpability for what happened to create Freddy.<br/><br/>And, on a simple elemental level, Carpenter's HALLOWEEN has a drive and momentum that IT FOLLOWS' last act doesn't come close to re-creating. Obviously, Michael Myers doesn't have nearly the symbolic value as the 'disease' does in the newer movie, but, as a 'Horror Film' it picks up the tension as it goes along. IT FOLLOWS slacks as it stumbles towards it's conclusion. Part of it, is that there is a certain inevitability to how it will 'conclude', yet Director David R. Mitchell tries hard to follow the template of a typical 'horror ending', complete with the big pool 'climax'. (but, the savvy viewer should know that it's all much ado about very little). It also makes the (seemingly certain) idea of a sequel even more pointless than usual: It Follows Again? It Follows Yet Again? It's Still Following?"

Naturally, I had pretty high expectations. And it was a good movie, but that's all. The story was creative and well-written, the actors played their roles well, and it was a great film overall. However, considering that this was being praised as a horror movie, it wasn't scary. It was tense, dramatic, even thrilling at some points, but not scary. Like, not even a little bit. The only thing that ""scared"" me was the loud noise of something hitting a window. Which leaves me with the previously mentioned mixed feelings.

While it also appearing to be a homage to horror movies from the 70's. I gotta admit I personally was creeped out when it came to the mystery surrounding what was going on. And when the first few times the incident starts to happen I found that there was some tension there. But after a while the film didn't appear to be all that scary. Creepy but the tension started to wear off after a while. The plot isn't all that original and has been done in other horror movies before. In fact it sort of felt like a blend of ""Halloween"", ""Final Destination, ""Drag Me to Hell"" and ""The Terminator"" (1984). But what made this movie memorable was the execution and how it played upon with the atmosphere and the surroundings. Also the ambiguous mystery surrounding the plot actually added something alluring and yet creepy. Except I felt that certain things were a bit too ambiguous and certain things just didn't make much sense. Now I don't mean the characters had to get their magnifying glasses and start investigating like some of the mainstream horror movies that are out. But I felt certain explanations was needed to make this movie at least a bit more satisfying. Maybe it's being left out for the sequel that will delve into the origin of how the whole mess started. But since I am grading this movie right now, it felt like a good watch but lacked that high satisfying feel.

The sister and the friends surrounding them are also sympathetic characters.<br/><br/>The score in my honest opinion is an instant classic, as it casts a disturbing shadow onto the whole movie, including the supposedly heartwarming moments, which are not too many in this movie.Creepy 80's style.<br/><br/>Acting is also alright but nothing special, but one rarely expects academy award performances from horror movies anyways.<br/><br/>(Spoilers may happen from here!I did warn you!)<br/><br/>Where the movie stumbled for me then? Well, as haunting and clever as it starts, the more bored and dull it gets toward the end. I feel for Jay who got tricked and pulled into this sick and deadly ""tag game"" and in the beginnings I was actually scared and breathless whenever ""It"" showed up.<br/><br/>But then it starts fading away with every horroristic scene. Along with the carefully built-up ""feel for the characters"" feeling. These -at first I thought - smart and spirited teens don't make the smallest effort to find out what the hell is really happening, what is ""It"" aside from searching up the guy who was generous enough to pass the STD (sexually transmitted demon)to Jay. Somehow they are so cool- headed that the idea of beating up the bastard doesn't cross the mind of neither of them, instead they are having a nice chit-chat while sitting in the grass. <br/><br/>After that, they don't try to find an occultist, a crazy wannabe ghosthunter, an exorcist, nobody, they do not hit up google.The only thing they do is Jay sleeping around with all of the male members of the gang, even after the first try it becomes clear that it's not a long-term solution.<br/><br/>The creepy moments slowly starts to become less and less creepy, and the grand finale is as stupid as possible. I still have to think hard if I want to find out what they really wanted there with all those kitchen machines and other electronic devices around the pool and even then I have no idea.<br/><br/>Well. ""Haunted"" movies, as a genre have one thing in common. The hero/heroine tries his/her best to find out what is haunting them and how to get rid of it. Of course it sort of never works, just think of The Ring or that Sarah Michelle Gellar movie. But at least they are trying. Jay and her friends aren't. And it's disappointing and turns the otherwise almost good movie into a boring horroristic scene-chatting scene - mild sex scene - another horroristic but not that much this time scene - chatting scene- some more chatting scene- oh no, horroristic scene, this time longer - then mild sex scene then...you get the point.<br/><br/>At the end I only really felt for the pure prostitute. From the ending scene where ""It"" follows Jay and his not-in-the-friendzone anymore boyfriend (?)I guess she wasn't long lived after her encounter with this boyfriend mentioned above. (What was his name?!Oh well. )<br/><br/>Alright, that's it. I AM disappointed. A crappy and not creepy movie. Ba-dumb-tssh!"

The rating is indeed high and you may be tempted to see it, but don't go in with high expectations, and don't watch the trailer. Maybe if you watch it with little knowledge you can at least enjoy it.

The premise is really interesting and my interpretation is that IT is actually HIV virus, killing everyone it touches and is transmitted through sexual intercourse.

"elicopperman","3","1","3","31 August 2018"," I'm Sorry, But This Movie is Stupid
","You sometimes come across a horror movie that is so ridiculous by concept that one wonders why it was even made in the first place. It Follows is one of them. While I kind of get the critical acclaim and cult status behind the film, it left me so befuddled from its execution that I ended up laughing at it more than feeling genuinely scared. <br/><br/>The general storyline revolves around a teenage girl named Jay, who is constantly chased around by a supernatural spirit after having sexual intercourse. I can see where the premise could've worked, but having a curse brought up from mating makes the film come off as more stupid than creepy. Maybe if it were a blood oath that started it, I'd be more intrigued, but that ain't what we got. In addition, the pacing is rather monotonous, as we spend roughly half the movie on Jay and her friends running away, while also trying to stop the creature. I think half of that time should've been spent on learning about the mythos of the curse itself.<br/><br/>Where the story is too bizarre for a horror film, the characters range from bland, to annoying to even dumb. The actors are certainly trying their best, but we don't know much about Jay's friends outside of them having feelings for her and one or two quirks. Even Jay herself becomes so anxious about where the entity comes from that....well, let's just say she makes too many stupid decisions for her own good. BTW, when I say some of Jay's friends have feelings towards her, I ain't kidding. Without giving anything away, given that the curse comes from an STD, Jay at the very least feels bad for what she has to do to save herself, so I'll give credit and say that there is some genuine sympathy in her.<br/><br/>Another annoying factoid of the film is the soundtrack. I understand that it's supposed to make the audience feel as tense as Jay, and sometimes it pays off well. However, there are several moments where music is unneeded, and silence would've been more than enough. Also, some moments play scores that are way too loud and over the top, making the scenes feel too pretentious for their own good. Lastly, probably the film's worst offender is that it doesn't really end, it just sort of stops. I'm not saying all stories need to end off on a bang, but it was nonetheless very anticlimactic. Maybe it's a setup for a sequel, but it's still frustrating nonetheless.<br/><br/>Overall, It Follows had the makings of a decent horror flick, but its ludicrous concept makes it too laughable to be taken seriously, and the characters don't offer much in terms of substance. If you're into original films that at least offer intriguing ideas that stand out from the typical horror fare, then by all means check this out. However, if you can't take the concept with sincerity, then don't even bother. I do respect the filmmakers behind this for bringing their unique visions to life, but just because something is unique doesn't mean it'll work out in the end."

"parry_na","4","1","3","3 November 2017"," Spoilers follow ...
","We begin this with the sight of a pretty teenage girl in her shorts and underwear and high-heels, running away from something only she can see. Instant alarm bells ring with the probability that this will be just another glitzy, ditzy, horror-lite involving vacuous catwalk lovelies being stalked by a nasty man in a mask.<br/><br/>There are a lot more teens-in-shorts before it becomes apparent this isn't quite the shallow candy-floss I was dreading. This comes about with the courtship of blond Jay Height (Maika Monroe) and Hugh (Jake Weary), admirably waiting until their second date before having sex, during which Hugh passes on his 'affliction'. A similar passing on of the curse occurs with Greg (Daniel Zovatto), the next in line to have sex with Jay.<br/><br/>This seems to be a movie for teens by teens, where mundane anarchy runs moderate in a world where parents probably exist but are never there. Reminiscing about where they had their first kiss/beer in tiny, scratchy lost little voices alternating with scenes where they fall into lightweight sex seems like juvenile sensationalism to me. When the apparitions appear, there are moments of tension accompanied by an enigmatic 'retro' musical score by a collective called Disasterpiece. The finale has echoes of the Japanese 'Ringu 2 (1999)' in its setting.<br/><br/>Finally Jay gets to have sex with Paul (Keir Gilchrist), which may or may not pass on the curse. The very concept of a vague threat passed on by half-dressed young people coupling has a crassness that stops this film breaking out of its self-imposed 'teen fodder' stable of titillation, despite the interesting and well executed sense of occasional threat."
"MonsterVision99","4","1","3","31 October 2017"," Pretty bad
","""It Follows"" its one of those modern pretentious ""artsy horror"" films, horror movies that attempt to bring something new to the horror genre by trying to be serious and meaningful but end up falling flat every time.<br/><br/>This is horror for teenagers, something hipsters enjoy because it pays ""homenage"" to ""old"" horror films and references literature from time to time to make up for the fart jokes, the dull yet awkward characters (this is probably why so many teens identify with them) and the total lack of suspense. Who would think that a person walking slowly could be scary? the filmmakers certainly thought so, they even added ""creepy"" horror music and sounds, even the usual ""scary face"" from many mediocre horror films makes an appearance.<br/><br/>This one has a cult following, the people who like it are probably the kind of people who are nostalgic for ""retro horror"" and like the slow as hell scenes and the deadpan delivery from these actors. Its OK for people to like these kind of films, I have nothing against people liking stuff, its just not my cup of tea. I just want something honest, I watched Exorcist II: The Heretic for this October and I enjoyed that way more than this, even when it almost became a comedy because of how weird and crazy it was but that movie rejoiced in its absurdity to the point when it became an experience, when It Follows its absurd, its just dumb.<br/><br/>The rules for the ""monster"" sound really forced, it like they were trying to make the rules for what they thought would be a new classic but ended up with an unbelievable mess. <br/><br/>It has some good aspects, the music its pretty good, it deserves a better film. The cinematography was good too, it was ""independent artsy"" kind of good and there's not one memorable shot in the whole thing but still. The symbolism is so obvious it becomes meaningless, the characters are all unlikeable and its astonishingly boring."

","It's a difficult task to find a horror or thriller horror that's not campy or just plain silliness. For example, I loved Silence of The Lambs. I couldn't stand the Jason or Freddy series (after age 14, st least!) This film is atmospheric, spooky, and just plain good. My boyfriend can't stand horror movies of any sort and he loved this. This is right up there with films like The Ring as far as the feeling you get while you're watching. This can only stem from excellent production and directing. The characters are well defined and well-acted; a few years older than typical high school grads and are living in a sort of alternate reality, waiting for their real lives to begin. They're in college and living at home, all friends who have grown up together in their Michigan neighborhood. There are also some messages in this film: be careful who you are intimate with!"
"mhodaee","8","1","3","4 August 2017"," See what it would be like if one of your greatest fears is realized...
","There are so many reviews here and a lot has already been said, but I'd like to focus on what I think is the core and root of the terror in this film. I can say for sure that the following situation has happened to almost everyone, especially in their childhood: Imagine you're all alone in the house, sitting on the couch. All of a sudden you get one of those paranoid frights that the combination of silence, idleness, and being alone bring. Your eyes turn to the half open door of a room, or to the top of the wooden stairs behind you. You feel a sudden chill. You can't look away. What if someone, or something, comes in through that door or down the stairs? What's it gonna be like? What's it gonna do to me? What will I do? Can I evade it and get out of the house? etc. The fear keeps chewing at your soul until someone finally arrives and you're off the hook. Would you like to see and feel what it would be like if such a thing could become an actual threat, something real, and much more terrifying than you could have imagined? That is something It Follows skillfully manages to pull off. It's a nightmarish ride, slow but captivating. It doesn't shock you with a sudden 200-volt electrical current, but it makes sure you're connected to a low-voltage one throughout the movie. Its against-the-grain approach to the concept of horror gets a hold on you, one that would probably stick with you long after you're done watching it. Sure, the premise might seem to be no different than a cliché horror flick; a girl infected by a demonic entity transmitted through sexual intercourse, the usual scenario where a couple of teenagers struggle with a curse and go searching for clues to figure out how to get rid of it. It Follows, however, is much more than that. It's like a tiny little bug that's placed on your palm. It appears harmless at first, but while you're unaware, it slowly crawls into your ear and your brain, infecting you with a bone-chilling thought. It's by no means perfect, of course. There are plot holes that might occur to you after you're done watching it, and at times the rhythm becomes annoyingly dull and slow. It's not perfect, but it doesn't need to be. It does what it intends to do quite well, and frankly, with such a budget, it's more than acceptable. If you're into horror of the psychological kind, you will definitely get enjoyment out of this film. If it doesn't happen the first time you watch it, it will probably come to you once you give it serious thought or watch it a second time. Long story short, it's a genuine and admirable attempt at psychological horror, a la Babadook!"

","If you have seen the whole movie then go and watch the first scene again. Trust me, you would see a lot this time.<br/><br/>The common themes of horror movies haven't changed for a long time. The new movies just shuffles the general pool with little to no original input. This movie is something new on its own. It was scary without the CGI or the jump scares or the dark alleyways. This by itself says a lot about this movies quality.<br/><br/>The story is very good. The director did a good job giving life to the story. I liked how he ignored the common structure of horror movies. He could've easily followed the norm even with this story to scare people, but thankfully he didn't. The overall tone is calm and there is very little explanation of whats going on which always keeps the viewers in a state of soothing suspense, if that makes any sense. I also enjoyed the key characters not being plain stupid like the other horror movies.<br/><br/>I have some issues with the pool scene. This might seem being too much skeptical but bullets don't travel very far under water. And another thing bugged me. Why didn't they just slept with a prostitute and passed it on. The chance of this curse moving down a big chain of people is very high in that case.<br/><br/>Overall this was a good movie. One shouldn't simply just skip the chance of watching this."

"crakatoot","3","1","3","21 March 2017"," So Much Wasted Potential
","I showed this movie to my teenage niece. She's becoming a horror fan and I've shown her a few films, The Shining, Scream etc. We watched this together. I asked her what she thought. Now I've taken film criticism classes and television criticism classes and anyone who has taken those classes knows, sometimes you end up way over analyzing things. She was only fourteen at the times, so I figured she would have a some what less clouded view of the movie. And ... she hated it. I asked her why. She thought it over for a second and finally answered ""That girl stunk, she spent the whole movie looking bored or confused."" And that pretty much summed it up. Now I love horror films and this film really did have a great premise. This thing doesn't run or appear in your dreams or call you on the phone, but it just never stops. And I liked the visuals also. I loved the whole throw back 70's vibe. But the characters, they are just not there. They have no real development, personality or characterization. Mostly they just stare off into space and look sad. And that, is really lame. This is a problem a lot of movie have nowadays. They adopt that Terrence Malick style, where all emotions and feelings are kept at an arms length. Movies like Foxcatcher or the Master have the same problem. I'm not saying everything in a movie should be spelt out in black and white but everything shouldn't be vague and ambiguous as well.<br/><br/>Its not very engaging. <br/><br/>And the main character Jay, she is just so meh. Look at Halloween, the character of Laurie Strode wasn't exactly Hamlet but she did have a personality and she was likable and in the end you wanted to see her save the children and escape Michael Myers. Same thing with Kirsty Cotton in Hellraiser or Sidney Prescott in Scream and a ton of other movies. <br/><br/>This movie is trying to emulate so many other horror and while it has some elements down pat, others it's missing entirely. At the end of the movie did anyone really care what happened to the Jay character. No, of course not.<br/><br/>I know the critics liked it, but no, just no."
"CantripZ","Null","1","3","27 February 2016"," About 90% Great
","What I liked, or even loved, about this movie is the same stuff that drew everyone in.<br/><br/>The film looks great, Detroit is a textured and very un-Californian place. The cast is interestingly ordinary-seeming, even the pretty protagonist. The story is nuanced and interesting, and the pacing is deliberate rather than Hollywood (which I'd describe as ""frenetic-with-pauses-for-rote-character-development"").<br/><br/>I dislike over-explained sf/fantasy/horror, and it didn't go there. I dislike films where everyone does or doesn't believe the protagonist in a blatantly schematic fashion, and I'm really glad it didn't go there, either.<br/><br/>Another thing I'm not into is horror movies based on monster-killing action scenes, so there's one scene in this film that almost spoilt it for me. It's basically my only gripe about the film, so it's a shame it's such a pivotal and dramatic scene, giving us the setup for the ending. It was either a clumsy attempt at an action scene or a failure to up the stakes from the suspense that came before.<br/><br/>Luckily, what followed was in fact a good ending, and by the time the credits finally rolled I was back on side again. I liked almost everything about the movie, after all. The script, the look, the performances, the concept, the ending...<br/><br/>90% great is a vast improvement over most US horror movies I've seen lately, so I'll try not to complain too much about that one scene."
"judypancoast","4","12","117","28 March 2015"," Does NOT Live up to the Hype
","I am completely disappointed in this movie...especially after all the great reviews. I rarely write reviews, but if I can save one other person from being as disappointed as I was, then the time spent is worth it. First of all, the synopsis here and in other places online is an outright LIE>"" ...But after a seemingly innocent sexual encounter, she finds herself plagued by strange visions and the inescapable sense that someone, something, is following her.""<br/><br/>SPOILER: She doesn't have strange visions or an ""inescapable sense..."" blah blah blah. She knows RIGHT AWAY what is going on because the guy she has sex with ties her up and exposes it to her right away, explaining what is happening and telling her what to do to get rid of it. So this intimation that there's all this suspense in trying to figure out the mystery is bull.<br/><br/>Secondly, the loving long shots of scenery were fine in the beginning but they got REALLY old after a while. Please see The Ring to find out how this SHOULD be done to add to the atmosphere of a film.<br/><br/>Third, the score that everyone is raving about is loud, amateurish and distracting. It doesn't enhance the film at all. It's inappropriately ""fun"" in several scenes and has no obvious theme. Comparing it to John Carpenter's work is a laugh. More like Napoleon Dynamite. No, wait..that's an insult to Napoleon Dynamite. <br/><br/>Fourth, what freaking year is this supposed to be? All of the appliances...TVS, radios, phones, electric TYPEWRITERS, are straight out of the 70s, yet once character has an e-reader or a cell phone or whatever that clamshell things is supposed to be. Again, these anachronisms don't add to the aura...they are just distracting. I kept thinking..""Was this movie filmed in some country where they don't have modern things?""<br/><br/>Last, it WAS NOT SCARY. There were a few cheap jump-in-your-seat moments, but the idea of someone walking toward me who might hurt me but can't walk fast is really dumb. Just exactly what does it DO? We see the results of one such encounter at the very beginning, but aside from the weirdo SPOILER mom character having sex with her dead son, I can't figure out how she killed him.

"dana_archer-180-381255","6","4","27","2 March 2015"," It follows , it didn't quite deliver
","I found it follows a scary and disturbing flick that had many windows that could have improved it. A thing follows her once she is passed this curse via sex. A QUESTION : WHAT is this thing for starters? Q2 WHY IS IT FOLLOWING THEM? Q3 WHY MUST IT BE PASSED ON BY SEX?. With no explanation we are left wondering is it a spirit of someone who was raped and killed and has a vengeance or is it just a good theory. When they did take the opportunity to scare they did it with success as we see various messed up characters following this scared little girl. Although at the start she is warned that it could turn into one of her friends yet the director doesn't actually use that to make any intense twists or pain. As low budget independent horrors are in right now since the Stunning BABADOOK. It seems now would be the perfect time to make a hit, Which means you need to push as many scares and intensity as you possible can to make your film better than the rest. Some history heritage and better scares would have made this a really scary flick. It did have scares and the brilliantly thought up concept will give you a fright yet it fails when it comes to keeping the scares. there are also some stupid and unexplained scenes. For example the thing is supposed to follow her everywhere at all times, yet she manages to sleep on top of her car overnight in the woods without any sign of a creepy soul walking towards her. They do try as they enforce the obvious sexual crime theme which is found with most independent horrors. A Scene at the end where they put her in the pool to lure the ghost in is foolish as it should have been the ideal time to get one of the friends possessed and create an ""It could be one of us?"" style scare. I personally found this to be a good effort but unfortunately didn't prosper to anything more than that."

","It Follows. The perfect title to understand this brilliant horror flick - two words that sum up all the great tense moments of this film with a clear explanation.<br/><br/>The premise - this supernatural figure follows you. There is only one of it, it only walks and never runs, and it will kill you. It can look like anybody and only people who have ""had it"" can see it. Why does it follow? If somebody who ""has it"" has sex with you, they pass it on (a likely metaphor for STD's) and you become the new target.<br/><br/>It may sound really simple, but that is the beauty of it. It follows you wherever you go, but it has a slow pace, not unlike a zombie. It follows you in a straight path and kills you if it has the chance to get close to you. What is creepier than basically being stalked and having no idea when your stalker will get to you?<br/><br/>What helps induce horror in the audience is the techno, heavy-bass style music not unlike the music in horror classic Halloween by John Carpenter. It really sets the tone for the film, and has an eerie feel to it, which keeps reminding you that there is something wrong and disturbing with this world.<br/><br/>Trust issues are a heavy theme in this film and understandably so. The main character ""gets it"" from a guy she goes on a few dates with, but he explains the situation to her in order to warn her and help get her out of the situation. Guys she knows want to protect her and take ""it"" away from her, but she is hesitant on letting certain people have it, especially her good friend Paul. On a couple occasions, however, characters attempt to pass it on to complete strangers - they would have no regrets if strangers die because of them. The idea of sexuality can, and should be discussed in great detail when analyzing this film.<br/><br/>Is it a perfect film? No. I believe it is very difficult to make a ""perfect"" horror movie, but this one keeps you on the edge of your seat while simultaneously making you question the idea of sex, making for a great, layered horror movie.<br/><br/>3.5/4.0"

","!SPOILER! ish. *Tried to avoid doing spoilers and making vague references to what happens without going into detail of any of them, so it's relatively safe to read if you haven't watched the movie, but if you want to go in completely fresh then.....* <br/><br/>So I saw people praising this film as intelligent and smart, and to that I say...no. Rather ironically, it falls apart the moment you stop to think about it instead of immersing yourself in the now without thinking about the 'it' and 'it's rules. The moment you do though.....<br/><br/>So the movie is essentially about supernatural STDs, a bit of oversimplification here, but that's what it boils down to to. The main character has to get rid of the very deadly Ghostherpes by passing it off to someone else.<br/><br/>Now heres the rub, the movies gives us some very vague rules as to how 'It' operates, but you, as the audience put yourself in the hoes of the character and begin to strategise, and to find a way to live. Unfortunately, the characters in the movie don't really do this. They barely think ahead, and I can only think of a single instance in the movie where they tried to beat it.<br/><br/>But then the rules are rather nebulous and vague anyway, I mean you contract it by sex, what penetration, does oral sex count? What about lesbian sex(strap-ons, yes/no?), gay sex, or does oral count? How does it work in orgies, does 'it' have to go through the entire group of persons to get back to you? And about travel, so it walks everywhere right? Does it walk under the ocean, does it fly, can it float, can you not simply sleep with a Japanese business man, someone from Sweden, someone from India, and a prostitute from Thailand, and you'd be safe for the rest of your life? Or simply go to another country? Or just do a roundstate trip, keeping just ahead of him like a not quite green Banner banging every you come across? Harder for a guy to pull off, but much easier for a gorgeous and young lead lady.<br/><br/>And apparently it's a physical manifestation as well, and seemingly intelligent, but it can be slowed down by bullets, so does this mean it can be blown apart, or captured? Now you may or may not think of any of these things, but of the 5 or 6 characters within this film, all they've managed to come up with is running off to some place not very far away and try to take it out in a well.....well it's something a plan a 12 year old would come up with to be honest.<br/><br/>So the movie does kind of end up being the sort of dumb supernatural horror movie, where thinking too much can hurt it, but if you don't do that, immerse yourself in the atmosphere, and if you can stomach the music(it wont be for everyone) and are cool with the slow pace reminiscent of older horror movies, then this may be for you.<br/><br/>The idea itself is a good one, but the rules and severe lack of imagination beyond the core idea, and the characters' within the film hurt it a bit I feel. You can have a simple yet elegant idea, but your simple idea needs to be solid as well."
"ArchonCinemaReviews","6","2","10","9 May 2015"," Stylistically beautiful and distinct - It Follows is not quite horrifying
","David Robert Mitchell should be proud of his accomplishments with It Follows - a moody and stylish horror that welcomes him to the film making scene.<br/><br/>It Follows has a promising premise and the direction of its screenwriter and director David Robert Mitchell shows a passion and vision for details. As a horror, It Follows fails to scare and is more of a highlight reel for Mitchell's cinematic resume.<br/><br/>In It Follows, a young woman named Jay (Maika Monroe) is kidnapped after a sexual encounter with a boy and told that she has now been passed a malevolent entity that will follow her, and if it catches her, kill her. The only way to save herself is to pass it on to someone else. Jay tries elude the force without dooming another soul, imploring her friends to help save her from the thing that predatorily lurks in the shadows.<br/><br/>The entire foundation of the film's presence, an evil being that follows you long after a sexual encounter, feels very much sponsored by some uber-Christian organization for abstinence propaganda. This vibe is not necessarily a bad thing in terms of the film's experience upon the viewer, just an observation of the myriad subtext one can take from the movie's plot.<br/><br/>Stylistically and cinematically, It Follows is a dream – the influences from which director David Robert Mitchell pulls for this movie are clear and distinct. Burgeoning film makers and photography aficionados will take note of the artistry in the purposeful framing and perspective of certain scenes and the tone of the overall film.<br/><br/>David Robert Mitchell still has much to learn in terms of story telling as the horror and terror never truly bubbles to the surface. Slow to a fault, it seem unimaginable that a film this painstakingly paced would resort only to exposition to reveal the plot. Had the viewer also been on a journey to discover the being, rather than a third party spectator, this film would have propelled Mitchell to the A leagues.<br/><br/>Regardless, we at Archon Cinema Reviews are very excited for what is next for Mitchell and what is sure to be a promising career.<br/><br/>Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases."

","1. Fantastic storyline. Really makes you think. 2. Orgasm-worthy cinematography. 3. The score for this thing I even downloaded. And I RARELY download film scores. It is so different to other 'horror-film' soundtracks. 4. Very little jump scares. 5. This film alone is not enough. It's so interesting, we NEED a sequel. 6. For once, in a 'horror film' the characters don't do cliché things like 'return just to check if he's dead and OOPS - he's alive, and no longer where you left him'. Instead, they do the things we ALL would do in a similar situation. 7. Solid script and likable/realistic characters. The location and settings suit the plot yet do not fall in to the typical 'scary house' settings. 8. Does not rely on gore. The beautiful cinematography alone is enough to keep us watching, well past the first few credits have started to roll. 9. Unlike most horror films, this film feels so fresh and for fans of the genre, it really does breathe new life into it. I don't know why it isn't rated higher or why it hasn't received more exposure. It deserves it. 10. I couldn't think of a tenth. You just need to watch it."
"Sabata101","10","2","11","29 April 2016"," 'You don't believe me do you?'
","Easily one of the best and most original films of the last decade, it's actually the best horror film I've seen in years. I think fans of popular, jump scare horror will tend to find It Follows fairly dull and bizarre, but to people who love slow burning, suspenseful, well made film, this is as good as they come. The synopsis is simple, a young woman finds herself 'infected' by a curse passed on to her from sex, which in term can then be passed on to someone else by sleeping with them. The curse involved being followed by an unknown entity, taking the form of a stranger in a crowd or someone you know, but wherever you are, no matter how far away you are from it, it will follow. Personally, I find this concept absolutely terrifying. <br/><br/>The portrayal of Jay, the lead, and her small circle of friends, is extremely believable and well acted. Nothing anyone does seems stupid, or without reason. Even the not so bright things they do (maybe the pool scene) is fairly justified, they're scared, desperate and young.<br/><br/>The real factor that puts It Follows above the rest though is the cinematography and atmosphere. The film is absolutely dripping in dreamlike dread. The chalky colours of American suburbia, the shots of childlike imagery, the fact the seasons and timing don't quite make sense, the soft light and absence of adult supervision, the long wide angle shots and setting of a decaying Detroit. All these create an unnerving, nightmarish situation where nothing is quite how it should be. It's basically like one long moving Gregory Crewdson image, and coupled with the fact a demon is constantly following the main character, the concept is downright frightening.<br/><br/>On par with It Follows' cinematography is its score. Produced by Disasterpeace it's one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. I actually own this on vinyl (which looks as good as it sounds) and it's just flawless. Clearly influenced (much like the film) by 80's horror such as Halloween, its a pulsating ride of unsettling ambiance, harsh, vibrating drones and heavy synths; dull bleeps & desolate keys. It bumps up the unsettling factor by about 80%.<br/><br/>The combination of It Follows' score, acting, cinematography and unbelievable atmosphere make it a must watch for fans of real horror and surreal film. Its gorgeous and dreamlike, but also utterly terrifying and very, very unnerving."
"bowmanblue","8","2","11","5 August 2015"," It really is pretty good
","I really do hate using someone else's words when it comes to reviewing a film, however the phrase 'It really does breathe new life into the horror genre' does seem – almost – applicable. Okay, it may be overstating the film's brilliance. It's no work of art, but, if you enjoy your horror yarns (and are as sick and tired of every new horror film using 'found footage' as a tool with which to scare us) then you may at least want to give this one the time of day.<br/><br/>It's long been a cliché in horror films that if you have sex you die (notably pointed out in the 'Scream' films), so it may come as a surprise that our lovely, blonde female lead manages to jump into bed (or a car, technically) within the first few scenes. Granted, she's not immediately bludgeoned to death by an ice hockey mask-wearing maniac, but her new boyfriend does have some bad news for her (and he's not just confessing that he's actually married!). He informed her that he's 'passed on' more than just something she needs to report to the doctors about.<br/><br/>An evil spirit/presence is now destined to follow her everywhere she goes until she dies. Or should that be until the evil spirit/presence in question murders her horribly? Either way, she has two options: sit around and wait for the grisly end, or 'pass it on' (and we all know what she has to do in order to get rid of it!).<br/><br/>However, seeing as our stricken heroine is a nice girl, she doesn't want to 'pass it on' or wait for the end. So she enlists the help of some of her mates and, together, they set about doing their best to make this spirit wish it had picked on someone else.<br/><br/>And, it's a pretty enjoyable ride. For a start, the title 'It Follows' is nicely applicable titles. The spook does just that. It never runs, it just walks. Not only does that give the victim a decent chance at escaping, but it does play on the psychological horror of having something totally unstoppable which never gives up until it has killed you. Plus the cast is good. Most horrors since the seventies have had a cast of youngsters and most of the time they're pretty bland and annoying (or just put there for the offending killer to pick off one by one). However, here the friends interact quite nicely and come across as a believable bunch.<br/><br/>'It Follows' has been successful, therefore it's pretty much guaranteed to be the start of a franchise. And, with most horror franchises, I dare say that the quality will drop with each one until it's ultimately rebooted. So, before the quality diminishes completely, I say watch the original quickly before your memory of the story is overshadowed by countless spin-offs, sequels and remakes. It's actually pretty good if you're already into your horror. Plus it's a nice take on the 'have-sex-and-die' horror premise!"
"MattyAndAnnika","7","2","11","10 August 2015"," not a bad find
","It Follows (2015) is actually not a bad independent film. This movie plays well on the old school eerie thrill horror, and has a really nice story line to go with that style. It's for sure low budget and it happen to pull off a really cool movie and I'm sure movie fans of this style of thriller/horror can enjoy it. The acting in this film was pretty well done and the graphics were even better than I would've thought.<br/><br/>It Follows was put together with a small cast and an even smaller crew and yet pulled off a fairly well made horror story. It's a story that makes you think, and at the same time when ya think about it; well it's kind of funny. When I watched this film I started thinking about the old horror films like Halloween, Friday 13th, and others along this film styling; very well played. So if you're up for a fairly good thriller then check this one out; it'll surprise you."

There were really no special effects to dazzle you. Cant compare to The Ring or the Grudge for creepiness and scariness. Could have been a lot scarier. It was more of an old school creep out rather than a gross out or a blood-fest. It didn't have any surprise jump out of your seat scares.

","A young woman (Maika Monroe) is followed by an unknown supernatural force after getting involved in a sexual encounter.<br/><br/>This film hit hard with intense hype, and created two camps: a larger, more positive camp that loved the hype and the film. And a smaller camp, who were disappointed and thought it was much ado about nothing. While it would be hard to say that one side was right and one was wrong (we all have opinions), the larger camp seems to be winning.<br/><br/>And why not? We have a fresh, new idea here played out with great actors and some creepy effects. Beyond the involvement of Robert Kurtzman, this was almost completely a cast and crew of people whose names are not going to ring bells in the horror community. But they will now, because many people were terrified. There is something about a creature that slowly stalks that can be far more terrifying than the in-your-face machete-wielder.<br/><br/>Most clever is the concept that after the creature (or virus or whatever) is passed on, it could still return to kill you if it kills the next person in line. This makes the task of avoiding it so much more difficult. You could pass it along, but five years later, just as you calm down and get back to a normal routine... bam! It has worked through the chain back to you! <br/><br/>Worth singling out is the score from Disasterpiece (Rich Vreeland), Jeff Szpirglas has called a ""nifty fusion"" of John Carpenter and Krzysztof Penderecki. The music is one of the best things of the film, completing the hollow, lifeless mood of the setting. It moves in a simple, methodical direction, creating the tension that something is slowly creeping from a distance... or right behind you. That is pure, aural gold.<br/><br/>""It Follows"" is, without a doubt, the best horror film to be released in years, and perhaps the best of the 21st century so far."

Carpenter-esque. An intellectual horror movie. The bad guy could show up at anytime and the characters and viewers would never know we were with the bad guy. Heavy on 70s and 80s synthesized music.

","'It Follows' is frustrating in ways it is difficult to explain without giving away the plot. Suffice to say it takes the connection between Sex & Death in American teen-centred horror movies to a far more literal end than usual. Writer-Director David Robert Mitchell borrows a lot from '80s and early '90s – Carpenter's over-use of suburban steadi-cam and Lynch's love of the perfectly framed symmetrical establishing-shot and overlong extreme close-up, with occasional Cronenberg-like fascination in incidental details. The soundtrack – a smattering of discordant synthesized chords, whines and pops – is distinctly retro: retro Carpenter at his least musically imaginative. To its credit, it takes its time, establishing tension gradually, rather than leaping from one bloody set-piece to another in rapid succession, and there are occasional sparks of visual inventiveness. A shame, then, that so much of the cinematography is derivative. . It's trying to do something interesting with the trope of the relentless inhuman predator, but largely fails. Partly this because it is too mainstream for the art- house crowd and too arty for the multiplex (those people want more gore). The who, why and what of the predator are completely avoided, which adds to the tension and anxiety of the characters – of whom only Maika Monroe, the female lead, seems emotionally invested in proceedings – but makes the internal-logic of the horror franchise (and you just KNOW this is going to be a franchise) difficult to fathom."

Features the most boring group of teenagers ever to exist, played by the most boring group of teenager actors ever to exist. Everyone speaks in monotone and generally looks like they are sleepwalking in every scene.
Let's talk about the monster (monster? ghost? demon?). The concept is cool and almost scary until you realize he (she? it?) is pointless just like the entire movie. At least It Follows, right? Well, sometimes it does, most of the times it simply does not. Does not stop the camera from filming some empty place where the monster is SUPPOSED to be, but sadly it is slow af so it probably can't make it there for another half an our (actual screentime, not ""movie time"" half an our). Thinking about it, the only reason it is remotely dangerous because our sleepwalking lead never takes any precaution to avoid it. Aside from trying to sleep with every man in the movie just to pass it on. Even so, this movie makes sex look like a tragedy, but in reality it is the movie itself."

This just is not a good movie, plain and simple. Anybody that says this is a good movie clearly knows nothing about what does and does not make for a good film. I saw one moron say that if you don't like this movie, its because you only like horror movies that make you ""jump"". Actually, I prefer horror movies that create real fear as opposed to ones that try to scare you with loud noises and sudden movements. I loved the movie ""The Babadook"" because their were 3 scenes that sent chills down my spine without trying to make me jump at all.<br/><br/>But ""It Follows"" is just not scary at all. The only thing slightly frighening was the appearances of a couple of the forms ""It"" takes on. On top of not being scary, its just not a well put-together movie. There are some really poor transitions from one scene to the next, characters make decisions that make little or no sense, and a few scenes just made me wonder ""what the hell is going on in this movie right now??""<br/><br/>The only reason I didn't give this movie a 1/10 is that, unfortunately, there are bigger pieces of crap out there (see ""The Invitation"" or ""Open House).

","I enjoyed some if not most of the scenes in this movie, although the storyline seemed to make little sense. The character were completely hollow and I didn't care about them at all.<br/><br/>The basic plot from what I can gather is some middle class American girl catches a disease or a curse or something along those lines from having sex with a stranger, then just about everything after that revolves around sex.<br/><br/>This is the type of movie that I call a zzz-fest, meaning that it's good to put on if you want something to fall asleep to, because you really wont care what happens at the end its presented in such a boring fashion."

","It follows. Wherever you go, it's going, too. It can be everyone. A stranger. A friend. Even family. And if it follows you once, it will follow you to your death.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning you know that 'It Follows' is not a typical Horror movie. Without further explanation, the movie pushes you right into the action, which in the eye of the ignorant audience might seem weird but yet arouses curiosity. Even though the concept is simple, the movie is terrifying throughout. Just like ""It"" comes slowly but surely closer, the movie itself has a slow build up which in the end results in a well-made climax. The menacing atmosphere throughout the movie is endorsed by a fitting stress-producing cinematography. But 'It Follows' is despite one or another jump scare in no way a shallow horror-shocker, but rather offers a lot of hidden subtext for every Hobby movie-analyzer. Admittedly, one or two jump scares are in the movie, but combined with a well-build tension they make ones hair stand on end. The movie plays with simple fears, but also provides a threatening nature, that enthralls everyone. Not only the protagonists will develop some kind of paranoia but also the viewer will find himself scanning the setting of the movie more precisely. You will inevitably be thrilled every second of this movie and even try for yourself to find away out of this hopeless situation. Sadly some questions will stay unanswered but that doesn't hurt the movie in any way. In my opinion every great horror movie needs this kind of mysteriousness and perplexity in the end.<br/><br/>'It Follows' is a movie for every horror lover. Without any unnecessary shockers or disgusting elements, the movie offers a atmospherically threatening experience that will take everybody's breath away. A lot of hidden subtext and symbolism draws through 'It Follows', which provides the movie depth, that you rarely see in other horror movies. 'It Follows' is an example, that others would do well to follow."

","After sleeping with her new boyfriend, a woman finds herself targeted by an unseen, unstoppable menace intent on killing her as part of a strange condition that he passed onto her, and must convince her friends to help her fight it off in order to survive.<br/><br/>Overall this one here was quite the enjoyable if slightly flawed effort. What really gets the most work out of this one is the unbelievably creative and enveloping backstory laid out for the killer here, and is undoubtedly one of the most engaging parts conceived. Utilizing the concept of the stalking figure only she can see and react to, endlessly pursuing her only and not changing until she sleeps with someone else and all starting because of someone passing it to her through sexual activity is a rather strong, unique concept that is a truly modern and engrossing concept that plays so well into the scope of modern-day viewpoints on sexuality and paranoia that it works so well because of how it plays on those tropes. Having her be the only one really capable of seeing it and responding to its advances that there's plenty of suspense derived from that ability alone in some truly stand-out, spectacular scenes here starting with her realization of the situation at the garage or seeing the old woman approaching her at the school which really sets this one going along incredibly nicely in a strong set of suspense scenes that set this one in motion. Even some of the other big sequences, from the break-in at her house during the sleepover where she sees the figure coming for her but the others are unaware of it's presence, the absolutely spectacular attack at the beach-house where everyone finally becomes aware of what's going on with her and the stellar sequence at her friends' house that finally shows what potentially happens when the being catches up with her. There's a lot to like about all of these elements coming together here that allows for a great set-up into the finale where they launch the assault against it at the pool with some rather clever and ingenious methods of fighting and attacking it. These here do make this one engaging enough that there's a lot to like here though it does tend to have a few minor flaws on display. The biggest issue here is the film's loss of focus once it gets to the second half of the story. Once it lets the group in on what's going on and that something is indeed after her, there's a lull in action that lets a lot of air out of the film as it struggles to get to the big revealing showdown between the two yet there's never a strong sense of action that comes from here. It's all pretty much a toned down series of chases that don't really have the impact of the first half and makes the film feel a little overlong at that point. As well, the other minor issue is undoubtedly the lack of detail given the threat which is understandable given the nature of the set-up but this could've still had a few questions resolved. From how it winds through it's hit-list, how it was summoned and why no one but it's target can see it should've been at least mentioned if not explained, and in general that's little about it that's known overall and it does feel like a cheat. Otherwise this one was a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Full Nudity, strong sexual content including continuous sexual themes and drug use."
"damianrgbg","7","1","4","19 December 2015"," a highly thrilling experience
","This movie makes many things right. First of all it must be said that the main idea of the movie is nicely chosen. Yes, there are some movies which have a similar idea. But ""It follows"" mixes those ideas up and combines them to a new entertaining style of horror. So actually the movie isn't really that innovative, like many people pretend. It is rather how the movie is made, it's about the entertainment. Scary music, combined with a very well proportioned amount of jump-scares and visual-scares. Between those scares the movie doesn't get boring, because the director manages that the viewers are afraid nearly in the same level like the protagonists. Why that? It's because of those scares which are really intensively done. The viewer is just afraid of the next scare, because the viewer knows that it will come for sure, and is waiting it to happen. It could happen in any moment and in every place. So it must be said that the thrill goes non-stop throughout the whole movie. The main aspect which must be criticized is that the protagonists behave really stupid. As a viewer you ask yourself: wait, why doesn't she do this or that? But if you search an entertaining and highly thrilling movie (it's less a horror, i would rather call it a thriller with some horror-like moments), then this is the one you need to watch."
"sddavis63","7","1","4","26 November 2015"," Appropriately Creepy
","On the creepiness factor - which is probably the most important element in a movie like this - ""It Follows"" works brilliantly. For me, what has made a lot of teen horror movies major disappointments is that they've settled into little more than blood and gore fests, where you spend most of your time waiting for the next kid to bite the dust. But a lot of those movies lack the proper atmosphere. This one sets that mood of creepiness over gore right from the start; the moment when Jay (Maika Monroe) wakes up bound and confined to a wheelchair in a parking lot, while the guy she had just had sex with and who chloroformed her after (which was a twist in itself) explains that the sex passed on a curse to her that she could only rid herself of by having sex with someone else. And ""it"" - the curse - stalks her for the rest of the movie, as her friends try to help her.<br/><br/>It's a pretty simple plot, and it worked well. Nothing about the curse (except how to get rid of it) was ever explained. It was just a mystery, and that lack of understanding just heightened everything. For this kind of movie, there was surprisingly little nudity, and almost no blood. Instead - surprise - the movie revolved around an actual story, which was very refreshing. On an entirely different level, you could look at this as a warning about the potential danger of casual sex, I suppose.<br/><br/>Monroe's performance as Jay was very convincing, and the musical score quite effective. I did keep scratching my head wondering where all these kids' parents were. Or perhaps that was another subtle warning - this one about the danger of absentee parents. <br/><br/>Basically, very well done all round. One of the better horror movies made in recent years.

","(Very marginal spoilers) This fiasco should have been titled ""Vagina of Death."" It's the fitful mating of the threadworn sluts-die-first slasher grindhouse flick with a slow-paced, fatalistic Japanese ghost story. The result is a turgid, glacial, irritating allegory about a malevolent demon passed on through sex (only of the traditional male-female type, apparently), with a heavy- handed message that seems to have been conceived by the Catholic League: Sure it sucks being an adolescent, dealing with angst and uncertainty, full of raging hormones and the fear of death. But kids, sex will not put distance between you and your fears; rather, it will bring death closer, along with a host of other problems. The consequences of lust will follow you everywhere: emotional turmoil, unwanted pregnancy, disease, vaginal chafe, whatever.<br/><br/>Even Detroit is exploited to illustrate this theme. See kids, even cities decline and die, sooner or later, without your clean, white, suburban values (though it's not clear whether or not the decline had anything specifically to do with its lusting after Windsor). See the crumbling buildings and beaten-down prostitutes? Dirty sex and decay!<br/><br/>But, since this is a mainstream, commercial flick, we want to have our thrills before we repent. And sure nuff, along the way to having our moral fiber cleaned and pressed, there's scene after scene of mopey teens going at it--in cars, hospitals beds, and horrifically furnished homes (in fact, the interior decorating may be the scariest thing in this turkey). Look kids, here's exactly what you shouldn't be doing. Doesn't that look deliciou- er uh disgusting!? Here it is again in a different position. Here it is with MOM -- ewww!! Now are you convinced that this is a nasty, life-sucking diversion!?<br/><br/>Ultimately, even the lust is not very lusty. A talented cast tries gamely to keep this leaky boat afloat (Keir Gilchrist comes off best, convincingly relaying scores of specific thoughts with only his face and eyes) but mostly there's little for them to do but look confused, frightened, and skimpily dressed for two very long hours. Trust me, it's even longer for the audience. At least the cast was paid to go through it."

",""" The scariest American horror film in years"" and if you're coming out with hyperbole like that you'd better have a damn good movie to go with that type of marketing . That is until you stop to consider that America has been seriously on the back foot when it comes to the horror genre in the last decade and is content to do either horror porn or remakes . I'm wracking my brains and I think the last American horror film to impress me was THE MIST and that was made about seven or eight years ago . On top of that if a mere horror film comes with hype it usually ruins it for me . I thought THE BABADOOK was okay but again that was hyped to high heaven which meant my expectations weren't really matched with the feedback it received from others . IT FOLLOWS has the same sort of acclaim that I instinctively thought would work against it <br/><br/>!!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!! <br/><br/>To be fair writer/director David Robert Mitchell knows how to draw in an audience and opens the film with a good hook - a young woman exits her house obviously terrified and a couple of minutes later the plot thread comes to a conclusive end with a stark , chilling image . From the outset the film shows that it's not a studio picture and it has independent roots which I'm happy to see the likes of the Academy Awards recognise the spirit of independent movie making even if they're hardly likely to hand out nominations and awards to horror movies . Don't get me wrong , I'm not saying IT FOLLOWS should have been up for Best Picture . I'm just saying independent is much more respected these days <br/><br/>One thing Mitchell seems to have borrowed from greatly is the MR James story Casting The Runes adapted for cinema in 1957 under the name NIGHT OF THE DEMON and here we see a similar type of story featuring an adolescent girl with sex used as a plot device . It's a reworking of the ""horny teenagers in peril"" but works very well for the most part . I say for the most part because the pacing isn't brilliant but Mitchell brings a brooding creepy atmosphere to the film and is helped by good use of amorphous music and when the horror parts happen they rather unsettling . In short it's a fairly good film but the downside is tags such as""Horror masterpiece"" and ""Scariest film in years"" possibly raise expectations just that little bit too high"

","""It Follows"" has one of the most refreshing premises in a horror movie I've seen in years. <br/><br/>The premise is nightmarish in the idea that when you become cursed after having sex with someone else who has been cursed, you become relentlessly followed by an unknown entity (without warning or reason) who's only goal is seemingly to kill you. Reminiscent of ""The Thing"" the unknown entity can take any shape or any form of another human being. <br/><br/>The idea is nightmarish just the thought of being followed by ""it"" is enough to give someone paranoia walking down the street at night by themselves.<br/><br/>HOWEVER and a big however at that, the film is marred by typical horror clichés, a loss in all plot and back story about ""It"", and sci-fi channel-esque SFX that bring the movies quality down immensely.<br/><br/>Clichés such as teenage characters running in the forest by themselves at night, or walking towards sounds that the evil entity is clearly making, is just frustrating to watch now, especially when the premise of the story is so great. Really ""it"" walks at a very slow lumbering pace that can easily be avoided with a light jog or even power walk. After the 2nd encounter the formula just gets old, girl sees monster, loses it, and runs away. I would have loved to seen the characters sit down and really plan out ways to evade the entity, or even ways to study its behavior. It doesn't seem like it would be something thats too hard to even capture.<br/><br/>The SFX are also notably abysmal. Whether it be blood effects and splatter, or even gun smoke coming out of a fired handgun, they're so bad they completely break immersion and is almost laughable. In fact towards the end of the movie I lost that sense of paranoia and really did just start laughing and shaking my head in the theater.<br/><br/>Want to make a movie that works as a homage to old 80's slasher and horror films? Lose the SFX and move on to costumes and props. Please.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that the soundtrack was the movies one redeemable quality, hands down Disasterpeace did a great job.<br/><br/>IN SHORT: What started as a very promising, captivating, and unique story, turned into a mess of teenage characters behaving like typical brainless horror movie protagonists, and a loss of all back story (and story in general) i was anticipating so much to hear about. <br/><br/>5/10 for the soundtrack and premise alone.

The acting is more or less great and the synthetic-sounding score is phenomenal and really fits with the tone of the film.

","Initially, from my viewing of the initial trailer for the movie, I had felt like this might be a thin, silly metaphor for STDs, but seeing how much more complex and fabulous this movie is, I'm pretty happy to say right here at the start, that you need to get out and see this movie if you're able. Right now.<br/><br/>I have so much to say about this, but I also don't want to get too deep into the story details, so I'll sum of the story elements briefly first, and then get into the rest of things that I loved about this. The story is tense, interesting and, with the exception of a couple of silly ""horror moments"", kept me guessing and wondering. It really does a great job of balancing the ""show don't tell"" method that is always effective in horror movies, with some genuinely chilling moments from start to finish.<br/><br/>The movie is shot beautifully, the cinematography drags you in by the face, and forces you to join these characters in the nightmare they are living in. Not only is it incredibly effective at deeply immersing you in the world, but may of the shots are genuinely beautiful, and really work to create a haunting world. There are a lot of moments throughout that leave everything up to your interpretation of how events unfold, and really add some depth to an already hugely engaging movie.<br/><br/>On top of the cinematography, you have probably one of the most oppressive and fantastic soundtracks ever. I immediately thought of movies like Drive, and even some of John Carpenter's soundtracks, terms of effectiveness. Some elements even gave me the same sensation that the final scene of Requiem For A Dream did, and they added so much to the movie. Some of the scenes are unbearably tense, and the soundtrack just pushes you right over the edge.<br/><br/>On top of everything, we have hugely likable characters played by really wonderful actors. There wasn't anyone in this movie who didn't really do a great job. Each actor seemed to fit really well, and it brought that much more to the movie. Everything about the movie felt very intimate, and these characters really worked for me. Maika Monroe (The Guest) is so great, and carries the movie really well. I also found everyone else really likable, and even felt like the characters were written as real people, and not like what movies want male and female characters to be. Hell, one of the female characters casually rips a fart in her introduction and it's laughed off in the same way as it would had it been a male character. It's a little thing, but I really did appreciate it.<br/><br/>There's a lot of small details in this movie that really stood out to me, and made me wonder about the reality of the movie all the way through, it's subtle, and intense, and just so so so so great.<br/><br/>This is easily the best movie I've seen so far this year, and I have a feeling will be making its way on to plenty of top 10 lists when 2016 rolls around. Get out and see it as soon as you can, if you can still see it in theaters, then do it. Stop sorting through the garbage pile of 2015 direct-to-streaming/DVD releases and get on this bandwagon already."
"rlaine","9","1","5","16 December 2015"," A modern retro horror movie hits the spot
","In short, I loved it! I'm a bit of a horror movie fan, but most of all a movie fan. Even a geek. This movie is good on many levels.<br/><br/>There's a quick introduction, which leaves quite a few things to be answered. Once you figure out what's going on, it's quite mind tingling. The plot does fall a bit out of pace here and there, but it keeps interesting all the way to the credits. At modest 90 minutes, it's actually quite a slow movie, but that's a good thing here. Gives you time to think, without getting boring. Many times I was just looking at the casts small expressions, looks and loving the fact that the movie doesn't spoon feed everything. There are a few scenes with a bit more action and jumpy scares, which in my opinion don't all work as well as the more slow sections. At one point ""It"" kind of gets out of character in my opinion, just for the sake of ""being scary"".<br/><br/>As a horror movie it's quite effective. There's not much gore (goriest images are in the beginning) and relatively few jump scares. But the tone of the movie is grim. No jokes, nothing is funny. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful and builds a great atmosphere. The same can be said for the most part about the soundtrack too, which is quite 80s inspired synth driven - almost chillwave (without over compressed beats). There is one theme in the soundtrack tho that sticked out as almost like a parody. It's a bit too over the top and would better suit a Scary Movie kind of spoof. Otherwise it's perfect.<br/><br/>The acting is great. The cast was all unknown to me, but did very well. One nice touch is the timelessness of the movie. There is modern technology used, but for the most part it's quite timeless without being overly retro either (except maybe for the soundtrack). And the ending, I kept thinking how will they end this without it ruining the movie - and they didn't! It's as good as it can be.<br/><br/>A very pleasant surprise, but now that I read about this it has gathered good reviews and I don't wonder why. Recommended!"

","This one of those movies you see that you neither really like or hate. It has all the elements that make a scary movie, but it's just plain not scary. The acting was fine, cinematography and soundtrack were average at best. But there is a distinct lack of tension, and the pursuit scenes were unimaginative and repetitive. The monster shows up, chases the heroine, the heroine runs away, then spends 15 minutes talking with her friends about what's going on. Repeat this four or five times and you have this movie. One issue I had was how the man who gave the heroine the curse, seems to know all the rules, but doesn't explain how he knows them. I don't need to have everything explained to me, but this was confusing. A good idea, imaginative, but just so flat that there is no tension."

We would of felt more helpless and like one of the friends in the movie helpless and scared. IT didn't scare me or give me nightmares IT gave me questions and confusion mostly.

","Well, first off, I did not expect a release for this Indie locally, and when it happened, the first emotion is one of overwhelming grateful-ness. I also did not expect much of the nudity of the sex sequences to make it to the final cut, and I was right, but surprisingly, a few long shots of said nudity made it without them being blurred out, and few more mag snaps. Puzzling, but hopefully a sign of things to improve. Or not.<br/><br/>This one's been making the rounds for being the surprise Indie hit (actually, slightly better-than-average, if numbers are crunched accurately) this year, the way 'The Babadook' was. <br/><br/>Helmer David Robert Mitchell has a few credits, but other than a mixed bag review for 'The myth of the American sleepover', has really nothing to recommend him, other than this one.<br/><br/>Well, to the movie now: While I wholeheartedly recommend that this be viewing in cinemas, and have read glowing reviews for the same, there were so many why-in-blazes-did-they-do-that sequences that I feel that all the compliments are grossly overblown, making this one of the most overrated movies of this year. <br/><br/>+ The cinematography, complemented by some very able camera-work, that is very old-school, making the Michigan locations chosen to be pitch-perfect to film in and around. The old-school long shots as well, evokes old-school John Carpenter in more than one sequence.<br/><br/>+ The rules not being very clear (changing a tad, here and there) puts us firmly in the shoes of the possible vic, empathizing with their situation, and realistically not knowing where the menace is gonna spring from next, or what keeps it going, and for what reason, kinda keeping it all very grounded. The aspect of a literal level of Ctrl+Z happening with the rules on the death of a vic, where the 'force' zeroes back on the previous possible vic, is quite novel, and makes for a nice explanation on how the pre-title sequence came about.<br/><br/>+ The soundtrack by Disasterpeace. Old-school John Carpenter. Gonna purchase it soon. Fantastic. Overdone, overblown, and calls attention to itself, but simply superb and great. Long time since I've listened to such tracks. Not only evoked Carpenter's Halloween (for more than just its soundtrack or his style), but also Ridley Scott's 'Blade runner' for its Vangelis' score. Can't get it outta my head.<br/><br/>+ The casting and the performances. This team, might just go places. I've not seen even one of them earlier (something to do with not being in the US as well), and somehow I think that's gonna change.<br/><br/>MASSIVE SPOILERS below, and my conclusion beforehand:<br/><br/>A movie worth watching on the big screen, and my rants on the movie's minuses need never detract from that. However, for a movie that wants to be taken seriously, there are quite a few loopholes, that hopefully might get fixed in the sequel being planned. <br/><br/><ul><li>The surprising way in which one of the main characters keeps it together while 'passing it on', while, in hindsight, indicates that he/she has done it before, doesn't ring true with the rest of his/her characterization about the same aspect. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The number of times, as I mentioned previously, that I was wondering why certain characters did what they did, that dialed up the stupidity quotient (wayyy up) to a great extent, and literally caused whiplash with the way the rest of the movie screamed to be considered 'smart'. Ouch.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The same conceit was used to much, much better effect in Hoblit's 'Fallen', where there was a logical conceit to the central conceit, and the final completely-off-left-field twist ending also gave it a level of respect hitherto not given to mainstream horror/thriller, while keeping the entire flick completely-grounded.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Where were the parents?

","Indie horror film that's actually playing at mainstream cinemas. It's about a teenage girl who has sex with a guy she just met. Then he tells her she's marked for death. She'll see people walking to her and, if they get her, will kill her. The catch is no one else can see them--only her. The only way to get rid of this is to have sex with someone else and it will pass on to them.<br/><br/>The premise is certainly original and the film is well-done but some critics are acting like this is a masterpiece. It's good but not THAT good. It's was shot on location in Detroit and took advantage of the run-down part of the city. Everything looks grimy and dingy perfectly setting the tone for the movie. Also there's an eerie and impressive music score that really helps. Also there's only one jump scare and not much blood or gore at all. There are also two sequences which scared me silly. The acting is, at best, OK. No one is terrible but no one is really good either.<br/><br/>The main problem here is that the movie is too laid-back. These teenagers take everything way too casually--even when they start being attacked or are killed. It sort of mutes the movie. Still it works more often than it doesn't. I give it a 7."

","I am never taking user reviews seriously on IMDb again after this disaster of a viewing! This could have been a good thriller/suspense film if anything at any point in this mess had been explained properly. The movie has a simple premise:girl meets boy,they go out on a date and then after having sex in his car he tells her that ""it"" will be coming for her soon and ""it"" can look like anybody. He advises her to sleep with someone asap to pass the curse along and to pretty please not let it kill her or it will come back after him. That and the rambling opening scene of a scared girl running from something only she can see and subsequently turning up brutally murdered on a beach are all the hints you ever get about what the hell ""it"" is. The whole other hour and a half before the non-ending is just literally pointless dramatic music and the girl and her friends trying to stay ahead of ""it"". Since the thing just seems to walk after her slowly in one human body or another (sometimes decaying and sometimes nice and fresh) ""it"" isn't even sort of scary. Just granny ambling in her nightgown or a little kid with a vacant expression shuffling down the sidewalk etc. The motive of the being is never explained nor does the film actually have a ending... besides just randomly ending after a bunch of nothing. So basically, confusing opening, confusing (and super boring) middle..and no end. No plot. No big reveal.Boring,almost inanimate characters who barely talk..and all these ringer reviews talking about how ""smart"" this movie was. Unless you just want the ambient background noise of your TV playing this movie while you take a two hour nap I would highly suggest watching ANYTHING else you can."
"Coventry","6","1","6","15 September 2015"," Relax, it's just sex Or is it?
","I'll admit that my main motivation to see ""It Follows"" was probably the wrong one I didn't necessarily want to see it because it's labeled as one of the freshest, most original and genuinely frightening American horror movies of recent years, but I watched it because I was literally sick and tired of reading how everybody is talking about this movie on film forums! In the message boards section of this lovely website, for example, there are – without exaggerating – ten discussions going on about ""It Follows"" on a daily basis and I got really fed up with avoiding all of them in order not to read any spoilers. Usually when a certain horror film is trending or being the hype of the moment, I postpone my personal viewing so that I can't get influenced too much by the opinions of others. There just isn't coming an end to the hype that is called ""It Follows"" around here on the message boards. Since 7-8 months non-stop already, everybody shouts out his/her opinion and most of them are very positive and enthusiastic. And is ""It Follows"" really worthy of all this interactive attention and mouth-to-mouth publicity? No, of course not I don't think that any film should receive this much exposure, in fact, except maybe in case Alfred Hitchcock would rise from his grave and direct ""Psycho V: Happy Mother's Day"". <br/><br/>But hey, at the same time I will gladly admit that ""It Follows"" quite a few positive aspects going for it. More positive than negative ones, in fact. The basic plot concept is original as well as unsettling, the soundtrack and several unexpected scenes are genuinely petrifying and most of the lead protagonists come across as authentic and identifiable young adults. The successful combination of all these aspects already makes ""It Follows"" a dozen times better than the vast majority of US-horror releases nowadays, since most of them are either redundant remakes or lame direct-to-DVD zombie comedies. The cute and friendly girl-next-door Jay Height thinks that she found happiness with her hunky new boyfriend Hugh. However, after they made love for the first time in the backseat of his cool car, everything changes abruptly. It seems as if Hugh was only looking for a victim to physically pass on a terrible kind curse. Since the sex, Jay gets stalked by nightmarish entities and ghastly figures. Jay's closest friends want to help, but naturally no one else sees the entities that she sees, and passing it on herself via casual sex doesn't necessarily make her safe. So, the idea is very good and the handful of genuine shock/fright moments likewise, but sadly the film also contains far too many boring and pointless footage. Writer/director David Robert Mitchell often undercuts the suspense by overlong dialogs and extended scenes of absolutely nothing. Unfortunately he also knows that his script is fairly clever, so several twists (especially near the finale) feel somewhat pretentious. Don't count on proper explanations either, of course. That being said, I would still definitely recommend horror genre fans to check out ""It Follows"", even if it were only for the downright fantastic soundtrack by Disasterpeace. The music fits the atmosphere and grisly images perfectly, and it's arguably the greatest horror score since John Carpenter's music for his own classic ""Halloween"". <br/><br/>By the way, I just had a daughter. In case this movie will stand the test of time and it becomes a cult classic, I will definitely show it to her in sixteen years or so. Before she starts dating and clubbing, just to make her think twice about random unsafe sex and one night stands; ha!"

","!!!spoilers!!! . But why would you read a review on a movie you've never watched? Go into movies blind!!! (who am i kidding, i do it all the time)<br/><br/>OK so the whole idea that is turning the gears of this movie is quite interesting. The whole idea of a sexually transmitted disease following you in physical form is quite terrifying and an effective visualization for what living with an std must feel like. At times i was on the edge of my seat and they do an excellent job of creating a slow build up at the beginning. Its almost a bit to slow because the ending feels a bit rushed. The introduction to ""IT"" and the scene where the young woman is at the hospital dreading each footstep she hears is quite terrifying. So i see why this movie was so hyped up.<br/><br/>Now I'd hate to do this but i will state my opinion because i feel there might be other people who feel the same way. The soundtrack was absolutely annoying at times. i dislike tech-no music, so hearing dragged out syn-th remixes of 80's melodies was a bit much, there was definitely times where they could of just used some normal piano keys and it seemed as if they wanted to absolutely show off these trendy syn-th grooves, i wasn't into it. Second, the characters were absolutely annoying, i don't know how people think they're relate-able. An annoying lead actress with a nasally voice and no personality, a peeping tom weirdo of a childhood best friend whose craziest childhood memory was finding a porno magazine, a duchy guy whose kissing one girl one day and then shagging the lead actress in a hospital bed with the door open while her best friends are asleep next to her the next, and then a cute nerdy chick who isn't annoying but whose pointless dialogs gets drowned out by syn-th music. I don't know about you but i didn't relate to them that much, i mean i guess when the nerdy chick farted i could relate because , you know, everyone passes gas. Anytime they were talking i wanted the intense tech-no with extreme bass music to start so that ""IT"" could come and kill them. And then if ""IT"" was such a merciless killer who could blend into society, why did ""IT"" make ""IT"" so obvious whenever ""IT"" was near? Well then, of course this is my opinion but the fact is that i was a bit let down, i was expecting something great when really it was an 80's slasher remix. Maybe I'm just butt hurt that i spent 25 dollars on the blue-ray release."

These are not good questions to leave the theater with. I suppose someone can and will supply those answers but I'd kinda like to have had a grasp on them during the movie rather than when I'm home hearing somebody explain this stuff to me while I nod and go ""uh huh"".

","It Follows (2014) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>A young woman (Maika Monroe) goes out on a date with a guy she just met and the two have sex. Soon she begins to have strange things follow her.<br/><br/>There's a lot more going on with IT FOLLOWS but the plot detail should be kept small so that spoilers won't ruin the movie. This is a hard film to discuss without going into spoilers but I'm going to give it a shot. Is IT FOLLOWS the most terrifying horror film ever made as some are claiming? Not even close. Is it something different than the typical horror film out there? There's certainly no question about that. Writer-director David Robert Mitchell has taken a fairly simple premise and brought all sorts of creepy moments that are certainly entertaining enough to make up for some of the flaws.<br/><br/>Again, I'm not going to go into great detail but we basically follow this woman around as she becomes more and more terrified because she keeps being followed by some unknown entity. At first her friends don't believe her but soon they too realize that something weird strange is going on and part of the fun in the film is trying to understand what's going on and why. For the most part I thought the screenplay did a very good job at keeping the viewer guessing as to what these things are following the woman and the entire time you're wondering how it's going to end. The film manages to have some very creepy moments scattered throughout and I especially liked how the movie started as we see what happens if you let these things catch you. I'm not going to spoil some of the bigger scares in the picture but there are times when the director puts you right in the middle of the action and makes you feel as if these things are coming after you.<br/><br/>The film features some wonderful cinematography by Mike Gioulakis and some great editing by Julio Perez IV. The film also benefits from some very good performances by the supporting cast but it's the lead, Maika Monroe, who really shines here. We've seen countless actresses play scared throughout the history of horror films but Monroe really leaves an impact. Even if she never appears in another horror film she's probably made herself so memorable here that they will be talking about her for years to come. She's really believable in the part and makes you feel as afraid she is. The sound effects are also a major plus here.<br/><br/>There are certainly some problems including it going on a tad bit too long in the final act. I think about ten-minutes less would have made for a tighter movie as things did start to repeat a bit too much. The music score by Rich Vreeland, on its own, is downright terrific and one of the most memorable in recent horror memory. It really reminded me of the scores Dario Argento used during his 80's films. The score was very loud and very much in your face and at times I thought it somewhat took away from what was going on on the screen but at other times it was quite fitting. There also appeared to be a brief nod to John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN theme.<br/><br/>IT FOLLOWS is certainly a flawed film but there are enough creepy moments to make it worth viewing."

","The reason I gave the movie such a bad review is because it had so much potential and, for the most part, was actually a fantastic horror film. For about the first half of the movie, I was genuinely creeped out. There were a lot of unnecessary shots of naked women and people having sex, but I was able to ignore those parts, so they only ruined the atmosphere a bit. It was an annoying, but unfortunately common enough occurrence in horror films for me to be used to it. However, at the climax of the film, the 'It' that has been following Jay the whole time catches up with Greg (who she, of course, had on-screen sex with). The fact that the film shows us what happens when it catches up to you removes a lot of the suspense and mystery of the concept- it makes the monster a lot less scary, because anything it does is infinitely less scary than anything the audience's imagination comes up with. But what's even worse than ruining the first rule of horror movies is the actual action it takes- apparently, this monster kills you by having sex with you. I'm not sure what I expected, but the moment the camera shows us Greg's mom and him together, the movie immediately lost any feeling of terror it had just because of the sheer ridiculousness of it. What had been a really cool, creepy, and unique concept, and would have made a great movie with a lot of really cool details in the setting and through recurring imagery, was ultimately ruined by the director's libido and inability to show women on screen without them having sex or being viewed sexually."

","""It Follows"" joins ""The Babadook"" in a mini-boom of horror films in the last year or two that turn the literal psychological states of their main characters into tangible bogeymen that are every bit as real (and seemingly unstoppable) as Michael Meyers or Jason Voorhees. In ""The Babadook,"" the protagonist's overwhelming grief became first a frightening predator lurking in the shadows and then a demon that possessed her and turned her into the monster. In ""It Follows,"" the predator springs from adolescent sexual awareness and promiscuity, a sort of walking, talking STD that no medical treatment is going to get rid of. In fact, it's easy to read ""It Follows"" as an anxious response to our modern-day knowledge of every consequence, from deadly to merely embarrassing, that can arise from sex, both protected and otherwise. But I think the movie is less about the fear of anything so specific as contracting an STD, and more about that purgatory between adolescence and adulthood when kids start doing and feeling adult things without the life experience to process them emotionally. It's no accident that parents are absent in this film; these kids are on their own, navigating the scary emotional waters of sexual awakening without a compass.<br/><br/>The movie isn't totally successful, and it's certainly not very scary. The threat at the center of the film is sometimes treated as a supernatural force, sometimes as something corporeal that can be outrun and killed, and the balancing act between the two is frequently awkward. But it's a thoughtful movie and, like ""The Babadook,"" it picks as its monster something far more horrifying, because so much more real, than any monster dreamed up in a slasher film.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

","It Follows is a 2014 American supernatural horror film written and directed by David Robert Mitchell, and starring Maika Monroe.<br/><br/>After carefree teenager Jay (Maika Monroe) sleeps with her new boyfriend, Hugh (Jake Weary), for the first time, she learns that she is the latest recipient of a fatal curse that is passed from victim to victim via sexual intercourse. Death, Jay learns, will creep inexorably toward her as either a friend or a stranger. Jay's friends don't believe her seemingly paranoid ravings, until they too begin to see the phantom assassins and band together to help her flee or defend herself.<br/><br/>It Follows has sparked numerous interpretations from film critics in regard to the source of ""it"" and the film's symbolism. Critics have interpreted the film as a parable on HIV/AIDS, other sexually transmitted infections, and the social perceptions thereof; the sexual revolution; and ""primal anxieties"" about intimacy."

","*Warning, review contains MAJOR spoilers*<br/><br/>With all the respect to the movie's premise, the tribute to Dostoevsky and plenty of nudity, I'm afraid that the movie is a bit short on the... action.<br/><br/>Between rather poor exposition scenes, which could be forgiven in an indie movie, the plot is presented in a pretty dubious way. ""It"" has weird rules, and performs them in a pretty inconsistent manner.<br/><br/>A gruesome murder? Why? A plain rape? Okay, that's for the camera. Hair-grabbing? What for? I thought ""it""'s sexual conscience incarnate, not some Paranormal demon. Infinite strength is used solely on knocking people away, breaking small holes and windows, but never to get to the point. Why even be susceptible physically?<br/><br/>And the method of passing it on... sheesh. It's even sillier than the Ring. You don't have to show the tape, just keep banging everyone you see. Always hated that person? Give in, have at it, and you can be sure he dies. Damn, the possibilities of abusing this power, it's a perverted Death Note!<br/><br/>And the transformations... what's up with them? ""Takes the most effective form""... Aka a totally naked person for no apparent reason. Or a ghoulish child. Or a undead urinating lady. And then the old woman, man and even the target himself. But, once again, the best thing is to clearly transform into a Frankenstein to break a small hole and enter as a ghoul. So effective. Perhaps it's afraid of doorknobs?<br/><br/>People say it's not reliant on jump scares. To be honest, it has only barely less sound shocks than Paranormal. And all of them are even less reasonable.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is better themed than Paranormal, the potential for the franchise exists. Because the cliffhanger... is real. But if it's real, then ""it"" learned how to wear bright clothes and actually increased its pace. Maybe next time it will be more effective and less expositional.<br/><br/>With all the rules established, it's pretty pointless to keep it psychological. It's physical, it's invulnerable... it's a thing to be toyed with. Just like Alien.<br/><br/>So let there be sequel. Deaths. Origins. Incredible situations. The proper milking of the franchise. It's rare, but I think the sequel in this case would be better than the original, because while the original can pave the road, but can't really ride it."
"funnygy","8","4","66","5 April 2015"," The best I've seen in a while, very well-constructed.
","As a jaded horror fan, I wasn't sure what to expect from ""It Follows."" I heard it was scary, some even saying it was the scariest ever. But it seems like every few years some new film comes out and gets the same lip service, only to prove either uninteresting, unoriginal, or just plain irritating (""Blair Witch Project,"" anyone?) So I was relieved when ""It Follows"" had me right from the beginning, and downright delighted when it followed through on the promise shown in its first few minutes. Indeed, it reminded me of George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead."" Not because there are any zombies or shopping malls, but because it's a low-budget yet well-crafted, inventive film that delivers the goods while sneaking in some social commentary. <br/><br/>For starters, let's talk about the characters. One of the most common flaws in fright flicks is that the viewer never feels much attachment to the protagonists, so there's no real sense of loss when they're in danger or even when they die. We've all sat through movies where we don't care if the characters get killed, or even worse, we wind up rooting for them to get killed. That is not the case here. The film takes what could've been very stock, clichéd characters and fleshes them out, and the young cast does an excellent job of bringing them to life. As the story went on it was as if I could see a little of myself in each of them.<br/><br/>Second, the film's premise carefully builds and then reinforces a haunting sense of dread, another vital ingredient missing from so many entries in this genre. I felt it when I read Stephen King's ""'Salem's Lot"" and the first time I saw Romero's ""Dawn."" Those works, like ""It Follows,"" give the reader/viewer a troubling uneasiness... that awful feeling (like you have in dreams) that while you can run, you can't hide. As one character puts it, ""All you can do is buy yourself some time."" In King's novel, it was knowing that every night, the town's (human) population was getting smaller and smaller, while the number of vampires was getting bigger and bigger. In Romero's film, it was the constant threat of the zombies; no matter where you go, no matter how much you barricade the door, you never know when you'll look up and see a flesh-hungry walking corpse ready to make you its lunch. And in ""It Follows""... well, I won't say anything. Just see the film and you'll know what I mean.<br/><br/>Another noteworthy aspect of this film is that it manages to seem fresh even though it's not that original. There are elements of John Carpenter's ""Halloween,"" Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" and Gore Verbinski's ""The Ring."" (I include the names of the directors not to sound pretentious, but to differentiate them from the remakes and diluted sequels that followed them. At least for the first two - I've never seen either the Japanese film ""Ringu,"" of which Verbinski's film is a remake, nor ""The Ring Two."") It's arguable (and doubtless is being argued on a web forum somewhere at this very moment) that we've seen all this before, and yet ""It Follows"" doesn't at all seem like another by-the-numbers horror movie. It's well-crafted and polished, with extraordinary attention to detail in virtually every shot. (One thing I'm still trying to figure out is when exactly is the story supposed to take place? Again, see the movie and you'll see what I mean.)<br/><br/>Finally, there's the social commentary sprinkled throughout the movie. It reminded me of Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Boogie Nights,"" in that the commentary here is both subtle and non-judgmental. This isn't a slasher flick where the vices of teenagers and young adults equal a death sentence. It's just part of who these people are. They're decent kids who have a drink or a smoke now and then; who doesn't at that age? And as for the dangers of premarital sex... again, just see the movie.<br/><br/>If you're a horror fan, ""It Follows"" is a must-see. And if you're one of those who doesn't like horror because it seems like once you've seen one, you've seen them all, you should really give this one a look as well. It may seem familiar at first, but trust me, you haven't seen this one before."
"zetes","7","3","44","30 March 2015"," The hype is ridiculous, but this is a pretty good horror film
","Wow! I've never quite heard such angry grumbling over a movie when the lights came up before. The word ""horrible"" was being thrown around generously, so much so that the teenage girl waiting to clean up the theater afterword commented on how angry everyone was. No, I'm not quite with these people (the theater was loaded at 11 AM, for the record), but this was a major disappointment. Much like the desperately overrated The Babadook, this is a somewhat clever horror movie that sort of bucks mainstream horror conventions. Just because it's better than most horror movies (and, believe me, I had to sit through half an hour of terrible-looking horror previews to see this movie - if you want a good laugh look up Unfriended on Youtube) doesn't make it anything fantastic.<br/><br/>Maika Monroe (pretty but thankfully not boringly pretty like the protagonists in most horror movies) sleeps with her new boyfriend for the first time, and is in for a rude awakening. He knocks her out and ties her to a wheelchair. When she wakes up, he explains that some mysterious, murderous entity, in the guise of a random person, will follow her until it is able to kill her. She is advised to find someone quick and pass on the curse, although, if the next person is killed, it will come after her again. Monroe, her sister and their friends attempt to run away from the thing, but escape proves impossible.<br/><br/>There is definitely some cleverness in the filmmaking. I love the way Mitchell makes you scan every frame of the film to search for the next follower. The film is never that scary, but it does raise some nice tension. There are some big flaws, though. The monster, when it appears, is usually pale with sunken, dark eyes, and it thus resembles a lot of modern horror ghosts and zombies (similar monsters appeared in three or four previews before the movie). The monster even hisses at one point. Lame. The film's biggest mistake is the climax, where the characters suddenly become total morons. My enthusiasm for the film fell a lot during the sequence. The characters in general are pretty bland, though they're perhaps a tiny bit better than your average horror film (I did quite like Monroe's performance). I loved the John Carpenter-esque score."
"SteveHistory","6","3","44","27 March 2015"," A Great Idea But Disappointing
","(THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS)<br/><br/>I am baffled at the gushing reviews given for this movie. Granted the IDEA is superb, I loved the idea behind the plot but the movie overall was a disappointment for me. The camera work, which at first was brilliant, soon lost credibility with so many shots that added NOTHING to the plot and were distracting and misleading. Generally a camera shot should contribute to the plot by offering clues, establishing location, mood, or suspense, but multiple camera shots led NOWHERE and became a distraction. After three or four camera shots led to zero payoff, the director lost credibility. Also, the plot established that those following the victims of the curse would always be walking, but then we see one of those shown earlier as walking, suddenly now shows up on a bike. Also the reason why certain people were ""followers"" is never fleshed out in the plot, with some being dressed, some naked, or partially naked, some just stood (as the man on the house) and NEVER walked at all which we were previously told was a clue as to the nefarious intent of the follower. This plot needs to tie together those that are the followers with those that are followed. In one scene a male ""follower"" enters a house but the murder is carried out by a female. I WILL admit it is an idea that stays with you after you leave the theater and I DID find myself paying attention to people walking towards my direction outside the theater, but overall I was disappointed with many aspects of this film.<br/><br/>Sorry."

If it were a car, this movie would be a brown morris minor driven at a very slow pace down your street. Everyone would stop to see it, feel compelled to watch until it has gone and then turn to their friend and ask WTF.

I can understand the attempt to create a ""timeless"" setting in which time periods clash inconsequentially in a repeatably jarring way. And I can even jive with the ""artistic"" cinematography with its long, lingering shots and odd angles for the sake of, well, art! What I can't forgive is the unmitigated sense that this entire thing was built off of an idea rather than a story. ""Hey, let's have a throwback referencing every great horror movie and director under the sun, which hearkens on the sexual exploitation of horror slashers!"" What's it about? ""Well, just some thing that follows you around after you have sex with the wrong person."" What's the plot? ""Well, they're going to run from it. Stop someplace until it comes. Run from it again. Stop someplace else. And well, kind of do that for an hour and a half."" There is no motive. There is no character development (in fact there is barely any character at all). There are no developing story arcs. And at the end, surprise, there is no resolution! Suffice to say, once again, I'm begrudgingly unimpressed by something that was slapped with a positive rating simply because it wasn't released by mainstream Hollywood. I know, it's hip to dig anything indie, but I guess that's something I haven't quite been able to follow."

"jimbo-53-186511","5","1","13","17 July 2015"," It follows is a film that is creepy and intriguing, but sadly it's also repetitive and tedious
","Jay Height (Maika Monroe) ends up being plagued by a mysterious curse following a sexual encounter. Jay finds herself being stalked by unknown entities that can only be seen by Jay or anyone who's been afflicted by the curse. These entities will try and kill Jay and the only way that she is able to stop them is by passing on the curse by sleeping with someone else.<br/><br/>This for me was a very mixed bag and there were good and bad aspects to this film which were pretty much in equal measure. I'll start off with the positive aspects....<br/><br/>The concept was original and fairly intriguing, it also was very creepy on several occasions. I was also pleasantly surprised at how the film generally avoided clichÃ©s and that the film also had very few cheap jump scares (there were one or two, but I think every horror film is allowed a couple of cheap scares). Given the premise involved, it would have been very easy to turn this film into a tacky sex romp, but the writers wisely try to focus more on the psychological effect that the curse had on Jay. The performances were also pretty good especially from Monroe in the lead role. The cinematography was good and the score was also used to good effect.<br/><br/>Now we'll move to the weaker aspects <br/><br/>Although the concept shows promise, the development of the story is quite poor. We're never really given any explanation as to where the curse came from. Despite the fact that it's a running theme throughout the entire film it's seldom discussed and the only reference we get is when the bloke that gave it to Jay said that some girl he met at the bar gave it to him - that's it. The characters themselves are rather shallow and the conversations that they share were dull and inane - this ultimately meant that I started to lose interest in the film when there were no entities pursuing Jay or any time when the focus was off Jay and the entities. Although the idea of Jay being hunted down by the entities is creepy at first it quickly becomes repetitive when you realise that they stalk her in exactly the same manner. In some ways it did make the second half of the film more tedious and less enjoyable than the first half and I think the only reason I didn't completely lose interest is because this film is relatively short.<br/><br/>There are other problems within the script such as how the entities stalk Jay; aside from on one occasion they always headed towards her in positions that made it easy for her to see them. If they wanted to kill her, why make it easy for her by allowing her to see them coming a mile off? Also why can't they just kill her during the 8 or 9 hours that she's asleep at night? It's also referenced early in the film that the entities can take on forms of people that the target knows in order to make it easier to kill them, but again this was only seen on one occasion. It would have made the film more creepy and more terrifying if we'd have seen more examples of this... It puzzled me that this excellent idea was established at the start, but never used for some reason.<br/><br/>I'm prepared to commend the film for being original and the concept is intriguing; the film is also very creepy at times and there were a couple of occasions where I did get a tingle down my spine. However, the repetitive nature of the narrative and some of the tedious dialogue and shallow characters do undo some of the stronger aspects and drag the film down making it a somewhat average affair."

And you sit back and think ""there's no way that can be the ending,"" clearly knowing it obviously is. It was awful, and no questions were answered. Hoping for a sequel."

The fact that when she is haunted, it's by an entity that just walks in a slow manner kills all the suspense and terror of the movie, I think this is why they make zombies run these days?! WWZ and I am legend comes to mind.<br/><br/>To be fair, the continuous suspenseful music is very filling and I loved the photography between scenes, as a matter a fact that's probably what I love the most in this one, the ""offscenes"".<br/><br/>This one it's clearly not your typical teen movie, and has some highlights, but it lacks the foundations in the gender, wait, I can't really say that, it has horror (although not scary) and it has mystery, but it's just... too weak *shrugs*.<br/><br/>Tl;dr: paranoia, promiscuity, sexuality, claustrophobia, egocentrism and friendship, that sums up the whole film."

","I saw ""It Follows"", starring Maika Monroe-Labor Day, The Bling Ring; Keir Gilchrist-United States of Tara_tv, The Rocker; Daniel Zovatto- Laggies, Revenge_tv and Olivia Luccardi-Orange is the New Black_tv, Girls_tv.<br/><br/>This is a horror movie that could have been a lot better if they would have explained a few things more. Parts of it reminded me of the original Halloween, Final Destination and Invasion of the Body Snatchers mashed together. Maika plays a teenager that likes a certain new boy. He takes her to a secluded area and they do what teenagers in these types of movies do, have sex, consensually of course. He then drugs her and ties her to a chair-not consensually and not what most teenagers do in these types of movies-and when she wakes up, he tells her that he has passed 'it' to her-'it' being some sort of sexual curse that can be given to another person by having sex with them. According to the curse, there is a zombie-like creature that walks-never runs-after the cursed person. It can take different forms-men, women, old, young-and it is relentless in it's walking. If it catches the person, it kills them and then it backtracks down the list of sexually active teens, to the originator. Olivia plays one of Maika's girl friends and Keir and Daniel are male friends that volunteer to take the curse from Maika by sacrificing themselves and having sex with her. There is nudity- sometimes, the walker is a nude man or woman-and during the end credits it said that it was filmed in Detroit, Michigan. It's not a bad movie, I just think it would have been better if they would have given more background information about the curse, the walker and the bodies it used. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes. I don't know if I would buy it on DVD but it would be a good rental."

Maybe I have higher standards for horror films than I should have. <br/><br/>It Follows plays out like an homage--albeit a worthy homage--to John Carpenter's films.

"ShaeSpencer","7","1","18","4 April 2015"," Not the work of genius I had hoped for.
","I was kind of underwhelmed. The cinematography is at times really cool and the music is often great. Maika Monroe's performance was a pleasant surprise as well. In the first act or so in this film, as in most or all of ""The Guest,"" I wasn't too moved by her performance, which felt overly restrained and inexpressive. But as time went on in ""It Follows,"" there's actually a startling depth and reality to her reactions to the strange stuff going on. The mood and atmosphere is very well done.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there's something of an emptiness to the movie that I don't quite know how to verbalize. The relationships feel flat and mostly uninspiring, and the core tension of the film rests on whether or not the ""villain"" is truly scary, which to me it only occasionally was. The film drags 15 minutes or so too long, and the pace doesn't ever recover the energy of some of the better sequences. The ending made a certain sense in the context of the movie, but was unsatisfying."
"kluseba","5","2","57","15 April 2015"," Interesting concept falling flat
","""It Follows"" is an independent supernatural horror movie that takes place in and around Detroit, Michigan. The nightmarish story, the electronic score and the use of wide-angel lenses are inspired by classic American and European horror movies from the sixties and seventies. Especially the works of Dario Argento, John Carpenter and George Romero come to my mind.<br/><br/>The main idea of the movie is fairly interesting. After sexual encounters, people are somehow infected since they are slowly followed by a supernatural entity that can take any appearance and which is trying to brutally kill them. Only infected people can see the danger while the supernatural entity isn't dangerous for anybody else as long as they don't try to interfere on purpose. It's impossible to kill the supernatural entity but one can chase it away by violently attacking it. Infected victims usually try to pass on the curse by having sexual encounters on their own but this doesn't seem to be an efficient solution either. The whole thing gets even more mysterious since it's not possible to pass the curse to everybody. Some people get infected during sexual encounters while others don't.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of a female college student that got infected by her new boyfriend who tries to hide his real identity and whereabouts. Along with her sister and several friends, she tries in vain to escape from the supernatural entity. She also tries to pass on the curse to several friends who want to help her. The movie features in fact three quite boring sex scenes and much more useless sexual innuendo that only distracts from the story. Since the danger is still present, the college student and her friends finally try to set a risky trap to kill the strange entity for good.<br/><br/>The movie has sparked numerous interpretations in regard to the source of the supernatural entity and the film's symbolism. Some critics believe that this movie is simply portraying a nightmare and that there is no deeper meaning behind it. Others have interpreted the film as a parable on sexually-transmitted diseases and its consequences. Some people claim that the movie deals with primal anxieties about intimacy and first sexual relationships. As you can see, there are a lot of interesting questions around this phenomenon but none of these are actually answered.<br/><br/>Sadly, the interesting concept, the great vintage atmosphere, the brilliant score and the clever use of wide camera angles aren't enough to make the entire movie enjoyable. One of the main flaws of the movie is its constantly slow pace and lack of gripping tension. I have no problem with restrained supernatural horror movies but most of them get more and more menacing and end in a really intensive way. This isn't the case at all with this film. One constantly expects the movie to get a little boost as time goes by but it ultimately falls flat. Another problem is the generic acting and the exchangeable characters. I'm aware of the fact that this movie tries to portray a bunch of ordinary teenagers that get shaken up by things they can't fight or understand but the actors and especially actresses are so dull that one simply doesn't care about their fates at all. <br/><br/>In the end, this overrated movie wastes a really mysterious plot idea and great inspirations from classic genre films for a lackluster flick without any true highlights. Since this amorphous film doesn't have a real ending, there are rumours about a sequel with another interesting story. In this potential project, some infected teenagers try to trace the supernatural entity back to find out where it came from and how the curse started. That's why I'm not yet giving up on this project but as it is now, I would recommend you to skip this over-hyped revival flick and wait for a more interesting second instalment."

","In the intro, a girl runs out of her house at sunrise in her sleepwear and high heels for some reason. She stands in the middle of the road then runs back into the house and back out. She gets into her car and drives to a beach. Later we see her dead and her body wrecked.<br/><br/>Next we meet a girl named ""Jay"" for some reason, her sister, a friend and a guy friend. They hang out, watch old movies on a black and white tube TV. One night she goes out on a date with a guy she's been seeing. They have sex for first time with each other. Afterward, he drugs her, binds her to a wheelchair and takes her to an abandoned building. Now he comes clean. From now on she will be followed by a stranger or somebody she knows. The followers tend to walk slowly so she can outrun them. A way to deal with this situation is to have sex with someone, it will pass on the condition to them. That's why he had sex with her. And he's right, a naked woman goes after them.<br/><br/>And sure enough, next day at school Jay sees an old woman following her. Problem is, no one else sees the followers. Her friends don't understand what's going on with her. She starts seeing followers everywhere. Now another kid from the neighborhood joins the gang, which apparently has nothing else going in their lives than looking after Jay. They drive to the new guy's family remote beach house. But even there someone appears. When one of her friends throws a chair at it, it fights back and sends the kid flying. But they realize that shooting it in the head seems to work.<br/><br/>Jay ends up in the hospital and decides to have sex with the new guy much to the chagrin of her virginal friend who has a crush on her. But oddly enough the guy sees nothing. One night though, Jay sees him breaking into his own house and his mom has turned into a follower. The kids then devise a plan to trap a follower and eliminate the threat.<br/><br/>It Follows is a different horror movie. It's very much influenced by 70s/early 80s horror movies in terms of the music especially. It reminded me of another very original movie--The Guest. And like it, It Follows also is a bit anachronistic. It seems to be set in the 70s and sometimes it doesn't. Perhaps that accounts also for the very slow pace, which is a problem here because in the addition to that, not much really happens. And the lives of the kids isn't particularly interesting and neither is the lead character Jay. It turns out that the followers are most interesting; not that we get to learn anything about them. In fact we learn nothing about this situation. Nor do we learn how come the date happens to know so much about it. Sure there's the interpretation that all this represents a sexually transmitted disease, or AIDS I guess, since we're talking about a Hollywood production. But that doesn't explain anything. So we're left to make whatever we want to make of It Follows. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't give us enough to go on, nor is it striking enough to care about but it does have a different style."
"Robert_duder","6","1","21","4 July 2015"," Umm okay
","Halloween, Friday The 13th, Blair Witch Project...these were indie horror films that set records, created franchises and legends. Minimal budgets with up and coming actors and downright creepy scenes that were legendary. Nowadays, indie horror usually means really awful and It Follows is NOT awful. It doesn't feel low budget and that's a great compliment. Its well shot and has some genuinely good special effects and creepy scenes but it completely lacks the scare factor. There is nothing that really truly got under my skin and freaked me out. The characters are mostly empty although acted well and perhaps the biggest problem is that it feels like it goes on far too long. The pacing is not great. I might be a little harsh on it but I heard a lot of great things about this and a lot of comparisons to the equally hyped Babadook which was also ""just okay"" It Follows definitely shows a lot of promise and shows a lot of talent in the film making department but as a horror film it just needs a lot of fine tuning. Its a good effort at demonstrating what they're capable of as a film maker but does that make it a good movie? <br/><br/>The cast is okay. Everyone plays their role well enough but no one stands out as the hero. I mean, its clear who our scream queen is supposed to be but Maika Monroe just doesn't have the chops to carry the movie or make us care enough. Her friends all play their roles well enough but this isn't a cast you relate to or even can invest yourself in. Keir Gilchrist, Lili Sepe (who I actually thought showed more charisma than Monroe did), Daniel Zovatto and Jake Weary play decent roles but the script isn't good enough to really let them showcase what they could do.<br/><br/>The film has some creepy scenes and some very nice cinematography but when you go into a film, especially a horror movie, you're not expecting to watch a wanna-be filmmaker trying to prove that he could make a good movie...you just want a good movie. The very inexperienced David Robert Mitchell writes and directs (I always warn about this) and I can say without a doubt that as a director he has a distinctive style and vision. However, he goes out of his way to make sure you see it instead of creating a clever movie and making it his own. The long laborious shots of the run down areas of Detroit are not necessary for this story. The plot itself is very bizarre and the ending is so abrupt that it actually makes you even more angry that you're getting so little out of it in the end. It Follows is okay but really not that much better than your run of the mill straight to DVD horror flick. It was unimpressive and forgettable. 6/10"

","To start off, I had huge expectations of the movie. Looking at the IMDb ratings and being a horror fan I was expecting this movie to be really good. <br/><br/>In the movie the central character is being followed by a spirit, some jinxed ghost character, etc you can call it ""It"" after her boyfriend passes it to her after sex. He tells her if the ""It"" reaches you it will kill her and then kill him. The only way she can avoid this is by passing it on to someone else, obviously by having sex with someone else. I felt the background score really deserves an applause. I can't really rate this movie really high as it creates tension in some scenes but not till end of the movie. Would prefer watching movies like Sinister again any day over this."

""How long doest the act must take"" ""What if i use the wrong hole?"" ""What if i'm bi?"" and so on (never answered unfortunately). Those qustions will distract you long enough for an UNEXPECTED FULL FRONTAL ON DA ROOF to make an appearance.

","The following analytical review is just a personal statement of a horror-movies fan. I do not mean to insult or underestimate any of the film cast or workers by any word.<br/><br/>When compared to other hot horror movies in 2014-2015 such as Annabelle, The Lazarus Effect, and Insidious 3, I believe that this movie falls behind. We've seen many great cold horror movies in the past (e.x. Orphan, Let the Right One In), but this one is far away from joining them. The simplicity of the story-idea has forbidden the storyline from expanding and involving more creativity. Directors often tend to use the surprise element to make the audience jump from their seats and leave the movies theater very happy (and scared eventually), but Mitchell here wanted to evolve a more complicated cinematic experience in his work which is to be counted, but not praised.<br/><br/>I would not watch a ""It Follows 2"" if they decided to do so, but it would be interesting to have another director and script creator to work on this lovely idea.

","Absolutely loved this film, I was captivated from the beginning to end. I don't even know where to start.<br/><br/>This film doesn't treat you like an idiot. It actually uses inference to let the audience figure things out for themselves and not spell it out for you like a lot of horror films do. Theres no characters going ""oh! so this means that and oh remember that scene audience???"". Thank god.<br/><br/>Cinematography also is usually lacklustre in horror films which I find frustrating as the genre gives so much opportunity to do some wacky and inventive things. And since this is horror; you're trying to scare the audience, you can do a lot of things with that space given. This film delivers that, the shots are amazing and adds another dimension to the experience. One example is that use of slow, creeping zoom shots add it's overall vibe, it also is a reference to the film's monster. The long take at the beginning of the film is also perfect.<br/><br/>In a lot of horror films, I find a lot of unrealistic and questionable settings, character decisions and rules that are set in the universe that are inevitably broken, all of these things take me out of the experience. While I can't say this film dodges all of that, it still does a killer job. I'm usually a stickler for endings and resolutions too, almost never feeling completely satisfied in these kind of plots but with this film I thought it was great.<br/><br/>I do think there are a lot of questions to be asked about how the monster works but I still think that they revealed and left out enough information to make it work really well.<br/><br/>The acting was really good in this film, the characters felt really grounded and realistic which I loved. They also actually had personality, were funny and weren't 1 dimensional. EXCEPT for Greg (the skeptic who died), I do think he was kind of poorly written and it was too convenient to the plot.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also amazing, synths were masterfully utilised, and using it in suspenseful parts making them sound unsettling and uncanny was so smart. Reminds me of those niche little 8 bit games you can find in the indie gaming world.<br/><br/>God I could go on and on but these are the things that struck me the most about the film. I need to watch it again."

Casualties are inevitable and necessary to flatten the curve and rid our communities of the vile hidden evil. It Follows is haunting and the actors sell out to make you look over your own shoulder at every turn. It's a shocking and original take on the age old conundrum - be silent and await thy fate, or run like hell. The fun is in the chase, not the result. This film is exquisite because it takes itself seriously and not afraid of awakening demons from within your bones. Primeval in shocking the audience with manifestations of death, you cannot help but feel like IT is truly behind you and will not stop until you succumb to its passions."

","IT FOLLOWS is one of the all-too rare, atmospheric horror films of the 21st century. The bleak sense of impending terror and doom starts in the opening seconds, continuing until the end. Made in a retro-style that perfectly mimics the movies of the 1970's, it brings back memories of early John Carpenter, Wes Craven, or Don Coscarelli. It also recreates the same sort of looming, ominous dread that permeated movies like MESSIAH OF EVIL. The story is simple and unique, which, in itself is refreshing. The idea of the title is clear and perfectly executed. The main teens (Maika Monroe, Lili Sepe, Keir Gilchrist, and Olivia Luccardi) are NOT oblivious idiots, and are actually convincing in their roles. The use of actual, urban settings / neighborhoods adds realism and grit, missing in more highly polished films. In short, everything works.

The trailer itself (in my opinion) honestly wasn't all that captivating, but after reading up on it, who some of the cast was, as well as - again - all the good things I've heard from friends, those on Dreadit, and elsewhere, I figured I needed to stop being my ol' judgemental self and give it a shot.<br/><br/>I didn't regret that.<br/><br/>The opening scene with Annie doesn't last too long, but it seals the deal with starting this movie off the most puzzling, yet alluring way possible. She's clearly distressed, sprinting (in heels!) around in what seems to be a ""for life or death"" fashion, telling everyone she's ok. It's not explained (at this point, at least) what was wrong with poor Annie as she jumps into a car and bolts off to the middle of nowhere, but I've bitten the bait and am hooked to see what happens next. Annie makes a call and appears to have hit the machine. Seconds later we see her distorted, deceased, with just as much of an explanation as we had from the get-go.<br/><br/>The way ""It Follows"" has began absolutely sets the pace for the rest of the film. In the brief few minutes the movie has began to play it's established to us that our antagonist isn't understood and cannot be stopped, which alone is horrifying. The music (provided by Disasterpeace) so far has beautifully, yet sadistically added tension to Annie's plight and would go on to do the same for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>What I liked most about this film was the emphasis the setting brought along with how crap of a situation this was. There's no bright skies when you're depressed, sleep-deprived, paranoid, tormented, and being made to feel as though you're insane, just as Jay is throughout the film. The only scene that shows sunshine also winds up being the scene wherein her friends and sister finds out she's far from crazy.<br/><br/>Let's talk about that beach scene, shall we? So well done. The minute I noticed ""it"" simply walking towards Jay from behind, I was alert and anxious as person could possibly be. Is Jay going to go swim and unknowingly avoid it? Does everyone else see them and just isn't saying anything? What is going to happen?! Jay's grabbed, and as crappy as that is, fortunately for her everyone else (except Greg) can see her hair denying the laws of physics. This wouldn't be the only time Yara, Kelly, and Paul see Jay get attacked.<br/><br/>The pool. Arguably the best scene in the movie. Let's be frank, alright? Most teenagers - hell, most people in general - make ridiculously, mind numbingly stupid decisions in horror movies. In this scene Jay's friends put to action what they've learned from the beach. ""It"" may be unseen to them, but it is very much a physical entity, as they throw a blanket on to it after being guided by a distressed Jay. Once covered, they attack it, biding Jay time to escape. This scene was as smart as it was riddled with anxiety. Would this scene be the end of Jay? We've seen ""it"" capture others, so could this be her time? I'm not sure if I was rooting for her to survive or if I was just tense due to picturing myself in a situation like that. Either way, the scene was very well done.<br/><br/>The acting was fantastic. It took me a good minute to see Paul as Paul and not Marshall from United States of Tara (amazing show, btw), but despite that I have no complaints about acting. Even when it comes to pacing/progression, the film doesn't move faster than it should, and doesn't have anything that might be seen as ""filler"". When you look at the actual cinematography of it, the film is just superb to look at, yet unnerving all the same, but in a good way.... I mean... if there is a ""good way"" to be unnerving.<br/><br/>If you haven't had a chance to see ""It Follows"", I recommend it. Seeing all the disappointing duds the genre has been putting out the past decade, this film is a breath of fresh air that brings a much needed taste of something new. I know I'm definitely going to be second guessing people walking in my direction for the next couple of weeks because of it.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

","Not too bad. Worth a watch if you like this kind of horror movie."
"Emily_Baines","7","0","1","12 August 2019"," A different horror movie
","It is a fresh movie of this genre. It is a frightening movie with an idea and it is worth of applauses. Perhaps there are not a lot of tricks that will make you jump out of chair, however, the tense is being built up constantly during the playback.
As I have mentioned, I was really surprised that I was able not only to catch some kind of deeper meaning, but it has also been not accidental; it is an iceberg-type of film. In my opinion, it is a story about experiencing some kind of traumatising event that leaves such a deep wound in one that he may start seeing treath even in the people he loves. And trying to pass one's inner dread never grants a relief; if the passed fear 'kills' one's 'victim', the grief can come back to the 'sender' (it is extremely visible in the situation between Jay and Greg). In the end of the movie, Yara says a very nice quote about fearing physical damage (like death) instead of fighting with the causes of it. Probably that would have saved the characters of this story...
There were some aspects I did not like at all in this movie, that's for sure. The aesthetical appearance and psychological decency of this film was a bit wrecked by the cheap tricks that did not even nicely submerged into the story. For example, although gross 'Its' should have looked scary it was quite dull and made an adverse effect.
Last but not least, I want to thank for an amazing soundtrack. The music is tenseful and original enough that I would like to hear it again and not only as a part of this movie. Believe me, you will like it. In addition, the cinematography is also elegant and captivating.
Consequently, those who are seeking for a classical horror movie to eat some popcorn with friends in a late evening in the autumn might be let down. Anyway, this film will certainly be appreciated by those who want the good time and some thoughtful material both."

","For me, the best variety of horror mechanisms are the contemporary types that deal with suspense and dread. Mundane jump scares rarely work, with minimal to no involvement in terrorising the audience. But, a mysteriously unknown shape-shifting creature lurking towards the camera at a consistently slow pace? Brutally terrifying. Yet it's the allegorical nature of Mitchell's sophomore efforts that truly captivates. After having intercourse with her date, a young girl is stalked by a transmogrifying entity with only the knowledge that she must ""pass on"" this lurker by sleeping with another person.<br/><br/>Metaphorically exploring the rampart behaviour of teenagers who excessively sleep around, the initial ambiguity in Mitchell's concept may put many viewers off. Rest assured, that the deathly ""tag"" premise has an important symbolic power behind it that can be interpreted in multiple different ways, typical from a contemporary horror feature. Personally, withdrawing Disasterpeace's euphoric 80s synth score that harks back to domestic horrors of its time, it's a teenager's nightmare on the passing and experiencing of sexually transmitted diseases. The pedestrian pace of the looming entity relates to the gradual health issues caused by STDs, and Mitchell consistently reminds the audience, through heavy exposition mind you, that it can be temporarily disengaged when ""passed on"". Not necessarily permanently removed though.<br/><br/>A haunting yet profoundly imaginative method in societal exploration, whilst still fuelling my nightmares with expertly executed background manipulation. There is nothing more terrifying in film than the camera focusing on something in the background that should not belong. It sends my mind into overdrive! Mitchell's delicate directorial methods, accompanied with Gioulakis' cinematography, showcases a myriad a visual talent. The numerous 360 degree rotations, intricate zooms and handheld over-the-shoulder perspectives were intensely choreographed to enhance the well-driven suspense continuously.<br/><br/>Praise must also be given to Monroe who held the film together with her ornate sense of fragility and innocence, teasing with the idea that one can free themselves when not considering the dangers of sex. When she was scared, I certainly felt the same.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, the expositional dialogue that existed for the character of Jeff felt unnatural in paving the rules of ""It"". Natural exploration would've delivered grander results, however I'm aware that runtime can be an issue even when offering various open-ended interpretations. The whole swimming pool sequence did nothing for me either and dissipated the beautifully wound suspense that preceded it. Mostly because of how artificial the setup was and the ridiculous amount of plug sockets found adjacent to a swimming pool (health and safety must've had a field day!).<br/><br/>Still, It Follows has strangely followed my mind ever since I watched it upon release. It allowed me to dive into a nightmarish vision, interpreting the symbolism for myself whilst perching on the edge of my seat. Minimalist horror at its finest. Just, no more nudity for a while..."

","Every once in a while, a horror movie comes along that just hits the exact right spot in terms of tone, style and story. It Follows is one of those films and everything about it seemed to work so well. The cast is superb and complimented by the writing and direction which give the film such a unique flavour that's quite hard to describe. It's also genuinely terrifying in its concept and there are some masterfully executed and tense sequences that really put you in the main character's shoes. All in all, this is a must watch for anyone even vaguely interested in getting scared."

"TuesdayThe17th","10","0","1","22 June 2019"," A very significant horror film during a time of duds
","To say someone is one of your favorite directors they really need to have like 2 to 3 movies. After the very recent release of ""Under the Silver Lake"" I can now say that David Robert Mitchell is definitely one of my favorite directors and definitely one of the finest directors working today. ""It Follows"" came out in 2014 and I remember going to see it in the movie theaters. I got there a little bit late so I actually missed the first 10 mins so i did initially miss the famous opening kill scene. However I watched it twice since then including last night and i realize now how much praise this film really deserves. It is masterful and refreshing. Its a rated R teen horror movie that will sit well with any crowd. Its a very unique film and is so creative that I almost had trouble truly wrapping my mind around it all even though its quite simple. Though at times intense and always creepy, I wish Mitchell showed a little more horror. A little more of the entity. Even though this movie is aimed at a younger crowd and the horror seems to only scratch the visual surface, it is still somehow quite quenching to the horror afficiando no matter how deep, scary, or gory they like their movies. The budget was around a million dollars and you can see tye budget dispersed very evenly through out. Smart directing, good execution, beautiful color schemes, a loud and dread inducing score, and young angsty teens having lots of sex. One of the best horror films of the past 10 years"

"bettyconway","8","0","1","4 April 2019"," Refreshingly Spooky Horror Movie
","When was the last time you saw a horror film that didn't need to rely on gore, big name stars, explosions, etc. to keep its audience entertained? It Follows goes by an old school approach of less is more. Half the time, we're not even sure if there's anything threatening in the frame, but we sure feel like there is.<br/><br/>It Follows tells the story of Jay, a typical American teen, who falls for a boy, they have sex, he knocks her out, and she wakes up in an abandoned building where the boy tells her that he's passed a disease on to her. Oh, but this is no ordinary STD - this one carries a death sentence unless she passes it on before it gets her. Pretty soon, she begins to be followed by many different types of people who are the death curse in disguise.<br/><br/>A killer STD is a sort of silly idea for a horror film, but It Follows takes it very seriously and it gets by due to a heavy atmosphere of dread and tension. The score by Disasterpiece helps a lot in conjuring a creepy mood as does the excellent cinematography that calls to mind early John Carpenter.<br/><br/>It Follows is practically perfect for the first half of the film, but it does have a few pacing issues by the middle of the film where the ages old ""exposition"" aspect starts going. The characters are also not the most well drawn or nuanced, which hurts a bit of the well crafted tension the film has worked so hard to create. Still, the film manages to work in spite of this.<br/><br/>It Follows is an indie film that deserves your attention."
"hunterm-34619","8","0","1","3 April 2019"," Horror done cleverly
","Tension is the name of the game in It Follows and it is built up brilliantly with the use of clever camera work, a great musical score and the use intelligent scares rather than the standard jump scare. The simple sight of a normal looking person walking towards you isn't something that strikes fear, but it does when you watch It Follows. There's a tension just from knowing that the 'monster' is always coming that carries into every scene and prevents you from relaxing even after the credits roll. There are a few unanswered questions but in a film like this that isn't always a bad thing."

","So, this was on Film4 the other day so I decided to give it a watch and as you can tell by the title. It's not bad, but it also isn't great. And here's why:<br/><br/>So, quick rundown, a young woman develops a curse after sleeping with her date and in order to get rid of it she has to sleep with someone else. If the ""demon"" kills that person it then goes back to whoever is previous again.<br/><br/>I will start with what personally annoyed me. We have this curse that the young woman got quite early on in the film. However, I would have liked some sort of explanation as to why this curse exists. Also, Jay (young woman) could have simply slept with some random lad in a bar and so on, but she fannies about for a while, because finally sleeping with another lad. At the end she ends up sleeping with one of her best friends who then hires a prostitute (which is what i suggested about 15 minutes into the film). But, clearly the prostitute dies, because the ""demon"" is following them again. That ending seems a little pointless, because I have watched 100 minutes of a film to find out, they are still cursed....<br/><br/>There are definitely positives to take from this film, the acting I thought, especially for a low budget horror, was pretty decent. The cinematography was also very good, some nice shots were used throughout and the music was different, but I believe worked well with the overall tone of this horror.<br/><br/>So, why do people watch horror films? To get scared. Watching this, there was definitely an element of constant horror as you never know whether this ""demon"" will appear as it would follow the character at random times. There was also some jump scares thrown into the mix so yeah I would say this definitely has that horror element. The idea of being constantly followed and watched is a current zeitgeist that bothers a lot of people and they have incorporated that well.<br/><br/>I have given this a 5/10, because overall I believe it's simply just an average film. You won't be disappointed by it, nor will you be impressed."

"wadegustafson","4","0","2","3 January 2019"," It Follows...Slowly, Wonkily, Nonsensically.
","First the good. There's a decent premise/concept: A disturbing human form phantasm/chimera passes from human host A to murderously (if incredibly slowly) stalk human host B after sex between A and B. The only way to arrest the menace is for B to pass it on to C - also through the act of intercourse. If C is killed by 'it', the pesky illusory menace returns to make life a headache for person B - so B has to find a D or die horribly. Or something like that. Also good - It's actually well shot, and lovingly captures suburban Detroit with some fine detail. Also good is its obvious homage to John Carpenter's Halloween, along with a fine, off-kilter score. Also pretty good - a decent and willing cast that handle the angst of teenage hood shifting to the dread of adulthood.<br/><br/>So that's the good out of the way.<br/><br/>Then there's the not so good. It's not really a horror in the traditional way - which is nothing to be ashamed of - but it's neither particularly scary or in anyway satisfying if it's trying to be a psychological horror, promising and intriguing prologue aside.<br/><br/>Given the premise of the film (and the early buzz raving about it), I was expecting something at least on a par with the original Ring - a film that is properly freaky. But It Follows settles for neither intensely freaky/disturbing or all out nightmarish scares.<br/><br/>You just sit there waiting for the scares to arrive and the 'It' needle barely registers close to mildly creepy. As the camera moves, you find your eyes wandering into the background to see if you can spot anything that will give you sleepless nights for a week only to find there is n-o-t-h-i-n-g there. There's no Mulholland Drive freak you out Bonnie Aarons behind the dumpster, no Don't Look Now Adelina Poerio in a red raincoat. If you're going trope hunting - this ain't that film. No psycho in a William Shatner mask either. Sorry.<br/><br/>Probably the most disturbing thing about It Follows is it's resolute refusal to make any real sense as it assiduously and deliberately avoids to cow-tow to the requirements to make a film genuinely memorable or scary. Explanations are treated with disdain, logic is given short shrift, there's absolutely no attempt at a real time revelation, and an utterly and woefully ambiguous ending that comes across as nothing more than one of those dreadful decisions by a director to 'make it more fun' and missing by planetary distance.<br/><br/>The only reason why I think a lot of critics liked this film so much is on account of exactly what the director didn't do and given him a of huge amount of latitude in producing a film that could be interpreted as something that it patently is not. In film critic's universe - this is called original or imaginative or fresh. But in avoiding entirely the A-Z of 'How To Scare The Living Hell Out Of Me' - the film pretty much throws out the entire language required do precisely that."

","Before i watched the film i saw, teh trailer, which hyped it up for me, being reminiscent of films i'd seen recently such as insidious, But sadly i don't thin kthis film did it. my first problem with the film was the spirits, for a supernatural psychological film of this nature, using human like spirits, just doesn't really work, the first scene of a spirit, was an old women in a white nightie or whatever walking into the scene, i understand the premise that i looks like someone you may know, but that scene, didn't evoke any emotions in me, and the whole premise of a curse passed on by sex, is too common in horror films now days, so to make an entire film based around that premise i can't see much room for originality, as an avid horror film, fan this film was too predictable, and it left nothing to the imagination, and the scenes at the pool made no sense, the setting up of furniture, made no sense, and the fight scene, it was more resemblant of a scene of domestic violence, than that of a fight between a human and a non human form, i liked the deliberate exclusion pf jumpscares, in preference of building tension, but that never happened, as well as this the emotion didn't seem as genuine, the scenes of drama could have been over exaggerated, it would make sense that a few stupid decisions be made, but no, and so the film seemingly just went on and on, not really changing in complexity or story, i personally like films that make you think, this was too predictable and in the end i stopped watching the film ten minutes before the end of the film due to boredom."

","After a promising opening the rest of the film takes a trip down boredom lane, even though the title suggests something sinister. For a horror/thriller (or any genre for that matter) the film has a very lazy feel about it. According to the decor, wallpaper and TV's I assume the film is set in the 80s, but the girl in the opening scene has a cell phone. Nothing about this film makes sense, not the plot nor the character's behavior. Why did Hugh tie Jay to a wheelchair after giving 'it' to her? Why did he drug her in the first place, since by that time he'd already given it to her? This entire scene was just plain dumb. From there the film just gets more vague and silly. What is 'it' and why is it following people (at a snail's pace, I might add). What is the purpose of all this? To make the plot more laughable, 'it' is passed on by having sex. What?? A sexually transmitted demon??? Sounds like a Sunday school story!!<br/><br/>The hospital sex scene is unenthusiastic and totally inappropriate. When Jay finally tracks down Hugh, he couldn't be more vague about what's going on, and NO-ONE even bothers to ask what 'it' is and what it wants?????! This 'it' demon is also the most passive demon I've ever seen in a movie, not to mention slow and utterly stupid. There isn't a single scare in the movie. I couldn't wait for it to end. Firstly, because I really wanted it to end. Secondly, because I wanted to know how it would end, I suppose. The film then ends on just as lazy a note as it's been for the past 90 minutes, no climax whatsoever. Critics praised the film. Uhm....why?? Am I missing something here?"

","I thought this would be a good horror movie because it had a lot of great reviews saying that true horror fans would love it. I consider myself to be a pretty big horror fan but I didn't not love this movie. The whole premise is creative and original but they didn't really pull it off. It wasn't a terrible movie but in terms of being a horror movie, it is definitely not good. <br/><br/>Spoilers coming...<br/><br/>First of all, it wasn't even scary. Pretty sure that's the point of a horror movie. Maybe they weren't going for surprises that get people to jump out of their seats, but a good horror movie will have people dying of anticipation for several minutes straight, at least somewhere near the end. This movie was not scary in the slightest except for some of the acting (Maika Monroe was good though). <br/><br/>The idea of a sexually transmitted curse or whatever is very interesting and original but some things about ""it"" are just stupid. I don't mind the walking. Some of the greatest horror movie villains walk (Michael Myers). But if you can drive away to buy some time, couldn't you fly to Hawaii and never have to worry about it again? Also it apparently can take the form of someone you love but they failed to capitalize on that by having it do that early when the main character doesn't believe in what's happening yet and potentially having a close call with death. The only times it does this are basically pointless to the story. <br/><br/>I don't understand why they tried to kill it at the pool. Didn't she shoot it in the neck or head at the lake? And it just got right back up. <br/><br/>Overall, not an awful movie, but it was an awful horror movie. I'll give it three stars just for the creativity."

"aaronlbacks","4","0","2","22 March 2018"," I don't really think this is a modern masterpiece, it really isn't sorry :(
","Yeah Idk, if this is one of the best of the past few years, the horror genre is most definitely in the toilet right now. Not that there's never any quality films being released, but the feces always seems to float to the top for some reason. Must be the average horror director's diet I guess; a combination of bad teenage actors, a poorly written script, a super weird concept, and just a sense of wasted time has never sat well in my stomach. Not that this film was garbage by any means, because it really isn't, but it just hit too many beats and missed too many marks for it to be a good movie. I'll start with the strongest characteristic of the film which was most definitely the camerawork. The way it spins around the environment at a fixed point is incredibly eerie and pretty smart too. Generally, there's at least a few extras in the setting who happen to be walking towards the camera (which is the main shtick here - Maika Monroe has been ""infected"" with this weird occurrence where an entity disguised as a random person follows her slowly until it finally catches up and kills her after she had sex with a man already ""infected.""), and I was always franticly searching for the one with blacked out eyes. The constant extended zooms and pans were very unnerving and gave an air of admonishment. This alone puts it above a bunch of horror movies in that it has a creative concept in how it's filmed, and it uses this concept professionally in order to obtain what it wants. I also want to praise the fact that this film did get my heart beating a few times without using a jumpscare (even though a few were used throughout, they really could have been removed). And lastly, while the concept was weird, it was pretty original and I think if it were executed better it would have been an intriguing movie. And that's about it for praise. So maybe the biggest downfall was that it was so boooooring. The blood-pumping scenes are so few and far between and the space in between is filled with blasé dialogue about ""Hey whadda we do guys?"" ""Idk man! I'm scared!"" ""AAAAAAAAAAA."" Or actually, scratch that, the biggest downfall was that this movie gave the sense that it thought it was way more important and way better than it actually was, similar to It Comes At Night from last year as well. This is just any other schlocky horror film except that it looks nice. Really! If you closed your eyes, would the dialogue and ambience be enough to carry it? I can at least appreciate a movie like Happy Death Day, also from last year, for having fun with the material even though the material is a cheap knock-off of Groundhog Day. At least it doesn't have a pretentious miasma masking it attempting to make me feel like I'm watching some horror masterpiece. If it's a masterpiece, it just will be - no need to try and convince me it is. A masterpiece certainly wouldn't have CGI that just looked this awful for some reason? A masterpiece wouldn't make the antagonist so GOOFy lookin the way it walks. A masterpiece would have a more climatic ending that didn't rehash an attempted solution that had already failed like three times already in the movie! Go watch The VVitch if you want a good modern horror film that takes itself seriously. Or rather, go watch Happy Death Day for a fun, shlock-embraced mess."
"A_Kind_Of_CineMagic","4","0","2","19 March 2018"," It Disappoints
","After hearing reviews raving about this as an exciting new horror which was properly scary I watched with anticipation of a change from all the many, many modern horrors with their lame ideas, lack of invention and lack of proper scares. Sadly all I found was that this is basically exactly like all the other weak modern efforts at horror. I cannot understand what reviewers had seen in it. <br/><br/>Right from the start the film shows itself to be the typical cliched silly teen horror and as it goes along it just gets sillier. There is a grain of a good idea in it somewhere but it just goes through the well treaded path of being a poor imitation of horrors from the 70s and early 80s. There is nothing clever or inspired in this film at all. It is reasonably well made technically but really is laughable as a horror. My wife and I both just laughed out loud all the way through it because it was so silly and shook our heads at how it did all the usual cliched things . It was not remotely scary even once.<br/><br/>In addition to various story faults it also had no sense of the period it was set in. Many things suggested it was set in the 70s or early 80s while other things betrayed that it was modern day. I could not tell what era it was intending to be portraying.<br/><br/>The totally implausible turns of events and unbelievable choices made by characters in order to allow the rather childish plot to carry on down its predictable path was extremely disappointing. The best I can say about it was that it was not really badly acted like a lot of modern horrors, it was not really badly filmed as so many films are and it was kind of brainless fun. As an entertainment to pass the time with acceptable technical film-making I suppose it may be worthy of a teen sleepover watch with your friends for a laugh but nothing more sadly.<br/><br/>Not the worst by any means as there are even more stupid horrors which are really poorly made and/or have inappropriate levels of torture porn or soft porn elements which I find really unpalatable but It Follows is only worth 3.5/10 for me."
"shannen-l-c","3","0","2","16 March 2018"," Don't understand the hype
","After seeing all the positive reviews and high ratings for 'It Follows' I started to doubt my perception or if indeed I'd watched the same film everybody else did. However, I've decided to stick with my original opinions and thoughts about this movie and thought it'd be interesting to share them since they differ from the general opinion presented in most reviews. <br/><br/>I watched 'It Follows' shortly after it was added to Netflix UK and had no expectations, since Netflix's horror section is saturated with B-rated movies that are hardly worth watching. Whilst I understand the idea of a sexually transmitted entity is somewhat original and has never been done before (from my recollection), it's also ridiculous. It was presented as being a terrifying and serious thing, but I couldn't take it seriously and that immediately destroys any sense of fear or anxiety, which is important to feel when watching a horror film. <br/><br/>Putting aside the idea of the entity itself, the plot was practically non-existent. The main female character contracts the entity at the beginning of the film and the rest of it is her feeling sorry for herself (she should try taking responsibility for her own actions - she's the one that had unprotected sex with a stranger) and expecting everyone else around her to fix her problems. What REALLY ticked me off and was the point where I completely wrote the film off is when she selfishly sleeps with her ""best friend"" a.k.a the sweet guy that lives across the street that's been crushing on her since they were kids, transmitting the entity to him and resulting in his death. Here's a question, WHO DOES THAT? How the hell is an audience supposed to root for a person that would do that? <br/><br/>I can't understand what's so appealing about this film. Granted, I'm writing this review after having seen it some months ago, but I clearly remember the end credits rolling and thinking, ""Is that it?"" Having seen a lot of horror films, I'll be the first to hold my hands up and admit it takes A LOT to scare me, but this didn't have me on the edge of my seat even once. It's pretty hard to be afraid of some mysterious invisible entity that seems to move at a snails pace and that is so easily out-manoeuvred (the main girl seems to live with it successfully for long enough, as do the many people before her that manage to pass it on). Perhaps there may be some finer details such as the music or direction that was better, but none of it that was significant enough for me to remember it positively. <br/><br/>My advice would be, if you decide to watch this movie DON'T go in with high expectations based on the reviews, because it's really not as good as that. For some odd reason people seem to have jumped on the bandwagon with this one and everyone sings its praises, when in reality it's no different than any other mediocre B-rated movie with poor acting, no story and zero creativity or intrigue."

Acting and cinematography are OK, but the scary thing behaves in a horrorly correct way only when the ""monster"" transforms in Greg's mother and kills it.<br/><br/>Otherwise the behavior of the 'creature' is not understandable. Why does it go on materializing itself so far from the victim, namely Jay, if it is so slow?<br/><br/>I mean, I don't usually love paranormal horror movies, but once I have accepted the supernatural premise everything must be coherent, like in Carrie (1976).<br/><br/>Anyway, all in all, it is quite amusing and I don't regret to have seen it"

A ""sexually transmitted"" demon. How often do you hear that?And I think that is why the movie got such high marks.

","8/10 Horror Movie (Gone WRONG) (Gone SEXUAL). While these clickbaity titles can be applied to almost every horror movie, good or bad. ""It Follows"" not only manages to subvert these tropes, not with excluding them, but giving them the main focus. Has a parody of anything being more serious and competent that the material that is being parodied? Not until this production happened. It tells the story of a teenage girl that is hunted by a mysterious slow-walking entity after a sexual encounter. The rules that this ""entity"" follows are intentionally ridiculous, with the goal to make fun of other horror clichés.But is the film funny? Not even a little bit, actually quite the opposite. The sex scenes that usually would make the teens who sneaked into the theatre gasp hormonally, are disturbing and violent. 80s vibe follows throughout with the splendid use of old techno music, despite the day and age being unknown. The cast does a stellar job conveying the horror of the STD curse, with Maika Monroe looking too much like a blonde Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Keil Gilchrist plays the awkward friend crushing on the Prom Queen with a pleasant twist, involving a great character arc. The other kids are disposable horror movies characters, without being annoying.My main gripe is how illogical these characters act in certain situations and it even seems like the director acknowledges it.The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous for the pocket-sized budget. The pacing was perfect and I felt involved almost the whole time. Twisting the idea of biological reproducing is a really haunting idea, as well as the multiple themes of growing-up. The climax has brought a lot of controversy, but oh well, I loved it.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Overall It Follows has a lot of great concepts and themes going on and the majority of them is executed successfully and few of them poorly. If you expect standard Hollywood-is jump scares you will probably be disappointed, but if you seek a unique horror movie with a compelling message you should definitely check it out."

Maybe we can find a denounce to parents who ""abandon"" their kids to themselves.<br/><br/>As an horror fan, I recognize the effort made to propose a fresh product, with the right direction and atmosphere.<br/><br/>But, all in all, something misses, that flair that could have made it more terrific and unforgettable."

","This movie seems serious and also contains silly contents, but a chain of fear makes it enjoyable. It's common for horror movies to have endless issues or not to have any solutions to end it. This movie is like this, too. <br/><br/>Some grotesque scenes and the last scene in the water cause us much more scares. I especially like the unique camera work which also makes us feel terrified. Although it has some ridiculous settings or some blemish points in it, the unrealistic story and the ghost walking slowly make us creep all over. <br/><br/>I don't recommend anyone who is square to watch it because it emphasizes something sexual, so you'll never be able to enjoy it unless you can laugh sexual things off as a joke. I really want to watch it again with my funny friends."
"aztrshbyz","5","0","3","5 August 2017"," OK for a slow moving psychological horror story
","Generally speaking, I'm not a fan of psychological horror movies because they move a little too slow for me. IT FOLLOWS is not a splatter/gore horror movie - it is a psychological one which means that there is more of a dread feeling throughout than outright horror. <br/><br/>The film concerns a woman who contracts a supernatural entity through having sex. The entity will follow her and try to kill her unless she passes it on to someone else who can live long enough to pass it on further.<br/><br/>I know that there are reviewers who have given this movie a 10 - I can't due to all of the plot holes and contradictions (and I wouldn't even if that was all tied up). Let's just say that there are a lot of things left unexplained or that didn't make sense after it was all said and done. For example, there was never an explanation for the origin of the entity or what happens if you are involved with multiple people.<br/><br/>The acting is okay, but I found certain parts hard to hear. As indicated, it also moves along at a tortoise pace, par for the course for this type of movie. It did keep me kinda interested which is more than I can say for a lot of movies in this type of genre. The soundtrack was also quite effective in building up that feeling of dread.<br/><br/>There might be some folks who are a little put off by the underlying abstinence message - I knew what the movie was about before I watched it so I knew what to expect as far as that was concerned. It is such a common theme that it is almost anticipated in any horror film that involves high school/college folks. This one is no exception.<br/><br/>So, the bottom line is that if you can get past the plot holes and contradictions, it is a pretty good psychological horror movie. If you are looking for a blood fest and/or a lot of jump scares you will definitely need to skip it - it will bore you to tears. For me, it was just okay."

The music, cinematography, editing, writing, and acting are all marvellously wrapped together into a flawless story. <br/><br/>In every scene of the film, even when ""it"" is not seen, we still worry about the safety of the main character.

"ckproductionsni","10","0","1","1 August 2017"," Old School Classic Thrills With Modern Day Jumps!
","I don't know why it has taken me until now to watch this movie, maybe after seeing it surface on Netflix recently, It has charm and stays true to horror without veering off course. I instantly wanted to watch it after seeing a trailer, and I take my horror movies quite seriously (Exorcist, Omen etc being classical and modern day scares being cheap and jumpy- Blair witch really being were it stopped with modern day spooks for me, anything after that era hasn't stuck in mind!) <br/><br/>Once the first 10/20 minutes kicked in it was a captivating blend of aesthetics, modern day teenage drama, American neighborhood, kids taking medication, going to high school and on dates - nothing new there, it reminded me of Netflix's ""Stranger Things"" all throughout the film, in particular in the acting among-st the kids and in elements of soundtrack. The Soundtrack was fantastic and really was part of the driving force of this film which seems to rely on suspense, drama and focusing on the story, old school techniques that the best horror movies used. The film looks very beautiful, it's dark and brooding, and has this really grainy type of feel to it. It seemed like I heard a tiny bits of the ""Halloween"" movie score throughout, which again- instantly made me think and associate this with old fashioned horror movies. Hearing that hammer horror type corny music when you know ""the monster is nearby"" still creates that hand over the eyes effect, even in me. I suppose people are so used to the narrative of the jump scare scenes of horror flicks today they can almost predict how it's going to go in real time. This was semi predictable but brought some fresh new things to the table. <br/><br/>The main character Jay didn't really get a full introduction, or a back story, and I like that they just let her character be, and we go along with her mystique and calm nature. She reminded me of a more rough and tumble version of Hillary Duff, they also keep her respectable throughout the film were she spends a large portion of it half naked running around. When I got half way into the film something in my head said ""this is a little bit like a cheeky nod to STDs"" ,passing on to people maybe without them knowing who has it or what it looks like, it wasn't until I read the trivia afterwards that I made the connection so it was doing it's job right with the theme. <br/><br/>I think I was sold from the part 20mins in where she was in class and staring out the window. Again, it was a little nod to the infamous Halloween scene, and I forgave it for being an overused scene now from other movies abusing it, but this movie took it a little more aggressive and creepy with having it as an old woman, out of place, walking straight towards her. The safety net dropping once you realize the other kids can't see her only the main character.<br/><br/>It kept my attention pretty much 80% throughout the whole film, and for a recent horror flick, that is good going. Combining some jump scenes with realistic special effects alongside old school horror movie techniques it creates a perfect balance of old and new. There wasn't any obvious plot holes or moments when I thought ""I was going with it up until ..."" it all just ran smoothly, and passed the mark in my book. <br/><br/>As for the ending I enjoyed it. It really wasn't going to turn out any other way in my mind other than something like that, and I think that that kind of ending has been used for centuries now, old and new, and it still works!"

And the entity can take the form of people you know. The fact that you don't really know what this entity is, really adds to the horror in my opinion.

"donalscameron","8","0","1","4 July 2017"," ""It Follows"" is a unnerving throw back to the horror classics of the 1970s and 1980s.
","""It Follows"" manages to break away from the majority of unappealing mainstream horror films with a throw back to the classics of the 1970s and 1980s. The film can be seen to draw influence from John Carpenter's Halloween of a high school girl being stalked by a mysterious figure. But make no mistake ""It Follows"" is able to create a truly unique experience, with a combination of Disaterpeace's brilliant musical score and Mike Gioulakis's slow creeping cinematography seeming to simulate a stalker in itself creating an entirely unnerving atmosphere. While the all-round acting in the film is good Makia Monroe's leading performance is a definite standout portraying brilliantly a character fearing for her life at every turn. However, this film is not perfect as it begins to drag towards the mid-point of the film and leaves several questions unanswered. Yet the slower pace towards the middle may be down to director David Robert Mitchell making the film replicate the slow moving nature of the entity itself. Also the fact that some things are left unanswered is also able to add to the mystery around the creature in general. Overall ""It Follows"" is a brilliant horror film that blends great cinematography, music, acting, and directing to create a very effective and unnerving throw back to the horror cinema of the 1970s and 1980s."

"disinterested_spectator","7","0","2","31 March 2017"," Two Absurdities
","When it comes to atmosphere and creepiness, ""It Follows"" does such a good job that one can only be dismayed the inclusion of a couple of unnecessary absurdities.<br/><br/>Jay is a young woman in college who has sex with a guy named Hugh. Then he chloroforms her, takes her to a remote location, and ties her up to a wheelchair. Eventually, a slow-moving, zombie-like being appears, heading in their direction. Hugh explains to Jay that this being will follow her unrelentingly until it catches her. She must avoid this being until she has sex with someone else, thereby passing the curse on to him. The only people that can see this being are those who are presently being pursued, like Jay, and those who have been pursued by it in the past, like Hugh.<br/><br/>Needless to say, it is an act of evil selfishness to pass this curse on intentionally, so we wonder why he didn't just have sex with Jay and then leave her to her doom. The reason, as Hugh explains, is that once it kills Jay, it will then go back to the previously cursed person and follow him. So, Hugh wants Jay to know what is happening so that she will avoid being caught by this being long enough to pass it on to someone else. In other words, he wants Jay to stay alive and pass it on for his own selfish reasons, not out of any concern for her.<br/><br/>The first absurdity in all this is the whole chloroform-and-tied-to- the-wheel-chair bit. Hugh could have had sex with Jay and then driven her out to the remote place, where he could explain what he has done to her while waiting for the being to show up. Furthermore, Jay was sure to tell the police after being abducted that way, which she does. But if he had simply told her the story and let her see the being, the police would have ignored her had she repeated it to them. There would have been less risk for him that way.<br/><br/>Those unnecessary melodramatics aside, the next absurdity is Hugh's encyclopedic knowledge on the subject. In the novel ""Dracula"" and in many vampire movies made based on it, there is a Van Helsing character, a learned professor who, among his many accomplishments, happens to be an expert on vampires. He explains all the rules, the ones involving crosses, mirrors, sunlight, and wooden stakes. So informed, the characters in the movie and we in the audience know what needs to be done. The question is, how did Hugh become the Van Helsing to this being that follows people around, how does he know all the rules? In other words, how does he know that if Jay dies the being will start pursuing him around again? Later, as Jeff, Hugh says he caught the curse from some woman he picked up in a bar whose name he didn't even know. So, how did he know that sex with her was the cause of his troubles? And if the woman in the bar told him, how did she know?<br/><br/>If the curse is passed on through sex, there must have been a first person who acquired it spontaneously and not through sex, otherwise, we would have an infinite regress. There is no reason to think this first person would have known the rules, even if he had lived long enough to pass it on, which seems unlikely, since no one would have told him why some slow-moving person was walking toward him, especially since no one else could have seen it.<br/><br/>There was no need for the abduction scene, and there was no need for Hugh/Jeff to have Van Helsing-like knowledge, only what he had acquired from personal experience, which need not have been much."

"robertalexanderkock","10","0","1","7 March 2017"," A beautiful homage to the great horrors of the past
","I know this movie polarized a lot of moviegoers and divided them into those who expected yet another very predictable but nonetheless fun teeny horror flick with a decent story line and a plot that does bear a lot of potential and those who just went to see it because of its retro looks. I for one am part of the second group and within my long time career of watching horror movies it was always the score that stuck in my head the most. I have to add that I always embark on movies, especially on those which are mostly known to transmit their messages in a very subtle way. Those have ""followed"" me the longest in my life. And I personally think that this is key for movies like 'It Follows'.<br/><br/>Now, I will not go into any more detail about the plot of the movie, since that has been described many times and I don't need to point out any specifics here. I personally did not watch a trailer and just went to see it without any info. Looking back, I even think the story is kind of awkward but I'm also very sure that this awkwardness added a lot of suspense to the movie. Yet, for me the most influential part of the movie was its score. I read a lot of people hated it, simply put. For me, the score was what made this movie stand out, which made each scene a beautifully horrible picture, which added unbearable suspense throughout the movie and kept me on the edge of my seat all the time. It took ordinary dialogues to a level where I was expecting something to happen any second and it took those scenes, which were already dreadful to watch to a point where I was seriously reconsidering if I had ever seen anything like it. <br/><br/>The amazing thing is that the movie can do all this horror while omitting scare jumps. Something I really hate in today's horror movies. I personally think scare jumps are a way to cheat yourself to suspense and discontent. Creating discomfort by simply combining pictures and sounds instead of forcing momentum into the scene, is something that is much harder to achieve and I feel 'It Follows' has outdone not only itself but most of the horror movies of the last 10 years.<br/><br/>Long story short: Do not watch this movie, if you're not able to let yourself go into a film 100%. If you're someone who tries to put everything he sees into a rational and conservative overall picture, stay away from 'It Follows'. However, if you're like me, capable of being sucked into a film with every facet it brings to the table, I can absolutely promise you, you'll love 'It Follows'."

","This is a film that surprised me by the positive, for having moments in which leaves the viewer in suspense waiting for what can happen. The reason for not giving a better rating is because the characters did not search for the source of the ""virus"" that had plagued them throughout the film. The main character simply escaped while she could with her friends have sought out the source of the problem and try to destroy it, in my opinion I think if they had done so the movie would have some more interest and better content.

The main actress had the perfect look and did very well.<br/><br/>One thing I notice, not sure if anyone else did, but did you realize the many (I mean many) shots of teenage legs and feet? I think the director has a fetish or something. At times elements in a film are subtly done but in this case it was such a pattern after a while I realized it also. I made note of about 20 shots of either close ups or angles towards legs and/or feet:).<br/><br/>Also, notice how the director looks pretty close to the goofy guy character in the film that has a hard time to get with the main girl but in the end he does. A bit of an autobiographical film I guess:)."

","It Follows might have been fantastic horror, but it had too many rookie-filmmaker mistakes.<br/><br/>It seems Mitchell tried to make cerebral horror film, which would make people think and be scared at the same time. Well, it didn't quite work out for me. The tension was there, the premise was great, the setting was fantastic and the film didn't gave the audience all the answers, so the viewers could come up with answers themselves. Unfortunately, Mitchell left out too many puzzle pieces so viewer couldn't really understand what kind of questions should one start asking in the first place. <br/><br/>I was scared a bit while watching this film, I felt the sense of hopelessness as the main character probably did, but it wasn't as scary as some other great horror films like The Conjuring or Halloween. Maybe because of the pacing and there was too much time between those scary moments. <br/><br/>I believe that the music score also took away some part of the horror aspect from It Follows. Mitchells relied too much on the music to build up tension and it the music spoiled the moments by pointing out when we should be waiting for something scary to happen. The music could be more subtle, just like the entity which followed.<br/><br/>The editing was very amateurish, I couldn't stand it. Everyone praises the cinematography of ""It Follows"" and it was the main reasons why I really wanted to see this film. I'm total sucker for great cinematography in films. It Follows tried to have great cinematography, but way too many times we had bad shots. Like the camera was shaking, or the cinematographer overdid the panning. Don't get me wrong, It Follows has mostly great shots, but also too many bad ones. <br/><br/>In conclusion: It Follows had interesting setting, relatable characters, great musical score (although overused in some cases), overall good cinematography (as mentioned it had bad shots), but with horrible editing and story which was meant to make audience members think, but left out too many puzzle pieces, which didn't make the film better in anyway.<br/><br/>I would like to believe it might be someone's guilty pleasure movie, but ""It Follows"" isn't even that . It's somewhere in between. It's too bad to be genuinely enjoyable and too good to be ""so bad that it's good""."

I haven't seen a good horror movie since The Conjuring 2, and after reading reviews I thought that this might be a good horror movie to watch.<br/><br/>Now to the plot of the movie.<br/><br/>I get that having sex with someone who carries ""it"" around results in this ""it"" following you, but they never explain what ""it"" actually is. They never explained where ""it"" came from or how this whole thing started. They mention that if ""it"" touches you - you die and then it is a trickle-down effect until it reaches person number 1. They, however, do not ever mention if this has happened, etc. The first scene in the movie is a girl dying from ""it"" but they never show you what happened, and then later in the movie, a boy dies because ""it"" (disguised as his mom) has sex with him.

","At first, why only 3 ? The soundtrack that stands out (the synths of 80s, reminding of Carpenter's early films, and Vangelis). Then it is cinematography - crisp images, smooth camera work, sometimes inventive. And the actors, although young, nevertheless present quite mature professional acting, which deserves to be exploited in the future, but in more serious, intellectual projects.<br/><br/>The idea of something sinister was indeed present at first after seeing the scene with the first victim, but as the film progressed the plot suddenly fell apart into a primitive ""semi- visible ghost"" story and scared teenagers, with the CGI finishing off the mood. One likely would expect to see a grotesque mutant, or a so-called ""eternal metaphorical evil being"" to follow the heroine, from ""Lovecraftian"" dimensions, but instead ... The underlying message of the whole picture boldly suggests the dangers of unprotected sex (while some critics offered even maturation and insecurities before adult life); crumbling neighborhoods of Detroit - social and economic degradation... But using such serious-minded themes within the plot about ridiculous looking ""supernatural"" eventually creates a strong sense of incongruity, and invites mocking - something that a film director with pretensions of making an intellectual cinematic piece should keep in mind and avoid. In overall, this is a pure ""popcorn"" type of entertainment to kill some time, and definitely does not deserve such high rates and attention."

","I have to admit that most of the time I'm not the biggest fan of horror movies which probably makes me a bad judge.<br/><br/>Nevertheless I gave this one a try and I have to say that I felt entertained. The movie understands well to create an atmosphere that makes it easy to get drawn into the actions portrayed. Like other horror movies, it plays nicely with features like camera angles, sounds and filters.<br/><br/>The reason I rate this as a five is thus not the overall atmosphere of the movie, which I appreciate or the solid acting, it is the implausibility of the story. Maybe the story isn't the most important point in a horror movie but for me being afraid is closely linked to the feeling that something similar could happen or that there is at least a plausibility in what happens. In this case there are a lot of questions but barely any answers. What is ""it"", What does it want, How did it start? We don't know. Why do you get rid of it by sleeping with someone? We don't know neither.<br/><br/>Who does know is the boy in the beginning, who seems to have a wide knowledge of aspects like what happens when a victim gets caught (It traces back the other victims, how did he know?). As hard as it might sound but the story is just nonsense and that's what ruins a beautiful atmosphere for me here."

It is true that it has moments that give restlessness but there it stays.<br/><br/>It is true that when the ghosts come at a slow pace, the tension increases, but it lasts so little that soon nothing happens again and again to become bored. It took a lot to start the movie, nothing happened and when it starts, it is so slow that it does not give to scare.<br/><br/>Although technically not bad, neither is it any wonder, let's say it's normal.

Not like when the actress wants to run away, she runs away and comes a moment that feels safe and of course, so that she will look behind her, not man, ghosts never come in the back. This happens several times and that is how we are again. To make matters worse when they go to the pool, in the end, they put a lot of electrical things, no one knows where they came from, of course, that does not matter. But to top it all off I was thinking, when they throw them in the water, they'll throw them all together because if the fuse does not go and it's no good anymore, no, one by one, I imagine the fuse would be bad because if they do not go to Have the least day thought a problem, there the light never jumps. Not to say, when he runs off with the car and only occurs to sleep in the middle of nowhere in the hood. What happens that the ghost does not reach there? Would not it be better to stay in the car?

"milosxlazic","7","0","1","14 November 2016"," ""It"" is an objet petit a: both object-cause and illusory fulfillment of desire
","""It"" has so far been understood properly in review by Andrew Kingsley of The Darthmouth, where he stated that the film captures the abject, but let's not stop at Freud. As someone who has experienced a crippling, unfulfilling desire for another person, as a desiring subject myself, I could completely relate to the agonies of our protagonist.<br/><br/>As seen in one of the first scenes of the movie, she seems to have fulfilled her childhood dreams of driving away and having fun with a guy she likes. But, when he leaves her, she's left in a state of utter agony. Spoken in Lacanian psychoanalytic terminology, the ""objet petit a"" that served the purpose of an illusory object that filled the hole in the chain of signification for her was driven away from her and she was left ""with her hands tied"", to make it obvious that this object is illusory, thus the ""objet petit a"" remains only the hole in the signifying chain, waiting to be filled by another ""objet petit a"", or in English, whatever object momentarily comes to serve the purpose; or anyone else she might experience the same crippling desire for. This desire is never to be fulfilled, but only reproduced, as it is the essence of this hole in the chain of signification.<br/><br/>She being tied implies rape for many, but IMHO it symbolizes the suffocating and immobilizing feeling of inability to ever fulfill our desire for the other. The fact that Paul is the only one able to see our protagonists' ""objet petit a"", her object-cause of desire, is possibly because he understands very well his desire for her, as they knew each other from the young age. The film ending with the two of them holding hands is in this context a positive outcome for both of them, even though the scene seems grim. They might have realized that the crippling desire for the illusory ""objet petit a"" will follow them for the rest of their lives and the possible way to put an end to this agony is by coming to terms with this fact, settling down and accepting yourself and your partner as two lacking subjects. In that case, another illusory ""objet petit a"" appears, serving the purpose of ""covering over"" the hole in the signifying chain produced by insatiability of their desire. This object, at the end, might be: mutual understanding, friendship, love, or whatever signifier one would use to give a name to this illusory object.<br/><br/>To conclude, this is not the best horror I've seen, but I was lured towards it by rather smart plot that apparently did very well for me, according to a fact that I identified so strongly with the protagonist, even though the symbolical depictions of desire that goes after her were, well... Perhaps too graphical. But it was necessary for them to be able to murder their desiring subjects, as possibly a message from the director that we should look after ourselves in our pursuit to fulfill the desires, as this might take us down the roads of exaggeration in sex and drugs or whatever comes, only then possibly leading to rape, STDs' and unfortunate deaths. This is real-life horrific truth about how we function amidst the dialectic of desire, where actually only death is certain, as emphasisingly quoted at the end of the movie."

However, you can still skip it without affecting your understanding of my point. So what I want to say is that I judge a movie with two different ways: objective and subjective. The first one refers on some technical details and generally aspects of the movie that are viewed the same at least by the majority of people. This will most possibly help you understand if you will like the movie. Now, about the second way: it's my personal point of view. What I liked and what I disliked. Ι believe both are important.

Later, she finds out that the curse can be transferred through sexual contact to someone else and that the creature is invisible to everyone except her and the previous carrier of the curse. Knowing these, she and her friends try to save her. While ""It follows"" is generally pretty good, I find the massive praise it receives by older viewers to be hyperbolic (film reminds of older movies so I guess it's because of nostalgia) and of course the negative reviews by teenagers to be unfair. Scariness: 7/10 ""It follows"" is not considered a very scary movie in general. It has two fake jumps scares (the first one will definitely get you) and an actual one that you can easily expect though. Moreover, somewhere, in the middle of the movie there is a really good scare I have to acknowledge (the tall guy). No more scares, the rest of the scariness of the film comes from the ""it is non-stop heading towards you"" concept and the way the music score and the direction supports it. And that's one of the main reasons this movie is praised so much: it tries to make you constantly feel unease and it succeeds! I found myself a lot of times checking the protagonist's surroundings for someone following her. Acting: 6/10 you have seen better, but generally it works out. Bailey Spry as Annie is convincing throughout the movie and gives the best performance of all the cast. Her friends are just OK Music score (not sure how to rate it): As everybody says: ""It reminds of John Carpenter's Halloween electronic score."" As I will say in the subjective part, while it succeeded in building tension when needed, some other times I felt it was distracting and meaningless. But I don't want to disappoint you. Most people like it. Plot and characters: 7/10 if you have read the plot synopsis you may have probably realized it is not something remarkable. Apart from this, there are some little inconsistencies (e.g. where are these kids' parents? Why are they not worried about them missing all the time?), some scenes feel vague (e.g. when at beach looking at the fishermen) and for the most of the movie the characters are on the verge of being what we all hate in horror movies careless and sometimes dangerously impulsive (which makes it easier for the murderer to kill people (and the director). Why does it get 7/10 though? Generally, the plot makes sense and it's unpredictable (except for one jump scare as I said earlier). Moreover, there are some interesting elements that I can't ignore, but it is not for sure that you will notice all of them the first time you watch the film. A lot of them are hidden in the background or require from you to remember faces so that you understand them. The point is that the better your observation skills are, the more you will like the movie. Finally, the end is up to you to decide if it is happy or not. <br/><br/>The subjective part: Unfortunately, I was left kind of cold at the end. It has to do with what I like in horror movies and what I got was not exactly that. As I said although it has that unsettling feeling of being watched it is not that scary in general (although the tall guy scene still gives me the creeps). It also lacked creepiness according to my tastes. Example of creepy moments in movies (SPOILERS): in Mama there is a scene where the woman is in girl's bedroom and sees a human resembling form hidden under a blanket and assumes it is one of the children she has adopted. Then she looks on the other direction doing something and the blanket moves and hides in the wardrobe. Then she hears the voice of both girls in the kitchen. In Insidious the moment that the old lady describes the demon only she can see and her co-worker draws it. About the cinematography, it was well-shot, but I was not impressed or something I found the music distracting in many moments. It actually didn't even sound like music sometimes. An issue I had was about some scenes I thought were vague. I re-watched them and I still don't know what they meant. And about the ending, I believe it's up to you to decide if it's good because it is vague as well. I just feel I didn't understand what happened at the end. I think I am not the only one with this issue. Final verdict: If you are more of a typical horror fan like me you may be a little disappointed by ""It follows"", but I don't think you will hate it either. If you have much experience with horror movies and can appreciate good directing details then you will most probably like it. I am certain it is not a masterpiece (yeah you may have notice that characterization), but either way it's worth your time."

","I liked this movie, more than most of terror movies in the last years. A curse is passed from one person to another through sex. Then, as the title says, a creature begins to follow continuously the cursed one. It doesn't explain what it is, but that is not even necessary; you don't feel the need of it. The creature simply walks, very slowly, assuming the form of any person it wants. I'm tired of those many clichés in terror movies, and this one is not like the others. No cats jumping from closets, no stupid deaths, etc. - although I thought the pool scene pretty stupid, but you can judge by yourself. The shots are interesting - a wide angle camera is used, giving a big space idea. I recommend watching."

","""This thing. It's going to follow you. Somebody gave it to me. And I pass it to you.""<br/><br/>Now this was a movie I really was looking forward to. I'm a horror fanatic who's always on the lookout for films in this genre that leave others far behind in terms of originality and atmosphere (such as ""He never died"", ""Goodnight Mommy"", ""The Babadook"" and ""Spring"" for instance). And many advised me to watch this one. The fact that the hype about this movie was disproportionate, made my expectations go sky-high. And did it meet my expectations? Partially it did and partly it didn't. The fact that I went outside for some fresh air after I had watched it and I looked briefly over my shoulder because of the feeling that I was being watched, means that the atmosphere was quite alright. On the other hand it wasn't really creepy and it felt rather as if I watched a ridiculous educational film about the dangers of sexual intercourse.<br/><br/>The association with sexually transmitted diseases was made quickly. There's only one difference. Here it's not confined to the proliferation of microscopic cells that'll make sure you get such a terrible disease. In ""It follows"" the deadly sexual disease which spreads from one to another, is presented by slow moving and yet sometimes quite terrifying and sinister-looking individuals. The shape ""It"" takes is randomly. It ranges from totally unknown persons, to someone in your immediate circle of acquaintances. There's only one thing the infected person should keep in mind. And that's not to get caught by ""It"". A certain death would be the end result, after which ""It"" focuses on the previous one in the line of infected victims.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film certainly wasn't disappointing. To be honest, in a sense you could say it was brilliant. A confused teenage girl driving off in panic, ending up somewhere on a beach where she makes one last phone call with her parents to say goodbye. The next image is a molested body. The tone was set and it looked like my expectations would be fulfilled. That's what I thought. Because as the movie progressed, the ominous atmosphere and a feeling of discomfort remained, but really frightening it became nowhere. Even worse. They piled up one stupidity after the other. I thought the final piece was pitifully poor and stupid. And again they couldn't resist to finish in the most clichéd manner. The only one who was able to use his brain cells was Paul (Keir Gilchrist). His solution was as effective as dead simple.<br/><br/>But once again, the overall mood was tremendous. That constant feeling of threat reminded me of the better horror movies of the 80s like ""Halloween"" or ""Friday the 13th"". The only difference is that now it's not about a crazy psychopath with a shiny sharp knife, but something supernatural. A kind of insidious disease. The soundtrack with intensive synth music and familiar sound effects were reminiscent of films made in that period. Even attributes of that time were used here. Although I sometimes had the impression that they mixed up two different eras (a black and white TV and an e-reader). Maybe the characters were fans of a vintage interior design. In terms of originality ""It follows"" scores very high. But in terms of implementation, the horror content could be somewhat stronger. Maybe they could use this film as an educational film for today's youth.<br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"
"nitzanhavoc","7","0","2","4 March 2016"," A modern 80's classic. Not a masterpiece, some distinct shortcomings, but great nonetheless.
","As most of us Horror fans are well aware of, shooting a Horror film is usually a very unrewarding experience when fame and fortune are considered. It is not a very popular genre, regardless to a loyal and growing fan-base worldwide. In It Follows, writer-director David Robert Mitchell took on an additional challenge - creating an artistic classic inspired by the prominent differentiated style of the 80's. The sales compared to the budget may have deemed the project a failure, but any and every Horror fan out there who would give it a chance would have an extraordinary experience!<br/><br/>Everything about It Follows feels like a blast from the past, being an obvious tribute to decades past. The story is quite generic - some supernatural creature following and tormenting its victims. The costumes, acting, lighting and cinematography all resemble the distinct style of the 80's. Even the television sets are old, heavy and round-screened, showing old black and white films. The best feature in this regard is the soundtrack - original, retro and authentic, giving the sensation of watching a film from 30 years ago.<br/><br/>Even the socio-political subliminal messages are from a time past. The creature's victims are chosen after having sexual relations, protesting promiscuity and extent sexual freedom. The conversations between the characters (for instance, the ""8 mile speech"" mentioned in the quotes) criticize racism and geographic profiling. These messages, banal as they are in this day and age, were extremely popular back in the 80's.<br/><br/>The acting is right on the spot. Body language, intonations, sensations of fear, even the sex scenes - all seem ""older"" and much less intense and ""in your face"" than modern Hollywood. Considering the cast is mostly in its early to mid 20's, they obviously had to expand their abilities and learn how to make their acting style older and more traditional. I personally enjoy modern Horror and prefer it, yet can't ignore the skills displayed by the cast. Very impressive!<br/><br/>The downside of the film is the use of certain unnecessary cheats. While the female cast doesn't look like porn actresses with completely flat bellies and huge silicon breasts (and even the bathing suites aren't bikinis, not to mention that bathing suites were actually used instead of showing skinny dip scenes which have become quite popular in modern Slashers) - many scenes (especially of the creature) portray nudity. In addition, one of the first scenes shows very violent graphics. I can't help but feel frustrated with this. Both the violence and the nudity are completely redundant and unnecessary, and feel like a silly attempt at forcing an R rating. The eerie and creepy mood would have wanted for nothing without these cheats, and I honestly can't comprehend why Mitchell decided to use them.<br/><br/>However - It Follows gains lots of points for avoiding the use of cheap jump-scares. The situations described in the story and the sympathy with the characters are what make it scary, not stereotypical ""Boo!"" moments. I would have liked to see certain plot twists and a better story development (not to mention a better more climactic ending), but even without the film seems to achieve all that it aims for.<br/><br/>In summary, I would definitely recommend It Follows to any Horror fan looking for something different and more intelligent, as well as to cinema fans who enjoy the artistic nuances. Not the best, but far from the worst!"
"InaneSwine","4","0","3","20 February 2016"," May be one of the better horror films of late, but that's hardly a challenge
","It Follows really doesn't deserve the huge favourable critical reception and positive word-of-mouth that it's getting. It definitely gets some things right: its eerie 80s inspired soundtrack adds to the tension, and there's plenty of tension to be had in some of its scenes. It also has more brains than most witless demonic horror films of the last five-ish years, ever since the popularity of Paranormal Activity suggested to filmmakers that all you need to do is shake a camera and have something go thud before an actor in prosthetic make-up screams at the camera.<br/><br/>However, what It Follows lacks is a decent story. Maika Monroe's competent performance doesn't disguise the lacklustre character she's been given to play, nor the unoriginal and sometimes laughable dialogue. In fact, the film's tension is diffused on several occasions by some unintentional - or perhaps just poorly constructed - comedy.<br/><br/>It may be one of the better horror films to arrive of late, but that's hardly a challenge."

"Mr_attitude","Null","0","3","30 November 2015"," Probably the best horror I've ever seen
","It Follows is one of those movies that relies on atmosphere to carry it...and, unlike numerous others, it succeeds in setting an eerie and unsettling atmosphere that reinforces the story. Between the musical score, the acceptably decent narrative, acting that successfully lends realism and plausibility to a pretty far fetched (though exceedingly uncomfortable) premise, and directing that capitalizes on all of those elements in such a way as to create a very memorable movie that sticks with you after the credits are rolling...this ended up being a movie that lived up to the interest it piqued in me from seeing the trailers. Think of it as The Ring, but with sex as the method of transmission. The correlation with American adaptation of The Ring is appropriate in other ways as well, there is a similarly pervasive atmosphere and an artistic build up that fluctuates between subtle intervals and tense moments that make for a strong overall flow. There is a part of me that thinks teachers should show this in sexual education classes just to make the whole idea of sex as uncomfortable as possible for children and adolescents...because making kids afraid of sex until they are old enough to rationalize that this is entirely fiction might be effective. Hit them when they are young enough and this movie could absolutely implant a bit of fear at the prospect of having sex. Of course I'm not being serious there, since fear of sex is probably about as counterproductive as abstinence-only education...potentially more so. I'm sure there will be mixed feelings from people who watch this one, but personally I found it to be one of the best horror movies I've seen...I like this sort of movie quite a bit though, not that I have seen many along these lines. I'm not going to give anything away. You'll just have to watch it for yourself. Comment"

If you do not have high expectations and are not looking for a fast monster movie you probably will not be disappointed, but on the either hand, you will probably forget it within a few days. The best feature, if you ask me, was the photography, which in many scenes are quite nice! The biggest problem might just be the story itself, which just is kind of nonsense. Add the general stupidity of how the characters and their surroundings react to the events in the movie, again, like in most movies in this category. Another issue that might bother you are timing problems in the narrative, so be prepared for that as well."

","After waiting for months and months to watch this horror movie, I finally managed to sit down and see what all the hype was about. I must admit: this film really deserves hype and praise, but it doesn't quite to the extents it has been. It is certainly refreshing and pleasant to get a break from the ""boo!"" standard of horror movies today, but it isn't as thrilling or amazing as something like ""The Babadook"".<br/><br/>Starting on a positive note Mitchell deserves amazing credit for the atmosphere he creates. Right from the first shot, which is a kind of statement, the style never wavers and maintains a visual coherence that is ultra rare to find in movies at any point in time. The cinematography is really gorgeous, throughout the film I was locked in just looking at these shots and thinking to myself: ""wow that shot was fu**ing great"". The lighting is impeccable and really helps painting frames that are immaculate. The music by Disasterpiece is a major component of the success movie, it's right up there as one of the best scores of the year. These ingredients combined are always serving story and tension and definitely elevate to the film a notch. It just nails the 70s feel, taking a major page from Carpenter's masterpiece ""Halloween"", making the most out of it and giving it a great update.<br/><br/>Ever since last years' ""The Guest"" I have been looking out for Maika Monroe and ""It Follows"" proves everything I said about her a year ago. She embodies her character perfectly and gives a grounded performance that deeply helps give the audience attachment to the character and elevate the credibility of the concept. Regarding the concept, I have to say it is a really smart one that lends itself perfectly to true horror and Mitchell definitely knows how to use it correctly combining it to some brilliant disturbing imagery and not relying on jump scare crap where it could have easily gone. This choice is what ultimately delivers the types of scares and tension I wanted from the film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there isn't enough of that and whilst the screenplay perfectly knows how to setup and get us involved with the characters, it does not know how to fit them coherently in the story which is kind of the core problem of the film. It just never pays off. The tension is always limbering and there are great moments, but time and time again I didn't feel satisfied with what I got when the scene ended. I wanted more. Especially the ending, which is kind of telling of the whole movie, there wasn't enough context there for me to feel the adrenaline rush. I get it that you want to make the movie open ended and surprise me with a non predictable plot, which it definitely has. But there has to be something for me to go ""fu*k yeah"", other than the characters surviving, there has to be that relief or that shock at the end. For example in Halloween (spoilers), Micheal Myers escapes and you don't know where he goes, it really ends on an open note, but you still get that rush of adrenaline and satisfaction because you know Jaime Lee Curtis is kind of out of it.<br/><br/>I do still recommend this film for anyone that wants to have a thrill ride and some good and smart horror, you won't feel in anyway your time was wasted, but you will be lest with a sour taste."

","There seems to be quite a few films recently which hearken back to the late 70's/early 80's in terms of filmmaking style. IT FOLLOWS is one of the films in this mold that capture a certain feeling of nostalgia while also having its foot firmly planted in the present. It's about a vague entity that follows you around after having sex with somebody who also has the same problem. Inasmuch as the Friday THE 13TH series was about abstinence, IT FOLLOWS is in a similar vein, with a heavy dose of John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN and Wes Craven for good measure. The most outstanding part of this film is the subtle approach taken with the horror, letting it build quietly without using the score to jolt you. There was also great care taken with the direction and cinematography that helped to build an atmosphere of tension and dread. Even without being a horror movie (albeit, more of a psychological one), the cinematography and camera-work was excellent, with precise, deliberate movement, slow pans and zooms, etc. It was quite artful, to say the least. I should also mention the outstanding score by Disasterpeace, which captures a feeling I haven't felt since watching HALLOWEEN. So, at least on the surface, IT FOLLOWS has a lot going for it. However, I do ask a little bit more from movies I watch than to impress me visually and aurally, and apart from these qualities, IT FOLLOWS was quite banal. The acting was decent, although no one really stood out from the rest. The potential in the setup for this ""it"" to be anything or anyone allowed for a few good sequences, but it also meant that the narratively was a little too linear for my tastes. It boils down to have sex, wait, and run. And for a 100 minute film, I expected more. There wasn't even an underlying emotional subtext like was in THE BABADOOK. Still, despite being bored through parts of it, the film does manage to pull together for a decent (and appropriate) finish. I would recommend people to see this, but don't go in expecting something revolutionary. There is a little bit of subtext about abstinence/STDs that can be read into IT FOLLOWS and, courtesy of a CHARADE billboard, possibly some meta-commentary on artificiality. However, IT FOLLOWS works perfectly fine as a stylistic exercise that aspires to little more than imitating its cinematic forebears, and does an admittedly good job at it."

","Pretty entertaining movie, though it was not particularly scary. The following sentences may contain spoilers (but probably not, especially if you've watched the trailer). The main character basically had to pass on the curse (which is some kind of entity that always walk after you) by sleeping with someone. Why could she not pass it to a guy friend and the whole group could put their money together and send him on a holiday to Thailand? The curse would travel faster than the monster would be able to walk. Perhaps i'm wrong; it might not occur to young members of the American middle class that they came pass it on the someone abroad. Still, the main character and her friends are not really that imaginative -- she could also have slept with a trucker..Either way, I gave this movie a 6 because, if you choose to look away from the obvious plot holes, it's a pretty entertaining movie.

","After teenager Jay sleeps with her new boyfriend Hugh for the first time, she learns that she is the latest victim of a fatal curse that is passed from victim to victim via sexual intercourse. <br/><br/>Death, Jay learns, will slowly make a way toward her as either a friend or a stranger. <br/><br/>Jay's friends don't believe her delusional rantings, until they too begin to see the paranormal phenomena, and band together to help her flee........<br/><br/>The first thing you will sense when watching this movie, is that phenomena known as déjà Vu. Especially if you are a fan of the films of John Carpenter.......namely Halloween.<br/><br/>And it's no way a criticism of this brilliant, slow burning horror. <br/><br/>From the setting, to the wonderful soundtrack, Halloween has its mark over almost everything that this film has to offer.<br/><br/>But what the makers of the film have done, have encouraged the viewer to see the bigger picture, so during the second act, you cannot help but to pay as much attention to the background, as you do to the foreground and the characters paranoid rumblings.<br/><br/>At times, this could almost be a sort of meta-sequel to the movie clichés of the atypical eighties slasher movie.<br/><br/>One of the most well known was the penalty for teenagers having relations with one another, namely, they were succumbed to by the villain of the picture. <br/><br/>Here, it's as almost the film is saying 'look, you didn't listen, you little hipsters, so we are gonna go all Terminator on you......we will not rest.....ever......until you are dead'.<br/><br/>With a great concept, has to be equal narrative, and for the most part, it delivers, and instead of going for the predictable, abhorrent jump shocks, we get the delicious eerie feel of seeing someone from afar, and it just getting closer, and closer.<br/><br/>It lets itself down slightly with the finale, feels like it's been ripped from the pool scenes of Gremlins and Let The Right One In, but all in all, it's a very disturbing experience.<br/><br/>Almost a metaphor/warning about the dangers of unprotected intercourse.<br/><br/>Well worth seeing."

","This is a good horror movie, but it is being over-hyped. It is often creepy and sometimes downright scary (and I have no problem with the lack of explanation for ""It), but the director has intentionally refrained from making it a relentless exercise in terror by giving occasional breaks to the tension as if to relieve the spectator. In other words, it doesn't really deliver the promise of the terrifying opening sequence. In my book, it is not as great as Babadook for example, but of course much better than an average horror movie. I tend to agree with the Village Voice review that this is a horror movie made for people who say they don't like horror movies."

","1. You could certainly do a lot worse for 12 bucks.<br/><br/>2. If you can't appreciate the hipster feel satire, you will hate this movie as it insists entirely upon it.<br/><br/>3. The soundtrack tries hard. And is just modern enough to get the point of generational transition across.<br/><br/>4. This movie is not scary at all. It's not.<br/><br/>5. It's a cool joke about the trite use of sex as a deterrent to whatever... <br/><br/>6. Slow monster. STDs are becoming less scary and this expresses that perfectly. I have seen several Christian critics say it has a ""good message"" and that's why the movie is great. These people got duped. The film prays on hipsters and is written by cannabalistic hipsters. There is no deep meaning.<br/><br/>7. Camera work is fantastic and generous........<br/><br/>8. Calling the dude ""Paul"" is a nice nod to the boyfriend in Halloween. (1978, not that disgrace by Rob Zombie) The ambiguity of when this happens is great. <br/><br/>Obviously different people see different things. The characters are in the late 70's for sure. But their environment is on a 50 year timeline loop. Modern cars, a Kindle, old cars, black and white box t.v. (another nod to Carpenter).<br/><br/>9. Just beware of the niche""iness"" of it's intended unintended intentional unintentional tendencies to tend to be a low budget horror movie unworthy of praise. <br/><br/>And remember... Hipsters don't know they're hipsters... They could be anyone at any time... Even you..."

","""It Follows"" has become the most talked about horror film of the season thanks to rave reviews and a ridiculous amount of press from not only genre outlets but mainstream ones as well. With so much hype surrounding it, I deemed it necessary to drop everything and see it as soon as possible. As I left the theater, I couldn't shake the feeling that while what I saw was both engaging and thought- provoking it still somehow missed the mark of true terror.<br/><br/>In ""It Follows,"" a teenager (Maika Monroe) has disturbing visions following a strange sexual encounter. She has the inescapable feeling that someone -- or something -- is after her.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but be intrigued with the premise of what has now become a juggernaut of a horror film. As a Christian who promotes sexual abstinence before marriage, the concept of ""It Follows"" caught my attention right away. It's like taking one of the most important ""rules"" of slasher films and really pounding it home.<br/><br/>""If you have sex, you're going to die!""<br/><br/>Several viewers will take ""It Follows"" as a metaphor for the endless spreading of the AIDS virus through unprotected sex. Others might look at it as a warning that premarital sex never ends well. There's always emotional baggage we're left with after the experience. Either way, there's a lesson to be learned whether it was intentional or not.<br/><br/>Is ""It Follows"" actually THAT scary like everyone else says it is? Not really. Is there an ever-present sense of dread and gloom? I would say so. The main problem with the film is that you're expecting some over-the-top controversial ending thanks to all the hype the media is throwing at us. Sadly, I think most people will find the conclusion unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Another issue I had with ""It Follows"" is the way the horror is taken out of the lead character's head. At first, only she can see the evil coming for her and that provides a certain personal or first- person psychological appeal to the film. Once the ""entity"" manifests itself to the others like a poltergeist, you start to feel as if you're just watching another typical supernatural thriller. The novelty of the whole concept just wears off during those segments.<br/><br/>The movie is rated R for disturbing violent and sexual content including graphic nudity, and language. There was definitely way more nudity than there needed to be in order to get the point across. It's not sensual nudity, either. There's nothing attractive or stimulating at the flesh we see flash across the screen. The violence is gory and includes a few head shots and blood splatters.<br/><br/>""It Follows"" succeeds in its suspenseful set-up and establishment of an atmosphere of dread and panic. Unfortunately, it fails to deliver any real closure at its conclusion. Some will find this fitting, where others will leave the theater unfulfilled. I was caught somewhere in the middle of dissatisfaction and contentment. Although I enjoyed the basic premise and the unique blend of 1970s and 1980s nostalgia with present day technology, I was left wanting more in the horror department."

","I actually enjoyed it. It was pretty tense when it wanted to be and the atmosphere was pretty suspenseful. Very little jump scares unlike most horror films these days and more among the lines of the terror that could happen. Had a bit of a late 70s/early 80s tone to it as I was somehow reminded of Halloween. I can't help but also wonder if Twilight Zone was an inspiration. There was just something about it felt like it could be among those many scenarios. Scary, subtle, fun, though leaves you questioning some of the film's standards of how this particular monster works specifically beyond the explained rules. How does it kill? Thrusting your leg aggressively? At some points it makes no sense, or at least to most horror movie standards but this only makes it interesting to question more (should there be a sequel) should you be one like me that overthinks such topics. And seriously? Kids, what is the deal with your logic? I know you're teens, but geez. Some of the choices, guys... not sure which is dimmer: your choices or the gloomy camera lenses. ....Clearly I was somewhat invested in these characters haha. The music was interesting to listen to-- old electronic synths mixed with a bit of spooky ambiance. Occasionally there are sounds reminiscent of a Super Mario game and bled a sense of John Carpenter somewhere in our midst. Overall the the film is clearly flawed in it's way, but still manages to keep an interesting, surreal take on the genre.<br/><br/>My rating? A C+ Worst. STD. Ever.<br/><br/>Now for my major question: Where do I get myself one of those seashell eReaders?"
