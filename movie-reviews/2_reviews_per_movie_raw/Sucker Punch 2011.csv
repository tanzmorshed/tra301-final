","Don't look at the movie the way it is. You can hate it for whatever reasons you like but this movie isn't just stupid, soulless and pointless sexual fantasy. There is more thought put into it than you could ever imagine. Too bad critics panned the movie for the things that couldn't comprehend and the audience went with it.<br/><br/>The whole thing is a big fantasy that does not exist or happening in the real world. The movie is actually about Sweet Pea(Abbie Cornish). She is the star of the show. Snyder made that very clear from the start. Babydoll(Emily Browning) is a figment of Sweet Pea's imagination. She is the physical embodiment of Sweet Pea. She is the 5th thing. She is the guardian angel that Sweet Pea created to deal with her trash life. The entire film is a reflection of the internal struggle of Sweet Pea. That's why she is the one who's narrating the film. The stuff that we've seen with Babydoll during the first act, that's all Sweet Pea acting out her past trauma in her mind, just as she was taught to do in the mental institution. That's why the movie opens on a stage that direct parallel to how Sweet Pea is acting out that same trauma on a stage when Babydoll first arrives in the mental institution aka the theater. After that, the lobotomy comes, the key to everything that happens in the movie. Reimagined through Babydoll perspective, Sweet Pea disassociates from reality when the needle plunges into her brain, retreating into her mind in the same way she's taught to by Dr. Gorski. She's not in the real world anymore. This is also what happened in Sweet Pea's real life. And the effect of that lobotomy is the goddamned movie. Yes, this movie is the result of a lobotomy. Just one big subconscious coping mechanism for Sweet Pea to find peace. And this girl is able to interrupt the lobotomy, intruding on her own story. She's even able to repurpose the accidental killing of her sister into a deliberate and necessary sacrifice on her sister's part to save her. In this second layer of fantasy, Sweet Pea imagines herself and the rest of the girls working in a brothel, objectified and lusted after by an audience. This mirrors us tuning in to see these girls perform for us in various outfits. This connection is made clear from the opening of the film, which lets us know that we're the audience watching all this unfold on stage. By choosing to watch the movie, we are complicit in everything that's happening. Of course, this doesn't mean to condemn you for wanting to see nubile girls kicking ass. What this movie is really about is the difference between empowerment and exploitation. This is represented through three layers of fantasy, first was the mental institution, second is the brothel, third is the fantasy-action scenes, each exploring a different set of social values, each aligning with different phases of the feminist movement. First up is a grim incarnation of the '60s -the mental institution- set during the second wave of the feminist movement, when gender inequality was much more widespread. That gender inequality is amplified in the second world -the brothel- which takes us back even further, to a time when women were literally treated like property. And finally we have the pop culture world -the world of today, action scenes- which imagines Babydoll's dancing through various aspects of modern geek culture, dressing the girls up in all the typical fetishistic attire we've come to expect video games, TV, movies, etc... Sweet Pea is aware of how sick this is and rejects that Baby Doll's dancing could possibly be empowering. It's only through seeing its effect on men does she start to see how much power they really have, as the girls start taking back the control they've lost by using men's objectification of them to their advantage. By embracing their sexuality instead of fearing it, they learn that their inherent femininity can be better used as a means of holding men under their sway. Suddenly, it's the men who become helpless instead of them. Point being, men may be in a position to physically overpower women, but women have the power to psychologically overpower men, thus inverting history's long-standing power dynamic between men and women. This is then mirrored to very much the same effect in the action fantasy scenarios - a symbolic gesture on Snyder's part to show women taking back geek culture, which men have been dominating with their boy club mentality and pervasive misogyny for far too long. This is demonstrated further once we cut back to Babydoll's lobotomy after Sweet Pea has found peace. While Sweet Pea busy imagining that she's taking the magic school bus to a better world, Blue has plans of his own. But its no use, she's already escaped, even if it's only mentally. Sweet Pea sacrifices her body -Babydoll- and retreats into the comfort of her own mind, a paradise over which nobody has control of but her. Blue may have control over her body, but without her mind, he has nothing. The importance of this is also apparent during Babydoll's encounter with the High Roller, who recognizes that the choice to truly be with someone lies with you and you alone. As the scene with the High Roller reaffirms, the distinction between exploitation and empowerment all comes down to personal choice. And that is just half of the point this movie trying to make. Women deserve just as much control over their bodies as they have over their minds. You can interpret this movie so many ways, it's beyond belief. It gives you so many options to think. It's really funny that the one who made this kind of a movie and the one who is trying to defend it is a male. But it is what it is. If this movie made by someone like Stanley Kubrick, probably everyone would have tried to decipher the depth of it and wouldn't have even minded the bad reviews.<br/><br/>It's really sad that people turn off their brains and see everything literal, and never uses their brain to read the images that appear on the screen when they see a Snyder film."

","In a world filled with mindlessly violent movies and flimsy plots with practically nothing to substantiate the actions of the characters, I went into this movie looking for mindless violence and girls-with-guns escaping reality and an asylum and not much more.<br/><br/>What I found instead was apparently missed by a lot of other people out there. I read reviews that said this movie was soulless and pointless sexual fantasy. I don't know what movie they sawbecause that wasn't this movie.<br/><br/>This movie wasn't about a girl escaping reality by setting up a fantasy within a fantasy and using those fantasies to escape an institution in reality. This movie was about a young woman who had accepted a hopeless fate, but is saved by someone she eventually calls an angeltold from the angel's point of view. This is not Babydoll's story. Yet she still brought down the beast.<br/><br/>This movie was not about a boy's fantasy about girls in short skirts and fishnets holding big guns and a really cool sword. For one thing, boys tend to like bloodshed. Girls tend to like looking awesome. (Please note, I am using the phrase ""tend to like"" on purpose. I do like bloodshed on occasion and I am a girl. I know those of the male set of the species who also like to look awesome. I'm making a separate point here.) There is very little bloodshed in this movie. The steam-work soldiers did not bleed. They're already dead. The other creatures, the robots, the dragons There's practically no blood shed within the fantasy. There is a highly sexual look to the movie. Babydoll is sexually objectified by her stepfather and the orderlies and the guards. Is it any wonder that her first reality-escaping-fantasy is a brothel? And then, within that fantasy, she uses her ability to dance provocatively to render the men motionless, thoughtless, and incapable of noticing anything else around them. It's called a power trip. Every woman wants to be sexy. Every woman wants to be that capable of holding every man's attention that completely. It was Babydoll's way of using that sexual objectivity as a weapon. And that weapon carries into the next level of her fantasy, becoming a handgun with cartoonish animal charms dangling - taking a weapon and adding a distinctively feminine touch to it - and a really sweet katana engraved with intricate and delicate designs.<br/><br/>This movie was about heroes and self-sacrifice. It was not about women in lingerie holding weapons. It was about using everything you have to fight for freedom - and that your freedom is not the only freedom worth fighting for. This is not Babydoll's story. It may not be yours. But it's still worth telling.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and one more thing: If someone fights for your right to breathe free, fight for the next person's right. You won't know whose story this is until the end."

","Nearly every review you read for this film will say the same thing, it's a 'love or hate' movie, and there's a very good reason for this. ""Sucker Punch"" is not the film you were expecting, whatever that might have been, particularly if you were expecting a hyper-masculine affair a la ""300"". If anything it is hyper-feminine; at its core this is a movie about women struggling against the evil male influences in their lives. That doesn't mean it isn't loaded with action - it really is, and it is beautiful, but if you're looking for an easy watch, this isn't for you. In terms of sheer originality, this movies narrative style is right up there with classics like Pulp Fiction and Memento, but there is a downside to this - you need to keep an open mind. If you can't watch this movie, at least once without - and this may sound weird, but you'll get what I mean when you watch it - demanding to know exactly what is going on, right the hell now, it will lose you, and it won't get you back. But if you can keep an open mind, right till the end, at the very least it will give you a lot to think about<br/><br/>On the other hand, don't go thinking that is all it has to offer. It is visually stunning in a way that makes director's like Michael Bay and (dare I say it) James Cameron, look like blind toddlers with a handy-cam strapped to their heads. As for the music, it's not often I'm afraid of giving spoilers for a movies soundtrack, I'll say that much, and every track fits the movie perfectly.<br/><br/>I'm going to shoot myself in the foot here, but when it comes to this movie, don't listen to the reviews, and just go see it. I really think time will tell with this one on that front. I can't promise you'll like it, but I can promise you'll remember it 6 months from now, and how many movies can you say that about?"

"GeneR777","8","467","693","1 April 2011"," Why Sucker Punch Works and why it will rock DVD sales
","I originally wrote a review the day after I saw Sucker Punch. I panned it. To me my initial feelings were rather lukewarm at best. <br/><br/>But then I gave it some time. <br/><br/>And as I went through my days afterward my mind would wander back to the story and think about the visual food for thought. <br/><br/>Yeah, the girls are hot. Yeah, the action is over the top, but if you look at the emotional landscape that is being explored in a more literal fashion via the action then yeah, this is a pretty cool idea. <br/><br/>Sometimes films come along that are a ""sucker punch"" in terms of originality. The general public usually reacts negatively to it which leads to poor box office results. But later on the audience has had a chance to digest what was given and revisits the film and breaths new life into it. <br/><br/>My prediction is that such a situation will happen with Sucker Punch. It'll probably not recoup its initial budget at the box office. People will flood the IMDb forum with reasons why it did not work. We will probably see about a few dozen threads at least where people will vent their reasons why they hate the film and why you too should not see it.<br/><br/>But given some time it will recoup via video sales and other distribution deals. <br/><br/>Why? <br/><br/>Because it's still a solid story. The style of the movie is an Otaku's wet dream, but overall result is still the same: it does surprise and give ample food for thought. <br/><br/>Think of it as stylized parable about repression, personal will and sacrifice. Because sooner or later after all the negative backlash and reviews blow by those emotional messages will be all that will be left. <br/><br/>And people will remember it for that reason."

","Here's the thing about this movie, its demanding. You have to be able to let go, realize that it's stylized after a modern comic book (of the adult genre), and just go with the movie. Let it take you on its ride, which is a beautiful/wonderful thing.<br/><br/>You also have to pay attention. This movie is layered in metaphor and is way more cerebral than one might expect. You have to work to understand what's going on and part of that work is letting it take you away. <br/><br/>If you can do this, and your friends can do this, you will have hours of conversation afterwards about what it all means, what the metaphors mean, and what was actually happening in the 'prime' reality of the insane asylum. <br/><br/>If you can't do this you will probably think the movie is stupid, contrived, and pointless.

"Loving_Silence","8","565","919","17 March 2011"," A love it or hate it type of film.
","I personally enjoyed the film and I am a fan of Zack Snyder's previous films (Watchmen,300,and Dawn of the Dead). The visuals were pretty much stunning with very few exceptions, but they are easily forgiven and not distracting at all. The acting wasn't anything ""Oscar"" worthy, but then again it shouldn't be. The performances were very good for an action film and I like it that way. This films definitely attracts the teenage male demographics, who like action packed films filled with hot women. This film, however is not for everyone. Some people might not like CGI, some women might be offended that this film is very shallow, violent, and very degrading towards women.This is definitely the type of movie you'll either love or hate.<br/><br/>My only problem with the movie is that the story doesn't seem fully realized If you want to keep me interested you will need a lot more than 20 minutes of fantasy CGI sequences sprinkled throughout a 120 minute trek However go in this movie expecting to have a lot of fun! Overall the movie has stunning visuals, great action scenes, and worthwhile acting. I definitely recommend this movie to people looking to have a good time."
"FTL_Ian","10","202","318","1 May 2011"," An action-extravaganza that is haunting, beautiful, polarizing, and brilliant.
","After absorbing myself in the world of Zach Snyder's ""Sucker Punch"" for a while, including one viewing at IMAX, one in my local theater, and multiple listens to the soundtrack, I felt the unusual calling to dump my thoughts out regarding this haunting, beautiful, polarizing, and brilliant film.<br/><br/>From the first trailer I saw, I'd been anticipating the release. Usually this is bad, as it means my expectations are built up and it will take an outstanding performance to meet those expectations. Turns out, Sucker Punch is everything I'd hoped it would be, and more. Some would say that in art we see what we want to see, though maybe it's true also that we see what we are prepared to see. Here's what I saw and felt about the film, why it resonated with me and why many people didn't like it: Within the first five minutes, I knew I was in for a treat. The film opens with an excellent cover of ""Sweet Dreams"" by the film's lead actress. The initial scenes are otherwise silent and the storytelling is all visual. Yes, you're about to experience a film that is basically a 120-minute music video. But that's not all. It's also an action extravaganza AND it's cerebral to boot.<br/><br/>Right out the gate, from as early as the opening sequence (where we enter through a state and later rain on a car window forms the movie's title), this film announces that you should shut off your disbelief. It's fantasy at all levels and doesn't have to make sense to entertain or ask provocative questions, both out loud and suggested.<br/><br/>Thank goodness for the fantasy elements as had this been a movie about an escape attempt from an abuse-steeped asylum, it would have been immeasurably depressing. Snyder's vision protects the audience from what Baby Doll, Sweet Pea, and the rest were experiencing in the ""reality"" of the film probably more effectively than Baby Doll's fantasies protected her from those horrible experiences. As it is, the film is sad enough in its portrayal and suggestion of certain negative themes like incarceration, lobotomies, aggression, rape, corruption, and betrayal. On the other hand, it's also a film that is both empowering and moving.<br/><br/>In contrast to the dark themes, we also have several positive themes like the individual's search for freedom, teamwork, giving, love, forgiveness, risk, and courage. This film likely upsets many viewers because it doesn't exactly have a happy ending. (An approach which tends to spell failure at the American box office.) I enjoy the apparent contradictions it presents to the audience. One popular debate is whether the film is empowering to women. I think this debate in particular misses the point of the film, and takes too much at face value, but it does show how polarizing the movie is.<br/><br/>The conversation, both internal with yourself and external with others, about what is portrayed in the film can be difficult for one to consider, which is likely why it's a turn-off for so many. The critics may be upset by the questions it provokes about themselves. Cognitive dissonance encourages them to just forget all the issues, label the film a piece of garbage, and move on. Other viewers were likely upset by the film's darkness - it certainly made me uncomfortable, but that doesn't mean the movie was bad. For those of us looking deeper, there are all manner of important questions provoked.<br/><br/>People are being abused. What are you doing about it? Is reality a prison? If reality is a prison, as the trailer for the film states, what does that make you? Why are you here? Are you here to be ""corrected"" or to escape? Do you want to be free, or should you just shut up and let the guards continue to take advantage of you and the other prisoners? What will it take to escape? Are you willing to risk your life in the quest for freedom? Is Sucker Punch really just a action-extravaganza with no plot (as many critics would suggest), or is it a subtly and cleverly presented art film about your evolution and self-empowerment? The film even asks a series of provocative questions out loud in the final narration. I'm a panentheist, and I don't claim to know what Zack and Deborah Snyder believe, but my interpretation of the final narration is that it is reminding people of the divine dichotomy. We are individuals, but we're all connected to all-that-is. The world's horrors and beauty were created by us, collectively. What we see around us is a reflection of our collective beliefs. The contrast exists so you can continue to choose what you want. Will you consciously choose to evolve, expand, and therefore grow all-that-is? The film explains this by announcing that you have all the weapons you need and encourages you to ""fight"". Leave the realm of living life by default, and begin working towards freedom. Gather your tools (map, fire, knife, key) and don't forget the fifth element - love. Prepare yourself to lose everything and gain the perfect victory.<br/><br/>The fight is not with swords and guns against horrible monsters outside you, but inside yourself. It's your task to vanquish your fear. That will set you free internally, which eventually will help free you (and the rest of us) externally. You may not make it out alive, but all-that-is will benefit from your efforts.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch wasn't a mind-blower like The Matrix, but it was an entertaining, well-made action film with an intellectual layer and depth, for those who were prepared to receive it. I left the theater with conflicting feelings about what I'd seen. I liked that. It's a stunningly beautiful and poignant film. It was exactly what the trailer promised and more. Oh, and the soundtrack is pretty great, too! Consider me a fan.<br/><br/>4.5/5 for the theatrical version. I'm looking forward to the director's cut."

","""Sucker Punch,"" the latest barrage on the senses from writer-director Zack Snyder (""300"", ""Watchmen"") is his first film that's based on his own source material. And it proves to be quite stunning definition of pop filmmaking. In a triumphant marriage of style and tone, Snyder has created his own ""Kill Bill"" by going deep down into the rabbit hole. A glorious pastiche of colour, CGI and kinesis, ""Sucker Punch"" even through its obvious flaws, has set a new bar for graphic storytelling that attempts to transplant the purity of imagination onto the cinema screen.<br/><br/>Essentially cohering around a simple premise -- hot chicks kicking ass and taking names, the film's bravura opening charts Baby Doll's (Emily Browning) institutionalisation by a wicked stepfather after her mother's death and her introduction to the asylum where damaged young women are sent to be kept away from society. She meets the people-in-charge, Blue (Oscar Isaac) and Dr. Gorski (Carla Gugino) as well as the other girls in the institute: Rocket (Jena Malone) and her sister Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Amber (Jamie Chung) and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens).<br/><br/>The story that follows Baby Doll reveals a larger canvas of a clever narrative conceit that coincides three realities together (""Inception"" comparisons, tread lightly); the first being the asylum, the second is a burlesque brothel run by Blue and trained by Gorski and the final and most resplendent one is Baby Doll's hyper reverie focused on destroying the forces of evil -- be it shogun titans, zombie Nazis or killer androids. The darker the reality preceding it, the deeper and more risky the wormhole of fantasies go. There is a real sense, despite its tremendous parade of visual set-pieces that Snyder wanted a narrative strong enough to endure the weight of spectacle, and in many respects he has. He uses the age-old device of character quests to propel the plot, peppering it with familiar consequences until he doesn't. The flow culminates in an intriguing final act that sets it a mark higher than anyone would have expected, or even needed from a film that already proudly wears its stripes as pure escapist entertainment.<br/><br/>Snyder goes the way of Tarantino in appropriating and amalgamating artistic and stylistic influences from the most conspicuous of genres and mediums. Within the real world or whatever the relative equivalent of what exists in this film's dark and twisty tone, the film uses templates in the vein of sexploitation female prison grind-house features from the 60s and 70s like ""Love Camp 7"", ""99 Women"", ""Caged Heat"" and the grandmother of them all, 1950's ""Caged"". As the film progresses into its action-oriented enterprises, it quickly recalls the dizzying array of cut-scenes from video-games and punk anime-style design in how it encompasses the digital environment. Snyder's thematic goal is to situate the idea of imagination as a coping mechanism for terror, a concept seen recently in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and ""Tideland"". The landscape of the mind is uniquely realised here by Snyder, who etches a remarkable amount of detail into each CGI frame, an hyperbolised celebration of artifice and invention that is at once magnificent and exhilarating as it is compelling and spellbinding.<br/><br/>Werner Herzog once posited that the dearth of new and unique imagery that do not reflect the times we live in will be the death of civilisation. If anything, ""Sucker Punch"" truly defines the generation of filmmaking we exist in -- a sophisticated and passionate emblem that delivers an overload of sugar high through the ideals of creating and maintaining a creative medley of pop-culture influences, bridged together with keen commercial sensibilities. Suddenly, Snyder holding on to the helms of the next Superman film makes more sense than it ever did."

Yes it's not without flaws, yes it can be predictable (especially the ""5th item"") but it doesn't mean that it isn't everything that most films seem to miss these days: fun. <br/><br/>Fun isn't usually associated with child abuse and an asylum but that is where the curtain opens the audience at. An opening silence gives great anticipation, a tragedy occurs and protagonist Baby Doll is shunted into an asylum by her step-father, where she awaits lobotomy in five days' time. <br/><br/>It should be said at this point that this review is coming from someone who openly loathes the style over substance limbo of an era in which we live, what with CGI and 3D being used as an excuse for anything considered a showcase for this technology.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch boasted a similar exercise course of stylish nonsense yet the finished result left this reviewer in a state of pleasant surprise; the concept was highly original – though sprinkled with an influx of other influences which ultimately could have been the films downfall had the context they been used in feel more of a parody than a series of dream sequences. Orcs, dragons and robots have never been more refreshing out of their native genres.<br/><br/>As the visuals go, there was never going to be an issue there. It's easily Snyder's best looking film to date, and for a written debut the plot is on par with the heavily –action orientated 300 in that it takes a back seat once the films' issue has been established. It's only noticeable dent in its armour is the characterisation, or rather lack of characterisation. For a film nearing the two hour mark the audience are relatively unrewarded when trying to relate to any of the five heroines' of the story. <br/><br/>It may be great to see that Baby Doll, Blondie, Sweet Pea, Amber and Rocket haven't been assigned to overused archetypes – that would be taking the easy route, yet there's not even been a road taken here. The characters as such remain relatively hollow, being left as shell-less, albeit undeniably attractive characters. <br/><br/>There's not even, what you could coin as a 'Fenster' wherein a character with next to nothing about them can morph into something noticeable, even memorable. They are what could be the fully-fledged realisation Pulp Fiction's Fox Force Five, each an assassin with their own weapon speciality; perhaps this is how the audience is supposed interpret their personalities, each instrument being reflective of the character using it. <br/><br/>That is my only complaint, everything else did, as Big Daddy put it: ""Knock(ed) me for a loop"", with three particular, but unspoiled scenes, breaking a monotony that had infected the infinite amount brainless action films that have preceded Sucker Punch – and sadly continue to follow after it. While the scenes aren't anything ground-breaking they play to Zack's strengths – detaching from the action so it does not cease to stand impressive next time round and focusing on the realism that confronts them back in the reality. <br/><br/>Critics have mauled it, calling it ""dull"", ""senseless"" and even ""plot less"" yet the fact many fans have interpreted it as having meanings on a deeper level, particularly the importance of Sweet Pea's character, suggests there may have been a certain naivety from critics - a definite contribution to its growing cult status (there is an excellent interpretation on the IMDb Message Board that is worth a look). You could also throw weapon argument mentioned above into the mix for further evidence of such ignorance - I also stand guilty of missing this possibility.<br/><br/>The film has also been accused of being overtly sexist, but drawing another parallel to 300, 300 men are seen topless and not a single complaint is raised. But five scantily-clad women and one imaginary brothel are seen and all hell has broken loose. 300 got a reasonable 60% on Rotten Tomatoes and Sucker Punch just 22%; both are relatively balanced in terms of their stories, character's and direction yet the reception of each is hugely unbalanced. It effectively asks who the sexist ones really are.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is misunderstood, not question about it. It's not the genre changing cult films that Blade Runner or Donnie Darko are, but it certainly deserves the fans that it has generated and I for one eagerly anticipate the Extended Cut to see what else it has to offer."
"johnnymacbest","4","599","1102","25 March 2011"," A fistful of mediocrity.
","With 300, Zack Snyder has made it abundantly clear that his movies dazzle they eyes, indeed they do, but his characters never engage the audience in a personal and emotional level. And Sucker Punch is just that. A visually dazzling collage of mental insanity taken to the extreme with a fairly interesting premise that looks promising on the surface, but never truly lets you sink your teeth into the inner workings of the main character.<br/><br/>Emily Browning plays Babydoll, a blond bombshell who is placed in a mental institution by her cold stepfather, and is then seen trying to persuade the orderlies into lobotomizing her to keep her from giving details surrounding a tragedy in her life. However, Babydoll begins to create a dreamworld in which not only to pass the time, but to figure a way out of the asylum.<br/><br/>As if that makes any sense whatsoever, here are the main problems with Sucker Punch that's been plaguing modern cinema; no plot and character development. Barely any of the characters that the protagonist meets are developed. They're just static talking heads spouting out lines that are trying to hammer into the audience that they are more than just clichÃ©'s and cardboard cutouts. The acting feels stiff and artificial with no sense of tension or suspense. You never feel that the characters are in real danger of any kind. It just goes thru the motions and despite having a nice premise to go on, the film feels like a half-ass-ed attempt to be something new and fresh.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch has some merits. The special effects and action scenes are impressive. I did get a kick out of some of the battle scenes which are nicely choreographed and executed with lots of explosions. Watching it is sort of like looking at a silent film on steroids but minus the heart and soul of that bygone era.<br/><br/>The incredible aesthetic beauty and action choreography are a lot impressive than Snyder's 300. But the problem with Sucker Punch is that even in a fantasy film, or any action film for that matter, you have to put effort into making the audience care for your characters no matter how good looking the action and special effects are. You simply won't care who lives or dies in this film. At some point, you have to try to make the audience care. This film simply never does.<br/><br/>I think that I got my point across perfectly clear regarding this film. If it entertained you, fine, then it did it's job. The problem is is that there's nothing remotely remarkable about this film aside from the visual aspect of this film. If more time was spent fleshing out the story, characters, with a more coherent script, then this could've been a really good film. But since so much potential was utterly wasted, I have no choice but to give my grade and it's a D."

","I have been absolutely pumped for this movie since I first saw the trailer for it last summer. I'm fresh from viewing it, and I have to say that it's not quite what I expected, though not necessarily in a bad way. To those who haven't seen it, two words: Do it. But be open to the fact that it will almost certainly not be exactly what you expect. Although it looks like a somewhat mindless kick ass, eye candy flick, don't be fooled: there is a pretty good story here, and its deeper than your first impression of it will be, also. Oh, and don't try and predict the ending.<br/><br/>After you watch it, you will need to process what actually happened, but put your thinking cap on- because its deeper than you think.<br/><br/>All in all, the acting was good enough (though it didn't blow my mind), the visuals are stellar (did blow my mind) and the soundtrack is amazing (where is my mind?). Definitely worth seeing. 8/10"

One of very few Zack Snyder films that I appreciate despite its flaws its lovable! For those who haven't seen it yet just don't expect much!"

","The most underrated movie ever. All the negative comments are understood , but if you watched this movie and you didn't like it you should watch it again.
Probably you didn't get something.
The fantasy over fantasy thing is brilliant.
When baby doll is being abused by Blue's clients she imagines that she is dancing for them. And to bare the dancing thing she is imagines fights in unreal worlds.
And the final fantasy with the doctor is just amazing.<br/><br/>Fact : At the starting scene we see curtains opening and Baby doll is with her back on a bed. When she arrives at the asylum there is Sweet Pea in the exactly position on the stage wearing blonde hair. After it we see Sweet Pea again wearing blonde hair being lobotomised to get clients ''horny''. But I think that this is more than that. What if Sweet Pea is the same person with baby doll. Imagine.
Sweet Pea is the mind and Baby Doll is the body. Even at the end makes sense. Sweet Pea never escaped. Her mind escaped. Her body was there ( Baby Doll ) but nobody couldn't touch her because her mind was free.<br/><br/>Food for thought.<br/><br/>Also plenty of Easter eggs going on in this movie.
I've watched it 4-5 times and every time I'm discovering something new."
"t-g-1998","6","8","10","15 January 2015"," Surprisingly dark and sad movie, but also entertaining
","Saw the movie today. <br/><br/>It's super fun, I loved the visuals that Zack Snyder put into it, great fantasy sequences. Original plot, even if it is too simplistic and somehow muddled. The girls were super hot too, especially the main blonde chick, she's stunning Oscar Isaac as the villain is absolutely fantastic in the movie, amazing performance <br/><br/>I think the main problem with this movie, and why I think critics didn't like it, is that it takes itself too seriously - not in the action sequences but the 'real' scenes. It puts on too much drama and deep thoughts that could be acceptable if it wasn't a fantasy action movie with hot girls shooting around all over the place! It has some philosophical lines with some deep meanings that the movie couldn't achieve by itself, so it was very pretentious on that account. There were some things that didn't make much sense to me but... F-ck it. I wish there would be 1 or 2 more fantasy sequences. Not a fan of the soundtrack either, it stood out but in the wrong way <br/><br/>In conclusion, well made film with great visuals and nice concept that often takes itself too seriously and overly dramatic but never loses the fun <br/><br/>6/10"
"doctorpupete","5","118","219","24 March 2011"," Bring a script please!
","SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>I'm from Argentina and here this movie was premiered today, one day before the rest of world.<br/><br/>Sucker punch has great action, production and music but there's one big problem which is the same problem many many directors and producers and filmmakers in general keep doing: The script is BAD.<br/><br/>Today I learned that not even Zack Snyder can save a bad script.<br/><br/>The main character gets confined to a mental asylum for reasons that stop being important once she is inside (for the rest of the movie). There, she flashes a weird burlesque world slightly related to the real world. and there, she flashes another world which is pure fantasy. This flashy third world has the cool action that we want to see. sadly it doesn't work at all, since nothing there makes sense. She finds suddenly turned into a super powered chick who fights robots, Nazis, dragons and samurais. Who are them? nobody. Why does she fight them? No reason. What if she loses the fight? We don't know. Who gives a damn then about them? Well, not me. Of course, after we start to see that her actions there mean something in the real world (actually it's not the real world either) but it's already too late. We see the first fight without caring about it since it doesn't have a background at all. And that transfers to all the rest.<br/><br/>Some of the actors were good but many of them have the problem of having to act a scene that makes no sense at all and that hurts their performances really bad. The perfect example of this is the doctor that lobotomizes her, having to repeat the ""there was a creepy look in her eyes"" speech like 5 times to make the audience believe it.<br/><br/>It's sad that all those good action scenes fell flat for the lack of story. When I saw the first action scene versus the samurais (the best one by far) I thought: ""Man!! if I had this one action scene alone at the end after a great movie with good characters I'd been totally happy. No need for more action than this in a well constructed movie."" of course, I was able to think that so early cause the fatal flaw of the movie was all exposed already.<br/><br/>Aniway. Nice action and nothing else."
"gregeichelberger","1","421","834","27 March 2011"," Suckerpunched into seeing this travesty
","This film could not be more appropriately titled. I was a ""sucker"" to pay good money to see this slop, and I felt like ""punching"" writer/producer/director Zach Snyder for putting me (and many others) through it.<br/><br/>In addition to Snyder's (""Watchman,"" ""300"") ""point-the-camera-and-get-away"" direction, there's the horrid acting (a term I use more than loosely) of Emily Browning and others. Add to that the convoluted storyline and not-so-special effects, and you easily have one of the worst movies of the year.<br/><br/>What small plot this picture has features Babydoll (Browning) as a much abused stepdaughter placed in a ""Shutter Island""-type 1950s mental institution. There, she meets a group of equally terrible actresses and begins her flights of fantasy. Browning seems to have one expression, a sad-sack, dopey-eyed, head-cocked look that makes Anna Faris' thespian abilities look like Katharine Hepburn's. <br/><br/>With this group, she delves into an ""Inception""-like world of multi-layered dimensions, fighting giant killer robots, massive zeppelins, German zombies from World War I. These scenes are all one big CGI mess that - to some, I suppose - are going to appear impressive, but when all is said and done give the (intelligent) viewer one large headache.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, an oriental-like wise man (Scott Glenn, ""The Right Stuff,"" ""Hunt For Red October"") waxes philosophical about finding a map, a key, fire, a knife and other mundane items which are supposed to make this film somewhat deep. Glenn, by the way, only was considered for this role because David Carradine had passed away.<br/><br/>To waste any more words on this slick piece of garbage would only serve to justify Snyder's pathetic vision of titillating teenage males by enticing them them with nearly bare-breasted, violent adolescent girls with guns and martial arts skills.<br/><br/>Take my advice here; unless you're a confused young women with anger and appearance issues, or a horny 14-year old boy, avoid this movie like the bubonic plague. No matter what kind of money you save by doing so, eventually, you will thank me for it."

"scotthad","1","268","549","27 March 2011"," Do NOT watch this movie, unless you like getting sucker punched.
","I'm not sure how this movie got such rave reviews by some people, oh wait yes I can, the ONLY people who can possibly like this film are fantasy/anime/comic book junkies!<br/><br/>Where do I begin... First and foremost, the biggest upset of this movie is the plot, which flip flopped back and forth, with no real point or purpose for the most part - and not in a creative/unique way. The plot starts off in some wannabe 'Inception' idea, with a fantasy inside a fantasy. Baby Girl goes from about to get a lobotomy (odd enough as it is), to going to a story inside a story, which ends with the lobotomy ending (basically the story in between the lobotomy was never explained outside the fantasy, and couldn't have happened since the lobotomy happened from the beginning of her entering the insane asylum).<br/><br/>Now for the second level of the story: So Baby Girl and her pose are trying to escape their slavery from the burlesque/whore house, and they must obtain 4 items and a ""mystery"" in order to escape, which is all fine and good. However, in the process of obtaining these items, Baby Girl and/or her pose enter the third fantasy/story aspect of the film, which is COMPLETELY NON RELATED TO ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THE FILM, and is replaced with pretty much every popular fantasy/fiction battle scene from the last 30 years of movie history. From a generic samurai sword/battle battle, to a Nazi war scene with some mech machines, to a scene literally right out of Lord of the Rings with Orcs, a castle, and dragons, to a Unstoppable(runaway train scene)/Matrix/Terminator/Defuse a bomb scene, the plot is a mess! I was waiting for some fairies, elfs, werewolves, vampires, or unicorns to come up next, but I'm sure they are saving those for sucker punch 2!<br/><br/>Aside from the plot, there were some other major issues. The soundtrack consisted of about 3 songs (or at least the same artist since they all sounded the same), It was so predictable that there would be nothing but hard chick rock. I think the movie tried way too hard to emphasize the hardcore, tough chick act; yet they still always have to have women look like little sex dolls when they battle, with perfect makeup, tits hanging out, and short skirts. <br/><br/>The volume of the audio was WAY off, in some dialog scenes the words were barely audible, yet in the battle scenes, the sound was so loud that you couldn't even think, and after the movie my ears were ringing as if I were standing right next to the speaker at a Metallica concert. I even plugged my ears at some points to attempt to save my hearing, and I could still hear the sound perfectly. I'm sorry but blasting music does NOT make a movie better.<br/><br/>I typically enjoy fantasy/super hero movies, but this one failed on all levels for me. I feel there was almost no effort in the writing of this movie, almost as if it were an after thought. The actors all seemed second rate, the crying was clearly fake and lacked emotion. Oscar Isaac seemed like he was trying too hard to be like Joker from Batman, yet he showed no genuine emotion in the scene where he executes the two girls (that execution scene had no place in this film, it made no sense, look around the theater after this scene and you will see most people scratching their head).<br/><br/>If I could rate the CG alone, it's easily an 8 or 9 out of 10, but the terrible plot, mediocre acting, and overblown-everything ruined it for me. If you honestly enjoy this movie, you have to be lying to yourself, or foolishly attempting to defend it based solely on the fact that it has fantasy/comic book aspects."
"darknalel","9","172","345","25 March 2011"," Just as you thought, you are unprepared- a film about the awesomeness of what is Action.
","I attended the midnight showing of the film last night and here are my two cents:<br/><br/>Let's start out with the fact that I really enjoyed the movie. It was no forest gump, but looking at the Director's history, no one should be expecting that anyway. Having previously directed Dawn of the Dead, 300, and Watchmen, this one fits in pretty well in the mix. The style is more Watchmen-esque than 300, but man may there be violence, and much appreciated! Oh, and the costumes are just what the demographic ordered. Though from the previews I may have been predisposed to expect a more straightforward storyline, kicking and fighting it's way to a climactic finish (possibly a little twist thrown in there); I was happily dazed enough to enjoy myself. <br/><br/>As I write this I am still trying to piece together the understory and back goings of the film. When I initially left the theater, though stunned in a sense of sheer awe, I was quite sure that I ""got"" the whole idea: Pretty straightforward, classic Indie-esque Hollywood action film. Wrong. But as I lay in bed earlier this morning trying to gather my thoughts after waking up from a Sucker Punch of a dream, I realized that I had missed something: The morality of the film. It was deep, and the more I think about it the more I realize it. This film had more guts than I realize. It wasn't only great slo-mo, poster/wallpaper-worthy brilliance (Though that it was). It had real soul. In fact I'm toying with the idea of a second watch, sort of how you rematch the Matrix Reloaded just for that epic car chase scene; but hopefully here to also flesh out some of the ideals behind the whole thing. <br/><br/>It was an epic struggle between hot chicks and bad guys, and worth the dollar for the big screen. And to boot, the film is on its way to passing my test: ""Occupies my thoughts for the next couple days"". And therefore I give it a burn-out and beat the Mustang-driving-teenager-in-the-lane next-to-you green light. If you liked Mr. Synder's (the Director) past films, you like action, or you like girls, or you're just a man; this is a good one. Go see it some night after your boss makes you sit through a two-hour meeting on Synergy. ...Then go home and change your wife's wardrobe for her. A"
"tjdimon1092","10","34","60","12 September 2011"," Great Film, well worth the $15 i paid for it
","In my opinion the movie was a good movie. It bugs me to read reviews and have people complaining because it ""looks too much like a video game"" or ""there was no real suspense"" well thats not even the point. The girls cant be hurt when there inside baby dolls dream worlds because its all in her head, and baby doll chooses to be strong. In reality they are 5 girls locked in an asylum with no control over what they can do, but the reason for it changing to a club and baby doll making up these grand stories is because she doesn't want to feel weak or dependent, inside her mind shes strong, courageous and able to stand up for herself along with her companions.<br/><br/>Maybe im reading too much into it but its a movie about escaping reality and going to a better place, a place that you can control and that you can be or do whatever you want so maybe thats the point. The end was a bit disappointing because it left us wondering what happens to ""blue"" but again in my opinion thats part of it, its left to the audience to decide what happens. Is baby doll finally at peace in her own mind? does blue pay for what he did? how does sweet pea's life play out now? its all left to the viewer who gets to (just like in the movie) be creative and decide what happens. The movie was action packed, filled with good looking girls and leaves a good message behind. <br/><br/>""You have all the weapons you need, now fight"""

","Got the privilege of watching the Indian premiere of Sucker Punch yesterday and my excitement was through the roof (afterall, this is the guy who gave us 300 and Watchmen). What made the screening even more special was it was on IMAX screen. Yesterday was the first time I have ever been to a film premiere and I will remember this for a long time. Zack has done justice to his reputation. You will find plenty of his trademark slow-mo fight scenes and close ups. I can't talk more about the fights without revealing more, but I'm positive the first fight scene will take your breath away. What made the experience jaw dropping was the ""IMAX effect"". Try and catch this film on IMAX if you can, and I'm sure it will have leave a different impression on your mind than a conventional theatre would. It features an ensemble female cast, Emily Browning(Babydoll), Jena Malone(Rocket) and Abbie Cornish(Swea Pea) played their part well whereas Vanessa Hudgens(Blondie) and Jamie Chung(Amber) were a distraction at times. But I wasn't impressed with Oscar Isaac as Blue, maybe he tried too hard to be a memorable villain. The core of the film however is the other(fictional) world (this is where we see Zack's imagination in full flight). The visuals are amazing, set-pieces are jaw dropping and epic in every sense. In short, Sucker Punch is visually enthralling action fantasy that will blow you away. Well done Zack!"

She's literally disassociating herself from reality and creating these epic tales that correlate with what she's going through in the real world. It reminds me a bit of Chicago and how they would go to a stage setting for each song.

","Even with millions of bullets flying through the air, dozens of swords swinging & the hundreds of punches these hotties take, not one of these girls ever gets a single scratch during the battles. After the first brawl pitting the Girls Club against steam-powered Germans & ferocious shooting planes it's so painfully obvious that none of the girls will be in any real danger that the big budget special effects are just fluff & overkill. What's the point of all the bullets & bad guys if the chicks are indestructible? By the second battle it's just so irritating watching these females punch, kick, shoot, jump & slice their way through crowds of bad guys when they could have just walked & not gotten hurt.

Yeah they're dressed scandalously, but what else would they be wearing in a young girl's mind? And of course they're going to be able to fight, it's all in her mind. It was a way of escaping for Babydoll. If my mother and sister were just killed, I might be a little screwed in the head too, wouldn't you?

""Punisher 3"" would have been far better, I would have enjoyed it more, no matter how cheesy it would have been...<br/><br/>""Sucker Punch"", in my opinion is a big screw up. <br/><br/>P.S.: Thought that baby doll girls with head drama would fantasize something that wouldn't involve heavy guns, monsters, swordplay, Nazis, dragons, orcs, mechanized samurai, robots, mechs, zombies, etc... I'm almost sure I missed something... That is only a boy's sweet dream. I think that both the producer, and director, woke up all wet and hard one day, and decided to put their wet dreams into a movie.<br/><br/>I recommend this sort of action-fantasy-drama-psychological-horror-thriller flick, to twisted teenage horny boys who enjoyed ""sailor moon"" with napkins instead of popcorn..."

","***May Contain Tiny Spoilers*** <br/><br/>As a Zack Snyder, I was thrilled to see him release an original piece of work. I watched this movie opening day which I've never done before just to support him. So was my time wasted? The movie follows Babydoll, as she bands with four other girls in a plan to escape the mental asylum her evil step father sent her to. The girls have five days to see through their plan before Babydoll is lobotomized.<br/><br/>Okay, this movie is no Inception but I can see why some may think of it when watching Sucker Punch. To escape her unfortunate reality Babydoll escapes into a dream world set up like a high class brothel which she uses dance to escape into other branches/levels of reality where the girls fight fantasy creatures in search of the five items they need to escape.<br/><br/>Well this is a Zack Snyder movie, so if you will complain about anything in this movie it shouldn't be the graphics. Cgi is top form in Sucker Punch and is breathtakingly beautiful and full of detail. Other than the amazing cgi, and saturated colors, it wouldn't be a Zack Snyder movie without the epic slow-mo. I wouldn't say the movie had an abundance of unnecessary slow-mo but their were more than a few. I think the scenes were spread out well. In one particular scene towards the end, the slow mo kicks in full gear and what results is one of the most amazing special effects fight scene I have seen in awhile. All the fight scenes in general worked very well and look like effort was taken into making them. It is definitely a film highlight. One thing I really enjoyed about the movie was the soundtrack. The music choices fit perfectly with the setting and kept my head slightly nodding throughout. Some people might call these scenes too ""music video like,"" but I think they worked well. The acting wasn't too shabby with stand out performances from Jena Malone aka Rocket and Oscar Issac aka Blue Jones.<br/><br/>All in all. The movie had several twists and turns that will hit you like a ""Sucker Punch."" You won't expect some things. The movie actual has a pretty good message about stories and if you pay attention you should get it. This movie is not over complicated but a lot of people might not understand exactly whats going on. It is another good effort from Snyder but a movie that the majority probably wouldn't like which might hurt him. Overall, if your looking for an entertaining ride that makes you pay attention, and starring hot girls, this just might be your movie. If your expecting Inception or Kill Bill or whatever then this probably not you movie.<br/><br/>8/10 from me."
"zetes","2","157","324","27 March 2011"," A disaster
","A crime against the cinema. It's too bad. I honestly have enjoyed Zack Snyder's films in the past, besides that crappy owl movie he made last year. I'd classify them more as guilty pleasures than actual good movies, but I found them entertaining and neat to look at. Sucker Punch, though, combines all his worst traits and adds a script that he himself wrote (along with co-writer Steve Shibuya). His previous films were all adaptations, three of picture books and one a remake of a George A. Romero classic. He didn't have to think much himself to make those neat images. Sucker Punch demonstrates that he just doesn't have the ability to think of things himself. It's a movie that combines mental hospitals, burlesque shows, giant samurai warriors, half-mechanical zombie-Nazis, mech suits, orcs, dragons, killer robots, and atomic bombs, pretty much every cool thing one can think of.<br/><br/>And then one might guess that the problem is overkill. It isn't (well, that may be a smaller problem). The major problem is that there's not a single thing we haven't seen before here. Also, the plot is created in the worst possible way. The skeleton of it is pretty much identical to Inception. While this film had to have been conceived beforehand, so you can't blame it for ripping Nolan's film off, that's just one more strike against it. Emily Browning plays a girl who accidentally kills her sister while trying to defend her from her rampaging stepfather. She's sent to a mental hospital, where she hides behind two levels of reality. In the first level down, she's the new girl at a burlesque house/whorehouse. Snyder inserts a very video game-esque premise: she and her hooker friends (Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung) are basically sex slaves, and they must find five objects to help them escape. Now, up to this point, the film is tolerable. It's not good, but it's watchable. The girls are very attractive, and the visuals are kind of old-fashioned and nice to look at.<br/><br/>But here comes the third level: whenever the girls are about to steal the next thing they need to escape, they all descend into a fantasy world which is about the most video game-like thing to ever appear in a movie. Well, kind of. There was Scott Pilgrim vs. the World last year. That one actually used video games in a clever, metaphorical way, and it did it with its tongue in its cheek. Snyder really thinks we want to watch people play video games on the big screen. The worst thing was, after I experienced the abject horrors of how boring this could possibly be the first time, I realized I was going to have to sit through this same thing four more times. Oh, these sequences are beyond awful, with these girls fighting through dozens of not-very-great-looking CGI Nazis, robots, orcs, whatever. This is the worst parts of every event movie of the past decade mashed into never-ending sequences. There's nothing logical about the existence of these sequences. The funny thing is, in that second level of reality, while these fantasy sequences are going on, Browning is dancing sexily in front of whomever the girls want to distract. I think Snyder had to have known that the premise that this girl is such a sexy dancer that anyone watching her would be so utterly distracted that the other girls could steal from them was laughably ridiculous. But, watching the movie, I'm not so sure he was smart enough to realize this. He's also not smart enough to realize that the audience this film was intended for would probably rather be watching the girl dance sexily than watch these hot girls play video games in front of us.<br/><br/>While these video game sequences are some of the worst cinema I've ever experienced, and about the worst bit of narrative, as well, Snyder isn't done completely screwing up. He completely miscalculates which characters the audience gives a damn about. He also doesn't make any sense of the connection between the first and second levels of reality (we'll thankfully forget about the third), and characters whom we met in the second level but not in the first aren't able to connect to the audience when we meet them there. The film ends with a character whom we don't know and don't give a crap about. And then I stand up and flee the theater, and it's all I can do not to start a riot in the lobby."
"drakula2005","10","90","179","10 April 2011"," Zack Snyder's cruelty once again finds it's audience
","Listening to Emily Browning's adaptation of Eurythmics's Sweet Dreams, i must say i found some decisions in the movie-making process very bizarre, decisions made mainly by Zack Snyder, coming right out of the blue.<br/><br/>For example, he wrote the script directly as a PG-13 movie, something very untypical for him.In an interview, he stated, that the movie was already to cruel and the story itself was too hard on viewers for him to make it an R-rated movie.So he did it directly for PG-13.When does that ever stopped him to do it.In Watchmen, there were some pretty intense and gross, so to say, scenes, that it was hard to bear.And in Sucker Punch, the opening scene was intense, full of emotions, so was the ending as well, but that's not a reason for Zack no to do what he's best at.So that was a sucker punch for the audience, and as well a reason for the movie not to fit in to the frame of most Zack Snyder movies.Even his remake of Romero's Dawn of the Dead was performing better at the domestic box office in it's start, not to mention Watchmen and 300.<br/><br/>Besides that, there are some plot holes to be seen here or there, acting to be improved and some other details, that need to be touched to be perfect.<br/><br/>So saying all that, i shall explain why i'll rather give the movie the full note than apply those weaknesses to the note.Zack Snyder has those skills, i personally think no other director has.He has the ability to speak to the audience with his style with what we see on screen, combined with the powerful soundtracks and songs he and Tyler Bates, the composer, use.He lets his visually rich and upgraded style speak for himself, and that's very unique for him and for the movies he make.There literary is no dialogue in the first few minutes of the movie, he allows the viewer to see and be a part of the experience, of those frames.The feeling in the viewer is stronger when it's all shown, rather than spoken of.Actions are stronger than words.And Zack Snyder knows that.With him words are not necessary for the strenght of a movie.And that he makes perfect good use of.That's what's impressive with his work, and that's why i'll give the full note to the movie, as i did to 300 and Watchmen despite some flaws and holes.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the CGI was great, the movie as a whole is a visual masterpiece and people will see that a lot of effort and commitment is sacrificed for the quality, the movie has.The crystal clear shots, made a little 60s like, are great and the fight sequences and than the train and castle sequences in the imaginary world, that Babydoll's in are great.So there can't be any complaints about that.<br/><br/>The acting was something that could've been up a little bit.Emily Browning is very lovable and convincing in her role as Babydoll, a young girl, who experienced the death of her mother and sister, and her stepfather, involved in it.He institutionalizes her and she reprises this part of her role almost perfect.She has the needed experience from her last movie, The Uninvited, where the role is very similar to this one, at least most of it.Shid did a perfect job with the other part of her role as well, being a somewhat silent but very skillful and good looking deadly warrior, killing everything in her way to survive in the imaginary world she creates, in the brothel and in the mental institution she's at.Abbie Cornish was also solid in her role as one of the girls in the facility.Vera Gorski and Blue Jones, played by Carla Gugino and Oscar Isaac were good as well, although his role is very unpleasant so to say.<br/><br/>So the acting was good and it's obvious, that the cast had a great time together.That's mainly because of another great choice Zack Snyder and Tyler Bates've made.They let Emily Browning, who, aside from her acting skills, is obviously a talented singer as well, perform some of the songs, for example Sweet Dreams and Asleep, both of witch were reprised and remade perfectly for the film.The voices of the other actresses can be heard in the background of the songs.So that made a great bond between the actors and what helped to improve the movie.<br/><br/>So with some great decisions from the team and some great performances from the cast (mainly Emily Browning pulling the movie forward), the movie ended up as a very entertaining movie-going experience, sad and intense at moments, breathtaking and cool in others.All in all, it could've been better but i liked it like that as well and in order to get some things straight, i'm ready to see it once more.<br/><br/>I liked it, one of the first movies a really liked this year, and although this wasn't Zack Snyder's best effort financially, the movie definitely has it's fans, and so it marks the true beginning of the movie season.<br/><br/>Not Zack Snyder's best, but i'll give it the full note anyway.Bring on Superman:Man of Steel!<br/><br/>10/10 <br/><br/>P.S.There are tributes to some classics in the movie, classics such as LOTR, i'm sure you'll notice them :)"
"jim-farley","10","18","30","11 November 2011"," Looked like a blast... ended up being a whole lot more. (spoilers at bottom)
","First off, I'll say I would have given this movie an 8 except, having seen it 4 times now, I keep seeing new stuff every time. It remains a not-quite-solved riddle. I don't mean I'm seeing props or action I had missed before; I mean I'm seeing more and more what the writer's really getting at. What's even better is the mind-""frying"" never lets up. I still don't know whether to feel happy or sad about the ending! To me, that's a sign of a film's greatness.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of mind""fry"" movies, I'll admit. But this one is special. It's like a huge, drawn-out sleight-of-hand trick. You will almost certainly be looking in the wrong direction for most of the film the first time through, but it was meant to be experienced that way. This ain't no action flick with hot chicks blowing stuff up, but it plays one on TV.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, I'm still not entirely sure of the ending. Way too much symbolism to take it at face value! One thing I will encourage you to do is: watch the extended version, if you have the chance. It fills in a few bothersome gaps, and has a really fun musical number added.<br/><br/>I knew this was going to be a film I would love forever from the moment I heard the opening note of ""Army of Me"" during Baby Doll's first dance. If you enjoy mind""fry"" movies, or drama, or action films, or comic book adaptations, put Sucker Punch on your short list. Oh, and one more thing: keep your eyes open!<br/><br/>*EDIT* *SPOILER ALERT* I read some of the other reviews of this film, and decided I should go ahead and add some spoilers, because without them, you might not know WHY you need to see this.<br/><br/>I'm a student of psychology and human behavior. What's going on here, is that Sweet Pea is telling her story, but the story starts with something happening to her ""Angel"". I am not sure, but I think Baby Doll and Rocket (as well as Amber and Blondie) are repressed aspects of Sweet Pea's personality. I think Sweet Pea is Schizophrenic in a big way. Probably due to trauma. None of the girls have names that make any sense. You expect a girl named Rocket to be hot stuff, right? She's not so much. You expect a girl named Amber to be anything but East Asian. You expect Sweet Pea to be sweet, but she's not! She's mean and fearful. Blondie's not a blonde, and Baby Doll is the only one with a name that makes sense, but only as an OBJECT. That's why I'm thinking that Baby Doll is the persona used to interact with the outside world. The clue is in the ending of the extended version. After the lobotomy, Sweet Pea gets on the bus (with a character from the fantasy world) and rides past a sign that says ""Paradise Diner"" (there are a lot of uses of the word ""paradise"" in here). Also, one of the movie posters says ""My dream is yours"" and several say ""Gold diggers"". Sweet Pea, as they say, is gone, baby!"
"js-61937","9","20","34","9 January 2016"," High Rating as a Cult Classic
","I will try to avoid spoilers and simply give some depth to reviews I have read so far. But I will check the spoiler box just in case.<br/><br/>This film is about a Sucker Punch. That is a victim who does not invite the event, and is unaware of it. The lights go out on an unsuspecting or innocent person.<br/><br/>A innocent person's lights went out in the film. But as a pure Sucker Punch victim, her identity is on ice until her lights eventually go out for good.<br/><br/>She fantasized innocently, but with a nice ferocity, to deal with being drugged and abused. The ferocity inspired her friends to improve their situation in some ways.<br/><br/>The character development is in the innocent ferocious fantasies, and that is enough for this film.<br/><br/>I liked the first fight the best, but they were all quite good, and fierce, which is what they needed to be. Ferocity is not a male preserve, and the film captured it well.<br/><br/>This could easily be a cult classic, if better understood. Filmmakers make films with more depth than they realize, by keeping it simple, which is exactly what this film did.<br/><br/>I hope it pays off for the production team in the long run."
"Quicksand","3","130","272","25 March 2011"," What If You Spent $50 Million on a CGI Man Taking a Dump?
","It's kind of difficult to comment on the movie, without just writing, ""Terrible,"" and clicking the submit button. To write a good comment, one must write WHY it is terrible... but where to begin? If someone came into your home, and defecated in the middle of your living room, would you need to explain in a calm manner, three reasons why the person was wrong for doing such a deed? No. You'd toss them by their ear out onto the street, left with the unenviable task of having to clean up. Perhaps you'd even call the police.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, you spent $50 million (or whatever the budget was; it was too high, in any event) to have someone take a CGI dump in your living room... is that any better? There are three actors in this movie: Scott Glenn, Jena Malone, and Carla Gugino. Four, if you count Jon Hamm, but he's not in the movie long enough to matter. There are these three, and everything else is there to talk until it's time for another special effect. Jena Malone isn't even required to do any of these things, but because she has actual experience as an actress, bothered to create a character and reflect an emotional state during the 'story.' Everyone else just showed up, put on the costumes, and talked until the director said 'cut.' Vanessa Hudgens should have been a clue.<br/><br/>Even if the story is awful, unmemorable, or predictable (Suckerpunch is all three), other Hollywood movies may rely on memorable action sequences or visuals. In a movie roughly 100 minutes long, these action sequences take up roughly five minutes of screen time. Then Snyder detonates an explosive in New York. Again.<br/><br/>It's not so much that Zack Snyder hates audiences, it's just that he's incredibly naive, like a 12-year-old suddenly given the keys to his dads liquor cabinet. He wants you to like a character, he makes them female and puts them in a low-cut top. He wants you to hate a character, he makes that character a rapist or molester of children. He does this again and again; these appear in every movie he's ever made, save for his first (and best) film, ""Dawn of the Dead,"" which was written by someone else entirely. Someone who understands subtlety and character development. Realize, too, that I'm saying this about a movie where a smarmy rich dude accidentally chainsaws his most recent sexual partner.<br/><br/>Whatever fancy visuals made it to the trailer, the movie is this: Zack Snyder wrote a script with his camera-man, and it is neither funny nor exciting. It's a 100-minute demo reel, and considering this is his fifth movie, he really should have actually created something with weight, by this point.<br/><br/>I'm not going to call the police, but I am going to be mad for a week, because even though I've cleaned my floor, the smell lingers on. 3/10."

","OK i've watched it twice, and I've come away with a story that is very satisfying. I highly rate this film after seeing it for what it is. Here's how i understand it:<br/><br/>All the characters from the brothel are real. The brothel is Sweet Pea's mind's interpretation of what is happening in the real world. She creates this dream world as a means to escape from the horrors of the real world where the girls are being abused. She also created it because the doctor was teaching her how to use her imagination as part of her therapy.<br/><br/>Baby Doll was also very real, and also had the dream therapy from the doctor. Her mind created the world where all the fighting scenes occurred.<br/><br/>So each of the 2 alternate universes are actually re-expressions of what is actually occurring in the real world from 2 different points of view (Sweet Pea sees dancing, Baby Doll sees swords and guns)<br/><br/>Therefore, Sweet Pea does actually escape, and Baby Doll is lobotomized although she completely accepts it and welcomes it at that point as a means to remove the guilt of killing her sister.<br/><br/>Baby Doll and the Old Guy are the guardian angels Sweet Pea was talking about at the start of the movie.<br/><br/>Now what I speculate is: 1. The girls dancing is a metaphor for the girls having sex or being raped/abused. 2. When baby doll is dancing she is seducing the target while someone else steals the item.<br/><br/>Great Film!"

You know when you go to a movie and you can tell within the first few seconds whether or not it's going to be a good movie? Well, I got that feeling that it wasn't going to be any good and to my suspected notion, it wasn't. <br/><br/>I was hopeful to see some hot chicks kicking butt, but that just did not happen. There is nothing worse than seeing hot chicks that cannot fight to save their a$$, moving in slow motion to disguise that fact, and then see them whip everyone in sight just because that is supposed to be what happens in the script and that is EXACTLY what happened. Over and over again. <br/><br/>They could have taken a good lesson from Hit-Girl in Kick-Ass. Now that girl could fight and I could watch her fight all night long, because it was cool, interesting, and she could act. <br/><br/>The acting in this movie was horrible. With the exception of Scott Glenn's scene in the end I felt nothing for any of the characters and it was like watching bad auditions.<br/><br/>The scenes/characters were very reminiscent of other films like Lord of the Rings, Hellboy, Batman, etc. For the most part I was just waiting for it to be over so that I could leave.<br/><br/>I really thought that they could have done so much more than they did."
"harshad-d","7","11","17","27 March 2011"," Not a movie everyone would like
","There are movies which everyone loves, and then some which everyone hates. Sucker Punch cannot fall into either category-- its more like a film made by a geek for the geeks among us. From what you see in the opening sequence - the lead character being lead to the asylum - you get the feeling that this movie is done by a director who wanted to put in what he himself loved into the movie. The dark clouds, a very brooding arch with the name of the asylum on it, the stylized automobile...everything gives the scene a typical flavor. And you either get immediately attracted to it or you just get put off. Me, I was pulled magnetically! <br/><br/>The movie has everything a geek loves - there's Steampunk, there's Fantasy and there's Sci-Fi. Running through all this are the lead girls-with-big- guns-and-swords and the amazing fight sequences. Its a totally fun movie. But if you go in for the movie looking for a reason or method to the mayhem, then you will come out feeling confused, disappointed and duped. Its a movie to be enjoyed just for the way it IS. No hidden meanings to be expected, nothing to be deduced. Everything is served the way it is, and you have to enjoy it in that spirit. Don't treat the movie like Wine--looking for all the hidden flavors and subtleties - but treat it like a shot of Vodka - just take it for what it is, shut up and feel the kick! And one solid kick it is, with the lovely girls, skimpy skirts, big explosions, massive fight sequences and amazing CGI. <br/><br/>I went along with a non-geek friend and he didn't get it. But he found it entertaining. So before you go for the movie, think of what you are looking for."

","Okay, the first time I saw this movie was the short version. (1.5 hours or so) and thought it was an okay movie. Plot holes here and there, a bit difficult to follow, not amazing graphics and no way at all to understand what the doctor meant when he talks of 'the look in her eyes' etc. I just finished the full extended version (Just over 2 hours) and I was amazed and pleased at how different they are. <br/><br/>The short version lacked the full story of what happened to Babydoll that caused her to be committed, it missed out on most of the fighting, to see her grow stronger and braver every time she 'went away' and the sacrifice she made to save another. <br/><br/>The ending blew my mind, with the short version you can't really place the 3 stages. The reality, her reality after the lobotomy then the fantasy inside her personal reality. Only the full extended version can you really go okay, that guy is reality, a doctor who simply wants to help, that guy is her reality and he's evil, wants to control and selfish, and that is not reality in any sense (Her fantasies are extremely easy to pick out however).<br/><br/>To put it simply, watch the extended version or you will be disappointed. It has a fair amount of adultery, violence etc, so not suitable for kids but its well worth watching. The graphics are amazing, the storyline wonderful and the actors superb."

Sweet pea and baby doll are the same person and the fantasy situations they use In order to escape are due to the therapy dr dorksi implements allowing them to ""control their own worlds"".

I'm expected to believe a woman in any reality would dream of being a prostitute/erotic dancer. This isn't Showgirls. <br/><br/>This film was insulting to me as woman. It's a man's fantasy about what woman really want. We all don't want to be prostitutes. We don't all wish we could wear outfits that show too much cleavage and our butt-cheeks. <br/><br/>It's insulting that in Baby Doll's fantasy from the mental institution.... the only way a group of woman can distract or get the best of their captors was dance erotically. That is an awful message. And the action-fantasy sequences that are the escape from the first fantasy... are weak. I felt like every time the so-called wise man showed up it was Bosley telling the Angels what their mission was. There was no context. Why were their Nazis? Why was their a dragon? Why did Jon Hamm get top billing for a movie he was barely in? <br/><br/>Also it lacked any and all plot points. The dialogue wasn't believable and every world rang false.

I can sum up everything good about this movie in two points:<br/><br/>1. It had stunning visuals (though ill-used motifs). 2. It had the best original soundtrack of any movie I've seen (better than even Aronofsky's The Fountain).<br/><br/>The movie's opening was almost great being very reminiscent of the movie Up's opening that I could watch enough times to constitute the entire movie's screen time. However, the opening to Suckerpunch was squandered by a bad voice over and unnecessary dialogue that broke the mood very soon into the film. Throughout the rest of the movie, this becomes a recurring theme incarnate in useless screen time and an equally ruined ending to movie (a movie that should have ended two minutes and forty seconds earlier, but another bad voice over and pointless dialogue detracted from what would have been a lasting impression on the audience and me.<br/><br/>Now that we have cleared away the beginning and the end of the movie, we can look at all that's in between. The main character was very well written:<br/><br/>1. She was portrayed as a blank slate, but rather than having the other characters and her environment reflect onto her, she paints her own canvas as the movie goes on allowing the audience to grow with the character and share empathy. 2. She doesn't ruin the mood with poor dialogue too often.<br/><br/>On the other hand, she had many flaws that could have been left out to create a more enjoyable experience:<br/><br/>1. Her entire purpose in the movie seemed very much visual and much less mental in that much of her screen time was spent running and gunning against an endless stream of enemies. 2. Rather than contributing to the scenarios she is placed in, she goes with the flow and merges in with the other characters she is paired with giving her no room to stand out. 3. She is never alone enough for the audience to really grow into her without having to push another character out of the way.<br/><br/>Considering she's the protagonist, it's a bit unnerving to see her character have more flaws than strengths. I really did find myself rooting less for her, and more for the group she was in. The characters she attempts to escape with don't really become part of her, but rather conform to her contributing nothing, detracting from nothing, and being overall just filler.<br/><br/>The dreams in the movie themselves are poorly used and come across as merely an excuse to flash more military hardware in your face. This is where the movie becomes very much like the worst first person shooter released this year: Call of Duty: Black Ops. Much screen time is pointless firefights between Warhammer 40K factions and scantily clad teenagers wielding L/SMG's that does not advance the plot or develop the characters any, rather, all the people in this movie are two-dimensional without personality that drew no emotion from me with their deaths. Ask yourself, ""Why do the characters in the movie cry when their friends die and I don't shed a tear?"" The answer is clear: Those characters knew more about each other than we did, they were under greater stress than we were, they had greater ambitions than any of us in that theater, and they felt more emotions than we could looking at the screen in front of us. All of this is because the movie does not do a good job of replicating the character's emotions, we do not connect to the people in the film, and we know very little about almost all of them.<br/><br/>Plot and character wise, there is really nothing good about this movie at all. I suggest you watch a slideshow of some of the more stunning screenshots with the amazing soundtrack played over it, then you will get the optimum experience this movie has to offer, because that's all it is: a pretty picture and good music. My final statement: I watched it so you don't have to."

You just have to let yourself go in it and enjoy. Well, half naked and attractive girls kicking ass, dance, strip; fantastic music, flawlessly directed fight scenes, drama, sadness, true nature of man who is just evil and one good girl is giving all to beat it. With every viewing you get something new, cause it's hard to understand it fully.

","A lot can be said about this film, but only when accompanied by clenched fists and a look of bewilderment. Wooden acting, one-dimensional characters, awful writing, boring and repetitive action sequences, a plot which is predictable in it's journey to no-where, a lack of meta-story, a horrible degradation of well-loved songs, evidently bad editing (which is a rare one)... All contributing to a pile of misogynist filth that makes you wonder why you still bother going to the cinema. This film characterizes everything that is wrong with modern cinema, emphasizing looks above content and a type of 'stylised' filmmaking which is long past its sell by date above common sense. Don't see this film, unless you enjoy developing an aversion of movies."
"savagehavok","1","80","169","27 March 2011"," This movie is horrible
","Sucker Punch was horrible. I usually like to find the good in movies however this seems impossible. The main character is sent to an insane asylum and is threatened to be lobotomized. The story progression was just all over the place. I mean the protagonist was ""trying to find an escape (freedom)"". What do you mean she should of just had the lobotomy. After seeing this movie I felt like I had just received one and that I was searching for freedom; from the movie theater. I tried to walk out however my ride insisted we watch the movie in its entirety. The sound track was nothing but remakes of older songs that already had remakes to them and all put into depressing atmosphere. The movie has scenes that go into slow-mo when it doesn't even call for it. The entire opening is slow for ten minutes. Also the girls aren't even hot. With the exception for a few, they are pasty, no curved girls that should only be rated as 6s at best. Now I know what most people would say ""well the action scenes were good"" No. They weren't. with the exception of the scene where she fights the samurai nothing really wowed me and I was bored with each fight scene. Scott Glen says nothing important and almost anything inspiring that comes out of his mouth is that of a cheesy quote that I'd expect to see on my google homepage. With each ""mission"" being as ridiculous as possible to retrieve the most random assortment of items, the guy could have told her to pick up his dry cleaning: ""you'll need a ticket; change; and a receipt"". The movie would have been more realistic if the girls had a more tangible goal like revenge. At the end of the movie they couldn't think of a creative ending for the characters so they kill all the girls and the girl who was a negative Nancy the entire film lives. Good job Zack Snyder you failed at making an interesting movie and congratulations on the raspberry award for worst movie of the year."
"basilios_mulder","3","56","115","27 March 2011"," Visual effects overkill!
","There is only one word to describe this movie, which is: overkill! The movie is like a long visual effects stravaganza, but it almost seems like someone forgot they where trying to tell a story.<br/><br/>Lets begin at the beginning. First of all, the opening scene is actually quite good. The almost non-spoken scene says more then enough, and the visual style sets the tone for the rest of the movie, which is fine. But once the movie gets started, things start to be unclear. The switch from fantasy to reality and back are unclear, and the it's almost as if Snyder forgot what story he was telling, and only focused on the visuals of the movie.<br/><br/>Now, the visual effects are stunning, as is the whole visual style of the movie. If only we would care about our main characters, and would understand the movie, things would've been much better. At one point in the movie, I actually felt in one point of the movie, I wanted to know how things ended in reality, in stead of the fantasy world, which I think is not the intend of the filmmaker. The whole purpose of the fantasy world, is to keep you at the edge of your seat, thrilled and amazed. But instead, I was only annoyed when they cut to this world, since this real world, was much more interesting then those fantasy pieces, which seemed to have no goal at all then just entertain the audience.<br/><br/>It is obvious the goal was to entertain with the huge spectacular visual effects, but to me it shows something different. Apparently the filmmaker was so scared his story would not be interesting enough, and therefore added in this whole fantasy world, to keep things entertaining. Too bad, because I would've rather seen the real side world, which I thought could've given a much more interesting world.<br/><br/>In my idea, this is a typical example of a director using visual effects, which he doesn't understand. He doesn't use them to tell the story, he uses them because he can.<br/><br/>Poor movie, poor script, wonderful art direction and visuals though. A clear case of a good team, but no good leader. Sorry Snyder."
"ulncnd","1","70","149","29 March 2011"," Did anyone not see the same movie?
","This movie was terrible in my opinion. I don't know how this movie has a 6 out of 10 rating on IMDb. Reasons why this movie was terrible:<br/><br/>Acting: the main character (Babydoll) was pretty bad. She had the same look on her face for 90% of the film and delivered her lines badly. The two girls that played the sisters (Rocket and Sweet Pea) were really good and so was the guy who played the villain (Blue). Everyone else was just bad. <br/><br/>Action: I usually am not bothered by over-the-top too much but the fight scenes didn't make any sense. For example, in the second scene, the girls take on a horde of steam-powered, Nazi zombies (omg) and, despite the fact that all the Nazis had guns, they all charged them and tried to hit them with their guns or bayonets. And died of course. None of the action scenes made sense. <br/><br/>(Spoilers Warning: If you haven't seen the movie, don't read my explanation about the plot)<br/><br/>Plot: Dumb. If you don't know what's happening, let me explain. Babydoll and her sister live with their mother and evil step-dad. When mom dies (poison?) evil step-dad reveals he is only there for the money in the Will. For some reason, he never bothered to read it before he started poisoning mom and now discovers all the money goes to the girls. In a stupid scene, Babydoll accidentally kills her sister (for which she mostly shows no remorse throughout the film) and gets committed. Now she starts to fantasize. Sometimes she's in an institution. Sometimes she is in a whorehouse where she has to dance for customers and the pimp. (here's where it gets really bad) Whenever she dances, she gets transported away in her mind to these action scenes where she fights various creatures and when she comes back to reality, everyone is like ""that was the hottest dance ever!"" (but you never get to see it). Then she comes up with the brilliant escape plan to dance for people, and while they are mesmerized by her moves, the other girls will steal things they need to escape (lighters, maps, keys etc). I wont bore you with the rest of the plot, but it doesn't get any better. <br/><br/>Music: Too much, too often. The songs usually play over the whole action scene and are not that good and last 3 or 4 minutes each time.<br/><br/>CGI: not that good. I really was kind of let down by how mediocre a lot of it looked. <br/><br/>Costumes: the costuming for the non-CGI monsters was pretty bad. Then there was a scene with knights vs goblins and you could tell they were all old masks from Lord of the Rings. And I don't mean copies. They were the exact same goblins and orcs from LOTR. Exactly. And as much as I like girls in short shorts, they wore them all the time and after an hour you're like ""do they have jeans?"". It starts to not make sense. <br/><br/>Dialogue: overall, it was incredibly poorly written. There were scenes where the people were talking and you have to ask yourself why this conversation sounds like anything but babble and then, at the end of that conversation, someone says ""This could work"" referring to the dumbest plans in history. <br/><br/>I hate this movie. I really do. I hope to never see it again and I am glad it didn't make the #1 spot this weekend. I felt robbed."

","This movie gives me ambivalent feelings. It has excellent technical aspects, as one would expect from Zack Snyder, but i rather more enjoyed the LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS than this one, which although was an animated one about owls, had more story and worthy visual effects than this one. Mistake me not - the FX in this movie are super cool,and the eye-candy kicking their way through the plot are well worth it. But it is the plot that i cannot grasp. The director has definitely succeeded in blurring the lines between reality and fantasy, and you do get to understand the way things go even though it appears to be fantasy, which is the basis of this film ( as per tag line and storyline, a girl dreams of other things to plot of escape in a very glum asylum) However, after sitting for nearly 2 hours with this one, i can't keep wondering...what's the point of this film??"
"audreydangerously","1","28","54","23 June 2011"," I wanted a lobotomy after seeing this
","Sucker Punch is yet another plot less, stretched out music video posing as a film for 'kids.' How this managed to garner a PG13 rating disturbs me. All this film manages to achieve is showing young women that you can 'handle' the most gruelling sexual and physical tortures by zoning out and regressing to your 'happy place' while they're happening- and in your happy place, you will still remain a sexualised caricature of yourself.<br/><br/>*Clichéd imagery of mental institutions. Seriously, do we really need to see the pastiche of yet another too dark to make anything out, run down asylum where all the orderlies are bad men who want to fondle the inmates and all the women are uncaring evil crones? It's like the Snyder got given a handbook for Most Successful Scary Settings For Films for his 13th birthday, read the first page and got cracking on his 'inspiration board.'<br/><br/>* All of the male roles are sexually and physically violent, manipulative, capitalistic, greedy and opportunistic- there is not one redeeming male role who could give a counter argument to this disturbing portrait. Oh except for the man who exists in 'Baby Doll's' dream state- the only older character, who flips from faux Japanese Zen master to Army Drill Sergeant in different 'dreams', but who maintains consistently the role of sage adviser (even as a hokey bus driver in the end). This character is castrated from the above mentioned 'typically male' characteristics by his age bracket- through being older he has been rendered symbolically impotent and therefore he ceases to be sexually or physically threatening to the young women and can go about doling out his fantastic wisdom as he fancies- to which of course, the ecstatic girls listen and obey attentively. Why would a girl who had been attempted raped and abused by multiple men choose a male apparition in her dream state to be her spiritual adviser? That is not only not believable, but also highly insulting. Did the male writer's even consider this? Here's one of his witticisms:<br/><br/>'Don't ever write a check with your mouth you can't cash with your ass.'<br/><br/>Interesting advice to a band of girls' trying to escape sexual exploitation.<br/><br/>* The disturbingly young appearance of the female lead is horrifying. The writers clumsily make a point of mentioning the character of 'Baby Doll' is 20 (on her asylum admittance forms), because if they hadn't, you could swear she wasn't a day over 12. She barely speaks throughout the entirety of the film, and her overly puffy lips and stupid doe eyes reduce her 'acting' to that of an animated Bratz doll.<br/><br/>For a very good portion of the film this character does not utter a single word, even while watching her step father rape her younger sister, or watching an ally being shot point blank in the head, or stabbed in the chest (yes, that's right folks, if you're into watching young girls in corsets and fish nets being murdered then this film is for you!)- where are her screams for help? Why is this 'heroine' silent? The girls never use their voices, their intelligence to get themselves out of trouble- the writers' allow them two tools- exploiting themselves as sexual objects, and weapons- lots and lots of weapons. Here is a news flash to writers out there: IF YOUR CHARACTERS HAVE TO RELY ON A TRUCKLOAD OF MAGICALLY NEVER ENDING WEAPONS, THEY ARE NOT STRONG. <br/><br/>*We have, steam punk zombie Nazis , warlocks and some further faceless, medieval soldiers in one dream sequence involving a dragon.<br/><br/>The girls NEVER defeat anyone human. Even in her fantasy Baby Doll is not strong enough to defeat a man. The fight scene participants have to be reduced to mutant or re-animated men to be defeated. No 'men' we're killed in this film. Not one.<br/><br/>* The costumes are repulsive. The majority of the time the girls appear in corsets and fishnets, and I'm not even going to bother going into why this is a problem, because if you can't figure it out for yourself then I'm guessing you probably really enjoyed this film and got a bit moist in the nether regions over it.<br/><br/>* The only female role holding a position of authority is a strip instructor who aids the men by training the girls to be sex slaves. She never displays intelligence, and is similarly over-sexed and powerless as the girls. <br/><br/>* In the end the female lead is lobotomised anyway. This makes the message of the film confusing and insulting. Actually, just confusing. What was the point of all this?<br/><br/>* The music is absolute dirge<br/><br/>* There is one token black guy, who plays an orderly at the very end. This film is overall, very 'white' and the only two indistinctly ethnic looking characters are shot point blank, while the white girls get to live.<br/><br/>I hope this film stops at least one unsuspecting girl seeing this disgusting film. I wish I never had- just more men with big money and even bigger egos craftily finding ways to put you down, while appearing like they're empowering you- while you get more confused and powerless, and they get more certain and powerful. Girls, in your dreams you aren't a stripper. End. of. discussion."

","The title is very close to what the movie really is. They lure you with girls, then surprise attack you with one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life. First off, there are some of the most annoying screen filters I've ever dealt with. The whole movie too! Second off, it has some of the worst acting and dialog I've ever seen/heard in my entire life. Vanessa Hugens is about to get eaten by a dragon and shes acting like its not a big deal at all. Also, the narrator is babbling on about angels and how they follow you or something stupid. Third, there are SO MANY overused clichés. The slow-mo fighting, slutty girls as action hero. and the list goes on. fourth, they stole from 4 different movies. The German general from Baby Doll's second vision looks like Freddie Kruger (Nightmare on elms st.) His men look like terminators (Terminator), In Baby Doll's 3rd vision, the robots that they're fighting look like the service robots from i,Robot. and The ending is almost the exact same ending as Shutter Island, like the fact that nothing was really what it seemed. It happened but it wasn't in a whore-house, it was in an insane house. Fifth, The Lame action. Like I mentioned before, extremely cliché. Not to mention that it was extremely overdone and dull. Nothing stood out tome. It was all stuff I've seen in other movies. What really annoyed me was that all the girls were in perfect condition during and after the fighting. no scratches, no messy hair/make up. They were untouched. Sixth, extremely predictable. I predicted a good portion of what would've happen. I.e. The scene with the baby dragon, the fact that only 1 girl made it out, and the whole ending. Seventh, dull character development. All the girls where the same and not that good looking. No character stood out. they all had the same back ground and made this film worse than it was. Eight, underdeveloped plot line. the plot line is very bland. These girls are attempting to escape an asylum which was disguised to be a whore house with a very unorganized plan. This cheap plot line was covered up with girls in revealing clothes and action we've seen over and over again. And finally, half of the movie is computer generated. In all of Baby Doll's visions, there are very few real actors. most of it is CGIed monsters and robots. They probably did that to get the action-lover's attention. Those are the 9 main things that made this movie as bad as it is. I wondered why they tried so hard for the PG13 rating. Then I realized when I walked in and saw crowds of teenage boys. They tried to make money off of the kids because they're suckers for girls with revealing clothes. They don't care for plot line or character development. If there's violence, blood and girls, teenage boys will line up to see it. And that is why this movie failed."

What woman would EVER, when finding a place in her mind away from the horrors of reality, choose to imagine herself as a whore?! The only way to accomplish your goals and be free is to dance erotically for your captors? Really?! What a great message to send to young girls.<br/><br/>The writers really didn't spend any time on character development. They kill off almost everyone and you really don't care. It's like a move made from an elementary school students fantastical imagination, anime and the stolen idea of Inception. The dialog was lifeless and uninteresting. The only reprieves from the dark depressing atmosphere were some good CG fantasy action scenes that in themselves had nothing to do with anything. The movie really drug on and on and on and on and on.... really very boring. What a waste of money."

","This movie was so pointless that I wondered why I was even sitting in the theater watching it half way through the movie and why I sat through the whole thing at the end of the movie. Maybe it was because I paid $15.00 to see it on an IMAX screen or the fact that I was so sickened by the movie and needed time to gather myself to leave.<br/><br/>The movie was so incoherent and the majority of the movie had so little to do with the start and ending of the movie that if you left the theater and walked back in at different parts of the movie you would think it was an entirely different movie each time just casting the same actors and actresses. Definitely not worth the time and money of movie goers and may not even be worth watching it if it was to one day be shown on HBO or Starz one day.<br/><br/>If you are the type of movie watcher who has a short span of attention then the movie will definitely seem great. If you however watch movies expecting that the scenes and the story of a movie should all tie in together then this is not your type of movie. The movie does a poor job at explaining what really happened to the characters in the movie and what exists only in the mind of cool effects and lots of explosions. The audience never gets a chance to learn anything about the characters' character because the movie never builds up any of the characters fully.<br/><br/>If you've yet to waste your money on this movie then use that money to go buy yourself some dinner.

The sheer imagery defies words. The execution of imagination is brilliant.<br/><br/>Like it was said in many reviews, there isn't a strong script and this is one of those movies which does not need it. The music, the dark visual style, the steampunk action sequences will either make you groan or make you sit up and dig deeper and deeper into your popcorn bucket.<br/><br/>Every last pixel is well imagined and the visual tapestry that is a result of Snyder's imagination and astounding vfx will blow everything off into the background.<br/><br/>Imagine the best fight sequences of LOTR mated with the slo-mo of matrix and the mood of 300 you will have a very slight idea of what this is all about. Go watch the movie with this expectation and it will still blow your mind.<br/><br/>Okay, my conscience wants me to say something more, but feel free not to read this - makes no difference.<br/><br/>Emily Browning's deadpan expressions are a slight drawback, but then with Cornish, Hudgens, Zepplins, Monsters, Katanas and the rest on screen, you barely get to notice Browning's shortcomings."

I actually think that the ones who have rated this as low just don't understand the film or won't accept it for what it is.<br/><br/>I think Sucker Punch is a pretty cool idea with its layered stories, i.e. the reality and the fantasies within it. We only get to see the reality at the start and end of the film whilst the fantasies that are played out tell us what happens in between. It isn't that confusing really and obviously given that this is all about what goes on in a persons imagination then there doesn't have to be any rules. That's why in the deepest fantasy when the girls are attempting to acquire the four items there are dragons and clockwork Nazis's in there. <br/><br/>All in all it is what it is; a sci-fi, CGI, fantasy film with tons of action (maybe a tad repetitive), hot looking babes, a decent enough story and acting which won't win any Oscars but isn't that bad really.

","I'm starting to wonder if we're seeing the same movies as the critics nowadays. Or at least, if we're getting different cuts of movies. Because I've often found myself walking out going ""Did I see a different movie than the critics?"" <br/><br/>Of course, Snyder is no stranger to critical disdain. He may be the most misunderstood director out there. True his films aren't for everyone, but if you look close enough you may just find something there. And Sucker Punch is the biggest example of how big a visionary he is- Here he manages to bring to the table a satisfying and exciting new vision.<br/><br/>I was in right from the opening scene. A cover of Sweet Dreams set to a fantastic and tone setting scene depicting her abuse from her wicked stepfather. WHAT an opening scene.<br/><br/>We are then transported to Mount Pleasant Insane Asylum, once a performing arts venue. Baby Doll is just a drop in the ocean of how many beautiful girls who can dance. Baby Doll doesn't know this until she saves Rocket, another one of the girls. There she meets the rest of the gang, and the sexy Goski, a doctor who has a form of therapy- dance. When Baby Doll dances, she can slay dragons, fight robots, wield swords, etc. The girls love her- but as it stands, she's dancing... to escape from the asylum with the girls.<br/><br/>The concept may not sound dazzling- but wait till you see it. Sucker Punch is what its title states- a conceptual sucker punch. Nothing can prepare you for what you will experience. You are in the world with Baby Doll- you feel as if you are experiencing Baby Doll's therapy with her. Snyder totally does a great job with this aspect, and as a theatre nerd and dance lover, arts as therapy really hit home because it's very true, and I've experienced that euphoria from being a performer.<br/><br/>The acting is fantastic, and Emily Browning is great as both an action chick and a confused, disturbed girl. Cugino is sexy and adds her usual charm to her role. Hamm as Blue is easily the best, as his villain is certainly convincing.<br/><br/>Add to that, one of the best soundtracks ever put to film. Working with Tyler Bates, Browning covers a few songs, and quite a few others contribute too. And Bjork's ""Army of Me"" has never sounded cooler.<br/><br/>I was sceptical- Snyder has struck gold with 300, Watchmen and Guardians, but could he manage to make one of his original ideas spark? As a result he can- and he did. Do NOT be a puppet of the critics- experience Sucker Punch with an open mind. Touche, Zack Snyder... Touche."
"jonnyhavey","2","44","93","27 March 2011"," Viewer: Sucker Punch to the Face
","Director Zack Snyder's (""300,"" ""Watchmen"") latest film, ""Sucker Punch"" can be described by one word: bummer. Snyder is known for making films with very detailed, enthralling visual splendor. However, he proves that visuals are not enough to successfully create a good film. Starting with a brief back-story of a girl known as Babydoll (Emily Browning, ""The Uninvited"") and ending with an attempted metaphorical message, the plot is lost in the midst of action. Babydoll's story takes place in 1955 with the death of her mother leading to the attempted rape of Babydoll and her sister by their Stepfather (Gerard Plunkett, ""2012""). In order to stop her father from succeeding she tries to shoot him, but accidentally misses shooting her sister instead. She immediately drops the gun and begins running, however, she cannot escape the clutches of her Stepfather. After the police come she is taken to an insane asylum for girls known as the Lennox House. Her Stepfather pays off one of the orderlies named Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac, ""Robin Hood"") to forge the signature of Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino, ""Watchmen"") to have her lobotomized by the Doctor (Jon Hamm, ""Mad Men""). While in the mental institution, Babydoll meets fellow inmates Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish, ""Limitless""), Rocket (Jena Malone, ""The Messenger"") Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens, ""High School Musical""), and Amber (Jamie Chung, ""Grown Ups""). Immediately following, Snyder takes the audience deep within Babydoll's mind creating an ""Inception-like"" mental design of three layers. In the second layer Babydoll transforms the mental institution into a cathouse where her and her companions are just a group of entrapped prostitutes. In this mental state Babydoll is taught to dance by Madam Gorski, taking her one level further for the duration of her dance. In the deepest level she is given a mission by a Wise Man (Scott Glenn, ""Secretariat"") leading her to escape the mental hospital. Together Babydoll and her fellow inmates complete a set of five tasks in hopes of escaping before Babydoll is given to the High Roller (Also Jon Hamm) in the brothel synonymous with her lobotomy in reality.<br/><br/>It goes without saying the only reason anyone should see this film is to see Snyder's renowned graphic grandeur. Snyder mixes of light and dark with vibrant colors to distinguish the inner most layer of Babydoll's mind from the blandness of the rest of the film. Here Snyder creates entertaining action sequences in the backdrop of his graphic effects and has a little help from Jena Malone and Scott Glenn's performances.<br/><br/>""Sucker Punch"" is synonymous with a rolling ball of flaws attributed to a variety of different shortcomings. The film starts with very weird character development as Babydoll acts as nothing more than a mime until she finally speaks 30 minutes into the film. The viewer is also hit immediately with an over the top soundtrack playing a different song every five minutes undermining the integrity of each scene. The casting for the film is almost as random as the soundtrack with a wide range of B-list actresses coming from a variety of different backgrounds. Exhibit A: Vanessa Hudgens. What were you thinking Snyder? ""High School Musical"" to ""Sucker Punch""? Need I say more? While, along with the fact that Emily Browning and Jamie Chung may as well be labeled as unknowns, Oscar Isaac and Carla Gugino are out of place in this film. Also, it really is sad that the best actor in the film, Jon Hamm, is only in the film for a minute or two. This combined with a very poorly written script massacred the film creating horrid situational clichés and predictable outcomes.<br/><br/>One-dimensional characters and an ending reaching for metaphorical meaning vastly overshadow Snyder's special effects. Therefore the only special thing about Snyder's latest film is the fact that the viewer gets ""Sucker Punched"" in the face as the film goes down as one of the greatest letdowns of 2011."

","This is my first review on IMDb, and I think that this is an important one because for those who have seen Sucker Punch and actually got it, awesome and kudos to you. For those who didn't what is wrong with you?<br/><br/>If you can get past the hot women, explosions, dragons and other eye candy, this is a very spiritual movie. it is about how when you look deep within yourself you can accomplish anything.<br/><br/>Our main character Baby Doll (Emily Browning) accidentally kills her sister and is framed by her father for murder. This is because he stands to lose a lot due to the will of the recently deceased mother. In order to maintain his wealth he has her committed to an insane asylum and scheduled for a lobotomy.<br/><br/>In order to survive she must find the strength in herself to overcome obstacles in the real world. Her guide for this is veteran actor Scott Glenn (Wise Man). He assigns her special missions (in a spiritual realm within herself) to obtain keys to unlocking her full potential in the real world.<br/><br/>Each mission she teams up with other patients from the mental institute to accomplish these and as she completes the missions she also unlocks pieces they need to escape in the real world. The different trials all tie into the real world in some way.<br/><br/>This is saying when you look inside yourself and find the strength, you can accomplish anything. It is an amazing metaphor and can get lost in the razzle dazzle of the glitz and glam of the movie if you are not spiritually in tune with yourself enough to see it.<br/><br/>The same can be said of other great movies like Star Wars, where it is all about spirituality (the force).<br/><br/>Evelios"

","Fortunately for me, I watched this film with absolutely zero expectations.<br/><br/>I missed all the original hype, and it was purely by 'chance' that a piece of music that I'd heard on youtube led me to Sucker Punch.<br/><br/>I fell in love with this film from the very beginning. I let myself be carried along on a wonderful visual and musical journey, a fantasy within a fantasy laced with layers of meaning that need not be analysed ... simply absorbed.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is a work of Art that will surely become a cult classic once the haters have finished tearing it apart and gone away to find other films that give them what they want without 'sucker punching' their linear minds.<br/><br/>It's an unfortunate human trait that people feel the need to deride and destroy that which they don't understand. They can't simply say ""I don't get it"", or ""it isn't for me"". Somehow they feel threatened ... they feel that they should 'get it', and if they don't 'get it' it must be inherently bad.<br/><br/>And it's not as if there's much to 'get'. The film won't reveal 'the meaning of life' to you, although it might just reinforce the 'meaning' of your life. I guess that some people are looking so hard for deeper meaning that they miss the simple and obvious.<br/><br/>If you've never seen Sucker Punch, please give it a try, and as you watch it, simply let it play out before you without trying to analyse. And if it really doesn't hold any great 'meaning' for you ... so what? ... you've just been treated to a beautifully filmed fantasy with some of the coolest fight choreography/dancing you'll ever see!<br/><br/>""If you don't stand for something you'll fall for anything.""

","This was a good representation of how the human mind can escape from the harsh reality of pain. A young girl buries her mother, and her step father abuses her relentlessly after he learns that her mother left the estate to both her and her sister. But in his rage, decides to rid himself of the girls and institutionalize the older Emily Browning (Babydoll) after her younger sister was killed accidentally by her own hand. During her stay in the asylum, her tragedies continue which propels her mind to a state of harmony using combat. Now in a world of her own, she deals with the outside forces using combat skills using a Katana and gun. In the midst of this, and while in her fantasy she works in a brothel theatre where she helps others by a means of escape from a maniacal owner by the use of dancing. During her dances, her mind alternates between the real and the unreal. Now using her skills, she has a new direction to help her friends escape the brothel to freedom. With the help of Amber (Jamie Chung) and Sweet pea (Abbie Cornish) along with her younger sister Rocket (Jena Malone). As well as Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens). Together Babydoll is now a fully armed force to get the girls out of the Brothel permanently. What really gave this film a good twist, was when Babydoll is then brought back to reality where her lobotomy is occurring. This has a parallel to another movie called Brazil. Terry Gilliams box office smash. Yet in this film, it is brought up more than enough notches to keep the audience riveted. What made this film so dazzling as well is the effects, music, and a great appearance by Scott Glen. He is to say, a metaphor for Babydolls courage. A teacher of sorts. This was a great movie for a psycho thriller. Highly Recommended."

","I had high expectations for this film ever since I saw the first trailer. The film's target audience seemed pretty predictable, but with Zack Snyder I knew he'd deliver more. I'm in love with ""300"" and ""Watchmen"" so I you already know he plans on succeeding on many levels, and as usual he doesn't disappoint. The beauty of it all is that this is an original story, and so I'm looking forward to his future projects.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying the story itself will start off kind of cryptic, but if you analyze it properly you'll keep up. The acting was so spot on with these characters, their beauty was only a plus. I had been worrying about Vanessa Hudgens' capabilities, but she did rather well I must admit. Jena Malone was my personal favorite, and she portrayed her character perfectly. Emily Bowning was spectacular and Oscar Isaac came off pretty damn menacing. Carla Gugino was also pretty good as well, and Scott Glenn was a very enjoyable character. You quickly embrace them all, despite the fact you know little about them all. I don't want to spoil much but I will quickly go over what makes this film so enjoyable. The soundtrack and score were amazing to listen to, giving the film a very surreal feel to it. Of course covers can never surpass the original piece of music, but still Yoav and Emily Browning is great. It keeps the film energetic yet appropriately ominous and dark when necessary. The cinematography and action scenes are incredibly elaborate and the CGI is well used. Every scene is just insane and a real treat to watch.<br/><br/>Let alone being a superbly visual film overall, it works on a psychological stand point as well. Its themes are powerful, best summed up that reality can be harsh and cruel, nut it is better to die free than live in damn nation. I believe ""Sucker Punch"" is going to be a hard hitter for 2011, despite the many ignorant reviews dismissing it. Don't listen to the critics this time."

I should have followed my hunch that looking at the trailer told me better not waste your time on this one but I wanted to give it a try because I like fantasy type movies and is hard to find stories in which we have a heroine not a hero , sadly the heroine storyline was a mixture of some porn fantasy and some Japanese manga There is nothing I could rescue from the movie as OK , event the effects linked to the spacing out of our table dancer/heroine are not enough to help the movie. Of course the high score is from the target audience of young males with too much testosterone that fail to see the message between lines of the underworld of woman trafficking and slavery going on around the world .

","So there are many things to look at in Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch. Aside from the spectacular visuals, the gorgeous actresses, this will be Snyder's first attempt at directing something wholly from his own mind. No comic book to adapt, no beloved monster movie to remake, this will be Snyder's first ""original"" effort. So does it succeed? Kind of, but I'm left wanting more.<br/><br/>While the story is very interesting, it's held down by a mediocre script. Actually, the first 20 minutes have no dialog, so the film becomes a music video for remixed 80s songs involving dreams as Emily Browning emptily sleepwalks through the asylum, occasionally showing some emotion towards the end of this boring prologue. Now I've seen introductions that are silent and carry a lot of emotional weight (see ""Up""), but there's really nothing interesting going on here except Snyder's trademark slow-mo, speed-up shtick. The film's actors and actresses do a fine job with what they are given, but the script doesn't give them anything to do. As a matter of fact, Joe Hamm appears towards the end and he seems completed wasted for someone of his acting caliber. All in all, there's not a drop of good character development to be found here and it becomes painfully noticeable as the film goes on. Then again, people are not seeing this film for the plot but to seem some style, and the film can back that up. When Baby Doll's first crazy dream begins, the film does take flight and does not stop for a good while.<br/><br/>When the film goes into dream mode, it becomes something truly special. The first is a fight that involves a young girl armed with a samurai blade and pistol facing off three giant robot samurai. Words could not do justice as to how kick-ass the first sequence was; and it only improves with the film's three other dream sequences. The fight scenes are brutal and are hyper-violent, reminiscent of Snyder's own ""300"". As far as representing what 13-year-old boys probably dream about, the film succeeds in every regard (and I mean that in the nicest possible way). The audience is transported to WWI trenches overrun by German soldiers brought to life by clockworks and steam; then to a Helm's Deep-esque siege on a castle where a fire-breathing dragon hangs out; and off to a spectacular fight against androids aboard a hijacked train. But the fights become so ridiculously over-the-top that I wondered how the hell did this film wound up with a PG-13 rating and not R (like Snyder himself anticipated). Then I realized there is no blood in any of these dream sequences. Oddly blood is only present in the real world and it's never gratuitous. But bear in mind, that's not a criticism against the film, but it is something for parents to keep in mind if they decide to make a family outing of this. I beg you to not do so.<br/><br/>The reason I say this is because this is NOT a kid's movie. People die violent, unromantic deaths here, and the film gets dark as hell in Act III. But I think it get's TOO dark for an action-adventure movie like this. The whole time we are treated to an over-the-top style that begs for an air of fun, but the fun immediately switches to melodrama when the final dream sequence is complete. Then the not-at-all fun ending comes to put a damper on the whole room. I will give Snyder chops for having the balls to carry out such a bold ending, though I can see why Warner Brothers was grumbling about the film. Simply put, I have a feeling a lot of people will be turned off by the ending. <br/><br/>Which is a shame, because the previous two hours were so damn good. While the film's beginning is slow, when the action hits, it hits hard and keeps going, constantly one-upping itself in terms of what you will see next. Yes, Snyder employs the ol' speed up, slow-mo trick multiple times during the dream sequences, but they are not overdone and allow the audience to make sense of hyper-kinetic chaos going on. And mind you, with these dreams alone, I was ready to recommend anyone to see it. But then the third act hits, and I can't honestly bring myself to give that recommendation as the film's flaws become too apparent. Nonetheless, I was never bored in the film's 109 run time and the visuals are truly striking. It's a wonderful blend of CGI, grit, and dark color palette that gives the film a unique style on its own. At the end of the day, what we have here is a classic case of style over substance. If you love to see cool stuff go up on a big screen, I'll check this out as a matinée. For everyone else, this is a rental at best."

","""Sucker Punch"" is basically disappointing but also obviously gonna fail because it was directed by Zack ""The Slow-Mo"" Snyder. Well Snyder is only good at visuals. This movie is not an adaptation. He created the story to make his visual talent more useful. The story can be interesting but this fantasy/video gamey world was pointless although it was the whole point of the movie, the reason why we are attracted to this. His directing is still slow and messed up. The action is slow. Everything is slow. It's just sad.<br/><br/>The first act was like a playlist of music videos. It's a good way to start the film. The second act started to become pointless until the end. They're coming to this imaginary world without any sense or any connection to the reality until the last visit. Like I say this movie's existence is for the visuals but it's clunky to the story.<br/><br/>If there is something that I liked in this movie then it's Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, and Oscar Isaac. They are the only ones who had a decent performance. Carla Gugino was also good. The other cast, Emily Browning is like Bella Swan holding guns and swords. Vanessa Hudgens doesn't have the guts to be tough. Scott Glenn needed more scenes.<br/><br/>The other thing that I liked in this film is the visual effects of course. But this eye-candy merit was slapped by Snyder's directing style called Slow-Mo. His slow-mos are just senseless and boring. Ninjas, zombie Nazis, dragons, robots, and hot chicks in one movie can be fun but their mixture in this film is just nonsense. The movie is nonsense. It's not imaginative. It's just a mess.<br/><br/>""Sucker Punch"" is like ""Scott Pilgrim The Movie"" in a bad way. At least the absurdity of ""Scott Pilgrim"" had a lot of sense, but this in a realistic serious world meets preposterous is strangely mismatched. I think a video game fan and a kid will enjoy this (or not). Overall ""Sucker Punch"" is a turtley fantasy mess. They say it's ""Alice in Wonderland with machine guns"". Well ""Alice in Wonderland"" is smarter than this. You want hot chicks? Guess what. Abbie Cornish is HOTT!"

Also the characters of Sweet Pea and Rocket seem to be the most developed...<br/><br/>Now for the action and the effects and visuals... DROOL! The special effects are flawless in my opinion, the action scene with the 3 big samurai is seriously the best action scene I've ever seen! I really like the little touches to their costumes and weapons like the cute little anime bracelets on Baby Doll's gun! The girls did a great job with the stunts! They didn't overdo with the actions scenes, they're incorporated really well into the movie. But once they start... wow! They pretty much covered everything!:D<br/><br/>Since I'm an anime fan, this movie is pure sex for me! The only thing I would've liked is another culminating action scene and villain, the second part of the film was a little less epic... But still, nice work not ending it like everyone expects it to end! It gave it a deeper meaning... Maybe it was even better that way... The movie is probably more a 7 or 8 (mostly for non-anime fans etc.), but I'm giving it 9/10 because of the directing/music used and the character of Baby Doll! Really I think this is the best anime movie ''adaptation'' (if such has even existed before).<br/><br/>To summarize, GO WATCH THIS!:D You'll have so much fun! I'm probably gonna go watch it again in a few days^^..."
"thebackofmyhouse","6","24","49","24 March 2011"," Snyder let loose is not a good Snyder
","I loved all of Zack Snyder's films up until this one. This is his first original film, not one based on an existing properties. It seems he has these great action set pieces thought out in his mind but no movie to put it in. So he has written his own movie where all these action set pieces can be realized. This is what the movie feels like. An excuse for a few actions scenes. I have to admit, Snyder knows how to direct action, but for some reason, when it comes to this movie, he seems to loose his touch. Even though there are no shaky camera, there's another thing that dampens the action scenes, it the fast-panning. For this movie he wants the audience to get close to the action, so there's a lot of close ups, but there's a lot of panning too to show what's gong on. There isn't enough wide shots. It's the wide shots which are the highlights of the action scenes. And another downer is that the story in itself contributes to the weightlessness of the action. It is supposed to take place inside an imagination so the viewer never really feels as if the girls are in real danger. It is very easy for the girls to defeat those monster/robot bad guys. The only time when there was really any sense of danger was the fight scene in the trenches. The other scenes, the bad guys are just walk-overs. The acting wasn't that good either. So, as a fan of Zack Snyder, I'm disappointed. I hope his Superman is better."

","Sucker punch is a very good message movie cloaked in a scifi movie with hot girls. I will not spoil the plot I will just let you know that there is hardly any cussing, the violence is done in a non gory/ classy way. The movie is a very good movie for a teen with a positive message while it still being what movies were meant for entertainment. Just like his movie 300 which although gory and action heavy had good themes of self sacrifice and not taking the easy road this movie also has a positive message and is more teen friendly and if you are a parent I would not have a problem with my teen seeing this one.<br/><br/>Hopefully it will do well so that more directors will make inventive movies like this one rather than cashing in on the lame comedies that for some reason always do well.<br/><br/>Also the special effect and locations were amazing and the acting was pretty good. Great story that flowed well even though it had a reality and a fantasy it still made easy sense. Not like that mess of a movie inception. Suckerpuch had a director with a clear vision of what he wanted and I feel it flowed well on screen. First movie I've seen in a theater this year and even though good movies are rare anymore, it makes me appreciate them even more with all the lame ones pushed out each week.<br/><br/>Kevin"

Also creators tried so hard to stay within PG13 ratings, that the result is a film which is pointless and naive to a mature viewer and way too suggestive and confusing to a youth.

","I went into this film expecting a fun, over-the-top action-packed movie with an okay story. I was very curious about this movie and I wish I never sat down to watch it.<br/><br/>The storytelling was terrible. First off, our main character is somewhat established as we see she has a brutal relationship with her stepfather...only it is done in a music video sort of fashion. Right there, you instantly don't care for the character as much because you don't feel her pain. There's no real dialog or emotions that happen. Instead, it was like a music video as it glosses over her background. The rest of the characters aren't well established, and neither is the rest of this story. We have dancers, who dance to impress men. We then enter the mind of our main character when she dances and all of a sudden, this timid girl knows how to fight and kick ass with all kinds of weapons? She is now the leader of the pack? This movie was like combining Black Swan and Inception, and just ruining both stories! There was a lot of pointless action with tons of CGI effects that weren't worth the hype. I felt like I was watching a dumb video game on the big screen. <br/><br/>This movie was pointless and it was very dull as there was little suspense and some very not so intimidating antagonists. Zach Snyder has had some solid movies in the past, but unfortunately, this movie was a black eye. We (the audience) get sucker punched when watching this mess of a film."
"darkplague2010","9","7","11","29 March 2012"," Wicked Visuals & Rockin Soundtrack! (possible spoiler alert-just to be on the safe side)
","Originally when I saw this was under the ""fantasy"" genre, I wasn't too interested, being a solid horror movie/true crime fan. But after I read what it was about, I decided to check it out. One hell of a movie! I read the reviews & msg boards regarding ""Sucker Punch"" & while I respect everyone's opinion, I don't agree with the ""depressing"" aspect that I kept reading. I didn't remember this movie being released at theatres, but after watching a bit of it, I came in about 20 min after it started, I wanted to know more. My natural ""want to know what, why, & everything in between"" kicked in, so I recorded it to my DVR. I loved the soundtrack & was able to find both ""Army of Me"" & ""Search & Destroy"" on iTunes. I was a little disappointed at the ending though. In the middle of watching the movie I did go to IMDb & the msg boards & yes, I did read the spoilers, but they weren't exactly ""spoilers"" because they didn't tell what this movie was REALLY about, nor did they tell anything to ruin it. Unfortunately, there are TONS of places like Lennox House & have been for decades. There are also people just like the ""doctors"" in these same places, just like the characters in this movie. I found myself thinking about this movie long after I finished watching it, which is rare for me. I don't see too many feature length films that I want to see again, but this is one I will add to that list. The action sequences are awesome & the visuals are stunning. The meshing of different eras in time was a brilliant move. I thought at first it would be confusing, but like the 1st review on here, you simply need to pay attention & don't miss anything. You find yourself rooting for the girls to win. But, as it is with real life, it rarely turns out that way. I do feel that I must comment on one of the msg board comments: self-sacrifice IS a virtue. Though you may feel that avoiding self-sacrifice is the virtue, rather than the act itself, I don't agree with that. Throughout history, if not for thousands & thousands of acts of self-sacrifice, we'd find our world a very different & probably not very pleasant place to be. We all look for a happy ending, whether it's in real life, a book or a film, only in a writer's imagination can that be assured. Though, I must say, there are times in real life where a happy ending does happen. The reason I gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10, was simply because of the ending. After all Baby Doll had gone through, from the start of the movie to the end, I really wanted it to be her happy ending. Though many people will criticize this movie for one reason or another, I recommend giving it a chance. It's a cerebral visual feast for the eyes & brain. As with the other reviewer, you just have to take the movie as it is & enjoy. Yes, even ""dark"" films (not my description, but one on the board) can be just as good."
"DazeOfHeaven69","3","33","71","25 March 2011"," A Disappointing Movie (Considering Zack's Previous Achievements)
","Just got back from the midnight premier of Sucker Punch and I can say that I am disappointed. Being a huge fan of Zack Snyder's films since Dawn of the Dead, I was expecting another classic. The first 10 minutes or so of the movie are a slow mo montage intro which he seems to think is his ""trademark"" now. I thought, hey this looks incredible. And it does. The film itself looks visually amazing. The problems arose when people started speaking. THE DIALOGUE IS AWFUL. I laughed at literally 80% of all the lines said in this movie. I couldn't tell if the movie was serious or if it was more of a Sam Raimi style film on Comic-Book style movies. What I couldn't understand is, after watching all the excited interviews with the cast and crew talking about how great it was, how they even thought they were making a good film. Maybe the script looked really good on paper, but the movie itself was just all over the place. I wont get into the details about the alternate realities and such that people have already described, rather I'll talk about what I think lies at the heart of the problem.<br/><br/>This film is pretentious. This is Snyder getting too powerful with all of the money he has brought in doing what he loves. EVERYTHING in this film is in his head. The job of the director, however, is to communicate a story to the audience. The story itself made no sense, at least in my mind. The only redeeming thing about the movie was its visual effects which, while stunning, were not good enough to fill the gap left by all the shallowness of the movie. <br/><br/>The whole time I kept thinking, ""God, Zack. This better be a joke."" And maybe it was. I can picture it now. Zack and his producers sitting around a table. ""I'll make you guys a bet,"" he says ""that we can make the silliest, worst movie ever. Put my name on it, add in some slow- mo sequences, and it will make back its budget and then some. What do you think?""<br/><br/>""Well, what did you have in mind Zack?""<br/><br/>""I'm thinking Alice in Wonderland...Only with guns.""<br/><br/>Dear God, Zack. How you got a studio to produce this film i will never know. The thing that bugs me the most is that Zack seems to be a talented director. He certainly is one of the most visual directors in Hollywood. I had really high hopes for him. The problem is that he can't write a story. He may be able to direct it, but he can't write it. And that's where Sucker Punch falls flat: The writing. You can't really tell a good story if the story is sh*t to begin with."

Yup all these things are in SuckerPunch. Now do any of things have anything to do with anything? Nope these are all things just thrown in to show look what I can do with cg! That's all this movie is. The acting sucks, the story is undefined, the main character is defeated and lobotomized in the end and a chunk of this movie has stolen scenes from other movies and video games. The cgi scene where they have to steal a bomb codenamed ""knife"" from a train I honestly thought what the bloody hell...... none of that scene was original. They board a train which rides on floating railways. This being the exact same train from the video game Final Fantasy 13 in the opening sequence. Once inside they have to defeat the robots from I-Robot. When trying to steal the bomb the character rocket bends down on one knee and reaches behind her back and pulls out one of those orange and black explosives the black gaurds use in Tron legacy and then blah blah blah.

"bob the moo","Null","23","47","7 July 2011"," Not as awful as you have heard but just empty, noisy, pointless, heartless and cynically commercial
","Of course I had heard all the negative reviews when I sat to watch this. Of course I had seen the MTV-friendly action trailer. But critics can be biased and marketing can be misleading, so I decided to give this a go. On the face of it this film could have been similar to Pan's Labyrinth in regards the idea of a young girl/woman living through hardship and extending that hardship into a fantasy world of demons and otherworldly creatures. Certainly after watching the first very stylish fifteen minutes this felt like a film that would take this foundation of abuse and deep physiological injury and do something exciting, interesting and clever with it – at least, that's how it felt it could have been.<br/><br/>The problem is that, despite setting up these themes, the film does nothing with them – nothing at all. The dual fantasy sequences do not connect to any of the ideas or possible themes but rather represent an action sequence in the place of a (often mundane) aspect of the girl's plan to escape the burlesque house (which itself is a fantasy version of the mental institution). So for example when Babydoll dances to distract the mayor to allow the others to pickpocket a cigarette lighter , we cut away to a sequence of the girls raiding a castle to kill a dragon and steal the crystals that make it breathe fire. It might as well be a different film in these action sequences, and indeed they are – but the problem is that these sequences seem to be the film that Snyder wanted to make.<br/><br/>In fairness these massively dumb action sequences are full of style and presentation with impressive effects. They work for what they are and, even though the slow-mo, use of music and overall design is derivative, it does still provide plenty of style. But they aren't connected to anything in the film and this means that they have the same effect as they do in the trailer – ""oh, that's fancy"" but nothing more. There is no heart to them and as such these parts of the film are nothing more than another blockbuster with loads of effects but nothing else.<br/><br/>The lack of anything else is what kills the film because by the halfway point the empty noise becomes nothing more than noise. It is not even that it fails to make something of the ideas, characters and story – it is that it simply has no desire to do anything with them – like it is happy to be nothing. This annoyed me and it gets worse as the ending of the film attempts to suddenly have a darkness, to have a heart – it is too little too late and it doesn't work. In the absence of ideas to interest the viewer, one is left to think about other things. The exploitative fetishism of school-girl outfits, guns, sexuality and violence is one such thing I thought about – particularly since it was in a film whose final lines of dialogue appear to lift up the women characters. The sexual costumes and imagery do nothing of the sort but there is not some underlying misogyny as some have claimed – it is simply another part of Synder making his film as emptily commercial as possible, and sexy young women being sexy sells – just as gun porn and special effects sell. The cast match this as well – occasionally they look like they could have delivered more but ultimately they are little more than sexual effects. Browning, Cornish and Malone have a bit of heart to them but Hudgens and Chung are just flesh (not that I minded too much). This is not a film that cares about its cast – and the audience won't either.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is not as awful as you have heard – it is too expensive and stylish for that. No, it is just poor because it simply does nothing other than empty, heartless style that is noisy and pointless. The ideas and themes go nowhere and the film has no interest in them or the characters. All that matters is slow-motion, cool music, big action and comic book style – if that is all you want without caring about any of it then this will fill your ears and eyes for a while – but if you want more then best give this a miss."
"HuskyEnzo","1","23","47","6 April 2011"," Completing the trilogy which ""Van Helsing"" and ""Sky Captain"" began: ""Melting Plot III - Moron Rouge""
","I got into the car on Sunday afternoon. The friend who invited me for a movie of my choice for my birthday leaned over to me; ""This one got a really bad review in the paper,"" she said. ""Look, "" I replied ""all I'm asking is that I don't wanna need to think, okay?"" Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it. Sitting in the theater, next to me there sat two smelly noisy guys who commented regularly and loud the scenes, eating nachos like pigs do and apparently thinking they were funny. The sad thing was that after a quarter hour or so they didn't distract or annoy me anymore watching the film. Can there be any worse verdict? After 20 minutes I thought that any movie gets the audience it deserves. The  story  no, I can't call it that way! The film starts with an orphan-story from the cliché-wing. A Britney-Spears-lookalike brat accidentally shoots her sister in an attempt to protect her from their violent father, just briefly after the mother passed away. The greedy pop uses the chance to get rid of the only other heir and dumps her in a lunatic asylum. There the girl is supposed to lobotomized (an irritating ""Cuckoo's Nest"" reference) and –facing the traumatizing process- her mind disconnects and she ""flees"" into an imaginary world where she gets abducted, sold to a strip-club (an allegory to the asylum) and practically enslaved with the other girls to dance and to  well to do what can be imagined. In order to escape this fictional joint -into which she actually already hid from reality- she convinces the other dancers of a break-out. To acquire the items they need (knife, fire, map and uh y'see?), she mentally flees during her dance-performances once more from that meta-level into the NEXT meta-level, a fantasy-world which is a pop cultural and historical melting-pot of various alternated historical events, steam-punk- and other computer-game-scenarios, Anime/Manga and bubblegum-philosophy. WWII (or WWI?) is one of the settings, as well as ""Lord Of The Rings"", a Shinto-temple and an OuterPlanet. Goofs found: the Nazi-troopers were supposed to be zombies. Zombies don't mind a kick to the crotch and thereby can't be stopped that way AND they have no use for gas-masks! The mediocre and tension-free action sequences are interrupted by ""Baby-Doll's"" back-falls to the ""reality"", the strip-joint, with pseudo-tragic, cliché-drowning scenes and main-characters which show one other of the films most essential problems: it blatantly serves the reactionary and indifferent Arabophobia by introducing the club-owner ""Blue"", a poorly performed but clearly racism-feeding parody of a Persian. Compared to that, Kevin J. O'Connel's performance in ""The Mummy"" was balanced, fair and PC. About the way, the factual psychiatric function of Disconnecting as shown here I must say: I'm fairly skeptical. But worse than that, the premise that a traumatized woman seeks relief by mentally escaping into a dreamworld where she gets sexually abused might imply that women dream of being sexually exploited more than anything else. Regardless the fact that rape-fantasies exist and are as legitimate or not as most others, for a movie that addresses a juvenile audience this is simply irresponsible. Another ""PPPffffffrrrrzzz"" goes out to the character's names like ""Baby-Doll"", ""Sweet Pee"", ""High-Roller"" or the likes; aw come on As if the author took the promoters speeches from ""Mad Max II"" for serious. Yes I'm aware that this flick WANTS to play with clichés but face it: it sounds plain idiotic. Period. So all in all this film's premise is basically the pattern-bastard of the terrific ""Pan's Labyrinth"", where also a little girl in a traumatizing and hostile family-situation during the fascistic Franco-reign in Spain mentally escapes into a- world of unlimited imagination and so beyond life and death. But while Del Toro's masterpiece can even be named in one line as for instance great old European classics as Ingmar Bergmann's ""Fanny and Alexander"", this kaleidoscope of trash hasn't any own identity, nor any value as a movie-reference-galore. Not to mention any substantial message to take away. As a social-worker who works with mentally ill people for 11 years now, I furthermore have to state that mental institutions in earlier times surely must have been hell. I don't have problems to see that used as a stylistic element or scenario in a movie – not even in a blockbuster. But here it only serves voyeuristic pranksters and feeds the prejudices about mentally affected people in a dangerous way. I'm also an RPG-player for over 15 years now and I must point out, that if ever one of our games-masters would have dared to show up with such a pile of sedative ""powergaming"" (roughly for ""when it's too simple and obvious"", such as killing a dragon with one slit – yeah. Sure.), we would have hung the bastard. It's a dance-movie  without dance-sequences, a horror-film without being creepy, an action-film with boring action, a war-movie where you tend to root for Nazis because the heroines are so annoying. I can't believe that this idiotic crap was done by the same man who did the excellent ""Dawn Of The Dead""-remake in  2007? Don't waste any money watching this rubbish, you better watch ""Barb Wire"" once more (Yes! I mean it!) or best of all: call all your friends and make a complete ""Firefly""-DVD-Session over the weekend; at least that was my decision after the ""Train Job""-sequence: this series action was better, the characters too, the sexism was more enjoyable and had more style, the wit was funnier – in short: forget this waste. I would have never ever expected that someone could shoot a movie BELOW ""Van Helsing"" or ""Sky Captain"" – but here we are  deeper underground. Trilogy completed. In many years at least we will be able to say: ""Oh yes, there once WAS one crappy movie, even Scott Glenn couldn't rescue. What was the title? Hrmmm"""

","The main character gets confined to a mental asylum for reasons that stop being important once she is inside (for the rest of the movie). There, she flashes a weird burlesque world slightly related to the real world. and there, she flashes another world which is pure fantasy. This flashy third world has the cool action that we want to see. sadly it doesn't work at all, since nothing there makes sense. She finds suddenly turned into a super powered chick who fights robots, Nazis, dragons and samurais. Who are them? nobody. Why does she fight them? No reason. What if she loses the fight? We don't know. Who gives a damn then about them? Well, not me. Of course, after we start to see that her actions there mean something in the real world (actually it's not the real world either) but it's already too late. We see the first fight without caring about it since it doesn't have a background at all. And that transfers to all the rest.<br/><br/>Some of the actors were good but many of them have the problem of having to act a scene that makes no sense at all and that hurts their performances really bad. The perfect example of this is the doctor that lobotomizes her, having to repeat the ""there was a creepy look in her eyes"" speech like 5 times to make the audience believe it.<br/><br/>It's sad that all those good action scenes fell flat for the lack of story. When I saw the first action scene versus the samurais (the best one by far) I thought: ""Man!! if I had this one action scene alone at the end after a great movie with good characters I'd been totally happy. No need for more action than this in a well constructed movie."" of course, I was able to think that so early cause the fatal flaw of the movie was all exposed already.<br/><br/>the movie is very bad, not wordy off your money !!!!!!!!"

","The fact that somebody is a director doesn't mean they know how to write a film script. Even the fact they are great writers doesn't mean that, Sartre's script for the Freud movie being a case in point. Zack Snider's latest attempt at movie-making, ""Sucker Punch"" is a punch indeed... to the viewer's patience. The storyline is almost nonexistent, the CGI battle sequences are mostly boring, the plot premises are weak (to say the least), and the bet on the bet on Emilie Browning's (Baby Doll) beauty to enthrall the viewer fails miserably: she looks SO artificial that I couldn't even find her mildly pretty. Perhaps that was intentional, but then, the movie would require a modicum of storyline to keep going. And there is none. From the start, when the girl is incomprehensibly shoved into an asylum instead of answering an inquiry (where the attempted rape by the stepfather would - inconveniently to Zack's bad plot - have come up, she is put into an Arkham-like asylum. Add to it the fact that the whorehouse fantasy with the game character fantasy inside it simply do not carry on a convincing story, because there is no background to them. The move just does not connect the dots. And Baby Doll's character is supposed NOT to be insane (and her being 20 years old makes it even more unconvincing - if she were 5, the badly connected senseless fantasies would be make more sense). To top it up, the video game sequences are just plain boring. Just special effects with 300-imitation CGI visual are not enough to carry long sequences of senseless battles with no real plot to support them. Compare this with Hero, a great movie, with stupendous actions sequences, a stunning visual (way better - because poetical and plot-helping, instead of merely technological - than Zack can ever hope to achieve) and a wonderfully deep, complex and simple plot to boot! Profoundly disappointing. A great idea for a plot just plain wasted."

","I saw this at Warner Bros. where I work. Really like Zach's visual style, but man, is he weak on story. So many things are not well played out. The girls are at an asylum, but no one acts crazy. The fantasy world of the movie feels like set pieces for an upcoming video game. There are times when the girls seem to be capable of anything, and other times hopelessly ineffective. One last thing, if you're going to use rock music in a score, use the originals, or at least have killer versions by new artists. Glad I saw it, but I'm really getting tired of cartoon movies and cartoon characters. Zach Snyder has so much promise in this industry, and I'm really pulling for him, but I think his only home run so far has been ""300""."

","In a day when Hollywood craves good original screenplays, Sucker Punch proves that some filmmakers should stick to adapting great source material. An exuberantly bad pastiche of genres, Sucker Punch is the anti-Quentin Tarantino film. Zack Snyder's story is mashup of several different genres, none of which prove successful in the long run. The number of believable lines in Snyder's screenplay can be counted on two hands, thus providing very little material for the potentially good cast of women to work with. Snyder clearly doesn't know how to construct a visually disinteresting shot, but it all doesn't matter because the film trips over its own feet constantly.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is told from the point-of-view of Babydoll (Emily Browning), a young girl who is sent to an asylum by her father after she accidentally kills her sister in the bravado opening sequence. It isn't too long before Babydoll realizes that she is scheduled for a lobotomy. Her vivid fantasies cause her to realize escaping is her only way to survive. Babydoll enlists the help of the girls in her ward to help guide her through her intense journey out of the asylum. The supporting cast includes Abbie Cornish, Carla Gugino, Vanessa Hudgens, Jena Malone, Jamie Chung, and Scott Glenn. Look for a brief performance from Jon Hamm at the very end.<br/><br/>What's good about this film is, indeed, pretty good, however there are very few things I can say in this area, unfortunately. Zack Snyder is a visual extraordinaire. His slow motion shots of flying weaponry and spinning girls are a wonder to watch. Larry Fong, the cinematographer for 300 and Watchmen, does wonders with the supersaturated blacks and oranges that create a moody contrast between fantasy and reality.<br/><br/>The story is bizarrely fragment and surprisingly boring. Four 20-minute action sequences punctuate the storyline involving the asylum, which is unfortunate because that was the only one I was actually interested in. The beginning and end are worth seeing for their emotional intensity and surprising depth, however the war/samurai/dystopian/medieval fantasies are flat and plain, despite the action displayed on screen, which should be rich but isn't at all. Very often, the story sucker punches itself and doesn't every get back up.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is meant to be an action movie and yet its action sequences are the least interesting parts. Each one attempts to allude to a previous great film in its respective category, but each one is unsuccessful. Furthermore, the choreography of each fight is exactly what one might expect; there isn't a single thing that excites or creates any sort of reaction.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder has clearly stated that Sucker Punch was supposed to be 18 minutes longer with an alternate ending. The question is, do I care? The answer is yes, oddly enough. Sucker Punch has the strange potential to be a classic. After all, how many films received negative reviews upon their initial release and ended up in cult fandom?<br/><br/>One other shortcoming of this film that should absolutely be noted is the treatment of women. Although Sucker Punch wants to be a feminist movie, it actually turns out to be demeaning more than anything. Scantily clad women are sexualized throughout the entire film, and it is our job to be thrilled by the imminent danger of rape and abuse that so often happens in the asylum. It's scary to think that somebody let this kind of plot happen in this day and age. <br/><br/>Sucker Punch truly hit me hard, but not in a good way. The objectified, stiletto-wearing protagonists stumble through the entire middle third, making the good beginning and ending moot. The cast is oddly bland, but Snyder makes up for it with his impressive visuals. Overall, Sucker Punch is an experience people shouldn't enjoy. It's a post-post-modern mess that will be remembered as a geekgasm, for now at least."

But it's action packed and filled with beautiful women and some deep emotions to connect with everyone on some level. The more you get,the better the film. It blends elements of Manga, Sin City and Inception for starters and with a bleak but hopeful feeling sort of 1920-30-40 that I remember mostly from the video game Fallout, so if you were fans of any of these things Suckerpunch has something for you.<br/><br/>Visually stunning in lots of ways; from the Gothic comic book flavor of the ""reality scenes"" to the fantasy sections and then into the fantasy within the fantasy it keeps you on your toes mentally and visually.<br/><br/>A relatively simple plot is delivered in a complex way and forces you to hang on to the incredible coping mechanism Baby Doll creates in order to deal with her surroundings. From there she creates a mystical fantasy that transports you into her problem solving world that answers the problems she faces in the distant but harsh ""real"" world.<br/><br/>A fascinating ride for those who get it. If you were expecting a spoon feeding of a shoot'em up vengeance story from the cookie cutter plants in LA then you might miss the subtlety here, and be left wanting more. My 19 year son, who was with me, totally missed the point nd wanted more action and chicks with guns. I thought he fit the target demo pretty well. Go in with a open mind and connect everything to everything. It's all there if you are paying attention.<br/><br/>I loved it. It's up there on my list with Domino, Sin City, and Fight Club for getting more than you bargained for."

It's just a lot of fancy special effects and a couple of cute girls showing off their bad acting skills and campy poses straight out of Xena: Warrior Princess. It's f-ing stupid!! Half the movie takes place in imaginary world with lots of explosions and jumping around with swords, and the other half is pretty much Showgirls without the nudity. Wow I thought that was big enough but I guess not. Ten lines?! There goes trying to be concise. Thanks a lot IMDb. No wonder most of the reviews here blather on and on and are completely pretentious and unreadable. There just isn't ten lines worth of review in this movie!"
"phaedrav","1","30","65","26 March 2011"," Sucker Punch is for Suckers
","Sucker Punch is a pathetic attempt by over the hill producers at a cash grab by throwing every cliché that hooked them as kids into a random hodgepodge with no pretence of connecting them to make any sense or reason. They even throw in a gratuitous steam punk reference, because they think that's still cool. It could have been another Heavy Metal for the Zoomer generation if they'd bothered to pay for a soundtrack. Instead they throw in covers of tired old hits, like K-Tel records did to squeeze every penny out. They don't even budget a costume change for each number.<br/><br/>They get everything wrong, not by trying, just from not even caring. Admittedly this makes it one of the good kind of bad movies. A few of the ideas they steal could have been cute on their own, like flint and steel in a dragon's throat. And the monorail to Jupiter could have been funny except they put regular tracks on what was otherwise an obvious monorail, and the planet didn't work.<br/><br/>Clearly set in 1950's New York, no wait 1800s Paris, or is it 1970s Germany? When did flappers use photocopiers and Japanese Gundams to fight dragons to escape polyester suited pimps? Dream sequences aren't sufficient excuse for this. At least there's no way to pick on continuity errors when the whole movie is one big continuity error.<br/><br/>It's wrong that it's socially acceptable to go out in public to see a movie based on a comic book when you wouldn't be caught dead reading a comic book on the bus. Only watch this movie at home, secretly, with a riftrax MST3k style running commentary. Better, re-read Tank Girl while watching it again instead."

","With its rustic-futuristic visuals, synergic use of classic rock music, overt sexuality, and dreamlike action sequences, ""Sucker Punch"" feels like a live action homage to 1981's ""Heavy Metal"" with a heaping helping of ""Matrix"" folded in for good measure. Excellent, quirky performances from a bevy of skilled young actresses serve to enhance the idiosyncratic nature of this film.<br/><br/>From its atmospheric use of color to its smallest detail (think a snowflake melting on an eyelash), ""Sucker Punch"" is a visual feast. The movie sounds great, too.

","First, like many others, I love the story, fight scenes, cinematography, and of course the babes.<br/><br/>Second, I read only one other reviewer that actually understood the story fully. I don't say this to feel superior. I would not have seen through the many layers when I was younger and it took several viewing to pick up on all of it You may agree or disagree but watch it again after you read this...<br/><br/>The story was entirely about Sweet Pea and Babydoll only existed as a figment of Sweet Pea's imagination or as an alter-ego. Remember I asked you to watch it again.<br/><br/>Watch how the movie literally opens...it's a stage. Sweet Pea is narrating. When Babydoll enters the ""theater"" in the asylum, Sweet Pea is on stage dressed as Babydoll, and acting out being lobotomized. Toward the end, Dr. Gorski mentions that she accidentally killed her sister in a fit...Sweet Pea certainly had a ""fit"" when Rocket was killed and who else would they blame it on?<br/><br/>There are so many clues throughout the movie but finally at the end it is blatantly obvious. Babydoll was introduced as being ""for"" the High Roller and she must attain her freedom before she meets him. Of course it is revealed that the High Roller is the doctor who performs the lobotomy. You might not want to hear it but Sweet Pea was lobotomized and that was her escape. As she is getting on the bus, she sees the boy who was the English soldier from the WWI fight scene board the bus and her Angel or ""The Wise Man (Scott Glenn) was the bus driver. Both of these characters were introduced by Babydoll who was Sweet Pea's ater-ego.<br/><br/>It is so rare to find this depth of story in an action movie. While I did not want such an ending for Sweet Pea, she fought for her freedom. When she could not find it in the literal sense, she embraced freedom of another kind.<br/><br/>It's not the classic happy ending but tell me, when is life the happy ending you imagine? You fight for what you want and when you don't get it, if you are smart enough and strong enough you make the best of what you were able to achieve through your fight. Few of us get fairy tale endings and I applaud anyone who is brave enough to continue fighting to make what they get work for them.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch certainly makes my top ten list and I have been around long enough that only one other action movie is in the top ten with it. Watch it again...and again. You may even start to question if everyone else was real... I hope this added something to it for you rather than ruin it....that is certainly not my intent."
"staff-577-378882","4","22","46","25 March 2011"," Review: Sucker Punch
","Sucker Punch is Zack Snyder's (300, Watchmen) interpretation of an Alice in Wonderland situation. Upon the death of her mother, Babydoll is locked away in an insane asylum by her vengeful, greedy stepfather. He has arranged for her to receive a lobotomy in five days. Seeing as how such a place can put a price on creating vegetables, it isn't the most comforting of facilities as Babydoll and four other young girls are constantly threatened with beatings, rape and death.<br/><br/>Babydoll resorts to finding comfort within her own mind as she drifts into a fantasy world filled with giant samurai, zombie Nazis, and even dragons as she battles through the demons she faces in the real world. Blurring the line between reality and imagination, the 5 girls hatch a plan to escape from their prison by any means and slow-motion battle necessary.<br/><br/>The most brilliant decision Snyder made in this movie is truly the opening. I'm not referring to the opening scene (which may have been the best storytelling sequence of the film), but rather the cold start involving the WB logo. As the theatre darkens and the silver screen brightens, a gritty stage is shown with the WB logo printed on a curtain. The camera slowly moves towards the stage as the curtain pulls away to reveal the opening set; Babydoll sitting in her room staring into her mirror. Finally, the camera makes its way onto the stage and we are now brought into the story. This makes a very great and obvious argument that what follows is not meant to be grounded. Even the fantastical vignettes of battle royale are still ridiculous in their own world from physics to even visuals, but that's OK: this is the theatre.<br/><br/>Still, these vignettes are nothing without plot. The series of 4 or 5 visually exciting dream battles are tied together with a weak story that these girls must find 5 items (map, fire, knife, key, secret) in order to escape from the Great Deku Tree – oh, sorry. I was confused with The Legend of Zelda. And each time they try to take one of these items or are threatened, Babydoll drifts into a dream world of sexualized violence<br/><br/>Which is where another issue arises. Its no secret that these girls are all thigh, stockings, and boots. As a man, I can appreciate that. But there really is a depressing message that seeps forth in between every action sequence and that is ""Girls, if you're about to be raped/traumatized, just go to your happy place."" It's uncomfortable to say the least. The reason this review keeps coming back to it is because the movie does too.<br/><br/>Does Sucker Punch entertain? Parts of it do. As a series of stylistic, slow-motion oozing, action filled shorts, yes. Very much so. As a film with interlacing plot-like elements? Expect less there than you already do.<br/><br/>2.5 Creepy Thin Mustaches out of 5<br/><br/>-MovieFloss.com"

","I enjoyed 300: I loved the look of it. I enjoyed Watchmen: I loved the look of it. I loved the look of The Owls of Ga'Hoole. So, on the basis of my enjoyment of Zack Snyder's back catalogue, I have been looking forward to Sucker Punch for months, although I have been getting a little worried at some of the negative comment I have been hearing. In fact, given that the only solidly positive comment I have encountered comes from someone who strikes me as having some fairly serious mental health issues, I might have been seriously concerned had I not been firmly of the opinion that I should always form my own opinions, uninfluenced by others.<br/><br/>So now I've seen it. Before I comment, let me try to synopsise the plot. On the death of her mother, 20-year-old Baby Doll's stepfather kills her sister (possibly after sexually assaulting her) frames Baby Doll and has her committed to an asylum, where we learn she is scheduled for a lobotomy in 5 days, courtesy of a seedy orderly forging head psychiatrists Carla Gugino's signature. Fortunately, the asylum also runs on another level of reality, where it is a brothel. And whenever Baby Doll dances in the brothel, she and some of the other girls are transported into yet other alternate realities, where they carry out video game-type tasks to collect artefacts which they will need in order to escape from the asylum.<br/><br/>Let me say that there is much here which is eye-catching. Let me then go on to say that this is a dreadful, rambling mess. It makes no sense, nothing which needs explaining ever gets explained, it is full of things (starting with the initial set-up) which simply defy credibility and, worst of all, it is hatefully misogynistic. I have seen that Snyder says that it actually is about empowering women. Not in the version I saw, I'm afraid. I saw women leaping about in fishnets carrying out adolescent fantasy sex-object video game activities on the third fantasy level, but on the first and second levels, they are consistently victims - in fact (and please excuse the spoiler) Baby Doll ends up lobotomised and the man responsible in the first place gets away with it.<br/><br/>Snyder must take the blame. It is his story and he co-wrote the screenplay, which comes across as the work of a 14-year-old with ADD who has skipped his Ritalin, and who has only ever read comic books. The script is awful, truly awful (in the first 5 minutes we are brought to an establishment, the sign for which indicates that it is an ""Asylum For The Mentally Insane"" - excuse me, but did I miss the other types of Insane?).<br/><br/>If you absolutely must see this, wait for it to come out on DVD - it will end up in the bargain bins very quickly. It stinks."
"campkllyrsf-1","4","29","64","25 March 2011"," Not sure what went wrong with SUCKER PUNCH
","Zack Snyder is an interesting director. I definitely think he's a very talented individual with a very good eye for the craft. 300, WATCHMEN, GUARDIANS and SUCKER PUNCH all have a very unique visual style and are all very well made films. However, SUCKER PUNCH is going to make me question anything he has a part in that involves him putting a pen to paper. <br/><br/>I love the whole idea and concept of SUCKER PUNCH. However, ideas and concepts can only go so far. SP is a story about what someone is willing to go through in order to cope with the struggles and obstacles in front of them. How sometimes you have to resort to your imagination just to pull through. And within these imaginary worlds they're able to do anything they want. I like the story, but the entire time I found myself not giving a crap. Snyder fails to do the most important thing when making a story like this, and that's bring the emotion. <br/><br/>It's not the actors' fault either. Every single person on screen brings everything they've got. Even Vanessa Hudgens is good, which feels really strange coming through my finger tips, and Jamie Chung is actually convincing. Everyone really does a fine job. Aside from action, Snyder knows how to work with actors. Unfortunately I can't say the same for being able to write characters.<br/><br/>One thing Snyder has proved in his career is that he's got an eye for action and style. Each set piece is brilliantly put together and visually stunning. Within the imagination of Baby Doll (Emily Browning) everything is amazingly surreal. It's chaotic and really the most impressive part of the entire film. The fights, whether they be gun fights, sword fights, a dragon chasing a plane or 3 girls on a train full of robots, are well choreographed and everything is shot so you can see what's going on. I do think Snyder is a little too obsessed with slo-mo and it occasionally gets to be too much. <br/><br/>What's unfortunate about all the effort and hard work that went into these brilliantly staged set pieces is that I just didn't care. Because of the nature of these scenes, being inside of an imagination, there wasn't much at stake. Characters weren't in any real danger of dying and the lack of emotion had me a bit bored despite how pretty it looked. When I was watching it I was thinking ""damn, that was cool"" but at the same time I didn't feel the urgency the characters supposedly felt. And after a while the aesthetic of the eye candy wore off and I became fairly bored. <br/><br/>I'm not sure what went wrong here. I usually dig mindless action as long as it's well presented. SUCKER PUNCH is definitely one of the best presented mindless action in years, but something stopped me from really enjoying the movie like I wanted to. It's got everything I could have asked for: Hot girls in little clothing, dragons, sword fights, gun fights, mechs, robots. Everything except emotion. I don't think it was from lack of trying either. It just felt lost somewhere, buried beneath all the ""cool"" of the movie. <br/><br/>It's hard to say whether I'd recommend SUCKER PUNCH or not. I'm leaning towards a no because from other people's reactions they didn't enjoy it as much as they hoped. It's great eye-candy, but when it's done you'll be craving something more filling. Zack Snyder I still think is a great director, but I don't think he should play around with story too much anymore. I want to see him direct something where he had no hand in the writing process and keeps the story close to the original script. I guess we'll see what happens when SUPERMAN comes out."

","I however, do not care for pretty colours.<br/><br/>I sat through this movie utterly perplexed due to the amount of plot holes and inconsistencies. It took an incredibly poor concept, mixed it with a confusing and unnecessary sub story to produce an outright mess that one would generally be reluctant to call ""film"". Of course, the absence of a story was overshadowed to most of the viewers by scantily clad women and dream-like fighting scenes.<br/><br/>This, I must say, is absolutely the most gratuitous movie ever made. The plot revolved around a group of women, institutionalized, who find themselves in a concocted dream-within-a-dream world for reasons irrelevant to anything. The task they find themselves attempting to accomplish is using their feminine cunning and guile to entice the men in the institute so that they can steal a number of menial items to grant their escape. The horrendous writing was not a distracting element to others as there was a plethora of scandalous women running around with guns and causing explosions. The budget of this film was spent solely on special effects and did not, apparently, leave any room for pants for the women to wear.<br/><br/>Though I thoroughly detested 'Sucker Punch' from beginning to end, it became apparent to me that the rest of the theatre actually found themselves enjoying it.<br/><br/>So I suppose, if you are looking for some late night, 14A, fun filled with pretty colours, women, guns, and explosions, but do not care for plot, respect towards women, intelligence, and good writing or direction, this is the movie for you!"

So I was expecting to see a good action movie with a decent story.<br/><br/>Boy was I for sure sucker punched right in the muncher after 10 minutes watching this movie! Although it started as a promising film, it kind of felt like the director went: ""you know what? screw the plot, let's just make this eye candy and CGI, bring me some samurais- BAM!!! right in the face! ha ha ha!"" So much for the story and characters, I couldn't care less about what happened to them throughout the movie! It felt like kill bill met charlies angels, mixed with some Call of Duty topped with German zombies, served in a dragon skull by a evil robot. Did they forget to add any boyish fetish?! I rated this with 2 stars because of the CGI, which are pretty good.

","Sucker Punch is a knockout. A visual masterpiece with enough story and acting to make it feel substantial. If you combine Heavy Metal, Suspiria, Tron, Kill Bill, Big Trouble in Little China, along with the visual flair of 300, you end up here. To call this film psychedelic is to make the understatement of the year. Zack Snyder definitely continues to improve as a filmmaker (even if Dawn of the Dead is just about perfect). The characterization were engaging and I enjoyed the multi-layered reality, especially the transition to the higher-level fantasies. Gets a 10 from me, and I hope this trend toward intellectually stimulating special effects extravaganzas continues. I didn't realize I'd enjoy the fantasy imagery as much as I did. Oh, and the soundtrack is just perfect. Perfect."

"jasjessen-11-961493","2","23","50","27 March 2011"," Where Do I Even Begin...
","Let me start out by saying that 300 was great. Intense, graphic novel style that was beautiful and entertaining to watch. Zack Snyder's Watchmen was an amazing movie that really developed the characters while still retaining a great plot structure and fantastic visuals and directing style. Sucker Punch, however, fails to appeal to anything other than those looking for scantily clad teenage girls moping with the occasional linear CGI cut scene. <br/><br/>So why does Zack Synder fail so poorly? First of all I honestly think he cannot write his screenplays. Both 300 and Watchmen were not written by him. He also had a series of graphic novels to look at to help develop and hone in on the stylistic portions of the movie. Sucker Punch was written by yours truly, Zack Snyder. The story is ill conceived, predictable, and leaves nothing to the imagination. <br/><br/>The biggest problem of the entire movie is the soundtrack. The film totes remakes of 90s classics all set in a more melodramatic fashion. This is fine, but the soundtracks picked for each individual scene describes exactly how the central character at that point in time is ""feeling."" On top of this the scenes have numerous slow motion techniques and they also drop all in scene audio. All you can hear is the soundtrack playing. The end result is a movie that feels more like a long and boring music video. A hint for Zack Snyder; good movies do not pick random hits, they usually develop their own orchestral track. And when you have a $150 budget, I think find room to do that. <br/><br/>Besides this, the CGI scenes are all rather cliché and boring. Baby Doll must get item X which leads to CGI scene X. They are all linear and leave the viewer wondering when the scene will finally end. Worst of all the viewer realizes that they must watch a numbered total of these same exact linear scenes that all resemble video games or past great movies. In other words, the scenes basically stole from other popular fictional universes. <br/><br/>If you are not an avid fan of anime, or 12 years old, then do yourself a favor and take a pass on this movie."

So in summary CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP. Luckily only 40 odd minutes of my life wasted (and trust me my life ain't all that!),unlike the poor cast of this movie who have wasted their talents by signing up for this.

"carlkevad","7","12","23","11 June 2011"," I'd like to punch all those suckers who say that ""Sucker Punch"" sucks.
","Zack Snyder directs this very surreal film about girls in the Lennox mental institution for the criminally insane. Sucker Punch"" stars Emily Browning as Baby Doll, a supposedly 20 year-old girl whose mother, after her death, writes in her testament that all of her property would go to her two daughters. Baby's evil stepfather is outraged and on one faithful night, beats the crap out of Baby's sister, killing her. Baby witnesses this, grabs a gun, and shoots her stepfather. He lives and sends Baby Doll to the Lennox mental institution for the criminally insane. That's when the movie really begins.<br/><br/>Upon arrival to Lennox, she meets with fellow inmates Rocket, Sweet Pea, Blondie, and Amber. All you Vanessa Hudgens fans, Blondie is played by her. It is then that we come to understand that Lennox isn't a mental institution, more of a bordel. We also meet Carla Gugino as Dr. Vera Gorski, the coreographer"" of the girls' dances, which they perform to men who eagerly expect so. Baby Doll befriends her fellow inmates and while performing for the first time, comes up with a plan to escape the facility. That's when all the crazy action sequences begin in the film, which is contrary to popular belief, actually pretty good.<br/><br/>Most critics have panned this film. Richard Roeper gave it a D and it's received a 22% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. That's just 2 percent higher than what the site gave to Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,"" so you know Sucker Punch"" should be bad. But movie critics aren't always to be trusted, and as much as I respect them, I've gotta say that I believe they're horribly wrong to rate Sucker Punch"" negatively. I've read reviews for the film and most of them say that the film never explains what the crazy action sequences are about. It actually does, but nobody ever pays attention to what's going on in an action film, and then afterwards they complain why they didn't understand anything that was going on.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil anything, so I'd rather have that you go out, see the movie, pay attention throughout the film, and then tell me whether you got it or not. I certainly did, or if the Snyder meant something else, then I didn't. Whatever I got, however, was enough to make me interested in the movie throughout.<br/><br/>I think that the reason why many didn't pay attention throughout the movie, was because it was directed by a man who is primarily known for directing mindless"" action flicks such as 300,"" which is actually a very good movie. In 300,"" Snyder catches our (or at least mine) attention with gorgeous visuals, here he does the same. All the action sequences are masterfully choreographed and you always know where the enemy is, and the protagonists are.<br/><br/>That said the movie does have its flaws. The dialogue is often a bit too corny, the film was perhaps a bit too stylistic, and it is definitely not to be compared with Snyder's masterful previous work. But in overall, Sucker Punch"" is whether you get it or not, an undeniable visual treat with a jaw-droppingly epic soundtrack, and if any of you dare say that it just looks like a video game, I'll reply: Well, I like video games.""<br/><br/>Rating: 3/4"

A world where she and her friends; Sweet Pea (Abby Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), & Amber (Jamie Chung) kicks asses of Samurai-robot warriors, clock works, dragons, gores and robots from WWI to dragon lairs. And oh, the action sequence is AMAZING & the CGI effects was epic. This Zac Snyder film will blow your mind away with an incredible story line. So to make this long story short, GREAT MOVIE! I recommend you to watch this."
"josef-6","10","12","23","26 March 2011"," My 11-year old twin sons loved it
","Most of the movie took place inside the fantasy world minds of young women committed to a mental hospital. There was a fantasy world inside the fantasy world(kind of like a play within a play). The film dealt with a very mature subject (molestion) without actually showing any disturbing scenes to gross you out (unlike the TV show Criminal Minds for example). The young women fought their demons in a video game-like fantasy world as a kind of out of body experience. Killing dragons and Nazis in the fantasy was slaying their own personal monsters in their minds. The plot was original and unique. The actresses played their roles to perfection and Scott Glenn was excellent. I believe in guardian angels and have worked with patients who have had out of body experiences so the movie fit well into my personal belief system. It was entertaining, exciting, and surprising. My sons ""got"" it and liked it."

","In the first 30 minutes. there were terrifying scenes when the star is threatened with rape, watches her sister threatened with incest, accidentally murders her sister, is put in a house of prostitution, and almost given a lobotomy with a spike. Add to that step-father paying a sleazy mental institution guard to institutionalize the step-daughter and give her a lobotomy so she can't make a statement against him. The doctors and guards are watching the girls in the institution for their arousal. It's all presented in a dark and frightening way.<br/><br/>From the ads it looked like X-men meets power-puff girls. As my sons said, ""hot girls with guns."" I re-looked at the trailer I saw after the movie and it looks like your typical shoot-em-up. The reviews imply that the star goes into a fantasy world where she and her friends are like action heroes. It so wasn't that!!!!! I'd call it a psycho-sexual thriller.

","I've read a lot of bad reviews on this film but feel that perhaps people are missing the point.<br/><br/>Yes- the movie is chaotic and confusing. It's difficult to know what if any of this film is set in the real world or if it's all a schoolgirl's paranoiac fantasies. But I think that's the whole purpose of the movie.<br/><br/>We don't know and it's quite a ride. Is her stepfather abusive? Is her sister? alive or dead? Is she in an institution for juvenile delinquent girls, a French finishing school for rich young debs, a child brothel in Eastern Europe, an American mental asylum or none of the above.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter. We're looking at the workings of an unbalanced mind or minds and it's graphically, and visually stunning, with a soundtrack to boot- and that's the beauty of it. Oh - and girls can do anything.<br/><br/>Just enjoy."
"dalton0804","8","8","14","20 April 2011"," Surprisingly awesome
","I think Zack Synder must suffer from ADHD judging by this film, and thats not a bad thing. I've been a fan of his since Dawn of the dead, not a fan boy but I like his style over substance filmmaking, he's certainly better and more consistent then a lot of other big budget directors out there.<br/><br/>Right from the start we are in the familiar Snyder-isms of CGI and slow motion. Complaints about the lack of story are valid but then that's not the point of this film. Its purely a visual experience and as such it delivers in spades.<br/><br/>Coupled with the sheer beauty of Emily Browning's eyes and game performances from all involved, this is great, not perfect, summer entertainment. I think that Synder continues to grow and develop as a filmmaker, and I look forward to his Superman film."
"zero_destiny_0","7","8","14","31 March 2011"," Somewhat Refreshing
","Zach Snyder has continuously wowed his audience with extremely fast-paced action scenes coupled with impressive camera angles and theatrical slow motion. The stories he works with are simple, relying heavily on action and intrigue. It is no different here.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is in fact an enjoyable movie with highly gratifying action and a fitting soundtrack. Music goes on and on, one new piece about every ten minutes or less. It honestly could be said that this movie is a long music video. All the special effects, at least concerning the swarms of enemies, are surreal; they don't look too realistic, but then again, they are not supposed to. Baby Doll's imaginary world is comprised totally of nightmarish villains almost or entirely lack humanity. Let is be noted they do not look cheap or fake, either. Those who say the action scenes have no connection omit the fact Baby Doll is envisioning a world, any world, where she controls the deadliest of situations. She is traumatized, essentially locked up. It not so much the images but the situation as a whole and the insanity she is imagining.<br/><br/>The storyline is simple once again. However, it comes with an end that is in fact refreshing to see and makes the movie worthwhile. The acting, when not focused on stalwart fighting, is good, even well done. However, I can't say the movie connects very well on all ends. It has little do with the beginning; while the movie makes sense, it seems derailed from what it presented its own plot to be.<br/><br/>If one is looking for a movie that is simple, innovative, philosophical and makes total sense, don't see this one. If you're looking for a simple to complex, action-filled, adrenaline-pumping movie with a surprise, do go see this movie. It's not the best, but I for one enjoyed it immensely."
"scottwallvashon","1","22","48","28 March 2011"," A Film Designed to Punish its Audience
","After ten minutes of this film, I walked out. I had some doubt about  this decision until I read on ComicBookMovie.com how the  writer/director Zack Snyder explains the meaning of the title:   ""I think sucker punch sums it up for me. Look, literally it's like a  mechanism in the film that kind of brings us back into reality I think.  But I think on the other hand, because the movie is a slight indictment   it talks about geek culture and pop culture, it talks about the why  of the action cinema and stuff of that nature  it's also a sucker  punch because I kind of designed it that you go to this movie for  entertainment and you get a little bit f*cked up by it, hopefully.  (http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/BrentSprecher/news/?a=33931)""  In other words, the whole point of the film is to punish people like me  who go to see action films.   He goes on to compare action films to brothels and to compare those of  us who watch them to leering men who visit brothels. This makes me very  angry. If I had known about this as I walked out of the movie, I would  also have asked for my money back. Maybe I still will ask for my money  back. Maybe I will go back to the theater with my ticket and my receipt  and demand my admission fee."
"Eternality","5","20","43","23 March 2011"," Snyder may have returned to his signature filmmaking style that characterized 300 and Watchmen, but not in the hardcore fashion that we have expected him to deliver.
","Zack Snyder, who is popular for his ultraviolent, over-stylized films such as 300 (2007) and Watchmen (2009), delivers a new motion picture that marks a return to his roots as a badass filmmaker this side of Tarantino. But a quick look at the consumer rating for Sucker Punch is likely to leave fanboys considerably disappointed. After all, a PG-rated Snyder film is as puzzling as it is ironic. Please ignore the anomaly that is his last film, a family-friendly animated outing called Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole (2010), which is Snyder taking a breather rather than letting out aggressive steam.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch, with its all-babes cast, targets male youths who are also video gaming geeks. The story, which is so minimalistic that it lives up to the first four letters of the film's title, tells of a teenage girl called Baby Doll (Emily Browning) who is sent to a mental institution by her immoral stepfather. There she envisions a plan to escape the facility while retreating into the reality of her mind, which by the way is every geek's wet dream. With the help of four other hot babes in the institution, Baby Doll attempts to free herself from her physical prison with guidance and clues from her mental mentor, the Wise Man (Scott Glenn).<br/><br/>Opting for all style does not always guarantee substance. Weak characterizations plague Sucker Punch, whose lead cast are nothing more than eye candy, and their motivations not well-developed. Viewers are unlikely to care whether they live or die, or about the sacrifices they have made for each other, because their characters are as paper-thin as the skimpy outfits they wear. The acting, however, is surprisingly decent for a film whose emphasis is overwhelmingly on the spectacle of sight and sound, of which it has too much in abundance.<br/><br/>The action is stylized and invigorating, at least in the four or five 7- 10 minute interludes that break the narrative structure into several progressive parts. Very much a MMORPG blown up onto the big screen during these interludes, Sucker Punch borrows heavily from elements of popular culture such as The Matrix (1999) and Kill Bill (2003) to even games like Metal Slug in the mid-nineties. Not since Tank Girl (1995), a brainless, zany, sci-fi action comedy that pits one girl (and her tank) against an evil mega-corporation has a film been so reliant on girl firepower to light up the screen.<br/><br/>Loud, brash, and I daresay at times entertaining, Sucker Punch is unfortunately soft on violence and sex, which apart from the non- existent plot, is the other main issue here. Where is the blood and gore? Where is the nudity? There is not even a hint of lesbianism, or any other forms of frank sexuality. Not that these are necessary, but a Snyder film is still a Snyder film. He may have returned to his signature filmmaking style that characterized 300 and Watchmen, but not in the hardcore fashion that we have expected him to deliverand one more thing, please pack a pair of earplugs to go with your popcorn, unless you want to get your eardrums sucker punched.<br/><br/>GRADE: C- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved."

","Once I saw a movie that has a lot of action, comedy moments, intrigue, suspense, and finally made me cry. Cinematography was great, the acting was superb, it was ingenious, clever and finally I thought, if there's a movie that deserves a 10, this one is.<br/><br/>Well, exactly the opposite happened to me while watching this movie. I felt, a) bored, since the story goes nowhere, if there is any story at all. b) claustrophobia, since there are not a single take filmed on any actual location, everything is computer-generated. Cyberpunk genre going wrong. c) depressed, what the heck do people who liked this movie have on their heads? and started to think that the human race is inevitably going to be destroyed in a very stupid way... with overproduced and ridiculously unreal FX. d) In Spanish, we have a concept called ""vergüenza ajena"", it's when you feel embarrassed for what someone else did, or does. Well, this was my feeling, I felt so sorry for the guy who did this movie, I think he surely put an effort to do this, and to get what? a candidate to ""worst movie ever""? poor guy, he might be so depressed. Or possibly, Zack Snyder is a villain who wants to take revenge on humanity by doing unwatchable movies, and his point was to actually do a horrible movie.<br/><br/>There's no point at all on trying to find any sense on the girl blowing up Nazis while riding a mecha, or fighting with characters taken from Mortal Kombat, although those were the better parts of the movie. The mustache whorehouse owner character is lame, mono-dimensional and retarded. The scene where the girl dies, and tells the other girl ""tell mom that I love her"" was, for me, the bottom. A always repeating clichè, trying to ineffectively put some drama in a story where there's no place for drama at all.<br/><br/>And just to end it, the cherry upon the pie, everything was a dream, or something, but nothing of what you spent two irrecoverable hours of your life was real. Just horrible.<br/><br/>I'm starting to think that this Mr. Snyder is going to be the next Shyamalan, worst director ever. I mean, he directed 300, what would you expect?! Spend some time with your family, read a book, learn to cook something, or watch the plants growing, but for god's sake, do NOT watch this movie under any circumstances; except if you are a masochist, and want to have one of the worst cinematic experiences of your life."

Snyder, the last blond super-heroine was Shera princess of power.... lets keep it that way. it was a pathetic attempt at a more teenage middle to upper class demographic. this movie was aimed at the Bieber- High School musical demographic, which figures why he used Vanessa Hudgens in the movie. The silly attempt at the school girl outfit only did the movie worse, forgetting a very basic and first rule about The Japanese Schoolgirl Cos play- I-N-N-O-C-E-N-C-E..! Sticking your title character with high heels and blond hair... fail<br/><br/>2. Which brings me to number two... we are supposed to FEEL the realism of the movie. Why choose a lead character who remains expressionless throughout the entire movie from obvious bot-ox and lip injections... am supposed to feel the 1950's edo era japan with that???<br/><br/>3. Not to be too harsh but anyone watching this movie, just wait for the DVD, get it from redbox and fast forward it to the 25.00 minute mark and start watching it from there.

"mileshall77","2","19","41","27 March 2011"," Movie patrons ""suckered"" into seeing ""Sucker Punch""?
","""Sucker Punch"" could have almost been a career-ender for all the talent involved in making this well shot but poorly written film. It's the perfect example of when bad writers get a hold of a good director and do too many mind altering narcotics. The talent brought to the table as far as CGI, direction and even mild to potentially promising acting all couldn't have saved this film.<br/><br/>If the media blitz for Sucker Punch wouldn't have been as good as they were, this film would have been a catastrophic loss and packed the bags for a few folks tagged to this film who wouldn't have the means to survive it. Unfortunately, Sucker Punch is a $10 script with a $10 million dollar backing sadly. The previews did what they could to sell the little action in the film, but I don't see it doing well in retail sales once the pitch forking reviewers and those unlucky souls that saw the film get done stringing it up in town square.<br/><br/>I feel badly for the actresses, stunt coordinators and even the director that put a lot of hard labored attention to detail into the film that was all built on a poorly written script. The plot transitioned horribly from reality to the fantasy realm and could have been done simpler and easier with just a bit more thought about how they were going to go about it. The other was era issues. The era originally started was that of maybe the 50's. Then in the fantasies, we are hit with a modern arsenal of weaponry and then thrown back into medieval weaponry and then forwarded into robots. And I get it, it's a fantasy so anything is possible. But if it's the 50's, should a cute girl in a sexy cosplay outfit be holding a laser sighted auto magazine AR15 with a silencer? Just saying, stay within a realm of illusion. If you are going to jump all over the place with it, make it within a usable and believable setting.<br/><br/>The direction I would have gone in writing the films was to pull the characters into a dream world and stay in that world until completion of the film and only hint back to the original reality based one. Movies that do an alternate realm of reality really tread lightly when doing this to make it seamless. You see this in well written fantasy sci-fi like The Matrix, Tron... hell, even those dumb ass Narnia films can pull it off.<br/><br/>Lastly, the dialogue and setups in the reality world were just too damn long and drawn out. You sit there for almost an hour before anything good really happens. I am sorry, it just took too damn long to get too damn little CGI payout. The music was all just re-hashed out music from the 90's that for some reason, ended up in a 50's genre movie. I did love the fighting scenes and choreography, which is what kept me from ripping it apart fully. The film is shot in perfect light, great use of shading for characters and amazing setup for the backgrounds of the fight scenes but the film plot is just worthless. Would have made a great films though. Pity, I had high hopes for this one.<br/><br/>Sadly, ""Sucker Punch"" is unfortunately a huge let down as a big screen sizzler. It would do best as a rental but not a purchasable DVD until it hit the $2.99 bin. Maybe they should have tried to make a ""300"" Part 2 or something and saved everyone's time as that was what folks were expecting, in all honesty. Maybe next time, maybe next time. Till then, will you be a ""sucker"" and see this film ???"

"wardj-98216","8","7","12","10 April 2016"," Criminally underrated, visual masterpiece
","When I decided to watch this film I had pretty low expectations due to the battering it received from most critics. However I was I fan of director Zack Snyder's work and this film enticed me quite a bit so I decided to finally check it out after many years.<br/><br/>And wow, this film rocks!!! And here's why:<br/><br/>The plot follows a girl known only as Babydoll who due to some unfortunate circumstances, has been sent to a institution for the mentally ill. We soon discover she is there to be lobotomized (made brain dead) in five days time. To cope with her impending doom, Babydoll imagines that the mental hospital is a completely different place, a brothel in fact, filled with many interesting people. One thing leads to another and Babydoll soon discovers that to escape this place, she must acquire five items which she does by entering various types of imagination worlds such as the trenches of WW1 or a medieval castle all while kicking some major ass in the process to hopefully eventually gain freedom.<br/><br/>The cast of this film contains some real knockouts for the male audience including Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish and Jamie Chung who are all freaking gorgeous and certainly believable as female bad asses. However, the cast member who truly shines in this film is Oscar Issac who plays Blue, the owner of the brothel. Isaacs performance was absolutely fantastic as he expertly pulls off a man who genuinely thinks he in the right but is really a cold blooded psycho.<br/><br/>The most visually appealing part of this film (apart from the female cast of course) was the action. Seeing as this was helmed by Mr Snyder, I expected to go 'wow' to some of the action scenes, and I certainly did. There are many varied action scenes in this film that boast excellent camera-work, stunts, effects, music and just overall badassery and the WW1 and train scene in particular p, had me smiling the whole way through.<br/><br/>Speaking of the score, it's absolutely mesmerizing, featuring songs such as Sweet dreams and Army of me to set a grungy dire atmosphere really, really well. One thing to note with this film's soundtrack is that most of the songs featured, are actually covered by cast members including Emily Browning and Oscar Isaac which I found really admirable.<br/><br/>Now I could see how someone could dislike this film due to its sometimes incoherent storyline and sometimes lazy dialog and don't get me wrong this film isn't perfect or anything but to me, I had a genuinely fun time seeing these characters go on a visually stunning and very unique adventure. If I had to sum up this film in one sentence, it would be this. Sucker punch is a blend of mis matched action sequences tied together with a unique storyline and plenty of hot chicks. If that sounds like something you would like to see then I strongly recommend you watch this film asap and give it the attention and appreciation that it deserves."
"MovieEnthusiast13","8","7","12","3 April 2011"," ""Snyder tells a serious story of a girl dealing with her own mind in a way of accepting her fate through dark scenarios and epic battle scenes.""
","Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch is unlike anything you will have ever seen before. Despite similarities to Inception, Kill Bill, Alice in Wonderland and about a dozen other action movies it truly is a new type of story. Snyder tells a serious story of a girl dealing with her own mind in a way of accepting her fate through dark scenarios and epic battle scenes. The cinematography is great and the story is put together with thought.<br/><br/>The film opens with a brilliant sequence portraying the protagonist's situation. Her mother has died and she and her younger sister are left in the care of another man. The stepfather comes close to abusing the daughters, but the protagonist fights back, however, in the confusion her little sister dies. The protagonist is than sent to a mental institution and is arranged to be lobotomized in five days time.<br/><br/>To deal with the pain and preparing herself for what is to come she retreats into the solace of her own mind. She imagines that the institution is an orphanage, and that the orderly is the villainous man who runs the show. When I say show I mean a real show, as the orphanage is a cover for the man's real intentions. Her and some of the other dancers join together to try and escape. During each stage of the escape, for example stealing a map or a knife, the protagonist imagines herself and the other girls in a fantastical world assigned with the task to capture objectives. This includes a scene on an enormous battlefield where the girls must cross no man's land and steal a map from the enemy and another scene in which the girls have to stop a bomb on a train in a futuristic world on a distant planet.<br/><br/>Each of these sequences allow for Snyder and his team to display the special effects they are known for from such movies as 300 and Watchmen. The effects are great and certain sequences really made me wish I could've seen this movie in IMAX. The direction by Zach Snyder is great. He captures the large battle scenes with terrific imagery, and each of the levels of her imagination contains a different sort of color contrast on screen. Snyder is also great at scenes contained in a smaller environment, focusing on aspects such as a spinning button on the floor or a smashed light. He also directed a magnificent opening scene, which despite the lack of dialogue, is very powerful.<br/><br/>The acting and storyline are also good. The leading girls are never given real names, they are simply called Baby Doll (Emily Browning), Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Amber (Jamie Chung) and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens). All of these girls give solid performances, perhaps the weakest being Vanessa Hudgens, or Jamie Chung. The story is well thought out, for example how the effects of the real world carry through to her imagination.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is definitely Zach Snyder's best film yet, while it does have some problems, it maintains a high quality of film making. That being said, it still isn't a movie for everyone. It discusses serious themes through the gray interpretation of the world, but most of the film is set in the fantastical worlds of Baby Doll's imagination, making nothing impossible. Some of the scenes won't be for everybody, but this is a movie worth seeing, especially in theaters."
"filmmakerartist1","1","10","19","29 January 2012"," The world's most expensive music video and little else.
","For anyone familiar with Zack Snyder, this movie is no surprise. He earned the right to make this by turning an old graphic novel, 300, into a money making machine and filming the once impossible to film Watchmen. Now, here he is with his own original concept and it's one for the ages. While the overall concept, in theory, isn't a terrible one, it's the execution that drives me nuts as it's filled with every imaginable cliché and the whole film is, in essence, one long music video. In between the much touted fantasy sequences, we have a cast of heavily made up, overly polished young women moping around a sanitarium without much to do or say although they would look more at home in a brothel. Style over anything resembling substance is the order of the day here. The fantasy sequences play in a way that kept making me think ""this is what a 12 year old with $80 million would make"" Giant samurai with Gatling guns, fire breathing dragons and slow-mo closeups of girls jumping with guns and swords. All bombast flash and no heart is what best sums up these scenes and this movie."

","Watching Sucker Punch put me in mind of a great old Twilight Zone episode A Stop At Willoughby. Young Emily Browning has been committed to an asylum where apparently all the patients are young and nubile women who are played by Vanessa Hudgens, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, and Jane Chang. There seems to be a good reason for that as these women have to dance alluring dances and perform other services for high rolling customers. A way for the asylum to make some money.<br/><br/>Like James Daly in the Twilight Zone episode who was a modern businessman under great job pressure looking for an escape, these women want to escape as well. He found an exit in an unscheduled stop in a town called Willoughby which looks like a set from The Music Man. The girls also want an escape into life beyond the walls of this place they're trapped in.<br/><br/>More I can't say lest I divulge the secret of the plot. But Browning and Daly both want out of the life they're trapped in and each finds a similar solution. Scott Glenn has a mysterious and unique role similar to the train conductor in the Twilight Zone episode.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch because a lot of it takes place in the imagination has a great show of special effects virtuosity. If you're not terribly concerned about story and plot as I am, this is the film for you. The girls are lovely to look at also and they have great fighting skills or their stunt doubles do."

This movie should just be called Sucker, for those duped into seeing this movie.<br/><br/>There was barely a plot and no character development, I didn't care if they succeeded or not. All of the cgi fight sequences made no sense nor relevance to anything they were trying to accomplish nor were they revolutionary by any means. I have seen it all before in much better executed formats and films. It was simply put, empty and soulless. The fluff of eye candy tried to mask an underdeveloped storyline, but movie goers are not stupid and I totally called his bluff.<br/><br/>I am so disappointed because I was really excited for this movie and the trailer totally mislead me into thinking I was going to see something well made...<br/><br/>And another thing, the whole woman empowerment was utter b.s.

Yeah, women will be empowered by burlesque whores dancing while they fantasize into an anime style fight scene revealing both cleavage and pantie shots.

I thought it was empowering. <br/><br/>It depicts the journey of a young girl through guilt, pain and loss through the medium of an alternate reality. This metaphor in which the characters live is a cabaret style brothel. The girls fight for freedom and dignity in a situation that so harshly strips them of it. <br/><br/>I especially loved the action scenes within this.

","When I go to see a movie I usually avoid reading any reviews beforehand. So after I left the theater I couldn't believe how low this movie was scoring on some of these ""well respected"" critics sites. As a fan of most films I've come to understand that critics tend to either love a movie like this or hate it but it seems that it was mostly hatred that I was seeing. To me this film was a great original idea that you have to see more then once to completely enjoy this great piece or work that Zach Snyder has made.<br/><br/>When a movie can stick everything from samurai's, nazi zombies, dragons and more into a plot then it has already accomplished something. However beyond the CGI that is mostly back round to the plot. The plot is a little complicated but that's a good thing since it makes you think.<br/><br/>One of the great things about this movie is that it keeps you guessing and doesn't give up until the credits start rolling. The performances from this young cast is spectacular, Emily Browning's role in particular is more difficult then it seems but she accomplishes it in a great way.<br/><br/>I don't understand why this movie was so denounced by critics and I don't really care to tell you the truth because it's viewers like you and me that know what we like to watch and what kind movies are entertaining.

","I for one loved this movie.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people out there saw it as immature and pandering to the virgin 15 year old boy demographic but u need to see past that and recognize the symbolism of it all.<br/><br/>This movie is a perfect example of how reality is determined by perception. ""Everything you see or hear or experience in any way at all is specific to you. You create a universe by perceiving it, so everything in the universe you perceive is specific to you."" – Douglas Adams<br/><br/>You have to realize that the whole movie is just a recap of her time in the asylum twisted by the way she perceived it. The personification of herself as this objectified girl whored out to Bleu is because that's the way she's treated by her step-father and the orderlies. Think about it: in the beginning and end of the film Bleu is just some loser orderly that runs the place from the back door where as in her dream world he becomes the ""Boss"" because baby-doll saw him as the man in charge with the doctor completely under his thumb. He's the one deciding her fate and the one she must ultimately overcome to escape her subjugation. There are so many examples of this throughout the entire movie but you need to look past the short schoolgirl outfits and fishnet stockings.<br/><br/>Another interesting thing I saw was how baby-doll identified her struggles by the imaginary worlds she went to overcome them. <br/><br/>The first one is when she needs to find the strength required to face an overwhelming world she's dropped into. The old wise man being the source of that inner strength giving her all the ""weapons"" she needs to fight would be the doctor trying to help her in the therapy sessions or some long lost father figure (maybe her father who was loving and supportive before he was lost to her giving her the confidence she needs to overcome) and the demons themselves seeming so dauntingly powerful that they appear as 10 foot tall demon samurai warriors.<br/><br/>After that we go to the German trenches where she's joined by her 4 cohorts. Funny how when she needs to find the strength of a leader she imagines a world where she has to somehow lead these women into battle against a horde of undead Nazi soldiers.<br/><br/>Anyway, probably going to run out of room here soon so I'll just say this; This is the type of movie Hollywood needs to keep making. Its visually stunning while surprisingly deep and thought out. And to those who didn't get it or hate it, that's fine just watch something else and enjoy."
"eric262003","8","6","10","2 July 2012"," Convincing Enough To Watch Again
","""Sucker Punch"" is very likely to have a massive fan following in the near future. It's truly one of those movie that people would flock to just to watch it over again a second time or maybe more. And I'm convinced that it is already making a splash at the video stores everywhere. Right off the bat I was very impressed by the special effects (I am an impresario for the special and visual effects in any film I see). It's one of those movies where you just kick back and enjoy the movie without a care of how good or bad your day was. Don't go into this movie trying to decipher and dissect every implausible theories you have in mind or question if this movie makes any sense or not. Such movies are not customized to gather a cornucopia of questions. ""Sucker Punch"" is designed for entertainment purposes only, not trivialize its relevance and whatnot. I was saddened when they killed off one of my favorite characters, but hey I won't lose sleep over that.<br/><br/>The fantasy scenes were absolutely mesmerizing. I hope a sequel is in the future as I hope Babydoll and company make a return soon. I want our leading protagonist to inflict revenge on her adversaries. I have more questions about the characters and plus the visuals are vibrantly tantalizing. In addition to that I found the soundtrack to be very sublime as it blends in nicely with the scenes. The female heroes during their battles is palpitating to watch and it feels like you're watching ""The Matrix"" fights scenes, so kudos goes to the choreographers for their skillful training in the battle scenes. Through multiple viewings it gets more fun to watch. It's great fun to watch, bring a few friends over, get out your favorite snacks and enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>I'm not a hater for predictable movies, sure there are a lot of whiners out there that cry about movies being too predictable, but not this film critic. As long as it carries me through the whole show, then I'm all satisfied. If they ever make a sequel I hope there will be further development in the warden's(Oscar Isaac from ""Drive"") and the evil Stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) who poisoned the mother. I also want more exciting fantasy scenes and what the old meanie is doing with his gains, plus more emphasis on the dance teacher (Carla Gugino), I hope Babydoll (Emily Browning) gets further gain by taking this antagonist out of the equation. And it would be great to see the other inmates (Jena Malone, Jamie Chung, Vanessa Hudgens and Abbie Cornish) too get better character exposure. too. An awesome movie, one must not overlook."

","I typically don't like big budget action/CGI movies - Transformers comes to mind - though I did like The Matrix (don't we all?). In fact, most movies I like are the dark, depressing, thoughtful kind (think Children of Men, Mulholland Drive, A Clockwork Orange). So this one was a surprise.<br/><br/>In your typical movie, it is the struggles and challenges that the characters face that make you want to keep watching. You want to see how they solve their problems, how they grow and change, and what becomes of them. Early in the movie, we are shown that the entire thing is a hallucination - it doesn't matter what happens to her, because shes about to get a lobotomy. This takes away that sense, and actually helps the movie be what it needs to be. I was entirely engaged in this movie not because I cared about the characters, but because of the sheer rate of awesome being poured into my eyeballs.<br/><br/>It does not apologize. It does not try to make sense. There are machine guns and orcs and dragons and Nazis and robots and samurais. There are scantily clad women. With swords. I liked the dark overtones in the ""real"" world, and I could not stop grinning for the entire thing.<br/><br/>If you know what you're getting into before you see it, you will enjoy it. You might even be surprised that there's a little bit more substance than you expected. It certainly is an unconventional ""plot wrapper"" to bundle up all that action, which makes it refreshing.<br/><br/>I thought the very end got a little too preachy... I mean, you just had a movie where women in leather underwear shoot goblins out of a helicopter, you don't get to ask philosophical questions at the end. But it doesn't matter, because the rest of it was enjoyment for enjoyment's sake. At one point I just started laughing because the movie was so absurd. I was giddy the entire time, and I don't think I'd have it any other way. It doesn't try to be anything but the most shameless, awesome, fantastic action movie you can possibly imagine, and it hit the nail on the head."

Expect the unexpected.<br/><br/>Without spoiling it for anyone, the story of 'Sucker Punch' takes us on the journey of ""BabyDoll"" an abused young woman put into care by her evil stepfather.

If you like guns, monsters, and girls not wearing much for an hour and a half, then this is a film for you.<br/><br/>The thing that gives this review an undisputed 7/10 in my opinion is the visuals. Every sequence in this film has something about it. Whether it's the way the moonlight is caught shining through babydoll's window in the very first scene, or one of the vast landscapes during the action scenes, there will be SOMETHING that takes your breath away.<br/><br/>If you buy the DVD, and watch it on a portable TV, I don't think you'll enjoy it.<br/><br/>Watch it on the big screen, this could be a big success!"

At the institution, Baby Doll meets the other girls-- Rocket, Sweet Pea, Amber, and Blondie, as well as the evil owner of the institution, Blue. Baby Doll learns that a character known as the ""High Roller"" is coming for her in 5 days. She decides to escape from the facility before then, and retreats to an alternate reality to help her and the other girls execute an escape plan.<br/><br/>For the most part, the story was excellent. There were some melodramatic moments, especially towards the end, but there are many more great moments than bad ones. I'll admit, the acting of the girls wasn't great, which was a hard hit seeing as the film is centered around them. Oscar Isaac did a good job as Blue, but Carla Gugino's Russian accent was...um...strange.<br/><br/>I thought the alternate reality idea was great and really original. Basically, Baby Doll can use music to enter the alternate reality and she envisions the other girls there with her. The girls must obtain five items in order for them to escape. There are different levels of the alternate reality, and in each one the girls obtain an item that represents an item they need to get in real life. As they obtain the items in the alternate world, they obtain the items in the real world.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was really good, action-packed, and had amazing visuals.

"MrJRGO","8","9","17","12 May 2011"," Action packed with great CGI and gorgeous girls.
","""Sucker Punch"" is a visual treat from start to finish. There is no deep meaning that people on the IMDb review boards keep trying to find. It is simply made up of action packed segments, dominated by excellent special effects and the sort of girls you'd love to have on your arm (unless you are a girl).<br/><br/>This is style over substance. The acting is ordinary. The dialogue is average. The operational brain cells required to enjoy the chaotic spectacle going on in front of your eyes are virtually zero. It's loud. It's fun. And at the end, you may feel sucker punched. I was certainly bruised. <br/><br/>Funnily enough, the best portrayal comes from Scott Glenn who plays the mysterious guide. He is brilliant. His role is small, but he more than makes up for it with a consummate performance. He captures the mystery of the character to perfection. His cool, assured demeanour is in sharp contrast to the perilous situations that the girls find themselves in. <br/><br/>The film got poor reviews but the critics failed to see it for what it really is - brash, almost pornographic, nonsensical chaos that enlivens the senses and blows your mind. When Zack Snyder made ""Sucker Punch"", he filled the special effects tank full of gasoline and slammed the pedal to the floor. He wasn't interested in script or characterisation so don't expect any.<br/><br/>The poor worldwide box office can be put down to ""Sucker Punch"" being too action packed and violent for the girls and because too many men still have a problem with watching gorgeous scantily clad women kick ass. Okay, this isn't as good as ""300"", but it isn't that far off either. The worldwide total of less than $90 million is a travesty.<br/><br/>The girls are undeniably gorgeous and the storyline is undeniably thrown together without any thought whatsoever. However, it is the CGI and the soundtrack that are the stars of the show here. Lots of noise, plenty of anger, a high level of violence and a whole lot of breath-taking action. Oh and I hope I didn't forget to mention the gorgeous half-naked ass kicking girls. <br/><br/>If you expect anymore than the above, you will be sorely disappointed."

By now it is not very novel, but there are some intriguing touches in the way the layers relate. The first is that of all the parallel lines, the commenting public seems to have all been taken in by the trick of assuming that the first layer you see is the base layer, is reality. In this case, we have an evil man, two susceptible stepdaughters, sexual advance, death and imprisonment of the surviving girl as revenge. She is sent to a corrupt mental institution and lobotomized.<br/><br/>In the few days between admittance and cranial invasion (by eye), we learn of a (woman) doctor that uses theatrical therapy.<br/><br/>We fully buy that on this foundation, other layers are built as fantasy, the next layer being that the asylum is a cover for a brothel, exploiting the girls, none of which appear insane. In this layer, the girls plot an escape. Most die. <br/><br/>A third layer is supposedly what goes on in the mind of our-girl-of-interest while she is seducing patrons in the brothel layer by her seductive, theatrical dance. This has what is considered state of the art CGI battles in different settings.

Unless of course, the first layer is not the base layer. I believe this was an early decision in the structure, submerged as the thing grew bulk. In fact, I believe this is the ""Moulin Rouge"" influence. (The same curtain device is used in the beginning, and the same stage metaphor used to cross worlds. We have the same conflation of acting, inhabiting a life and whoring/dancing.)<br/><br/>So it would at least have been mildly interesting to me: a well financed hack using a folded formula with an intelligent heritage. The boring battles would have been tolerable, but what had me wanting to run away was the vile sexism. The first two layers (counting conventionally) treat the girls as amusing property. There is a disturbing tenor in the approach. Okay, we see that all the time and it can be used creatively to jerk us around. But not here.<br/><br/>Here we are solidly, inescapably, placed as the male in the audience, drooling over the extreme sexualization of the girl. There may be layers for her, but there are none for us. We are given permission because we are placed midway between where we presumably stay in life and the extreme stance of the pimp. His two-fold extreme exploitation gives us the designed room for simple leering, which we are tricked into.<br/><br/>Still, if we had nothing else but that first action scene, minus one trope, I would have been thrilled. This battle is set in a vague Yimou Zhang inspired setting. The heroism, and cuts are reminiscent of old Kar Wai Wong/Chris Doyle. It is not novel but it has some sweep and you do get swept up in it (assuming you have forgotten the prior stuff).<br/><br/>But even this has something that offends. I do not know the name of this pose. It is when the hero has jumped an extraordinary distance to enter a fray. He/she has one knee down, the same hand on the ground. The other knee is up and that hand has a weapon. This is the moment when you can see the glower in the hero's face where the environment is about to be justly destroyed. He/she has confidence that you as the viewer will not allow her to lose. Whenever I see this, I choke, just as when I see at the other at the end of an event calmly walking away in slo-mo while some profound conflagration erupts behind, gently blowing hair.<br/><br/>A perceptive reader pointed out what he saw as the Henry Darger connection. Look it up. A cool insight.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

","I would like to start my review emphasizing on the main idea of the film. There isn't the hackneyed impact between good and evil. It is about the material and spiritual world, which finds place in more and more movies. The storyline can't be compared with the Christopher Noan's ""Inception"", but the mind-blowing special Fx and the attractive actresses are assuring that many people would go to the cinema to watch ""Sucker Punch"". I don't really like movies which main purpose is only money-making. But don't worry because behind that mask with pretty girls and gunshots lies the profound sense of the movie which direct its questions straight to the viewer.<br/><br/>You can see the typical cinematography that Zack Snyder uses with variations when Babydoll and the other girls are fighting with the huge samurais or the merciless monster hordes. Referring to the ""levels"" in Babydoll's fantasy I choose the one with the three samurais as the best one. The mysterious temple and the over-sized warriors are bringing back my memories when i used to play video games. The costumes in the reality and in the imaginary world are also magnificent. The acting isn't the best part of the movie. Carla Gugino makes very impressive performance playing Dr. Gorski and the viewers will definitely remember her speaking.<br/><br/>Comparing with ""300"" and ""Watchmen"" ""Sucker punch"" is more commercially orientated. If you don't like the plot the fascinating characters and the spectacular battles will certainly erase the disappointment from the story. I like this movie and i recommend it to everybody who wants to break up with the reality and feel the sucker punch."

","Me being a fan of Zack Snyder's movies, I went into see Sucker Punch with the correct level of expectations and I came out happy. The movie similar to other Snyder's movies, is fantasy based and high on style with stunning slow-motion action scenes and a pulsating background score. If you expect a classic cinematic masterpiece, give this one a miss. This movie needs to be seen as a out n out commercial entertainer. Girls ruled the movie and they looked hot(particularly Jamie Chung). Great art direction and good editing. This movie might not do well in US but will definitely rake in the moo-la in Orient countries. Snyder's creative imagination knows no bound. 300 , Watchmen and now this movie. I would definitely watch this movie again. Now waiting for Snyder's Superman reboot :)"
"zhaoyufeng925","7","9","17","26 March 2011"," Could have made a bigger success
","The action scenes and the visual style are brilliant. Zack is really an artist and full of experimental and innovative ideas. However, this film could have gone further if without the strange storyline and the dark ending. Zack is a very good story teller but the problem is that he shouldn't really use this type of story for this film. The film did almost everything that it wants to achieve; but it's just that these achievements are somehow covered by the story, which shouldn't be an important part of the film in the first place. I hope Zack could have used a much simpler story so that the audiences can focus more on the visual part of the film, realise its achievements and give a better response. I cannot say that I totally like or enjoyed the film but I still appreciate Zack's work on it. Afterall, still a good job Zack; keep working on. Hope to see more movies made by you.<br/><br/>Oh, one more thing. The part that Baby Doll fights against the three giant warriors, it is, WOW, so cool that I almost don't know how to describe it."
"maxr24","1","20","45","29 March 2011"," Sucker Punch is an offensive piece of garbage.
","This film is the biggest slap in the face the movie industry has ever experienced. I actually found this movie offensive. I came out of the theater to find myself highly frustrated with my experience and I wondered why. Here are the reasons:<br/><br/>Sucker Punch does not try to be a movie. I've seen worse acting, screenplay, direction, soundtrack, etc. in other films. But those were entertaining! They were humorous because somebody tried to make a movie and failed miserably at it. It was funny the same way Americas Funniest Home Videos is funny. Snyder, on the other hand, did not try. He deliberately threw enough money to feed a third-world country for a year at a collection of high-tech YouTube videos and then gloated when the revenues from idiot moviegoers like me kicked in. At least for that, I want to punch him in the face.<br/><br/>Yes, the visual effects are alright. The women, while definitely not the hottest on the planet, are relatively attractive. But the mere fact that this was a piece of eye candy with no intention of being anything else is disrespectful. If this paragraph is making the reader think ""Hey, hot women and cool visual effects, I should watch this"", I have a piece of advice for you. Play World of Warcraft and then watch some porn. These things are much more fulfilling separately, when developed for what they are meant to be. Snyder mates the two to produce a retarded, disturbing child called Sucker Punch.<br/><br/>I feel no need to go into the plot or the quality of the acting in great detail. The plot seems to have been conceived by throwing every single thing that is defined as ""cool"" by moviegoers with an average IQ of 35 and sprinkling it with a disastrous attempt at being inspirational to the 14-yearold emo girl audience. The acting made me feel like the movie is a trial to see how long I can last before throwing something at the screen. I failed that challenge about 35 minutes in.<br/><br/>Finally, I'll mention that this movie had absolutely nothing original about it. No, I don't mean that it didn't tickle your brain in a particular way or that it didn't make you reanalyze the point of your existence. I mean that every single darned concept of this movie has been done somewhere before – and done much better. Sucker Punch is the cacophony of film.<br/><br/>In short, Sucker Punch is pure garbage. Please, don't watch this film."

"RockPortReview","7","5","8","3 April 2012"," Sucker Punch is Fun and Engaging!
","""Sucker Punch"" is the highly stylized feast for the eyes that is director Zack Snyder's trademark. Starting after his breakout 2004 remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" his movies are massive in scale and budget as well as stretching the boundaries of what CGI can do. ""300"", ""Watchmen"" and ""Sucker Punch"" are all perfect examples of this. Normally the gratuitous use of CGI and heavily processed imagery is something I try to avoid at all costs. But for some reason I can't help it when he comes out with a new film, especially with ""Sucker Punch"". Yeah, I'm a sucker and deserve to be punched.<br/><br/>Nothing more than a guilty pleasure and junk food for the brain. ""Sucker Punch"" stars one of my personal favorite actresses in Emily Browning (The Uninvited, Sleeping Beauty) as Baby Doll a girl who is sent to a Mental Institution by her step father. Five days before getting a lobotomy, her mind escapes to a sort of fantasy world brothel where she meets a group of other such girls. She joins Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) her sister Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung) who all wish to be free. The girls need five items in order to escape. A map, fire (a lighter), a knife, a key, and a mystery object. The plot is kind of cheesy and stupid, but its really deeper than it looks. Chockfull of symbolism and alternate meanings that multiple viewings are encouraged..<br/><br/>Every time Baby Doll dances we go deeper into another fantastical universe where the girls need to fight to obtain one the five items. Each world they go into has it own unique theme from Feudal Warriors and The Trenches to Dragons and Distant Planets. Obviously the heavy fantasy element caters perfectly to Snyder's talents as a visual filmmaker. He tries for a Matrix level of coolness an makes a decent effort, but its hard to aim for coolness as it often comes off as pandering and cliché.<br/><br/>This movie really is a teenage boys wet dream with hot girls, big guns, crazy action and enough CGI to choke a horse. I don't know what that says about me but we all need our guilty pleasures. The blu-ray edition contains an extended cut of the film adding on an additional 17 minutes. So all of you geeks and dorks out there check it out if you haven't already.<br/><br/>For more reviews visit www.RockportFilm.com"

"stephenlfrance","6","5","8","18 October 2011"," Now this is the rabbit hole
","The introduction to the story reveals a young girl, institutionalised in a mental hospital by her abusive step father. Her imagination fortifies a paranormal world in her mind as both a means of survival and strategy for escape.<br/><br/>This film is very abstract in nature.<br/><br/>Initially, the plot's direction is obscure as our protagonist appears to transcend three worlds: The first where she is institutionalised in an asylum for the insane; the impression denoted by this world is that it is reality.<br/><br/>In the second place, she is slave to the desires of a high-class brothel; it is not clear in the beginning whether this is her subsequent venture from the asylum or her imagination.<br/><br/>The third is a land, depicted as a place in her mind – a world where anything is possible, from gravity defying Martial Art skills to supernatural antagonists. The music used during transcendence into this alternate universe is unusual, but addictive. The scenes are action- packed and intriguing as the audience is brought to question what this world represents.<br/><br/>Arguably, this film script forms a unique version of the famous Alice in Wonderland tale. It is an enigma throughout the duration, it sustains suspense regarding the conclusion and the ending is a valuable lesson.<br/><br/>This is not an amazing film, but I would definitely recommend it for its enjoyment factor.<br/><br/>By Stephen Leslie France"
"Jonathon_Natsis","6","5","8","9 April 2011"," A video game without the controller.
","Visual artist and director Zack Snyder brings us the latest in his unique filmography of stylized violence following on from recent works such as 300 and Watchmen. If you believe all the negative hype utterly rubbishing this movie, you might just (as is the case with most movies with preconceived low expectations) be pleasantly surprised. Because while Sucker Punch is no masterpiece, it performs admirably in the action department, coupled with a frenetic pace; all but overwhelming its weaker attributes.<br/><br/>Young adult Babydoll (Emily Browning) has lived a life of abuse under her stepfather, until she finally cracks in an unsuccessful attempt at murder. The authorities lock her away in a mental asylum for her crime, but she soon learns it merely acts as a front for a burlesque theatre run by the power-hungry Blue (Oscar Isaac). Determined to escape the facility, she enlists the help of several other detainees when it becomes apparent that her dance leaves all the orderlies in a state of trance, while transporting the inmates to a fantasy world where they must face monsters conjured up by their own mind, and where their actions in this parallel universe mimic ramifications in the real world.<br/><br/>Okay, at the risk of pointing out the obvious, the plot is bizarre to say the least, but don't be turned off by its outward nature. The director makes it very clear that this film takes place not in our world, but in the Snyder-verse, which abides by different laws and powers to ours. Hence, it becomes contextually easy to suspend disbelief throughout. In fact, while the whole notion behind entering different worlds through the mind has been touched on by a whole host of earlier films, the idea that both fantasy and reality are eerily related, as in Sucker Punch, offers some food for thought, even if it isn't delved into as much as you might hope.<br/><br/>The few scenes that occur in the real world that involve the girls planning their next move only serve as some sort of plausible link between one exuberant action scene and the next. They almost feel like cutscenes to a video game before the actual level starts, and the fact that they must collect 'five items' to complete their plan of escape does little to dispel that illusion. And make no mistake, each new mission, although entertaining and visually spellbinding, is a conglomerate of fan-serving stylized madness including, but not limited to, robot samurai and zombie Nazis. So beware if you don't consider yourself an over-the-top action kind of guy.<br/><br/>A film that opens with such a compelling scene (and an excellent example of how to tell a story just through pictures alone) disappointingly falls into a fairly formulaic series of events from that point on. A dull script and occasionally wooden acting don't help either, and although I admit that the ending could have been a lot worse, it is a case of the filmmaker trying to do too much with his subject matter. Questionable character motives, as well as the casting of Jon Hamm as two polarising characters casts doubt on the authenticity of the story; an unnecessary add-on that fails to remain in line with the rest of the film's tone.<br/><br/>However, as mentioned, the positives of Sucker Punch do a decent job of outweighing the negatives. The voice-over narration is used sparingly but effectively for the most part, and the soundtrack may just be the film's biggest highlight in any way that doesn't pertain to magic dragons and flying robots. It's a unique piece likely to differ from person to person more so than most other films would, but I felt it was by no means a bad effort.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"

Bad doesn't describe it properly, and this is coming from a guy in his mid 20s who loves movies that generally get rated horrible by critics and to a smaller extent people as well.<br/><br/>I came in waiting to see exactly what others here described in their 7-9 star reviews. That would be an ""anime"" live action flick, a bit of ""Sin City"" mixed with a a very lite ""Inception"".<br/><br/>Spoilers past this.<br/><br/>What i got was a story about the main character who wasn't at all about the main character but wasted 1 and a half hours on her. Also got horribly flat acting, extremely bad dialogue that makes fast and furious movies sound like the king's speech, sporadic action scenes where everything is shaky cam intertwined with fast cuts to hide bad choreography, absolutely no character development, a dream within 2 dreams only 1 of which actually has an ""intro"" that identifies going in and out of.<br/><br/>Now for the jist of the actual plot vs what actually happens on screen. Main character goes to asylum and immediately imagines it being a ""gentlemns"" club without any sort of transition into this dream state interpretation to let you know its started. Then when she supposedly starts dancing she is so ""raw"" that she mesmerizes all the men watching her while in the mean time her mind wanders around and we see 5 minute displays of nazi zombies, lord of the rings and i robot in her different dream sequences. The problem here is they also show no dancing, she just swings 2 centimeters left and then right and the dream starts...<br/><br/>When she comes to from those dance-dreams, absolutely every scene has girls crying in it and comforting each other, there's no difference to move the story forward.<br/><br/>Lastly i saved the visual effects for last because i love movies alone based on them, like 2012, even if its weak in other parts. There are very few movies that come to mind that have this bad and blatant CGI that i've seen. People saying its supposed to be a ""fantasy"" setting don't understand that fantasy is not a way to describe ""bad"".<br/><br/>Also, just as a side note for guys who thinks there's eye candy in this worth it enough to see, get your ticket money and go buy a calendar with random girls for each month.

","In the past, one could've been forgiven for thinking that Zack Snyder had a measure of talent. His remakes and adaptations had been enjoyable movies at the very least, even his polarizing big screen version of ""Watchmen"" could be admired for its effort and faithfulness. Without seeing what original ideas could spark from his imagination, Snyder fans could always argue that we've yet to see his full potential. Now we have.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is very light on words. Its first line of dialog is heard fifteen minutes after the opening frame and the characters don' talk much for the first half hour. Thank God for it because once you hear that first line, you'd wish Snyder had stuck to making this entire thing a music video with explosions. I'd offer examples of the gems that are sprinkled through this work of cinematic genius, but after eight hours my brain's gone and erased every memory of the few spoken lines in order to preserve my sanity. Suffice to say that Snyder appears to comes from the Lucas school of screen writing. Step 1) State the obvious. Step 2) Make everyone talk like badly translated manga characters. Step 3) Squash all ambiguity so the silly audience won't be confused.<br/><br/>The horrific dialog is the most obvious sign of an incompetent writer, but that's not the only problem. A bad writer with a bad idea will never get made. A bad writer with a good idea will get re-written. A bad writer with a good idea who also has money to produce will get his script made as is, to hell with any criticism. Because it's a BAD writer with a good idea, he or she will magnify every flaw with poor or stereotypical execution and corrupt any good by being too obtuse. Such as the case here. The story operates on three levels of reality, the insane asylum, the burlesque club, and the violent world. The first is absolute reality, the third is the protagonist's imagination (I think), and the second is never explained. <br/><br/>In fact, for those who thought that ""Inception"" was confusing, at the very least it jumped between three levels of reality without confusing us as to why they're there. ""Sucker Punch"" in the meantime, lost me on its very first dive and then keeps diving, hoping that the endless amounts of skin and stylized action would make me forget the lack of explanation. It didn't work. By removing the context of what the main character is doing and by never explaining whether her friends are actually insane, we don't whether or not to root for her. In fact, in the very act of NOT explaining, Snyder's managed to make all of his fantastic actions scenes utterly meaningless. Why do we care that she's fighting? <br/><br/>Sucker Punch could've been something great. Not Oscar worthy perhaps, but with little effort it might've been the most entertaining film of the year, raked in at the box office, and become a fan classic. It still might rake in at the box office, but it will never see the light of day again. Zack Snyder had all the money he could've asked for, a great cast that wanted to do something good, a production and effects team that wanted to do something good... and instead he made this. An incoherent, overblown, excruciatingly cheesy fallacy of a movie that fails at the most basic aspects of storytelling. No excuses, Snyder."

"mredude411","8","14","30","25 March 2011"," Zach Snyder is the better Michael Bay
","Walking into this movie, I had mixed expectations.<br/><br/>With Zach Snyder directing, I knew I was going to get plenty of action with so much slow-mo that it would probably kill me. I was correct with that assumption.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the movie seemed like it had a great premise, and in combination with Snyder's directing style, I thought it could be a damn good movie.<br/><br/>Now after seeing it, I am slightly conflicted. So I will just break it down into different points.<br/><br/>CG/Action: HOLY BALLS WHAT IS GOING ON! OH MY GOD THAT IS SO CRAZY WH.. OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! So in other words, it was pretty amazing. Action was great, with good uses of slow-mo though there was definitely too much of it, and with any movie with too much slow-mo, you get 1 or 2 unnecessary shots of something flying through the air with a slow-mo close up, or some kind of slow-mo battle hit on something/someone. And overall, it was used too much, and I was fully expecting a lot of slow-mo.<br/><br/>Not even talking about the action, just the landscape, the scenery and all that jazz. It was still pretty impressive. The worlds they give you when you are in Baby Girl's mind are creative, expansive, detailed and a little bit breathtaking, though the action makes it too fast to be out of breath for long.<br/><br/>Acting: This was really hit or miss. Baby Girl really didn't have much acting to do with all the action scenes she was in. She could pull off the action scenes (while getting me excited in more ways than one), but off the actions scenes, there were a few good, and a few bad. The other girls, again had a lot of action scenes, so those were choreographed well, but out of them, just some good and bad. Blondie has a moment where... Well, if you have ever seen Happy Gilmore, there is a seen where he is about to get hit with a car, and someone screams ""HAPPY LOOK OUT AH!!!"" but it comes out as ""HAPPYLAGADAH!"". If you don't know what I am talking about, watch the movie again =p. It was funny, which went completely against what the scene was going for.<br/><br/>Again, it was hit or miss. <br/><br/>Concept/plot: From what I understood of the movie, the concept seemed pretty good. Some girl getting locked away for some reason, and she had to go into her mind for some reason to escape. During/After, I loved the concepts presented. How the whole escaping your mind thing came into play, the important plot points that fueled the whole thing, they were all intriguing and interesting. I don't want to give anything away, so I will be vague, but the ideas themselves are very captivating. Fused with the plot, you have a grand idea for a movie. Not necessarily unique, but still something that can make a great movie.<br/><br/>The execution of it all was disappointing though. Well, that is misleading. They did it in ways that were good, but there was so much more they could have done with it. They left out points that would make parts of movie much better, and they had a few parts that could have been changed or done differently. Give the concepts to a director such as Peter Jackson or Martin Scorsese, and it could have been done beautifully. Zach Snyder, though I like him, he doesn't make the most phenomenal movies with compelling plots.<br/><br/>Actor/Actresses: Well, mostly actresses... Yeah everyone was gorgeous, beautiful, and most of the guys in the theater were probably turned on through most of the movie, through a combination of explosions and revealing clothing. I have no complaints.<br/><br/>Overall, I think it was a good movie. Expect a lot of the appeal to be in the action, but the plot isn't totally devoid of worthiness. There are some cool points, decent acting and intriguing ideas, and in the genre of action, Zach Snyder is definitely does it better than Michael Bay, but don't expect another Inception."

","*** SPOILERS too for Life of Pi & Tomorrowland *** I must remark that this review have spoilers about those excellent movies too.<br/><br/>Honestly, I don't know what is wrong with the movie. I think that too many people does not really understand the message in this movie, or even talks about another kind of messages which really are not there (like feminism... some people maybe are on defensive mode all the time) I mean, the message is clear as a crystal, others messages are subjectives... even the feminist message which a lot of people finds. OK... I must agree with something there, women, by far, have suffered more abuses in our society than men, and because all characters are women in a hospital, you can believe that the message is more related with the women condition, but you can carry this message to everyone. And honestly, this really confuses me, because there is a lot of misunderstanding and incomprehension in our society. I believe that the message in a very simplistic way is: ""A brave way to escape or fight against the cruel and unfair reality, armed with a good human will which sometimes is almost unbreakable"". Some people complain about the meaning of the Babydoll lobotomy. What is the purpose of this action in the movie? Well, its very clear when you link this action with the word ""unbreakable"" (there are a lot of people making lobotomies in our society).<br/><br/>And, because I am trying to explain my astonishment with this phenomenon of the incomprehension or misrepresentation of messages in the movies, I must refer to two great films too.<br/><br/>*** Big SPOILER of Life of Pi ***<br/><br/>For example in the ""Life of Pi"", I encounter people who still have doubts whether the adventure is about a shipwreck with a tiger; even when he explain at the hospital that it is not the true story, and that actually Richard Parker, the tiger, is he (is totally understandable why, a good boy who was pushed to make raw and cruel actions, really wants to forget this chapter of his life and never get back... that is why Richard Parker disappears in the jungle without a look back). Life of Pi, like Sucker Punch, is another way to show this will and the way that some of us overcomes, or at least fight, until the very last moment, with the really bad things in life. Maybe some people doesn't like the style of this movie and likes more the form in which the same message is portrayed in ""Life of Pi"", but that doesn't make this a bad movie, in fact, is another great movie.<br/><br/>*** A little SPOILER, but a spoiler too, of Tomorrowland ***<br/><br/>By the way, Sucker Punch reminds me too, in some particular way, the film Tomorrowland. Another jewel not really recognized and with a great message, but this time, an optimistic and beautiful one, which people doesn't understand because most of them were waiting a lot of rollercoasters in the movie... as if that would make of Tomorrowland a better movie. Honestly, even when I don't like the term of Cult Classic, Sucker Punch, like Tomorrowland, must be called like that, obviously in their respective frames... just like other movies as Donnie Darko did it, or ""The Iron Giant""; another masterpiece of Brad Bird (the same director of Tomorrowland)."

Yes it was very much a young man's fantasies in the women's appearance, but they were strong women, which is why I tolerated the costumes, which actually had to do with the story. And you can't go wrong when they try to say something without trying to force it on you. The girls acting achievement was perhaps not the best, but that was not what was all about. Oscar Isaac, who played nurse / pimp, was by far the most disgusting man on earth in this movie and we just wanted to beat him down.

","Sucker Punch!
By Xareny Ascencio<br/><br/>Are you bored and you're looking for a movie to watch? Well, I know the BEST movie. It is called Sucker Punch!.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is a fiction movie it's about this girl named Babydoll who got put into a Mentally Insane Program for girls only. She tries to escape with help from her dream world that she controls. Also with help from four girls.<br/><br/>One reason why Sucker Punch! is the best movie is that there's not a lot of clues to what will happen next. In that case, it builds suspense. Sucker Punch! catches the viewer's attention. It feels like you are being forced to keep on watching it, in a good way.<br/><br/>Another reason is that it has a lot of violence. Sucker Punch! is an action packed movie. It has a few really insane people, also known as murders. This movie has lots of killing and deaths. For example about five people were killed. Which opens it up to people who like violence.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Sucker Punch! is the BEST action movie. Go to VUDU and watch it. It is only about $3.00 and it is so worth it."
"RatedVforVinny","8","3","4","19 November 2019"," Visually such a treat.
","Although there have been some other slick graphic novel adaptations such as 'Sin City', along the way. Zack Snyder who directed the epic '300', has really excelled himself with 'Sucker Punch'. Visually again it's top notch but now he's got to grips with an intelligent script and a story you really have to switch on to. To say too much about the plot, would in fact spoil such a high recommendation but basically it's thrills and spills all the way! A modern movie that is indeed completely original."
"schanna13","8","3","4","22 September 2014"," Not at all what I expected...
","Let me preface this by saying that I was rather apprehensive to watch this film. I ran across a trailer recently and failed to remember any mention of it after it came out back in 2011. I then instinctively came to IMDb to check the reviews out... Needless to say, the very average rating was disheartening. The movie did have my curiosity, however. I just finished watching the film, and I must say, it is certainly worth the watch. I think one of the reasons some people scored it so low is because they didn't go into it with an open mind. The trailer certainly leads the viewer to believe it is an action flick with boobs and maybe some mind games thrown in. This is not the way to approach this movie though! It is a quirky and very unique two hours, so don't expect it to be a ""normal"" experience. I don't want to give any specifics on the movie because I really do feel like it would be appreciated most by someone who doesn't know what they're about to see. I will, however, tell you that what you'll see with this movie is a fun, entertaining, beautifully shot (or rather, generated), and SMART film. That's just my two cents. If you're looking for a fun movie to rent and maybe watch with a couple of friends, please consider picking this up, even if it's just to enjoy your fantasy of eye-candy bouncing around with swords and short skirts."
"alvarhaggis","6","3","4","9 August 2011"," Good, but there's a catch.
","There are many aspects of Sucker Punch that reaching dizzying heights. Yet so much more seems to fall flat.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is all about reality and escape. It features different formats for these themes that happen in reality, psychologically and metaphorically.<br/><br/>The action, that I am sure brought us to this movie with it's fantastic trailer, was spellbinding. The director once again uses his own kind of graphic style that adds more depth to the action scenes. They're not as bland as many notable Hollywood offerings. So a big thumbs up for the action and graphics.<br/><br/>The acting was very good. The real star for me being Abbie Cornish, who is a joy to watch in every scene she appears in. Particularly the action scenes. She is one actress who really listened to her trainers and worked hard at on what she was told. I swear if I had not known she was acting I could easily believe she had military training. The rest are a good bunch. Apart from your own aesthetic preferences, you would find it hard to choose between the rest of the cast, as they all performed well and suited their characters. So thumbs up for acting and casting on all counts.<br/><br/>The overall story and script were, unusually from this director, quite weak. Perhaps editing killed some of his vision, but I can not see what more could have been added to make you buy into it any more. The story and script where poor in comparison with the rest of the movie. Not poor as in the laughable, cringe worthy and unwatchable kind. But, when compared with the stunning eye candy that doubled as pretty fine actresses, the grandiose and stunning action sequences and the music and general graphical feel of the movie, it fell pretty short in this area. Thumbs down unfortunately for script and story.<br/><br/>It is this last part that makes this movie a bit of a Thorny Rose. There is so much you will love, there is so much you will hate. I guess the diplomatic rating then would be a 5, but I am slightly leaning on my fence and give it a 6.<br/><br/>Good movie, definitely worth a DVD rental for a Saturday night."

","Director Zack Snyder created a world where young girls can dive into an alternate reality and have the power to kick some serious ass. When Baby Doll, Emily Browning, is put into an insane asylum by her abusive, controlling step father that is ordering her to get a lobotomy, she uses her mind to escape from this tragic world and creates a reality where she visualizes a plan that will help her and her friends escape. Unfortunately, she only has a few short days and escaping is quite impossible especially when Blue Jones, Oscar Isaac, is not just keeping the girls inside a mental hospital, it's also a disgusting brothel. Can Baby Doll and friends escape or will she be a victim of a lobotomy living in a brothel/mental institute where disgusting men control young innocent girls? I saw this movie the day it came out, and I've tried to write this review a number of times but just couldn't muster up the words to describe it. The story line was intriguing, but brutal. The film starts out with an intense scene of Baby Doll accidentally killing her sister right after they watch their mother die. Her scary abusive stepfather forces her to this mental hospital which is also a brothel. Watching young innocent girls be controlled by filthy older men is hard to watch. But, Snyder made it interesting by having these core 5 girls be fearless, uncontrollable, strong and relentless. Baby Doll, portrayed by Emily Browning is seen fighting enormous creatures with swords and tumbling through the snow as if she has been trained all her life. Sweet Pea, portrayed by Abbie Cornish, is only in the institution because her sister Rocket, played by Jena Malone, ran away from home and was captured here; Sweet Pea followed her and has to care for her. Blondie, Vanessa Hudgens and Amber, Jamie Chung will do anything to escape this horrible brothel prison. All five girls are fighting in the alternate reality with guns and their strength. I love how it's these beautiful young girls with their hair and makeup completely done and they all are kicking butt! The shots in this film are beautiful. I love Snyder's style. He tells even the ugliest stories, beautifully. He has his slow motion action shots and the gritty colors that convey the entire tone for the film.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film up until the ending. I guess because I didn't completely understand it. I think Snyder complicated the ending to make it more unique but it hurt the film and the ratings. I highly recommend seeing this film to anyone who enjoys Zack Snyder's directing style and young girls that can fight like characters in a video game, otherwise wait for the DVD."

","You'll either get this, or you won't; it's definitely not for everyone.
However, if you just go into this with an open mind, and no specific expectations, you might find the experience entertaining, maybe get the metaphorical messages woven within, but at the very least have an appreciation for the profound visual artpiece that this production is.
On the surface, of course, one could simply pass this off as a ridiculously silly story populated with absurdly one dimensional, cliche characters. But then again, there's much to be symbolically extracted from this story if one wants to look at the layers within. Even under the worst of circumstances, and the characters here are most certainly mired in a very dark situation, a dream can still flourish from which empowerment can be possible.
Such is the nature of Baby Doll's potential demise, having been brought into this terrible situation as the outcome of her abusing scumbag father's scheme to rob her of her inheritance by having her committed to an insane asylum, where her fate is to become lobotomized. However . . .
The story, such as it is, is not meant to be taken literally, but rather appreciated for the metaphorical messages within, wrapped up into a series of visually spectacular fantasy vignettes.
As suggested earlier, this production is not for everyone, but I'm guessing most viewers will still come away from this having experienced something uniquely entertaining.
The production quality is first rate, and even though the characters here are meant to overly exaggerated cliches, the acting was well done. Given the ambitious nature of what was being attempted, this could have turned out much worse, it was definitely a risky gamble to try to pull this off and have it work as intended<br/><br/>I can go with eight stars here and not feel that's overstating it's value as a well done, graphic novel fantasy artpiece."

Lest I'm in the closet and now in middle age about to unleash traits and feelings previously untapped. Which if the latter is true you would have to say well done Zack Snyder, for that's serious film making...<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is loud, full of visual orgasms, musically adroit, exciting, clever and very sexy. Snyder has made no secret of his fetish leanings when making this piece, but it hardy constitutes a dark seedy mind at work. It can easily be argued that the film is very much pro women, the story itself - in amongst the explosive thunder of the fantastical action - is tender and beautiful, complete with emotional kickers. Perhaps it's in the eye of the beholder? But I see a strong female led action movie, with shifting fantasy realms, and cunningly it calls for deeper ponder come the finale.<br/><br/>Love it or hate it, Snyder has pushed buttons with this exercise. Better that than another cash cow sequel or another remake, re- imaging or rebirth. 7/10"
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","7","4","6","8 April 2017"," Dazzling and unique
","I'm already giggling picturing the cries of protest that will rise up when I post this review, but the hell with it, I really like Zach Snyder's Sucker Punch. I never deliberately play the contrarian, I just seem to often gravitate towards films that have been maligned by the masses, and I can't really help it. Now, in this film's case, a few of the many and varied negative criticisms are somewhat warranted, yet blown out of proportion when you really take a good look at the story. The film is pure style, and although Zachary might have let his imagination run a little wild and clutter the whole affair with fanboy fantasies and video game visuals, there is a clear and discernible story beneath if one cares to look. Now, the only way that story is entirely comprehended is by watching the extended director's cut, which includes an absolutely crucial, pivotal scene that's should have never, ever ended up on the editing room floor for the theatrical version. Seriously, they we're straight up asking for hostility and confusion by not keeping it in every cut of the film, it's just common sense. Speaking of story, here we go: the film opens in breathless style and classic patented Snyder slo mo, with young Baby Doll (Emily Browning) trying to save her little sister from their tyrannically abusive stepfather. Outsmarted and shipped off to an austere mental institution, her journey is a sad, surreal and somewhat befuddling one, but there's a method to the madness that might not be clear with only one viewing of the film. The asylum she is sent to is plagued by a sinister orderly (Oscar Isaac) who is abusing the girls in his care, and as a result, Baby Doll channels such horrors into a grandiose set of fantasy worlds, the base of which rests on a burlesque style brothel where she and others work for volatile pimp Blue (also Isaac). Joined by Amber (Jamie Chung), Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone) and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), she blocks out the reality of what is happening and replaces the details of an elaborate, systematic escape attempt with impossibly epic, highly stylized adventures, each of a different theme or set in a vaguely familiar period of history. Battling medieval dragons, giant samurai golems with mini-guns, WWI zombie hordes in a gaunt, bombed out European landscape, it's all a detailed rush of sound and fury that hits you like a ton of bricks, and although is far too much for the film to handle and still get its point across, it's completely dazzling stuff, especially on Blu ray. Guided by a mysterious Wise Man (a kickass, rootin tootin Scott Glenn) who shows up in a different get up each time and mentored by brothel Madam of sorts Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), each setting holds the key to move along a certain cog in their plan, correlating back down the line of delusions straight to the asylum, if a little tenuously. Now it all hinges on the arrival of the High Roller (Jon Hamm), a rich playboy who has come to the brothel to see Baby Doll dance, and probably more. Here's where they messed up royally: The scene I mentioned earlier is a monologue from him that is pretty much one of the most important parts of the film, capping off both realities beautifully, and without it, not only is Hamm relegated to basically a walk on extra, the entire final punch of the climax is rendered lost and neutered, not too mention quite uncomfortable in a sense. Whoever was in charge of that particular piece of the editing should be tarred, feathered and run off the studio lot by teamsters. With the scene left in on the extended version, however, the story is given both point and purpose, feeling like a complete vision with a little weight to go along with it's Hindenburg sized bag of visual tricks. Not Snyder's best for sure, but it's in no way close to the turkey some people will have you believe it is. Whiners. Style over substance? Yes, I'll definitely concede there's an imbalance, but don't try and tell me the whole thing is bereft of substance at all, because that is a lazily researched argument. The soundtrack is a treasure chest, I might add, with beautiful covers of Sweet Dreams and Sing Me To Sleep sung by Browning herself."
"kevbru","7","4","6","31 March 2015"," My Review of Sucker Punch
","I give this movie a 7 out of 10. The Movie is about a young girl who is sent into an asylum by her evil step dad and then creates and alternate reality in her head in order to find a way to escape. Emily Browning did an amazing job at portraying Baby Doll, her real name (in the film) was not used because they were given stripper names. This was not just a normal asylum. During the film the director, Zack Snyder, used many different elements including music and camera angles to give a sense of suspense or shock during the scenes. What i think makes this such a great film is because it is very serious about a girl being trapped and misused, however in her alternate realities, Baby Doll gets to fight in many engaging action scenes throughout the movie instead of watching her dance on stage. Which also helps make the movie more about the character and not about half naked girls dancing on stage for fat old men smoking cigars."
"Tweekums","7","4","6","17 September 2014"," Welcome to the asylum
","In the opening sequence we see a girl attempting to save her little sister from her abusive stepfather; unfortunately she is too late and he has already killed her; he then has her committed to a sinister asylum. The director, Blue, tells her she must be ready to please High Roller in a few days the asylum appears to double as a brothel with the female inmates expected to satisfy rich 'visitors'. As part of their therapy the girls must dance; when our protagonist, who has been dubbed Babydoll, starts to perform she finds herself transported to a fantasy world where she meets a man who tells her she will need five things to gain her freedom; a map, fire, a knife, a key and another item only she will know he also gives her a variety of weapons that she will need to defeat three twelve foot demonic samurai! Once they are dispatched she finds herself back in the asylum; apparently her dance was amazing. She then tells the girls of her plans to escape and together they work to get the items; each time the try to get one Babydoll distracts people with her dance; during which times she is transported to a different fantasy world where she and the other girls battle a variety of dangers and any failures have consequences in the real world assuming anything we see after her arrival at the asylum is real.<br/><br/>I probably wouldn't have watched this if my favourite reviewer hadn't been very negative about it; I was curious to see why! Perhaps because of this it proved better than my expectations; the story is dark; much darker than I expected. The fantasy scenes feature some fairly obvious CGI and music video aesthetics but that just emphasised that what we are seeing is fantasy rather than the reality of the film. The action is stylishly, rather than realistically, choreographed and looks great. One of the main complaints about the film is the fact that the girls are sexualised, even though they don't do anything sexual; this isn't too unfair and I'm sure some, but not all, viewers will feel uncomfortable with it others will love the sight of Emily Browning dispatching foes with a katana while wearing in a skimpy sailor fuku! Those expecting a happy ending with everybody escaping will be in for quite a shock as there are casualties and then the film delivers its final Sucker Punch which will leave the viewer wondering what if anything we've seen is real. The cast do a fine job; in particular Emily Browning is good as protagonist Babydoll and Oscar Isaac is delightfully creepy as the sleazy Blue. Overall I enjoyed this far more than I expected and would recommend watching it, although despite its '12' Certificate I'm not sure it is suitable for younger viewers."
"samanthameerasiva","8","4","6","18 January 2012"," graphic novel and video game-esque; like that's a bad thing.
","The visuals of 'Sucker Punch' are beautiful and it is impossible to not envision the latter as a video game or a graphic novel. The thing is a lot of critics hated this aspect whilst I loved it. The music was beautiful and melded with the scenes and tones brilliantly. Acting was good, not great, and the girls shared chemistry. Isaac played a creepy and scarily powerful 'villain of sorts'. I believe the bad reception 'Sucker Punch' received was unwarranted. The reaction was a clear display of audiences not willing to understand it. Many people accused it of being misogynistic which is a stretch; somehow we should be horrified when women are dolled up and kicking ass. However I disagree, in many ways it was a new example of feminism; women can be strong and hot, they can have inseparable bonds and trust. It was critiqued for having a badly written screenplay and bad acting. I disagree. The screenplay was original and that is what has caused so much uproar. People cannot handle the unknown and undone even when they think that they are the most open minded types. If you enjoyed 'Watchmen', 'Sin City' and any film that took a surrealist approach when storytelling as well as encapsulating beautiful visual styles up to the cast then you will enjoy 'Sucker Punch'. Keep an open mind and be blown away by brilliant graphics."

","I do not get why this movie got a really bad review from the expert critics. I swear to God, what I saw in this movie is something inspiring and just defined what being human truly is. This whole movie is a jumble of metaphors. To me, if you approached it emotionally (leaving the fact that it's ""girls holding guns"" and killing robot zombies and dragons), you can pinpoint the beautiful setting it showcases. Sure, the plot flawed to an extent, but maybe that portrays something; it is not perfect because that's what reality is, what life is. Most movies today can not portray imperfection as stunning, memorable, and all-time godly... but this one for sure has a lot of intricate ideas and communication that inflicts a sense of epiphany deep down our dignity: a struggle to win can be obtained, but it's never absolute... and when you've reached a point where you have to choose between two lives, a sacrifice is yet to conquer.<br/><br/>I don't know if that whole made sense, but anyways, what I don't also get are 1.) Character progression. 2.) Unoriginal? 3.) Soulless and doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>Spoiler: Clearly, every character in this movie progressed.<br/><br/>a. Baby Doll lost everyone she cares about (i.e. mother and sister), and at the beginning she was gloomy and her facial expressionless. But she transformed into an angel, as described in the beginning of the movie. She fought for her freedom, but realize in the end that saving someone is better than her selfless longing.<br/><br/>b. Sweet Pea, who at first reluctant about joining the crew, reveals that her love for Rocket is greater than being killed and decides to band together.<br/><br/>c. Rocket longs freedom the most out of the five but has to give it up to take a knife for the person she cares ultimately.<br/><br/>d. Amber, from an amiable, nice but sort of a coward girl, turns into a daredevil and collects two items needed for escape, fire and knife.<br/><br/>e. Blondie, supposed to be smart, snitches that ends up with tragedy.<br/><br/>f. Dr. Dorski becomes an individual from a puppet that started when she called the police on Blue.<br/><br/>Unoriginal? This is not Inception. It's not a fantasy within a fantasy... This is is just a mere imagination. It's a escape from reality because it's dark and full of malice. The girls are not really experiencing it, it's just a conceit that helps them achieve what need be done. In Baby Doll's head, life happens as it's supposed to. Her ""fantasies"" means this: when you feel that all hope is gone and that the whole world seems to bring you down, don't fret because you still have a mind, ""you have all the weapons you need, now use it and fight to survive."" You can control your mind... and Baby Doll used it.<br/><br/>This movie is far from soulless. At the beginning, the narrator talks about an angel who will help you one day although you don't know what form it's going to take. We are fooled to think that an angel will help Baby Doll to gain freedom, but she is in fact the angel said in the very beginning. She surrendered escape for Sweet Pea to have a chance of flight. Sacrifice may be clichéd, but it was heartfelt. And the bus driver in the end showed what human-beings can and should be."

","I think I got to about half way through. The weedy covers of some of my favourite alt rock songs were bad enough. However, they were not a patch on the vapid, nauseating characters and tenuous storyline. I was so gobsmacked by the painfully tasteless opening scene that I had to watch it again to check that it had really happened.<br/><br/>If you are a fifteen year old boy who loves Bayonetta, Muse videos and teenage girls in fetish wear this is the film for you. If you think mental health problems are edgy and cool and that Japanese stuff is awesome, this is the film for you.<br/><br/>This film suffers, in the worst possible way, from style over substance. Zack has chosen to replace substance with stilted dialogue, a clichÃ© at every moment and characters with less dimensions than Pacman.<br/><br/>The most unforgivable crime is that the film appears to take itself seriously. It lacks the tongue in cheek, B movie authenticity of films like 'Versus'. It is also devoid of any solid premise to act as an anchor for its massively over-produced action scenes.<br/><br/>It feels like the Zackster has taken the blueprint of 'inception', written down a list of 'cool stuff' to include, sucked it dry of any meaning and shat some Kerrang over it. Pictures on a screen do not become profound by adding an Evanescence-esque soundtrack (in fact they become rubbish). I wont even get into the ideological issues I have with the film.<br/><br/>The Z man should not be given money to make films. I actually feel less intelligent after watching this.

The themes of going with the main character(s) reality, and then getting glimpses that they may not be in reality, but that character's hallucinations is a popular addition to many plots now. Most people think the Matrix is what launched this wave of popularity. That movie was done with class though, this movie is just plain warped and tasteless. Again, I really think the appeal would be for the abused, mentally tortured, and sexually abused females. I personally think that's warped, but obviously that's popular in cinema and our culture. If that's not your thing, you most likely won't get much else out of this movie. It seems pretty clear that the producers of this film are people who that is their turn on, and they wanted to waste everyone else's movie going experience to cater to those who share their sick fantasies. <br/><br/>If you're mentally healthy, skip it!

The story is fantastic, easy to follow, and downright original. I can guarantee that the people who do not like this movie are stuck up, and have no imagination, and are probably the kind of people I wouldn't want to hang out with.

Led by Babydoll, they must decide what they are willing to sacrifice in order to stay alive. But with the help of a Wise Man, their unbelievable journey, if they succeed, will set them free.. -- (C) Warner Bros<br/><br/>SUCKER PUNCH may be Zack Snyder's most mature film to date. It deals with dark subjects such as rape, physical abuse, and greed, for it being PG-13 and all, and it carries a surprisingly heavy emotional weight. Although it may seem like an exploitation flick on the outside, SUCKER PUNCH is actually about female empowerment. Snyder smartly downplays the female body as sex objects (although one might expect the opposite, considering his previous films), never giving fully close up views of any part of them, and I really appreciated that. Snyder wanted to make a film that would make young girls feel good about themselves, and he succeeds with flying colors.<br/><br/>The film works mostly because of the female ensemble cast, who all step up to their game (well, MOST of them do). Abbie Cornish and Jena Malone were really quite terrific in their performances. Carla Gugino was pretty fantastic as well, playing an unrecognizable role. However, lead Emily Browning doesn't have much to do but to give mournful expressions in slow motion, which is a shame considering how great of an actress she is. I really wished the screenplay would have fleshed her character out a little bit more, although in the end, the creative reasoning does make sense. Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung are definitely the weakest of the bunch simply because the story doesn't focus on them much, but they get the job done. Oscar Isaac plays a memorable villain, and I'll leave it just like that.<br/><br/>As expected from a Snyder film, SUCKER PUNCH is a visual feast. Snyder has created a unique world, being quite the visionary he is. Seeing the film in IMAX was certainly an eye full. It's almost as if each shot in the entire film was carefully planned, which is a commendable effort. From the production design to the cinematography to the visual effects, they're all pretty much nailed down. The action sequences are mind-blowingly inventive as well. Gosh, does he make slow motion look good. And let's not forget about the totally awesome soundtrack: The renditions of classic songs are amazing. Also as expected (and hinted earlier), the script doesn't quite pack as much punch as the visuals, but it's not as bad as one might expect it to be. It's just that the plot gets repetitious at a point, although Snyder does try to change it up. Also, the pacing could have been fixed a little better, which WATCHMEN also suffered from.<br/><br/>I also must point out how unpredictable the film is. I honestly did not expect a lot of things coming at all. Although far from a perfect film, SUCKER PUNCH is pretty great seeing how far Snyder has come. The visuals are great, although the script isn't as good. The performances by the cast are terrific, and it's just an immensely enjoyable film overall with a great message for young girls out there."
"xenominim","4","19","44","23 March 2011"," Not a Fun Action Movie
","To start off, I like dumb action movies, I even liked 300 and Watchmen. But this is a terrible movie for two very good reasons. One is the characters, which is to say there are none. Nobody has a personality in this movie, you could swap the main character for any one of the other girls and it wouldn't make the slightest bit of difference, she's just 'special' because the plot demands it. Yes it's a dumb action movie, but I still want the characters to be likable, to actually be interested and care about them. Leonidas was a badass warrior, Rorschach was an insane vigilante. The main character here is...a pretty girl. That's it. I dare you to find another personality trait on this chick because she does not have one and shows zero emotion during this film, she doesn't even look like she's having fun making a cheesy movie like Ahnold might be able to bring to a dumb action movie. And lets not forget the main villain is a weaselly dude that most of the girls tower over, so don't expect to find him menacing either.<br/><br/>So that leaves the action to save things. And it doesn't. The movie doesn't have the visceral gore of Snyder's other movies since this is PG-13, so the CGI battles are all bloodless gun battles and chopping up CGI effects. And what I said about characters hurts things here too because there are no standout baddies to fight. Only the first fight of the movie features any sort of trouble for our hero, after that it's just mowing down hundreds of faceless dudes which gets boring surprisingly quick. There's no Agent Smith, no Darth Vader, no climatic battle where our heroes have to summon up all their strength to defeat the main villain. Just chop chop, shoot shoot, done.<br/><br/>You wanna see this movie? Watch the trailer, guess how it ends. You just saved yourself some time and money. The only positive thing I have to say about this movie is the girls are quite nice looking, but this is the Internet, finding pretty girls to ogle isn't terribly difficult."

","First of all, let me say that this movie makes no sense. The movie plot is as explained in the trailer and very little more except that it adds a PG13 ""I Spit On Your Grave"" style torture and characters. As from the trailer, it's a quest for the four items; the fifth item being a mystery - each quest prompting a grand video-gamesque action sequences.<br/><br/>The movie starts off fine, though without explaining much, and devolves so quickly into meaningless flashy sequences devoid of any tension or meaning that you catch yourself feeling jaded of hot chicks in skimpy clothes with machine guns fighting zombie Nazis. To compensate, the movie veers into cruelty, misery and sadistic sequences; a move that offers no payback or for that matter entertainment.<br/><br/>The anachronistic mad-house or battlefield with music from the all the decades oozes style but the poor story really brings down the quality of the movie and is a huge disappointment and more than that, it's not even good entertainment."

","HORRIBLE HORRIBLE MOVIE!!! Absolutely awful. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Zach Snyder is a fantastic director and I'm a fan of his previous work, but this movie was terrible. Their was no character development. Every character was flat. The story line made no sense and the general sense of realism and verisimilitude was non existent. People think that because special effects look cool, that it's a good movie. The ridiculous special effects and pointless action was almost unwatchable. I guess if you like dumb movies where you can leave your brain at the door and sit around like a brainwashed robot and look at visuals for 2 hours then this is your movie. If your actually into ""real"" intelligent movies that actually convey story, mood and emotion, then don't see this movie because it lacks all that. The only thing this movie had was cool visual effects, but even the effects didn't fit with the wildly incoherent storyline.

"OneRingToRuleThemAll13","10","7","13","31 October 2012"," DON'T LISTEN TO THE HATERS!! This movie is a true gem of modern cinema!
","When I first watched the previews for this movie like a year and a half ago, I really thought I would love it. I was thoroughly intrigued by the idea of a bunch of mistreated women fighting for their freedom as they chop down numerous fantasy creatures on the way.<br/><br/>But then, as the movie FINALLY released, so did the negative reviews (including one from my friend who loves movies, and has the same tastes as me), and I began to think that the movie may be a #$%@ after all. So I didn't watch it in the theater. Instead, I waited for it to come out on home video and rented it on Bluray. And as soon as the movie ended, I instantly found me kicking myself mentally for never watching it in the theater, as it would've been an even better experience with the much more potent sound and bigger screen. The movie was all kinds of epic. <br/><br/>For those of you who don't know what it's about, the movie starts with the main character (codenamed Babydoll, as her real name is never revealed. She is played by Lemony Snicket's Emily Browning) who finds herself losing everything: her mom dies, her stepfather (who is implied to have been her mother's killer because he wanted the family inheritance) attempts to kill her and her sister in order to him finally inherit the money after he finds out at they are the heirs, not him (huh, he really should've thought this through, didn't he??), and suddenly she finds herself shooting at him in order to defend herself, killing her sister instead. Accidentally, of course, she wasn't THAT mental, LOL. <br/><br/>After she does, and is launched into a deep depression, her evil stepfather locks her in Lennox House for the Mentally Insane, which is exactly what you think it is. Once there, she meets 4 other women, Rocket (Jena Malone who is easily the film's best character and also the most likable), Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens in her best role yet), and Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), the most important character after Baby herself, and, in her mind, a wise monk who tells her that if she can get a map, fire, a knife and a key, she will be revealed a fifth and final item that will enable her to finally escape her prison, with her newly-found friends in tow. <br/><br/>Anyway, that's the basic plot (kind of a long premise summary, huh?? Sorry about that), I will say no more about the plot in order to not spoil anything, since the plot is one of the movie's most awesome traits. <br/><br/>And then, of course, there is the second-most epic thing about this movie: The fantasy sequences. You see, each time the girls are about to steal one of the items, Babydoll escapes the harsh reality of the asylum and transports herself to the fantasy world that is her sort of coping mechanism with all of the mistreat and stuff that she suffers in it, and so each heist becomes one heck of a wild ride as the girls battle samurais, Nazi zombies, dragons, etc. These segments are so flawlessly conducted (except for the dragon fight, which is a little too short and simple for my taste) that you simply stare at the screen in awe as the girls kick some serious *#$, while also looking fabulous as they do. The fight choreographer of this movie really outdid himself with this one, slow- mo and all. <br/><br/>Then there is the music, which does a wonderful job of setting the bleak, harsh, and epic mood that permeates the entire film. From ''Where is My Mind?'' to ''Rabbit Hole'', to the final moments' track, every piece of music in this movie is pitch-perfect. The gunfire, sword, creature calls and explosion sounds in the fantasy sequences are also great and only help to further immerse you in the experience. <br/><br/>Oh, and the special effects. This part is actually kind of hard to review, because this movie's effects are SO weird! Sometimes they look awesome (i.e the dragon) and then sometimes they look HORRIBLE (the pot of fuel falling on one of the fantasy sequences, won't say which ;) )!! In any case, the guy who was in charge of special effects was smoking pot when he constructed that shot and other parts of the movie. SERIOUSLY! O.O<br/><br/>On a final note, this movie is also really complex, so if you're not into that stuff, you might not like this. Once Babydoll in interned into the asylum, the plot becomes very complex and rich in symbolism. In fact, each of the fantasy sequences is in fact a study of Babydoll's psyche, and each of the girls (including Babydoll herself) represents one part of her personality, and also it's hard to keep track of what is GOING ON with all the parallel universes coming out of Babydoll's mind. The cheat-sheet version is: If you're dumb or just don't care for movies that have messages and symbolism, you might wanna stay away from this one. <br/><br/>Also, it carries a great message of female empowerment that (whereas some people might disagree saying that this film reeks of misogyny) is truly one of the most epic themes I have ever witness in a movie. <br/><br/>Bottom Line: If you like hot chicks, fantasy action sequences that are a sort of genius hybrid of anime and Lord of the Rings, great characters that are richly developed, a great plot and lots of female bada#$sery, then this is the movie for you ;)"

"LegendaryApple","8","7","13","25 April 2011"," A fantasy so absurd and surreal that it is almost poetic
","Welcome to Zack Snyder's reality: A world of Samurai's, Steampunk Wars, Medieval Dragons, and Distant Planet's all set inside of a brothel inside of an asylum. Welcome, also, to one of the most controversial and hated films that has come out so far in good old 2011. Sucker Punch is an oddity, for it has accomplished everything Zack Snyder had intended from the movie... It's making people argue. Here we stand now, with the users facing off against the critics in a film that simply cannot be understood.<br/><br/>So... Reviewing this film is difficult because it's hard to get a grasp on everything that is going on in this visual magnum opus. One minute, we are in a twisted brothel... Seconds later, we are flying through the air with a dragon on our trail threatening to bring us down. Most are quick to dismiss this as stupid and also make a point of saying that the girls are never in any danger when they enter these worlds. Quite the opposite. The scenes aren't about whether or not the girls (called Baby Doll (Emily Browning), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), and Amber (Jamie Chung)) can survive against a dragon, they are there to show, through Baby Doll's eyes, how difficult the things she must overcome in the brothel are. That, and they are just really cool.<br/><br/>Let's start from the beginning. Sucker Punch begins with a captivating music video opening showing us the death of Baby Doll's mother, the drunken rage of her stepfather when he finds out the daughter's get everything from her will, his failure at raping Baby Doll and then attacking Baby Doll's younger sister, and Baby Doll's attempt to kill him, accidentally killing her sister, and being locked up in an asylum to be lobotomized. Ouch. The music (being Emily Browning's remix of Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)) is entrancing and deliciously macabre. The visuals are top notch and impressive. The set-up makes for one of the greatest openings in a movie to date. Flawless.<br/><br/>Before she is lobotomized, Baby Doll escapes into a fantasy to cope with everything that had just happened to her. Baby Doll seems to share the same fantasy as Zack Snyder as she envisions herself in a brothel where she is trapped and must find a way out. During one of the sessions in the brothel, Baby Doll is told to practice dancing erotically. When she begins to dance, she suddenly escapes into a feudal Japanese setting and meets with a wise man who informs her that she needs to find five items (a map, a knife, a key, fire, and a mystery) if she wishes to escape. After fighting three samurai's, she returns to the brothel fantasy and explains her plans to the other girls who then plot their escape.<br/><br/>Then begins the point where the audience finds out if they love or hate this film. Baby Doll dances in front of the people they need to rob (her dancing apparently putting them into a massive trance) and she escapes into the third fantasy to help her cope with the difficulty of obtaining these items. It's really quite entrancing. The same way the people in the movie are entranced by Baby Doll, we become entranced with the amazing visuals.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch has grabbed us at this point, and it is obvious that there are people out there who don't like being grabbed and forced into these trances. The problem comes with the fact that we aren't listening to Zack Snyder. He tells us to let go and to immerse ourselves, yet many of us refuse citing him and his work as idiotic. And it is this that makes Sucker Punch great. It produces from us a struggle from the likes of which few other movies could pull off with such finesse. We are entranced in it's world, whether we like to believe it or not... And all we have to do to enjoy it is to just let go, and allow your mind to escape into it's reality."
"Enchorde","7","7","13","20 April 2011"," Very unconventional, but entertaining and beautiful
","First of all, Sucker Punch is a really controversial, odd movie, certainly not for everyone. It's an uncommon mix of spectacular high octane action and a dark grey psychological drama about a girl wrongfully imprisoned and abused at a mental institution. These sometimes sharp shifts between genres, and contrasts in storytelling, might not be to everyone's liking. If you expect a simple and purely entertaining action movie, you'll probably feel cheated and disappointed, because Sucker Punch certainly isn't that. Sucker Punch works on more levels than that.<br/><br/>Babydoll is a young girl imprisoned and abused at a mental institution in a bid by her stepfather to get to a big heritage. To cope with the abuse Babydoll glides into a different levels of sub-reality in her own imagination. One is that the asylum is instead a brothel (hence the name Babydoll), and in next Babydoll and the other girls form a special military unit in different fantasy or science fiction worlds. It's in these third level worlds that all the action are in. And the action is very good, filled with effects and coordinated combat. But if the movie would have consisted only if this it would have been too simple, unmotivated. The brothel-world builds a framework that the action work inside, and suddenly all action makes perfect sense. But to be honest, without the action the movie would have been quite boring. The different levels in the movie really needs, and feeds of another.<br/><br/>If you want a mental picture of how this works, one way to put it is that Sucker Punch is how the result would be if two of Snyder's earlier movies would have been cut together. Sucker Punch is an peculiar mix of both 300 and Watchmen.<br/><br/>At the same time, Sucker Punch can look like a teenage boys simple fantasy. Hard action, scantily clad young women and both fantasy and sci-fi war. But to discard Sucker Punch as something simple as that is wrong. Then you have missed the bigger picture. I really liked how Snyder makes the different levels interact. How visual small tags in one level become important in another, and vice versa. And one of the big strengths of the movie is the visual component. Sucker Punch is a very beautiful movie. It is skillfully filmed, with smart perspectives and editing, enhanced by a lot of impressive special effects.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Sucker Punch. But then I from the beginning expected a very odd movie. I think it is a must to be open to a unconventional and sometimes provocative storytelling. If you expect something ordinary, you will most likely set you up for a disappointment.<br/><br/>7/10"

Is the dream collapsing, leading to plenty of ""edgy"" entertainment that really requires the audience to be awake and paying attention? Far more ""cerebral"" than ""300"" or ""Watchmen"" this movie makes no effort to explain where it is coming from at all. You really are left on your own. You get it or you don't. What surprises me (a little) is that most of the critics (right now, March 26, 2011) are panning this movie even though it should be a monster hit and make a lot money, and so I expect that the critics will be changing their tune shortly.

What's amazing is that this is coming at you with all the Hollywood bells-and-whistles. It's a mind-blowing fugue. An Aztec temple built to the Gods of Unreason. It's a riff on a sonnet by Nietzsche.

Well, that's the age we live in. Deal with it. Post a negative review on IMDb. Go on--you know you want to.

It's glorious to be alive today and see a film like this!<br/><br/>It makes no attempt what-so-ever to be politically correct and that right there is enough to make it one of the highest-grossing ""cult"" films of all time. Nobody will want to admit that they like this movie (not at first, anyway) because nobody wants to be labeled a ""weirdo."" So what can we make of this? It's more ""over the top"" than Tarantino at his very smarmiest. It's beyond redemption. It's all that and a bottle of tequila. It's perfect.<br/><br/>I think I'll just end this review by providing some guidelines for parents and others. There are no ""scantily clad"" women in this film (not by the standards of the present day). There are women who are wearing clothing that is ""suggestive"" but that is hardly ""misogyny."" I think this movie does deserve an ""R"" rating but the PG-13 is just Hollywood politics as usual. Don't have a cow over it. The sex in this film is virtually non-existent. The violence is certainly served up by the barrel and it's messed up in a fakey-violent way. But it's violent. But that's all meaningless--this movie is not really for kids, even large ones who still live in Mom's basement. It's for...shoot, I don't know. It's for somebody. Me, I guess.<br/><br/>I loved it. Ten out of ten."

But when it is packaged together and marketed for fun, there is something really wrong going on.<br/><br/>The music is god-awful lame and some of the worst remakes ever, and the script is so disjointed that the whole thing collapses under the weight of self-indulgent seriousness that it is a mess of maniacal characters and psychopathic persona's that sour this ""summer fun"" film and leaves a very bad taste."

"DICK STEEL","8","19","45","22 March 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Sucker Punch
","Girls, girls and more girls, decked out in cleavage bearing, tight fitting outfits wielding assault rifles and swords, slaughtering enemies in their way without batting an eyelid, false eyelashes and hairdo all in place, with nary a sweat broken in the process. Welcome to Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch, which played out like a typical Otaku's wet dream chock full of loud action sequences, sizzling sensuality and a narrative that's a poor cousin to Christopher Nolan's Inception.<br/><br/>Yes boys and girls, it's back to imaginary worlds and landscapes all coming from the depths of one's mind and imagination, where these environments are shared with those in the same boat, with the dreamer wielding ultimate power to do almost the impossible within, in a quest to seek that elusive escape back to the real world. Only that it comes with easier kicks based on the end of some pulsating music, and filled with 4 distinct missions to fulfill in order to impact their real world flee from the mental institution they find themselves confined in, with the usual corrupt caretakers at the helm making it more like a prison than to help in rehabilitation.<br/><br/>If you've seen Zack Snyder's live action films, then you'd just about know what to expect from him, with slow-mo signature sequences and an eclectic selection of pop music peppering the background, with Emily Browning doing an excellent cover of Eurythmics' Sweet Dreams, which becomes the film's prologue introducing Browning's Baby Doll, a girl who thwarted her stepfather's attempted rape of her and her sister, but an intervention resulting in her sister's injury meant having the tables turned and thrown into a mental institution, with the warden Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac) bribed to keep her inside long enough to get an unsanctioned lobotomy to keep her quiet, permanently.<br/><br/>So begins a plan to escape from her unlawful detention before the High Roller / Doctor (Jon Hamm) arrives in a few days for the procedure, and we begin that descend into Baby Doll's mind, imagining and painting a landscape that makes it a lot more interesting to look at, since it's a brothel rather than a madhouse, with its predominantly female inmates being exotic dancers with exotic identities trained to gyrate by Dr Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), who finds a gem in the raw newcomer, and Baby Doll soon hatches a plan to escape based on the retrieval of 4 items to aid in her escape mission as guided and introduced by Wise Man (Scott Glenn), with peer collaborators in tow such as Abbie Cornish's Sweet Pea, Jena Malone's Rocket, Vanessa Hudgens' Blondie and Jamie Chung's Amber.<br/><br/>If this is done by a sleazy director, then you'd have plenty of sexy gyrating sequences with the characters decked in various states of undress, but under the hands of Zack Snyder, this spells opportunity for some heavy and very detailed set action sequences, sort of like a Charlie's Angel episode with plenty of amped up ass-kicking and attitude. Despite everyone fawning over Baby Doll's incredible dance moves, they get translated to action, set against various dreamscapes as we descent into yet another layer of the imagination (told you this was a poor cousin to Nolan's Inception), filled with giant Samurais, steam-punked and clock- worked soldiers in war torn Europe with Zeppelins decorating the gloomy skies, Orcs and dragons from Middle Earth and a race against time mission set in a speeding train. Thematically, it advises females to seek and allow that inner self of strength to take charge, but frankly we rather see the visual manifestation of that.<br/><br/>They are all played out like an exaggerated video game, with Snyder at the game controls as he moves the characters like those you see in any typical anime, slicing, dicing and shooting their way through enemies. In fact he fills up the screen with so much details, it deserves a second look just to allow your eyes to roam the background, as the camera moves about in dizzying fashion, usually making the heroines look good as they dispatch the usually faceless villains. While Snyder always speeds up and slows down motion in alternating fashion, at least it's less of that shaky cam BS that's becoming a bad unhealthy trend, allowing you to gawk at (ahem) the intricately designed action piece at hand.<br/><br/>As a guilt trip, Sucker Punch delivers that knock out blow in having found the right mix of eye candy cast after some musical chairs casting with actresses dropping out and others back filling, and ultimately it's a job well done. This marks something original that Snyder has done for the first time in his career - his other film projects have always been adaptations of sorts - and while he had created an imaginary world, it's the stunningly beautiful flowing visuals that create more of an impact than the strength of the story, but kudos though that he had the guts to turn things around in the final act which does surprise a little instead of being the all protective creator unwilling to let go.<br/><br/>Just as a side, for some reason I'm seeing a lot of Superman potential in this one that reminisces of the Max Fleischer animated series, with the kinda kinetic energy that Snyder is known to pump up his action sequences, and the narrative design to tell the story of the Last Son of Krypton and frankly I'm a tad bit excited to see Snyder's print over a Christopher Nolan-David Goyer story idea."

"RCWjr","9","12","26","25 March 2011"," There is no middle ground here....
","You are either going to love this film or hate it. There will be no middle ground with it. I absolutely loved it.<br/><br/>The story is simple; a young girl, Babydoll, is sent to a sanitarium by her uncle to keep her locked away. See, Babydoll and her sister were to inherit their mother's estate. But their uncle ceases control after Babydoll tragically kills her sister trying to defend them from her uncle. Baby doll creates a world within the sanitarium, a bordello, which she and the other girls live. Within that world she has another place she can go, a world for fighting. Each time she goes to the world, the backdrop is different; ancient China, WWII, Medieval and other worldly. Through these worlds, Babydoll and Co. fight their way to freedom.<br/><br/>Warning right up front, the film is chocked full of symbolism. The more you catch, the further into the film you will be. The imagery is absolutely fantastic. Another thing to get out of the way right off, yes, the girls are great looking. But all honesty, you get over that within a few minutes. There is so much going on, you get sucked into the story and their plight so hard, you forget about how they are dressed. For those critics who have spent time admonishing the seeming fetish fantasy overload, totally missed the point. I will let you experience the film and figure out for yourself what the outfits symbolize.<br/><br/>Scott Glenn enters the story at the beginning of each fight. He is there to instruct the girls and impart wisdom. Again, his presence is there for a reason, it is up to you to figure out the intent of his presence. Glenn is fantastic and is far more important to the film than I thought he would be. The continual symbolism makes this film fun because each person can bring something away that others might not have. Snyder obviously has his intentions, but ultimately he gives you just enough so that you can create the world a long with Babydoll.<br/><br/>All of the cast is great, not one person can you say doesn't bring their A-game to the proceedings. Emily Browning shoulders the lion share of time on screen and she is up to the task. Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, Jamie Chung, and Carla Gugino are wonderful. It is a shame many will dismiss their characters because of the clothes and setting. I can't for the life of me understand the criticism I have read from reviewers who say the film lacks soul. These ladies, to each one, bring you into the story and make you care beyond the guns and mayhem. <br/><br/>There is a lot of music that accompanies each scene. A mix of score and soundtrack music really sets the scenes. Snyder does an excellent job picking songs which have lyrical content in step with the scene, many times serving as the narrator.<br/><br/>I can't say enough good things about this film. It was right in my wheel house. It hit all the right beats and surpassed my expectations, which were raised through the trailers. It will not be for everyone, it will be a film that divides friends. That is the best kind of film that can create reactions on both sides. The worse thing that can be said about a film that it elicits no kind of reaction, this is not that kind of film."
"cooljam2000","5","13","29","24 March 2011"," A typical Zach Snyder film: 1/3 slow motion, 1/3 pointless over-the-top action, and 1/3 comic book styled visuals and storytelling
","This is only my second review ever but Sucker Punch ground my gears so much that I just had to make this review. I saw this movie Wednesday the 23rd in St. Louis at an early screening for press and locals and I will be avoiding major spoilers but might mention some small scene specific things.<br/><br/>Basically, this movie is what you get when Zack Snyder turns all of his little girl fetish fantasies/daydreams into a movie. The action is unbelievably over-the-top, too long, and boring. The girls, while beautiful, look rather young and childish (especially the main girl Baby Doll) in what can only be seen as a pedophilia-type fetish. The story and visuals are similar to a comic book with there being a constant narration and a stylized darkish tint to everything like 300 or The Spirit. Since this movie does follow a comic book style of story telling and goes in and out of reality, the plot ends up being very jarring and confusing especially at critical story points throughout the movie.<br/><br/>One of the biggest problems with this movie is length, clocking in at nearly 2 hours long. I enjoy long movies, if they are good. If a movie is good I want it to go on forever and never end, but with Sucker Punch I couldn't wait for it to finish. Probably the biggest contributing factor to the length of this movie is the slow motion. Roughly 1/3rd of Sucker Punch is in slow motion (that is if you cut out all the scenes that weren't in slow motion, the running time of just the slow motion scenes would be about 35-40 minutes) including the first 10 minutes of the film which is completely in slow motion. The next biggest contributor were the action scenes. Not only were they too long that you got bored of them after a few minutes (and not to mention the fact that all the action scenes were exactly the same for every fantasy sequence no matter who they were fighting) but they were so over-the-top that they just weren't entertaining. The girls were always impervious to damage (falling 1,000 feet or getting hit by 100 foot tall robots didn't even phase them) and had matrix-type skills to dodge bullets. There just wasn't any suspense or excitement to the action.<br/><br/>Another problem with this movies the the CGI. About half the movie is in CGI and poor CGI at that. While some of the CGI looks good, specifically larger shots with most things in the distance, when it gets close up to some things it looks like a cutscene from a video game (maybe that was what he was going for though). It really takes you out of the movie.<br/><br/>The only good actor is Jon Hamm, and he has the smallest part in the film. The lead female cast are emotionless and Carla Gugino has a laughably bad Russian accent. Character wise, Gugino's character is pointless and could be removed from the film without anything missing, Hamm's character is basically just a cameo even though his character is made out to be a big deal, the main female cast are static and don't change (Baby Doll pretty much does everything, one girl is the naive rebellious one, another is the strong-willed reluctant one, one is the Asian girl who is always dealing with technology like piloting giant mech robots, and the other is Vanessa Hudgens who does absolutely nothing except look ridiculous with her giant hair). The main antagonist does have some good moments (especially one near the end when he does something you wish he would have done right from the beginning) but other than that he and the rest of the bad guys are dull or non-existent for most of the film.<br/><br/>The one thing that could have made this movie slightly enjoyable was nudity. This movie is constantly teasing you by showing all of the girls in very skimpy skin tight outfits and in their dressing room a lot (where most of their conversations take place) but there is no nudity at all. It is just a big tease with a huge letdown once you realize you won't get to see any skin. I'm not giving this movie a lower rating because of the lack of nudity (I knew it was a PG-13 movie), but because it is being teased so much and sex is hinted at or implied a lot it could have included some sex scenes and nudity and not cheapened the story or the film at all and maybe could have even strengthened the story and what the girls were going through.<br/><br/>This movie just proves Zack Snyder is a terrible film maker. Because he had butchered source material so much in his previous films to try to make things different and his own, you might think that giving him his very own original movie might let him really show his creativity. But as you can tell by the crap he adds or changes to the source material in his previous movies, he has no good ideas of his own. Sucker Punch is just a bunch of random CGI and cock-teasing with a very simple but not very coherent story and unnecessary action."

","Went to see this film with my girlfriend who to be honest she wasn't looking forward to it. I had seen trailer and thought it looked excellent and being a fan of Zak Snyder was expecting a lot from it. On entering cinema and taking our seats I did notice two old men sitting in front of us (you can guess what they where there to see). It did deliver with an orgy of action which was pleasing to the eye especially with an all female cast rather than the usual male dominated action flicks. <br/><br/>The problem is I could see why some people might find the story hard to follow with most if not all the action being played out in the mind of the lead girl Baby doll. <br/><br/>It also had the look of a computer game at times with added slow-mo which I find appealing as effects and CGI can be hard to make out when moving fast (Spider man 3 shame on you).<br/><br/>Overall I would recommend this film not to anyone (girl friend fell asleep) but mostly men and young teens looking for some eye candy and tons of action. I look forward now with confidence for Zak Snyders version of Superman Man Of Steel"

","... but I just couldn't. Escapism? I love video games, fantasy, comics and all number of geeky things(including mindless viewing of naked women), but just couldn't escape how nothing really connected at all. One massive discombobulation! I was constantly being slapped in the face with reasons why almost every scene just did not work. Visually? yes pretty stunning, but when I realize what I'm seeing, its just irritating. The sound and dialogue were the worst next to the story telling and acting. Except for the Kid Rock(ewww)& Queen(yay) song mashing collaboration, all of the other numbers picked for the score were really good, originally recorded that is! These are some of the worst song covers I can remember, some of which were sang by the protagonist as well to insult your ears.<br/><br/>I'm sure fans of this film will think that I just don't get the concepts, but the concepts are very very obvious.... impossible to even try and ignore, so its definitely not ""over my head"" or anything. This is Eye candy, a visually overwhelming disaster that sounds like .... uh... whatever you don't like the sound of! Wish I could have just turned off the stereo at the movie grill and tried to enjoy it in silence.<br/><br/>Surely individuals concerned about gender roles and sexism will be thoroughly insulted by this stew pot of total over sexualized murder, rape and abuse.<br/><br/>PS its always a special tragedy when a great Beatles song is butchered, in my worthless opinion."
"Tweetienator","9","6","11","24 June 2017"," Phantastic and Visionary
","After all those BIG disappointments lately (American Gods, The Mist, King Arthur, King Kong, The Wall, Lala Land etc. etc.) I more and more rewatch movies I like a lot. One of those ""new classics"" for me is Sucker Punch - a movie which promotes fighting girls (a year before Hunger Games and the inflation of men beating up girls and women hit the screen), it has stunning visuals and a story - if you care - that gives you a lot of material to think about, on top you get a certain tone of melancholia which is just superb. <br/><br/>Zack Snyder got at least three masterworks in his line: his version of the classic Dawn of the Dead, 300, and Sucker Punch - these movies beat easy everything Hollywood calls nowadays Blockbuster and tries to sell us - 2016 and till now 2017 are filled with disappointing bad or at most mediocre and certainly redundant outputs of the once called dream-factory: Hollywood needs to learn to dream again, and what I mean is not dreaming about making big easy cash with generic and bloodless products and big names, whose emptiness is disguised by the CGI-department (which is the only part of the filming industry that seems to make a - positive - progress). Not to forget all this primitive implemented liberal p.c.-schrott - how it is well done shows a movie like The Rocky Horror Picture Show from 1975. <br/><br/>But I guess nowadays the possession of a notebook and the will to spill one's mediocrity over the world is enough to meet the qualifications to get a job as a scriptwriter (besides the ""right"" left ""liberal"" state of ""mind"") - real imagination and skill are a very rare thing in these modern times. Sucker Punch belongs (imo) to the master league of modern fantastic and visionary movie-making: Matrix, Fight Club, Sin City, Pan's Labyrinth and a few other triumphant works of (more) recent years."
"colt-sliva","8","6","11","29 November 2013"," The best movie you'll hate
","This movie is fantastic. From a filmmakers point of view it is an artist practicing their craft in its full potential. The movie has theme, texture, a social influence, feeling, and power. This is the sort of thing that an auteur can take and realize to its full potential. Zack Snyder is not dumb. If I have one thing to say about the movie it would be this -<br/><br/>Zack Snyder (and a few hundred others) made something pretty cool and you should see it.<br/><br/>There seems to be this idea that Hollywood as an entity fails to create anything new. Sequels are constant and the remakes come in multitudes. Suckerpunch is something new. Remember people, new is good. Change is cool.<br/><br/>There is also the idea that Hollywood promotes common society beliefs. Things like patriarchy, fitting in, and capitalism. This movie goes against some of these things. This is probably a good thing. For those who fight for it, life has a flavor the sheltered will never know."
"Al_The_Strange","10","6","11","12 May 2013"," ""If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything.""
","As it likely is with most young men, I've always craved a certain type of excitement in cinema. That often includes overblown computer-animated environments, crazy-fast fight scenes with gratuitous slow-motion, and a cast of hot girls kicking a lot of butt! As you can probably tell from the movie's cover, Sucker Punch offers all of these things, following in a whole generation of similarly gratuitous and brainless entertainment. There are four major segments in which the film delves into an imaginative and creative landscape where all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>This only begs the question, so what? Where's the story and the substance? Most folks will argue that this film doesn't have a good story or good characters, and that the plot is merely a hollow shell to showcase the over-the-top action scenes. Others have taken offense to its portrayal of women being abused by the male characters.<br/><br/>Frankly, I don't agree with these assessments. If anything, the movie may have been too effective in dazzling the audience with its fantasy segments; if you look past them, there are deeper levels to the story. Without the action scenes, it's primarily a drama, full of vulnerable characters struggling to escape a desperate situation. With the action scenes, it's a play on what's real and what's not. Given the twist at the end of the movie, all layers of reality are sewn together with some rather intriguing parallels. It may not make total sense at first, but on repeat viewings, I've picked up on many subtle details that make the levels work sublimely together. Whether or not it (and the characters) really resonate with the audience will vary from person to person, and this will always remain a love-it-or-hate-it film.<br/><br/>For those who wish to look deeper into the film, you might find that the film reaches past the screen and tries to invoke you in some way. Some believe that it's a parallel to living life in general. I believe it's a criticism of the Hollywood studio system, with the dancers representing filmmakers and the male characters forcing them to produce fantasies of their choice. Regardless of how you look at it, the message is clear; the film asks you to fight for what you believe in.<br/><br/>As to what the film's title really means, I'm sure it'll differ from person to person. The plot sucker-punches you with its twists and turns. If you see a message in the film, maybe it'll hit you like a sucker punch. If you wind up hating the film and finding no redeeming value whatsoever, then I guess you've been sucker-punched.<br/><br/>Cinematically, the film is very slick and stylish, with lots of smooth photography and editing. The action segments feature loads of slow-motion and CGI effects; everything in-between utilizes a very cool color scheme and a lot of unusual camera angles. Acting can be a mixed bag; I didn't mind Emily Browning as Babydoll, but I didn't care for Abbie Cornish playing Sweet Pea. Oscar Isaac, Carla Gugino, and Scott Glenn are not bad in their roles. Every other performance here is serviceable. Writing is pretty strong, with enough distinctive and interesting dialogue to invoke some thought and feeling. The production value is high, featuring lots of slick and decent sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music, while not original, is pretty darn cool.<br/><br/>5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)"
"xenos-248-550733","8","6","11","9 May 2013"," A great action movie to watch!
","I watched this movie two years after its release mostly due to the low IMDb score. Usually this metric is a good indication of which movies to avoid, but I think ""crowd judgment"" fails in this case. That's why I wrote my first ever review for this one. <br/><br/>Sucker Punch is a action/fantasy movie. And if you view it as just what it is, then this is a great movie. Zack Snyder creates powerful images and action scenes that had a hidden choreography. The camera is distant from the actors and traditional acting is intentionally minimized. It's a bright new concept of action movies, quite different from many similar ones and I expect to generate polarized emotions and critics. It's a movie to love or hate, but definitely not an average one. Zack Snyder doesn't emphasize on characters and on faces. Acting might seem a little stiff, but my guess is that it is intentional and doesn't affect the outcome.Sucker Punch is all about images and action. With such images it could be a great movie without even a scenario (and we all have seen great action movies that have almost no scenario), but surprisingly the scenario is smart and I loved the idea of a dream within a dream.<br/><br/>Overall I loved the movie and I think is one of the most underrated ones here!"

However, it is still a ravishing visual spectacle, guided by a magnificent feminine bombshell cast and accompanied by an electrically dynamic soundtrack.<br/><br/>The problem is that these elements are unable to delete the sensation of a story sometimes told in a 'videoclip' manner and the ''300'' director on a autopilot mode, only concerned with the film's aesthetic outlook.<br/><br/>Despite that narrative ellipsis, this is a perfect Sunday afternoon popcorn flick, presenting itself as a delirium 'video game' crossing between ''The Matrix'' and ''Charlie's Angels''.

"Rinette","8","6","11","29 May 2011"," Love it, hate it, get it, don't.
","(*This review may contain spoilers*)<br/><br/>I have not seen much of Zack Snyder's work before, but I seriously enjoyed this movie and I think he did a brilliant job. It is fantasy. It is bad ass. It not meant to be realistic. It is a result of pure imagination and beautiful girls that kick ass - and that concept seems to be eluding many critics out there.<br/><br/>The movie revolves primarily around a girl known only as, 'Babydoll'. After the traumatic event (orchestrated by her shady stepfather) of her mother's death, followed by her sister's, she is institutionalised. It is unclear how this happens, be it by shady dealings between the stepfather and the boss of the asylum, 'Blue', or if she really has broken. It seems to be both, because as the next scene begins, so does the audience's experience of her desperate and imaginative psyche. She is determined to escape, and she enrols the help of the other girls in the asylum to do it.<br/><br/>Visually, this movie is a treat. The cinematography and structure are fantastic, the use of metaphors and parallels was a genius move, and the battle scenes very well done and exciting to watch. It appears to be set in present time, but with definite links and hints to the past - especially the asylum and it's brothel-like set-up, not to mention the futuristic Nazi-style German soldiers - and an almost anime/cartoon element to the costume, weaponry, and colouring. It's not a masterpiece by any standards, but the performances were very good, and you do feel for the characters and become involved - more so with Babydoll than the others, but that is because you know more about her. Little more is learnt about the others. Special notice should be paid to the music in the film - the soundtrack. It was incredible, and went a long way to making the movie. I had chills.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a fantastic adventure filled with imagination, fantasy and fight scenes. Harmless, but nevertheless impressive fun I would watch again and again."

","Sucker Punch, one of the most interesting movies that ever hit the silver screen. The movie really captured the crowd's attention with its it uniqueness of story, unbelievable effects and great directing. Though might not be called an ""Oscar"" movie, its twist and turns definitely leaves you talking about it. Aside from its noteworthy plot, the movie also shows values of courage, independence, friendship, self-sacrifice and many more. It's imaginative director, Zack Snyder,and all the other people who worked behind the scenes really took their audience to another world. Of course, a movie is not a movie without the actors and actresses and, for me at least, they were very good. Sucker Punch is the kind of movie you want to watch with your friends or siblings because it really exemplified being there for each other and working as a team. To those people who said they did not understand the movie, I suggest watching it again and this time only focus on the movie and I assure you will see its magnificence. I recommend this movie to everyone."
"giantjoebot","1","8","16","23 June 2011"," I felt like I had just been lobotomized by this movie
","I'm not sure where to begin. <br/><br/>This movie is like a really long music video, and a bad one at that. Think Linkin Park mixed with Lady Gaga, for 2 hours straight. The sound track is great, but they are all cover songs, and nothing original. I think the music in the movie was the only good thing.<br/><br/>The action scenes are like watching someone play a video game. Actually I think that watching someone play a video game might be more entertaining than watching this movie. <br/><br/>Things that are wrong with the plot. Fist off last will and testaments are not kept in peoples desk, they are kept by a lawyer. Second, she would not have been taken to a mental hospital by her step father in an incident like that. She would have been taken there by the police. Third, there seemed to be no police investigation whatsoever.<br/><br/>The main character, always seems to fight, and then give up at the end just before she is about to win. She fought to escape out the window and get a gun, and then look how that turned out. Then she does the same thing through the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The main character, baby doll, looks just like that, a doll. Her face does not move. She looks fake, as in to much plastic surgery, so much that her face can't move. Or maybe its the anorexia, because the only fat that a saw on that girl was in her lips, and I wonder if that's real or something else.<br/><br/>All and all, I was really looking forward to this movie after seeing the trailer, but after watching it I feel like my IQ just dropped. No honestly, my brain feels foggy. This is not a movie that makes you think, its a movie that kills brain cells."

","It is possible that this is the worst film has ever been made. It is almost certainly the worst film I have ever seen. <br/><br/>Its difficult to spend the required 10 lines to describe this film because the script could probably be written in that little text. As far as I can tell this film is designed to appeal to the video game playing teenage boy who cant get a girl friend. The film shoves some nice looking girls in some stockings, give them guns and get them to shoot stuff. In principle this sounds fun but then they ruin the boy pleasing element by getting them to cry quite a lot, and the action bit is nothing particularly special anyway. Tedious.<br/><br/>In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, its two hours of my life I will never see back. Save your money and watch the Matrix on DVD instead."

Zack S must be one of the best young directors around, but you couldn't tell from this trashy offering. I thought, at least it should be better than Battle:LA. Right? Well actually it's probably on par. Both have poor scripts, both have poor acting, both have taken my money. When being robbed, i like to be hit across the back of the head and told ""this is a stick up"". Nowadays, they just show you a great trailer and slog you at the box office. Heartless Bastards.

"raieltoo","9","8","16","26 March 2011"," Dive into the Imagination
","It's an excellent visual and musical adventure: a cross between Inception, Labyrinth, and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. No David Bowie, but it is pretty dark and bleak. It is an atypical movie that uses music and strange visuals to convey emotion, not unlike a music video. Despite many critics being unable to see beyond their preconceptions of how filmmaking should be done, I have to rate this film an amazing success. I admit, I felt the sucker punch but rolled with it (yes, it will throw layers of reality at you without warning).<br/><br/>I only offer that if there hadn't been pressure to keep the running time moderate and the rating to a PG-13, then Sucker Punch could have perhaps resonated even more strongly with viewers. Yet as the movie appears to be largely from Baby Doll's perspective, spending more time in ""reality"" to develop other characters more would perhaps have been counter to the film's theme. After all, what we are treated to is her perception of reality that she uses to deal with the horrible events occurring to her.<br/><br/>It is a vivid journey through the imagination of a girl attempting to escape horrible realities, such as the dehumanization of children and the enslavement of women. Therefore, we journey into alternating realities where on one hand, women are treated as objects, and on the other hand, where they are empowered. So if you are willing to travel into the id with a girl brave enough to fight against oppression, authority figures, and abusers, don't hesitate to do so. However, be prepared to battle dragons."

I could not keep track of what imaginary world the character was in, the more it went on the more confused I was. The actors over dramatized everything and that dumb accent that Carla Gugino had as a Russian or whatever doctor was like watching a Mad TV skit.

"princebansal1982","3","9","19","4 July 2011"," Sci-Fi Guilty Pleasure which could have been much better
","Zack Snyder's latest venture is surely something to look at. It seems that he did an internet poll for gamers, sci-fi fans, geeks etc and then made the movie tailor-made for them. Its got steam-punk, ninja warriors, dragons, planes and last but not the least babes. Action is just breathtaking in some scenes. For a gamer like me there are hints of Mortal Combat and Unreal Tournament and everything else I wanted.<br/><br/>Story idea is decent. The main protagonist is Baby Doll who is a mental patient in a facility. But she imagines it as a kind of sleazy club where girls dance for the customers and then the customers can use those girls. And when she starts dancing she imagines it as elaborate fight scenes in a different world. So it is a fantasy with in a fantasy, and the three layers overlap. <br/><br/>Now for the cons. The only thing missing is a strong connection between the actors and the audience. We see them going through the motions but we never root for them. We just love some action scenes and the rest seems like background noise. Sucker Punch works more in parts rather than as a whole. And the disappointment you feel is more because of missed opportunities. With a better script and better actors it could have become a sci-fi classic. Instead it is just a summer blockbuster."

"karmiccourage","7","10","22","29 March 2011"," It's Sweet Pea's story, not Baby Doll's.
","Hero's Journey, developed by Joseph Campbell, is a list of common elements in mythic storytelling. Here's the Sucker Punch breakdown. <br/><br/>ORDINARY WORLD – The main character is not Baby Doll (the blonde in the Sailor Moon outfit) our main character is Sweet Pea. We establish Sweet Pea's ordinary world in the ""Theater."" The theater is a lounge inside the mental institution where the Polish doctor plays music to allow the girls reenact their problems. The head of the facility, ""Blue,"" talks about how their reenactments are so real (hence a set up for the worlds we will enter). Sweet Pea is on stage of the theater, she comes down to have a face-to-face with Baby Doll thus showing us the ordinary world for the girls. The music plays and for the rest of the movie we are in the imagination on Sweet Pea. It's Sweet Pea that creates a world where the girls are not mental patients but dancing strippers with a pimp boss and a dance coach. This world is safer for Sweet Pea. It's in the world that Sweet Pea is the top dancer, but then Baby Doll arrives. CALL TO ADVENTURE – Baby Doll is our conduit for this call to adventure. When Baby Doll is asked to dance, she transitions to world in her mind (Sweet Pea is still the puppeteer of all this) where she finds ""Wise Man"" When asked what Baby Doll wants, she says, ""Freedom."" The Wiseman tells her that a ""High Roller"" is coming for Baby Doll in 5 days. Therefore giving a sense of urgency. The Wiseman gives her tools – a gun and a sword – and tells her she needs to find 5 items (map, fire, knife, a key and a fifth to be discovered later) to gain her freedom. Thus setting up the plot points of the movie. REFUSAL TO CALL – Baby Doll tells the girls of this encounter. Sweet Pea doesn't want to go on this journey and makes the girls agree that if she wants to call it off they will. Why? because she's the main character, and in this format, that is what they do. MEETING THE MENTOR + CROSSING THE LINE OF THE ORDINARY WORLD INTO THE SPECIAL WORLD – this happens when Baby Doll does her dance and Sweet Pea steals the map to the Mental Institution/Brothel. The entrance to this special world is actually special. When Baby Doll closes her eyes when she begins to dance she is now transported to a WWII/steampunk/Prussian War type place where all the girls must fight these mechanical Germans to get the map. In the special world is where Sweet Pea meets the mentor, ""Wiseman."" TESTS, ALLIES AND ENEMIES – This can be boiled down in to gaining the items needed for the quest, they get the map from the office of the Mental Institution, the fire from the Mayor's lighter, the knife proves harder <br/><br/>***WARNING Spoilers***<br/><br/>ORDEAL, DEATH and REBIRTH –Baby Doll dances for the cook to get the knife when the dance goes crappy because water shorts out the electrical cord to the song before Sweet Pea gets the knife. The cook realizes what's she doing and Rocket get's stabbed and killed. Amber does get away with the knife. Before Rocket dies, she tells Sweet Pea to tell their parents that she's sorry for running away. Sweet Pea is locked away in a closet. Blondie cracks and tells Blue the girl's plans. Now it's the day of the ""High Roller"" and the girls need the 4th and 5th item to gain freedom. REWARD, SEZING THE SWORD – Blue kills a couple of the girls, and tries to rape Baby Doll. Here's the problem – It should be Sweet Pea who comes and saves the day getting the last item – the key around Blue's neck. But it isn't. Baby Doll overcomes her fear of Blue and stabs Blue with the knife before grabbing the key around his neck. Baby Doll then frees Sweet Pea. This is a confusion of who's story we are watching. THE ROAD BACK -reality of the mental institution and the imaginary world of the brothel start to intersect here. Baby Doll and Sweet Pea are the only ones alive of the girls. They use the map to know how to escape, the lighter to start a fire in a closet that will trigger some of the doors to open, the knife was already used against Blue, and then the key opens all the locks. There is a clue that we're getting closer to reality as we see the front door operator looks like the ""Mayor"" that Baby Doll danced for. Outside the Mental institution there are men waiting to enter the brothel. Confusing but convenient. RESURRECTION- At the front gate, Baby Doll realized what the fifth item needed to escape is – her. Baby Doll says to Sweet Pea, ""This isn't my story, it's yours."" In Sweet Pea's imagination it's Baby Doll who is the last item needed for her safety, hence why the story started in the theater and Sweet Pea's introduction. Baby Doll dances and distracts the guys as Sweet Pea escapes. RETURN WITH THE ELIXIR – Sweet Pea boards a bus driven by the Wiseman to Fort Wayne, Indiana. She doesn't have a ticket and the Wiseman says something really cool that I can't remember. The reason why I can't remember it is because I live not far from Fort Wayne and I think it's funny that that is where she's escaping too. But the meaning is that Sweet Pea is going to return home to tell her parents that Rocket really did love them and didn't mean to run away. Therefore, in my mind, giving it the message of forgiveness.<br/><br/>Like it, love it or hate it, Sucker Punch does follow the Hero's Journey of mythic storytelling with only 1 misstep.

","This is probably the most underrated movie of all time. If there ever was such a thing as critic-collectivism wherein everyone just follows everyone else, then this movie is evidence of that. Most reviews I've read I just shake my head at wondering if they even saw the movie.<br/><br/>I even saw a few self-proclaimed ""feminists"" complaining that this film is very shallow, violent, and degrading towards women, those folk definitely did not see this movie. If you watch this movie and think such things, and I am sorry if this sound pretentious, but if so you really need to start using your brain.<br/><br/>This is a brilliant, very intellectual movie that deals with escapism, dream scenarios and it speaks a lot in metaphor. To me very similar to Donnie Darko, another movie I love. <br/><br/>People watching and loving things like Transformers and Justice League might not enjoy this movie. I also understand that the tone of this movie within a deep metaphoric world will not appeal to all, but hot darn this is definitely for those of you loving psychology, deep thoughts, intelligent stories and escapism. Before Snyder ruined BvS, which is one of the worst movies ever made, and before he helped mess up Justice League, he did make the really good Watchmen and this unsung masterpiece. <br/><br/>This is a movie that definitely belongs on a top 20 movies of all time list. A 9/10, and highly recommended."

","""Sucker Punch"" ain't no movie. ""Sucker Punch"" is an excess of testosterone vomited into a reel of celluloid until it is violently splashed into the faces of its audience. The movie's advertisements are diligent in declaring its promise: ""You will be unprepared."" They were right. I was not prepared for the overwhelming atrocity that I had to bear during the course of its running time. By the movie's end, I felt that my senses had been pummeled to dust.<br/><br/>The plot, if that's what you call it, is this: A grieving girl who has just lost her mother has been framed by her stepfather for murder, and is now imprisoned in a mental institution. A lobotomy awaits her. So, in the meantime, she creates a fantasy world of her own. Within that fantasy world, she creates another fantasy world. That's twice the fantasy. It's kinda like ""Inception"", only stupid.<br/><br/>The girl's fantasy actually belongs to Zack Snyder, writer and director. One of his most popular films is ""300"", a movie where its heroes wage war wearing nothing but a cape and their underwear, so the enemy could marvel at the sight of their abs, and get distracted. In ""Sucker Punch"", five young women charge into battles with their short skirts and high heels. In the fantasy world, the second one, the girls are against kamikaze robot bombers, blazing angry dragons, giant samurais, and, of course, a few hundred steam-powered Nazi zombies. Movies by Zack Snyder aren't about what's rational or comprehensible. Reaching its truest form in ""Sucker Punch"", Snyder makes movies to share with the world, his imagination, which was the vomit I was talking about earlier.<br/><br/>Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/sucker-punch-movie-review/"

","I'm noticing a pattern with all of Snyder's movies... Rape. He obviously must have some fetish, or he thinks most men have this fetish, but we do not. I think you can have gorgeous girls dressed up and kicking &$$ without brutalizing them in order to get them to respond in a vigilante style fantasy world. I can't tell you how many girls I've dated that had been abused in that fashion, nor was it sexy or fun for me to deal with the after effects of that abuse. I go to a movie like this to escape reality, not be reminded of it. I know the nerdy anime/manga crowd loves big breasted 12 year old girls being brutalized by tentacles or evil generals, but it's not sexy, nor is it funny or cute. You nerds would know this if you ever had a gf. That being said I enjoyed 300, as did I enjoy Watchmen (to my surprise), but enough with the brutalization of women already. I question the type of psychological stability in a mind that continually goes to rape in his portrayal of women. You had me with hot girls kicking &$$ in a beautiful fantasy world, but you lost me when you crapped all over women yet again and reminded me of how messed up this world is. Is Superman going to be a deadbeat dad rapist in the new movie? Is it because nerds can't get girls that their entertainment has to involve taking it forcefully? Tone it down a bit and you've got something that can appeal to men everywhere. Movies are supposed to be an escape from reality."

It stinks from the start where you have a hard time trying to figure out the changes where movie tells the real world and where fantasy begins. Musics are just there because they apparently thought a movie should have musics on its background. Thema changes so fast both for musics and and for storytelling it literally tells you :""THIS MOVIE CONTAINS PRETTY GIRLS AND MEANINGLESS VISUAL EFFECTS TO MAKE PEOPLE WATCH"". Visual effects are meaningless because you feel to the core that they are there to fill the great hole that scenarists couldn't fill. They took random historical events, some mythological creatures/characters apparently because they thought It would look cool with the effects. This is an insult to those who try to put a good movie before the audience. If you have little respect for good-movie makers and If you have little respect to yourself don't pay for this movie."

","First of all, why was it called Sucker Punch? That name didn't seem to make any sense to me unless I missed something.<br/><br/>I say this to everyone I mention this film to. If you do go and see it, only go for the intro. It's the best bit and I must say, some of the best editing of picture and soundtrack I've seen in ages. Only because that part seemed to have any form of character development. Other than that, I think the writer thought, 'Well, Baby Doll's introduced. Let's just have the others spring up out of nowhere'. That's pretty much what happens.<br/><br/>There is another great scene in the film as well. It's called the end credits.<br/><br/>This film was too SFX dependent in my eyes. Obvious references to films and games were abundant as well. Even with an extremely cringe worthy western style reference when one of the girls died. The whole 'Tell Mama I love her' crap.<br/><br/>The plot was that Baby Doll wanted to escape and four other girls thought 'I'll go with you'. They needed five items. A map, fire (a lighter), a key, something else that I forget, and the final one is a mystery that turns out to be Baby Doll herself. How the hell she realised that in the end, I don't know.<br/><br/>Major plot holes in this film.<br/><br/>DON'T WATCH IT UNLESS YOU'RE DOING IT ONLINE!!!"

"AlessiaGiangia","9","5","9","1 May 2016"," Love it or hate it.
","Old people use to say ""truth is right in the middle"". Well, forget this motto when you're done with watching this movie, because you'll love it (like I do, lo-lo-love it like I do) or hate it (like most people seem to do). But why people hate this movie? I don't know, actually, because this movie does what a film is supposed to do: it amuses and teaches something. OK, maybe some people are shocked by the fact that some of the girls are kinda naked. But, hey, this movie is settled in a ""pleasure house"": of course women are kinda undressed. However the girls in this movie are sexy and there's a huge difference between sexy and undressed. The fact that unnerved some people is that this movie tries to be like a psycho-thriller or a psycho-movie (like Inception or Shutter Island, for example). Some scene, in fact, may recall those movies but this one is not like them, because it isn't plain or straight like the above-mentioned films: all in this movie is an enormous allegory of life and everything is symbolical. Let's think about the old man who teaches Babydoll how to escape from the mental hospital (or pleasure house), for example: he is an allegory of our inner force. Using this allegory system, Snyder has the opportunity to make clear references to some movies he likes: for example the first battle of Babydoll recalls Tarantino's Kill Bill, while the battle with the dragon is undoubtedly a reference to the fantasy genre. Concluding: this movie is a great movie, but it is not cinema of essay, since this movie has been made to entertain the audience, not to astound Juries at Festivals."
"A-Pseudo-Intellectual","Null","5","9","4 August 2012"," Say what you want, but I loved it.
","I want to start out by saying that this is hardly a 10/10 film. If you really want to look at the flaws, and the details, and all that, a 7 might be more fair. But, for whatever reason, I just loved this movie. So much so that I can forgive its flaws. <br/><br/>I'll get the issues out of the way first. The script. It's a bit messy, and there are more than a few bad lines. Also, two of the characters- Amber and Blondie- don't really have any place in the film, apart from giving us a really, really good scene towards the end (I won't give it away). Most (not quite all, but I won't name names) of the cast- particularly Oscar Isaac, Carla Gugino and Jena Malone- is great. The characters are a bit underdeveloped, and I would have liked to see more interaction between the girls, and some more background for each of them. Now onto the good. <br/><br/>This is a Zack Snyder movie. That much is very clear in every single frame. The saturated colors and stylized look are breathtaking, and the attention paid to detail (if you look closely, you'll see that the protagonist's entire story is engraved onto her sword) is remarkable. The music, as many others have said, feels like a character in the film. Each track is perfectly chosen, and it pulls us in and out of different levels of Babydoll's fantasy seamlessly. The CGI landscapes are beautiful and detailed, and the fight choreography is simply spectacular. It's like watching an intricate and well-oiled machine go to work. I had to just sit back and marvel at it all.<br/><br/>From the opening scene, where the camera flies through about five minutes of powerful, non-verbal storytelling, I was hooked. It's a great movie to just lose yourself in. After several viewings, it becomes evident that Sucker Punch is actually a good bit smarter than you'd expect. There are lots of Buddhist themes- the whole premise of the movie is the pursuit of true freedom, whatever that may be, and what it takes to find it. The action sequences are like meditation, as Babydoll learns to control her mind and defeat her personal demons (which appear in the forms of zombies, dragons, and robots, among other things.) Towards the end of each sequence, Babydoll seems to gain supernatural powers, as she pulls off something fantastic- because she has, after all, mastered her own mind. There's also some clever social satire. The advertisements tried to bring people in with scantily clad girls beating the crap out of monsters. In the beginning, we see one of these scantily clad girls as she loses her mother, her sister, is almost raped by her stepfather, is sent to a mental institution, and, right as she's about to be lobotomized, another character literally stands up and yells ""STOP! This is a joke, right? I get the sexy little school girl. I even get the helpless mental patient; that can be hot. But what is this? Lobotomized vegetable? Why don't we try something a bit more commercial?"" There's the sucker punch. It didn't play by the rules. A big theme of the film is the objectification of women. Towards the end, when SPOILER ALERT the villain succeeds in 'objectifying' a girl by lobotomizing her (turning her into a flesh-and-blood 'babydoll', he doesn't want her any more, because he's lost ""that undeniable spark that is you."" END SPOILERS<br/><br/>It's a guilty pleasure, pure and simple, but one with some very interesting themes. The critical bashing was more than unfair. Sucker Punch is spectacular, thrilling, breathtaking, beautiful, intense, and- most unexpectedly- emotionally involving. You'll love it or you'll hate it. Try to guess which category I fall under. 10/10."
"joannegoldsmith","9","5","9","29 June 2012"," TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY, Do NOT be Deterred by some of the Negative Reviews for this film!
","I'm staggered to see just how many bad reviews there are on here for 'Sucker Punch' - mostly people complaining that this film is all special effects with no substance or character development. <br/><br/>But they're wrong. This film is leagues better than 300, and it annoys me to see people trying to tar this film with the '300, all style no depth' brush just because its directed by Zack Snyder, the same director. <br/><br/>To truly appreciate this film, you have to totally let go, as it is steeped in multiple perceptions, realities and metaphor. The best way I can describe it is as a cross between Sin City and Inception, with a hint of a Scott-pilgrim-esque edge thrown in as well. I've read lots of reviews that argue that the characters don't get explored in enough depth, that you never really 'connect' with the main character on an emotional level. But I totally disagree, and I suspect those that argue this were perplexed by the surreal nature of the film, and were unable to appreciate it fully because they were holding on too tightly to their interpretations of the literal, rather than what was actually transpiring in the story. <br/><br/>I'm not going to give anything away - all I can say is that by the end of the film, I felt deep empathy with several of the key characters in it, as well as the protagonist. <br/><br/>Also don't be put off by those saying it's 'sexism/objectification of women at its worst'. They obviously don't understand the world of alternative dress all that well, and immediately associate any attractively-put-together, female sci-fi warrior costumes as sexist, offensive and degrading, when in fact any fantasy fan appreciates that they represent the exact opposite. Because from where I was sitting YES, the main characters looked pretty sexy and provocatively dressed in several scenes, but they were also INCREDIBLY EMPOWERED. And this is from a strong minded young woman!<br/><br/>So all I can say is if you like sci fi, fantasy, and films with that something a little bit different, then Sucker Punch really is a film for you. I appreciate that Sucker punch isn't for everyone, but at the same time I can't help feel a little bit bad for anyone who's rated this film at any less than 5 stars - as they obviously find it extremely difficult to escape once in a while and let themselves go into the throngs of fantasy."
"jboothmillard","4","5","9","17 September 2011"," Sucker Punch
","From director Zack Snyder (Dawn of the Dead, 300, Watchmen), I had heard a relatively big hype about this film during the time of release, so despite seeing the rating after looking it up I was still keen to try it. Basically, set in 1961, after being sexually abused by and attacking her Stepfather (Gerard Plunkett), and accidentally killing her younger sister, twenty year old Baby Doll (Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events' Emily Browning) is placed in the Lennox House for the Mentally Insane. She is due to be lobotomised in five days, after the stepfather bribed orderly Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac) to forge the signature of psychiatrist Dr. Vera Gorski (Watchmen's Carla Gugino), this is so she cannot inform the authorities about her true circumstances. She is locked away with four other inmates and dancers, Amber (The Hangover Part II's Jamie Chung), Blondie (High School Musical's Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Donnie Darko's Jena Malone) and Rocket's sister Sweet Pea (Limitless's Abbie Cornish), and the all works as part of the team for the new inside brothel. Baby Doll is told by Blue that he is to become a dancer too and her virginity will be sold to the client called ""The High Roller"" (Jon Hamm), however he is actually the lobotomy doctor scheduled for her operation. It is while performing her first erotic dance that she finds herself able to imagine herself in a new fantasy world, meeting Wise Man (The Right Stuff's Scott Glenn), but this is also a representation of what is happening in moments for real, as he explains that if she desires to escape she must find four ""weapons"". Of course returning to the real institute world, where he dancing is highly praised, despite having no memory of it, she realises these four ""weapons"" she remembers from being admitted into the institute, they are tools for escape. So as time goes by she and her four new friends are on a mission to get these tools, which are a map to find all the routes and exits, fire (a lighter) to cause a distraction, a knife in case they run into trouble, and a key to unlock all the doors, but there is also an unrevealed fifth tool Baby Doll must find out. As each tool is collected by one or more of the girls and Baby Doll is seducing everyone with her mind blowing erotic dancing, we see her and the four girls in her fantasy world going on missions from the Wise Man, going against zombie Nazis to get a map (mirrored by Sweet Pea), invading an Orc filled castle to take the fire-breathing crystals from the throat of a dragon (mirrored by Amber), and going on a speeding train to stop a bomb (mirrored by Rocket). In the third fantasy mission Rocket sacrifices herself, and of course in the real world she is the one who gets stabbed and dies from an attack from the kitchen cook. When it looks like hope has gone and escape is not going to happen, they band back together and the final mission is not going into Baby Doll's fantasy world, she is the one who steals the key after a proper confrontation with Blue. After all the tools are put to use, and one by one the girls lose their lives during their attempt to escape, it is just Baby Doll and Sweet Pea remaining, but Baby Doll sacrifices herself and lets Sweet Pea get away. The final scene sees that Baby Doll has had her lobotomy operation, it appears that all the events just seen did happen, and Sweet Pea did manage to escape, but many of the events may have been in Baby Doll's imagination, and Sweet Pea is seen managing to get on a bus, with the Wise Man as the driver, and her final words are something about ""you"" (the audience) being the best weapon, and that ""You have all the weapons you need. Now fight."" All the female performers give good performances, I will admit the story could have been improved for bits and pieces, but overall it is not too bad, and the best things about is of course the inventive use of the fantasy world, brought to life by the great special effects, a reasonable and not terrible fantasy action adventure drama. Okay!"

"eddy223","10","5","9","13 May 2011"," Beautiful story
","This review might have a few spoilers!! This movie is beautiful! I noticed many reviews from PROFESSIONALS gave it really low score, saying the movie had no story and relied on amazing visuals to satisfy viewers. But this is entirely untrue. I wonder where these professional reviewers come from... if they cant even think hard enough and put the effort into understanding the deep meaning of the movie. This movie has kind of an Inception feel to it, where there's a dream within a dream. Whats actually going on is Babydoll and the other girls are in an insane asylum, and they get sexually abused by the wardens. The Doctor, i forgot her name, but shes the one who is the ""dance teacher"" in the burlesque dream, teaches the girls how to put themselves in happy thought to help them recover. This results in Babydoll aways imagining Action sequences when bad things happen. so, The burlesque world is an imagining of a better world because the asylum is horrible to her, and the action packed worlds are all when her and the girls are sexually abused, and instead of remembering and thinking about being sexually abused, she puts herself into that action world by ""dancing (getting molested)"" and ignoring her real surrounding and putting herself somewhere else. the movie is truly beautiful, The new york times and all those other newspapers and magazines really should consider looking for someone else to start reviewing movies."

"jonnyfendi","8","5","9","2 May 2011"," Mega Visual Feast
","Thiz movie is my most anticipated movie of the year and ends up exactly as I expected before. It's a mega visual feast that I have ever seen since ""The Matrix"" (1999). In the hand of Zack Snyder (Director), everything has reached to a new height of adrenaline rush. I'm talking about the visualization aspect here. Back in 2006 when ""300"" was booming, people kept questioning whether Snyder was only able to gather 300 muscular men to do those macho things? Well, now for the answer he brings us five sexy deadly ladies to fight against giant samurai and vicious dragon in alternative World War II! An innocent girl named Baby Doll (Emily Browning) is accused as a rebel and now placed in a mental hospital. In that place, she meets Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung). Together, they plan an escape route. To accomplish the mission, they have to collect five items which are a map, fire, a knife, a key and one last mysterious element. Emily Browning is perfectly Cast as Baby Doll, her character is so fragile and extremely lethal at the same time. Other Cast members worth mentioning here are Carla Gugino, Oscar Isaac, Jon Hamm and the most unforgettable appearance, Scott Glenn as the Wise Man. I love the opening scene so much which describes how Baby Doll is oppressed by her abusive stepfather, the sequence tells so effectively dramatic, dark comical and elegant. The camera movement is dynamic, the transition from one point to another is effective, and the music is perfect. Love every minute of it. For the ending, you might feel a little bit disappointed especially if you expect something more, but for me it is just perfect! The ending put us in a floating situation and makes you keep wondering even when you were walking out of the theater. I always enjoy the movie which can dive into a blur fantasy and reality world at the same time. And then explains cleverly what is the connection between them. Thiz kind of movie always utters some new hidden philosophy.

"jojjon_9","9","5","9","26 April 2011"," A surprisingly great movie, but why so many haters?
","I wasn't even interested in watching this movie first, a friend said he had a movie he wanted to see so I went to the cinema with him and another friend, knowing nothing at all about the movie except there would be some action and an asylum, in other words, I were not expecting much. Roughly two hours later I walked out of the cinema a happy man ready to die with no regrets.<br/><br/>What I don't understand is why so many people hate the movie, it's totally beyond me. I can see why some would dislike it, I mean, there are boring middle-aged people with a total lack of any sense of humor and self-satisfaction that spend their entire life talking negatively about everything as a means of going through their distasteful and disgusting everyday life. Sure, I can accept that, but hey! What are your arguments? Bad acting? Bad story? Story not making sense? To much special effects? Characters never in any real danger? Over the top? And the list just goes on like that song that doesn't end. <br/><br/>COME ON PEOPLE! Is it that hard to just enjoy a movie without constantly being on the lookout for every single flaw in someone else's work? I for one never thought any of the acting was bad, on the contrary I thought it was really good, it really felt like normal people. <br/><br/>And the story was according to me a lot like it's title, a bloody sucker punch, I mean, your mom gets murdered, you accidentally kill your sister and your greedy stepfather puts you in an asylum to get you lobotomized and that way inherit everything that would've been yours! <br/><br/>And about nothing making sense? Hellooooo, if you failed to notice it at the beginning, they are mental patients at a mental hospital and for all we know, she could've been mental for real. And things that happen in a mental patients mind is according to me okay to be a little distorted and messed up. Yeah sure, some things were left unexplained but simple cause of that I wouldn't bash it since I really really enjoyed it overall. Would you say inception sucked because in the end some things were left unexplained?<br/><br/>And to much special effects? Pffft... go home, swallow a whole bottle of pills, go to bed and wake up in the new world or not at all. Whilst I can appreciate movies without many special effects, I'm also very able to appreciate, and love, movies with special effects. The scenes with special effects are made to be really really ""special effected"", what did you expect?<br/><br/>The filming was great and the soundtrack was really mind blowing, and just because they made a bad cover on one of your ""oh so favorite Queen songs"" you don't have to hate the movie! I also found the cover quite bad but it still fit the scene! And all the others songs were just awesome!<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is one of the best I've seen in a really long time and easily should be somewhere between 7-8 but I'm going to rate it 10 in a desperate attempt to raise it's rating from the clutches of the people who should really be in an asylum who down-rates it horribly. I really feel sorry for you, maybe you should consider getting lobotomized, you'd be in paradise then already and wouldn't need to bash on good movies, you'd have a wall to bash your head on instead."
"kazimer66-1","7","5","9","25 March 2011"," Live Action Anime Film
","Sucker Punch = anime fan's wet dream! The best sentence to describe this film - ""Live Action Anime!"" All the fight choreography and the poses were ripped right out of Japanese anime. I'm not sure if Snyder or Shibuya are anime fans, but the film definitely had that vibe. Which leads me to believe that this film will do well in the overseas Asian markets where anime is far more prolific in the market.<br/><br/>Visually amazing of course, Snyder never fails to deliver the visuals, however the story was a bit disjointed at points. It is very unfortunate that the foreshadowing very early on essentially offered up the end of the film. The audience should be allowed to discover it on their own. Perhaps a lack of objectivity by one who co-authored the script? Blue Jones came across as a weak antagonist, even when he got mean I didn't find it really believable. Maybe it was because there was a problem nailing down what the antagonist was? Blue or the short time Baby Doll had to escape. Some focus on this aspect would have helped to drill the story down to it's essential parts.<br/><br/>The whole step-father aspect seemed to be some sort of MacGuffin or a loose thread left dangling, I couldn't really tell since it was abandoned early on without explanation or clear reason. This happened a few more times during the movie.<br/><br/>If each of the girls were a splinter of Baby Doll's mind, then where does Sweet Pea fit in since she is supposed to be real? If they were not, then why wasn't that made clear? We see the girls in the asylum early on, and then the story focuses exclusively on what appears to be Baby Doll's ""fantasy world""- what happened to the asylum? <br/><br/>""Inception"" this is NOT folks! <br/><br/>Many aspects were introduced in this film and then never really revisited. The asylum, the step father, the other patients, it became initially puzzling, which then turned to annoying... <br/><br/>Ambiguity as a gimmick is really sloppy story telling, IMHO. <br/><br/>To revisit the asylum and the parallel events (we suspect) is to reinforce the idea of Baby Doll's fantasy or psychosis, which would have helped the film round out the story.<br/><br/>The segway into the various ""missions"" was rather smart and the anachronistic touches were clever, however after the second one, they began to appear rather generic as they didn't appear to have any discernible theme outside of different war eras.<br/><br/>Scott Glen as the wise man throughout didn't work for me. It stretched my suspension of disbelief too far to see an American as the wise man in Japan (even if this was an American girl's fantasy). <br/><br/>The first sequence should have had a Japanese actor like Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa playing the wise man and for each segment a different appropriate wise man would appear with a common iconic catch phrase or article of clothing that would make Baby Doll recognize him. Perhaps a Frenchman for the second like Jean Reno, a Brit for the third, like Daniel Craig and finally Glenn for the last. That would lend sense of period focus to each war era mission.<br/><br/>I found the Action sequences were merely there-visually stunning to be sure, but not very thematic as far as I could tell. I hoped they would become progressively more challenging and difficult to complete, but they didn't go there. They were action vignettes for the sake of action, not so much to progress the story along in any meaningful way.<br/><br/>For the record, as a frequent movie goer I am really getting tired of the shaky hand-cam shots in recent films lately! <br/><br/>NEWS FLASH to DIRECTORS! : <br/><br/>Shaky cameras don't give the audience sense of frenetic action. It only serves to confuse the visuals and annoy the viewer. Take a cue from Stanley Kubrick's work on ""Full Metal Jacket"" and master action shots with the damn steady cam! <br/><br/>Ultimately what ""Sucker Punch"" lacks is a heart, a soul to draw people into the plight of Baby Doll. That never happened. Perhaps it was the weak antagonist or the various dangling story threads abandoned to allow more screen time for extended fantasy sequences with the ""wow"" factor.<br/><br/>The real life peril Baby Doll was in, was a dramatic story unto itself and it never seemed to be fully exploited, which was unfortunate.<br/><br/>All in all, Sucker Punch is a fairly descent anime styled film, with several shortcomings. Those who love pure eye candy action will love it, others who are more discerning or require a strong narrative may not care so much.<br/><br/>The smartest thing the studio did for this movie is to go for the PG-13 film rating. Adolescents will certainly appreciate all the flash of the ""Goth Girls with Guns"" action. A more sophisticated crowd might quickly pass on the picture.<br/><br/>I saw a lot of potential, that was never realized. Maybe Mr.Snyder should stick to making films he DIDN'T write...<br/><br/>I wish more producers would at least have enough business acumen to send a director's script to a screenwriter for the final pass.<br/><br/>Too often a film maker shooting their own words lacks the necessary objectivity to cut or change the film so that it works."

","If you have no knowledge about this movie going in you would probably expect an action packed thrill ride, based on the commercials. The commercials really sell this one short though, they make it seem like the movie will be centered around action, and that just isn't true. The movie does contain spectacular sequences of action that will satisfy anyone's hunger for action, but it has a story too. The story is the main part of the movie, not action, as the commercials may lead you to believe. It takes a true master to be able to balance action and story as elegantly as they are balanced in this movie. Zack Snyder is a master of action, we all know 300, but I honestly didn't expect such a compelling story in a movie directed by him, but I was pleasantly surprised. I recommend seeing this movie, you will be surprised too."
"NotSureifthisis7734","10","8","17","27 March 2011"," An astonishing film -- imagine ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" done in live-action anime
","I just got back from the theater and instead of letting the film settle in my mind, I thought I would just dash out some random thoughts. This is one amazing movie, a beautifully told story, emotional, grim (how did this ever get a PG-13?), wonderfully cast and acted throughout. I was mesmerized during the entire film; Sucker Punch held my attention effortlessly. <br/><br/>So why is there so much negativity regarding it? It honestly looks like most critics did not get it, did not know how to respond to it, couldn't figure it out if the first 5 minutes and gave up. Even the negative reviews, and there are a lot of them, seem to be cribbing from other, as if few knew quite what to say. So instead of just watching the movie and going with it, they chose to ignore what was on the screen, as if they could not get back to the office (Oh, why did I chose to be film critic?) and pound out their reviews. They and their colleagues need to return their diplomas from film school. And then find another line of work.<br/><br/>I honestly do not believe you can absorb this movie in one sitting. Many will no doubt think they can (""Oh, I get it, girl power. Been there, done that"") but I assure you they will be wrong. My initial guess is that the film is primarily about freedom: existential, psychological, and perhaps even political (and no, I do not mean only sexual politics). I believe the film is intended to be prophetic. It is urging us, in highly symbolic terms to be sure, to draw on all the sources of strength (including fantasy) that we possess -- just to survive. We will surely need them all in the coming years. I would like to have young people see this film, but as noted it isn't for the 16 and under set.<br/><br/>The reason being my primary source of admiration for the film: there is so much one can talk about after viewing this movie and that is a very good thing.<br/><br/>This is Snyder's masterpiece. This is his vision, wonderfully realized. It is incredibly sad that this film is being ignored by the critics and will likely be lost to much of the audience. There is talk it will even kill Snyder's career. And yet, all that is necessary to enjoy ""Sucker Punch"" is to simply go with it. Everything is logically laid out and is easy to follow. You will never get lost. One might still not get it all on first viewing, but I assure you there is plenty there to enjoy. <br/><br/>A personal note: I don't recall ever going to see a movie whose ratings were at 20% (as given in the well-known movie review site). I decided to take a risk after reading some fan-boy reviews and watching the previews. I am glad I did. I had liked Snyder's other films and this one was so damn intriguing, I could not resist. <br/><br/>The late, great film critic Gene Siskel stated that whenever two (or more) critics go to a movie and there is strong disagreement between them, the movie must have something. Trust me, ""Sucker Punch"" has a lot, and it's all great."

You get to take on Supermanbut, first, you direct an ""everything but the kitchen sink"" fantasy opus. That's what ""Sucker Punch"" is, the fifth film by Zack Snyder, and both are unabashedly madcap.<br/><br/>Set in 1960s Vermont, reality is hell for pre-teen Babydoll (doe-eyed Emily Browning of ""A Series of Unfortunate Events""). After her mom dies, her stepdad nearly molesting her and her kid sister accidentally killed during a defense, she's committed to an all-girl's asylum, co-managed by dutiful shrink Dr. Gorski, (heavy-Polish voiced Carla Gugino of ""Elektra Luxx"" and ""Sin City"") and morally dubious security chief Blue (Oscar Issac of Ridley Scott's ""Robin Hood"").<br/><br/>The place's no picnic, but Babydoll retreats to her off-beat imagination, where the asylum's a burlesque hall/bordello; Blue and Gorski run the joint and she and the four inmates she's close to-siblings Sweetpea (mature Abbie Cornish of ""Bright Star"" and ""Legend of the Guardians"") and Rocket (Joan Cusack-like Jena Malone of ""Donnie Darko""); Amber (Jamie Chung of ""Sorority Row"") and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens of the High School Musicals films) are ""the talent"".<br/><br/>The four are also Babydoll's comrades in her fantasies as she dances off-screen; the quintet are gun-toting, sword-wielding bad ass girls, assigned by the mysterious sage Wiseman (Scott Glenn of ""Training Day"", ""The Right Stuff"" and a good bud of Mr. Snyder's) to retrieve five items that can liberate them. Giant stone samurais, German army zombies, ogre knights, robots, a fire-breathing dragon and Blue are in the way. Girl Power Go! <br/><br/>""Punch"", at 120 minutes, can be easily dismissed as a fringe pop culture heap, but only if you've never grew up with comic books, Heavy Metal magazine, anime and video games (Go join a bingo club, you old farts!!!). Snyder (""Guardians"", ""Watchmen"",""300"", the Dawn of the Dead remake) and co-scribe/school chum Steve Shibuya (a vet production hand who worked on the cult film, ""Killer Klowns From Outer Space"") have, and they're not ashamed. Why should they, having typed a passion project that's trippy and layered? There are also the elements of hypocrisy, individualism, sexual objectification, pedophilia (borderlined to get a PG-13 rating) and fetishism. At the helm, Snyder's a kid in a candy store with his trademark slow-motion action and intricate shots (courtesy of d.p. Larry Fong). Imagine Sam Peckinpah as a fanboy, and you got Zack Snyder.<br/><br/>Human dramatics are simple but powerful here, thanks to the cast; ladies Browning, Cornish and Malone stand out from the five. Mr. Issac's creepy misogynistic as a security capo (reality) and a mustachioed, Dean Martin-like pimp. Ms. Gugino (also of ""Watchmen"") is durable as a mother hen to the girls. The appearance of Jon Hamm (""Mad Men"", ""The Town"") as a lobotomist is strange but story vital. Mr. Glenn nicely echoes the late David Carradine while sharing the same costume sense as Sam Jackson in ""The Spirit"". Look out for Zack's cub, Eli, and win a prize! Most of Zack's production posse's here, including wardrobe guru Mike Wilkinson and music man Tyler Bates (helped by Marcus DeVries).<br/><br/>Even if they don't see the plot's twist, gamers and riot girls will swoon after ""Sucker Punch"" hits them.

"ferguson-6","4","11","26","29 March 2011"," Oh, and one more thing ...
","Greetings again from the darkness. I am actually a fan of Zack Snyder's two most recent films: 300 and Watchmen. Because of those films, I was really looking forward to what he would do with his first original piece. Two things are now very clear. First, Mr. Snyder is a visual virtuoso with film. Secondly, he is not much of a writer.<br/><br/>I'll start with the bad news. I was stunned at how lousy the story and script were. Some of the dialogue is so bad it comes across as purposefully dumbed down. If that is the intention, then I must ask WHY? It's clearly not a movie for little kids, so most over aged 13 are quite capable of following a story. Therein lies the biggest problem. This isn't even a story! The ending makes absolutely no sense and the road to that ending just makes you happy it's over ... no matter the dumb ending.<br/><br/>The good news is that Mr. Snyder's visual effects do not disappoint. There are some terrific battle scenes and one of the coolest on screen dragons you'll ever see. The film is very dark and muted in colors (think Sin City) but that works for the dream sequences and the asylum interiors. Very little color is present other than just before the dance sequences. Speaking of, what's with the dance sequences? If Baby Doll's dancing is the key to the film, shouldn't we get more than just a head-bob? The premise is that Baby Doll (Emily Browning) is cast away to an asylum by her step-father. She has five days to escape or she faces a lobotomy. Yes, really. She quickly discovers that her dancing has a mesmerizing effect on all those watching and she can escape into her fantasy world. While there, she meets a Wise Man played by Scott Glenn in a role that would have been perfect for the late David Carradine. The Wise Man tells her what to do to gain her freedom and she quickly enlists the help of some other inmates: Sweat Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens)and Amber (Jamie Chung).<br/><br/>The asylum has an even darker side as run by Blue (Oscar Isaac). He forces Dr Vera Gorski (Carla Gugin) to teach the girls to dance so as to entertain ""high rollers"" who pay big bucks to Blue to spend time with the girls. Gugino plays her character like a rip-off of Natasha Fatale from the old Bullwinkle cartoons. Blue is just a weaselly bad guy who brings nothing to the film ... and this film needed a top notch bad guy.<br/><br/>The actresses all seem like they got into their roles and enjoy the physicality required for the fighting and action scenes. Cornish especially comes off well. Browning in the lead as Baby Doll brings no real baggage to the role as most won't recognize her. Jena Malone has been an indie film favorite for years and Ms. Hudgens is trying to find a new audience after the High School musical films.<br/><br/>This movie was pitched as ""Alice in Wonderland with machine guns"". I believe that is a slap to the face of Lewis Carroll. Watching this movie is like watching someone else play a video game that you aren't familiar with ... or a two hour music video of a terrible song. So if you must see it, enjoy the visual effects and don't think too much about what the characters say or why they do what they do. And let's all hope that Mr. Snyder's visuals payoff for next year's Superman movie ... and be glad that Christopher Nolan is working on that script!"

","I watched this recently not expecting much, another sausage factory Hollywood action/superhero movie. I was very pleasantly surprised. This is going on my top 20 film list.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Contains some minor spoilers but no major plot lines are revealed<br/><br/>Sucker Punch delivers a deep and moving story wrapped up in wonderful CGI and fantasy content. You follow the tragic story of Baby Doll, abused by her stepfather who having murdered her younger sister commits Baby Doll to a mental asylum and arranges for her to be lobotomized. All this to get his hands on her mothers inheritance. Baby Doll in order to escape the horror of her reality descends into layers of fantasy. The fantasy's disguise the reality you do not see but subtle clues give insight to the horror of her situation. She endeavors to free herself from her situation and hatches a plan to escape... <br/><br/>The film is visually stunning and mentally challenging. On the surface you could see the way the girls are represented as exploitative and sexist but you would be missing the point. Each layer of the film changes the balance of power from men to women, men control the women in the real world through violence and intimidation, but the women can control the men using ""their weapons"", sexuality, strength of spirit and sorority. The men are powerless in the face of this and in the deepest layers are destroyed. The major theme is about control and consent, men can impose their fantasy on women but women can take ownership of the fantasy and use it to their own ends.<br/><br/>The closest I can come to a comparison to this film is Pan's Labyrinth (with kick ass fight scenes thrown in). <br/><br/>One last thing, the title, for me the sucker punch is a subtle joke, this refers to the feeling you get as a viewer, the film turns on you and delivers a killer blow."
"Dory_Darko","3","6","12","19 November 2013"," You can't spell ""Sucker Punch"" without ""suck""
","Wow Here I was, thinking I was going to get to see an awesome comic- like film about a group of girls kickin' a whole lotta butt surrounded by mind-bending fantasy scenery.<br/><br/>Technically, I was right But only technically. Sucker Punch is like Chinese food. You can eat three plates and it will still leave you feeling hungry. It's a great deal of empty calories, is basically what I'm saying. Substance? Nah.<br/><br/>Let me just get right into it. What's wrong with Sucker Punch is the screenplay. Not the actors, not the director, just the story. This story revolves around a group of five girls in an institution for the mentally insane, in a fantastical, steampunk-wannabe 1940's (my best guess) setting. They are treated horribly and their lives are miserable, and to cope with it all, the main protagonist Babydoll, escapes into her fantasies and in this trance-like state, devises a plan for them all to escape. <br/><br/>The concept is not bad. It might have even been really exciting, had it not been executed so laughably unrealistic. And by 'unrealistic', I don't mean the fantasies themselves. I'm referring to the fact that these fantasies were so obviously not dreamed up by an actual teenage girl, but rather they look like the perfect fulfillment of the wet wishes of a horny teenage boy. It is very likely that a teenage girl WOULD dream of being able to wield a samurai sword and beat up every monster, dragon and every other kind of bastard who crosses her path. She WOULD dream of coming out of every battle completely unscathed and with every hair on her pretty head still perfectly in place. She would NOT, however, be doing all of this scantily clad in sexy lingerie wearing fishnet stockings and high heels I am a girl, with very vivid imagination. Trust me on this one. It was, in one word, ridiculous.<br/><br/>Another thing that really bothered me was the way these characters were worked out. As obviously miserable as their personal predicaments were, I could not relate to a single one of them. They were all completely 2- dimensional and just flat-out uninteresting. I didn't care about what happened to a single one of them. I don't believe all of the blame for this falls on the actresses (although theirs weren't exactly Oscar winning performances...), again, I chalk it up to poor screen writing. The only one who was able to make her character slightly more than moderately interesting, was not even one of 'the girls', it was Dr. Vera Gorski, played by Carla Gugino. At least she was interesting to watch, and she was even somewhat of a scene-stealer, taking much thunder away from the girls simply because she (both the actress and the character) had the biggest personality. All the others, I felt were mostly just going through the motions, because they had zero character development and no interesting dialogue to work with. And that's bad when you're talking about the characters that are supposed to carry the story. A pleasant (and much needed surprise) came in the form of Scott Glenn, who only appears in the fantasy segments as several different versions of a wise man. That was a nice touch. <br/><br/>However, the one thing that really stood out for me as the true axis of failure that sums up Sucker Punch, was the feeling of total confusion that was present from the beginning and never cleared up. I'm not saying I didn't 'get it', I'm saying it was a hot, incoherent mess. And I usually don't mind being thrown back and forth and to and fro throughout a film, I don't mind playing guessing games and wondering what it will all lead to. I DO mind when the roller-coaster ride is over and all I feel is queasy. Some people have suggested that this is a really deep and complex film, but honestly, I think they're just reading too much into it. The stupid thing is, for the most part it was completely predictable, and STILL it lacked structure and decent storytelling. That may seem like a paradox, but there's an easy way to explain it. In the words of the great Roger Ebert: ""Now that's bad filmmaking."" <br/><br/>The only element in Sucker Punch that was somewhat redeeming, were the visual effects. I must say, it was all very gorgeous and eye-pleasing. Also, the soundtrack was excellent, filled with very well performed covers of well-known songs and some perfectly chosen originals. Emily Browning, who plays Babydoll (and also sings a few songs on the soundtrack), was a good choice for the lead role, but I must say, in all honesty, that was mostly because she was visually very appealing as the main protagonist. More simply put – she was very pretty. Still, I'm not sure that's enough to carry a film. <br/><br/>All in all, I'm left feeling – Zack Snyder Dude. What were you thinking. You can do so much better than this. I guess I just finally have to come to terms with the fact that everybody's human and is bound to make one big mistake at least once in their lives. Zack this is yours.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch sucks."

","An absolute incompetent mess. I was so excited for this, and it just let me down. Snyder should never again try and fart and original idea from his brain. How could you mess up sexy girls, dragons, robots, and samurai warriors with chain-guns. This film looked exciting and fun, and I wasn't expecting anything more than that. The film opens with a music video montage, of what should be the emotionally defining moment. Instead we get a terrible cover of ""Sweet Dreams"", a song choice with all the subtlety of a fat man at the gym. We see the evil stepfather, who is so evil, he straightens his tie after his wife dies and gives a seedy smile. He may as well just say ""YES! Now my wife is dead I can rape my stepdaughters."" He does the tie thing not once, but twice. After Snyder skips over what should be important character development, we are thrust into a computer game dream sequence where the ""plot"" is unveiled. Basically, Babydoll needs 5 items to escape. Each item can be found in a different fantasy/level. These action scenes are so sudden that they have no tension. I don't care about these girls because you haven't introduced us. The action scenes look dumb and fun, but are played out in all seriousness. Snyder tries to mix fun action with a story about mentally and sexually abused girls.This is all done in complete earnest. Like an exploitation film that wants to be taken seriously. As I watched the movie I was simply critiquing it. I even managed to enjoy X-Men The Last Stand and Spider-Man 3 whilst I was watching them. This movie just flat out abused me without the common courtesy of having anything going for it. Sucker Punch cold have been so much more, but the lack of fluidity between scenes, and the feeling that Snyder thinks this might be important, was all a bit too much."
"doctorsmoothlove","1","6","12","11 May 2011"," At least the title works.
","Sucker Punch confirms many of the numerous allegations levied against Zack Snyder for his adult films. Now people have evidence of misogyny and pointlessness that was only suggested earlier. His latest film reveals, beyond these simple criticisms, a surprising inability to construct a whole film out of his ideas. His insistence in bludgeoning us with repetitive (and frankly boring) action sequences only amplifies the lack of meaning behind his projects.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch borrows its narrative structure from platforming videogames (meaning players guide an avatar through distinct levels). This isn't necessarily a problem, just look at Scott Pilgrim vs. The World but Snyder was too lazy to translate one medium into another. In his flick, the main character enters a prison facility (the overworld), meets her allies (other playable characters), learns she must find certain items to escape (mission objectives), fights fearsome enemies (these vary between boss fights and regular encounters), and tries to escape the prison (beating the game.<br/><br/>Going along with the video game structure is an appropriate level of fetishization of his five female characters. Each gets a sexy name like ""Baby Doll"" and wears skimpy clothing completely inappropriate for her environment (who fights Nazi zombies in a tank top?). Snyder is emulating the hyper-masculine sensibility of ""hardcore"" games usually played by young males. His problem is not including a story to go along with his setup. Even derivative games have some loose plot that serves only to introduce each level logically. All we see here are different game fantasies thrown at us senselessly. Even by game standards where the plot can be de-emphasized, this is unacceptable.<br/><br/>Instead, after his characters finish a random mission, they return to be humiliated, beaten, sexually assaulted, or killed. So much for proto-feminism. His disregard of women for any purpose other than the sexual satisfaction of men is clearer with each passing intermission between levels. It's almost like a therapeutic effort on his part to show the positives of a group he obviously feels is inferior, all while stroking his enlarged hubris."

I've never actually reviewed movies on here; but this movie compelled me to express my disappointment.<br/><br/>Within the very first 10 minutes, I felt absolutely no connection with the story line & lost interest in any of the characters. The scenes were random & made little connection to any any part of the so-called reality from imagination of the main character ""baby doll"". At the end of the movie- adding insult to injury- the whole moral of the movie was once again reiterated to the audience; as if it was so intricate of a plot and thus needing explanation.

","Brilliant realization of the human story of oppression overlayed with (or, with layers underneath, if you prefer) of highly meaningful questions that cut to the core of our individual and collective western experience of life itself: the trappings, the mechanisms, and themes of innocence versus not so much, male and female roles in society, dominance versus submission, imprisonment versus freedom, the seen versus the unseen, reality versus the life of the mind, intolerance & mysogeny versus tolerance & celebrating female power, and so much more. Let go, and let it take you away, as it will be long in your thoughts, possibly even life changing.

"socialsammy","9","4","7","16 May 2017"," So Deep and Amazing Graphics!
","I watched Sucker Punch recently and absolutely fell in love with the concept. Baby Doll suffered dissociative identity disorder and would send her mind to another reality to escape the hell she was living in. There is also controversy that Sweet Pea is an alter of Baby Doll, and in the end as Sweet Pea leaves to safety (her mind has left the world) Baby Doll still in the present, being lobotomized, and trapped (she was the human sacrifice). Just goes to show you that deep-thinking movies like these never have a definite answer, leaving the watcher to think for themselves. That was all Sucker Punch. <br/><br/>The graphics are so intricate and I love how in Baby Doll's dreams, there is never any blood. It's either smoke, light, etc. which I thought was very creative on Snyder's part.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have is it's too condensed. There is such a deep meaning that the movie could go on and on and explain the concept further. But because it's condensed in under 2 hours, you really need to pay attention or you'll miss the slightest of detail."
"embless","10","4","7","25 September 2016"," This Film Rocks With Deep Psychology Wrapped Within It
","I've watched this film at least half a dozen times, I'd really love to watch the extended version to get more of the story. It took me several viewings to realize that Not many people would actually understand what this film is addressing and bringing to light. All wrapped within a visually graphic telling. Sure the characters and the initial plot captured my attention, but than as I watched it for a second and third time a few years after it's first release, I began to realize that this story is clearly outlining a very psychological depiction of one of the characters.... And no it's not the first female character to which we are introduced to upon the opening of the film. It is going through a very personal therapeutic process to which any ""average joe"" off the street is simply Not going to see when watching this film, due to it's sexy elements and darker theatrics. True it is a story within a story within a story, but only a few viewers will actually understand that this film is depicting an intimate therapy session with someone who is MPD. Once I understood that, I re-watched the film and it again opened up a whole other learning and perspective for me, I no longer saw this film at such a flashy ""dolled up, awesome CG"" gamer/nerd movie; like so many others do. I was seeing this film beyond what was merely entertainment value, and analyzing it from a much deeper perspective. And it has taken me watching it several more times to realize that this story is in fact very complex, and it is done in such a modernized way that it is masked beautifully to those who can not see it for more than it's superficial/plot twisted/darker story-line. Sucker Punch is an elaborately woven modern perspective that tells us, it's viewers, what it is like for someone with MPD who has been willing to go through an intense therapy session or sessions to begin the process of becoming an Individual, instead of allowing her multiple personalities rule her mind. It gives average people a small glimpse into the reality that MPD does exist and what it does to someone, that that someone has more than one single individual within their psyche due to absolutely horrific trauma. By the end of this film, it concludes that the person has finally joined all of her multiple personalities and has been successful and eliminating those persons within herself; ergo finally being able to be out in the real world and be free to lead a normal life as an Individual. True this story is darker and a great watch, but let me just say in my opinion, that once the deeper story-line comes to light for those watching it and they become more aware of what it is being said underneath the story within a story within a story, it makes watching Sucker Punch such an eye opening new story all together. MPD is something only a few have personal experience with, it is real, and not many can say for certain that they fully understand what it is and how it effects the people surrounding them. Sucker Punch is a very graphically charged, wildly wrapped up, modern Multiple Personality Disorder movie for us modern folks. If only it actually looked visually that way, not many will get what the film really is about. It's done very well and I enjoy watching and learning something new each time I view it for myself."
"Floated2","8","4","7","17 July 2013"," If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything.
","Sucker Punch is a film by director Zack Synder (300, Watchmen) which glorifies violence with great visuals and has wonderful cinematography. Sucker Punch is an action movie and the action scenes are brilliantly made. A lot of criticism seems to stream that the film was not rated R (probably would have been better- making it more realistic) and that the story is thin. However, this did not bother me as I had no expectations and did not watch this for a complex story. I was interested and entertained throughout the film and I feel that Synder did his job well.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch isn't that completely brainless and pointless, there is a story within it and one would get confused it they are not paying attention. The acting was solid, Emily Browning steals the film as the lead as Babydoll. Abie Cornish does well as Sweatpea, the leader of the group who isn't convinced of Babydoll's ways. The rest of the girls Rocket, Blondie and Amber are solid supporting cast, however more could have been explained more for their characters. Carly Gugino and Oscar Isaac also do a great job portraying their characters. Overall Sucker Punch is a fun ride and not nearly as bad as some of the critics have been pointing out."
"Ultimex_Varptuner","8","4","7","10 August 2012"," Beautiful, magical, inspiring.
","Despite it's critical mauling and audience apathy, the world created by Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch is something truly special, uniquely beautiful and, though flawed, it stands as a good example of the ongoing trend of big name directors gambling on films that offer something different to the same old story, same old set pieces and same old sequel friendly endings.<br/><br/>I'm biased. I admit, this film could easily have been made just for me: I am a white male in my 30's who loves video games, fantastical fiction and beautiful women kicking ass in skimpy costumes.<br/><br/>That said, I like artistic depth and bold choices in my cinema and despite Sucker Punch's lurid façade and apparent lack of characterisation, it is a film of considerable profundity which belies a high level of attention to detail and artistry.<br/><br/>Dealing as it does with a brooding 1950's nightmare of loss and domestic dysfunction, giving way to a young woman's incarceration in a mental asylum; in turn snapping to a fevered vision of a glamorous yet resolutely abusive brothel which holds young, vulnerable women hostage in order to 'entertain' various n'er do wells. From there we are dragged deeper into a series of microcosmic worlds populated by monsters, robots and steam-powered zombies, in which our protagonists re-materialise as an elite team of ludicrously sexy and infinitely cool warrior women. I think it's fair to say that I can't think of another film that does visually beautiful, surreal, action-packed and amazingly choreographed to such a mad degree. But yet, never does it feel gratuitous, pondering, as it does, matters of guilt, regret, atonement and self sacrifice throughout.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the films lack of character development and reliance on music video style to tell it's story and, to be honest this is true. However, rather than a weakness, this is simply how Snyder has chosen to tell the tale. On first viewing, it is perhaps less than effective. The story is not thrilling. It is something different: like a visual poem, it whispers to you, drawing you into the luxurious veils of chocolate brown, copper blue and red wine that seduce the eye. I must confess that initially, it was only the outward glamour that held my attention and only upon reaching the end, contemplating the sparse dialogue and the portent glowing symbols which spring from the screen, did I think about it all and realise just what an unusual and magical film it was. The next day I watched it again. The day after, I watched the extended edition. Now, despite it's flaws it is one of my favourite films.<br/><br/>Regarding said extended edition. Yes, it is required viewing if the original version cast as much of a spell over you as it did me, but as a standalone work, it is inferior to the theatrical version.<br/><br/>A couple of the scenes blatantly should have made the final cut: Baby Doll's conversation with the High Roller at the end is absolutely beautiful to watch and listen to, gives huge credit to both actors and backs up the Doctor's apparent compassion towards the asylum inmates. Equally, there are a few bits and bobs in the phenomenal 'trenches' sequence that should have stayed.<br/><br/>On the other hand a couple of bits, ultimately should have remained on the cutting room floor. We didn't need to see Sweet Pea stealing the clothes from the washing line at the end. It only served to undermine the dignity and beauty of this wonderful character, so tenderly played by Abbie Cornish. Equally, the stylised gunplay in the 'dragon' sequence was a bit of a bridge to far. While elsewhere, the weapon handling is quite convincing and does credit to the film's military advisors; here things get slightly ridiculous. Also Sweet Pea's swordplay in this scene looks a little weaker than Baby Doll's.<br/><br/>Lastly, things I am on the fence about: The extra musical number in the brothel. Yes, it's great to watch if you are already familiar with the film. But perhaps it lightened the mood just a shade too much, showing a playful side to Blue and giving too much of an identity to the other girls in the brothel, who, for the remainder of the film, remain as indistinct beauties in the background.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder apparently commented somewhere that the film was not completely finished. Indeed you can imagine the big money behind the project getting jittery about how abstract it was, tapping their watches and ripping the incomplete product from his hands. Indeed, this lack of completeness does resonate somewhat in the film. The ending in particular is fairly cerebral and downbeat. It is possible that on first viewing you might not even pick up that Sweet Pea is the narrator and that both Baby Doll and the Wise Man are 'Angels'.<br/><br/>It is a flawed piece, no doubt. But as mainstream Hollywood films go, it is among the most interesting, thought provoking and downright stunning films of it's generation.<br/><br/>You have the weapons now use them!"

","I avoided this film like the plague when it was in theaters, having heard nothing but the worst reviews imaginable. Hardly anyone had anything nice to say about it, and usually that is a pretty good indicator a film is bad. I mean, one or two bad reviews can usually be brushed off. Even a 50/50 split amongst critics can sometimes indicate a good, but misunderstood film. But when a movie is universally panned, it's a safe bet that you're not missing anything by skipping it. <br/><br/>Wow, were they wrong here. I decided to catch Sucker Punch on HBO now that it's available, and I'm very glad I did. It's definitely not a perfect movie, but it's also nowhere near as bad as we've all been led to believe. <br/><br/>It's got a few moments that don't really work, and I could have done entirely without the narration at the end, but other than that, it's a terrific, beautifully stylized action fantasy, filled with imaginative villains, lush graphics, pretty girls and a uniquely offbeat storyline. <br/><br/>I simply don't understand where all the hate came from here. Yeah, it generally portrays a male adolescent fantasy of hot girls in skimpy outfits. Big freaking deal. There are far more exploitative films out there, few of which inspired the level of vitriol hurled at Sucker Punch. It's a cool fantasy film, with heavy elements of B-movie and classic pulp noir skillfully added for good measure. <br/><br/>How this film can be hated but something like Grindhouse critically beloved is beyond my comprehension. Yes, Grindhouse is better. But not so much better to justify the massive disparity (83% to 23% on Rotten Tomatoes).<br/><br/>And I'm not even a big Zach Snyder fan to begin with. I thought Watchmen was awful, and didn't think very much of 300 either. But I have to give him credit on this one; he was truly robbed this time around."

","A lot of films aren't nice to strong women. The are independent to a point, and in the end, need a man to save them. The film makers are either misogynistic (""Oh yeah, you're tough, but in the end you still need a man""), or maybe they feel a lot of viewers don't want to see women do it for themselves. The women in Snyder's movies are different, they don't need men to come to the rescue in the end, but take out the guys themselves. Take Lena Headey's Gorgo who stabbed the a-hole councilor in the gut, rather than need a guy come to save her.<br/><br/>The women of Sucker Punch are the same, they fight, no men by their side, and do it on their own. They are my ideal movie women, hot and tough. No damsel in distress garbage. There's no make out session with a boy friend, there's are some nice ass kickings, good special effects, dance practice routines,and the guys who imprison and exploit them get their comeuppances. The pay back comes at a huge cost however.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is a ripper :-), and I'm never bored of playing it.<br/><br/>Plus, there are two Aussies in the lead. Yeah :-) Emily Browning, and Abbie Cornish. Brwowning is the new comer, the strategist, and organiser of the break out, while Browning is the reluctant, skeptical, but willing rebel who joins in the plot.<br/><br/>Plus the story is easy to follow.Some flicks with mind warping stories are good, but they're not the only type of entertainment. Not everything has to be Shakepeare or Dostoevsky.<br/><br/>I know this movie has received a lot of flack; mixed reviews, a small profit, and worst movie of 2011 in a recent poll. A few people I've spoken to don't like it either. But I don't care. I'll like this movie even if I'm the only person who does, and even if I lose an argument in public and I am ripped to shreds.<br/><br/>The only down side was that John Hamm didn't get his butt kicked. I would be nice justice on Don Draper.<br/><br/>That said, this goes with The Craft, and Ghost World as my equal favourite movie of all time. Gorgeous iron women, no damsel in distress trash, Aussies in the lead, special effects, easy to understand, and an epic soundtrack. 10/10"

","Although our fantasies (=electronic impulse action) are an effect of our real life situation it doesn't actually matter what our real life situation is, whether we are inmates in an insane asylum or go-go dancing whores in a bordello, the resulting electronic impulse action may as well be the same and ultimately it's those fantasies that matter because they are over-the-top cool in slow motion with Rolling Stone magazine's Top 500 songs as a soundtrack except it's better because they can sound however we want them to sound - - - Like, you love the song Sweet Dreams but aren't a fan of Annie Lennox' voice? No problem, just imagine your own voice singing it but at the same time imagine you being at a place called ""Lennox"" house just to give that woman some credit for the fun that you are having.<br/><br/>So while the nature of the electronic impulse action indeed is an effect of our real life situation it really is a symbiosis as it is the electronic impulse action that is the motor (=motivation) to our behavior while reality is the fuel. What's nice is that fantasy can make us believe that electronic impulse action isn't just an effect but that it actually does effect, in other words, through some paradox cause-and-effect logic it can create a muddled plot construction that turns reality around to become the fantasy and vice versa. But this is just stating the obvious.<br/><br/>There isn't much to human existence, all the Schopenhauer, Freud and Goethe can be found in what is generally perceived as shallow pop culture. This digested matter that has been summed up to its essential elements and has been beautified to be easily consumable holds the history of centuries and the wisdom of generations and it's in fact all around us as if it was the very element that the invisible but omnipresent æther was made of. And that's why Snyder can make a film that is an accumulation of platitudes and ideas that all already are a part of pop culture and still end up with a film that is kind of thoughtful and has a point because the ideas are just canalized enough towards one general goal...even though the script often seems like it was made up as they went along.<br/><br/>'Sucker Punch' comes with all the typical Snyder short-comings some of which are even amplified here although they don't really matter all that much in the grand scheme of things and can basically be shrugged off with ""yeah, but the movie isn't ABOUT that"" but it's somewhat understandable that so many people are bothered by them in his multi-million dollar movies when most of the same people probably wouldn't even batter an eye lid if the same shortcomings came up in a low budget film...but this is just something I wanted to have mentioned on the side, it's not like I condemn having different standards for different types of movies.<br/><br/>So for example proper empathizing of scenes and moments is in the crapper, every scene is a comic panel of the same size, they are all equally important which in this Snyder film is especially destructive since the plot (the little there is of it) deals with different realities but in the end they are basically all thrown into the same pot, on the other hand it's actually a plus since I think thematically the film makes an argument for the different realities all BEING equally important. Personally I wasn't too hot about the editing and I could have done with a lot less of the poorly motivated video game action nonsense (I dug the Matrix-esque one with the robots on the train, though, this scene was cranked up to eleven stylistically) but that's just me getting old, the kids love it.<br/><br/>'Sucker Punch' is not about the fight for physical freedom as some may believe (Baby Doll WANTED to be lobotomized and the last scenes of the ""escaped"" girl are also part of a fantasy) but about freedom within ones mind, a freedom that also ends there and doesn't extend to a desire for freedom in physical reality as, for example, in 'The Matrix'. In the end 'Sucker Punch' is a glorification of escapism and in the form of escapism it makes a solid argument FOR this comfortable ""lifestyle choice"".<br/><br/>8/10"
"technical0","Null","4","7","18 August 2011"," A Misunderstood Movie
","There are a lot of bad reviews for this film, but it seems that these reviewers have generally completely missed the point, mostly referring to it as a pointless, titillating, wet dream. Yet in actuality the movie is an interesting take on a particularly deep philosophical message.<br/><br/>Firstly, it does amuse me how much sexy girls get slated by reviewers. Of course this is simply jealousy. Either the reviewer is a thoroughly unsexy female, jealous of what she wishes she could be, or a man who believes he has no chance with such beautiful girls and prefers to simply dismiss them as worthless. Me, I am a mid-thirties male (which probably puts me in the so-called ""demographic"") and I like women. A lot. I especially like sexy women. If they are wearing next to nothing, even better. And if that next to nothing is latex, better still. Add some weapons and martial arts and that suits me down to the ground. But then again I don't feel threatened by them, and I guess that's the difference.<br/><br/>In terms of special effects you get exactly what you would expect from Snyder, and you won't be disappointed, but what I particularly liked was the quite original take on what constituted the bad guys and how the action scenes resembled a computer game. Certainly an original concept with some very nicely executed sequences. Some of the acting could have been a bit better I suppose and the dialog was fairly basic. It's never going to be a classic, but it's a fast-paced and thoroughly enjoyable watch.<br/><br/>But now back to the guts of the film. If you thought this was simply an action film then you completely missed the point. As revealed at the end, the message of this film is that life is what we make it. That all of our fears, insecurities, happiness, love, feelings and so on are simply what we perceive them to be and that we can change all of this if we want to, it's simply up to us. This is Baby Doll's reality; life as she has made it. The depth of this message cannot be underestimated. In fact it is the essence of life. Snyder summarises it with a particularly nice quote: You have all the weapons you need, now fight.<br/><br/>If you don't understand this movie, then you have a lot to learn."

","I just rented this one with some average expectations. Saw the trailer and was quite curious, since 300 is one of my all time favorites.<br/><br/>For those CGI lovers, I guess the movie is awesome. From anime styled camera angles, to outstanding acrobatics, it really gives you the taste of state of the art sci-fi action.<br/><br/>Without spoiling the plot, the movie sets the character, into several scenarios where she must obtain an item to escape her ""prisons"" in the real world. Typical video game cliché. She even has fantastic boss fight at each ""level's"" end. This actually works quite well because the subplots within the movie are simple and engaging enough to give purpose to all these sets. If you're a fan o games like Devil May Cry, Killzone, Soul Calibur or Ninja Gaiden you'll love this movie.<br/><br/>I did find some flaws in it though. The dreamy worlds do not quite add up to ""reality"". Some ""glue"" plot is missing and after Inception you would hope for better."
"Filippos01","8","4","7","25 June 2011"," Snyder's Mulholand Drive about traumas and fighting them. Analysis.
","This isn't Mulholand Drive (the masterpiece), but I think it follows the same principals. As in Mulholand what you see on screen it's not the reality, it's just subconscious fantasy.<br/><br/>The action in the whore house and the action part is a subconscious alternate reality. The disgusting reality is in the asylum.<br/><br/>The impressive dance is certainly not a sexy dance that none can resist. All dances are in reality the patients re-acting of their traumatic experiences. Baby dolls' dance is amazing to all because her story is simply amazing, as we've seen in the superb first 7 minutes (I must have already watched the emotional galore of ""sweet dreams"" like 10 times).<br/><br/>The cgi/action scenes is actually Baby Doll fighting her demons, sometimes the step father appears with the veeery long spear, with a little help from her new made friends (now she has help, she's not scared, she will fight and win). Sometimes I could make sense of a few details, most of them I didn't get them...(anyone did please let me know??) <br/><br/>In reality their plan inside the asylum of getting the map etc is very naive. They stole the map from the office, and didn't photocopy it, so obviously the ""dr"" got the plot since there was no map behind his desk, same thing with the missing lighter--how can he not notice it missing.<br/><br/>By the way i think that the psycho doctor's speeches were accurate in both levels. What he says works for both worlds and is actually baby dolls ""plot points"" for both worlds.<br/><br/>The map, the key, the knife and the lighter are just her last memories before the lobotomy. Her subconscious took them, put them together and there you have your story.<br/><br/>To conclude, this kind of movie for a commercial creator is a big surprise. No wonder that his action packed fan base was frustrated and disappointed. They should have been warned that this is another universe from his previous films. Here, the action scenes are metaphoric and they don't drive the plot!<br/><br/>Personally, I loved many parts of the film, especially the haunting sweet dreams and the white rabbit. Especially the first one is one of my most haunting film scenes ever. It almost convinced me to fight my demons as baby doll did!<br/><br/>I won't give a 10, only because Snyder didn't succeed on helping us understand her subconscious--her real fight. There could have been many ways of hinting us more things here and there or at least at the last part of the movie spend it in the asylum...Many ways for helping the audience getting it and be in awe. <br/><br/>Its visuals and the directing/editing emotional value reach a superb level, it only needed a little more to become a masterpiece. Honestly."

","I have seen many reviews here which say that this movie is a mindless joyride of CG action and scanty clad gals with no material in it.<br/><br/>But beneath all the action and mindless killings, have you actually seen the story? Yes, I do agree that the screenplay can be summed up in a one-liner, but the way it has been presented with a fusion of real and imaginary worlds, culminating to a very well summed up ending, makes it worthwhile to have a second look, whilst trying to explore what it all had to offer. Special mention of equally applaud-worthy soundtrack (""'Where is my mind"" in particular, because of its use at right places in the movie).<br/><br/>You may say it's another adaptation of the ""Invincible"" kind of story narration genre, but the similarities end just at the level of imagination. Many say the chicks presented looked whorish, but hey, that was the need of the story (the asylum being depicted as a brothel in another world as seen by Baby Doll), the same goes with the action scenes. And just for the hell of it all, it looked awesome with the stunning action visuals nevertheless.<br/><br/>Snyder's movies are never appreciated in the first screening. It takes time to look at the story behind the action which he emphasize more on. But given his style of film-making, you can say that he's a Quentin Tarantino of his own kind. His style may not appeal to the masses, but it sure is different in its own way.<br/><br/>My advice to those who have rated this movie as just another mindless passable action flick ? Go watch it again, only this time, don't think about the action, go beyond it to explore what it says ""You have all the weapons you need....Now fight ! "" ."
"Ahriman_d","10","4","7","12 April 2011"," Sucker Punch Film Analysis
","While it may be true that this film is a CGI extravaganza it is not true that the film functions on only one level, a visual feast it may be, but this is a work with more depth than you would initially think. Am I as a red blooded heterosexual male biased by the acres of female flesh and overtly sexual nature of the films premise, yes of course I am and the film makes no apology for being aimed squarely at a young male sci-fi oriented demographic. Those who have written this film off as just misogynistic titillation though, have poorly understood the complex interplay of concepts and propositions put forward in this film. The main proposition being that reality itself is all about perception, and if it feels as real to you as the real world does, then maybe given the right circumstances it's alright to choose the fantasy instead, and nowhere in the film is this proposition more salient than in the final scenes of the main character, Baby Doll (played by Emily Browning.) Of course ignoring what is going on around you completely is not beneficial to anyone but if the fantasy helps you deal with reality, in much the same way that a nervous stage actor might picture the audience naked, then you are using something you can deal with, to help you with something you cannot. Many after viewing the closing moments of the film will be disappointed by the finish, but they would do well to take note of some lyrics by Aerosmith ""Life's a journey not a destination"" and so it is with this film, when you run away from monsters you escape them, but you take your fear with you, if you do not know how to fight back then you need to learn, and just like the philosophers of old, when you cause change without, you cause change within. It's not getting to the end that counts, its how you travelled.<br/><br/>The accompanying soundtrack to this film serves a dual purpose, it does what a good soundtrack always does and underscores the emotional highs and lows of the main characters, but it also serves as a guide that in several instances in the film if not correctly interpreted will leave the viewer wondering what the hell is going on, for instance when the song 'Where is my mind' starts playing, you know that this means the protagonist is about to temporarily escape the unpleasant reality of the brothel, (this reality is itself a facade created by Baby Doll to protect her from the reality of the lunatic asylum) what is not so evident and something that many seem to have missed is the fact that this song, which is the backbone of the movie asks the question quite literally, not just where is my mind at the moment, but what is the mind. It might be something of a stretch to suggest that this film raises deep philosophical questions about the nature of the Ego but those who have not understood that it does at least tip it's metaphorical hat in the direction of Descartes (I think therefore I am) and his 'Wax Argument' have seen only the surface and will come away from this film feeling like they have watched something with no real storyline. The reality is that they have watched the film and only understood a small part of the story, the irony here is that this ultimately is what the film is trying to say, you might think you know what is going on, you might think this is about scantily clad girls who perform for the benefit of an almost exclusively male audience, but if that is what you think then you have only seen the first reality, and you unlike Baby Doll, have failed to escape, and that is the Sucker Punch that the title refers to. Because of the complex nature of this film many will not understand what they have seen and write it off as style over substance, but this film is almost certainly guaranteed to one day be considered a cult classic.<br/><br/>And as to the questions, what is the mind and what is reality? Maybe, they are the same thing.... You decide."
"jopescu","9","4","7","12 April 2011"," Great Movie - Promises and Delivers well
","Sucker Punch, just watched it, so the main plot elements are still in my mind as I write this review. First off, unlike what some think, I feel that this is one of the better movies released in this few years. I have considerably high expectations for movies that I watch, and I am glad to say that Sucker Punch met my expectations. CG effects aside, the story can be considered to be quite emotional, with the many turns and twists, ups and downs in the story aptly reflected in the characters' emotions and expressions. In my opinion, this is how I interpret the story. The basic foundation of the entire movie is, I feel, a story about freedom. This is supported through the 'hallucinations' and thoughts Baby Doll have while dancing. The first one when they attempt to get the compound map is that of the girls being Anti-Nazi fighters. The fact that they take on what seems to be the entire military might of the Nazis, can be interpreted, in my opinion, as a reflection of the Freedom fighters in WWII against the Nazis. All in all, subtle reflections of the fight for freedom can be seen throughout the story. That's why I don't really agree with the people who say that Sucker Punch is a mindless movie with girls and guns. In my opinion, I feel that this movie is one that is full of subtle ideas and symbols - one that can be compared favorably to other movies, like Inception. As for the girls and guns, that might just be the way Zack Snyder wants to bring his message across, which I don't have any fault with.<br/><br/>In conclusion, great movie, 4/5, a must-watch for movie-goers who want a movie which stays and lingers long after the viewing."

","I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this gem of a film. I went in to the cinema not expecting much, because of all the bad reviews it received, but came out pleased and surprised and baffled at the same time as to why it was slashed by the critics. The most common arguments by the critics was that it lacked a story line,good dialogue &was demeaning to women. This is completely and utterly wrong. Anyone with half a brain would pick up the storyline although it could be interpreted differently, the dialogue was appropriate to the film genre,(u don't expect them to speak in a 17th century Shakespearan style)& I thought it was empowering to women.Yes the girls were in tight, cleavage baring attire most of the time but the film sent out a message of ""Never give in"" & ""Fight for your rights and your freedom"".

","What can I say. I sat for the whole time wondering what would happen next.<br/><br/>This film is perfection, we knew from the outset what the end would be, but for the whole time I hoped I was wrong.<br/><br/>Zach Snyder used the 'It Was All a Dream' with precision. It wasn't a dream at all. It was a fantasy wrapped around what actually occurred. And if her fantasy was of being in a whore house, what were the real terrors they had to endure in the ward. This is confirmed to us when the Orderly said that he wasn't going to help the girls any more.<br/><br/>I watched the movie about an hour ago, and I cannot stop attempting to translate the fantasy back into reality. As I think about it now, I think that every time she dances, this is actually the time when she is being abused.<br/><br/>A perfect use of CGI. Loads of it, and mixing images of war from across time and legends. I love the huge detailed backdrops just like the films by Kazuaki Kiriya; Casshern and Goemon.<br/><br/>I left the cinema feeling a little sad. Great movie that has everything!<br/><br/>Zach Snyder, can you please remake Shogun Island(Raw Force), you did a great job with Dawn of the Dead. Thanks."
"s_campanale","7","4","7","2 April 2011"," Original and Bold but maybe not what audiences wanted
","Many have proffered their own interpretations, and this is just my own.As many have said, I believe the film is all a fantasy taking place in ""Sweet Peas"" head, a cathartic fantasy designed to help her expunge her demons and overcome her psychological problems, perhaps with the aid of a counsellor/therapist (The Carla Gugino character?) What these ""traumas"" may be is unclear, but they probably involve sexual violence and or/guilt, and the accidental death/harm of a younger sister, since this same act occurs twice in the movie, both in romanticised ""dying to protect from harm"" scenarios. Her desire to return home though may mean that the violence of the films many stereotyped sexual predators may be external to the family unit (Date rape?) Many seem to take it for granted that the ""50s Asylum"" level of reality is the ultimate ""reality"", but I suggest that it too is just another fantasy level – being just as much a caricatured surreal demi-world as the Burlesque theatre or the WWI battlefields – which explains why so many things that happen there don't make sense. I believe that, as with some interpretations of INCEPTION, the whole thing is being concocted in some other layer of reality which we never get to see. Also people complain that aside from Sweet Pea and her sister Rocket, none of the other characters are fleshed out or real, which would support this interpretation since Sweet Pea is her own avatar, while her sister (idealised version?) is made from many genuine memories of a real person, whereas the others are just shades, faces from a crowd given a generic role to play. All of the girls (bar Rocket) are elements of Sweet Peas own personality, actresses in her cathartic experience. Each has a role to play, and it was interesting for example that in each fantasy, ""Amber"" is the pilot, a role usually evoking control, but not much was made of it.""Baby Doll"" who is erroneously introduced to us as the heroine (Which she is, even though she does not exist!) is Sweet Peas own personal guardian angel (as per the narratives). As many have said, she seems to have almost no character, no lines, no expressions and looks oddly like a doll. I believe that she may actually very well be just that – A Doll! Perhaps a beloved childhood companion, someone to protect and to give comfort during the dark times, a mouthpiece for her own desires and wants (her role here..) and someone would could be put into danger (as dolls often are) as she is here. She is a safety valve to at once remove Sweet Pea from her own perils and anxieties, now given full human form to become once again Sweet Peas ""other voice"" and the heroine of her adventure, her saviour. Her symbolic ""death"" at the end, rather than the expected rescue and revenge, may also represent the death of childhood and innocence, and the Sweet Peas acceptance of her role as an adult (and her return to her milieu as an adult) This fantasy world created by Snyder is, to his credit, an authentically adolescent one, a credible window into a how a teenager would see the world, and a modern one at that. Her fantasies are actually rather mundane and pedestrian (another popular complaint) and also all second hand and acquired. The World War 1 sequence is exactly how a teenager might imagine the war, all Zeppelins and Fokker Triplanes, with a ""good vs evil"" idea of the conflict that makes the Germans into literal monsters (rather like the imagined Persians in 300) The Samurai scene and the girls uniforms are all borrowed from Manga, the dragon scene is unashamedly the result of someone who has been excitedly reading/watching ""THE LORD OF THE RINGS"", and the final scene of ticking bombs and evil robots another movie/computer game take, also a way of reliving her sister tragedy within generically comfortable boundaries. Even the Asylum and the Burlesque are what someone who had been watching the odd old movie might imagine those worlds to be like, with their stock baddies, bad doctors and Zoot Suit gangsters. Sex is also a central theme here, the fear of sex (sexual predators), the power of her own burgeoning sexuality (the dances) and the threat/possible experience of sexual violence. The twin threats her Baby Doll avatar faces, deflowering and Lobotomisation, are both distinctly phallic threats involving forced penetration, again mirroring a fear of sex (That her Baby Doll actually is lobotomised and seemingly invites it would again suggest acceptance of sex) The Glenn wise man is a clear mythopoetic ""guide"" and may be either a kindly uncle or teacher, or perhaps even her own father. The finale, still a fantasy, shows her accepting her return home as a fully formed young woman, having overcome her fears and doubts and possible terrible experiences, with the most oft used metaphor, the bus (driven by her protecting father figure)/ That's my take on it anyway. It may be right, part right, or totally wrong, but I guess Snyder wants us each to have our own ""correct"" personal interpretation of it, hence the ambiguity. That the film is initially proving a box office and critical bomb is unsurprising, and will probably spend a few years in the wilderness before being ""re-evaluated"" as all greats are. Alas this film is being currently sold as an action packed Saturday day adventure, when it's really a dark, somewhat joyless journey through a tormented teenagers angst, and audiences are perhaps rightly feeling cheated"

","You have to understand what kind of movie this is to appreciate it. There is a specific target demographic that a movie like Sucker Punch shoots for...I can't say that I was enthralled about this movie as I was about 300, but Zack Snyder still captured my attention well enough to meet my relative expectations visually (I wasn't as drawn in by the storyline). I think this would have fared better in my eyes if I was about 5 or 6 years younger. I was much bigger into video games and comics even at that point in my life, but just haven't found the time for it as I've grown up, had a more serious career and family. Overall, I'd say that this a cool action, OK acting, better than average storytelling, and a fairy decent script (the best parts were all of the promotional trailers and cool concept art that have so frequently become the staple of a Zack Snyder Film (strongly hinting Frank Miller artistic vibes)."

","I love the movie. Great idea. I have been anticipating the movie since I first saw the preview last year with the music of Silversun Pickups. <br/><br/>The movie is about a girl who gets thrown into an insane asylum and how she internally deals with it. First - the movie plays a bit like a video game and maybe that is on purpose. But it is a very very cool video game and I wanted these scenes to last a little longer. The problem I had was that the director didn't string the scenes all that well together. It's noticeable but it is minor. I see how it is very heavily influence from Watchmen. SECOND- The music for the movie is ON POINT!! The director not only choose the music, and some of the music may sound familiar, but he has different artists singing. Music and visuals works well together. I can tell you, it is as different of a movie that I expected it to be, so that is a good thing. I just wish the writing was a tad bit better... this movie felt short like it was missing something. But I really like people who go for it and who don't make cookie cutter movies.

It's not enough to acknowledge that these tropes in movies (and video games) exist and make a movie that supposedly satirizes these tropes. ""Ironic"" sexism is still sexism. Humor does not excuse reprehensibly shallow representations of women in the media, and giving women guns and placing them in a traditionally macho male fighting role does not make them ""strong female characters"".<br/><br/>I am highly disappointed that Snyder is directing Wonder Woman, as he will certainly bring his peculiar skill of living in complete and utter denial of his blatant sexism to the table in the latest DC installment."

","It doesn't take a genius to write a better screenplay than Sucker Punch's. It is trite and whimsical, and is overloaded with video-game-like CGI, Halloween costumes, and cheesy lines. The actress playing the central character looks clueless in some scenes, maybe because of bad direction or her bad acting; anyhow the audience was laughing at her and in moments of the movie which should have been dramatic, if not tragic. I understand Snyder was going for the 'anime' type of action-fantasy movie, but the way he directed and wrote this movie just doesn't flow. Maybe Anime belongs to the world of... animation exclusively (that's for another debate), nevertheless Sucker Punch was a dreadful movie experience. Even today's video games have better original storyline, plots, characters and concepts. Overall Sucker Punch is a mere pastiche and plagiarism of many great previous movies: in SP, you suddenly find yourself watching a Samurai-fighting scene (borrowed from some Anime), robots and girls in skirts fighting in sets imported from 'Path of Glory'(??!), in other scenes you find ogres and sets from 'Lord of the Rings'... The soundtrack makes it even worse and is just wrong, plagiarizing classic pop songs that it uses. One can only conclude that Snyder has little imagination and questionable storytelling skills, and that the reason why 300 and Watchmen were decent movies can be attributed to that fact that he simply copied the comic books/novels, frame for frame, word for word; while in the case of Sucker Punch, since it's his own original writing and idea, this one fails."

","instead of Lisbeth Salander, Americans get Babydoll. There is no sweet revenge, just self-annihilation. I would not recommend this to anyone who is, or knows, a woman, or anyone else for that matter, who has been physically abused. The idea that a young woman's revenge fantasy is to wear short skirts and heels to destroy the fictional/imagined/dreamt ""bad men"" is baffling. This is a movie - the script could take the audience in any number of directions, but to end the movie with the victim accepting/welcoming a lobotomy is so disturbing. Why didn't the script writers have the girls go after the men/people who put them in the asylum in the first place? I was so disappointed - it could have been such a good movie."
"stellwilly","1","7","15","31 March 2011"," yuk
","Sure - Zack Snyder is entitled to get aroused by the idea of young girls getting battered, murdered, raped, forced into prostitution and lobotomized. Sure - he's entitled to dress up his sick fantasies in push up bras, hot pants, fishnets, stilettos, and false eyelashes. And sure, it's a free country, so Snyder can delude himself into thinking that his flimsy derivative script is deep. (Did he pay Nolan a license fee for the dream within a dream within a dream gimmick?) But please please please, someone make him stop spouting all that BS about female empowerment! He wouldn't understand female power if it kicked him in the ass. SuckerPunch falls only a few steps short of kiddie porn. How very sad that watching fantasy girls get brutalized is what appeals to the ""young male demographic"" in the US, when so many flesh-and-blood women around the world are really and truly suffering all the crimes that seem to titillate Snyder and his ilk."

","First of all, to all you people who loved this movie, I respect your opinion. But seriously, I find it hard to find a single good thing about this movie. Being a fan of 300 and Watchmen I refused to believe the reviews. Reviews that burned down this movie. Surely a man who made such great movies cannot create such a monster of a flick? How wrong I was. I should have listened. They were right. I encourage everyone to think for themselves but in this case, believe what you read or hear about Sucker Punch. At least believe the bad reviews. Save your money for a good movie. Do not spend it on this. And why is it so bad? let me sum it up in 1 simple line. Before you can have a story within a story within a story, you should have a story to start with, just special effects does not make a story. Mister Snyder needed ""to go Deeper"" with this story before he started shooting."

","I just came back home after watching this fantastic movie and I saw the interview with the director Zack Snyder. What I was thinking he said from the beginning...nowadays almost everybody has home everything necessary to watch movies in very good conditions so why bother going to a theater, pay a ticket to watch something? Well movies like this is WHY. <br/><br/>I was lucky to see this film at IMAX (without the 3d crap) and it was an amazing experience. An audio-visual feast I won't soon forget and honestly I can't wait to watch it again. The fantasy action scenes are breathtaking and the soundtrack (one of the best I have heard in a while) makes them almost perfect. <br/><br/>I'm pretty sure many critics will bash this film in their reviews. My advice:IGNORE THEM! Just go enjoy this and have fun. I have watched a huge number of movies in my life until now and something like this is always good to remember us sometimes you watch a movie just for pure entertainment. <br/><br/>P.S.

","This is the stupidest movie I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot of movies. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but probably the second worst. It is though, by far, the stupidest.<br/><br/>Everything about it is just terrible. Well, actually the intro had potential, but then it just became a horrible mess of plot holes and bad directing.<br/><br/>I mean I didn't expect much from the trailer or the poster, but it was way worse than I could ever dream of.<br/><br/>I kept wanting to shout ""Why are you doing that?! That serves no purpose! It doesn't help you achieve your goals!"". Examples:<br/><br/>Why didn't they do anything when the cook killed Rocket? The music comes back on and she.... continues dancing? NOBODY'S LOOKING AT YOU! YOUR FRIEND NEEDS HELP RIGHT THE FOOD NOW!<br/><br/>Train going to city, has bomb on, will explode. Uh... so blow up the track! Get *on* the train, what are you KIDDING ME?<br/><br/>Airplane going round and round when there's a dragon down there. Yeah, that's clever.<br/><br/>So you're sent to a mental institution. You make up a dream world to escape from your situation. You make up a dream world WHERE YOU ARE AN ABUSED PROSTITUTE. That's like sitting in a boring meeting daydreaming about being in ANOTHER BORING MEETING.<br/><br/>And the directing is equally horrible. When I loudly complained about this afterwards someone pointed out that the writer and director are the same person. Makes sense.<br/><br/>He's also guilty of extreme overuse of ""filming into a mirror, zoom in, the mirror is now the 3D scene"" and similar suspension-of-disbelief- killing methods.<br/><br/>No sex or boobs to make up for it either. There was only the hint of a hint of a euphemism for sex. And the PG rating prevented any blood worth mentioning. Fighting scenes - terrible. The less said about them the better.<br/><br/>And ""your will be unprepared""... but... you just prepared me. It's like ""prepare to be surprised"".<br/><br/>Parting words: (something like) ""Go out and fight!"". What are you, 12? Why? I guess if the people in the movie performed actions completely unrelated to their goals I guess we in real life should too?<br/><br/>By the way, yes I did see all the hints about deeper meaning and who's real and who's not, but it was all just half-hearted that you'd think the director/writer just threw a bunch of stuff up there to see what would stick (or possibly did it by accident). Nothing did.<br/><br/>The only thing that makes sense about this movie is that it premiered on April 1."

However, as always, Snyder delivers such a visual treat that I didn't care too much about the shortcomings and just sat back and enjoyed the action in the dream-world created by Browning's character. The movie moves at a great pace and features some fantastic action choreography, none more spectacular than the girls fighting robots on a train.<br/><br/>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Sucker Punch and think all Zack Snyder fans will too."
"Marter2","8","8","18","25 March 2011"," It's Quite Enjoyable
","Within the first few minutes of ""Sucker Punch"", I wanted to shed a tear for the production. Not because of its quality, which looked fine right off the bat. No, I wanted to cry because of some of the events depicted on-screen. It's a film that gets off to a saddening beginning, which I believe helps to work in its favour by the time it concludes.<br/><br/>The opening scene shows us a much maltreated Baby Doll (Emily Browning), and her kid sister. Their mother has just died, and custody of them has been given to their stepfather. He's, to put it bluntly, not a nice man. Things happen under his watch, leading to the death of Baby Doll's sister. She gets blamed, and sentenced to serve a term in a mental institution. Unfortunately for her, her stepfather has paid what essentially amounts to a prison a large sum of money to have her lobotomized. She only has days left before the doctor comes to perform the procedure. She decides she's not going down without a fight.<br/><br/>This is when things start to get weird. Baby Doll very well might be insane, as a lot of the film happens within her mind. There are two stages in her mind: A brothel where she and a few other girls are forced to dance for customers, and a war field where she teams up with these same girls to fight off all sorts of enemies, ranging from orcs to undead German soldiers. In this second world, she finds the way she'll escape from the asylum; she needs to gather a few magical items and use them in one grand escape plan.<br/><br/>How she plans to capture these items requires some of the other people at the brothel. There are four other girls there, and while Baby Doll dances for some of the clients--apparently they are unable to take their eyes off her while she dances, although we never get to see her dance-- the other girls will steal these items. While the theft is going on in the brothel level, the audience is treated to grand-scale action sequences with all of the girls wielding guns, samurai swords, mechs and airplanes. Never a dull moment, right?<br/><br/>That last question of mine seems to be one of the main things that director Zack Snyder wanted to answer, and make sure that he focused on, while creating ""Sucker Punch"". He may have actually gone a tad overboard in making sure that the audience isn't bored. While the fight sequences are all interesting, and they are certainly all varied from one another, the enemies never seem to have much of an ability to harm any of the girls. There was a quote in the film about a child sitting at the edge of a sandbox while the other children play with his toys. The enemies in the film feel like toys. They get cut apart, gunned down and easily defeated without so much as a scratch on any of the female leads.<br/><br/>But the battles against them certainly are interesting. Baby Doll, armed with a samurai sword and a handgun, initially isn't up to the idea of taking control and actually fighting back against oppression. In the first 10 minutes of the film, you are hard-pressed to get a single word out of her. By the time she enters her second imaginative state--the one with big battlefields--she begins to take control. She becomes a leader of a squad, and has to act the part of a leader. If you want, you could say that Snyder mixed in a coming of age story within ""Sucker Punch"", with Baby Doll having to mature far more quickly than she wants, as she is faced with difficult situation after difficult situation.<br/><br/>The most important thing that ""Sucker Punch"" had to do is be entertaining. It is. Or at least, I can say that I really had a good time while watching it. The action scenes could best be described with the words ""visual spectacle"", as they look fantastic. Fans of Zack Snyder's work know that there will be a lot of slow motion used, and that is exactly what happens. It's still somewhat excessive, but because the film looks so nice, you usually don't even notice that it's being used; you like looking at the scenery so much that taking a longer glance at a particular shot is something that you want to do.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, (and in a film like this, the acting isn't that important), I thought that the leading cast did a fine job with what they were given. There's some heart behind each one of their performances, and in the emotional scenes of the film, that comes through.<br/><br/>Even though the most important part of an action film like ""Sucker Punch"" is its entertainment value, there's an interesting enough story going on behind the action scenes. Whenever Baby Doll stops dancing and we return to the brothel, we remember that there is a plot about the girls' escape going on, and it all flows back to you wonderfully. And without spoiling the ending at all, I will just say that it--and looking back, the rest of the film as well--will make you think, giving you a desire to re-watch it.<br/><br/>""Sucker Punch"" is a good film for two main reasons: It's entertaining, and it has an interesting enough story to make the action sequences mean something. The acting is fine, the visuals are incredible, the plot will leave you thinking, and the action scenes are unique and fun to watch. Had the girls' been put in actual danger more often, then perhaps we would have an excellent film on our hands. As it is, ""Sucker Punch"" is one of those films that you'll either really enjoy, or really dislike. I fall into the former category, and I say to give it a shot."

Much more than meets the eye, I promise.<br/><br/>The worlds created as babydoll (how ironic to name a victim of such abuse such an innocent name) battles her trauma and inner demons, as she locks herself inside, are spectacular to say the least, humongous in size and obsessive in detail. <br/><br/>Even the faux-centerpiece of the movie, the action scenes, have a certain flow to them that is very well built and very properly held together. <br/><br/>I also loved all the Matrix references, cracked me up a bit, can't wait for it to come out on some form of disk so I can more closely examine every bit and maybe figure more out of the metaphors and the metaphors inside the metaphors. (inception is kindergarten compared to this)<br/><br/>I'm really finding it hard to express my feelings in words about this movie but what I can say is this: it certainly made its mark on me... I'm still trying to understand it all, still affected by the powerful emotional scenes the movie is filled with... <br/><br/>I quite honestly feel it is an incredible achievement, a true piece of art, and it deserves huge points for disguising it all under a wrapper of pop and cheesiness that only makes the actual content so much more hard-hitting."

Reality can be drab, and should be somewhat drab especially in a mental hospital in a non-specific past time. However, the drab reality of the mental hospital setting was equally stylized and comic-book like as the ballet school/jail/nightclub/whorehouse, or whatever it was supposed to be.<br/><br/>And that just turned the whole movie into a mess.<br/><br/>And what does the title even MEAN? It could have been called FLIGHTS OF FANCY, or HELL HOLE, or BRAIN DRAIN, or FIGHT TO BE FREE, or YOU HAVE ALL THE WEAPONS YOU NEED, or any one of many other titles that would have been WAY more appropriate.<br/><br/>But I will give it a 3 for the extremely competent CGI work and the great music choices.

","Now after watching a few interviews and discussions on TV and the internet I have discovered one thing: most critics do not enjoy the movies the general public seems to love. Why is this? Movie critics think way to much about the movies and they cannot enjoy it like most people can and will do. That is the problem with this movie. Most critics do not like fantasy movies due to being unrealistic. The thing is, ALL movies are unrealistic. Every single movie or story is either made up or has something added to a true story. Well, today I am turning away from the critics and giving this movie a two-thumbs up. I loved this movie. Especially for a guy in his teens with all the action, girls, and guns in the movie. However, you do have to figure some things out, which I don't mind. Especially with a slight twist at the end (spoiler). I love Zack Snyder's idea of escaping your reality and using your imagination to solve life's hard problems. This idea is enjoyment to the viewer, because normally we cannot do this in the real world. I will admit the imagination scenes are a little long, but there is not one boring part in the action scenes or the movie. If you ever want to see a movie, do not trust the critics. You are the only one to say if a movie is good or bad, not another person. Especially since most of them are to stuck-up to like any of the interesting movies."

"Jonny_Numb","7","5","10","11 April 2011"," Fascinating, Frustrating, and Hard to Shake
","Several days after viewing it, I have come to the conclusion that I like ""Sucker Punch."" I *think* I like it, anyway. At the very least, I have been unable to shake its alternatively bleak, exhilarating, and brazenly energized imagery from my frontal lobe. Coming from director Zack Snyder (who co-wrote the original script with Steve Shibuya), the notion of calling this film a vanity project is redundant, as Snyder is the whiz kid who gave us Green-Screened visual feasts like ""300"" and ""Watchmen"" (graphic-novel adaptations that, in the case of the latter, came very close to perfection) -- films that gorged themselves on a unique kind of visual beauty. The difference between a technical auteur like Snyder and the soul-dead commercial hackwork of, say, Michael Bay is a reliable core of character and plot to push the visuals along with a sense of purpose, no matter how disparate. Which is what makes the initial machinations of ""Sucker Punch"" somewhat jarring -- set in an anachronistic, parallel-universe America, where Babydoll (Emily Browning) is sent away to an all-girls asylum after attacking her grotesque pervert of an uncle, she is covertly signed away (by an equally lecherous orderly) and set to receive a trans-orbital lobotomy at the end of five days, thus setting into play an imaginary world that may be her only chance of salvation. Old-world notions of psychiatry, patriarchy, and the role of women in such a repressive society is not where Snyder's interest lies, though he does create some distinctive (if not particularly well-drawn -- probably the film's biggest flaw) female ass-kickers, literally battling it out against unfathomable odds. Like Terry Gilliam's oeuvre on a dose of David Lynch mindbender, ""Sucker Punch"" is a largely self-indulgent work -- frequently chaotic, but mostly fascinating; Snyder's interest in cohering the various combat sequences (which run the gamut from a steampunk vision of WWII, a Medieval siege, and a futuristic train populated by android assassins) into a consistent narrative is minimal at best, instead opting for an epic, ""bigger is better"" mentality that reinforces the film's ""against all odds"" schematic (it may not be subtle or original, but the driven vision of it all makes it fly). Like Gilliam's undervalued ""Tideland,"" ""Sucker Punch"" is destined for cult status -- and, unlike Tim Burton's lame interpretation of ""Alice in Wonderland,"" is never boring."
"D_Burke","5","5","10","9 April 2011"," ""Sucker Punch"" Is ""Inception"" Without Representation
","""Sucker Punch"" comes as a disappointment to me because the previews for the film looked really good. I love action movies, and a film where the heroine warriors are adolescent angst- ridden girls has to be unique. Unfortunately, ""Sucker Punch"" feels more like a video game or a music video: there are great special effects and action sequences, but they accompany a half-baked story line, underdeveloped characters, and a series of highly-stylized fantasy episodes that come out of nowhere and tie together poorly.<br/><br/>It's as if Zach Snyder made this film as an excuse to show such action sequences, because those sections of the film where girls are kicking ass are very well polished and are great eye candy. What we the audience really need to know is ""Why?"".<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a pretty blonde girl whose real name we never find out (Emily Browning). Through a montage, we learn that the girl's mother has died, leaving her with her sister and an abusive stepfather. When that stepfather attempts to abuse the younger sister, the blonde girl pulls a gun out on him, but accidentally shoots her sister instead.<br/><br/>In a plot devise seemingly ripped right out of ""Chicago"" (2002), the girl is sent to a mental institution with other girls her age, where she becomes psychoanalyzed by Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), the seemingly only well-meaning person to work in the facility. Dr. Gorski tells her students/patients to set their mind free by using their imaginations, and these girls seem to have more vivid imaginations than the good doctor gives them credit for.<br/><br/>In a confusing segway, the blonde girl goes from being in a mental institution to being a stripper in a seedy club. Her name becomes Baby Doll, her fellow patients are also erotic dancers, Dr. Gorski is a dance instructor, and the other institution workers are owners of the club, or pimps. Again, does this remind you of ""Chicago""?<br/><br/>Although this strip club is much nicer than the grim loony bin, Baby Doll still seeks escape. Once again, she imagines herself and four other acquaintances yielding swords and guns, and attacking faceless soldiers who stand in the way of obtaining five objects that will help her and the others escape. According to their imagined Obi-Wan-like mentor simply known as Wise-Man (Scott Glenn), the five objects they need are a map, a thing that makes fire, a knife, a key, and the last thing Baby Doll has to figure out for herself.<br/><br/>The plot synopsis is a headache to write about, and you can imagine what it's like to watch it. The truth is, the imagination synopses would have worked so much better if Dr. Gorski had actually TAUGHT these girls how to imagine, rather than just saying things like ""Open your heart and let your imagination take you."" That quote is not verbatim, by the way, but it's pretty close.<br/><br/>Plus, these girl characters are so underdeveloped that you don't get a sense of how they came up with these fantasies of kicking ass and taking names. It's not unusual for boys to fantasize this way. And yes, you're given a brief back story for Baby Doll, but it isn't enough because she literally doesn't talk for the first 20 minutes of the film. You don't know why she wants to escape, or what she's going to do once she does. Plus, once she kills her sister, which is something devastating and life changing in and of itself, it's never mentioned again in this movie.<br/><br/>Her fellow BFFs with ironic nicknames are not developed at all. Amber (Jamie Chung) and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgins) are no more than just pretty faces. Sisters Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) and Rocket (Jena Malone) have a back story, but it's not much of one. You learn that they ran away from home, but never why, how they ended up in an institution, or their ambitions besides leaving the place they're in right now.<br/><br/>Plus, Wiseman just pops up in their dreams, and seems to have no basis whatsoever. Why didn't Dr. Gorski guide these girls in these imaginings? Doing so would have given her far more clout as a mentor.<br/><br/>So ""Sucker Punch"" is a big miss. Although the action sequences are well made and enticing at times, it's almost as if Zach Snyder made these short films, and someone else tried to tie them together with a really undercooked story line. The ending is just confusing, and feels incredibly weak. A ""Chicago""-like song and dance number during the end credits feels just as random and out of place.<br/><br/>In addition to ""Chicago"", I was also reminded of ""Inception"" (2010) while watching this movie. While ""Inception"" had its confusing moments, it had a coherent story line, and at least you knew why people in that movie had the dreams they were having. It was also a lot deeper a story. ""Sucker Punch"" is just a music video in disguise as a feature film. The more people who make these kinds of movies, the longer MTV is going to go without showing music videos. Why bother, right?"

","Snyder brilliantly translates the story of a victimized girl who has been wrongfully incarcerated in an insane asylum and uses her creative imagination not only to escape the ruins of her life in her mind, but to hatch and execute a creative plan to escape the throngs of her captors in reality. Visually stunning and truly touching. Browning and Malone compellingly portray innocent femininity and strength without going overboard. For the girls: Girl Power. For the guys, hot chicks with loads of gun/sword play and action. Watching this film is like a stint in a daydream. Jump aboard the roller coaster and simply go for the ride. Recommended."
"blackmambamark","7","5","10","25 March 2011"," With everything turned up to 11, you kind of wished the delivery of the concept was the same way
","What's not to say about director Zach Snyder? So far, he hasn't missed. He pulled off the impossible by remaking a classic horror flick. He revolutionized the film industry with his amazing slo-mo techniques and incredible set designs in ""300"". And he helped recreate one of the greatest graphic novels of all time on film. Whats left you ask? How about an idea of his own? Sure he has the ability to glorify someone else's....but can his own concept match his eye.<br/><br/>Well one things for sure, this certainly has the look of a Zach Snyder picture. By that of course i mean the action, which is next to flawless. You have your amazing slo-mo fighting sequences with hot baby doll ninja's and dragons and robots and nazi zombies.....it's any living man's virtual dream world. Combine that with beautiful set designs, pitch perfect sound mixing, absolutely amazing visual effects and an epic musical score that will rock the brain out of your skull.....it's almost too much to handle. You literally leave each action sequence as if you just got off a roller coaster.<br/><br/>But Mr. Snyder has done all the action before, we all know it was going to be fantastic. What about the story? Well.....the overall concept really is great. The way they attack it is good.......but that's the thing, with everything running at full throttle, you kind of want the story to be right there with it. It's almost as if they knew they had a great concept, but decided to focus on the action sequences with more precision.<br/><br/>You can also tell that they didn't pour that much heart into developing the story because aside from all the leading ladies being mouth watering, they all seemed at tad flat. There wasn't much depth to any of them, other than the fact that they are all locked in a mental facility and they can kick major ass with awesome weapons.<br/><br/>Bottom Line......to the eyes and ears, the movie really is something to marvel at. It is beyond stunning, a visual wonder. The story is good, but the delivery is not on par with it. It's not an overall disappointment. I thought it was pretty good. But, if you are like me, and you eat your eggs with salt, here's a quick comparison. Imagine you have your eggs for breakfast, but there is no salt. No salt, that's okay, i'll still eat em', they're really good.....but, they would have tasted a lot better if it had salt. Same thing with Sucker Punch."

","This film takes the title of the worst film I have ever seen.<br/><br/>1. Actors couldn't act. Simple. 2. Blatant contrived attempt at being deep, failed completely unless you're a Twilight fan. 3. Tarnished the name of a respectable director. 4. Obvious effort was given towards giving the dragged-along-boyfriend an erection by the sexual exploitation of the cast. 5. Severe lack of plot. 6. The cheesy narrator mentioning that ""everyone has a guardian angel"", thats not even relevant to anything within the film. <br/><br/>What this film has done is ruined its target market. If you are going for the teenage girl with no brain, take out the guns and fight scenes where you can see the crotch of the main character. If you are going for the teenage male then cut out the ""guardian angel"" because he won't ever be able to admit he has seen the film afterwards. No adults in their right mind would view this film willingly. And there is too much sex for children to view it too."

","Truly, instead of using a pick to lobotomize the main character, they should have just made her watch this film ten times.<br/><br/>Words cannot describe the mind-numbing awfulness of this film, but I'll start. A girl is put into an insane asylum by her father trying to get her money. As she waits to be lobotomized, she has a fantasy of being stuck in a strip-club/brothel where no one actually has sex or takes off their clothing. She conspires with the other inmates/dancers in an elaborate escape plan dragging them into fantasy scenarios where they are fighting dragons, zombies, giants and other seizure inducing CGI crap.<br/><br/>After the minority characters are killed for plot simplicity, we are dragged back into the real world with the lobotomy scene...

"aminjacoub","1","6","13","19 June 2011"," Where is my joystick?
","I am fan of director Snyder, mostly because of movie Watchmen, which I really liked a lot. However Sucker Punch left me with different opinion. The plot is really interesting, and the atmosphere is mostly like it is in 300 and Watchmen, but... the concentration of synthetic CGI effects (even band from time to time) with mixing all kinds of well known characters, concepts and suggestions from various movies (Orcs from Lord, Matrix, I Robot... etc etc) results in feel more like it is some kind of movie techno video game goulash.<br/><br/>The parts that are out of CGI sequences are fine, even the ending which is enjoyable. Because of those so much video game like parts I did not like the movie.<br/><br/>If you are classic movie concept lover you will probably avoid this, or maybe share the same opinion, maybe. Maybe I am too conservative? Fot the conclusion what I admire the most here is that I had great resolution without need of some ultra quality graphic card, and only thing that was missed was a joystick.<br/><br/>And what I really hate here is destroying the great Jefferson Airplane song: ""White Rabbit""."

","Zack Snyder is one of my favourite directors at the moment, and on the directing front in this film he does quite well. However, the script and story for this film seem to be nothing more than a case for his crazy (but pretty awesome) fight sequences.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","6","13","1 April 2011"," Video game, but not entirely brainless
","This may be how things work in the creation of this CGI-intense action flick. Someone designs four video games first, featuring a group of hot sexy amazons fighting their way through an assortment of mostly faceless enemies, from orcs to Nazis to everything imaginable in between. Then, around these games, you construct the movie plot.<br/><br/>Be that as it may, the plot so constructed is not entirely brainless. First, think ""Girl Interrupted"" (1999). Prelude to the asylum however is a familiar evil step-father story the details of which I'll spare you with. Anyway, our protagonist Baby Doll (that's the names with which she is known) ends up in the asylum where she promptly forms and alliance with four girls in a quest to escape: a pair of sisters Sweet Pea and Rocket, plus two almost mandatory minority roles Blondie (ironically, Latin) and Amber (a little less ironically, Asian). I'll come to them later.<br/><br/>Here's where we see some cleverness, as there are two levels of imagination (or hallucination, if you prefer that), which leads you to wonder if that is Inception inspired. The cleverness is in that the first level is subject to two interpretations one of which obviously is Baby Doll's own imagination. The other is that the asylum actually uses theatrical therapy, so what happens here could be reality i.e. what is being played out on stage. What happens here is that the asylum is in fact a secret high class entertainment club with all the girls as dancers. Regardless of which interpretation, the story is the same – Baby Doll, taking over form the existing leader Sweet Pea, plans the escape quest which requires them to first acquire four objects: a map, a fire starter (lighter in this case), a knife and key.<br/><br/>The plot line leading into the CGI video sequences is idiotically simple but functional. When certain music is turn on and Baby Doll begins to dance, it is so mesmerizing to the audience that the other girls can go about acquiring these objects. We never see her dance though, because that is when the CGI video sequences are brought up, as something going through her mind while she dances. The story enfolds with predictable predictabilities including betrayals, deaths, sacrifices etc. The final ""twist"", if you can call it that, is where you find out (if you have not already done so) who the voice over narration you heard in the very beginning really is. That, of course, you have seen in other movies.<br/><br/>For a flick of this genre, the cast is not shabby at all. In the customary ""wise man"" role is veteran Scott Glenn who needs no introduction. Playing the chief villain is Oscar Isaac who recently turned in an eye-catching performance as Prince John, then later King John, in ""Robin Hood"" (2010). The 5 girls have their credentials. Vanessa Hudgens (Blondie) is High-School-Musical-famous. Jamie Chung (Amber) was seen recently in genre flicks ""Dragonball"" and ""Sorority row"". Jena Malone (Rocket) with a short hair style that looks suspiciously like an effort to invoke a Meg Ryan persona, would be remembered by ""Pride and prejudice"" (2005) as Lydia Bennet, the sister with most youthful spirit. Abbie Cornish's (Sweet Pea) outstanding performance as Fanny Brawne in Jane Campion's ""Bright star"" (2008) has caused critics to unanimously acclaimed her as the new Kate Winslet. No such demand on her acting abilities in this movie. Last but not least, in the lead role is Emily Browning, who held her own in ""Lemony Snicker's a serious of unfortunate events"" (2004) acting against the likes of Jim Carrey and Meryl Streep, at the age of 16."
"jakoson7","10","6","13","29 March 2011"," This movie is not for stupid people!
","To all who say that this has a terrible, if not nonexistent, storyline, they are WRONG! This movie has a very clever storyline that exceeds much of the Hollywood junk we get today.<br/><br/>Yes, the emphasis of the film is that hardcore fantasy scenes from Snyder's own imagination, but it does relate to what's happening outside the character's imagination. She's in a mental asylum, so don't be surprised of what she imagines of.<br/><br/>Another VERY ANNOYING thing from other reviews are that they DO NOT understand the story. Not to give spoilers, but I think the story is somewhat like Shutter Island combined with Inception (not the horror or action elements, but the psychological element).<br/><br/>The ending may be hard to grasp for viewers. You have to be intelligent to understand it. From the previous review, the reviewer questioned why it goes from ""being a prisoner to being a burlesque dancer"". He obviously did not understand the symbolic element of the storyline.<br/><br/>I have to admit, there was not enough action to make up for the plot development. Don't listen to people who say the movie is pure eye candy; it's actually a well designed maze of twists and turns.<br/><br/>On the action side, IT WAS AMAZING! This movie has by far the best made CGI action sequences I have ever seen. Well timed slow motion shots, excellent angles and perspectives, and slick moves. If you thought 300 had well choreographed fighting, you have to see this.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this movie. But don't go and only expect hardcore action with a stupid plot. Open up your mind like you did when you watch inception, because this movie is all about the story."

The cast was great too. Emily Browning was a perfect choice and so were all the other girls. You felt a connection with them and really cared about what happened to them.

","Don't let the fairly consistent badgering of unappreciative and inattentive viewers discourage you from seeing this Incredible film. You may hear people say, ""It was too confusing and made no sense"" I just watched the film for the first time, and it was crystal clear to me. The reason a lot of people don't like it, is because, much like inception, it is very deep into multi-layering of the plot. THERE IS A PLOT! No spoilers, but it has a very inception like ""dream-within-a-dream"" kind of storyline. You just have to pay attention to whats going on. The way Zach Snyder weaves the intricate plot through thoughtful foreshadowing and shocking moments of adrenaline rush will keep you guessing even after the credits roll.<br/><br/>Aside from the deep (depth) story, the real crowd pleaser, and the reason you should come see it is the other-worldly visual effects, the adrenaline delivering action, and the skin-tingling and luscious beauties. Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, and of course, Vanessa Hudgens -- These are the up-and-coming Hollywood hotties of my micro-generation -- the women I'll likely have pin-ups of on my walls in the coming months. <br/><br/>The graphics are simply awesome.

"Romwell","9","8","19","26 March 2011"," More than I expected
","To be frank, I only expected mindless B-movie action an graphics with scantily clad girls and phantasmagoria of kitchen-sink approach to fantasy battle scenes.<br/><br/>I got that, but there was something more. While there was a video game-like linearity and predictability to the plot, there were some surprises for me which made it a great experience. The cinematic battles (and the movie itself) feels like a mash-up of One Flew over The Cookoo's Nest, Matrix, Kill Bill, Lord of The rings and Heavy Metal all at once, transformed into a video game first and then onto the big screen. The fact that it worked so well on a visual level and actually fit together was interesting.<br/><br/>However, it's the overall idea was what got me: the idea of escaping to the world of fantasies while the world around you is unpleasant, and the interplay between the two. I see this movie as a contrast between the reality and the escapism of dreams and imagination, and how, ultimately, the real life takes upper hand. Granted, it could be implemented better without being a Kill-Bill-type movie, but that was an unexpected dimension in a movie of this type.<br/><br/>What probably got me most were the little details in the dreams which corresponded to the real-world details in a non-obvious way. While the girls were directly embedded into the dreams, it takes some thought to realize that the wise old guy is also a character from real life, and who that character is. Likewise, in the final scene you need to figure out which part is taking place in the imagination, and what that tells you about the events.<br/><br/>I could probably draw a parallel with films like Le Magnifique, where a writer played by Belmondo embeds real-life people he interacts with into his fiction, although that would be quite a stretch. <br/><br/>The movie would be appealing to video game-loving young guys, and, in fact, would probably make a great video game. It is deliberately over-the-top, male-oriented, with all the pretty girls, weaponry and stunning visuals. <br/><br/>However, I think there is a deeper back story about a weak girl who is overpowered by the circumstances of life around her, which. This story, which is easily overlooked due to abundance of visuals, which makes this movie stand out and work for a wide audience.<br/><br/>In short: I came for the girls, swords and zeppelins, but came out with One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest."

A dragon chasing a plane?! It looked like it would be aesthetically pleasing, and delightfully cheesy.<br/><br/>Instead, we're given another one of Zack Snyder's creepy glamorization of rape threats.<br/><br/>It was just gross. I consider myself to be pretty thick skinned, but I just felt really uncomfortable throughout the whole movie. I don't even mind feeling uncomfortable if the story is good, but it just wasn't. It also wasn't empowering at all. If the movie was just the action sequences, it would be passable and could even be potentially seen as being empowering to women. But all of the implied rape and the threats of rape were just totally unnecessary and didn't do anything for the story at all.<br/><br/>Hanna just came out and is a much better film for so many different reasons - but I think what I'm most excited about is the fact that she was so strong and the antagonists were scary without being creepy and threatening her with rape. I'm just really tired of Zack Snyder being such a creep in the name of ""art,"" especially when the art is no good."

It's not a hard movie to follow, trust me. From the very beginning the film moves right along without taking unnecessary breaks or pulling its audience from the story. Everything from the music to the introduction of key characters was well conveyed. The direction of the plot is fairly obvious from the start so its viewer isn't stumbling on confusing side stories or any other form of useless information. Sucker Punch was stunning and thoroughly enjoyable to say the least.

"bowmanblue","8","3","5","27 December 2015"," Well... I liked it (please don't hate me!)
","I'll start off by saying that most people seemed to absolutely HATE 'Sucker Punch.' I didn't. I guess I'm weird. But I can live with that. Zack Snyder, normally best known for only directing his films, now writes AND directs one, too. Sucker Punch is the result. And, whereas I choose to mainly just enjoy it for its silly action sequences, I can see why the haters had such a field day tearing it to pieces.<br/><br/>So... what's it about? Er, good question. There's a girl. She's accused to murdering someone she didn't and sent to an institution for the mentally insane. Do they still do that? I don't know. The film's time period is woefully unspecified. Anyway, once there she teams up with four other hot girls and they fight German steam-powered zombies in First World War trenches, robots protecting a trainload of explosives heading into a futuristic city and Orcs. And I also think I remember giant monster-samurais. And then there's the bit about the girls working in a brothel. And gangsters. And they kill a mummy dragon's baby.<br/><br/>Do you think I'm making this up? I'm not. Basically, the film does try to cover many levels at once (with limited success). It's one of those movies which exists on many levels (not all of them real – many interpretational and symbolic). Some say it should have just stuck to one, but it doesn't, therefore it does tend to confuse and disorient a fair proportion of the viewers.<br/><br/>As a story, it's a bit of a mess. I can see that. I appreciate where the haters are coming from. However, I can't fault the awesome action sequences. They're amazingly shot and look like something out of the highest powered computer game ever made.<br/><br/>I think if I'd paid full price to watch it at the cinema I may feel a little short-changed. However, I saw it on DVD and I must have been in the mood just to watch hot girls slice apart Nazi samurais in giant mech-armour suits. That's the kind of level you need to set your brain on to appreciate it.<br/><br/>Don't think about story. Don't think about character development or deep and meaningful story arcs. Just watch the action scenes and enjoy the dark and brooding soundtrack. If Sucker Punch is an example of Zack Snyder's writing ability then perhaps he should stick to directing a little longer while he hones his art. However, it's still a lot of fun. If you're me."
"SeriousJest","8","3","5","2 April 2012"," An intelligent film with a blockbuster feel
","It's important that you understand from the outset that this film is not about dragons, machine guns, katanas, mechs, demons, or zombie Nazis. Instead, it is first and foremost about a young woman's quest to return home from a terrible, cruel place, and overcoming terrible situations through will, introspection, and the power of the mind. This could have been a much darker movie, focusing on the insane asylum, and a bunch of crazy, disheveled, medicated chicks trying to escape...but Snyder and Shibuya found a much more imaginative and entertaining way to tell their story. As I said above, the movie isn't about dragons, machine guns, katanas, mechs, demons, or zombie Nazis...but if you can work those things into it, why wouldn't you? Why not infuse the flick with martial arts, bombs, a high-class-whorehouse theme, awesome special effects and camera work, and a cool soundtrack? Why not transform the girls into sexy, confident, dressed up ass-kickers?<br/><br/>I can see how the brilliance of this film can be lost on some viewers. If you go in expecting a blockbuster action flick, you may focus more on the great audio/visual aesthetics, and not pay attention to the little nuances and references in the script that are so critical to really appreciating the movie's intelligence.<br/><br/>I will concede, however, that the PG-13 rating, a few cliché lines, and the casting choices for the patients gave this movie an intended-for- teenage-girls feel at times. Also, character development is thin, except for Browning's character. According to IMDb, Amanda Seyfried, Emma Stone, and Angelina Jolie were attached to this movie at some point. Too bad they didn't end up in this movie, because I feel that those three would have added credibility, veteran experience, and individual character beyond their roles.<br/><br/>Still, I was pretty impressed with Browning, who capably harnessed passion and non-verbal cues to convey the internal struggle that is so central to this film--I was completely captivated by her (and not just because she's extremely hot), but I didn't even realize until later that she didn't speak a line until about 20 minutes into the film, despite clearly being the centerpiece of all of those important, telling opening scenes. To that end, Gerard Plunkett was a very capable evil man of few words. Also, Scott Glenn was awesome in his David Carradine-like role of the Wise Man. The clear standout in this film, though, was Oscar Isaac. From low-budget, fast-talking hustler to ruthless, angry pimp, this guy was everything you could have wanted out of Blue Jones.<br/><br/>For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com"

If you were expecting a typical male action flick like '300' or 'Watchmen' then you couldn't be more wrong. At its core it's a story about women trying to escape the grasp of the evil males surrounding them. But don't think it's an easy watch: it's not. Sucker Punch is not happy nor bright, its overall tone very bleak and disturbing. There are numerous intense scenes, and a couple which will remain in your head long after the film is over. In contrast to the dark themes of this movie, there are also many positive themes, hope, courage, teamwork, love, risk and forgiveness. It appeals to me on many levels. Like 300 and Watchmen it is a visually stunning film, and it doesn't just rely on huge action set pieces to reel in the audience. It is well directed, has a good multi-layer plot and is a brilliant example of cinematography. I (as I'm sure you have) have read reviews for this film; you either love it, or hate it. People were dismissing it as stupid or degrading to women, but I don't care, it's a beautiful film. In terms of narrative style, this film is right up there with classics such as Memento and Inception. The film is blessed with amazing action scenes and brilliant CGI, and in a way it makes directors like James Cameron and Michael Bay look like amateurs. Sucker Punch wasn't Inception or The Matrix, and it wasn't trying to be. It asks many thought provoking questions People are being abused. What are you doing about it? Is reality a prison? Why are you here? Are you here to be ""corrected"" or to escape? Do you want to be free, or should you just shut up and let the guards continue to take advantage of you and the other prisoners? What will it take to escape? Are you willing to risk your life in the quest for freedom? Sucker Punch is mind numbingly brilliant; I can't put into words how much I enjoyed the film. You have to watch it with an open mind, and watch carefully, because the plot is multi layered and cleverer than you think it is. It's a fresh, haunting and mind blowing movie that MUST be seen. 9/10"

","***This review contains spoilers***<br/><br/>Sucker Punch. The main reason I was waiting for this film to release was that one of my favourite bands was supposed to have a song on its soundtrack...which it didn't in the end. <br/><br/>From the start, I went into this with high hopes, the trailer looked great. Not your usual film. Charlies Angels meets One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. It is strange and if you miss the beginning, you will get lost and confused. <br/><br/>Emily Browning played the main role of Babydoll. A girl who accidentally killed her own sister while trying to kill her abusive father. Placed in a sanitarium, she overhears that she is to be lobotomized. This is where it gets...confusing and strange. In her head, there are 3 worlds. Reality, a private strip club and a fantasy war zone. In order to escape the hospital, she retreats into these alternate realities in her mind to help. She is helped by 4 friends, also inmates in the sanitarium. Abbie Cornish(Sweat Pea), Jena Malone(Rocket), Vanessa Hudgens(Blondie) and Jamie Chung(Amber). All 4 fairly well established in TV and film. The acting of all 5 of these actors was good. Especially that of Emily Browning.<br/><br/>The Fight scenes are great. Special Effects also great. I have never seen a film like this before, and that is a good thing. Many films these days are simply rebooting or remaking old films because they can't think of anything that has not already been done. This film is New. Original. Unique. Took some guts to spend so much money on a project like this, so well done to them.<br/><br/>To end it, although for some this film may be just too strange and confusing, it is still well worth a watch."

Other than that, it kept my attention.The outfits weren't worse than what I've seen some girls on Nickelodeon wearing. if your older and not into the sci-fi thing, then this is not the movie for you, and you probably will think it's stupid. It's aimed towards the teenage audience, not towards thirty or forty year olds.It's a movie for those who want to escape from reality, and not a romantic comedy.

Of course as many have stated here, this is a love it or hate it film. And I have heard quite a few complaints about the film. One thing that no one has complained about, is the visual style of the film (unless they are not into the CG background that is).<br/><br/>But the story itself was always something people were arguing about. And while the story within a story isn't too complicated (almost like an Alice in Wonderland, but with more power and more consequences), it did put people off.

","Director Zack Snyder has been compared to a lot of classic filmmakers since his steady rise to the top of the Hollywood list. His most memorable blockbusters up until now, as you will most likely remember are the 2003 'Dawn of the Dead' remake, Spartan war fantasy '300' and the all comic-book movie shaming 'Watchmen.' Yes, I am a fan of his work but no I do not argue the man's genius in every case.<br/><br/>'Dawn,' I felt was a hastily put-together feature that failed to capitalise where modern filmmaking methods could have improved the original version and the only similarity was that both films had a shopping mall. Still, I like it. What he did improve was the sense of excitement, even though the story had been drastically simplified as an apparently necessary sacrifice.<br/><br/>'300' was not a great film in my eyes and I hated the use of almost two-dimensional looking CGI to portray a historic tale although he had his reasons for making it that way, particularly the influence of comic-book legend Frank Miller. After being treated to Troy, Kingdom of Heaven and the likes, I was left feeling sold short.<br/><br/>Then came 'Watchmen' and Snyder's true colours shone; a true talent for storytelling, a big appetite for character and plot twists and a gift for transferring a sense of sentimentality from studio to audience. In my eyes, this last title was a perfect display of lessons well-learned and skills well-matured.<br/><br/>'Sucker Punch' is literally a return to original form for the director and with all his perfected skills and impeccable eye for detail in tow. Here he tells a seemingly simple escape story, one that allows the audience's imagination to overstep the mark as the film unravels into an immensely complex trip through the daydreams of a tragically oppressed mind.<br/><br/>Baby Doll and her sister are child victims to an abusive step-father until one night, he crosses the line. So afraid for her sister, Baby Doll escapes imprisonment to rescue her sister only to find her dead. Refusing to take out violent revenge, the step-father blames her for her sister's death and has her imprisoned in an insane asylum. She immediately begins to withdraw into the limitless depths of her imagination to escape her grim reality, destined for the lobotomists operating chair, and hopefully to escape in reality.<br/><br/>But she recedes so far that she suddenly finds herself imprisoned in another reality where she is taken in by a group of captive women also looking for a way out. With the aid of a mysterious mentor (portrayed by legend film veteran Scott Glenn) they set about finding the means to escape their captors and tormentors through mind-blowing ventures into fantasy wars where the band of women fight with all the rage they've ever known.<br/><br/>Spending a lot of time entering these dream worlds and fighting side by side to go on with their secret plans, the film occasionally comes back to the second reality where the seemingly primary plot and narrative unfold bit by bit. But it is only towards the end that the story crashes back to reality so abruptly that, with all the plot points in place, we are dragged back to the feature's very title and literally sucker punched over and over again. This review needs no spoiler, it does what it says on the box, yet it generously offers so much more to the open mind and the sympathetic heart.<br/><br/>Snyder's 'Sucker Punch' is so many things at one time yet these things work harmoniously. It's a psychological drama and a chick-flick set inside a man-boy's video game.<br/><br/>Visually, you are inside a video-game of the highest calibre, in fact a mix of the very best there has ever been. But the drama within and around the octane-soaked action scenes and all this leading up to the jaw-dropping conclusion is enough to make even the most emotionally devoid man shed even a single tear. Try to figure out what it all means after you've seen it once or twice and the possibilities keep jumping in your face long after.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder has plenty years of cutting edge filmmaking left in him before he joins the distant-minded and long-past glorious Hollywood crowd but if he can ever top this one with something even more mind-blowing, I'll have to lobotomise myself just to be able to cope.<br/><br/>Accept no imitations!"

","This film was not at all what I expected. In all honesty I was beginning to be somewhat disappointed about halfway through the movie, but the film really brings it in for an amazing ending. Like others I expected something visually stimulating based on trailers, and this film goes beyond those expectations. I did think some of the action scenes were a little too long and too much focus on using slow-motion techniques with zooming in on details, but the film as a whole more than makes up for it. The story is an amazing one. I do wish they developed the background story more and at times I was wishing they made more obvious transitions between all of the alternate realities present, but upon seeing the film in it's entirety I think they did a great job overall. The story is heart-wrenching, and is one that makes you think about your own life. All in all, they may have done things a little differently than I wanted but in the end the film is absolutely NOT a letdown and leaves me really wanting to focus internally. Something I will definitely be adding to my collection."

","Whats with all the bashing and negative reviews? It seems like nowadays that the critics are acting up like whiny, sarcastic and unsatisfied customers with a thin trace of patience. Seriously, this movie was ******* awesome! Well...OK, I can agree that this film isn't that great but its sure one hell of a good punch. A punch so strong, it'll knock the senses out of you. Anyways, here is my review:<br/><br/>The Storyline: Basically, it's about a girl trying to escape a hospital for the mentally insane (Why females only? I'm guessing this hospital is for girls that are ""crazy?""-and-in-their-early-twenties-with-a-hot-body...hm?) and so she's trying to get other girls to do the same and all they need is a couple of items and they are all set...it sounds easy but it isn't so easy after all. So what does this have to deal with Nazi zombies, fire-breathing dragons, robots, huge-ass samurai warriors, etc? Well, whenever Babydoll (Emily Browning, the girl I was talking about) closes her eyes she imagines an alternative universe that has the same goals and objectives but in different situation. Zack Snyder wants us to see some sort of similarities between the two worlds (reality and fantasy) so what ever is happening in the fantasy world is happening in the real world, mostly involving the characters. Characters are: Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Amber (Jamie Chung) and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens). Let us not forget about Madame Gorski, ""love your accent by the way"" who is played by Carla Gugino. Mr. Blue (Oscar Isaac), who isn't a bad character but when he's acting like a b****, he becomes a *itch and you'll hate him after what he did. The story is (to me) well told and there are moments in which you just gasp in awe and in shock. Female Empowerment: The girls are just trying to play as what the guys in the film are seeing them as, sexy-ass sluts. But I think Zack Snyder is trying to tell us that females can be viewed as sex objects because a lot of people see them that way (reason why they wear tight, barely naked outfits in the real world and also in the fantasy world) but the females just don't see themselves that way and so the fantasy world helps us to see that they are just a band of females trying to survive so they'll do anything to survive. Nuff said. BTW: ""Don't mess with these chicks, they'll kill you."" Visuals: Impressive and well worth my time especially the fantasy world, when the 5 of them are trying to complete each dangerously-crazy missions. Characters: The guys are punks and even though (sometimes) Babydoll looks like she's about to die, she has a moments of ""lets beat the crap out of them."" The girls are dimensional and very serviceable; they laugh, cry, yell and scream (Good one Abbie) so nothing outstanding but...serviceable.<br/><br/>Overall, Didn't want to talk too much because it's just a film but the critics hit it hard and I didn't think it was fair for Zack Snyder or for any new directors that make up their own ideas to be assaulted with bad reviews (come on ""4 zero stars.""). Anyways, I think Zack Snyder stepped up a notch from his other movies like taking flight with the owls or seeing tight-thong warriors in a bloody battle. This one was just...it blew my mind. I give him credit and just for you guys to know, it ends with a happy but unusual note. I know that Zack Snyder likes to darken his movies and this one was pretty much unnerving (sometimes even depressing).<br/><br/>An 8.5"

","My first words will be, if you don't know what art is, you won't like this movie. This is more than a story, it's packed with art and a deeper meaning, I'll probably have to watch it again to understand it fully, but wow, not only does it dazzle your eyes, but your mind as well. The atmosphere is dark and depressing it's there to get you in the mood so the movie will deliver you to a place in your mind. Very creative<br/><br/>It's more of a message than a story. And it's done incredibly well.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER START******s -----------------------s -----------------------s s<br/><br/>at first, I thought sucker punch would be some action movie where this girl kicks asses of some place she's locked up. But it wasn't even that, it'll give you a little introduction about how the stepfather is happy because their mother is dead, she's obviously loaded with cash, although because of legal issues in her will (giving all her possessions to her two daughters) he gets angry and wants to take out the two girls. The little sister die, and he sends her on a mental institution. At first I just expect it to be like any other piece of crap American movie where the head of this mental institution is going to help her, she gets out, everyone lives happily ever after, gets married and dies old... but it isn't. The head ""uses"" the patients. It jumps in time to where she's getting something through her eye.<br/><br/>Since it's back in time where psychology was just a new thing and the craft not very well developed this was designed to stun her or something. However before she gets ""stabbed in her eye"" it suddenly jumps into an alternative world where the mental institution becomes a whore house, it's another way to see reality. So the viewer doesn't really know WHAT was going on, it's all a metaphor, a very symbolic movie so to speak. And when they perform their little operations it's a symbol for how their operation is. If anyone ever saw inception, this is a level 2 dream. The first alternative reality is the whore house, this is not really happening, and you don't know how the other girls die. You don't even know their personality, you won't hear what babydoll is actually saying. * * s * *s<br/><br/>*s s<br/><br/>* s s s s **********SPOILER END*************<br/><br/>I would basically recommend this to people who likes dragons, awesome fight scenes, guys mainly (because of the chicks.)

","Coming from the director of 300 and Watchmen if you expect anything less of action and CG from Sucker Punch, you are dead wrong! You will be instantly blown away by the visual effects and the sheer amount of mind blowing action throughout this flick.<br/><br/>The plot is not complicated yet when you watch it you will definitely be lost here and there. The story is about a girl (AKA Baby Doll) who is abused by her stepfather and then condemned in to a mental asylum. While she plots to escape from the horrible place she gets the help from few other girls. With her buddies and borderless vivid imagination she set up a plan to get away and set to execute it step by step.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is all about visual fantasy than being a hard hit story line. Sexy set of girls wearing tight pants and skinnies shooting and kicking the butts of weird creatures and robots and Hitler's mechanic army doesn't sound realistic at all. But when the movie rolls out each of these scenarios becomes practically extravagant with minute and breathtaking detail. Some of the action sequences like the attacking of robots in disarming the nuclear bomb (AKA kitchen Knife) are totally amazing. The work done for CG, live action and set creation is maybe one of the best which I have seeing in recent movie making.<br/><br/>Thought The plot is weak it's not entirely bad. From one angle it's a psychological thriller. From another it's a fantasy. Put them together it's a thrilling movie about an escape plan made uniquely than any other. And the fantastic sound track consists of heavy metal and soft rock music just purely adds up to the thrill. And the first 5 mts of the movie is purely a ground breaking start with a touch of a music video. Fantastic!<br/><br/>More at flickshout.tk"

","Can I just start by saying that the trailer for this film blew me away; but despite what was a beautiful piece of marketing by WB, I kinda knew from the get go that the film-itself would never really bring anything new to the table - my question is: does that matter?<br/><br/>Sure the film was well cast, the set design was flawless, cinematography (as always) a liiiitle over processed for my liking but hey; Snyder has a thing going. My biggest problem with the film was with the character development.<br/><br/>***Spoilers*** sort of?<br/><br/>For those who don't know the film is about a girl ""Baby Doll"" (Emily Browning) who after accidentally killing her little sister in the opening credits is sent to an insane asylum where one of the head doctors/guards/warder or whatever (it's never really that clear) ""Blue Jones"" (Oscar Issac) is bribed to get her lobotomised. Thats pretty much as deep as the story gets for the first 80 mins of the film.<br/><br/>While WB Studios were really selling this as a female empowerment flick on the basis that the girls are kicking butt; it really isn't. These scantily clad females are emotionally beat down for pretty much the whole film and even when they are kicking ass, its only in Baby Doll's imagination, and its only for spectacle. This film is essentially sexploitation, but thats not necessarily a bad thing.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I loved watching the film. It was everything I was expecting: Firey, action packed, full of babes clad in a seemingly endless variety of cosplay, but when it came to a film that sells itself on a group of 5 protagonists, they're all pretty much interchangeable and background wise it is extraordinarily hard to tell them apart (Except for maybe the fact that two of the girls are sisters).<br/><br/>One thing that I loved about the film is the unique way that the story is told in a semi metaphoric way through the eyes of the possibly legitimately insane main characters to really hammer home the ""All men are pigs theme"" by transforming the asylum into a burlesque house. While I liked this interesting angle I felt as though too much is left unexplained as to what is happening in the real world while this fantasy world is in place. SPOILERS The last we see of the asylum, until the last 15 mins of the film, is Baby Doll strapped to a chair about to be lobotomised.<br/><br/>The film seems to be structured around a series of fantastical sub states of subconsciousness (Inception?) and while they are stunning to watch they are a pretty flimsy excuse for a storyline considering that the film leans pretty hard on them.<br/><br/>Soundtrack for this film was amazing and gets a big thumbs up from me. I absolutely loved it. 'nuff said.<br/><br/>In closing: although Sucker Punch has nothing new to offer, it is a pretty seamless film and a smooth semi-believable storyline. It's really more of an art piece than a narrative and once you accept that as an audience member you can just sit back and enjoy the audio-visual adrenaline.<br/><br/>A nice warm 7/10 from me. Good on you Zacky Baby."

","Saw Sucker Punch at the midnight Premier in Imax. And I have to say movie was great. Not like how I said Green Hornet or IronMan two was great. This was on a different lvl. While I am the main targeted demographic and while it did appeal to that side of me that loves guns, girls, and rocknroll. This movie hit on a different lvl. Almost like inception. The 1st 30min of the movie no one talked. *This was a full theater at Universal Studios mind you* The movie just suckes you into to this confusing, beautiful, strange yet familiar world that your left speech less but with your mind racing trying to figure out whats going on. But in a good way lol.<br/><br/>The girls aren't over the top. Like Megan fox in transformers mainly their to look at. They are actual characters.<br/><br/>The fighting/Action is of course over the top amazing and Id expect nothing less from the man that brought us 300 and Watchmen. Every genera of action movie was hit here. From Fantasy to WWI Its Visually stunning and it has so many locations that nothing gets stale. And its not just the action scenes even the more normal parts of the movie look great.<br/><br/>The sound track was spectacular. I just bought the soundtrack today lol. The movie has a musical theme to it and it really works. The choice of music is great. And the sound effects top notch. No CallofDuty guns sounds here.<br/><br/>The acting isn't Oscar worthy no should it be. If your looking for that kinda movie go watch The Kings Speech.<br/><br/>The only thing I can think of that may break it for you is the story. While I loved it others I know felt it was confusing or didn't like the ending. Bare in mind these friends of mine are the same ones who didn't like inception or Buried. So make sure you go in with an open mind.<br/><br/>You want a mind bending action film watch this. You want your normal Hollywood film with predictable scenes and a happy ending you say coming from the 1st 5minuets go watch something else."

","""You have all the weapons you need. Now fight!""<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is a cheesecake action movie that offers a crazy premise, lots of hot girls, and non-stop video game/anime inspired explosions and fights. If you expect anything more than that from the movie, you will be greatly disappointed. This is a niche film if I've ever seen one. It's simultaneously silly, dark, and very grim. All sex appeal and slow-motion back flips. Style over substance taken to a new peak. And a lot of people will most assuredly hate it.   <br/><br/>Will this appeal to you? Picture watching a hot girl having a sword fight with giant Gatling gun-wielding demon samurai (in slow motion and with lots of explosions and collapsing buildings) one minute, and then watching five hot girls fight a WWI-inspired battle against Nazi Zombies the next minute. With giant mechs. And then there are dragons. And orcs. And nothing but the flimsiest excuse for why these things are happening. And each girl dresses like a burlesque dancer or call girl at all times. And there's non-stop violence involving said scantily-clad girls. Sucker Punch is two hours of exactly all those things.<br/><br/>Oh, and there are three separate realities that the characters exist in. <br/><br/>I won't even bother trying to explain the story, because it's just an insane excuse to see half-naked women do things and kill stuff in slow motion. Don't worry about the plot, it will just distract you from focusing on Baby Doll (Emily Browning) shooting down a Zeppelin with a machine gun, while wearing a sailor outfit/Japanese school girl uniform. Or keep you from focusing on Rocket (Jena Malone) while she's blowing off a robot's head with a sawed-off shotgun and trying to stop a bomb on a speeding train from blowing up a city. If you're going to watch this movie, you'll get the best experience by keeping your attention solely on what's happening right in front of you at any given moment, and forgetting about what's happened before or what the overall story is supposed to be, and how any of this is supposed to fit into it. Just go with it.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is nonsensical, silly, and lots of people who see it will think it's purely exploitative, empty, action-driven trash. That's a fair assessment. I can't fault them for that opinion. Even a fan of the movie (which I am, in case you can't tell by now) has to admit that at it's very best, Sucker Punch is an absurd, sleazy male fantasy with only the most shallow visual appeal and thrills to recommend it. <br/><br/>I still found it very entertaining, though. Flaws and all, this was ultimately a fun movie (for me). For the right audience, Sucker Punch is a uniquely exhilarating genre flick that combines babes, action, and a ton of different influences in a way that doesn't happen very often. <br/><br/>Just consider my review carefully before you watch something that could possibly be a massive waste of your time. As for me, I'm looking forward to a blu-ray release that hopefully restores the footage that was cut from the theatrical version. This is a crazy ride, but I'm totally prepared to take it again."
"janmikal","7","3","5","26 March 2011"," Spoiler Alerts! Not sure how I felt...
","This review contains spoilers. Be warned.<br/><br/>Dictonary.com says - Sucker Punch: to strike (someone) with an unexpected blow<br/><br/>Yeah, I get it. This movie definitely catches you unaware. it starts a little confusing, in a slickly edited series of scenes that, at first, get you scratching your head and wondering 'what the hell'? At first, I thought the stepfather was the dead mother's attorney until it was explicitly stated who he was. But you move into the groove pretty quickly. Babydoll is unjustly tried, convicted and sentenced, and from there, it just...goes. Like a cheetah with a JATO pack strapped to its ass. It's very stylized, very comic-bookish without ever really becoming cartoon-y. The first fight with Babydoll and the giant Samurai is....yes, I'll say it. Awesome. The triple-layer is a little hard to catch up with if you're not paying attention; admittedly, for a bit I was wondering if both the Institution AND the bordello were reality, that the 'insane' girls were forced to work in the bordello to make Blue his money. Then I realized that it was the 'first' layer, and the fights were the 'second' layer. My only real problem with the film is that the characters weren't introduced well in the beginning, so couldn't be realized later one. The 'Mayor', from who they got the fire...okay, the only hint who he was, was the passing cut-scene where you see a guy flicking open and closed a Zippo lighter. Those who aren't quite paying attention just won't get it, and are left wondering 'Who the hell is this Mayor' guy. Same went with the High Roller/Doctor. The only reason I got they were the same person was the time-frame. Blue says 'The lobotomist will be here in five days', and then in the First Layer mentions that the High Roller will be here in the same period. So, some of the characters that weren't very realized could have been better, but...such is life.<br/><br/>The 'main' characters aren't very well realized either. We know /all/ about Babydoll's existence, why she's there and what she's about, but the others, we know nothing. I would have liked to know, or at least have an idea what Blondie and Amber did to get there. It's a fairly safe bet to assume that none of them are /really/ insane... I think it's pretty clear that this place is where girls who were 'trouble' were sent. And, in the later movie, we watch as Blue kills Amber and Blondie in the First Layer bordello...I would LOVED to have known what happened to them. Did they actually die? Or were they 'taken out' some other way (locked in solitary, also lobotomized, etc). We know that Rocket dies - we see her get stabbed by the cook and die in the Real Life layer. Maybe I am just looking too deep for explanations.<br/><br/>I also wonder if there is some meaning to the girls' roles in the Fight-Layer. Amber is always the pilot, of the Walker-Mech, the bomber and the helicopter. Babydoll, Rocket and Sweet Pea are always the on-the-ground fighters, with guns and steel. Blondie just seems to float; in one scene she's a ground-fighter, in the next she's the plane's tail-gunner, and then she's gone. I wasn't especially fond of her ratting out the others, either. The story was interesting, but it could have been so much better. Okay, now on to the good stuff.<br/><br/>The visuals. Amazing. Stunning. Beyond compare. The fight scenes are dramatic and fast-paced and simply jaw-dropping. Yes, the woman are 'scantily clad', but they're never in lingerie, keeping to short skirts and a bit of cleavage, so no one could /really/ say they're 'exploited'. But there is skin to be admired, so open wide. Your eyes, that is. Yes, there is a lot of slow-mo, which apparently Zack is known for, but I say this; with the visuals in the movie, if there /weren't/ a lot of slow-mo, you'd miss EVERYthing. Be grateful for the slow-action shots, because they are worth it. <br/><br/>All in all? Well - Story Idea/Plot: 8/10 Story Execution: 5/10 Visuals: 9.5/10 Acting: 7/10 Character Development: 5/10<br/><br/>Worth it? Yes. Just don't expect it to win any Oscars that aren't Effects-related."

Her cuteness dragged me through, not her growth as a character.<br/><br/>3 actors carried the whole movie, 1 of which was not that important to the flow of the story, and none of which was the hero of the story, the others tried to get by on seductive faces, over the top make-up, and sexy lingerie.<br/><br/>Had a hard time swallowing the character development, was not sure if the character had truly grown by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were fluffy with lights slow-motion and bullet-time, but never went beyond 2 movements before an attack. Very little Science to the choreographing.<br/><br/>You can totally tell that they piggy-backed off of 5-6 video games and anime to gather their ideas for the action scenes. (Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, Dragon Age, Call of Duty, Final Fantasy, Sailor Moon)."

","To be honest it is hard to truly judge the movie. There are several aspects of the film that perform well such as several music choices, action sequences, and the (for the most part) attractiveness of the females within the movie. The biggest problem of Sucker Punch is that it won't go all the way in several scenarios. At times when you think the sex appeal will be exploited, it isn't. That is fine BUT instead of going all the way with heavy drama, the movie instead lets the viewer sort out what is presented. This in a way comes off as trying to get the viewer to think of several scenarios i.e. Inception, but the lack of a fleshed out story makes one battle over certain moments *SPOILER* (KIND OF) (like the beginning, who is evil is explained late, why he is evil is not explained, why he even did what he did prior to Babydoll's entrance to the mental facility is in many ways unnecessary).<br/><br/>All in all this isn't a horrible film. Many Snyder moments are here and the cast does well at the action sequences. I feel the whole ""mind setting one free"" is a bit overused at the moment. Additionally, since it has been done much better in other films, Sucker Punch takes a hit.<br/><br/>It is hard to judge the movie because many will go in wanting to like it, even providing excuses for the films flaws. But there are so many, and with an incredibly weak story, the action sequences would have been better off had they been joined like the Animatrix film (common theme or world but different stories with different emphasized elements). I thoroughly enjoyed all of the references to nerd culture, but their lack of proper/enjoyable integration makes one loathe the ""story"" moments in between the action.<br/><br/>When you watch this film, turn off your brain and enjoy sword fights and shooting. It has been put down on my list of guilty pleasures because I enjoyed several moments, but it's hard to sell it to anyone who has the expectation of being blown away."

The idea is simple, take everything a guy would like(sexy chicks, hot uniforms, dragons, guns, robots, mechanic samurai etc), add the 3 elements listed above, throw all of it in to a movie blender and ""bam!"" comes Sucker Punch.<br/><br/>Plot is out of the window due to the strong surrealism, since anything goes and whatever that's out of place or doesn't make sense can can be explained.<br/><br/>Visuals is awesome just like any other Zack Snyder film, and the music complimented the overall atmosphere nicely.<br/><br/>Fight and action sequence is a bit predictable and dull at moments, but still worth a look. One reason for the dullness to me is because the girls wasn't delivering enough bad-ass-ness(but are still hot). The added touch of the ultra-tough body physics which you see in anime or manga was quite interesting and different.<br/><br/>Despite the cliché dialog and redundant guns and katana fight scene that you see ever so often these days, Sucker Punch is still quite joyful to watch, because of all the things guys can't resist liking.

","At the Pitch Meeting, somewhere in LA, Zack Snyder and a Studio Boss...<br/><br/>SB: Hey, Zack, man, I loved your Watchmen and 300 movies. Whatchya got for us today, dude?<br/><br/>ZS: Well... Charlie's Angels had 3 hot babes. I think there should have been 5. And the Matrix had 2 alternate universes, there really should have been 3. More is better, right?<br/><br/>SB: I can dig that.<br/><br/>ZS: And I liked that Tarantino multiple movies in a single movie thing that he did with Grind House, recently.<br/><br/>SB: Yeah, but that was too high concept. We had to chop them back into separate movies.<br/><br/>ZS: That's because Quentin made them too separate. What you need is to mix them up in the same movie, and keep the running time under 2 hours.<br/><br/>SB: So, what are these separate pieces then, Zack, mi amigo?<br/><br/>ZS: Well, I don't want to over-simplify, but one reality is kinda like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. But with hot, semi-naked chicks, instead of Jack Nicholson and an overgrown Indian.<br/><br/>SB: OFOTCN was a great movie... but I always thought something was missing. And what else?<br/><br/>ZS: I think a bit of Moulin Rouge... but with a psycho pimp and some Kung Fu.<br/><br/>SB: Man, you are one crazy dude, I always thought there should have been more Kung Fu in Moulin Rouge!<br/><br/>ZS: And then a bit of Kill Bill.<br/><br/>SB: But Bill's dead.<br/><br/>ZS: Yeah, I know... but I found someone who looks just like him! Isn't that cool? And then I added some giant robot samurai!<br/><br/>SB: Whoa, most excellent, dude! The kids are crying out for giant robot samurai! Are you throwing anything else in here, or are you done already?<br/><br/>ZS: Well, those are just the main realities. But we have some adventure worlds, too. I got some stuff happenin' on a high-tech train with a bomb and weaponized androids. And a world war I adventure which is kinda like Inglourious Basterds, but with hot, semi-naked chicks in my kill squad, instead of a bunch of Jewish dudes. With German soldiers as zombies driven by clockwork and steam. And then a bit of fantasy-style Lord of the Rings with Orcs and Dragons, but with hot, semi-naked chicks on a quest, instead of those ugly little Hobbit dudes.<br/><br/>SB: Man, you are really pushing the envelope here, Zack! It sounds wild and exciting, with, like, remakes of every cool movie of the last 20 years! Um... not to be churlish, but does it have a story too?<br/><br/>ZS: Of course. There's a hot, semi-naked chick, framed for a murder she didn't commit by her evil stepfather. And then she bonds with her fellow inmates, and teaches them self-reliance and stuff. Although it's not very useful, 'cos she gets most of them killed. Except one. Who finds freedom with Bill. And there's some quests, not for a ring, but for a map, fire, knife, key... which sorta help get them out of wherever they are. And some really bad dudes. And lobotomies. And did I mention the hot, semi-naked chicks? I'm going for boots, thigh-highs, little skirts, and plenty o' cleavage.<br/><br/>SB: Zach, you crazy sob! Let's do it! I got $75m to make it! Is that enough to include a ton of CGI and the hyper-real look you did with 300? And a really loud rock / pop / rap soundtrack?<br/><br/>ZS: Absolutely, man. Oh... and make it $82m, and I'll get Don from Mad Men to add some class.<br/><br/>SB: This is so crazy, it might just work!<br/><br/>GJ: And it did. Don't ask me to explain why, but it was kinda fun. I guess the hot, semi-naked chicks helped it along. Just don't over-analyze it, or expect anything highbrow. I feel bad admitting it, but I liked it."

The movie is dark, music is good, plot is excellent, three CGIs set-ups are from games - fantasy, WWI and scifi. It's a kind of mix of everything. But the major plot is brilliant, and the ending is great. You don't need to concentrate on CGI scenes or their quality. Zack Snyder could equally insert anime or just pictures instead with the same effect, it doesn't really matter. The movies is not about manga girls acting in games. When you watch all this darkness of the clinics recreated by Zack Snyder, and the final medical verdict made, and you know a bit history of American psychiatry, you start thinking more about dark American past and where all these evil people came from. Surely, not from dreams of the poor girl."

"Rectangular_businessman","2","4","8","30 May 2012"," Tries to be everything at the same time
","Some people wonder why this movie flopped.<br/><br/>My question is: How this movie could not be a flop when, after so much time of Internet hype, with several viewers expecting this to be the ultimate fantasy-action film (With zombies, dragons, and giant samurai monsters) it ended being an ugly and depressive drama where all the fantasy elements showed by all the previews and trailers were just hallucinations that have zero relevance to the actual plot of the movie. Too bad that this movie lacks of the same emotional impact and originality of films where the main characters were divided between reality and fantasy, such as ""Brazil"" or ""Pan's Labyrinth"".<br/><br/>The main problem of ""Sucker Punch"" is that it tries to be everything (And I mean, absolutely everything) at the same time, and doing that, it manages to be incredibly disappointing at every single level. It tries to be an exciting summer blockbuster that at the same time it's a depressive and dark art-house drama, which is also a ""complex"" psychological thriller (By adding the completely unnecessary brothel subplot, in order to achieve some forced comparisons between this and ""Inception"") Unfortunately, the combination of all those elements and themes results into something very frustrating and muddled, being that the main reason of why this movie got so poor reviews: In the attempt to please every audience, it managed to disappoint most of the viewers. It's not something like ""The public just doesn't get this film""; I mean, I get this film, but I still don't like it, mostly because the subplot of the movie that takes place in the real world (The one that actually matters) it's quite shallow and frustrating, with the characters doing several idiotic decisions in order to shoehorn the ""tragic"" elements of the story to make it more depressive But since that is not enough for this movie (And considering the fact that it desperately tries to be everything at the same time) it also wants to have an ""uplifting"" note at the end, by making one secondary character achieve a somewhat happy ending. That wouldn't be too bad if it wasn't for the fact that the character in question is somebody quite uninteresting and with zero personality at all that most of the time just does a filler role. As a viewer, I am supposed to feel happy with the incredibly frustrating ending just because some boring secondary character that never does something remotely important in the whole story gets a happy ending? Honestly, with all those frustrating characteristics, this was doomed to fail from the beginning.<br/><br/>""Sucker Punch"" is just a self-indulgent mess which could have been (at least) something interesting, but instead of that it comes as a big failure guaranteed to disappoint everyone."
"tedcunn","1","4","8","9 August 2011"," So many great elements lumped together in an awful film
","I hardly ever write reviews on here, because I almost never read them. I'm not sure why the opinion of some faceless nobody I know nothing about should have any sway in my choice of films. This, however, has moved to write something about it.<br/><br/>I missed seeing this film at the cinema for various reasons and deeply regretted it. In its favour, it looks amazing, the cast is great and there's so much style in the directing it's incredible.<br/><br/>It is, however, in my opinion, the worst film I have ever seen. And I've sat through Troll 2, Manos: The Hands of Fate and many other notorious films.<br/><br/>This film has three sections:<br/><br/>1. The mental asylum. This hardly features in the film at all. Which is a shame, because what we see of it looks interesting.<br/><br/>2. A nightclub/brothel. The nearest the film gets to being interesting, but because it's so poorly set up and used it just gets dull and tedious.<br/><br/>3. Large scale action sequences. They look great. The trouble is they are pointless and feel more like padding than anything else. It's like somebody had a bunch of great ideas for fight scenes and chucked them in at random. Pretty much anything can happen in these sequences, which is fun at first, but then becomes tedious as you realise any massive obstacle can be overcome.<br/><br/>And the ending? The air is still echoing with the swearing the ending produced. All it did was confirm what seemed obvious all along (the nightclub/brothel being an invention of the main character that replaced the asylum in her mind - meaning, it made even less sense and we spent have the film watching fantasies with in a fantasy.)<br/><br/>It also meant that no genuine problems were dealt with. Minor characters supposedly killed by armed guards in the nightclub/brothel should still be alive. And, worst of all, the attack on the main character that starts the film has no pay-off or resolution. The character that does best out of this film is the abusive stepfather.<br/><br/>I like films that are a bit different. I also need some substance, characters to care about and a central plot that's involving - or at least makes enough sense to care about. This film had none of those elements. I'm sure some stills from it would look great on my wall, but that's not enough for a movie."
"Quebec_Dragon","5","4","8","10 April 2011"," Almost felt suckered... would you?
","There were lots of punches. There was a sucker (lollipop). I wasn't sucker punched by surprise but I almost felt suckered for paying full price at the theatre. Let's start by saying that I loved all of Zack Snyder's previous films but this one left me perplexed. The story has 3 layers of ""reality"": 1) Our heroine is placed unjustly in a mental institution 2) She's stuck in a cabaret club/whorehouse 3) She's a super-powered fighter in a wild mix of settings involving giant samurais, steam-powered Nazi zombies, dragons and robots amongst others. Yes, it's a bit like an unholy mash-up of different films: Inception/Brazil/One Flew Over the Cuckoo' Nest/Moulin Rouge/Kill Bill in certain ways but less complex and particularly less emotionally involving. Our main heroine flees her unbearable situation through imagination, a theme I certainly love in movies, but I certainly wish the ""visions"" had been less superficial.<br/><br/>Weirdly, I found the first ""reality"" (asylum) the most gripping (especially the intro) but it's the one where we spend the least time. For me, it seemed that the deeper and more spectacular the setting was, the least I was involved. Those settings in the third layer were mostly action-oriented, extremely simplistic (like missions in a bad video game) yet visually spectacular. They were like a crazy mix of pulp/genre archetypes that are not usually combined. To be honest, it was like nothing I had ever seen before. Those action scenes/special effects were expertly done, but somehow left me cold and uninvolved the longer they ran. It's as if I didn't care. They felt ""hollow"".<br/><br/>This brings me to perhaps the biggest problem of the film. The characters are not developed or characterized enough making vicarious identification difficult if not impossible. The sense of danger or the losses were not really felt, at least for me. I liked Rocket well enough (probably because of the actress' performance) but 2 of the female characters (Blondie and Amber) were cardboard-thin and the others weren't that great. At first glance, the story itself seems complex but is in fact rather simple (not bad in itself). It's just not particularly well told. I saw the ""sucker punches"" coming a mile away, either that or I didn't really care one way or the other.<br/><br/>The main villain lacked a certain something to make him truly special or threatening, which is a shame because this movie begged for a villain we could truly love to hate. The sensei, who could have been played by David Carradine, was the only likable man in this pic but his involvement was limited mostly to story exposition. I didn't care much for the washed-out color schemes in the different layers but it's a defensible stylistic choice. The cinematography itself is quite stylish as usual for Zack Snyder. You certainly recognize the director's signature touches although he overindulges in some of his favorites moves (witness: when the girls land on the ground).<br/><br/>For 2 different recurring elements, he intentionally hides what's happening (the dance and later the face) and I found that rather clever and mysterious in a good way. The soundtrack consists mostly of known pop/alternative songs, either cover or original, and they fit tremendously well giving a real ""punch"" to the scenes. However, a little more than halfway through, the choices seemed less inspired, not bad per say but not great as before.<br/><br/>Should you watch Sucker Punch? Probably not at full price in the theatre but just for the amazing visuals later on, yes. Especially if you're a fan of the director's previous works. The story and characters will likely disappoint though.<br/><br/>Rating: 5.5 out of 10 (average-good)"
"Hellmant","9","4","8","27 March 2011"," 'SUCKER PUNCH' is a great punch to the senses, nothing more!
","'SUCKER PUNCH': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Zack Snyder (the director of 'WATCHMEN', '300', the 2004 'DAWN OF THE DEAD' remake and last year's 'LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS: THE OWLS OF GA'HOOLE') brings us another visually vibrant action packed fantasy thrill ride. This one he co-wrote with Steve Shibuya and it's his first film not based on other material. While the film is as visually satisfying and enthralling as any of his previous works it lacks the story and character development that made those other films truly great. The film features a gorgeous ensemble cast of tough twenty something girls as the action heroine leads (including Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung) and delivers everything else a teen boy could possibly want to see on screen (as well as many older men) despite it's lack of emotional involvement. In this area it's quite stunning and impressive though.<br/><br/>Browning stars as Baby Doll, a twenty year old young woman who's institutionalized in a 1950's insane asylum by her stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) after trying to stop him from molesting her sister. The stepfather bribes the main orderly in charge, Blue (Oscar Isaac), into arranging an illegal lobotomy for the girl. With just five days until this impending doom Baby Doll befriends four other girls and devises a plan of escape. In order to help her process this nightmarish situation she's found herself in she creates two alternate realities. In the first fantasy she's a new dancer at a brothel owned by the mob and is set to lose her virginity to an important client in five days. She then escapes into another fantasy world in which she's a Japanese school girl warrior and must battle giant Tengu samurais, orcs, robots and dragons in order to retrieve five items which will lead to her freedom. In this world she's guided by a wise old man (Scott Glenn).<br/><br/>The movie is titled 'Angel Wars' in Japan and has been described as ""'Alice In Wonderland' with machine guns."" I like the sound of that but I think it's giving the film just a little too much credit. I admire the overall story and mood of the film and what it attempts to do but I think it could have been greatly improved by a tighter rewrite. The directing is once again topnotch and continues to prove that Snyder is one of the best fantasy / action directors working in film today. Like George Lucas, James Cameron, Bryan Singer and other comparable directors his eye for creative visuals and thrilling action is much more impressive than his emotional depth and character development. Here, working with material all his own for the first time, we see that's definitely the case. We know little about any of the characters in the story really and the fantasy scenes are so emotionally detached from the rest of the film, due to our understanding that none of it is in fact real, that they lose some of their thrill and awe as well. Still the movie is extremely entertaining and so full of enjoyable eye candy that it's hard to complain about any of the film's flaws too much really. It delivers what fan boys want and is an incredibly fun time at the movies despite it's short comings. It could have been better though.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIAZ2104LOU"

","****MAY HAVE SOME SPOILERS*****<br/><br/>I've managed to go to the Avant Premiere on the 21st. As I've read a lot of the film, I knew where the thing was going to.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, there are a lot of things that are not quite clear, messy, and also a lot of facts Zack has to improve on as a director. Its a very complex story what he had in mind, and not a easy work to do. A movie has a structure, you can twist it, make it insane, but making sense at the same time. In some ways, it didn't.<br/><br/>I can't be objective with the message of the movie right know, it keeps saying and showing that ""you"" are the key to all the problems you have. Its very simple itself, but heavy at the same time. The fact that you were expecting something shallow, when it gets to the strong part of the story, it hits you. It really got me, it made me feel something. And that's important in a movie, not to be shallow.<br/><br/>The art department is incredible (both sound and visual), despite of being a mix of past movies (excalibur, lord of the rings, etc.). Anyway there're a lot of original designs. I do admire the capacity of showing that amount of content in such a little time frame and also leaving you a message.<br/><br/>The imagination scenes, inside the burlesque (that's also her imagination), are not quite necessary. It makes the movie ""cooler"" but makes it very complicated with no reason to be. The spectator receives so many different informations that ends up not feeling ""sucker-punched"" by the imagination scenes Babydoll creates while dancing. Specially if the you don't know what the movie is about before going to watch it. Take those scenes away, and the movie would had been visually amazing and had made sense anyway. I would have done the burlesque fantasy and leave it there, it was a perfect idea the one he had about her turning the asylum as a cabaret. Insanity is acceptable inside an asylum. But insanity inside insanity is too messy to play around.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch sold us an action movie, that would left us with our mouth opened, meaning "" visually"". That was the concept of the title almost everyone had. But when you get to see the movie you find something you were not ""prepared"" to watch, something you didn't expect. The action or the supposed visually amazing scenes really didn't got me. Because the important fact was not the mechas, zombies, war, droids or samurais. It IS Babydoll's story, problems, and how she decides to scape or solve them. And it may also be because of the amount of things going around at the same time or it was made that way on purpose, so the spectator does focus more on the character reality.<br/><br/>For example, the climax and the end of the movie, are the best parts. And those being the ones that don't have the ""imagination"" sequences on them, still on the burlesque but happening the same as in the asylum, that's why I say he should've left the movie THERE, on the cabaret, and go no further. This tells you something about the strength of the story leaving behind those sequences.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch it's not an ""ACTION"" movie itself, fantasy or epic. I'd call it a drama covered up with color-lights.<br/><br/>Despite of these negative comments, I enjoyed it. I found it original and rare. I've been following its steps for a long time, and kind of got attached to it. They've fail in many things, but worked well on others. -I'm sick of hearing that it's the same as INCEPTION , first, because it's not a dream inside a dream to change your ideals, it's a girl's way to scape from reality, and second, because this story was thought about 7/8 years ago by Zack and from then on with Steve they started working on it to get it real.- Some will get disappointed for not being able to watch what they thought they would see. What Sucker Punch sold us with all those amazing trailers, visually eye-popping posters and etcetera. Some others, like me, will feel the ""sucker punch"", despite of the visual facts. It's not a movie for everyone."
"officefan01","1","6","14","20 August 2013"," Awful...Just Awful
","My sister and I were talking about the Man of Steel trailer and I said that Zack Snyder probably wasn't the best choice to direct Man of Steel. I gave Sucker Punch being a disappointment for critics and audiences. My sister said it was great. Then again, she likes Green Lantern, Indiana Jones 4 and the Star Wars prequels. So, she lent it to me to watch and I was shocked. Here's why:<br/><br/>1. The Plot: It's another bland prison escape movie, just with hot chicks who fight dragons, samurai and zombies for no real reason except that Zack Snyder thought it would be awesome. The problem is, is that the fights with the dragon, samurai, zombies and other things make no sense whatsoever. For example, if they needed an item with a dragon on it, they could've fought the dragon. In a movie that's suppose to be symbolic, that kind of seems like a good idea that the director forgot about. Don't say that I don't get it, because I understood everything about this movie. <br/><br/>2. The Heroes: The heroes are incredibly boring. They show no emotion whatsoever. They don't even seem like they want to be there. By that I mean, the actors don't want to be on set. They don't even bother to ask each other about each other. They could ask each other what their real names are and try to identify themselves outside of this prison, but since when does Zach Snyder care about character development? Also, why not have some of these girls die off in these earlier action sequences? I mean it's a fantasy after all, so they wouldn't actually die, but that would help them make them stronger in the next sequence. But since no one dies, it's just incredibly boring. Also, since all Babydoll has to do to get in these fantasy worlds is dance, why not show the dance? Well, because Zach Snyder says that he didn't want to show her dancing because it was a female empowerment story. So, it was sexist to show her dancing, but it wasn't sexist to show all of the girl's panties while they were fighting? I'll get back to that point later.<br/><br/>3. Everyone Else: The main villain is this clichéd villain, who just hates these characters for no real reason other than being a sexist a-hole. Also, he is overacting in every scene he's in. The heroes are under acting and the villains are over acting, and it just comes off as just plain awful. Carla Gugino provides nothing in this movie whatsoever. Also, Babydoll's step dad is an idiot. So he doesn't get money from his wife so in order to get it, he starts raping Babydoll's sister? Why doesn't he just kill them, make it look like an accident and just collect the money? Oh yeah, because all men are idiots and jerks apparently. I'll get back to this point later as well. <br/><br/>4. The Visuals, Cinematography and Music The visuals, which probably drove most people to see it, are not that impressive. I've seen better special effects in TV shows. The cinematography is probably the only good thing in this movie, but it's not that good, it's only okay. The music, I hate the music. All of the music is just cover songs that don't really sound that good. I prefer the original songs. What's wrong with the original songs? Maybe it's copyright reasons, who knows? More importantly, who cares? Apparently I do since I'm writing this review.<br/><br/>5. Sexism at its finest This movie manages to be offensive to men and women. It's offensive to men, because it treats every male character like a jerk and an idiot. Not all men are jerks and idiots. Worst of all, they treat women so poorly. They don't give these girls that much of an identity, they're boring, I couldn't care about them. The worst part of that is, is that these girls are tired are being treated as sex objects and are trying to break out of this prison, but they constantly fight all of these random things in slow motion (which there's too much of), half-naked. How is that empowering to women? I don't approve of sexism of any kind, but this movie just doesn't get it.<br/><br/>Overall, this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's boring, pretentious, clichéd, predictable and hypocritical movies I've ever seen. The actors are either under acting or over acting. The visuals are not that impressive. They manage to offend men, because it treats them like jerks and a-holes. They manage to offend women, because they sexualize them when they don't want to be sexualized by these clients and are not really all that empowering. It's like watching someone play a video game, they're doing all the action and you're just sitting bored out of your mind. <br/><br/>The worst part of this whole experience is not the acting, the accidental sexism, but that my sister yelled at me because I didn't like it. I showed her a list of the most disappointing movies a long time ago and this was placed at number 7. She explained this by saying that people don't understand good filmmaking. This? Good filmmaking? If people don't understand it's good filmmaking, then explain why critics and audiences love movies like The Godfather, Inception, Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption and The Lord of the Rings to name a few, and why people hate movies like recent spoof movies, Transformers, Twilight, The Last Airbender and others? Calling this good filmmaking is like calling Jersey Shore quality television. I understand it's her opinion and she's a feminist and all. But, she should be offended by the characters and how they're not all that empowering, but I can see where she's coming from. Where I'm coming from, this movie is awful. It manages offend men, women and possibly everyone's intelligence."

","Sucker Punch fails so spectacularly in so many ways it's actually kind of interesting. How could an acclaimed, visually accomplished director making the ultimate geek fantasy with tens of millions of dollars end up creating something this rubbish? <br/><br/>First, the characters, or lack thereof. The girls simply have no personality and differ from each other in no other ways than height and cup size. They hardly show any emotion and there's nothing to show what kind of people they are. The same applies to all the other characters with the possible exception of the villain, but only because someone has to be the bad guy. The acting is as good as the characters, i.e. terrible, but you're so detached from the movie anyway it hardly matters.<br/><br/>Second, the visuals. One would assume on the basis of the trailer that the movie would at least evoke visual interest, but fails even at that. It's simply too much: once you've seen one amazing scenario you kind of zone out and it all becomes white noise. Zack Snyder's love for slo-mo is at its very worst here: the movie feels like it's been directed by a 12-year old who can't sit still for 5 seconds without going ""PHWOOOOAARR ISN'T THAT COOL?!"" And since all the visuals are done with CGI, none of the action sequences have any physicality or tension to them. It's about as exciting as watching marshmallows getting dropped on a silk mattress in 0,1 gravity.<br/><br/>Third, the soundtrack. All I can remember is a cacophony of electric guitars and techno beats. In conjunction with the visuals it becomes simply too overwhelming, going in one ear and coming out the other.<br/><br/>These are only the main problems of the film, but the way they combine and create new problems is quite amazing. The end result is one of the stupidest, most juvenile and boring films released this century.<br/><br/>Recommendation: I can't recommend this film to anyone. Not even movie masochists, because unlike other atrocious sludge like Sex and the City 2, SPunch isn't even painful to watch, it's simply boring. Boring beyond words."

","I am not a graphic novel reader, so can't compare this film too the novels, but I am an avid film watcher & having seen Snyder's other films, 300, Watchmen & Dawn Of The Dead, went into this film with reasonable expectations. Confident that I would be entertained by a CGI driven action fantasy with (I hoped) a half decent plot! Sadly Sucker Punch doesn't deliver on any level, the plot is too long winded & flimsy, the CGI nothing overtly original & the acting is way below par, I hope Scott Glenn wasn't hoping this would improve his career. Carla Gugino shone best in this film in my honest opinion, but I've seen her act better than this, so can only assume that she realised just how bad it was going too be & didn't give it her all.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour, go watch wallpaper grow, but don't waste over 100 minutes of your life watching this!"

","This movie was thoroughly disappointing. In the previews, it looked like a decent movie. Honestly, I saw this little girl fighting a giant samurai statue holding a Gatling gun (which me and my wife couldn't resist saying enemy death machine spinning up in the theater, CoD humor) in the previews and that got my wife and I in the theater. We both play video games and enjoy visually stunning movie battle scenes. This movie was visually stunning during the fighting scenes but the orphanage scenes were just horrible. Girl is in an mental institute/orphanage, depending on before and after the frontal lobe lobotomy has taken place, and it's all ready been known to everyone there that she's there because her father/step-father wanted to get rid of her and she had accidentally killed her little sister, which is also a lame story-line, trying to protect her. So one of the orphans asks her if she had anyone like a relative on the outside that cared about her. Um? Duh, she's an orphan, and on top of that her background has already been explained... Just so many dumb little things like throughout the entire story; the five things she needed, we were able to call out the list AND where to find the items before she said even it; her killing her sister by firing one shot that broke the light hanging from the ceiling in the closet which somehow managed to ricochet and hit a little girl curled up in the corner of a very small closet. The only positive things I can say is that the movie had very good soundtrack and the visuals were awesome. The movie was kinda fun to laugh at but most of the scenes cause involuntary eye-rolling. Watch with low expectations and it may be decent. But the soundtrack and visuals are the only reason this movie isn't getting a 1 star."

","I can't explain just how much I wanted to love this film. The special effects, the music, the sheer beauty of the sets and actresses, I didn't even conceive the fact this move might be bad. As a fond lover of Watchmen, 300 and Dawn of the Dead I prepared myself for a good fun thrill ride with a simple enough storyline to tie it all together nicely. But as the tag line reads, I was unprepared for what I actually observed.<br/><br/>The film starts very well up until the point Babydoll begins to dance and the fantasies are conveyed to the audience through exaggerated fantasy sequences. I expected them to be of an allegorical nature, each aspect symbolising a facet of her reality, and often found the ties between the dreams and the main plot... minute at best. Whilst these action sequences were fantastic, the rest of the story was flat, the characters thoroughly uninteresting, and I found myself confused by the overly convolute story line; simply waiting for the next erotic or action-packed sequence. And neither came, the move ends abruptly without any real closure, opportunities for fantastic dialogue scenes or intense fighting scenes were hurriedly skipped over leaving a lot to be desired. <br/><br/>With a 12a rating here in the UK, there's nothing very sexually enticing about the film other than some fancy costumes, no real gore or violence and the story line is so weak and inexplicably cluttered that I find the whole film unmemorable. I clung to the hope throughout it may become an artsy film with some deeper meaning, or a tale of female empowerment but every chance to make any such insinuation is passed up, and Sucker Punch, is the utterly unsatisfying result."

","This flick may have had something interesting to say in its juxtaposition of sexual violence toward women and mindless cinematic violence- if it wasn't so busy hypocritically parading a bunch of young girls around in burlesque attire and school girl outfits.<br/><br/>Like Inception, the scenes depicted in this film cease to hold any relevancy to the viewer. After the structure of the film is established it becomes utterly tiresome to watch, limply accosting us with a secondary reality concocted by the film's heroine to cope with the primary reality. We are then intermittently subjected to a tertiary reality the lead uses to cope with the horrors of the secondary reality.<br/><br/>For example, rape in reality #1 = striptease in reality #2 = anime brawl in reality #3. We get it. It's not clever.<br/><br/>The bulk of the film consists of the theft of mundane objects to aid in a breakout attempt. Acquisition of an object in reality #1 = striptease distraction and crafty sleight of hand in reality #2 = 15 minutes of cinematic trash in reality #3.<br/><br/>People who dig it will claim it to be very cerebral when it's really just a vapid excuse for misplaced fetish and video game shenanigans.<br/><br/>By the end, you'll be praying for a visit from Jon Hamm."

While the previews can be a little misleading to what this film is about or where the story takes place, but that's it's purpose. <br/><br/>Sucker Punch delivered an incredible Plot Twist that I was not expecting and the movie was Visually EPIC and engaging! Try to see this film in IMAX just to further enjoy the journey. Even though this film was not what I was expecting and the ending caught me a little off guard and I did enjoy the film. Sucker Punch is definitely worth seeing in theaters at least once! <br/><br/>However Hollywood is really pushing that PG-13 Rating with Sucker Punch which should have never been censored in the first place and remained Rated R! I would not recommend anyone under the age of 16 to see this film because even though they do not show the ""sex scenes"" and they muffle the cursing and somethings don't get shown completely, I'd like to think that teenagers are not that stupid and they'll understand whats going on. <br/><br/>Sucker Punch should have been Rated R and not cut out all the good stuff and a vital scene that helps the ending make more sense.

","Cinematic non-entity Emily Browning stars as an orphan living in some Gothic version of 1950's America. Problems with her ridiculously evil stepdad lands her in a mental hospital (or home for the ""mentally insane"" as the film calls it ... distinguishing from a home for the physically insane I suppose), from which she escapes by ... perhaps ... imagining that she's in a cabaret/brothel where her and a troop of other girls have to dance for the customers. From this fantasy reality she occasionally slips into a further fantasy reality (no, I don't know how that's supposed to work either), where her and the other girls fight dragons and Nazi robots using swords and machine guns. There are elaborate parallels between the 3 levels of reality, but it would be a lie to say I stopped caring because I really never started caring about any of this.

","I hate this phrase, but this movie truly shows ""girl power"". It's extremely sad, but it shows what a person can rise above and how if someone really wants something, to rise above, they can. Like a quote from the movie, ""You have all the weapons, now fight!"". It also proves that there are people who will sacrifice themselves for someone they care about or a cause that they care about. I love how they showed the ""theater"" when Baby Doll first gets there, and then she ends up acting out scenarios in her head that describe how she's feeling, how it feels to fight for something. The best part I think, is the fact that they say, everyone has a guardian angel, they come in different forms, an old man one day and a young girl the next. Most of all, that they aren't here to fight your battles, you're here to fight your battles, they are just here to show you the way and to keep you going. Overall, I think this is a must-see!"
"CrazyEX","1","5","11","22 November 2011"," Overly Simplistic & Misleading
","Oh boy, Suckerpunch...what to make of Suckerpunch...<br/><br/>The movie is basically about a girl who fights back against male oppression(?). The Point of the movie was supposed to be that ""women can do...things...too"", but I've came to believe that it failed on every aspect.<br/><br/>Why was that so? Well, the answer includes every single thing in the movie... I'll start by saying what I did like: The first sequences. The scenes are established by minimal usage of dialogue, and visuals are used very effectively to set up the tone, which is the most impressive thing about Zack Synder; he has a unique style of visuals & setting scenes up. Also, the fact that the movie was not afraid to get dark, was a positive trait. Most movies are afraid to do that, it's gotta count for something.<br/><br/>Now the hard part: The first and most obvious flaw of the movie was the characters. It portrayed every single guy as a villain who is ""out there to get you"". The film literally portrayed men as rapists. Trying to praise one gender by panning another, just does not work. <br/><br/>Also, the girls were supposed to be strong willed, independent characters, but they weren't really. They were just very fetishistic and attractive girls who only could overcome their problems in their own fantasy settings.<br/><br/>The characters didn't feel like real people, and were entirely one dimensional. Every single male character was a villain, and the characters lacked in depth, in general.<br/><br/>Number two, the story. The original idea could work, a troubled girl imagining a harsh setting as a hell-bound fantasy world, but it didn't. The main idea was that the girl fought her way out of 3 separate dimensions of a fantasy world, just like Christopher Nolan's Inception. <br/><br/>At first,she imagines the psych ward as a brothel, where the girls are forced to dance, and they plan an escape from there.<br/><br/>Supposedly the protagonist has a special dance that immediately seduces males (which we don't get to see). The film feels so much like a video game, and this just doesn't mend with the idea of the story. The rest is just some hot girls fighting huge monsters, creatures and other freaks. <br/><br/>It is true, special effects can be used to augment a story, unless it becomes ridiculous, and at this point, it really did.<br/><br/>Another major problem was the lack of any consequences. The tension in a movie is usually created by showing the audience what's at stake, why should we should care for the characters, and what the results would be if the protagonists were to fail. <br/><br/>In this movie, we really couldn't have the time to care for the characters, and the lack of any consequences completely drained the movie out of any tension, as the characters didn't seem to suffer any consequences if they were hurt/injured/killed in their fantasy worlds.<br/><br/>The fact that the girls were virtually indestructible instantly made the film boring. There should've been a line in between the real world and the fantasy world, just like The Matrix. Again, the whole thing felt like a video game.<br/><br/>One of the major points, was that the director's ""real world"", didn't really feel like the real world either, so it just felt like a very long dream (a bad one).<br/><br/>Zack Synder has a very unique & interesting visual style, but that is pushed way too far in this one. This movie was supposed to be, and I'm quoting here, ""a female empowerment film"", but it managed to become the exact opposite. The message it gave was ""Women are seductive, and that's it, they can only fight back in their stupid fantasy worlds, and their imaginations"". Women with tight leather clothes punching things, is really a man thing, nothing but a fetishistic sexual fantasy. ""The only way women can access their inner strength, is by seducing men"" was the main idea I could decipher out of this movie.<br/><br/>Women have intellect, speech, skills, and various other traits that they can use to overcome oppression, but this movie chose a misogynistic approach to all this, and it just didn't work.<br/><br/>I actually could recommend this movie just as another production line movie which is just for the visuals, but I really won't, as the CGI and special effects get ridiculous throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Sorry Zack, Watchmen and 300 were good, but this one was just pushing it."
"thewhole-team","1","5","11","18 November 2011"," Snyder's First Attempt at Writing Falls Short
","When I first saw the trailer for the film I have to say I was cautiously optimistic and having seen other Zack Snyder (Watchmen and 300 were both passable) I was intrigued. With Snyder I knew he was going to jam in as much special effects and slow motion fight scenes as possible,but as with his other films I expected to see an interesting story to go along with it. Unfortunately I was horrible disappointed.<br/><br/>This is Snyders first attempt to direct something he actually wrote himself and not something that came from a graphic novel or book, and it certainly shows. The basic story follows a girl as she is institutionalized by her cruel father and then befriends the other young women in the hospital. Together they escape their harsh reality through fantasy, while they work to free themselves. When you look at it through it's premise alone it's not bad. Abused children escaping into fantasy has been done before many times with success. Pans Labyrinth or Where the Wild Things Are. But unfortunately in Sucker Punch the imagination world isn't really all that imaginative. The world the girls fight in seems to be taken directly from popular culture: girls in cosplay outfits, nazi zombies, orcs, and dragons. It looks more like Comic-Con then an actual movie. <br/><br/>Snyder also attempts to make this fantasy world into a video-game something Scott Pilgrim did in a similar fashion. But while Pilgrim was fun and quirky, the video game style seems out of place in this darker more morbid environment. Even the action scenes, which while awesome for the first hour, get repetitive quickly especially after the second ""level"" of their escape plan. You really don't get any sense that the girls are in any danger in the fantasy realm and the action is so ridiculous it takes you completely out of the movie.<br/><br/>Finally the ending, which might be one of the worst twists I've ever seen. I don't want to give it away if you haven't seen the film but if you aren't scratching your head wondering what just happened, you'll probably be laughing at how terrible it is. I'm honestly tired of people trying to tell those who didn't enjoy Sucker Punch that they don't like it because they don't ""understand it"". People are making this out to be a complex film when it's no better than any of the Transformers films. I understand the ending and just because it might not be what I was expecting doesn't mean it was good or clever. I sat through the whole film hoping that perhaps the ending would someway redeem the time and money I spent, but it only made things worse. <br/><br/>Normally I would only recommend this kind of movie to those who enjoy the mindless action drama but I can't even do that because the action was so cheesy! I can't really recommend this film to anyone."

So me and my friends went to the theatre to see this movie, expecting basically a war-ish kind of movie with an unimportant plot, and the first few minutes of the movie completely astounded me. A touching first scene, in black and white dealing with matters such as death, rape and loss in a sensitive way, as well as injustice. The fact that there was almost no dialogue and a great song definitely made the scene more impacting. The sudden jump to what appeared to be a porn shoot was definitely surprising and frankly confused me to bits, as did the next scene when she ends up in a Chinese pagoda. The action in the movie was solid, and after a while it was easy to get used to skipping between these worlds. As great as the action and the acting was, there definitely were plot holes, such as why Babydoll would leave evidence in the dressing room, but nothing too damaging. The story ties itself off quite well, and mixed with beautiful scenery, excellent effects, and quick-paced action makes for a great movie. In conclusion, a great guy movie, which girls could also enjoy but maybe not as much as men would. It has a pretty good plot, a nice ending and great action scenes,not to mention the good choice in music and the general look of the scenery, outfits, etc."

And how they link these big fight scenes with all girls to them all being in a room with one chick dancing and another one trying to pick a guys pocket has no credible basis in the story. Even tho with out these good visual it would have even been more of a waste than it was. It like who ever wrote the plot was 12 and then whoever edited the movie was 12 and didn't want to have anything linking the pieces of the story together.

","** out of (****)<br/><br/>After Snyder's inexactitude movie productions such as ""300"" and ""Watchmen"", one should be skeptical of how Zack's titillating eye-candy spectacle will pan out. With the plethora of negative critical reception, it's easy to say this project will not be a satisfying one. While that is true, ""Sucker Punch"" may be the most underrated film of the year so far. Granted, it's not a good film, but there's no way it's deserving of a ""1"" or even a ""3"". Despite the film's main selling point being the sex dolls gracing the silver screen, there's a little more meat on these bones. Snyder's first self-written screenplay attempts at a more meaningful, complex world. However, great ideas don't always guarantee a solid execution. ""Sucker Punch"" is a pitch perfect example.<br/><br/>""Punch"" revolves around Babydoll (Browning), our fragile protagonist who is verbally and mentally abused by her stepfather. After a horrible incident, Babydoll is sent to a mental institution, and is expected a lobotomy in a matter of days. However, while serving her time at the place, she dances for others, and is the best of the bunch. Although, when she dances, she's mentally, inside her own world. The others join her in her little fantasy, with a hope to escape. There, the line between reality and fantasy is drawn. Will the girls escape?<br/><br/>First of all, the acting is just decent. Browning is the best of the bunch, but then again, she doesn't have too much to work with. Anyone can bat their voluptuous eyes, and carry a melancholy attitude. Malone is the charismatic, inspiration stereotype. Here she does her job, but doesn't add too much for the camera. The others are pretty much either insignificant or nothing note-worthy of a performance. How's the story? Surprisingly, I think the story fits despite what others say. One being the film's incoherence. The film ties everything up pretty nicely, and has a few twists and turns. <br/><br/>The action? Nothing short of awesome. Snyder has a nice eye for visual entertainment, and he brings it here. The babes? Pretty, but they never bring their expected sex appeal to the screen. Is the film too long? Not really. The film, despite its lengthy running time, doesn't overstay its welcome too much. It's pretty straightforward. Also, not to mention the cinematography is just gorgeous. Snyder is like God in that department.<br/><br/>Now onto the bad. This film just does not work. How can you enter the fantasy world by dancing? Won't that cause distraction, especially since those hot sweaty pedophiles are staring at you. Also, are they that stupid not to realize stealing things will be suspicious? That's a non-spoiler by the way. It's partly shown in the trailer, and happens early on in the movie. These factors kind of got to me. Also, while this is a lovely film to look at, it leaves you in the cold. It really doesn't have any emotional depth and character study, when that's what the movie promises.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Sucker punch"" isn't a complete one to the stomach. The film doesn't rely too heavily on gratuitous nature, but when it relies on characters and story, it gets lost in a way. This film, while flawed, isn't half as bad as the critics say it is. It just isn't as good as some people are saying it is. Stick with a matinée."

I think the actors and actresses portrayed their roles perfectly. I would definitely suggest going to see this move in the theater to truly experience it in it's full element.<br/><br/>If you appreciated the visuals of Watchmen and 300, you will definitely want to catch this movie."

","Yes, The movie had no brains looking from storyline perspective because it is a 10 min storyline presented in a 110 minute stunning show.<br/><br/>I have a tendency to enter a movie theatre with absolutely no expectations, considering so many bad experiences I had, but this was one of the movies I was expecting to watch this year considering this is the first written story by Zack Snyder unlike his previous movies which were adaptations and I am not disappointed.<br/><br/>GOOD PARTS:<br/><br/>1. Presenting a Short story in a magnificent way. - Of course it is Zack Snyder <br/><br/>2. The first 10 minutes - Most of you mayn't admire it the way I did. But no one other than Zack Snyder can do it. <br/><br/>3. The Girls - The main lead Emily Browning was perfect as Baby doll and role of other characters too was well-constructed. <br/><br/>4. The main lead is generally given a lot of focus in most of action-fantasy movies but the attempt was more on presentation of the movie than for building the characters, which is commendable. The entire movie had that awesomeness till the very last minute. <br/><br/>5. The last and most important is the Background score and Tyler Bates at his best which made the action sequences more beautiful. <br/><br/>6. About the ending, ""YES"" I won't say it is splendid but it is not what I expected so I liked it as I already pointed out the movie was not about characters.<br/><br/>BAD PARTS:<br/><br/>1. Some of the action sequences are too fast-panning especially one in the train which could be done better. <br/><br/>2. Honestly, there is nothing called a Bad Part. It is and Action-Girl-fantasy movie ... so there are flaws but that is the least concern...<br/><br/>So, GO Watch it !!! A decent flick that won't disappoint you"

"Ben-Hibburd","7","2","3","19 June 2017"," Sucker Punch Review.
","Did I just watch a film or a music Video?<br/><br/>After giving this film some time sync in, I still find myself highly conflicted towards Sucker Punch. On one hand it's a well made action fantasy film. On the other I have serious issues with the story and it's blatant, poorly conceived foreshadowing that constantly took me out of the film.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch tells the story of a young woman(Babydoll the name given to her) played by Emily Browning whose father has recently passed. She and her sister have inherited his fortune, much to the anger and jealousy of her abusive stepfather. After a fatal accident she is blamed for her sisters death and put into an asylum where she is scheduled to have a lobotomy in five days time at the behest of her stepfather, who's trying to cover up what really happened.<br/><br/>The opening ten minutes where all this plays out like a video game cut scene was frustrating. Whilst I appreciate dialogue free visual storytelling it's filled with every annoying visual motif in Zack Snyders locker. Slow motion, crane shots, colourless pallet and rock music that was distracting and didn't fit the tone of what was happening on-screen.<br/><br/>As the film progresses to the asylum we are Introduced to Oscar issac who plays Blue Jones the head guard, and the one that's essentially running the asylum. I burst out laughing when I initially saw him. He essentially looks like a pimp that has escaped from a 1970's Roger Corman film. After getting myself accustomed to his unique costume design, he's one of the strongest parts of the film. He gives a terrific menacing performance filled intensity and a certain amount of instability.<br/><br/>Emily Browning plays the lead character of Babydoll in the film. Once she's at the asylum, she is sent to what is essentially a brothel section of the asylum. Here she has to learn to dance for the patrons of the establishment. We are then introduced to Dr. Gorski whose the madame of the brothel, played by Carla Gugino. With five days till her lobotomy and the horrors of the asylum, she decides to plan an escape with help of a group of other inmates.<br/><br/>The first thirty minutes of the film I found to be Incredibly dull and infuriating. The story plods along without much interest, except for when the camera spends extra long time on what will be key items for the escape, that will then be revealed later in the film. No prizes for guessing what they are when you watch the film, as Snyder makes sure to insult the audiences intelligence, and make sure that everyone knows what they need to know without giving any credence to subtlety.<br/><br/>At this point of the film I had lost most of patience and was getting close to turning the film off. However when Babydoll goes into her first dance routine, the film completely changes gear. She mentally transports herself to other worlds/settings. When this happens the film springs into life, and becomes an utter joy to watch. The best part of this film is the second dance sequence where Babydoll and her friends are transported to steampunk version of World War 2. The girls have to fight through trenches filled with steampunk Nazis that look like a cross between mad max and Wolfenstein. This set piece is really well shot and edited. Zack Snyder knows how to frame and execute excellent, choreographed action sequences. There are also many great nods and tributes to fantasy cinema in this film.<br/><br/>This makes the film all the more Infuriating. There are moments of cinematic magic filled with breathtaking set pieces, that are engaging and a joy to behold. When the film is focused On these moments it works brilliantly. However there are long periods of this film, especially the first half that are dull and fall flat. This is an original film which I'm always happy to see Hollywood produce. The execution however let this film down. Some of Snyder's choices left me scratching my head, the music in this film is terrible save for the one original song, it's all made up of pre-existing rock music that clashes tonally with the film. Plus another issue I had with the film, was the poorly thought-out juxtaposition between the grey dull hospital scenes and the colourful fantasy world, and leaves little to the imagination as to where the film is heading.<br/><br/>There's a lot of fun to be had with Sucker Punch. I went into it with no expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised by the film. It has excellent action set pieces, and the film shines when it's focused on these sequences. Unfortunately it doesn't out-weigh the dull and poorly executed first act, and the ill-conceived tonal shifts. Despite the films flaws there is a fun time to be had with this film, which in time has cult classic written all over it."

","Complaining about this movie is like complaining that a Monet is blurry, or that Memento is confusing. This isn't a linear allegory where each thing exactly represents something, and the construction isn't linear.

","It's dark in lots of ways, well, alright not lots of ways, just two in fact. The first is the way it's filmed and the second ids the subject matter.<br/><br/>Two girls whom I think are in their teens, one older than the other by I think 3-5 years see their Mother covered by a sheet obviously dead. They both breakdown crying. The man you see looks at her will and sees she has left everything to the two girls. This angers him and he takes it out on the older sister by abusing her, something you could tell he had done many times before. She escapes out of the house and he then abuses the younger sister. The older one comes back with a gun and takes a shot at him, misses him, hits a pipe and deflects into her sister killing her. The man then hands her to a mental hospital which is just a front for a brothel and we find out the man is her step-father, meaning she is now an orphan, and the only way she can get out of it is when she is forced to dance for the male version of a Madam she creates fantasy scenarios and these are just superb! All bar the first one involve all of the girls in the scenarios they all have a different personality than out of the scenarios. the C. G. I. is brilliant and as all of the scenes outside of the fantasy scenes were filmed in a dark, depressing, dreary way I thought the ones in them would be happy and colourful and bright but they weren't. they filmed in the same style as the scenes outside and it suited them perfectly! The C. G. I. was superb the action sequences were superbly choreographed and the directing is brilliant! THIS IS ANOTHER MUST SEE FILM! I'm off to see if I can add it to my D. V. D. collection!"
"moonknight-4","9","2","3","18 May 2012"," More than I expected
","When I saw the trailers (and came across a few reviews) . I was ready for a dumb movie with hot girls and overdone action . which was fine by me :) but while the movie does have AWESOME fantasy action scenes and beautiful girls it surely is ain't stupid .<br/><br/>I don't know , maybe people do only ""see what they wanna see"" . but they miss out a lot of things by doing that . the whole movie is treated like a music video , with beautiful artistic shots played on the soundtrack . and it was hard for me not to feel bad for the main character , and the other girls in the so called ""asylum"" . I could identify with the fear they felt from being supervised by that master douchebag that runs the place . and the movie delivers a depressing feeling overall ... until 1 girl stands up for herself and brings hope to the rest .<br/><br/>And it's funny how this movie is accused with putting women down when the whole idea of the movie is to talk ABOUT how they used to be treated , their struggle against it , and in the fantasy world she built in her head they have so much power and freedom (while still looking sexy - and there's nothing wrong in that) ,as they weren't treated as just sex objects by the story , they were breaking away from that tag someone put on them , making it possible to care for them as people . and while these adrenaline packed scenes put a smile on my face they were also emotionally charged and made you wonder - how do they effect the real life in the meantime .<br/><br/>Suprizingly enough - the movie wasn't over sexualized , or violent . (maybe people are disappointed because that's what they wanted it to be ?) and I'm glad it didn't , weather it's for rating reasons or not , it managed to produce some of the most amazing action scenes we ever had in a movie to date , without being too bloody . and while sex was a big theme in this movie , it wasn't just randomly put there (like a lot of movies do) but was part of the story , and even there it was merely implied , bringing focus to whats really important . I would even go as far and say there was something ""feminist"" about this movie . as 99 percent of the male characters were just hateful . well , except that old guy ...<br/><br/>so remember , don't believe any review you read before you judge it by yourself ...oh and one more thing - the movie starts and ends with a great message . so don't let that go over your head ..."
"mindsci","9","2","3","26 February 2012"," Watch the ""R"" Rated Version! (review of R rated version).
","I know there are/were a lot of people that didn't like or get this movie. I bought the Blu-Ray set when it first came out and watched the ""R"" rated version first- I'm glad I did! I subsequently watched the Theatrical Release, and WOW, the film was butchered for that studio coveted ""PG-13""! <br/><br/>This is no kids movie!(R version). It is and can be quite dark, disturbing, and tragic, but if you watch this version you will most definitely get the ""ending"". <br/><br/>Babydoll is plunged into a dreamy and nightmarish world of (akin to) a psychotic break, and real horrors, by her evil stepfather. This is the world we are privy to. She is forced into an existence of ""lucid dreaming""... Where would you go if you were stripped of all control, all that you loved, and any hope for the future? <br/><br/>The ""break"" or ""dream"" is a world of fantastical sensory overload. As such, it is a joy to behold as it unfolds choppily and meanders through the dreamscape. But, second and subsequent film viewings will be extremely flat as all has become predictable. So be sure to pay attention the first time you watch Sucker Punch- all the more reason to forgo the Theatrical Release if you haven't seen it yet.<br/><br/>Emily Browning definitely exudes a lot of sexual tension. She was equally erotic in ""The Uninvited"" when she was 21. There is something about those plump pouting lips! All the more for the dreamscape effect in Sucker Punch!<br/><br/>Zack Snyder films are most definitely ""Sensory Feasts"" when seen in the theater. I would have loved to see the real (""R"" rated) version of this in 3D on the big screen. However, I still found that the Blue-Ray ""R"" version delivered nicely on a substantial home theater system- Damn those ""coveted PG-13's!"
"Schnayblay","8","2","3","12 December 2011"," My Mind Just Took A ""Sucker Punch""
","This movie blew my mind. ""Sucker Punch"" is, in short, about the delusions within the delusions of a crazy chick. That's pretty much all you need to know. Think of the 'dreams within dreams' case from ""Inception"". Just like that.<br/><br/>The plot, well, there barely is one, but in all honesty. I don't care. But for those of you who want a bit more than ""about a crazy chick"", here you go. Babydoll kills her sister by accident, and assaults her step-father. He takes her to an asylum, where Babydoll retreats into her mind and imagines it an old 1930's-1940's brothel, so she doesn't have to deal with the pain of being in a psycho prison. Within this ""brothel"", a requirement to ""work"" there is to dance. But Babydoll doesn't know how to. Her dance instructor, Madame Gorski, tells Babydoll to let her mind go, and somehow, that makes Babydoll imagine she's fighting a 20 foot gorilla-samurai with a chain-gun! It's messed up. So in basic, Babydoll plans to escape the asylum with the help of her friends, but along the way, she has to dance every once and a while, so we get more epic fight scenes. That's the best way I can think of putting the plot. And, I'm sure you're still a bit confused. Don't worry.<br/><br/>As for acting, well, again, I don't think it matters. There's decent performances, and Vanessa Hudgens breaks the bond from her ""High School Musical"" days and shows she can kick ass! <br/><br/>Those are the best words for this film: Kick-Ass. The action is insane, over the top, amazing, beautifully choreographed and most of all, intense. The situations the girls are thrown into are ridiculous. One time, their in a D&D setting with an assault helicopter fighting a giant dragon over an egg. Then they're on a futuristic train trying to stop a bomb whilst killing every NS5 from ""I, Robot"" they see.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, is surprisingly, amazing. Every action scene is driven by a sick remix of incredible songs, from ""White Rabbit"" by Jefferson Airplane, to ""When the Levee Breaks"" by Led Zeppelin. It's freaking fantastic.<br/><br/>I'll say one thing about ""Sucker Punch"". I saw this with my mother and she LOVED it, and she normally watches a movie once and that's it. She wants to buy this. When you get my mother's approval, you got something good. Hell, my mom said even she noticed the soundtrack and would totally buy it. That is a ground-breaking achievement, and also proving this is not just a guy movie. Though I have to say, a group of girls with names such as Babydoll wearing school girl outfits slicing and dicing will get any guys attention. Don't even bother renting ""Sucker Punch"", just buy it."
"Red_Identity","Null","2","3","2 December 2011"," Very odd, but thrilling
","The way most people talk about Sucker Punch sort of had me thinking it wasn't just a regular action film. The film has a few supporters, but they REALLY support it. So I finally saw it. I thought I would probably think it was mediocre, but I didn't, and here are my thoughts...<br/><br/>It started off rather annoying. Slow-motion action didn't stop, but after about 5 minutes, I got into it. I knew this would be a film to just enjoy. The slow-motion visual images really interested me. As did the film, as it kept going it was sort of odd, even for Snyder. I don't know how to judge the script or the story, but it was working a lot. The musical number in the beginning is what I really loved. Swirl of images to stay in my head. The film finally came to a regular plot, and yet it wasn't what I had expected. Not only are we aware that this is actually a dream or fantasy, but inside this fantasy where she is prisoner as well, whens he 'dances' she enters a video game (not literally). That's all it was, a video game, and heck, I enjoyed it! Some of the 'dance' action scenes got a little repetitive by the 2nd dance, but the 3rd 'dance' with the robots I really enjoyed. That's all that matters, that scene by scene I was still invested. <br/><br/>Overall, the film wasn't anything original, but its execution and style somehow were. It definitely stands apart from other action films, but it doesn't feel too serious. I hope Snyder doesn't take it so seriously either, but in its own way this is a very ambitious film. I liked it, a lot. It's the sort of film that is not hurt by negative criticism. It's the rare film where it feels like it doesn't care what others think of it, and that's actually pretty rare. It isn't the incredible film that the Ultimate Cut of Watchmen is, but it's very good, if not great in its ability to transcend feelings and images in a certain unique way, even when the characters themselves are 2-D."
"derflive","Null","2","3","10 September 2011"," Confused about the plot of Zack Snyder's masterpiece Sucker Punch? Read this theory which will answer all the questions you lay have about this movie.
","When you have read other reviews like I have, you will have noticed that a few theories are very widely spread. One is about the dancing sequences of Babydoll being her escape from being raped. The other one is of Sweet Pea being the lead character and it's all her imagination we see and not Babydoll's. I will try and explain why these two theories are wrong.<br/><br/>The imaginative part of the movie starts and ends with the doctor hammering the lobotomy tool through Babydoll's brain. This is the first and most direct evidence of it all actually being Babydoll's imagination and no one else's. The other, more confusing evidence for this is the wise man/bus driver. This has a lot of people confused. The fact that we see the wise man appear as the bus driver can be explained as follows: When Babydoll and Sweet Pea escaped the asylum we think we see the real world events, not the fantasy. Yet, they are still wearing their brothel outfits. So this must still be the fantasy part. The switch between real life and the fantasy world in this part of the movie is why we get thrown off. Rewatch these scenes to understand what I'm talking about. In the extended version of the movie, we can see Sweet Pea taking down a dress from someones clothing line. It is this dress she wares at the bus station in the movies final scene. In the final shot of the movie we can see a billboard that has ""Paradise Diner"" written on it. Remember Sweet Pea telling Babydoll to ""write her a postcard from Paradise""? This is yet another hint to the fact that we are actually seeing Babydoll's fantasy of Sweet Peas escape. Babydoll is taken away by the security guards just as Sweet Pea passes the main gate of the asylum. What happens after that is not known by Babydoll. Unfortunately, Dr. Grovsky fails to mention what happened too. She mentions that Babydoll helps Sweet Pea escape, but she doesn't say if she stayed out of the hands of the guards. She may have been caught later on. We don't know.<br/><br/>Now for the dancing sequences. It is being made very clear in the complete story that the only time that girls are being assaulted (if at all) is after they have been lobotomized. Since these are Babydoll's fantasies from before her lobotomizing, we can assume that she is not being raped by that fact alone. Not by Blue anyway. The only scene where she may have been assaulted is when she dances for the cook. I believe what happened in the real world at that time is that the cook (being defeated earlier by Babydoll when she rescues Rocket from him) now tries to rape Babydoll. The cook once again fails in his attempts, because Rocket, returning the favor, rescues Babydoll from the hands of the cook. They other dancing sequences may be group sessions, led by Dr. Grovsky. They are generally not something she is suppressing even in her fantasy substitute of the occurrences at the asylum. They are merely a transfer to the second level of fantasy. Whenever she dances, one of the other girls is stealing one of the required items. Anothert hing we have to remember is that it is being made very clear that her virginity is being saved by Blue for the High Roller. And in the brothel's final scenes Babydoll says to Blue, right after stabbing him in the left shoulder that ""he will never have her, EVER"". This statement directly implies that he has also never had her before that time."

I noticed some good things, but some areas of improvement too. It is not among my favourites of the year, but I think there are much worse movies released this year.<br/><br/>PROS: Sucker Punch's visuals are spectacular, the case with all of Zack Snyder's movies. The cinematography and editing are excellent, and the costumes, settings and effects likewise.<br/><br/>There is also an atmospheric soundtrack, stylish direction from Snyder and good performances from Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Jenna Melone Vanessa Hudgens and Oscar Isaac.<br/><br/>Plus I loved Sucker Punch's idea. It was original and very interesting.<br/><br/>CONS: Despite this great idea, Sucker Punch doesn't quite live up to it in the execution of the storytelling. The story had this great concept and started off wonderfully, but as the film progresses it does get increasingly bewildering and convoluted.<br/><br/>Pacing is also uneven. The film could have been longer, so the film could have had more time to explain itself further, and some of the middle feels a little pedantic.<br/><br/>The script does have some stilted moments as well, and the characters while intriguing and decently acted could have done with more development.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Sucker Punch has its good points, but some assets could have been better. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

","Zack Snyder is no misogynist he's clearly just dumb. This astonishingly boring mess is so weak it can't even manage to register let alone be offensive or even silly. Joyless and clunky, the action is drab, dated, repetitive and spineless, how the acting or dialogue were deemed acceptable by anyone involved is beyond me.<br/><br/>It fails on an epic scale on every level, if this is supposed to make even the sweatiest of fan boys happy I think the director has the lowest opinion of them that borderlines contempt. No one should claim female empowerment when attempting to convey said message with cheaply made up mannequins who cower constantly in lolita dress-up and smudged mascara. And no matter how shallow your viewing standards this was just dull, where was the fun? Simply a pointless misjudgment by a gimmicky hack."

The opening and closing voices aren't Babydoll, which tells us that she is not the main character. Since it's Sweet Pea who speaks to us at the beginning, and it's Sweet Pea who escapes at the end, She is the main character, and the film is her story.<br/><br/>With that in mind, all of the sequences we see throughout the film are Sweet Pea's interpretations of the mental landscape Babydoll experiences while hatching the plans, and how Sweet Pea interprets Babydoll's view of the fights while executing them.<br/><br/>Taken in that light, the writing on this film explodes into the realm of arthouse films."

","I had long heard about this flick, which was supposed to be slowly becoming a cult movie since its release, when I finally watched it on TV a week ago. I knew it featured impressive visuals, action and violent scenes, but I had no idea what the plot was about.<br/><br/>'Sucker punch' happened to be one of those movies that are aesthetically based on Japanese video-games and aimed at a young male audience. This means: hot girls, weapons, explosions, and a series of challenges. But that was not everything.<br/><br/>The plot was actually compelling. There were three reality levels: the 'real' one, where the main characters are locked in a mental hospital; an oniric one, where there is supposed to be a brothel and the main characters are exploited (never visually, though) and a fantastic one that grows out of the latter and where they basically live in an action video game.<br/><br/>All in all, I think the movie is interesting and has a hidden message against female abuse.

","Zack Snyder treads on extremely thin ice and survives. Fishnets, exposed midriffs of Emily Browning and attractive lingerie keep SUCKER PUNCH afloat. Snyder who clearly proves himself as a near perfectionist with his visual treats and CGI addiction raised the bar on himself with SUCKER PUNCH. I am certain if he brings the same game to theaters in 2013 with MAN OF STEEL we are in for a whole new Clark Kent Experience. LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS, WATCHMEN and more specifically 300 are a few of Snyder's great works. The success of SUCKER PUNCH therefore is not much a surprise.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly a very boyish movie this is. A plot that switches between 3 realms. Reality, fantasy and fantasy within a fantasy. (Now where have we heard something quite similar before? A dream within a dream within a dream!) Baby Doll (Emily Browning) who is mourning her mothers' death with her younger sister faces her step fathers' fury when he finds out that his late wife has left all her possessions to her daughters in her final will. In a failed attempt to save her sister Baby Doll ends up shooting her step father and killing her own sister. Baby Doll then is taken to the Lennox House for the Mentally Insane by her step father who falsely accuses her of being mentally unstable. It is here that she meets Blondie ( Vanessa Hudgens), Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone) and my favorite Amber ( Jamie Chung). <br/><br/>This is where Baby Doll finds her escape to the land of fantasy where the mental house turns into a brothel and all the girls are dancers. This is also where she finds yet another realm within the fantasy that takes the 5 girls to fight cyborgs, fire breathing dragons, dead German soldiers from World War 1 and even creatures that seem to have escaped Mordor. This is also where baby doll first meets her personal guru; the wise man (Scott Glenn) in an ancient Chinese temple. <br/><br/>SUCKER PUNCH is everything that can be done right in terms of visual effects and CGI. SUCKER PUNCH puts certain superheroes to SUPER SHAME! The only thing that comes nearly as close to the visuals in the movie is the powerful soundtrack. As for the performances, none seem to be moving or none does deserve a standing ovation. The movie needed the girls to look pretty and fill in onto the highly artificially developed graphical frames. Although they are not nod worthy, they are commendable since everything does feel real and quite attractive from where I am seated. The only question that was thrown at me was this. Yes and this was directed at me by the female audience. In what sort of world would a girl's fantasy have her fighting Dragons in fishnets and cheerleader out fits and even at times revealing lingerie? The answer is not complicated rather a very simple one. In a very imaginative mans world this is how battles are fought.<br/><br/>Final factor that makes this movie stand out is the relation it has to the world of Play station and XBOX. The feel of a gaming realm gives it an even sharper edge. It's not horrible as SCOTT PILGRIM VS THE WORLD. In stead this is text book of how a video gaming feel could be related to a movie.<br/><br/>So many good things go on in this Snyder production with one flaw of the plot. Nothing too unique. It felt SHUTTER ISLAND minus the lead male and plus 5 lead females.<br/><br/>Nothing More Nothing Less<br/><br/>Title: Sucker Punch Directed by: Zack Snyder Starring: Emily Browning, Vanessa Hudgens, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Jamie Chung, Carla Gugino, Oscar Isaac, Scott Glenn and John Ham Rated: Rating: 07/10"

","I agree with the first reviewer that gave this movie time to sink in. As I find the themes popping up in conversations in coffee shops and cocktail parties, the violence fades as the shear creative fantasy of considering all options in creating art in life. In creating beauty, artists have to have the freedom to consider all the options, IMHO. Both good and bad, and the conscious choice of beauty as the Dr. Suess book: I have brains in my head and shoes on my feet, which way I go depends on me. <br/><br/>Most choices are situational as the dance in this movie, imagine the creativity once given the freedom to let freedom sing.

","I'm going to risk sounding cliché, but when a film's main focus is great visuals, somewhere down the line the ball is dropped in exchange, and naturally, the victim that receives the most gouging is the film's potential to tell a compelling story. And in some ways, it can be argued that director and first-time writer Zack Snyder attempts to tell such a story in which a girl is wrongfully placed in a mental institute for girls and plans to break out. The problem is, however, whatever Zack Snyder is trying to convey through the story's premise can suddenly be thrown out the window when audiences watch this same girl suddenly go into flights of fantasy in which she is an ass-kicking, katana-wielding babe in a skimpy sailor outfit, duking it out against giant stone samurai toting mini-guns, re-animated ghoul Nazi soldiers, and robots straight from the iRobot movie reject, but less lame. Of course, these are dreams within dreams, much like Inception, except the girls imagine they are harlots forced to entertain in a burlesque house instead of a looney bin, while still having the other illusions of fighting in worlds straight from a video game. Trying to make sense as to how girls in 1940s-ish could imagine combating robots, let alone piloting steam-punk mecha, could prove fruitless.<br/><br/>Does the film fail because of this? Not necessarily. But it leaves some missed opportunities to build these characters, at least care more of their plight. There are some intriguing characters present on the stage Snyder has created, but we never get past their limited dimensionality. Most wooden of them all, Baby Doll, the aptly named protagonist, is easier on the eyes than her performance on screen.<br/><br/>Aforementioned, if Sucker Punch does a few things right, one is the combat dream sequences, which illustrates a dance Baby Doll and company use to distract their captors and collect items needed for their grand escape. These scenes are full of high octane, kinetic energy. But the film isn't afraid to slow things down a little, figuratively and literally, and is not without some of Snyder's signature revving into and out of slow-mo that could make The Matrix blush.<br/><br/>The Bottom Line: Those expected more from Sucker Punch than a sequence of sexy girls kicking the tar out of mutant samurai, ghoul Nazi, and robots, with some story sprinkled of a breakout from a mental institute, will be sorely disappointed. Otherwise, Sucker Punch is a visceral visual kick in the teeth."

","While I love these silly strange movies that are just visual artwork on film. I can't help but feel like I am watching my younger brother play a video game with some of these movies. <br/><br/>This one was the MOST like a video game I have ever seen! With levels and HEAVY CGI what is the difference? Who's the player? Why my Samsung Bluray player that's who and he, I'd like to think my Samsung is a he, kick some real butt and finished this game faster then any game I have ever played on my Xbox. <br/><br/>This isn't a film as much as its a preview for how video games will look in the future! Xbox 720 we welcome you! It was awesome though, I did like it even if I found the story to be very lacking. How you know a story is poorly written is if you are asking yourself for more then one minute ""Uh what happened? Why are they not in a mental institution anymore and now in a burlesque house?"". I had to ask that for awhile because it was never really established when they went from one to the other. Though I figured she was imagining the scene only because I have seen other movies before that have done this same sort of thing.<br/><br/>Overall its a fun movie and the kind you can watch if you don't feel like thinking very much. Just like a video game. Those who have watched this movie, they know what I mean, no one can't say they didn't feel like they watched a video game because that's all SuckerPunch was."

","Sucker Punch smacks you down!<br/><br/>This movie is a softly violent blend of Kill Bill and Inception with a touch of Lord of the Rings, Terminator and Mortal Kombat thrown in for good measure. Unlike Inception, this movie succeeds because it isn't didactically trying to make you buy into the premise, it just lays out the story, and let's you decide what might or might not be going on.<br/><br/>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the creative mix of both the action dream sequences, and to a lesser degree the character development. There is much subtlety crafted into this plot and the main character's subjugations and aspirations. <br/><br/>If I have one gripe, the use of sepia and dark grayscale tones throughout the movie is overused. This was obviously the film maker's intent to bring out color when it does appear, as in the dragonfire, alas I feel true color could have been used to more advantage, so long as it didn't rise to the over color saturation movies like Avatar fell prey to.<br/><br/>Absolutely recommended if you like intense kung fu surreality flicks!"

","After reading several reviews, I have to say that I am surprised by all the negative reviews, and I think the reason for this is that a lot of people didn't understand it fully. Admittedly, I didn't expect much when I first watched this movie. I thought it was just going to be another typical guy movie with sexy girls fighting and I only watched it because my boyfriend wanted to, but it wasn't like that at all. I'm a girl, and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was an action film, with a good thought provoking plot (if you understand it, that is), and yea, the girls were sexy, but they weren't really overly sexy. Think about it, there was no nudity, no sex, not even any direct talk about sex, and the costumes were more suggestive than outright sexy. The girls wear tight clothes, and short skirts, but in actuality most of their bodies are covered.<br/><br/>The film has several layers to it. The first is of a young girl, called Babydoll being taken to a mental hospital after being abused by her stepfather, there she goes into a fantasy world of a burlesque/brothel type place where she meets the other girls and plans to escape. The third level is a series of battles that the girls fight, and the stories of Babydoll's dances.<br/><br/>Some of the reviews on here from women say that they hated it because it objectified the women, but, to me, as a woman, I didn't perceive it that way at all. If anything, it was women taking back their power and kicking ass. I can see why someone would view it that way, but I think if they really thought about it they might see it differently. In the end of the movie it was shown that Blue sexually assaulted the girls, which implies that they had to give him what he wanted if they wanted to survive in the hospital, therefore, it makes sense that the fantasy world is a brothel. The girls themselves feel objectified. Within this fantasy world Babydoll realizes that people, men in particular become engrossed with her dancing. This allows the girls to get the items they need in order to escape. The men are so preoccupied with the girls' sexuality that they essentially give them the upper hand.<br/><br/>To round it out, the special effects were great, and the soundtrack was amazing. It was mostly, if not all, covers of songs, but they were done in a different way. Emily Browning has a very sweet voice that worked great with the songs she sang. All in all, this movie was good, and original, but I would only recommend it to people who like complex story lines. And if you're looking for a movie with lots of blood/gore and sex, then this is not for you."

","If film is about imagination and exploring life through a visual representation of one persons intention then Sucker punch is a film.<br/><br/>It marries complex game play where you can feel the challenges and the visceral achievement of completing each level, even the rhythm matches that of playing an adventure game.<br/><br/>The game play immersion allows the complete belief in the visual art that someone had to imagine prior to creation on film.<br/><br/>You look forward to the story telling through the imagination of the lead character and this adds to the sense of escapism, it gives you permission to suspend judgement and experience the art because, at the back of the story you know it is happening in someone else's mind.<br/><br/>The writers tread a fine line between to much, which would tip the viewer over the edge into non belief and the joy of experiencing scenes that you accept only after recovering from them.<br/><br/>Something happens to us as we grow up scary movies no longer scare us, love stories no longer make us blush and super hero's no longer have us wanting to wear their costumes and jump fences.<br/><br/>This movie took me to the time that I miss when it was easy for me to believe in the story despite its unrecognizable place in reality."

From the time Baby Doll gets her weapons the film really came alive for me. I enjoyed the action sequences (loved the dragon), and the hot outfits. You may have a difficult time trying to figure out which of the girls is the most attractive (I settled on the Amber character). But for many the plot will be confusing and hard to follow.

","At least that's the case with Baby Doll in ""Sucker Punch"". Being housed in the Lennox House which houses the mentally insane, she plans to escape the facility with four other girls. In the process, the girls need to collect five things: a map of the entire facility, an item that can start a fire, a knife, the key to all the doors in the whole facility, and a mystery that only Baby Doll can retrieve. <br/><br/>What's appealing about the movie is the visual effects and the action scenes. I enjoyed these scenes thoroughly. Ninjas, machine guns, bombs, even dragons are all here to create some noise. The rendering of the alternative world and all the sets are amazing. These two things are definitely the key points of this movie.<br/><br/>However, everything else was average, to mediocre, or even to poor.<br/><br/>The plot was quite simple and I believe that the filmmakers could have done a better job on that. The film opens with a teenager nicknamed Baby Doll (Emily Browning) crying with her sister over their mother's death. Because of that, they have to live with their cruel father. After the sisters' father read his wife's final will and testament, he gets angry and kills Baby Doll's younger sister. Later, Baby Doll is accused of being her sister's killer and is later brought to the Lennox House with her father claiming that she is mentally ill. Baby Doll later meets four other girls: Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), and Amber (Jamie Chung). The five girls then plan to escape the facility. Here's the strange part: the girls later enter their own imaginative world where they fight against the ninjas and others to obtain the five items in the alternative world, as well as in the real world. <br/><br/>Bizarre and simple the plot is, the acting and the script were also cheesy. The acting was unconvincing sometimes and the script sounds awkward in some parts of the film. <br/><br/>The characters also got ridiculous names. I know it's their nicknames, but, a fighting warrior whose tough is named Baby Doll? What? That's not all. Sweet Pea? Amber, Rocket, and Blondie still sounded better than Sweet Pea and Baby Doll. <br/><br/>To point out, there were several unanswered questions that struck my brain through the movie, with answers I'm very curious to find out. Whenever the girls want to go to the world in their heads, Baby Doll must dance to a rock song (I guess) before they can go in and kick ass. In one scene where Baby Doll dances the routine for the first time, she enters the world in her head and fights against three 10-foot-tall ninjas. She jumped around, ran around, screamed in pain, sliced her enemies, and dodged attacks. When she's back in the real world, she received laurels from everyone for her ""amazing"" dance. The question is, how did she dance? Could she be really slicing the air, jumping around the room, and screaming around in her dance? <br/><br/>That's not the only one. There are more. Another one is that when the girls visit their imaginative world for the first time, why didn't they feel amazed? I know it's their imagination, but, a little ""wow"" or surprised look. Instead, they look like they've been into their world for a thousand times often. <br/><br/>The last one I want to point out (but I'm sure there are still others in the movie still yet to be discovered) is that how in the world did Baby Doll fight against the ninjas in her imagination, winning the fight, when she's fighting using high heels? If you observe, she fights around using high heels, dodging the opponents' strikes and attacks. I mean, I've never seen a person, fight and dodging attacks with high heels. Imagine Alice from ""Resident Evil"" running around shooting zombies, escaping from the zombies using high heels. <br/><br/>That's all to discuss about the movie. Overall, ""Sucker Punch"" is a winner in terms of action scenes and visual effects. However, the acting, script, and the things that made me confused were mediocre to poor. The film would've gotten a low score if it weren't for the visual effects and the action scenes. But because of the two, the film was desperate enough to earn a 7 for me. <br/><br/>In terms of recommendation, ""Sucker Punch"" is recommended for those who look forward to action scenes, great visual effects, and (possibly) hot girls. I don't think this movie would be suitable for kids because of the violence and the prominence of the girls. But it's up to you parents. <br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Sucker Punch"" is an entertaining two-hour adventure of stunning visual effects and action scenes, with everything else mediocre to poor.<br/><br/>Prince AJB's Score: 70%"

He quickly takes her to a mental institute for young teen girls. (BTW ALL of that happened in the span of the opening credits.) upon arrival, babydoll learns that she will be falsely lobotomized by the end of the week b/c her stepfather paid the evil orderly 2K to forge the main doc's signature, thus prohibiting babydoll to be able to talk to the police (again, all of this info is divulged within the first 15 mins of the movie) in the next scene babydoll is strapped to a chair and prepared for her lobotomy when she is thrown into an alternate reality where she is an orphan being dropped off at a club by a priest (her stepfather) she is told that because she is a virgin she will wait for the end of the week when a 'high roller' who is willing to pay a lot of money will be in the club and thus will ""pluck her flower"". babydoll is called out by the dance teacher (also known as the main doctor in the real reality) to practice a dance, and so when she closes her eyes; she is once again transported to yet another alternate reality where she gets weapons and fights big guys (awesome scene!) when she is finished kicking @ss in a sailor moon outfit she is transported back into the 1st alternate reality... and this ""back and forth jumping from the 1st alternate reality to the 2nd one"" goes on for the next 1 hour and 40 mins. until it ends in the original reality (the one where she is in the mental institute) overall awesome fight/action scenes, but boring storyline/plot for the rest of the movie...<br/><br/>ultimately this is a movie for guys of ALL ages who like hot girls in short skirts, guys who play video games, and people that like to see things blow up. as a woman i liked seeing ""girl power"", hair and makeup fashions, and the end glittery sailor moon outfit was AAWWEESSOME!! while my husband (who likes hot girls and video games) appreciated the action and girl scenes i was appreciating the glittery tights and awesome buckle platform heels (wondering if the ""sucker punch"" costume will be available at Halloween express this October) I give it 5 stars for the action and pretty factor, but only 5 stars b/c the plot and storyline left me going ""eeeh"""

","Before you thumb down my review for praising it to much, let me say that, even though I'm 15, Im not an average 15 year old when it comes in the way of film. I hated the Hangover, (everybody else I know loves it,) my favorite movie is American history X, and I've seen somewhere between 100-200 movies, many being classics or movies in the top 250. With that being said, I LOVED this movie.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the ads or looked it up yet, Sucker punch is, according to Warner Brothers, ""An action fantasy set in the vivid imagination of a young girl whose dream world provides the ultimate escape from her darker reality. Unrestrained by the boundaries of time and place, she is free to go where her mind takes her, and her incredible adventures blur the lines between what's real and what is imaginary. She has been locked away against her will, but Babydoll (Emily Browning) has not lost her will to survive. Determined to fight for her freedom, she urges four other young girls -- the outspoken Rocket (Jena Malone), the street-smart Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), the fiercely loyal Amber (Jamie Chung) and the reluctant Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) -- to band together and try to escape their terrible fate at the hands of their captors, Blue (Oscar Isaac), Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino) and the High Roller (Jon Hamm). Led by Babydoll, the girls engage in fantastical warfare against everything from samurais to serpents, with a virtual arsenal at their disposal. Together, they must decide what they are willing to sacrifice in order to stay alive. But with the help of a Wise Man (Scott Glenn), their unbelievable journey -- if they succeed -- will set them free.""-quoted from Warner brothers Summary.<br/><br/>So, you're probably already saying one of two things. 1. ""This movie sounds awesome!"" or 2. ""This movie sounds really dumb and written by a horny scriptwriter."" Honestly, when I first saw the trailer to this movie, I thought the second thing. However, 2 weeks before the movie came out for me, I saw a TV spot for the movie. I got curious again. I looked at the trailer from a different point of view, and I saw something that many movies lack today. Pure Entertainment. Just, pure unadulterated entertainment. As the days grew closer, I was growing in anticipation to see this movie. On March 25th, opening day, a friend and I went to see it. We both were blown away.<br/><br/>Not only was this movie full of action, but the storyline was, surprisingly, great. As was the acting, music, sets, etc. Probably the most haunting performance was Oscar Issac as Blue, the main antagonist. He is an absolute prick on screen, not like most villains in movies today, who are more funny then scary. The best song used in this movie was sweet dreams by Emily Browning, right in the beginning in the movie. I could go on and on about why I loved this movie, but I must stress one thing. DON'T READ ANY REVIEWS FROM MAINSTREAM NEWSPAPER CRITICS! While they do bring up good points, I think they saw the movie as something different then what it was supposed to be. Just see it for yourself. Im glad I did.<br/><br/>(P.S. If you go into this movie expecting as much from the story as you do from the action, the movie will become 5 times better. And, If its watched right, a couple theories will be forming into your head that could, possibly, rival the theories that form when watching Inception. Don't believe me? Go see it.)"

A definitely enjoyable movie to watch. the story in short is that of a young girl whom her mom dies early on, and she is sent to a mental institution, and it seems dark matters are taking place, she makes new friends quickly and decides to find a plan out.<br/><br/>A simple story that Snyder managed to execute it with style. the editing stood out for me, there was a balanced mixture of music, action, special effects and sound effects here. and then there was the color gradient for the action sequences that gave a surreal feel to it. Im crazy about stop-motion action like the one from 300, so I loved seeing a lot of that here, the action was something like that of a video game or Animation. again, more mixing of fast paced action with slow motion sequences which was an adrenaline pumping experience.<br/><br/>I was also impressed with the girls casted here, the lead role was played by a young actress that i have never known before, but she did an awesome job, and her fine facial features were perfect for the role, she looked innocent yet ready to kick ass. the rest of the cast were also pretty decent and good.<br/><br/>even the art design, the fashion design and the CGI were top notch and looked so professional and real. the way the girls dressed during the action sequences were unique and the weapons they used were really awesome.<br/><br/>So this was a really enjoyable movie for me, phenomenal in every way, however it felt a little short from becoming a masterpiece. and the reason is, the PG-13 rating. During the action scenes, i felt something was missing, and then i noticed it was missing blood splatter. Im not big fan of gore, but just adding a little blood splatter or organ dismemberment would have added more to this in my opinion. Another problem was, during the action scenes the took place in the dream like world, while it was amazing, it lacked intensity and depth. and they probably should have worked on the story more to make the transition to the dream world more realistic and hence more intensity, depth and care for the girls as they fought their way through. it was a bit too simple.<br/><br/>In the end though, I thought this was a successful movie, original and a visual treat combined with a decent story done with style. I won't be surprised if this gets an Oscar nomination in the technical categories like Art design or Sound effects. go see it !"
"moviefreak2010","7","6","15","26 March 2011"," Sucker Punch packs a lot of punches
","Zack Snyder, the director 300 and Watchmen, has been finally given a chance to do a film based on his original creation. When I first heard of the movie, I knew this will be something special. It would be both a beautiful looking film and an insane thrilling ride.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to sum up what the entire film is in a nutshell but I can say this. This film is the collection of all of Snyder's films put into one. The visual look of Watchmen, his female warrior version of 300 (minus 295 of them), the slow motion technique in all of his movie and finally topping it all off with his own creative world.<br/><br/>This is the first film I seen in theaters in a long time but I can simply say that while Sucker Punch may not be the best film of the year or the greatest movie ever made but it will be on my best film of the year list.<br/><br/>Author's Note: I gave this film a 10/10. To be honest, I don't rate a movies with a 10 because its too high of a number to rate a movie. So if I had to rate Sucker Punch out of 4 stars, I give it 3 and a half stars."
"Sharkey360","8","8","22","25 March 2011"," I like Sucker Punch!
","After more than a year of waiting, I finally got to watch Sucker Punch and I must say that it definitely is worth the wait.<br/><br/>The film is not perfect and obviously there is more style than substance in it. The good thing, however, is that Sucker Punch as a story is pretty much driven by its characters and the performance of their players (kudos to Emily Browning, Oscar Isaac and others) followed closely by the high energy action sequences laced with Zack Snyder's style.<br/><br/>From a distance, Sucker Punch looks dumb and hollow but in reality it's got some nice stuff in it. For one thing its presentation took inspiration from comic books, video games, anime and fantasy adventures (mixed with a distorted sense of time), mixed them all in a bag and made the story's core concept of the struggle for freedom a enjoyable ride.<br/><br/>The film obviously won't win any awards for acting, but this one still has a strong sense of drama which will remind you that the characters are not paperdolls-for-the-screen but rather believable human beings.<br/><br/>With its energetic style, high production values, solid cast and edginess, I find Sucker Punch to be the best women-led action film to date. It's almost like it grabbed Charlie's Angels, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, So Close and DOA: Dead or Alive by their necks and threw them out the window big time.<br/><br/>While it is the queen of women-led action flicks, I don't expect Sucker Punch to win the approval of those who have no little-to-no-interest in the action, fantasy or adventure genres.<br/><br/>It is flawed and may not be the cup of tea for many, but I declare Sucker Punch a very solid film to watch if you're open to its concept, performances and style. It also has some new stuff that are worth paying attention to."

","This movie was, in my opinion, too confusing. At first, everything seems to make sense, the stepfather is trying to kill the children to get the money. But within 2 minutes, things start to get weird. First off, Baby Doll hits the light bulb with the gun, which is hanging from the ceiling, but yet her sister is still hit, appearing to be about 4 foot tall. What's even worse, it hits her waist! As well, the movie spends too much time in the fantasy acid trip harem whatever you call it, and not enough time in the 'real world'. It became too hard to determine what was actually happening. And then the ending was a cop-out. They just said, ""Oh yeah, this girl is not the main character, the other one is."" My only compliment is that the fight scenes are awesome!"

","I didn't like anything at all about this movie. Especially the music, which is all a lot of ""tribute"" artists. It seems like to me it is just a little boy's fantasy that would remind you of some juvenile video game.<br/><br/>When Baby Doll was asked to dance, she didn't really dance. She only had a daydream, and the movie is projecting what she is thinking. The only movie that could pull that off that I have seen is the musical ""Chicago"".<br/><br/>This movie is the prime example of how special effects have ruined today's movies. Special effects like these only belong in movies that actually have a somewhat decent plot, which this one does not have.<br/><br/>I was totally disappointed with the way this movie is presented."

Anyone nowadays can day dream this was just a bad idea but mostly guys went to see it cause it had hot girls in short mini skirt and school girl uniforms and girls undressing in lingerie too. I know girls wouldn't go see it unless they were into stuff like that or their went cause their boyfriends wanted to see it as well.

","This has to be one of the best films of all time. It is highly original and certainly nothing I have seen before. The action sequences are incredibly stylish and exhilarating with extremely well done special effects. The girls are gorgeous and dressed very sexily. It almost has a Japanese feel to it. I was expecting something pretty simple to follow but actually struggled to really understand what was going on. It was only by doing some research that I understood what it was about. That didn't spoil my enjoyment though of this amazing film. As for the predictable bad reviews I can only say what kind of film were you expecting? You must have seen the trailers and promo photos.

"Ryan_MYeah","2","5","12","18 April 2011"," Sucker Punch = Frontrunner for worst movie of the year.
","Well, April is often known as the time of year in film where truly great movies finally start to appear into the mainstream... so it's only ironic that I should be dragged along to the claptrap March release that is Sucker Punch.<br/><br/>The film centers on BabyDoll (Played by Emily Browning), a girl who is framed for murder by her evil stepfather, and sent to an insane asylum to be lobotomized in a matter of five days. She concocts a plan with four other inmates (Played by Jamie Chung, Abbie Cornish, Vanessa Hudgens and Jena Malone) to find five items to help them escape through the asylum's dance underworld, and imaginary worlds so anachronistic and ridiculous in explanation, you'd swear I was shouting deleted paragraphs from The Divine Comedy.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Zack Snyder, the man best known for mediocre action films such as Watchmen and 300, he also co-wrote it with a friend of his named Steve Shibuya. The film is an obvious ploy to objectify women masked by half hearted empowerment submorals, but I was hoping the film could be as interesting as it's somewhat clever five minute opening... but, to bring up Dante again, Abandon hope, all ye who enter here. I like to watch whole movies before passing unfair final judgment on them, but had I known what I know now, I would have walked out after 35 minutes.<br/><br/>It's easy enough to blame awkward pacing, and a nonsensically sloppy screenplay, but what's most disappointing is the performances. The film has a talented collection of attractive twenty-somethings performing as its five main characters, but they all can't get past being unexpressive robots, except for Jena Malone, who plays Rocket, the only character in the film I even cared about. It also wastes the older talent, such as Carla Gugino speaking in an inconsistent Polish accent as Madam Gorski, and Scott Glenn as the Wiseman, the wisest filler character to ever grace the silver screen.<br/><br/>Even the technical standpoints are lacking. Snyder's signature ultra slow motion shots grow from tedious to unbearable halfway through the film, the sound mix and design is overly bombarding, and even the visual work on the creatures and environments in the imagination sequences are garish, sub par exercises in effects animation.<br/><br/>With a final rating of * out of ****, Sucker Punch is the current frontrunner for worst movie of the year."
"haris_manda","1","5","12","15 April 2011"," This super-punching sucks
","I've never, but never, wrote review to put down some movie, but I have to do with this one. First, beginning of the movie. I was like, oh my God w** - music was epic fail, scenes were barely bearable ... I don't know. Whoever gave an idea for this beginning, I suggest him to jump off bridge or something. <br/><br/>Second, acting. Oh my, oh my ... I've seen better acting at amateur theater with kids of age 8 acting ... There was no willingness in their acting, it's just plain and stupid, no offense. It's like putting Barbie into hell and watching her escaping ... pinky boring. <br/><br/>Then, plot. Honestly, I was a bit confused with all that alter-reality because I'm a guy of one world, not tons of them. However, I handled that somehow, and continued watching. Oh my, oh my ... how much I regret. <br/><br/>She enters some sort of Japan-style temple or tomb or whatever and meets some wired guy who gives her gun and samurai sword and tells her to find out her freedom. Then she returns to reality, suddenly starting to speak much more and being more friendly. Then there pops out idea about escaping : finding a map, setting whole place on fire, finding a knife and a key ... Oh my, oh my ... <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I'm not feminist and I don't hate movies with girls fighting for something they believe in - but this is lame. I haven't even cared for a girl ... I did not cared if she was raped, if she was sent there without a crime; I do not care, it's just plain. <br/><br/>Then I kind a stooped watching movie and turned on music on my earphone. It was real pain in the a** watching almost 2hrs of nothing but suffering for my ears, eyes and my entire body. This movie brings nothing new, it just waste 2hrs of your life. <br/><br/>At the end, some short version :<br/><br/>+ I liked big guy with machine gun. - Everything else. <br/><br/>Friendly advice : Stay away from this movie !"
"pax_terminus","10","5","12","3 April 2011"," What would you do if you had 5 days to live and no way out?
","Here is the problem with the Sucker Punch. It is a very complicated psychological drama using symbolism that, at least in the in Western culture, is not commonly used to express one's internal anguish and mind's ways to cope with unimaginable terrors of reality. <br/><br/>Even though I thought I had a pretty good understanding of the story, a few reviews here on IMDb proved me wrong, I still missed a lot. <br/><br/>The movie happens on 3 levels of reality. The actual Real Life story of the movie is horribly sad and violent and all its full horrors are mercifully not obvious until the very end of the movie. <br/><br/>Baby Doll kills her sister by accident while trying to protect her from an abusive stepfather. Oh, the cruel irony She gets committed to an insane asylum, where the stepfather arranges for her to be lobotomized, i.e. effectively murdered - turned into a veggie. She has 5 days to try and save herself. Now, she is not the narrator of the story. It is Sweat Peas who tells us the story. I think now that the first layer of allegory is the projection of Sweat Pea's mind. It is a dance club / luxury brothel; however a lot of shots of that reality clearly use the insane asylum setting. Took me some time to realize that this projection is what it is because the girls are being sexually abused by the orderlies, behind doctor Gorsky's back. Of course I am only about 75% sure of that, really In any case, the items the girls have to obtain are real, and the dangers are real. The Baby Doll's dance sequences are a third layer of reality allegory and they represent her way of dealing with reality. They both express her emotions and what is actually happening in the real world/first allegory while girls work on getting items. <br/><br/>The symbolism used here is targets a very narrow group of people, namely 30-40 yrs old folks who spent a lot of time playing the computer and video games of the 90ties. That or experts on Japanese Manga <br/><br/>The visuals of the epic struggle scenes are amazing, I am still not entirely clear about the real-world link to the 3 Fighting Samurai Statues is. The other scenes were a little bit clearer to me. <br/><br/>I still cannot get over the fact that Baby Doll got eventually lobotomized, but unfortunately this is not your usual happy end story. This movie reminds me a lot about stories of people in the Nazi Concentration Camps and how they mentally dealt with the complete lack of control over their lives and daily inhumane, mind-bending horrors. All in all it is beautifully crafted, but a sad and very dark story."
"mbackschat","9","5","12","1 April 2011"," Great movie with surprisingly clever, well-thought out and satisfying story
","On first look this movie might appear as stylized, loud and action-driven. But this is only one side of this movie. After giving it much thought and having talked with friends, the movie's story revealed itself as clever, well-thought out and very satisfying. Here's my interpretation:<br/><br/>The essential twist consists in the fact that the fantasy worlds (brothel/fighting scenes) are imagined not by Baby Doll, but by Sweet Pea. This is a variation of the ""unreliable narrative"" which is in fashion nowadays.<br/><br/>Snyder reveals the resolution to us with the very first lines: ""Everyone has an angel..."" When Sweet Pea sees Baby Doll for the first time in the big hall of the institution, she decides to make Baby Doll her personal ""angel"": just pay attention to Sweet Pea's look over to Baby Doll and her appearance as a bearing angel with her blonde hair. For this reason, in the first scene in the brothel, Sweet Pea looks like ""her angel"" with her blond wig and she even says that she is the star of this ""show""; after all, she has created this world and not Baby Doll, and she lets her fight for/along with herself.<br/><br/>After Baby Doll gives herself up at the end to the suitors gathered before the brothel and deflects them, Sweet Pea succeeds in escaping to the outside gate of the brothel - but also in reality; and there she has used Baby Doll's lobotomy as a diversion. It is furthermore revealed that the abstraction of items in the imaginations (brothel/fighting scenes) is reflected in the reality.<br/><br/>Why does the boy as well as the old man appear in the final scene? You can answer this in several ways: <br/><br/>1. Sweet Pea's reality is unreliable, as mentioned above, thus, one can credit her with mixing the impressions of her imagination with reality (the bus driver possibly looks like the Wise Man because she understands him as a guide/aide - and for her, the archetypical guide/aide's figure looks this way)<br/><br/>2. No dream is merely a dream: at a more metaphoric level, hope is given that our most inner thoughts can also affect the outermost reality - and with it, our imagination potential is encouraged - what is also pronounced explicitly within the final monologue: ""... YOU!"""

I think the story is really good. They need to escape and use their imagination to help and guide them. The fight scenes are the best that snyder has done, well at least to me. The movie is full of epic nerdy scenes that will make any young guy that plays video games very happy. I like the way they present the Asylum as a sort of whore house/dance house and the story goes from there. It's very stylish, very epic and pleases you when you see the credits roll. And the quote from the movie and trailer is awesome,""If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything""."

The characters are strange and stupid. Emily Browning seems to have taken endorsements of make-up kits. Stupid script. average direction (Zack Snyder) (most of it is cgi.. like 300, but visually not so appealing), horrible acting, but the soundtrack, awesome. the direction was kinda like watchmen.. the style which seems to be his trademark..

","If the filmography of Robert Rodriguez were projected onto the wall of Plato's cave, the fever dreams of its sorry inhabitants might come out something like this. ""Sucker Punch"" is an asylum for every unoriginal impulse that strikes director Zack Snyder's attention deficient mind. It is an unmitigated disaster of storytelling—thematically diarrheic with visuals to match. This hopeless post-""Inception"" melodrama isn't based on a comic book like either of Snyder's previous efforts, but every genre cliché carries over tenfold.<br/><br/>Like a pockmarked teen with an anime fetish, Snyder's convoluted revenge flick plays out with a cast of buxom babes who look as though they might bleed mascara when cut. Stuffed into absurdly tight-fitting outfits, gals with names like Rocket, Baby Doll, and Sweet Pea unload thousands of shells from their semi-automatic rifles and leap columns of flames in when- exactly-was-this-cool-again slow motion.<br/><br/>The tiered fantasy worlds of ""Sucker Punch"" might be exciting if they corresponded in any way to the next reality over. Probably the most asinine aspect of Snyder and Steve Shibuya's screenplay (I say probably because competition is steep) is that while our protagonist is fighting a 20-foot tall sourpussed samurai or fleeing a castle from an apoplectic dragon, we are meant to believe she is really—how should I put this—doing a sexy dance. A major structural component of ""Sucker Punch"" is Baby Doll's escape from incarceration, a feat that necessitates trinkets such as a map, knife, lighter, and key, all of which are obtained by distracting their male overlords with exotic dancing.<br/><br/>For every item on the checklist, Baby Doll gyrates—though while she cuts loose, she imagines she is annihilating clockwork Nazi soldiers in the trenches of a steampunk World War II, or tearing apart an android army on a futuristic bomb-strapped bullet train. The latter is set to a cover of the Beatles' ""Tomorrow Never Knows,"" in which John Lennon once sang, ""Turn off your mind"" and ""Lay down all thought."" Snyder seems to have appropriated that message quite literally.<br/><br/>The bigger problem is that Snyder throws dramatic tension out the window by creating a fantasy world where nothing is at stake. The laws of these alternate realities are unclear at best, and the sequences themselves are purely masturbatory given that whatever happens is only loosely tied to the story we're supposed to be following. I might be more forgiving of that conceit if Snyder really wowed, but ""Sucker Punch"" doesn't bring a single idea to the table that hasn't been done to death in movies or video games. Snyder does so much recycling that he ought to receive special commendation from Greenpeace.<br/><br/>It's equally hard to muster up sympathy for his characters outside of their imaginary adventures. Snyder has a bad habit of using trauma as a binding agent between them and the audience; other than that Baby Doll fell under the shadow of an evil foster-father before imprisonment, there isn't a single reason why we should care about her. She is as devoid of genuine personality as the rest of the cartoon cast.<br/><br/>""Sucker Punch"" might have been a blast if the tone was more in line with ""Scott Pilgrim"" or even ""Kill Bill."" Gratuitous action can be fun—just don't ask me to take it seriously. The worst of Snyder's misconceptions is that he can simultaneously blow **** up and pull our heartstrings. That he directs schlock under the pretense of style is laid bare in this, his first original work. ""Sucker Punch"" is not only brain dead, it's contagiously stupid. It's a high school sophomore's juvenile doodles on an 82 million dollar budget. If Snyder's filmography were projected on the wall of Plato's cave, I think those poor bastards would welcome the first disorienting rays of sunlight and their freedom with open arms."
"utpal_das","2","5","12","28 March 2011"," Don't expect too much OR I probably didn't get it
","I did because it came not from the director of 300, but from the director who gave us Watchmen. 300 was a visual delight and something radically new for its time. Watchmen was a different genre altogether, one of those rare movies which cannot be probably clubbed in any genre.<br/><br/>I went out thinking if Watchmen was something like 10 steps ahead of 300, then Sucker Punch would be really a new dimension. That thinking cost me. Yes, the visuals were spectacular, but all of them were in dream sequence,having no relativity to the original story. Yes, you can have artistic liberty, but then it should be like ""Inception"" where every scene, every detail is tagged to the story.<br/><br/>There was no twist, no suspense, nothing really 'unfolds'. The story is as predictable as it can be. Not much of a story anyway, just a abused girl trying to make her way out of a mental asylum where she has been put by her step father. Yes, thats it. And probably about 30 minutes of the entire movie is towards that. Rest of it, you could very well deduct and the 'movie' would still be there. Of course the only things missing would be what you would go for at the first place - the visuals.<br/><br/>Amazing visuals, mind blowing, it takes you out of the world at times, almost like a 6 or 7/ 10 compared to Avatar, but this is 2D. So really really spectacular. Cannot imagine any movie in 2D showing visuals this brilliant. <br/><br/>There is a message in the movie which was either too simple, (that is, it is you who write your own destiny) or I probably didn't get it. I mean the reason I liked Watchmen was for its message that sometimes it takes a lie to make amends, peace based on a lie because of the greater good. And when you get the message, you recall the film backward and if there were any questions you had, you get the answers and that gives you your money worth. That part was as I said either missing or I didn't get it.<br/><br/>Try ignoring the story and the screen play and you will enjoy it more. There was not a lot for acting scale and all the actors played to the roles.Overall, go with an open mind without any perception or prejudice and you will enjoy the sheer glamour the movie has. Its brutally fantastic. I gave it a 5 for the visual delights, its just that when you go for a movie, you want it to your heart's content. It didn't satisfy me at all and thereby I could at most give it a 5."

""The Fifth Element."" (1997)<br/><br/>It is You. ^_^ Or at least UP to You. =3<br/><br/>For those simply seeing ""Sexy School Girls,"" ""Dancing Temptresses"" and ""Battle-Babe-Female-Fatales"" in this fabulous flick are sincerely victim of this film's title TOTALLY...

The protagonist, we simply know as ""Baby"" truly to me is well portrayed as are her thoughts as a ""Living Fantasy."" It is made clear early on that what we are going to see is the ""Feelings"" of our protagonist shared through her ""Series of Worlds"" which will take on forms that in my humble opinion the modern ""Digital Native"" or ""Millennium/Dotcom"" should be able to relate. man and woman. <br/><br/>(Certainly a film that is homage to the ""Rumiko Takahashi"" ""Stan Lee"" ""J.K. Rowling"" ""J.R. Tolkien"" ""Walt Disney,"" ""Spike + Stan Lee"" types of our world. I personally and instantly thought, ""This is Baby's version of my Angel Arc Universe."" ^_^)<br/><br/>Indeed even though there are those in the crowd of existence who may view this movie and wonder ""where is this GOING!?"" or even as one young lady put it after completing this film, 'So it's like 90 percent of the movie didn't even happen."" Such shallow views will indeed keep one from drawing in the full and soul-enriching message of this film. The world is essentially what we make it. <br/><br/>Although a far cry from being even remotely as humorous or upbeat and lighthearted as the awesome Mike Judge film and story shared in The Invention of Lying (2009) or as sci-fi of similes a James Cameron's Avatar (2009) -- Snyder's & Shibuya's Sucker Punch answers a potential reason to do, shape, create, craft or share anything: <br/><br/>Love.<br/><br/>The Jesus Christ Superstar (1973) style of character does seem to get a great deal of ""Story Play"" in our world it would seem. From Joan of Arc (1999) to Socrates (1971) to Gandhi (1982) to Martin Luther King, Jr. (1929-1968) and John F. Kennedy (1917-1963) this side of Reality. <br/><br/>From ""Earth-Saving-Mecha-Pilots Takaya and Amano"" in the Hideki Anno anime Aim For The Top! Gunbuster to ""Human-Eating-Monster-Fighter-and-Driver Francis Lawrence in I Am Legend (2007) to ""Space-Traveling-Daddy Harry Stamper"" in the film Armageddon (1998)... there just seems to be a magnetic attraction to those who are capable of caring beyond the self for a larger cause. <br/><br/>This film's theme ends no different. And although there are those who may dislike the closing ""Progressive End"" made from a decision of ""Love In The Purest Form"" (honest platonic care about a ""Purpose"" which includes a scope and understanding beyond the self) -- to me... there certainly is no less a fitting end to such a tragic story. Essentially -- the end is fitting. <br/><br/>Things get better. Things get worse. Things balance out. Things fall out of balance (towards positive or negative). Things return to balance and change... remains the only true constant or ""same.""<br/><br/>Indeed how such change affects each individual is up to the individual.

","I saw the movie at the theater last night, and.... wow. This film is truly unique. The story is difficult to talk about with out spoiling anything, but i will do my best. Our Protagonist is a young girl who finds her self put into an insane asylum by her abusive stepfather so that he may be rid of her. From there its all surprises. The main characters find themselves in a variety of situations and hostile worlds. The protagonists get their first taste of battle when they find themselves in the trenches of World War 1. Except things aren't quite the same as they were in the history books. The Germans turn out to be cyborg like figures, brought back from the dead by the genius of German engineering. What do our heroes on screen do about this alternative history situation? Kill as many of them possible. This is just one example of the insanity and epic madness of the film. Any fan of Snyder's past work or action fans are in for quite a treat."
"louis_lux","6","5","12","25 March 2011"," Exactly what the trailers promised
","If you thought the trailer and plot summary seemed silly then by all means listen to the critics and don't go see it, but if you were excited by the trailers and thought the story might be interesting then I advise you to go see it.<br/><br/>The first and third trailer and part of the second were not your average trailer, they had barely any dialog and you basically got that sick action to the sound of some wicked music. That's exactly what's in the movie, and frankly talking would just have ruined it, the action and music are all you need.<br/><br/>From the trailer we can tell that Scott Glenn says the cheesiest lines and it's so cheesy compared to the other characters that there's just no way it's not intentional, but he actually does it quite well, the guys in the Expendables movie wish they could say cheesy lines so well.<br/><br/>Like I said, the other actors are nothing like Scott Glenn's character, who resides in the imaginary, they are all flesh and blood and have deep emotions. The middle section of the movie is quite intense and I dare anyone to say anything bad about Oscar Isaac's performance, he was great throughout. The girls are very good too and honestly made some action stars look bad in comparison.<br/><br/>Now I really have to mention again that the middle portion of the movie, that takes place in the train with the robots and what follows, is the highlight of the movie, if the rest of the movie had matched that part critics would be seeing the movie in a much more positive light. It features the best action, the stakes at hand are tangible and an already intense scene gets even more intense when Blue lays down the law, again incredible performance by Oscar Isaac."

","While the trailer for this movie emphasizes a similarity to the action female performances of Charlie's Angels and includes computer-generated imagery to attract fans of fast paced action scenes, the movie itself goes into a deeper story line, brilliantly illustrating a key message of Buddhist philosophy. Unfortunately the appreciation of this message is likely to lost on the majority of audiences.<br/><br/>We begin with the main character, Baby Doll, who as a child looses everything she knew and loved, and is thrust into a harsh reality that effects so many abused children. She is forced to live with a step-father who we are led to realize treats her as a sex toy. This is not illustrated graphically, but rather by having the camera focus on the button of her clothing being thrust onto the floor.<br/><br/>Having decided to take a stand against her abuser, Baby Doll grabs a gun to shoot her step father. Unfortunately, as is often the case in such abusive reality, the abused is not able to finish the act and is instead further punished. Indeed, Baby Doll is not strong enough to stand up for herself, a point that is dealt with later.<br/><br/>Unable to control Baby Doll, the step father takes the child to the Lennox House for the mentally insane in Brattleboro, Vermont. The perceived reality of such institutions abusing their clients is brought to life in this film, where the patients are inducted into a life of bringing pleasures to high paying clients.<br/><br/>Realizing that this is not the reality she wishes to continue, Baby Doll is able to transfer herself to a sub reality in which she is given instructions on how she can alter her reality. Here begins her search for five items: map, fire , knife, key, the fifth item being a mystery. She is told to begin her journey, and reminded that it will set her free. While the user of the five items is instrumental to setting her free, it is the the fifth item which brings a powerful message to this movie.<br/><br/>For each of the items, the film transfers us to a dream world in which CGI is used to create an action packed scenes. While these dream worlds clearly illustrate Baby Dolls transformation from an individual who finds themselves to be helpless to one full of confidence, they could have just as easily been left out of the film. The serve only to attract audiences to the film.<br/><br/>In the end we find that Baby Doll is able to change herself, and in so doing changes her reality. The only question that remains is what reality will Baby Doll choose for herself. As the Buddhist's philosophy goes, only through deep insight can we truly change our reality to ensure happiness for ourselves and those we love.<br/><br/>The film answers the question of which reality Baby Doll will choose in the end, and does so brilliantly. I was extremely hesitant to view this movie based on my distaste for CGI action packed movies. True to my distaste I found the scenes to be rather mundane, fortunately they only took up about 20 minutes of the film. The ability of the director to end the film as he did makes this movie worth watching."

","I'm just going to start out by saying I liked Sucker Punch a lot, but I think I'm probably going to be in the minority on that case. This movie is definitely a love-it or hate-it movie.<br/><br/>This movie is NOT a deep or intellectual movie by any means, but it does have a complex plot and while I found it easy to understand, other people might not or if the they do understand it, might not see the point of it, so there's one black mark against it. Also, it just not a serious movie, which I think a lot of people will expect it to be.<br/><br/>I enjoyed all the actor's performances, but the only one I feel gave it her all without going overboard was Abbie Cornish. Emily Browning and Jena Malone were both good but I feel they probably could have done better, which is a shame since Emily was really the reason I saw this movie. I've never seen Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung in anything, and I really feel there wasn't much to their characters to begin with, so it's hard to judge if they were good or not. And I feel both Oscar Isaac and Carla Guigno were overacting in their respective roles.<br/><br/>Now, I don't really like action movies, so I don't really know how to judge the action sequences. I liked them, but I've seen other reviews saying they were too short. The CGI was good and I think almost everyone will agree that at the very least it's a pretty movie.<br/><br/>In the end, I think whether or not someone will enjoy Sucker Punch depends on why you're going to see it. If you want a movie with meaning or that takes itself seriously, or if you're going solely for mindless action, then you aren't going to enjoy this. If you go in thinking this movie will suck, nothing about it will change your mind. BUT if you're looking for a good movie to solely entertain you for two hours, then I would recommend you give this a shot."

","SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>SUCKER PUNCH - aptly named when you realize writer/director Zak Snyder suckered you into paying $15 based on an epic trailer made entirely of THINGS A CHARACTER DREAMS IN THE MOVIE. <br/><br/>This is an incredible innovation scamming movie goers. Why doesn't everyone who doesn't have a compelling screenplay have their main character dream 2 minutes of unconnected, cool looking action that doesn't actually happen in the story line, then make a trailer out of it? Batman v. Superman had the same crap trick (Batman desert fight scene) but to a lesser extent. At least Michael Bay makes an attempt at cramming the incoherent action from the trailer into the story.<br/><br/>Can't wait for Notebook 2, wherein the main character has an epic 2 minute dream styled after BladeRunner vs. Citizen Kane vs. The Color Purple that ends of being 100% of the trailer, having nothing to do with the 98% of the movie about a stationary store."
"cam357","10","4","9","9 May 2014"," Phenomenal, great lesson for the masses
","Sucker Punch is NOT about cinema, it's not trying to be meta, and it's certainly not about the flashy graphics and excessive effects. Sucker Punch is an attempt to reach the audience in a way movies usually can't. It shows simply that each of us suffer our own asylums, but not many are as rambunctious as the character Baby Doll. Looking at it as it is, a movie, it certainly has its cons. But it's not just a movie, it's a lesson, one to be taught to everyone. Too many people just sit around complaining about their lives, about how crappy their situation is. And more than likely they're right. Sucker Punch is a movement to try and get the audience off their a**es and fight for what they want: freedom. If you can't see the movie as more than just flashy lights and good effects then you're wasting your time. Get off your a** and go do something with your life, something you've wanted to do for a long time. Free yourself."

The cinematography was absolutely beautiful. The soundtrack amazing. And Emily Browning's character, Baby Doll, was nothing short of hypnotic.<br/><br/>Even though I'm sure it wasn't intended, I felt true emotion with Emily's character throughout the movie. I was angered, saddened, and exhilarated right along with her.<br/><br/>In fact, even on my third viewing of the film, each several months apart, I found myself so angered at the treatment of Baby Doll that I had literal tears flowing.

"ironhorse_iv","5","4","9","30 November 2012"," Sucker punch to the head: headache
","That's how it felt watching this Zack Snyder's movie. It opens up with a 20 year old 'Baby Doll' (Emily Browning), whom mother just die. She's forced to live with her stepfather, despite her being of legal age to live on her own even in 1960's society. In a 1980's pop grudge music video style montage, the audience sees that her stepfather try to rape & she is blamed for the death of her younger sister when she misfired the gun & the bullet struck the younger sister. Unlike Zack Snyder's previous film, the music does not fit the film at all. It's doesn't match the time settling, It's go in and out of pop, rap & heavy metal. She's institutionalized in an asylum by him, once again despite being legal age. The stepfather bribes orderlies Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), into forging the signature of the psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Baby Doll lobotomized so she cannot inform the cops of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. Baby Doll wants four items, map, fire, knife, & key that she would need to attempt an escape. This is where the film does go into off the wall fantasy world with somewhat truth to it. This mental asylum is a monarch mind control experiment site. They systematically repeated the sexual abuse for wellness. They used music to encourage them to dissociate from reality by dancing. By dancing, she escapes the most humiliating aspect of her private hell, being made to dance for the pleasure of others, symbolic of sexual abuse. She does this by turning that experience around, instead of it being about surrender & humiliation, she makes it about fighting & survival, but what doesn't make sense is the dream world, she creates. How these imagination introduces in the story, background, or character development. She dreams of feudal Japan with giant samurais, WW1 trench warfare with German zombies, flying in a WW2 Bomber chasing down a dragon, & last a futuristic train ride with robots. Where in the story are these outlandish ideas of her introduces or comes from? She didn't show any interest in anime, video game, & steam punk. Those genres didn't really become well known at the time. It is nonsensical action scenes with no depth. It only somewhat mirrored her real life. The only dream that kind of does make any sense is that she thinks she's in brothel and her virginity is sold to the 'High Roller' AKA lobotomy doctor (Jon Hamm). She befriends four others – Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), & Rocket's sister, Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) convincing to escape with her. Why is she, all of a sudden a prostitute might be explain by what was truly happening in their ordeals in the hospital that are manifested as enemies in the dreams. It is here in the dreams, she meet the Wise Man (Scott Glenn). He revealed a fifth item is needed for ""a deep sacrifice'. The ""Wise man"", might be another aspect of her personality, doling out cod philosophy & warnings. What hurts the film is in the beginning, the audience sees that Baby Doll doesn't escape her lobotomy thus we enter the brothel reality with Sweet Pea playing Baby Doll. In my opinion, all the characters represent different aspects of Sweet Pea & the whole film takes place in Pea's head. The movie does start with Sweet Pea narrating & Baby Doll does say to Pea ""this is your story"". Baby Doll is just a character that Sweet Pea created to be strong enough to escape, the person who puts all the actions of the story into motion. Pea's sister Rocket dies in somewhat the same way as Baby Doll with her sister. Many critics say the girls aren't empowered in any way because they are constantly in danger of being raped. While they are victimized, the movie shows how they still fight back with incredible strength, & they have to in order to escape their harsh lives. Baby Doll's arrival makes the rest of the characters realize that they have to look within themselves to find the courage to battle depression. My own interpretation is that the film is a tale of someone with multiple personality disorder fighting her way back to sanity. The initial sequence shows Baby doll helping the child defy her abusive father, this results in that classic punishment of abused children, being locked in a closet. The child dies in that closet to that represents the death of the Sweet Pea's sanity & innocence. Note toward the end, Blue has Pea locked in a closet. When her courage, Baby doll is almost lost – the lobotomy, she escapes in that last instant, to another world, the bordello. In sense, the men that sexual abuse can't dominate her, or make her feel him, which makes him go crazy in his own sexual frustration and dejection. She's basically laughing at him. The sexy schoolgirl outfits might represent both her lost innocence and the perverse demands of men. If the films show the exploitation and sexism without condoning it they would not need to have the actresses act sexually appealing, styled sexually provocative & have the movie filmed in such a highly sexually focused way. The really interesting thing about the movie to me is that they are saying that sexually objectifying and exploiting women is wrong while sexualizing exploiting and objectifying this female actresses. It's like they can't see it themselves. Whatever, the actual story might be, this film is confusing to the points, it's provokes headache. If look as not a smart movie; the movie seems to be for dumb teenagers with scenes with awful acting sexy girls in skimpy uniforms with overused CGI visuals. The men in the film are portrayal as rapists isn't greatly like. The film is pure sexual violence for entertainment. Modern way of Ludus Magna and Panem et Circenses."
"kaitilie","2","4","9","25 July 2012"," Bass-heavy music and slow-mo scenes do not a movie make
","It's like Inception and Kill Bill got drunk and had a three way with Pan's Labyrinth and this is their awful hangover. Jena Malone must have been sucker punched into doing this because she's normally in rockin movies. I'm all for fantasy and sci fi, and even the occasional comic book/graphic novel adaptation, but this was beyond ridiculous. It starts off interesting enough, but quickly turns to trash as the plot loses all focus and simply becomes a teenage boy's wet dream of legs, boobs, and slow mo fight scenes. Baby Doll (seriously?) gets locked away in an asylum by her stepdad who makes a deal with the doc to lobotomize her in five days. Interesting enough. To mentally escape her horrific situation, BD fantasizes that she's forced into this ""orphanage"" burlesque/brothel.(Because that's so much more soothing.) There she has to dance. You never see her dance, but from what I gather from the other character's reactions, it must be like looking into the face of god or something because they're all totally hypnotized. Instead of seeing her dance, she once again fantasizes and is taken into some alternate CGI universe. There she meets her sensei who spouts clichés every time you see him, and tells her she has to collect a bunch of items to attain her freedom. So she and her mental patient/stripper gal pals slow-mo CGI battle giant samurai, nazi zombis, dragons and robots whilst on their scavenger hunt for freedom. I won't go into too much detail (it's honestly not worth the time to type it as it is to watch it), but the gal pals get knocked off as they go. All except Sweet Pea (seriously?!?) who took the entire movie to warm up to BD, naturally. So BD and SP finally hit it off and BD realizes she was the fifth ""mystery"" object and sacrifices herself for SP's freedom. BD gets lobotomized, doc gets arrested for malpractice, and sensei (now a bus driver) hauls SP to freedom."

"arthur_nonimus","10","4","9","9 April 2011"," An artist uses lies to tell the truth...
","...as one of the characters from 'V for Vendetta' puts it. Sucker Punch certainly uses lies, trickery and deceit - it manipulates you while giving you everything you need in advance.<br/><br/>A young woman is sent to an asylum by her step father who wants her out of the way. Scheduled for a lobotomy that will keep her secrets locked away forever she dreams of escape. She as well as a few of the inmates plan their escape - collecting items that they will need along the way. But there is one problem, how do you survive until you can make your escape? Where can you run? When there are bars on the windows and the doors are locked, when the guards are sadists and the system is against you there is still a way out. The mind, where anything is possible and everything is probable.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder takes us on a journey through not only an escape from brutal injustice but also the inner workings of the mind. When she is locked away and her stepfather pays for her to be lobotomised illegally, she retreats into her mind. Into another world which makes more sense, one which she can fight her way out of! What follows is a battle of the minds. While in the real world she may be involved in any number of unpleasant things in her mind she is fighting an epic battle between good and evil. And so with the energy drawn from her fantasy she pushed ever closer to her freedom.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are some of the best I have yet seen in any movie. What bothers me about most movie fight scenes where the camera is flying around more than the actors is that you lose your perception of where you (the camera) are in space. For a split second you feel like you should be on the roof or on the wall instead of in your seat. This is never a problem here, while you spin around the scene you always know where you and the camera are, like a gymnast knows where the mat is you always know where your heroes and villains are allowing you to anticipate where the next kick, punch or shot is coming from.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't seek to tax you with suspense, nor should it. When there is a death you see it coming from a mile off. But that is not what this movie is about. It's what's happening inside rather than outside that matters - she is fighting robots inside a train on another planet, in a brothel, in an asylum. Need I say more! All in all this is great movie! This is not by its nature an accessible movie, concepts in it are dark, disturbing and for anyone who has no knowledge of the workings of the mind, both healthy and not, it may be utterly boring. And while I will admit, being a guy, having girls in skimpy clothing does help to keep ones attention, this movie would be utterly fantastic without it. This movie would also be fantastic without the fight scenes also but it goes a hell of a long way towards shaping the world on screen.<br/><br/>""You are given all the weapons you need.

I'm a 37 year-old single mom, so when I saw the coming attractions I assumed I was as far from the target audience as you can get. However, I am a die-hard action movie lover (pun intended). I figured why not go see it, it looks pretty good; lots of action and females kicking butt. I have to say the plot was more involved than I expected. Creative layer, upon layer, upon layer, it was like Inception meets Girl Interrupted, graphic novel style. I am a huge critic of CGI and thought those scenes were quite impressive. They may be perceived as over the top, but I think they were representative of the inner struggles and challenges the girls were facing. They also coincided with what they were trying to accomplish or obtain at that point in the movie. As for the characters and their designated nicknames, i.e. Baby Doll, I perceived them as stereotypes that women have to overcome when they're in a demeaning or vulnerable situation, which is exactly what was being portrayed in the movie. And to top it all off, the soundtrack was ideal. This movie is a complete package; action, inner struggle, empowerment, great CGI and even a touch of emotion. I definitely recommend it!"

The action was pervasive and intense, the effects were gorgeous, and on the rare occasion that the action died down a bit, the story was intriguing enough to keep me satisfied the whole way through.

"stampsbrennan","9","4","9","3 April 2011"," Don't be a Sucker, Give it a Punch
","Let's be honest with the critics, if any of them liked a movie like this they would be fired. Unfortunately these days they give the same old repeat romantic comedy a higher rating than a masterpiece such as this. Also unfortunately, because of the bad hype, the movie isn't doing so well, which means we may not get another great cinematic adventure anytime soon. When the critics started bashing it, I was a little concerned and hesitant to see it. However, when I finally made it to the movies, I was FAR from disappointed.<br/><br/>Is this movie any good? YES. Maybe I'm biased by being a huge Zach Snyder fan, but he works his genius in this one just as he did with 300, Watchmen, and Dawn of the Dead. Okay, the screenplay is no Social Network, and there will be no Oscar nominated actors (especially after what the critics did to this movie), but that is not what Zach Snyder is all about, and that's not what made him such a breakout director in the first place. He combines absolutely amazing visual effects with Booming music (an amazing soundtrack by the way, it did so much for the movie). Having said that, the screenplay and acting aren't bad at all. Baby Doll (Emily Browning) although quiet throughout the entire movie is still very intriguing. Oscar Isaac does an amazing job with his creepy pedo mustache at being the central villain who you love to hate. As much as I loved Avatar (another visually-driven movie), it had some pretty cheesy lines in it where I had to say, ""Really?"" Sucker-punch didn't have any cheesy moments for me. There was actually quite a bit of substance in the message of the story, it just wasn't pounded into your brain as much as the amazing fight sequences.<br/><br/>A lot of people complained about how random some of the fight sequences were and how they didn't make any sense. For me, that's exactly what made it work. What other movie could possibly go from fighting over sized ninja's with Gatling guns, to undead/steam punk Nazi soldiers, to freaking Middle Earth, and finally the I-Robot Tram system. Did it make sense? No. But it made each fight sequence a totally unique and complex experience, and was such a joy to the eyes.<br/><br/>As good as it is, there are still a few things that would prevent me from giving it the full 10. Jon Hamm? The biggest named actor in the movie had 3 lines and was in less than 1 percent of the entire movie. I personally thought that was random and hope they didn't pay him very much. Also, there is an immediate transition of reality from an insane asylum to a brothel, and this is never really explained in the movie which confused me and some of my friends. Also, you tell it was reallllly hard for Snyder to slab on the PG-13 Rating for this one. However, he was able to replace the Undead-Steampunk Nazi Soldier's blood with dust for an almost equally satisfying effect. Lord knows what he COULD have done with the some of the Brothel scenes, however he played it smart. He realized that not having an R rating with -10 minutes of bloody fights would get him +$$$ with teenage boys being able to get into the theater (I would have liked the blood though heh). Other than than these few nitpicky things, this movie was thoroughly entertaining, and you need to ignore the critics and see this puppy on the big screen.<br/><br/>This movie is all in the style, music, and action. Actually, I'd say this movie had more fighting than 300. The moments without fighting were just as engrossing to me. See it, if you're disappointed then go watch The King's Speech and leave this Baby-Doll alone."
"frisco2007","10","4","9","3 April 2011"," Superb Message, Superbly Done
","It was inspiring and refreshing to see a Man (Zack Snyder) go full out in praise of Individualism. This movie's final summed up abstract message, it's theme, is the strength of the Individual. It is all about messages like Freedom, you can do it, you are good enough to get what you want to do done, you are adequate, you as an individual, you are strong, you yourself have what you need to fight your battles in Life, you are strong enough to live as an individual entity, strong enough to be. That you can watch over yourself, you are sufficient to take care of yourself, you, you as you are are strong. Subtext being you, your individual mind is strong. <br/><br/>In this day when the previews for this movie included movies about how we need other people to watch over us, and other such trash, Sucker Punch is a bold, laudatory tribute to each one of us, to the Individual, that I recommend to everybody!!!!! <br/><br/>Concretely, the story is excellent, the action sequences look great and the actresses are keel over HEROIC GORGEOUS!!!!! Enjoy!!!!!!!"

","How dare they spend money to make a comic book movie that's not based on a comic book? Or a fantasy film not tied to a popular fairy tale or book or video game or cartoon? Why do I have to get to know new characters when I could be watching another glorious reboot or sequel? Or even a prequel? Who green-lit this? (Yes, I'm well aware Snyder is doing the re-reboot of Supes next but my sarcastic rant still stands. I'm just happy to see an imaginative movie in this genre that wasn't based off of something in a 1980's Toys""R""Us store.) Look, it's a love it or hate it kind of film.<br/><br/>I get it, now. I see why it provoked that reaction. It's a double-shot of wry, with a pretty metaphor and an obvious message, putting kick-ass girls in all the traditional male roles of kick-assery. The story is framed in two levels of dreaming (you know, like Inception, the first movie EVER to have a dream within a dream), and the painterly, orgasmic action is an ode to Because-I-Can using every toy and poster found in the very finest of comic shops. From Sailor Moon to steampunk, it's all there, sans the already overdone cyberpunk.<br/><br/>It is indulgent, pseudo-feminist, and a giant finger flipped at the stodgy, rehash-happy conventions of Hollywood."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","4","9","31 March 2011"," I was the sucker here
","Long ago, I developed a quiet little ritual that I perform before I begin watching a movie. As I am settling into my seat and the studio logo rolls out and the movie slips happily to ""Fade In"", I get excited and silently say to myself ""Okay . . . tell me a story."" That's not an unreasonable request, but apparently it was a wish that the creators of Sucker Punch could not grant.<br/><br/>This is one of the dullest, most incoherent movies I've seen in many moons. The story is so convoluted that it actually took me a good 20 minutes just to unravel what was going on in the opening scenes. Then when I finally got my bearings, I found myself overloaded with a phone book worth of logical questions that I hoped and prayed that director and co-writer Zack Snyder - the man behind 300 and Watchmen (my favorite film of 2009) - would be able to answer.<br/><br/>He cannot. What we have here is a muddy-looking music video crossed with plot elements out of a video game and woven together into an odd tapestry of sexual taboos and fetishistic nonsense. Here is a movie made up of quick-cuts, regulation dialogue, pretty faces, pretty bodies and buckets of sleaze.<br/><br/>The story, once I understood it, involves a PYT known only as Baby Doll (Emily Browning). She's cute but eternally sad. That's because the opening sequence reveals that her mother died and her incestuous father locked her away in an insane asylum when she (apparently) wouldn't give in to his sexual advances. She hardly gets a look at the institution before she is strapped to a chair to receive a lobotomy. Her method of combating the procedure is to escape to a fantasy world where she is imprisoned in a brothel with four other female inmates: Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens who is a brunette despite her name), Rocket (Jena Malone) and Amber (Jamie Chung). Then, of course, there's the madame, Dr. Gorski (Carla Gugino, sporting a train wreck of a Russian accent).<br/><br/>The place is run by someone named Blue Jones (Oscar Isaacs), a sleazy wretch who dresses like a night club operator and employs the girls to put together shows to entertain his ""high rollers"". Consider this scenario and then consider that this is the fantasy that Baby Doll has conceived in her mind as an escape. Why create a fantasy of even worse imprisonment as an escape from your already horrible imprisonment? Why not fantasize about green fields, happy times or even Disney World? Wait it gets worse. Blue Jones and Dr. Gorski figure out that Baby Doll quite a spicy little dancer. She puts on sexy little dance routines that apparently get the everyone all worked up. That's terrific, except for one thing: We in the audience never see her dance routine! Whenever she begins to dance she is transported to a further fantasy world where she is in the middle of war zone. There, Baby Doll, Sweet Pea, Rocket, Blondie and Amber go to war armed with heavy metal weapons against ghosts, steam-punk Nazis, Battle Droids and a fire-breathing dragon.<br/><br/>The war zone fantasies take place in Tibet, a dragon cave, a future world and a strange steam-punk re-imagining of World War II. Baby Doll is mentored in these scenes by a wise man listed in the credits as . . . Wise Man. He's played by Scott Glenn with a wink and a smile and nonsense advice like ""If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything."" What that fortune cookie advice has to do with this movie is beyond me.<br/><br/>So too is the fact that the war zone scenes are a fantasy conceived by Baby Doll who is already having a fantasy while strapped to a chair about to have a lobotomy. Are you keeping up with all this? The war zone fantasies are a method by which Baby Doll can hatch an escape plan and get herself and her friends out of Blue John's prison. My logical question: Why did we need the war zone scenes? Why did we need the brothel fantasy? Why did we need the lobotomy? What time period is this? Why is it always night time? Why are the walls of the asylum grimy when the inmates are always squeaky clean? Was this trip really necessary?<br/><br/>*1/2 (of four)"

","If you are not familiar with Zack Snyder movies you got work to do. His imagination is great awesome, with movies like 300, Watchmen and Dawn of the Dead. The story of Sucker Punch is pretty simple if you think it, We encountered Baby Doll(Emily Browning) who is sent to a mental institute where she is going to have a lobotomy in 5 days. She encounters with other girls(portrayed by Abbie Cornish, Emily Chung, Jena Malone and Vanessa Hudgens in an attempt to forget her HSM role) and they have to (in one way to tell)get away from the enemy of the movie Blue Jones(Guatemalan Oscar Isaac). They enter in a world where your imagination is everything and they have to find 5 things. Like the tag line ""you will be unprepared"" this movie has a very original story ""maybe too much original for the USA residents"" If you like girls, guns and action with a bit of story you will love Sucker Punch."

","The first 5 minutes of the film, is maybe the film itself, and maybe the reason to pay the money and go see this movie....maybe not.<br/><br/>This film has no artistic value as compared to '300', so fans of Snyder going to see this because of '300' masterpiece. don't go, it is not.<br/><br/>The film probably can be appreciated by teenagers under the influences of various substances, because that is probably the only way, the only correct way to appreciate this film to some degree. Probably comparison to movie 'speed racer' can or should be made.<br/><br/>Acting does not exist in this film, special effects are poorly done as well as the soundtrack to them, and in general almost all of the scenes are absolutely pointless and tedious. Again for teenagers maybe they are less tedious, hard to tell.<br/><br/>The core of the film is the message that Snyder tries to express. This message is obvious and understandable if you looking at this movie from the right perspective. The problem is that I don't know if the kids will understand this message or if this message was openly conveyed to them.<br/><br/>The 'grandiose' ""plot within a plot"" is that he describes a Strip Club and the inner workings of it, the psychology and the circumstances of the girls who are trapped in this lifestyle. He describes girls, who had bad parents or were abused and ran away from home, and the only way to support themselves became a money making machine of Strip Clubs, then he describes all the internal struggles and hell that many girls are internally dealing with while pursuing this profession. Then, he describes the coping mechanisms to this torture, as for girls to resort to various substance helpers for them to escape their reality or to distort it, and finally the ultimate coping mechanism is to totally stop caring, detach yourself from the horrible reality, and to become a so to speak ""living zombie"", a living dead, a mental suicide of sorts,""self-lobotomy"", the body is alive but the ""soul"" is dead.<br/><br/>Snyder's point at the end is that this is not the way to go, there are other ways to deal with harsh life realities, find a map(goal in life), find a key(a way to attain it), a lighter(a spark within yourself to do it), a knife(fight for your goal) and finally ""the missing element""(yourself). If you will be able to find these, it will set you free, you will attain financial and emotional freedom.<br/><br/>So if the teenagers who will go to watch this movie will grasp the messages that Snyder is trying to convey, then this movie has some value, if they will just go under influence and watch it like a very long, not that interesting video game, then it's just another pebble in the graveyard..."
"MarkRomance","9","4","9","28 March 2011"," ::Warning Major Spoilers:: A good movie, great idea and a 4/5 star follow through. I would suggest you take a view of the film ::Warning Major Spoilers::
","So, first of all i really enjoyed the film the film!<br/><br/>::Major Spoiler Alert::Major Spoiler Alert::Please Know Spoiler Alert::<br/><br/>It gave me a lot of what i wanted and more actually, starting with the silent cold open with Emily Browning singing a version of Sweet Dreams (are made of this) BTW the entire soundtrack i downloaded the night i got home from the movie, really great.<br/><br/>So the beginning was emotional. Though i did wish they added more scenes to explain more of the family life, more of the evil step father and more of the sisters as a family to make me really feel the pain baby-doll went through. After returning home, i found out after research that a lot of scenes were cut from the film, lets just hope that its in the directors cut DVD.<br/><br/>After the title is shown, the main character Baby-doll is taken to the mental hospital which unfolds an entire book of craziness. I really wanted a cleaner transition from reality to the sub-reality but i thought that the camera movements that went from baby-dolls blond hair was great, as it pans around to reveal another actress just acting out a scene. The cuts from sub-reality to fantasy-reality were really good, like the first one with baby-doll in the snow temple getting the first lesson from The Wise Man.<br/><br/>I did want more character development. I wanted to see more personality's of the characters blondie, rocket and amber after they were introduced, as i could already tell that sweet-pea was the tough girl and possible the oldest and baby-doll named after her looks. Madam Gorski was perfect, and actor Oscar Isaac was perfect as Blue, the controlling 'owner' of the girls and the main antagonist. Madam Gorski was a maternal, while blue the main obstacle that stands in their way to freedom.<br/><br/>What i loved about the movie is that it really did give me all the things i like in films: hot bodies, explosions, sultry moves, violence, pretty faces, blood, very short skirts, swords, dancers, fantasy, anime, pain and of course music.<br/><br/>One of my favorite parts was the music, but that is far too much for me to type about that, maybe in the soundtrack review.<br/><br/>With the CGI use, the film reminds me of some other great films the look similar: Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, The Lovely Bones, of course 300 and Watchmen (two films which Director Zach Snyder also directed) It wasn't as tired as some CGI films can get, it was interesting to see the different scenes. I did want more scenery maybe a bit more color, i sort of took the fantasy-reality scenes where the girls have the 4 challenges, I took the settings as similar to levels, like in a video game. Each one was different and unique, with snow dojo, World War setting, castle with fire breathing dragon and futuristic city train. I felt like i was in a really really cool video game, that's another reason why i liked the film. It really gave me that 'anime' dream feel which i love so much.<br/><br/>The film ended in a way i thought was right... with an epilogue ending meant to be happy, though it was emotional and a little depressing; i thought it was honest.<br/><br/>The ending monologue against a black screen was not completely perfect but i realized i did like it.<br/><br/>If you like complex stories with hidden messages and crazy zany actions scenes with hot girls in skirts and lingerie carrying massive weapons of destruction then this movie is for you. I rather enjoyed it, so why wouldn't you??"
"kyle_kar23","10","4","9","28 March 2011"," Sucker Punch is an Instant Classic...
","Where do I begin? In many ways, this movie is absolutely perfect as far as what movie's are meant. I was completely engaged and on the edge of my seat the whole time. I saw this last night in IMAX in San Francisco, and it blew my mind from start to finish. The whole auditorium was packed with hundreds of people, and there wasn't one noise that came from the audience the entire time. And at the end, everyone went into a frenzy shouting, clapping, half the crowd gave a standing ovation. In all honesty, this is the best movie I have ever seen in terms of pure entertainment. Every time a new song would start (and the soundtrack is amazing by the way), I would get chills up my spine because you know you're about to enter a world that's only seen in your dreams. And that's what you get. When Babydoll enters her fantasies- the colors, the sets, the cinematography, the backgrounds, the actors, the sounds, EVERYTHING is so beautifully intensified x100 that you can't help but just let go of your mind and let the breathtaking visuals take over. ""300"" was great, could have had more action. ""Watchmen"" was good, a little slow at times but still good. ""Legend of the Guardians"" was great. But THIS, THIS is a whole new beast of a film. It is Zack Snyder at his absolute best. It races at an unbelievable speed and ferocity that you gotta hold on tight. I'm 100% sure there won't be a better film than this for a long time. Zack Snyder just raised the bar in filmmaking..... REALLY HIGH.<br/><br/>My Score: 15/10"

Another aspect of the movie that truly enhanced it was the music truly great stuff.<br/><br/>The acting from the actresses where as good as can be expected, not Oscar worthy, but I felt Baby Doll's pain, may I add that it's good to have Emily Browning back. <br/><br/>Although the movie was a solid I truly can't help but feel that there was something missing(but don't let that stop you from watching the movie)That is why I'm giving this movie an 8/10, it not perfect, but it most definitely is not boring."

","I really want to rate this movie ten out of ten although I know it definitely doesn't deserve it. But I wanna... For quite some time I was thinking how to write smart and competent review and I've got nothing so far. I can not hook you by short summary without spoiler risks. To abstract some deep thoughtful philosophy out of it I really don't want to even try. Even if there are some I didn't notice them. This movie is simply pure fun of epic proportions. There are some artistic cadres, trippy weird amazing and jaw dropping mindfaks, there's drama and pathetic, there's action and CGI intemperance, sanatorium and whorehouse, little bit of Kill Bill and a bit of Hobbit, alternative history, train hijacking, samurai and trench battles against Germans, incompatible epochs mixed in same scenes, there's everything and everything is awesome. <br/><br/>To lure mail audience, there's bunch of hot girls in sexy battle outfits, armed to teeth with swords and machine guns, who, in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Charlie's Angels and Matrix style, jump out of WWII airplane on running trains and medieval castles to butcher and riddle everything from people to zombies, robots, orcs, and eventually dragons. Complete madness. Zack Snyder is the king.<br/><br/>I do not like Emily Browning in leading role (my only objection to this movie), but Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone and divine Carla Gugino nailed it with both performances and looks.<br/><br/>9/10"

This is a great popcorn flick. You want to watch a bad movie? Go watch the Transformers movie series. I would rather watch this movie instead of Transformers. This movie is just visual eye candy with a great soundtrack. Beautiful actresses with great action scenes.

We proceed through a series of beautiful set pieces which do nothing but establish the invulnerability of our heroines. Where we want to discover more about our characters, we only go through the motions of risking nothing and gaining nothing.<br/><br/>Sure, the ideas are cool, and the special FX department throw a whole host of teenage boyhood fantasies at us.

"yokobagginsoftheshire","9","3","6","25 June 2012"," One of the most underestimated movies of the year, raped by critics, yet even they say it's a must-see.
","The movie is not so much a story as an expression of what goes on in our heads when we end up somewhere unexpected, somewhere inconceivably incomprehensibly just bad. It is like if you're a little kid and get beaten but that place and state of mind don't seem to end, because you're a kid. It is our fantasy, illogical, a mix of emotions and our mind's attempt to make them adhere to reason. The movie as a whole is an expression of man's primal (childish) incomprehension and ignorance of bad and the consequent imagination towards righteousness, retribution, salvation and all the feelings that run in-between. We all have some memories of such and to see them in a movie detailing the feeling is a first! It is a very hard thing to make a movie on the subject, not least because it cannot have detailed protagonists (in our early consciousness we don't explain our traits, we just are). This is the closest I've seen anyone come to achieving it, this movie is a must see, unique!"
"skay_baltimore","8","3","6","7 December 2011"," ***Major Spoilers*** Amazing!!! Effin!!! Film!!!
","Sucker Punch (Extended Cut) is all about the music. It is, essentially, a beautifully stylized (your mileage might vary), multi-layered full length music video/video game montage. It maximizes and prioritizes the lyrics and moods of the songs as they weave their way throughout the story line. The tone for the entire movie is set with the opening song: Annie Lennox's ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of These)"". It's the perfect opening salvo, since the song, like few others, addresses complex human emotional issues – particularly abuse – which is what this movie is all about: the all too unfortunate sexual abuse/molestation of the main character, and how she and those around her try to deal with it. And the fact that it's performed by the lead character gives this movie an unusual sense of authenticity and credibility.<br/><br/>The next number is Roxy Music's (Ferry/Mackay) ""Love Is The Drug"", performed by Dr. Gorski (Carla Gugino) in a Vegas-style number that's top rate. It also begins to develop some of the story line, and it does it in a way that primarily uses images, music, and lyrics to convey both the message and the mood of the film, very similar to a well done music video.<br/><br/>The next song is The Smith's ""Asleep"", performed once again by the lead actor, Baby Doll (Emily Browning), while she's down on her knees scrubbing the floor. Here, the mood changes 180 degrees, and digs deeper into the emotional vault. So as you can see, each song propels the viewer down the multitude of ambivalent channels of the protagonist's mind, heart, and soul. <br/><br/>While Baby Doll is cleaning the floor on her hands and knees, she hears Sweet Pea scream and comes to her defense. The two of them then go to a dance class, in which Sweat Pea is instructed to feel the music, and move in response to what she's feeling. This, in turn, catapults her to an Asian temple, where she obtains weapons and wisdom regarding how to find her path to freedom and defend herself (map, fire, knife, key, and a 5th ""unknown"" element that only she can discern). It's clear that the 3 enemies she then faces are each elements of her inner and outer struggle against her step-father, all of which plays out while Bjork's ""Army Of Me"" is playing. This overlays with the dance class, to which she returns at the end of the fighting scene. Again – the seamless integration of the music with what's happening on screen is masterfully achieved.<br/><br/>Baby Doll then discloses her escape plan to Sweet Pea, Blondie, Rocket, and Amber. Grace Slick/Jefferson Airplane's ""White Rabbit"" (performed by Emiliana Torrini) is the perfect song for the next scene, which is the beginning of the ""dance distractions"" in BD's plan -- through which she can obtain the necessary elements/tools in order to escape. (In this instance, the map) A fundamental spoken line in this scene, delivered by Wise Man (Scott Glenn), is: ""Remember ladies...if you don't stand for something...you'll fall for anything"". Morality in this scene is handled somewhat creatively in that the girls are told that the ""soldiers"" they're about to kill are not actually human. The Germans devised a way to re-animate dead soldiers, but not as Zombies – rather, as steam propelled soldier-bots, so the entities that they're ""killing"" are already dead. The importance of working together is also stressed.<br/><br/>The next scene, in which ""fire"" is obtained, involves ""The Mayor"", who looks just like Winston Churchill, and, appropriately, smokes big cigars – needing – you guessed it – a lighter. The music for this scene is Queen's ""I Want It All/We Will Rock You"", (""I Want It All"" is performed by Armageddon), followed by Iggy Pop's ""Search And Destroy"". This particular section seemed way over the top to me, and was my least favorite part of the movie. But nevertheless, in the end, the lighter/fire was obtained.<br/><br/>The ""knife"" section is set to The Beatles' ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", performed by Alison Mosshart and Carla Azar. Suffice it to say...things don't quite go as planned. And it raises the fundamental question: Who's story is this? The answer: it is ours. Each of us has exactly what we need to fight – for our lives.<br/><br/>Personally, I enjoyed this movie a lot, because it allowed the actor's expressions and actions, combined with the song lyrics and music, to tell the story, as opposed to a bunch of wordy, preachy monologues and/or dialogues (at least until the very very end), which seem to dominate 21 century cinema. The acting, casting, and directing are all right on the mark. And so is the suspense. When it's all said and done, this is an Amazing!!! Effin!!! Film!!!"

At first I wasn't sure what the movie wanted to tell me but while watching the movie more and more of what is happening is clear.<br/><br/>The gift of Snyder is that he can make a movie which lets you focus on one aspect and it turns out to be different. This is what I like to see in a movie where not everything that you see should be taken for granted but you have to think for yourself as well to see more then the screen shows you.

","What to say about this movie? Sure as hell ain't what I expected... but at the same time fulfilled my wildest expectations. I don't know how many of you have noticed, but there is now a plethora of movies that challenge our beliefs of what we think is real. Movie directors have caught on to something and they're guiding us, in their own way, so we come to the same realizations.<br/><br/>Most of the people that didn't understand this movie never had any consciousness expanding experiences.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a eerie atmosphere of reality in which Babydoll's mother dies and her troubles start. She is soon brought to a facility for insane people, and after a quick, but crucial, few scenes the movie sets on a different tone. The girl finds herself in a shared illusion where the girls envision themselves in a brothel. The director emphasizes their view of the world whilst on medication. As the plot thickens Babydoll is transported into a world of her imagination whilst she musters her inner strength to do the seemingly impossible, hence the orgasmic action scenes from our wildest fantasies. A character named Wise Man follows them there and throws seemingly non-story related sayings that are supposed to inspire.<br/><br/>Pretty simple plot, right?<br/><br/>Not really. None of the characters are what they're supposed to be. The way to watch the movie properly is so that you realize that all the characters are archetypes of the human psyche. Babydoll is the innocence suffering in the unjust world, Blue is the personification of the ego run amok, the Wise Man is the voice of guidance within us all, and Sweet Pea is OUR freedom, tricked away from under our own noses, but inevitable in the end. All of the characters can be related to the inner workings of your own mind. Thats what the ancient people did with their myths, as now our own people are creating archetypes so you can understand the situation we all find ourselves in.<br/><br/>We find ourselves in a world that is run by criminals, dominated by ego, and where innocence finds only pain. Snyder is saying to all of us, not just in this movie, but in all of his movies, that we can summon our inner strenght and use it to beat insurmountable odds... and there is guidance. Just look within yourself. You will find all the strength that you need. You have all the weapons you need.<br/><br/>Now FIGHT!!"
"Traveler_12","Null","3","6","15 August 2011"," A lot of people don't get it
","First off, Sucker Punch is nothing like Inception. The idea of alternate or virtual worlds was popularized with Neuromancer and Cyberpunk in the mid 1980s. Now the idea is getting more complex with layers of worlds or realities. It's called a spin off, a creative evolution, and you can look forward to more stories with this type of mechanism. Isn't it exciting to think of how deep we can take this rabbit hole?<br/><br/>Now although the average rating equates to 6 stars or so, Sucker Punch doesn't get a lot of mediocre reviews. Either people hate it or they really like it. To those people who hate it and rag on it and say it's bad, I've got to vehemently say - you just don't get it. Your average uneducated critic will hold up the same banal template to every film. Like they're the king on a throne saying ""entertain me, follow this guide if you want to have success"". Often considered are these constituents of story writing: Characters, plot, setting, yadda, yadda, yadda. Often overlooked are these constituents: Theme, message, soul. What about the subject, the whole purpose of the story?<br/><br/>Sucker Punch sends an empowering message to young women that are subjugated, victimized, ravaged. It delivers a complicated message in a stylized artistic presentation. If an artist can make someone victimized feel powerful, that is an achievement. If you don't think that is important, I can't help you. It's not always about your royal ass being entertained in new ways. What a pity when people loose compassion and empathy. What a pity when people don't care because they've ""seen it before"". You've got to view this film and let it be what it is instead of what you wanted it to be. I thought it was a fun ride done with Snyderific style, and very much worth viewing again. On the simple side there is lots of exciting things to watch with rising suspense. And at least the first time you watch it you have to use your brain to connect the dots about ""what world you're in, and why you're in it"".<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is a work of art but it has its faults. Like all art, it's compromised by commercialization. I don't need to itemize the problems; so many people have already done a great job with that. Zach Snyder and his team had so many parties to please: The production studios, the investors, and the perceived target market(s). Change this, cut that, dumb that down, jazz that up. For art to be all it can be, the artist must focus on the heart of the vision and convey it's meaning no holds barred which you can't do in a commercial environment. When art is created for an audience it suffers, but that's show business."

It's made clear from the outset that most of what you're seeing probably isn't real but is instead in the main character's head (so the fantasy scenes are probably not real, but equally the reality bits probably aren't either) and I think that contributes to the feeling of not really giving a damn whether our heroes triumph or die.<br/><br/>Certainly it's watchable, and I'd possibly even go so far as to say it's pretty decent (I remind you of all the great stuff in the first paragraph!).

"OmNomNom_NomNom","5","3","6","13 April 2011"," Impressive, energetic, visually brilliant... But not good.
","When you cannot be bothered watching anymore critically acclaimed dramas about cocaine or politicians, you decide to inject a little more of the entertainment factor into yourself, and watch some mindless action movie. With half-naked girls. With guns. Inside robots. Killing orcs. And steampunk soldiers. And demonic samurais. That hold gattling guns. Oh, and dragons too. When these breed together with a more-than-meets- the-eye story, it just gets all flat.<br/><br/>I'll give credit for what director Zack Snyder came up with - In the beginning, it looked like it would all work. It seemed however, he got lazy right after the incredible, slow motion opening scene. The first weakness of Sucker Punch kicks in with unnecessary, cringe-worthy dialog.<br/><br/>From that point, it takes time to introduce everyone and their situation. The girls - Babydoll (Emily Browning), Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung) all want to escape. So they come up with a plan, a very simple plan - To find a few items that would help them escape. And to get those items, they engage in a distracting dance, which we never see. It is portrayed as a highly stylized action sequence. The sad thing is - despite the fact that they look excellent - they aren't excellent. They do work well with the plot, but that isn't important. The plot did not give any motivation whatsoever for the girls to act so violent.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is not the film I wanted it to be. It almost worked, but it was rushed in terms of execution. Snyder proved how visionary he is with his earlier films, 300, and Watchmen. He can direct, that's for sure, but he struggles with the writing. With Christopher Nolan, I'm sure he can make the upcoming Superman: Man of Steel a success."
"hollywoodkiddo","Null","3","6","29 March 2011"," Beautiful Visuals, Ultimately Disappointing
","I went to see this movie with high hopes, as I Love action films where women are empowered and shown as warriors. I'm also a fan of previous Snyder films, mainly 300 and Watchmen. <br/><br/>The film was set up beautifully in the beginning, the audience really feels connected with Baby Doll as she is put through the ringer by her very evil Stepfather, and thrust into a disturbing mental institution. We see her wage war against monsters and robots alike (via her imagination), and against humans as well. Her imagination also brings the girls that live in the mental institution into her battles, and they help her complete different missions that are assigned to her. Mix in the fact that she only enters into these supernatural battles when she begins to dance provocatively. All the makings of a great film, right?<br/><br/>This is where the disappointments start to creep in. While her dancing is the key to these realms, and much of the scenes take place on stage or in a ballet studio, there is little to no dancing at all in this film. Baby Doll is supposed to put men and women alike in a trance when she dances, yet we only see her journey to the battlegrounds, and are never able to see what she does with her dancing that is so hypnotic. <br/><br/>Baby Doll is the leader of the battles and the escape plan for the other girls, and we are rooting for her for the entire film. Cut to . . .<br/><br/>The biggest letdown of the whole film happens at the end, when Snyder basically in an instant has Baby Doll sacrifice herself for the only other remaining girl left from the group, Sweet Pea, the girl who also complains about the escape plan for the entire film. In a way, it's almost like he wrote the entire film with the objective of setting up Baby Doll to lose. This to me was such a disappointment, because the audience has spent the greater part of 2 hours rooting for this girl, wanting her to win, and perhaps gain vengeance on her Stepfather, only to see her be lobotomized and left brain dead. <br/><br/>Great visual effects and fabulous hair, makeup, and costumes, yet an ultimately disappointing experience for the audience."
"blagoev-lachezar","Null","3","6","28 March 2011"," Sucker Punch- A lot of everything good
","I just came home after seeing Sucker Punch, and decided to post a few comments while my memories are still fresh. First I'd like to say that I enjoyed the movie- it had an interesting and to a large degree unpredictable storyline, lots of visual effects, and was full of action. The viewer is tossed in the storyline from the get go, and even though the beginning may be a little confusing to some, everything becomes clear as the movie progresses. The concept of Sucker Punch kind of reminded me of Inception, and I must say if you liked the Leonardo Di Caprio movie, definitely see this one! The visauls resembled the ones used in 300 (the camera kept shifting and moving around the battle field, allowing the viewer to see the fight from many different angles) but I must say seeing half naked girls in the place of Leonidas and his men was a lot more appealing to the eye. Fruthermore the movie was I would say very motivational and if you have the right mindset while seeing it, it can really give you the goosebumps. As a whole Sucker Punch has elements from previous movies, and puts them together in such a way that definitely won me as a big fan! I can say that this movie has a lot of everything we have enjoyed seeing in older movies. Still I must say a little more detailing wouldn't have hurt. Before some of the fights I noticed that the main character was wearing high heels, and then during the fight itself she had other shoes on... there also were a couple of other annoying little details which kept ruining the overall experience for me, but I don't want to concentrate my review around them. In conclusion I would like to say that this movie is a must see for everyone who enjoys a good storyline, a lot of action, and is open to ""fantastic"" adventures. I give my both thumbs up for Sucker Punch and can't wait for the DVD to come out so I can buy it!!!"
"Pixy-Chan","6","3","6","27 March 2011"," I feel like this movie wasted a lot of its potential
","This is a movie I really wanted to like. I own all of Zach Snyder's other films and have always been happy with his ability to make to make great movies from simple concepts.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch did not feel as tight or well organized as his other films. I will try to explain this with minimum spoilers, but I know a few minor ones will slip in so consider yourself warned.<br/><br/>I went into this movie with hesitation, which was all but gone when I saw the opening. The part explaining why she's in the asylum was amazing.<br/><br/>I stayed completely interested until they got in the main fantasy world, though I'll admit it's probably a personal bias since I find the idea of people messing with your mind in an asylum far more terrifying than having to sleep with people in a bordello. Still, at this point in the movie there was nothing that I really disliked, but I didn't think it matched the quality of the opening.<br/><br/>The first two action sequences were cool, though having watched a lot of anime and live action Japanese movies I found the graphics to be cool, but not revolutionary.<br/><br/>From here on out, I thought that the action sequences got worse. This wasn't because of the enemy, I like dragons and robots far better than samurai and reanimated corpses, but they weren't as engaging. Up until this point in the movie there had been a stress on family, yet I thought the third battle contradicted this a bit. The danger of the fourth battle seemed forced, and the zooms, pans, spins, and slow downs against the robots made the battle feel more disjointed and chopped up rather than more epic like in 300.<br/><br/>I liked ending of the movie and didn't have a problem with the tone or the events as I've read other reviews complain about. Still, it wasn't so great that it made me forget about my issues during the middle of the movie.<br/><br/>I would disagree with the reviews saying the story was weak or the themes were non-existent. There are several themes touched upon that were not explored as deeply as I would have liked, but I can see how people that loved this movie can argue that the movie was deep. Still, I did thought the way the movie tried to tell the story and showed the themes felt a uneven and disjointed. There are parts of this movie I'd really like to watch multiple times as short films, but I found the overall film to be inconsistent. Maybe the director's cut will be better?"

Truly awful, clichéd rubbish. Horrible, and this coming from someone who quite enjoys video games and manga? Actually, Japanese movies have been released recently that pretty much look the same, perhaps they're better? Jack Snyder confuses me, 300 and this movie are terrible, yet I did quite like Watchmen. He wrote this drivel himself apparently, perhaps that's the key. Also, the cringeworthy renditions of classic songs, Pixies and The Stooges, that was unforgivable..."

Come to this if you simply want to see this particular fimmaker steamroll in one swoop through a bunch of different movie formats so you won't have to when he devotes feature length time to one of them in the future.<br/><br/>Or to jeer at how the movie pretentiously wants us to indulge the notion about what place we occupy in what world, while romancing us that we have the tools inside to master our selves and ""be free"", as unfolding in the most simpleminded of fantasy worlds, where evil stepfathers commit innocent daughters at evil mental hospitals run by evil nurses, where 'troubled' characters experience predictable changes of heart.<br/><br/>Or, if you were curious, to see what the ""visionary director of 300"" has filled his Ipod with since Watchmen.<br/><br/>Or to be simply dismayed at the flimsy facade that purports to mask violence as game. The mentor says so; these Nazi soldiers are dead, so nevermind about killing them. So the kids won't be confused about what it is they're actually watching. If you stayed this long, stick it out to watch someone else finish the video game.<br/><br/>What about the 'female empowerment' angle mentioned by fans of it?<br/><br/>So the girl in this kicks a guy in the crotch. They tear through an army of male zombies. All the while looking like what the guys in the audience want them to look. Better yet, what to make of the fact that it is the girls who fantasize themselves as scantily-clad eye candy, precisely as the men who desire them look at them?<br/><br/>The opening credits of Watchmen is for me the only time where Snyder exhibited some talent. He has some sort of eye for a tableaux, but his notions about storytelling or moral dilemmas I find juvenile at best. This is why the posts exist for art directors or camera operators in the film world, not everyone has to direct."

","Sucker Punch is One Flew Over The Cukoos Nest, Inception, and lots of video game like elements all rolled up in one. This movie is getting a lot of negative reviews. In my opinion Sucker Punch is no way near the masterpieces that Watchmen and Inception were. But still not a bad movie.<br/><br/>The story starts with Babydoll(Emily Browning) is sent to a Mental hospital cause of a tragic event that happened in her life, during that time she befriends Sweet Pea(Abbie Cornish), Rocket(Jena Malone), Amber(Jamie Chung),Blondie(Vanessa Hudgens). And Babydoll comes up with a plan to escape, and gets the others in on this. BabyDoll creates a fantasy world, where she is a super warrior, in hopes that it will help her and the others escape. But the question is will it? <br/><br/>Zach Snyder is quite a visionary director, not as good has Watchmen and 300, but still an entertaining film. Browning, Cornish, Malone give descent performances, but Chung, and Hudgens are not that interesting, except when they are in the fantasy scenes when they are a female A-Team. Carla Gugino, and Oscar Issac are good in there roles too. I say don't be influenced by the negative reviews, see this movie and form your own opinion."

","I am honestly the kind of person who usually like this kind of movie. I got blown away by any terrific visual movie and CG movie and Zack Snyder has always exceeded my expectations. Therefore I was expecting a LOT from this movie, specially when I saw the first trailers. I knew the story, I knew It could be kinda crazy and couldn't make any sense at all, but if I'd bet 1 million dollars that this movie would surprise me I'd surely lose. This is by far one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. I was praying for the movie to end or join the people that was leaving the theater. Why didn't I? Because I was still hoping until the very last second of the movie for something to happen that could make any sense to that junk. Things that I completely disliked: The action is so boring that made me wanna cry, the acting is completely expendable, the lines, oh boy, how come you made Scott Glenn talk some rubbish like that? And the STORY, obvious. At the end I wanted to join Baby Doll in a lobotomy just to forget about this movie. The only two things not expendable are: the visuals and the girls and this is why I gave any points to this movie. I only regret they were not used in a proper outstanding project. It made me wonder why the studios have been canceling so many great projects out there and spending a huge amount of money in a project like this. Zack, excuse my honesty, but you clearly lost it and I hope and pray for you to succeed back with Superman."

The cinematography in Sucker Punch pales in comparison to Ultraviolet.<br/><br/>I gave it 4/10 stars because the fight scenes were very enjoyable.

","A young girl is locked in a mental institution. In other to avoid being lobotomized, she devises a plan that involves a series of missions in fantasy territories she must fulfill with the aid of other female inmates.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder has loads of talent for visual wonders. His forte is a breathtaking cocktail of stylized violence and eroticism. He makes bloodshed pretty and sexual. Which is okay with me as long as we don't mistake these dark juvenile fantasies for real life.<br/><br/>The problem is that, as far as one can judge from this his first original script, when left on his own, he simply has no story to tell.<br/><br/>The script feels like a five lines document that was pitched to the studio heads, containing a cool log line (""Alice in Wonderland"" with guns, I've read somewhere else on this IMDb page), a sort of mythical structure borrowed from a Christopher Vogler lecture (The Heroine's Journey! wow, wow, this is deep!"") and a couple of platitudes supposed to serve as the THEME, which as every how to write scripts manual reminds us is the most important thing in a movie. So here that would be umh... ""fight for your dreams"", ""yes you can"", ""freedom is good, I guess"".... And that was that. They went into production with those five lines. Who needs a full script when we have full lips and bucketfuls of style? I'm being intentionally mean cause this could have been sooo much better. To quote Elvis Costello: All this useless beauty. And the excellent actresses try and try like real troopers, but there simply is nothing to work with. They've been let down by the director/writer.<br/><br/>If Mr. Snyder and co. had cared a bit more about creating good characters and telling a story (a regular story would have been enough), and less about choking the movie with style and borrowed references, this could have been a GREAT fantasy movie.<br/><br/>Oh well, better luck next time.<br/><br/>One last thing.

I would strongly suggest this movie to all teenagers and/or fans of video games or violent anime. If you are looking for a strong character driven story that is deep and thought provoking, this is not your movie.<br/><br/>While watching, I tried my best to watch subjectively and avoid being blinded my scantily clad women being very violent (one of the sexiest I can imagine). Keeping that in mind, I can say that the movie is very much driven by the visuals, not the story. Although the plot was not to strong, and at times confusing, it did its job, gave the visuals meaning and context without the feeling of ""why the hell is this necessary?"" The plot had enough content to keep me fully involved with what was going on and had bright shining moments but honestly, it is not the reason you would buy tickets.<br/><br/>This movie was so squarely aimed at my demographic that it is hard to remove bias, so I won't and i will give it a 10/10 and buy my tickets to see it again. If you are a teenager who enjoys stunning visuals, very well filmed and edited fights, hot female leads, and a video game style plot that resembles a real life anime this is your perfect movie as well.

Yes the movie is visually compelling and there are some memorable set pieces , but that alone does not make a movie good. Zack Snyder had a good story and a vision , but the story narration was lost between focus on CGI and costume designs. What was even a bigger letdown was the fact that many things are left unexplained . It's not that it's an open ended film , it feels more like the director almost forgot to explain things and hastily puts in five minutes of epilogue that goes above the head of an already bewildered audience. In spite of the poor story narration , the cinematography and music is great, i would recommend this movie to those who have little expectations from this film and have nothing to do on a weekend."

","When I was fresh out of the movie hall after watching this one (and it has only been a couple hours since then), I wanted to go right back in!<br/><br/>Watching this movie, I already guessed what the critics would be saying. Something along the lines of a genre mash-up served for drooling fan-boys, and all visual and no storyline, and average acting that depends a lot on the technical superiority, and on and on and on. But somehow, it doesn't matter! Yes, the story could have been a little better explained - like how an insane asylum suddenly becomes a 'gentlemen's club', and why is it that we never get to see the awesome dance that Babydoll performs in her trance-like state which seems to mesmerize everyone. But, as I said, it doesn't matter!<br/><br/>I had the misfortune of reading one critic's comments before posting this review where he opined that this movie will make sure that Zack Snyder never gets a free-rein to make what he wants ever again. I do not agree with it mostly because this movie proves that Zack can direct almost anything that appeals to the taste of modern young movie audiences. This is his canvas and he proved that he can make anything look good. He hasn't handled the touchy-feely emotional part of this movie very well, but for me, as I am sure for many, it hardly matters.<br/><br/>My only true gripe with the movie is that it ended too soon. The final few minutes felt rushed. I was hoping for more dream-sequences and more action during the final moments. But I also feel that the movie studio had some say in the theatrical cut and that a Director's cut would make things much much more fun.<br/><br/>I leave here being satisfied that this world will see a lot more awe-inspiring stuff from Zack for many years to come!"

Snyder must truly loathe his audience something fierce to offer up this crock of ""you-know-what"" as his idea of worthwhile entertainment.<br/><br/>And - If that wasn't annoying enough as it is - I can't seem to recall any other movie that I've seen in the past that has shown more disdainful contempt and outright derision, for both men and women, as does the likes of Sucker Punch.<br/><br/>All-in-all - This $82 million fiasco production repeatedly scraped the absolute bottom of the barrel on all counts."
"shinoda_fujiman_21","10","6","17","27 March 2011"," The PERFECT Film.....PERIOD!!!
","OMG!!! The film perfectly titled ""Sucker Punch"" is one of, if not THE greatest original film i have seen in a long time. The entire story, concept, script, everything was conceived through the mind of director Zack Snyder. No manga to film no video game adaptation, straight edge hardcore inspiration from one of the greatest directors today. Right from the beginning the story grabs you and takes you in as hard as it can pull with a brilliantly chilling opening and dynamic scenery. Beautiful sound design throughout the entire film keep you right there in the pits with Babydoll and the gang as they fight for there freedom. The cinematography is almost perfect, the make-up is beautiful and the visual effects rival that of James Cameron's ""Avatar"". The story, although at the beginning a bit difficult to grasp i admit, is daring, fresh and inventive. The development of the characters is both a marvel and an emotional roller-coaster experience for the audience and almost demands your undivided attention. The ending, although could have been better, is a fitting end to an almost perfect film for sci-fi, anime, action, adventure, drama and suspense fans worldwide. In my opinion, this film rivals Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"". A definite must see! A definite must own when available on DVD! This film is AMAZING!!!!!! 10 out of 10!!!!!!!"

","well what is there to say, this film has annoyed me so much that I am writing my first ever review on a film. I am just shocked and what could potentially have been a good film has turned into.<br/><br/>when I first read the the description I was skeptical of a fantasy adventure based on a girl in a mental institution and her imaginary world this normally means that the director has taken the liberty of doing what he wants with no care for anything else. but I thought I would give it a watch. For the first 5 minutes i took a step back and thought this might be a good film with the chilling song 'sweet dreams' being played as a tormented girl deals with her mothers death and takes on her abusive step father with a gun resulting in her being placed in a mental institution and in need of a way out before she is lobotomized. but that is as good as it gets.<br/><br/>we then enter the fantasy world of 'Baby Doll' a dancer stuck in a mens club trying to find freedom. then from that we enter a second fantasy world of war and destruction including: Robots, Nazi Zombies, Dragons, knights and god only knows what else. As soon as I saw this I knew my fears had been confirmed the director has just put anything and everything into this film to try and make it a hit, and it hasn't worked. By all means some of the CGI is good and some scenes have been shot well but it just doesn't matter because it has already been ruined.<br/><br/>I feel that had the film continued on from the first 5 minutes (which was brilliantly filmed and hit all the right notes) in a state of reality with an innocent girl trying to break free from this hideous place where she was going to be kept prisoner and doomed by her step father who had bribed the DR so that the truth about his abuse never came out, then this film could have been a massive thriller/horror hit up there with 'the ring'. but greed obviously go the better of the creators who wanted big action fight scenes that in this day and age as far as i am concerned are a thing of the past.<br/><br/>Don't bother to watch this pick and mix shambles of a film, your better off watching the drunks come out of a pub on a Saturday night."

This one I hate even more because you already know that the end will be tragic, and then actually getting to it is incredibly boring.<br/><br/>I think my husband summed it up nicely: You can't have a movie comprised of someone's delusions without having regular cut backs to reality.<br/><br/>The entire thing was one girl's delusions, and then delusions on top of *those* ones, with no reference as to what might have actually been happening in ""reality"" (we can guess, but we shouldn't have to). When I realised that this movie was never going to be anything more than a pathetic mission to retrieve four items and then ridiculously pointless fight scenes, it was such a drag having to sit through the rest of this bore-fest.<br/><br/>Honestly, one of the worst movies I've ever seen."

It has nothing in it either true OR enjoyable for both male and female audience...at least of an intelligent mental capacity.

","I really love action, scifi and fantasy movies. I also sometimes like pointless movies with just violence and hot dressed babes.<br/><br/>I saw this sucker punch movie yesterday. From the beginning to the end i had a question mark floating over my head. I really do not get if there should be any lesson told with that flick. Or for which kind of audience it was made. I even did not got the movie genre.<br/><br/>It surly has nothing to do with watching a popcorn movie with hot teenagers. Its just to sad for that. Are there really people out there who think that mentally ill women, which are hallucinating that they are whores are in any way sexy? <br/><br/>Also the ""action"" scene did not do there job. Well, yes it was common ninja, gunfire, dragon, Nazi zombie whatever stuff. This is normally fun. But it is not when you are aware, that this is only something like a last broken-hearted dream of a mental patient, one second before she is lobotomized.<br/><br/>And finally the true story behind that dream scenes are not connected to the rest of the movie. Sure the dream scenes should be something like a reflection of what happens in real. But that is not a twist in the story or something. Everyone is aware of that from the beginning. <br/><br/>This movie is sad and pointless in any way. And the sadest thing about it is, that so many people waisted 90 min of there lifetime to watch it.<br/><br/>But i think there is one hidden joke in it. Maybe the whole story of the movie is not a reflection of the patient. What if the movie should be a reflection of the audience? That is the only thing which would make sense for me. If the message of the movie would be: Only lobotomized people are hallucinating sense and a message into a pointless movie. Even if it is noting more then a collage of uninteresting drivel combined with missing logic and a collection of random action sequences."

Facing a lobotomy she escapes to a fantasy world and her and her other inmates plan their escape. This is an absolute mess of a movie. This is another movie that felt like there were 25 writers and no one wanted to say no to any idea that was given.

If this is your type of movie then you will be in heaven. To be fair I did watch the extended edition and found it to be boring, (the theatrical version may have taken some of the unnecessary footage out) and I kept falling asleep in parts so I'm not 100% on the plot lines, but I have a feeling that I didn't miss much. I know many will love this movie, I just couldn't get past how absurd it all seemed. Overall, this felt like a movie that didn't know what it wanted to be, so it tried to be everything at once.

","Fifteen minutes in I could only just barely discern a plot line, but had no idea who the characters were, nor was I given any reason to care about them beyond the most superficial insinuation of highly sexualized vulnerability. The film is essentially a high-budget and spectacularly shallow music video. Hard to judge the performances as there is little story or real dialogue beyond all the posing & choreography; sort of a pity given the leads (Browning, Malone, and Cornish) who have had strong performances in their past. The production and art design stand out... as do the costumes... The steam-punk/sci-fi/fantasy theme is visually interesting, and vaguely entertaining at best. A faintly misogynistic Alice in Wonderland by way of Heavy Metal 2000. Mostly a bore."

","I had an open mind when I started watching this movie!<br/><br/>It starts out brilliantly like slow motion music video to a remake of Eurythmics ""Sweet Dreams"" They captured all elements that had to be there and i thought... ""wow that is gonna be a great movie""<br/><br/>Well turns out I was horribly wrong! It was supposed to be a spectacle of special effects and a clever story but it was not! The story wasn't clever, it was pretentious and nothing else! They were trying to confuse the audience by multiple realities and in the end even who the leading person in the story is! The entire story could be told in 4 lines! They filled the time with completely unrelated fighting scenes that has been packed with goofs and sometimes bad CGI (CGI Breath in the first fighting scene, door is suddenly open during the zombie Nazi fight, Babydolls Hair grew back black in 2 scenes while in all others she was completely blond, Stab wound of the ""pimp"" has magically dislocated)<br/><br/>I said unrelated fighting scenes because she was escaping into another alternate reality! People might want to read metaphors into all that nonsense but there haven't been many metaphors! It was a bunch of mini plots randomly inserted into the mini plot. The mediocre fighting scenes mostly been in super slow motion and has been seen a million times before! I could of coped with the fact that she escapes into this reality where she is a super chic in god mode but that she had to bring her pointless friends into it made it even worse! In order to get excited about a character you need to get warm with them first! The Director didn't let us get warm he sent them straight into battle which was pointless! One might find the brilliance of teamwork in these scenes but it wasn't because all of them died, except of one, the one we ALL liked least and it turns out she was who the story was all about and BabyDoll was nothing but her Guardian Angel!<br/><br/>You achieve confusion in the audience when you keep them on board but it became predictable at least after the 2nd fighting scene, all the confusion in the end is supposed to make people put the pieces together but you will only do that if you are still interested which I was not!<br/><br/>Except for the first 3 minutes and the Soundtrack there was not much to enjoy about this movie! Probably if it was 3 hours longer they could of told the story better but in this version this is one of the worst movie in 2011 so far! 2 Stars for the opening scene and 1 star for the sound track! 3 Stars is generous my friends!"
"No-Explanation","5","4","10","21 April 2011"," Suckerpunch in the stomach!
","Review Two: Suckerpunch<br/><br/>A popcorn flick with far too much between the part that makes it popcorn, and too little substance to be anything but. ""The film achieves exactly what it wanted to and does it well, the issue lies within the fact that the film exists!""<br/><br/>Zack Synder played one too many video games while writing what could be the best popcorn flick of 2011. Is that really enough though? The film contains World War II Zombies (Call of Duty), Dragon's, Castles, Battle Mechs, Girls in skimpy clothing and non-stop action. The comparisons to video games aren't wrong, and sometimes there is a feeling of watching someone play a game. This isn't a bad thing, and even non-gamers can find appeal in this film.<br/><br/>However, amongst the midst of the action and fun comes the brothel scenes, which essentially are tediously boring. Essentially, this isn't because the scenes are bad, but the sudden contrasting after getting so hyped up leaves a lot to be desired of the brothel. The whole film revolves around a 'dance world' and the reality, but the transfers make little sense, and is just an excuse to throw in some entertaining action sequences.<br/><br/>People say the film is overly sexual, to which is disagreeable. The characters costumes aren't overly revealing and are somewhat artistically appealing. It's also said to have an awful story, of which I can agree to. The story is made out to have extreme depth and meaning, but truly people think way to much into it. An unreasonable twist somewhat defeats the purpose, and the film as a whole, while it does have an interesting story, the way we receive it is awful.<br/><br/>Audiophiles will be stunned at the quality of the music and sound effects, from covers of Sweet Dreams (Eurythmics) to 'Where is my mind?', you'll find yourself immersed in what could be classified a musical had the music have more involvement than just audible connection. Would I watch this film again? Only for the action sequences.<br/><br/>Ratings: For Gamers: Six out of Ten Nazi Zombies. The appeal is there, the execution is not. For mindless action and graphical excitement: Eight out of Ten Dragon's. For those looking for a good narrative and/or are intrigued in film as an art: 2/10 SOLID RATING: 4/10. This film isn't classified as good, but nor is it bad. I recommend viewing it, but only for the action sequences which are extremely well done."

If the point was to bring a metaphor, i can say that in my opinion it was a flop. <br/><br/>I was expecting more of a ""Watchmen"" touch, but truth is - dark theme sets only the mood, while the whole movie experience lies in the plot. There is no plot here.<br/><br/>So, what is ""Sucker Punch"" in the end? Ambitious? Indeed! Worthy? Not at all.

","I love this movie a whole lot but I've found so many people hate bashing it. And the reason why is I think they don't understand it. There is really no movies out there like this one, except for Scott Pilgrim. So it's a new venture for film. It's pretty much a video game movie done right, just not based off any particular game. The movie plays like different levels of a game, each in their own world, with a different objective to achieve.<br/><br/>Also it has a video game type of story telling, where you don't question how things work in this world, they just happen and it's cool. Similar to the film Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World, in where they fight with pretty much fantasy powers that no one questions, they just go with it. But just like Scott Pilgrim it's a movie for people who grew up in the 90's with video games, anime, and anything from Japan.<br/><br/>Well it's definitely not a movie for anyone and everyone but if you grew up in the 80's and 90's playing video games and watching anime you should appreciate what it this flick represents."

","I had been anticipating the release-date (march 25th 2011) of the new action-adventure film ""Sucker punch"" for weeks after my friend Stefan had showed me the trailer on the video-site Youtube.<br/><br/>Between watching the trailer for the first time, and actually going to see the film, I had probably watched it about ten times. (And then about the same amount again when the second trailer was released) It seemed that every time I watched it, I picked-up on some small unique difference than I had missed previously. Whether it be an extra zombie-samurai wielding a triple-barrelled rail-gun or another massive fire-breathing dragon ready to dole-out another inferno-sized fire ball ready to engulf the four leading characters in the film.<br/><br/>On the subject of the actors, the four that appear in this film aren't the typical burly ""its time to kick ass and chew bubble-gum, but i'm all out of gum"" male actors. In fact, they aren't men at all.<br/><br/>The four actresses ""Baby-Doll"" (Emily Browning) ""Sweet-Pea"" (Abbie Cornish) ""Rocket"" (Jena Malone) ""Amber"" (Jamie Chung) and ""Blondie"" (Vanessa Hudgens) were very good and in fact much better than the standard shown by similar actresses in similar roles.<br/><br/>Probably the best thing about sucker punch is that it draws on so many other great action-adventure films for inspiration. For example, the dragon sequence where a massive dragon awakes and makes its wrath know, is reminiscent of scenes from ""Dungeons and Dragons"" whilst the scenes of steam-punk Nazi zombies are a good reflection of the popular pop-culture reference of Nazi zombies in such films as ""Dead Snow"" and ""Zombie Lake"".<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this film to anybody that loves action-films and games and geeks alike."

Why were the girls in the kitchen in their brothel outfits when they should have been in grey uniforms? Why was the music from 3 years ago - Bjork, Where is my mind youtube cover? What was the point in getting the knife, as per her 'insight' from the wiseman, when there was no use for it for the escape other than an excuse to kill off a character? What was the point in killing another two girls off? Why did Blondie tell on them - at what point did it seem as though the bizarre plan wasn't going to succeed, and what part of her 'personality' provoked such a stupid response? <br/><br/>The whole movie felt like a theme park ride on a rail, or the most banal video game with no free will and Zelda-like characters that have no voice and are only spoken to: ""whats your story?...oh its complicated, i get it."" The main female characters were simply a vehicle for a boring male director to exact his fantasies upon (not to say i didn't enjoy 300 or Watchmen), which only made it difficult for the actresses to perform in a descent fashion since there was absolutely no script or plot - baby doll probably said about 20 words for the whole 2 hours (few of which had any consistent or appropriate emotion, besides a flicker of sadness at slicing the baby dragon), and at no point did she exert any real passion in her 'real' life except when she rescued her friend from the cook. <br/><br/>What should have been a story exploring the plight of young girls fighting against slavery, corruption and sexual exploitation turned into a semi-erotic (but carefully designed to get views from the PG-13 demographic) and degrading depiction that essentially degenderized the characters - in what capacity does a young innocent and damaged girl dealing with terrors and haunting memories in the 1930s (one assumes) imagine orcs, dragons, nuclear bombs, robots and samuris based on her contextual upbringing?? One wonders. Yeah its fantasy, and yeah its kind of steampunk, but for the viewer to enjoy a movie they HAVE to have some sort of stability to relate to the characters in order to ground the narrative in something that feels like anything. Anything! <br/><br/>And then the fight scenes. Visually exciting? We have all seen every single scene before, minus the inclusion of a samuri sword in the trenches. Lord of the rings, any old zombie movie, a bog-standard WWI (no disrespect) epic, and Moulin rouge, and we've all seen Harry Potter being chased by an angry dragon and slipping under an old bridge to escape. Nothing made any sense, it was vapid, inconsistent, incoherent, chaotic (in its direct meaning), undirected, and generally felt like Snyder was on a deadline and stayed up all night with an army of cutters, editors, producers and CGI specialists, while telling the sound producer to bunk off for the night.<br/><br/>What's the point of exploring a dream sequence if they're always the same people (in no relation to the real people she knows), in the same costumes, doing the same inane and irrelevant tasks that have no relation to reality. What's the point of having 5 characters, except to flesh out the inglorious voids in the narrative to create some sort of texture. To make this 'visual experience' mean anything the director could at least have signed on a dance choreographer to integrate fight moves that related to the mysterious magical dance she performs repeatedly. That would have excited me – it would have been something a little more original and aesthetically stimulating.<br/><br/>Its OK to be inspired by stuff, but come on, have some originality. He took the worst borrowed parts of the best video games and movies and made a mash-up that has wasted our time and dashed our hopes for a highly anticipated film with excellent marketing and beautiful trailer slices."

","Lots of reviews, people feel something about this movie to bother writing in. Outrage or adoration but not look-warm.<br/><br/>Well, I've never played a video game as I'm too old so I don't recognise anything in this movie from video games.<br/><br/>It wasn't what I expected from the trailers. I thought it would be girl power kicking ass, which is pleasant at the time. At one point it reminded me of Charlies Angels,'oh, the girls go off on a mission, & indeed kick ass'. I did feel frustrated however when I thought, we've had 2 missions & have another 3 to go - this is getting a bit tedious. But then I just looked at the beautiful strange sepia landscapes & enjoyed that.<br/><br/>I could almost explode with frustration at one point, I just wish the girls had kneed the guys where it hurts and done them irreparable damage, preferably killed them. The abuse of power was so outrageous & vicious & all the lying crap,'I'm doing this for you, we're in this together,,,blah blah' This reminds me of lots of corrupt people in power, I guess that's why it's so frustrating -- we've all had this to some extent, unless of course we are the one doling it out. I was pondering during the film if it was about corrupt age and power against youth, or men against women - I hear that there are thousands of women and children being trafficked as sex slaves at the moment. But then it felt like our corrupt institutions (Britain) which grind us down & constantly eat away at our rights as fat bankers and politicians smile and tell us it's for our own good they have to raise taxes and put people out of work.<br/><br/>So I think that this film actually took something very unpalatable & just plain nasty (the way we allow ourselves to be bullied by the government), that no one really wants to look at apart from a few outspoken groups - and they dressed it up with beautiful actresses, fab music and amazing visuals, so that we could swallow this bitter pill.

Sexy girls fighting Samurai Demons, Steam-Powered Clock-Work Nazi Zombies, Orc's & Dragons - what's not to like? Quite a lot, as I found out.<br/><br/>The characters appear out of thin air with little or no background story so straight away you don't know them and have no reason to care. They then become embroiled in fantasy battles against warriors, zombies, orcs and robots. Once again, you don't even know the enemy so there's no reason to root for one group over another, no reason to care who lives or dies. Zero emotional investment.<br/><br/>Add to this a convoluted plot, plenty of plagiarism with scenes & characters lifted directly out of other movies (I'm not sure if this was genuine or intended to be humorous but either way it didn't work) and you're left with one seriously unoriginal, boring movie.<br/><br/>The heavy CGI is passable but completely overused (Does a shot of a bus leaving a bus terminal really have to be CG'd?) and although slickly directed and highly stylized, no amount of slow motion shots of semi-naked sex-kittens can mask the story's shortcomings.<br/><br/>I compared the experience of watching this movie to watching a friend play a video game for 2 hours. He's having a great time, but me, I'm just sitting there doing nothing, bored.<br/><br/>The one sterling aspect of this movie was the sound editing and the soundtrack, top marks for this.<br/><br/>Here's hoping the new Superman movie has a great writer on board and some tough producers."

","Sucker Punch, was sucker punk and displayed a very L.A. style for the big screen. The visuals was amazing! The special effects were very neat and crisp. The hair styles and makeup were pristine. However, it does not compensate the fact that this is a bad movie.<br/><br/>I heard it got bad reviews and I still went anyways. I thought to myself, ""It can't be that bad!"" Wow... I was very wrong about that.<br/><br/>The movie was very painful to watch. It was like watching a bad music video after another. It was overly complicated for no reason at all. The dance sequences are fight scenes. Why? The layers of plots and settings were just too complex and unstable.<br/><br/>I was watching the movie, hoping it will end soon, when I see a people walking out. Through out the film, waves of people were leaving and not returning.<br/><br/>The first fight scene was when the main character(Baby)fights, I assume, ninjas. Why? I don't have any idea. These giant size stone ninjas knock her through walls and hit her with force... She's 110 pounds! She gets up and continues to fight unscathed. With that in mind, there's no sense of suspense. Every fight she's in, there's no sense of danger.<br/><br/>Did anything in Baby's dream (or whatever) happen? Did the girls die in the real world? What was real and what wasn't? Why is this movie trying to be Inception? In the end, is baby dead or if she's a vegetable? If she's a vegetable, what's going on in her dream world then?

I think if you take the movie for what it is, you'll have the ride of the year, but if you expect Shakespearian dialogs and minute character depictions... don't, please. I feel all the criticism on this movie is utterly misplaced, it's just what it is guys, come on. To sum it up: ""Candy doesn't need to have a point, that's why it's candy"" <br/><br/>Besides, I was in love with the first part of the movie. I thought it was really powerful the way it was approached, a bit like a silent film noir, which would be appropriate for the time it's set in. I also feel that Emily Brownings is a great actress and she made the absolute most of what she got to work with. She is blond and has big lips, yet doesn't look like your average Hollywood bimbo. She shows a pain and intelligence in her eyes that really gets under your skin. The only questions that rose to my mind was, ""who's fantasy is the cathouse?"" and ""how come it's the same for everyone?"" but those were eased really fast by a simple fact, it's all filmed from Baby Doll's point of view. And why is there so much criticism on the skimpy costumes of the girls? I thoroughly enjoyed that, and I'm female! Ye olde ""OMG this is degrading to women!"" is REALLY getting old, everyone... what is so wrong with girls showing off their body, if they have a body that is so beautiful? I feel that all the actors in the film did a really good job, and this flick is just one big middle finger to the stereotypical shallowness of Hollywood, interwoven with just plain nerdy fetishism of Big-eyed-Nazi-zombie-ass-kicking-school-uniform-wearing hotties. I think this movie is a ""Charlie's Angels steak with a nice, buttery Sin City gravy"" and there's nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>Addition: As I have mulled this movie over for a few days, I came to realize it's much much more than just the blatant eye-candy. THIS candy does actually have a point. I'm agreeing with others on the theories of the use of metaphor for the abuse endured by the girls in the asylum, and it has strengthened my belief that whoever hates this movie, simply didn ""get"" it. So critics: Go see the wizard, and ask for a brain, please."

","I really like this movie. I saw it about 2 days ago and it was great. This movie was not all about action. I was impressed by the way it presented stories and the dark tone. All of the soundtracks did fit the movie. You can feel related to the characters easily especially Babydoll, Sweet Pea and Rocket though you don't know their backgrounds much. I even can't stop thinking about what happened in the movie until now. People who don't understand or get the messages hidden in it may find this movie boring.<br/><br/>What makes me like it more is how much effort the actors put into making this. If you want to know what I mean, you should watch some Behind the scenes videos on Youtube.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch's not cheesy like they first look or seem to be. You have to watch it for yourself."

","I so wanted to love this movie. Sadly, it made for a better trailer.<br/><br/>From a production aspect, this movie is really Zack Snyder's love child. Every frame looks so incredible and gorgeous that it would make a stellar movie poster. But that is all the movie offers.<br/><br/>Apart from Oscar Isaac and the brief supporting role by Scott Glenn, I though the rest of the performances were terrible. Worst being the leading lady Emily Browning. The entire movie is a big fantasy, her character is doing all this kick-ass stuff but she goes through each fantasy sequence like she is a victim and under a lot of pain.<br/><br/>The movie is very poorly written. I did not care or feel for any lead characters; and they were the underdogs. Generally movies like this I'd be rooting for them. Of course it tries to get at soppy in the end. It works a bit but cant save the rest of the bad writing. And speaking of the end, after train mission, the story really wraps up in a tearing hurry, which was probably a smart move.<br/><br/>Another gripe...I wasn't very happy with the first fight sequence, the one with the 3 samurai(?). It looked stunning but something about the choreography just did not work for me, it felt shabby. The other fights were much better.<br/><br/>And lastly, the slow-mo. Zack Snyder, enough already. The entire prologue is slow-mo and felt especially tiring. <br/><br/>All in all, it looks like the new Superman movie will carry a few punches; but if this movie is any indication, Supes may not fly too high. Hope Christopher Nolan holds the reins tightly.<br/><br/>:(("

","I give this a two because some of the visuals were kind of cool (i.e. the enemy soldiers in the world war segment) but over all this movie was just a big mess and on top of that the whole 'fantasy within a fantasy' story line was very very predictable, you can tell almost right away exactly what is happening and what is real and what is not. What is the point of most of this movie? The acting is sub par except the villain is pretty good and Scott Glenn as the wise man is really good, but he is good in everything. Baby Doll is pretty and a good actress but the rest of them are pretty much just awful. John Hamm is totally wasted as the high roller. I was expecting this to be not as good as 300 but still a good movie and it was just terrible! I wish I had walked out after fifteen minutes like my gut feeling said to do instead of expecting it to get better because it did not."
"sandro-santoli","5","4","10","28 March 2011"," Hot for Gamers, Cliché for Everyone Else
","The narrow audience of gamers will like it. Everyone else might find a way to not hate it if you just appreciate the battle scenes without the backdrop of a cohesive plot.<br/><br/>There are several battle scenes throughout the movie that were spectacular. If you look at each battle scene as an individual piece of art without a story line to string them all together, then you might like this movie. Those scenes are beautiful and impressive but you can still tell its someone else's interpretation of battle scenes played out in other movies. One scene was straight out of Lord of the Rings with fiery pit, crumbling castle and Orcs. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, they were interesting to watch. When each one was over, however, you were forced back into the overly simple, drab plot that is closer to a bed time story for teen age boys than an action film for the rest of the world.<br/><br/>The movie is peppered with clichés like, ""If you don't stand for something, you stand for nothing."" Maybe they changed a word or two to try to make them appear as original words of wisdom but you don't have to be quick to catch them. <br/><br/>The plot itself is cliché. In order to escape from the clutches of evil, a girl and her team of sassy warrior-strippers must collect five items. I think I can pull out four of them right now from the junk drawer in my kitchen without having to seduce or outwit anyone. The last item is a mystery...and you'll never guess what it is because it makes no sense unless, of course, you're a sassy warrior-stripper."

Its very difficult to mix and match deep underlying messages and brainless visual scenes.I personally think they cast the wrong girl, my 1st impression was- gee shes tiny, 2nd- ...is she on botox?

But still i think it deserve much better. <br/><br/>The visuals are amazing, set-pieces are jaw dropping and epic in every sense.

"jergasmic","10","4","10","27 March 2011"," Blown away.
","If you know Zack Snyder, you know that people either love his movies or they hate them. This is exactly the case with his newest visual 'Sucker Punch'. Not everyone liked his previous films like, '300' and 'Watchman'. This is also Snyder's first film not adapted from previous work. But the ones who did, were in love. I'm going to come out and just say, that the people that didn't like 'Sucker Punch' probably didn't get it. It's more than just five sexy girls in slutty outfits shooting up the place. It has such a deeper story, and if you're one of the people that picked it up, you'll feel for all the characters so much more. <br/><br/>The story is pretty simple. A teenage girl goes through trauma, get committed to an insane asylum, and is trying to escape. The story seems simple, but it goes so much more deeper than that. She pretty much is using her imagination, to deeply intensify her surroundings. Remember when we were little and certain parts of the floor was hot lava? That's kind of what she's doing. With the help of four other girls in the asylum, she goes on unreal 'missions' to get the key items needed to escape. I wish I could touch more on the deep story, but I feel like it'll give too much away. I'll just say that this movie makes you think. If you actually pay attention to the story, and not just the action, this movie is will be one of the most original movies in years.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was amazing. The visuals, the action, the story, as well as the acting. I must admit, Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung, although not as prominent as I wish they would've been, steal every scene they're in. The soundtrack was awesome, I actually downloaded it as soon as I got home. One gripe I did have with the film, was it's rating. I wish it wasn't PG-13, an R rating would have allowed Snyder to get away with so much more, and I feel like the insanity would have been intensified, which would have been nice to see. If you're a fan on mind bending movies that a lot of people will say 'that didn't make sense'. Think, 'Wizard of Oz', meets 'Inception', meet's 'Alice In Wonderland', with video game action and levels. Remember, that this movie, it's her mind that you're in, and whatever happens, no matter unreal it may seem, that you once believed that certain parts of the ground was lava. Free and open you're mind, and watch 'Sucker Punch'. It's a feast for your eyes, ears and mind."
"campbella722","9","4","10","27 March 2011"," This girl enjoyed it immensely
","I saw that it has not been well received by critics so I felt the need to post a counter point briefly. I enjoyed it. A lot. And I mean, it was an action film so no, it is not going to have Oscar buzz around it (maybe for editing or sound but i digress). But, I'm tired of action films who rely entirely on the visuals and could give a rat's rear end about substance. The acting was solid, the dialog felt real, and the story was better than I think many give it credit for. Oh, and the amazing use of graphics, action direction, and music! I will not go into anymore details than that, but I will leave u with one more thought: even though this film is still geared toward the typical demographic that most action films are made for, it was nice to see a largely female cast show that you can be smoking hot and still kick ever loving ass for a change, not the persistent damsel in distress who only serves as eye candy (or for the memory of whom the main character goes out on a bloody rampage to avenge because she was brutally killed without so much as a single speaking part). Sorry, I did say briefly, so I'll wrap it up. I'm glad I went to see it in the theater, and there are COUNTLESS movies for which I cannot and will not ever say the same."

After the movie, I was talking my girlfriends ear off like a little kid about how awesome this movie was, and the only other movie that had me doing that was the great Avatar. This movie is absolutely breathtaking, to the surprisingly good acting involved, to the great script (i think), and of course, the amazing CGI. The scene with the dragons...wow.

"igbeserk","5","4","10","27 March 2011"," Very hard to digest...
","First review i've ever made on IMDb bear with me :-) I saw this movie yesterday after work, I went in thinking that visually this movie would look nice but story wise it would just be bad. My impressions were right It felt like torture watching this movie. The acting to me was just awful I didn't feel for any of the characters within the movie because their problems, how they were handled and how they came to be just either happened too quickly to make it believable or enjoyable or just was very dis-interesting.<br/><br/>I read one of the reviews here person stating that this is a Zack Snyder movie so don't expect it to be nothing more than good as 300 or the watchmen. I do not agree with that 300 was done very well overall the story was great the action was great, and the watchmen which is based off the graphic novel so no rewrite was needed really was executed as well as it could be for what it was. But this movie is just a girl power type of movie with bad acting cheesy girl power on a mind trip music and lack of continuity. it's like 300 meets inception meets epic movie. visually it looks great like 300. to a certain extent it tries to be like inception with it's reality, sub reality and sub sub realities... But, to a certain extent executes a lot of things poorly like epic movie.<br/><br/>Overall i give it 5 out of 10 visually it's great story wise it could've been so much better."
"christian_pearson16","6","4","10","26 March 2011"," Three months of waiting for this? What just happened?
","Honestly, I went into this movie thinking it was going to be the greatest film ever. The trailer looked epic and I'd been waiting for three months for it to come out. While the effects did not fail to wow me, the film's plot was impossible to follow. I am no idiot, but this movie just did not make sense to me. (SPOILERS) I mean, first they are in an insane asylum which suddenly turns into a prostitution house, which I think was all just in the main characters imagination so it really was an asylum, but everything that she did, including helping a fellow patient escape, actually happened. But, if she really did help a mental patient escape, why was that girl really in the asylum in the first place. Who could have put her there and for what reason? And why was that old guy randomly the bus driver? And how did he know who the girl that escaped was? <br/><br/>Bottom Line:<br/><br/>My main problem with this movie is it has a twisted story just like Shutter Island or such films, but in the end you don't go, ""Oh! That's what really happened!"" You go, ""What the hell just happened?"" If you love awesome effects and being thoroughly confused, then this is the movie for you."
"Petalskull","6","4","10","26 March 2011"," Just as expected, for me at least..
","First of all, I have to say I'm impressed by how many people gave this movie 8 or 9 stars. Note: I'm not trying to seem over-the-top smart, I'm just stating what i think about this movie.<br/><br/>Now about the matter at hand, I'll just come out and say it: I expected a fairly bad movie and that's exactly what I got.<br/><br/>I believe I am part of the target audience (18 years old, I like comic books, samurai and robots shooting rockets) and at the same time I can see how this movie can appeal to many, many people: - the action sequences are, indeed, really good and the fighting scenes will keep you on the edge of your seat - having all the action done by hot girls with at least one of them in a schoolgirl uniform (bordering on fetishism) will be the delight of some viewers - a convoluted action film? Wow cool!<br/><br/>These are all the good parts of the film though, I'm afraid. Everything else feels..lacking and I'll explain why.<br/><br/>1. Directing:<br/><br/>Yep, good old Zack can't stop using his slow motion-fast forward gimmick here either. There's lots of it in the action scenes, even in some places where it clearly doesn't fit (SPOILER: for example that bit in the Nazi war story where the girls sloooowly walk through the trenches, nothing happening around).<br/><br/>Another thing I didn't like is that there's no lighting in some scenes, and although you can see some flashing swords or bullets flying through the air, but the rest is really dark.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the shakiness of the camera is really annoying at times. It works in some movies (say, Cloverfield), but here it's like...come on I want to see what's going on because that CG monster actually is cool.<br/><br/>2. Screenplay:<br/><br/>Here, I think Zack Snyder thought he could do more than he actually can. I've read some reviews comparing Sucker Punch to Kill Bill and I too think it's very similar. They seem alike because both give the feeling that they're movies these guys have always wanted to make, and now finally got the money (or the funding) to do it. It feels like they said ""Oh I sure love samurais, hot chicks, fast cars/ robots (respectively), revenge stories and comic books! But a movie with all of them wrapped into one? God yes!"".<br/><br/>In the end though, Tarantino can not only write better, but he also understands that putting all these things together will limit that movie's seriousness. Kill Bill has moments that are very serious, but also has moments where it makes fun of itself (Bill sitting with a wife he tried to kill and talking about Superman or having a character named Sofie Fatale). Sucker Punch on the other hand keeps a serious tone all throughout and this bothered me. I can't see how a movie with a giant robot with a pink bunny face painted on will discuss matters as serious as (SPOILER) raping lobotomized young girls. I understand that the little stories were a way for the girl to cope with being in a loony bin, but it just doesn't fit, not for me.<br/><br/>In my opinion a story is very much connected to a certain medium. This way, some stories work really well as movies (the battles in The Lord of the Rings have to be seen, literally), some stories work better as books (you can't write a movie about Proust's works) and some stories simply work better as video games. This is one of them. The whole story of the film would be wonderful as a game. A slow and steady prologue, many, many great action scenes and an ending from which you can (maybe) learn something. As a movie, to me it feels shallow. It seems the story is trying too hard to be deep and complex and Zack Snyder hasn't got the skills to pull it off (yet).<br/><br/>Anyway, it's worth seeing on the big screen for the special effects and the sounds as it would look pretty sad on a TV set."

I think they have really good scenes, but in some parts they abused with that ''Matrix'' slow motion effect. But in all the other ways is really worthy to be seen. Is not only meant for men, but for everyone, because it has good performances, credible characters, almost perfect effects, really outstanding music (a lot of them are remixed songs, really gorgeous!) and a lot of action mixed with drama everywhere.

I categorically don't believe it deserves the low ratings most professional critics are giving it. <br/><br/>Yes, it is visually stunning, has action that blows the mind, a superb soundtrack, is acted adequately (folks are blasting the acting, it was fine) and a simple plot (folks are calling the plot thin and its sort of true but it didn't need a complex plot ala INCEPTION.) Go see this film on the big screen. Zack Snyder delivers what was promised. If you like Zack Snyder, this film is right up your alley. If you don't like Snyder's previous work then you're going to hate this. <br/><br/>I don't get the folks complaining about the acting and dialog. Will these actors win Oscars; not at all.

","When I saw the trailers for this film, it seemed very ""STRANGE"" & likely to be very ""confusing"" & ""silly""... After seeing the whole movie, I must say I was RIGHT in my instincts...<br/><br/>... I will try to give you the ""plot""-- but, be warned, it will not make much ""sense""-- which ALSO is pretty ""accurate"": ... Baby Doll (EMILY BROWNING) lives in a creepy house-- with an even creepier Stepfather (GERARD PLUNKETT). He's a predator, attacks her & her sister after their mother dies, &, when she ""resists"" him, he puts her in a MENTAL asylum for women...<br/><br/>... That place is run by an evil self-centered young shark named Blue Jones (OSCAR ISAAC), who wants to sink his ""teeth"" (& other areas) into Emily (& possibly other inmates there)...<br/><br/>... He brings Emily to the ""Theater"" area (named because it IS a stage-filled theater), which is run by an Eastern European woman named Dr. Vera Gorski (CARLA GUGINO). She believes she can ""rehabilitate"" the women (tho, to ""what"" is debatable) by the use of ""DANCE"" moves-- tho almost no one truly ""dances"" there...<br/><br/>... One of the primary members of the non-dancing ""company"" is Sweet Pea (ABBIE CORNISH), who dotes on her younger sister named Rocket (JENA MALONE) there... They both try to help Emily avoid a LOBOTOMY planned for her by Oscar, & they do that in part by encouraging her to join their ""DANCING"" group...<br/><br/>... Lots of people (including Oscar) are ""mesmerized"" by Emily's ""dancing""-- which involves merely TALKING about dancing & just ""standing"" there as she enters what the film company conveniently calls an ""ALTERNATE REALITY"", supposedly as a means of ""coping"" with the tribulations of the place...<br/><br/>... In that (ahem) ""reality"", she starts ""transporting"" to various WARTIME scenes, always ""led"" by a ""Wise Man"" (SCOTT GLENN)...<br/><br/>... First, as shown by the double-and-triple winged fighter aeroplanes, she's in WORLD WAR I with Abbie, Jena, & other of the inmate girls such as Blondie (VANESSA HUDGENS) and Amber (JAMIE CHUNG)...<br/><br/>... In appropriately ""washed-out"" colors and black & white, the women are transformed into great FIGHTERS, trying to destroy the wicked steam-powered ""zombies"" of the German KAISER... They attack his troops, aeroplanes and dirigibles, sometimes ""flying"" thru the air as they ""MOW-DOWN"" their adversaries...<br/><br/>... Does this sound like a ""COMIC BOOK"" type story? Well, it's SUPPOSED to!-- it's a ""graphic novel"" type of movie, directed (& partly written) by ZACK SNYDER, the maker of ""DAWN OF THE DEAD"" (from 2004), ""300"" (from 2006), ""WATCHMEN"" (2009), and ""LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS: THE OWLS OF GA'HOOLE"" (2010)!...<br/><br/>... In ""between"" the various ""wars"", the girls meet various other dastardly types, such as The Cook of the asylum (MALCOLM SCOTT), the Mayor (ALAN C. PETERSON), etc. There are planes representing WORLD WAR II, then some other war (possibly Vietnam, as characterized by the helicopters) & various ""fantastical"" CREATURES the girl inmates have to challenge and conquer...<br/><br/>... In the midst of all these clearly CONFOUNDING confrontations (including facing fire-breathing DRAGONS), Emily & the other girls have to go on a ""QUEST"" to try to find & recover 5 special ""objects"" which (per Scott) will supposedly help them ESCAPE the asylum...<br/><br/>... At one point, we meet a kindly ""Doctor"" (JON HAMM), who doesn't like the idea of lobotomizing Emily. WHY is he there in the story?-- Well, either because he's a ""BIG NAME"" TV star, or they wanted to have one ""positive"" male figure (or for ""BOTH"" and possibly other insignificant reasons!)...<br/><br/>... Is one of the girls a ""double-agent"" secretly working on behalf of the ASYLUM masters, & if so, who IS it?... Will any of the girls be killed in the plans to try to escape?... Will any of the ""SINFUL"" characters get their ""just desserts"" (or at least ""entrees"")?!...<br/><br/>... At the end of my advance screening, one person in the audience loudly yelled a hearty ""BOO!"" at what he'd just seen (which caused a bunch of laughs & some cries of ""agreement"") with his opinion...<br/><br/>... Is the film ridiculous?-- ABSOLUTELY-- but, it's clearly MEANT to be!... It's ""cartoonish"", makes little sense, & (as I said at the beginning), it's a ""MISH-MOSH"" of ideas that are seemingly meant to LOOK ""impressive"" (& that's about ""all"" it achieves)....<br/><br/>... The film is undeniably ""CREATIVE"", with some quite striking SPECIAL EFFECTS (cgi & otherwise), done by a number of different special effects groups... I'm trying to ""resist"" saying you're a ""SUCKER"" if you let the the theater ""PUNCH"" your ticket to see this...<br/><br/>... But, because I LIKE attempts at being imaginative, I am going to ""generously"" rate the film at 6.0 out of 10 stars. I can't give it more because, while the acting is OK & it's ""creative"" in parts, it's got some dreadful dialogue & writing, & it is NOT what I'd call ""inspired"" in what to me is any particularly ""worthwhile"" way...<br/><br/>[... One thing as a serious aside: most people left the theater when the CREDITS were just starting to play. Sit THRU the credits-- because only there will you see real DANCING, & the 5 minutes or so of musical numbers are done in a finely STYLISH way that's really the BEST part of the film, in my opinion!...]"

Or possibly it didn't really get better, I just shut down part of my brain and the film actually became rather entertaining at that point. The film is all about visuals, robotic German warriors, far eastern samurai monsters, dragons, big guns, bigger guns, swords, knives, explosions, and so on and so forth. Plus of course an excuse to see pretty girls dressed in manga inspired Japanese console fighting game outfits, which leave both too little and too much for the imagination. And it's clear that the film makers have had bucketfuls of imagination - all of this running rampant throughout the flick. I honestly wish they had had just a little bit more control over that, but as a film it truly is one of a kind. Hot girl factor 10 points, story 1 point, explosions and special effects 8 points.

","Its become a trend for Hollywood movies to plant a psychological theme in their films, be it Inception, or The Invasion etc; every other film questions life and its 'meaning'. In films like 'American Beauty' the message is too clear, while its covered more subtly in others. Sucker Punch takes an aberrant route, and fails miserably in both the clarity and impact of the movie. The main problem is the jarring action sequences, which I happily skipped towards the end because of the inanity of the guns and the machines. <br/><br/>The plot itself is convoluted, flabby and sloppy. Baby Doll lands in the asylum, where she is to undergo lobotomy. In order to 'escape', she needs 5 items, and for this she has to dance like a stripper (in her fantastical world). This dance takes her to another realm, where she and her b----es fight ugly contraptions. Whatever.<br/><br/>The unwatchability of the film is its main flaw. There's so much going on and its all stupid. The mental asylum and the go-go girl story would have been fine, but then there are Arnold Schwaggeneger routines too. Seriously, I would've been fine with the sensual dance itself. The acting is good, but I really could not take anyone seriously. All wanted to sound as if they were in some art film, especially the Russian psychiatrist. But I seriously question the 'art' behind the film. The end seems too clichéd, like some eighties' movie with Linda Blair. <br/><br/>Sucker Punch to me is a sucked out punch that barely lands. It's a bad film that's taking itself too seriously. To me, it would've been a whole lot better sans the lengthy action scenes. 2/10"

","So dumb it compelled me to make an IMDb account to write this review...<br/><br/>I figured that a fantasy/action movie where schoolgirl babes fight dragons and reanimated Nazis would be light, mindless entertainment. But this flick is straight up boring. There was no pacing, it was (I think a few have pointed this out before) just like a video game. On each level, the girls have to steal some object. Each time, Baby Doll distracts the bad guys with a burlesque dance so the other chicks can grab the it. Each time, the dance takes them one level deeper in the dream, where a dude first briefs them on their mission, which each time is an ultra-saturated slow-mo action sequence fighting some magical enemy. (Besides dragons and Nazis, I think they also fight giant samurais.) They go back to the top-level dream, of course having succeeded. Repeat four times. Wake from the original dream, something something, done. There isn't even any suspense or dramatic irony about the characters' relation to the dream world.<br/><br/>I kind of like the Watchowski-brothers-meets-tom-of-Finland, fetish-light motif of Zack Snyder's movies. But in the end they are all just garbage. Totally cynical, lazy and disappointing."

","So, where DO I start? the ""meh"" effects? the awful story? the unreliable characters? the horrible acting? So many choices, not enough words to fill this review, so I'll summer it up for you:<br/><br/>Sucker punch, is a mix of a few successful video-games and epic movies, mashed together into a high budget, effect packed, waste of your money.<br/><br/>We had some Lord of the rings, a bit of matrix, a bunch of Call of duty, Devil may cry, Bayonetta, and I definitely got some Memoirs of a geisha vibe every other scene.<br/><br/>Now, you might think for your self: ""Well that sounds like fun!"", but no, you are wrong, oh, so wrong.<br/><br/>When there is too much of everything, everything smells funny. you can't cover up the stench with so many effects, it simply doesn't work. the story was so lame I simply lost all interest half way through, I just waited for the effects to save the day, which they didn't. at some point I lost hope and just waited for it to end, which (it felt), didn't.<br/><br/>The trailer was so promising, that I just had to see it for my self, and as you might realize, if you got all the way here, it disappointed me to say the least. I don't usually rate movies, I just move on...<br/><br/>But I just had to share my disappointment with the world, or else I'd have problems falling asleep tonight.<br/><br/>I felt as if I was being laughed at my face, when one of the characters said: ""Don't ever write a check with your mouth you can't cash with your ass."" true, so true."

I'll be kind and highlight it's spectacular action sequences, some brilliant costumes and spot on scenery, good enough to rival anything I've ever seen, and it's amazing soundtrack which fits in among the chaos perfectly. Never has a film brought out the Jeckyll and Hyde more in me, I'm torn, but ultimately I can't shake the fact that at it's core Sucker Punch is a total mess and could have been oh so special. <br/><br/>Basically Sucker Punch is like THE food fight of all food fights, it's messy, totally unnecessary buts it's quite good fun."

I really wanted to see something else, however my friend really wanted to see this. So, I went in expecting it to be quite bad to be honest. From start to end though I was glued! It had a great storyline (if you could pick up on it as it can be confusing at first).<br/><br/>Basically, I loved this film and I am so glad I went to see it. However, my friend who actually wanted to see it thought it was rubbish and not worth going to see. So, although I do personally think it is great, I don't think that everyone will love it. If you are going to see it for great action scenes constantly throughout then this film is not for you. It has a great storyline and it takes us through it however you have to be willing to be taken along with it, otherwise you will not enjoy it.<br/><br/>I would recommend people to go and see it, just make sure you are willing to actually watch it."

","Before I watched Sucker Punch I felt this film could either be a load of garbage or a masterpiece. Thank god it wasn't garbage.<br/><br/>The special effects are just phenomenal, the story fantastic, the action is crazy and the girls are hot hot hot. On that note don't for one second think this is just a blokes film, yes it's full of flawlessly gorgeous looking girls and makes great eye candy but it is the story that is the key to its success.<br/><br/>You have got to be open minded to enjoy Sucker Punch as it takes a straight forward story and implements two further versions of itself. Very hard to describe without spoiling the film but it keeps you absolutely mesmarised the entire way from start to finish.<br/><br/>The trailers may have you thinking this is an action film along the lines of dungeons and dragons or final fantasy however it is actually a very dark portrayal of a young girls battle against time and is all centred around abuse, betrayal, deceit, manipulation and just the sheer will to survive.<br/><br/>When I left the cinema after watching Sucker Punch I actually said to my friend that I hadn't made my mind up if I liked it or not. It's hard to explain but I found myself playing the film over and over in my head that night and realised the more I thought about it the more I loved it.<br/><br/>One thing I will say however is you have to see this film on the big screen, I feel that it might not come across as well on DVD as it is just mind blowing. Yes it isn't an action film, it's primarily a drama/thriller however it probably has MORE action in it than any action film out there!!!!

"reospeed1","5","3","7","1 April 2011"," WAY over hyped in Trailer
","I went to see this movie purely for the action sequences and special effects based on the trailer. I ignored the IMDb rating of less than a 7.0 and spent my money at a movie theater to see it ANYway. Bad move. The movie story is drawn out--they have to get 5 things to get out of the asylum. It takes almost the entire movie just to get 3 of them and all of the fighting sequences are just fluff between this story line. They have absolutely no purpose to the actual characters or story line in that they don't further the real life story. Instead, you just get to go into her dream life while she's being ""used/sexually enslaved."" After the second item is captured, these ""going into her alter ego/mind"" got very old, very quick. Too bad that only got us to 2 of the 5 items they needed to get out. We still had 3 more left?!!? Sheesh.<br/><br/>Lesson learned--don't ignore IMDb's ratings. I was hoping for more--I went to see Avatar JUST for the action and effects; not the lame story line and I thoroughly enjoyed that movie. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for Sucker Punch. The action scenes weren't good enough to overcome such a deplorable story line. The real irony is that the sucker punch is, the actual movie. The first punch is the price of a movie ticket. The sucker punch is giving you a crappy movie after paying so much. BLAH! And the whole story being about women who are being held as sex slaves/forced prostitution--really? It was just too dark and depressing of a story line which D R U G on and onnnnnnnnnnnn. Blyeahgh! Thumbs down!!!! Who wants to watch stuff about fake sex slaves when we see it all the time in the news these days. It's bad enough that it happens in real life. I don't want to have to pay money to go see a movie based on it.<br/><br/>There were a FEW good action sequences. But how many times can a woman do twists in the air to avoid being shot by a bullet? I counted 3 in one sequence. 3! Think of a different move already. It was overplayed beFORE the FIRST time you saw it in this movie (thanks to several other movies including the likes of Kung Fu Panda for goodness sakes)."

","Similar to the film ""Life of Pi"" expropriated with characters that act as avatars for the real world, and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"" for the finale. Sucker Punch is filled in-between with a CGI wonderland. Although seemingly anti abuse (male onto female), the context remains one of pleasuring the male ego. Disturbing because of the hopelessness and destitution of the female characters, held together by male infantile and juvenile save-the-world arcade game sequences. All the men gain their pleasures despite their eventual negative outcomes. La petite mort become la grand mort but still a climax for the men. Disturbing on many levels."

","(Not Recommended) That sound you might here in the distance may be the ka-ching of the cash register as this film rakes in millions from unsuspecting moviegoers, or the grumbling from a disapproving audience of movie fans in love with graphic novel adaptations and video games. Yes, the latest loud, crass, and bombastic film from Zack Snyder, Sucker Punch ( with an emphasis on the first syllable, I might add ), has now entered the movie arena and you have now been officially warned! So prepare yourself if you choose to attend its screening for two full hours of utter nonsense or wisely avoid this movie at all costs if you have any common sense ( which the film itself sorely lacks ).<br/><br/>The lame brained plot is a mere outline of a film without a real script. Meet Babydoll, ( Emily Browning ) who befriends Sweet Pea ( Abbie Cornish ), Rocket ( Jena Malone ), Blondie, whose a brunette ( Vanessa Hudgens ), and Amber ( Jamie Chung ). All of the actors overdo their roles and deserve better material than this.<br/><br/>This miserable and senseless onslaught of mayhem is meant to be camp, but it lacks any real wit or humor. Sucker Punch is the equivalence of visual static. It's a series of music videos strung together posing as a coherent movie. Highly influenced in the Michael Bay School of Filmmaking, the film is full of noise, explosions, gunfire, and crashes. ( I would be amiss if I didn't state that the film's director, Zack Snyder, does have a strong visual sense of filmmaking. He keeps the action sequences moving at a quick pace, except for his overuse of anachronistic pop songs and slo-mo effects. But it is his writing skills that are also old- fashioned and lazy, desperately in need a reboot. He's become a poor man's David Lynch with a nod to Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill. )<br/><br/>His film aspires to be just a teenage fan boy fantasy, a movie display of female eye candy who fight Nazi zombies, dragons, robots, and other Gameboy obstacles, dispensing justice with cutting edge swords and state of the arts computer effects. Sadly, Snyder has more to offer than this pap.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is a bloated mash-up of violence, action, and sex ( in descending order). The film has no redeeming value except for its visual kinetic style which put me in sensory overload within the first half hour. Sucker Punch will affront your senses and leave you breathless with its boldness and audacity. It certainly reinforced its title claim for anyone who comes near this film mess ( with an emphasis on the first word, I might add ). It is undoubtedly one of the worst films of this year.

"dvc5159","5","5","15","24 March 2011"," Zack Snyder lets his complete vision out... with mixed results
","""Sucker Punch"" is a difficult movie to rate. It is targeted at young males who have a penchant for anime, video games, and hot young girls kicking ass. In other words, Zack Snyder's imagination and childhood fantasies are completely let loose here, with mixed results.<br/><br/>First off, hats off to Zack Snyder. His world is completely warped. With this being his first original film (the previous others were all adaptations of other works), he unleashes an array of stimulating and sensational visual effects and action sequences the way he normally does so solidly.<br/><br/>Secondly, anyone expecting proper characterization and a coherent story will walk out half-an-hour into the movie.<br/><br/>The story may look stupid on the outside, and believe me it does, but after paying close attention I noticed a real psychological trait running throughout the entire film's duration. There are aspects which are metaphorical and will keep you guessing what is really happening throughout. Although the story is shaped in a very incoherent and unnatural way, it never fully reaches its potential and the psychological aspect pales in comparison with other brilliant films like Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" and ""Inception"".<br/><br/>Thirdly, some of the material may be too dark for it's PG-13 rating, and there is no easy solutions to solve these dark themes. The change of tone between this and its fantasy theme is ultimately very jarring indeed and can cause a lot of viewers to be turned off.<br/><br/>The action sequences, however are very stylized and extravagantly done. It is clear that a lot of thought has been put into the action. Snyder utilizes well-rendered computer-generated visual effects to great use, and the camera work and editing allow the audience to savor the effects and appreciate them. But there are times where the action becomes very overdone, and it drags on too loud and some scenes which have no purpose being there, thus bogging down the pacing too.<br/><br/>The actresses look great and sexy, but in some scenes they show some surprising vulnerability beneath all of those good looks. The supporting cast is good too, most notably Oscar Isaac as the main villain, and it's nice to see Scott Glenn on the big screen again.<br/><br/>My main gripe comes with the music and sound effects, sometimes they're obnoxiously loud and forced, and they make some moments look out of place in the film. Tyler Bates and Marius De Vries may have put a lot of combinations of music in this film, but sometimes one's got to know that too much of a good thing is bad.<br/><br/>No doubt many people will hate this film. Also, not many people may notice the psychological aspect (it was only hinted at in the trailers) running throughout the film, making them think that it's an all out action-fantasy film instead of an action-adventure that takes place in the mind. The film's faults make this Zack Snyder's weakest film thus far, but it is still miles away from ever being called an abomination. The tagline is true, ""you will be unprepared"", and as I enjoyed the visuals but was puzzled by the story and its resolution, I find this to be not just brainless entertainment on the surface. It may be Snyder's weakest, but it is nonetheless interesting.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is a warm-up, or the release of Snyder's mind, to prepare him for that ""Superman"" project with Christopher Nolan.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 65/100"

But I really felt like punching Director Zack Snyder, and it's was the best way to describe what I felt after watching this movie. It really sucks, if I am allowed to use this word on this forum. (Sorry if I'm not)<br/><br/>The script is a mix between any of the dark Tim Burton's animated films and a French movie like ""Last tango in Paris"", promising so much and giving a harsh and uncomfortable amount of disappointment. Somewhere when the film was running, I had the strange sense of reading a Hindu mythology book that gives a lot of hints but ultimately leading you nowhere.<br/><br/>I'm so sorry I have wasted my time, instead of watching a master piece of film just like ""Citizen Kane""."

","First of all, I have to get this off my chest, why the hell is Vanessa Hudgens' character named Blondie? She is not a blonde! Now that I have vented, on to business.<br/><br/>I read many reviews about this movie, most panning it, and I should have paid attention. This movie has three different worlds within it, and that really serves no purpose other than to muddle the plot (for example, in the club/brothel setting, Amber and Blondie get shot, it is never explained what actually happens to them). The action scenes, in particular, are gratuitous and incongruous. They would have been excellent in a different kind of movie; but here, they just do not mesh. I would have probably tolerated, and maybe even enjoyed the movie, had those been taken out (and I am sure they are a sizable chunk of the budget) and replaced with expansions on either of the two other planes of existence, instead of anime style action porn (the overuse of bullet time in a lot of current action films almost makes me wish that The Matrix had never been made).<br/><br/>In addition, I am sure I will not be the first, nor the last to point out that the overuse of blue and orange filters, AND lens flare in films is REALLY starting to get annoying. There are probably infinite ways to be visually creative in film, showing people a slightly different version of what everybody else is doing is trite.<br/><br/>Some of the anachronisms also bothered me quite a bit. I will discount the action scenes, altogether, since I think they were probably only there to draw a younger demographic; but the music in the club/brothel scenes does not at all fit in with the 60's setting of the real story, none of it.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a movie that deals with the serious themes of this movie, watch One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which is much better than this dross. If you want anime style action, that is a whole genre. I just watched the first Gantz live action movie, inspired by the manga of the same name, and it was pretty good, although on some points I wish it had stayed closer to the original (I'm holding off on the second movie because I want to get caught up to that point on the manga first); but as much as the action in Gantz is over the top, it is still way more believable than the action scenes in Sucker Punch.<br/><br/>Altogether, this movie tried too hard to breach an unsurmountable gap. It could have been a decent psychological drama; or a decent popcorn action movie; but in the end it is better to wholeass one thing than to halfass a bunch of them, and this movie halfassed it all the way. I give it one star for copying One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest too much on the main theme that I could have let it skate by on, and yet screwing even THAT up by hitting you over the head too much with the message (Whatever happened to subtlety?)."

","After attempting to shoot her abusive stepfather, but accidentally killing her sister instead, blonde hottie Babydoll (Emily Browning) is sent to a home for the mentally insane where dear old step-daddy pays a member of staff to organise a lobotomy for the traumatised girl. In the five days leading up to the operation, Babydoll plans to escape with the help of several equally attractive female inmates (played by Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung), but repeatedly retreats into an elaborate, make-believe realm to help her cope with her situation.<br/><br/>Director Zack Snyder was the man responsible for the historically inaccurate, CGI-laden, homo-erotic movie adaptation of Frank Miller's '300', which bored the hell out of me thanks to an over-reliance on CGI effects, the absence of anything resembling a decent plot, waaay too much slow motion, and the fact that buffed-up Spartans really aren't my thing.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch thankfully replaces the lightly oiled pectorals and abs with tantalising shots of scantily clad babes (an exposed thigh here, a bare midriff there), but still suffers from a glut of digital trickery (to realise Babydoll's amazingly detailed, steampunk-styled, imaginary world), a total lack of substance, and Snyder's continual misguided belief that playing out matters at half-speed (to the strains of a dreadful emo-goth-pop soundtrack) somehow lends emotional gravitas or dramatic intensity to proceedings. Also a major detraction is the fact that at no point during the film are the girls ever in real danger, all of the incredible action—the battles against stone samurai, zombie Nazis and fire breathing dragons—only ever occurring in the mind of Babydoll.<br/><br/>But perhaps most irritating thing of all about Sucker Punch are Snyder's desperate attempts to disguise the film as anything other than the masturbatory fantasy it so obviously is, the thin veneer of female empowerment, confusing 'dreamworlds-within-a-dreamworld' set-up, and emo-friendly themes of sacrifice and redemption not fooling this viewer for a second."

Zack instead of making a straight-forward movie about a girl trying to escape a mental institute,he decided to take a twisted approach to the whole plot and made it more action oriented mixed with many unwanted twists.... The plot started to become more and more mundane just after the scene where baby-doll is enrolled in the institute.. I loved Zack's style,especially his trademark slow-mo and closeups but the multiple and repetitive action scenes drained the interest in those effects from me....

","I loved 300. I adored Watchmen. I really wanted to at least like Sucker Punch, but alas, that was not to be.<br/><br/>First, I'm a woman, so seeing chicks prance around in thigh-highs fishnet stockings and slutty schoolgirl uniform (which I find rather creepy) doesn't do anything for me. Sorry, but after a while, my main thought was 'less boobs, more scenario/dialogue/anything please' Second: the music was gorgeous, but with the admittedly impressive CGI fights and overly pretty images, well, it felt like an outrageously long MTV music video. Note that I wouldn't make that complaint about 300, because the fights there were not as repetitive as in Sucker Punch. Because let's face it, the fights here are boring. It's like playing Tomb Raider 1: there is a set number of moves, and that's it.<br/><br/>Also, the orcs at the medieval fortress... Ripping off Lord of the Rings make up style much? Don't get me wrong, Sucker Punch is bad-ass. Steam-powered zombie Nazis... life probably can't get much better.<br/><br/>But a scenario might have been nice. Better (less awful) dialogues, too.<br/><br/>Also, why on earth does the first level of the girl's fantasy world have to be a bordello? That's pretty gratuitous, at least in my opinion.<br/><br/>Moreover: I went to see this expecting a bad-ass girl-power ass-kicking fest. That is not what I got. If I want girl-power, I'll go back to watching the awesome Ripley in Alien and Aliens, because those pretty girls all dolled up (in the sluttiest get-ups)? That's not girl power, that's the chick fantasizing herself as she should be to attract the male gaze. Because we're supposedly in the girl's imagination, right? And she's that innocent, virginal 20-year old, so how come her dream self and her friends look like they stepped out of a dirty magazine? (and why the bordello, dammit??) And anyone else feeling a burning desire to slap that doe-eyed, 'why me?', uncomprehending look off the protagonist's face, raise your hands, please.<br/><br/>Anyway,I guess guys (at least some of them) might find that movie interesting as softcore porn/gaming footage.

","I am glad I did not simply fall for the bad reviews against this film ""Sucker Punch."" Actually there was unbelievable hype going for this Zach Snyder film building up to its theater debut. However, as the movie opened, bad reviews unexpectedly started to pour in about how bad it was! I almost was not able to watch at all in the movie house, until this week. And I am glad that I did catch it. <br/><br/>While it may seem that the target may be the young male audiences because of its cool look, sexy girls, big weapons and violent scenes, the deeper message of the entire movie would seem to target the young females. The film exhorts young women to stand their ground and fight for their rights. However, it also sends the not-so-subtle message to these young ladies that this would not be an easy task in this world, as our heroines needed to escape into their dreams in order to escape their harsh realities in a world of bad men.<br/><br/>This type of movie has to be seen in the big screen to appreciate its full effect. The CGI is awesomely executed in that cool anime style to bring us to diverse locales, from asylum to brothel to Oriental temples to WWI trenches. There is even a fire-breathing dragon in there somewhere. While the female leads are young, pretty and sexy, although acting may not really be their top suits. The plot is very intricate where there are multiple layers of reality and fantasy which involve many characters, so much so that the ending is very open for interpretation. I do not know exactly why people hated this film. I think it does its job very well. It is actually quite entertaining and delivered in a very artistic cinematic style."

What's this? When she dances she closes her eyes and ends up in a fantasy world.... cue action sequences that have no bearing on the plot. This goes on for a long time. Then we find out she's been lobotomised and the entire film is all in her head. The end.<br/><br/>""Well"" I thought to myself ""That was a big kick in the teeth"" The sad thing is it really could have worked but in order to give us the kick in the teeth ending of ""it was all a dream"" much of the direction, script and plot is misleading, contradictory and completely pointless. I don't see why this movie is being raved about by some. It's got nothing going for it but a great trailer made from all the action sequences that have no bearing on the plot at all."

","Going in, I knew that the main character was going into a fantasy world from the previews. I liked the concept. The problem I had was the execution. The thing that bugged me most was the ""double"" fantasy. By this, I mean, she went into a fantasy world, then went into another. If they stayed with reality, then went into the fantasy fighting scenes, I would have liked the film. Leaving the theater, I wasn't sure what actually happened in reality. Maybe that was the intent, but it didn't work for me. The second thing that bugged me was the weapons. It is 1955. Even in a fantasy world, you wouldn't have the weapons that would not be invented in another 40 plus years. Even futuristic comic books didn't have these weapons. As far as the acting goes, I was not as disappointed as others have been. The main character killed her sister. Something that would leave anybody in a zombie state. My main question leaving the theater.... Were those 3 girls killed, or was it fantasy?"
"Vinegaroon3","2","4","11","30 March 2011"," Very bad movie, actually offensive in many ways.
","Where to begin? A few of the ""positive"" reviews on IMDb made vague references that this was a ""deep"" film, with complex underlying meaning. I call baloney.<br/><br/>This movie in my opinion would only appeal to either 15 year old virginal male video game players, or to older males who are stuck in that period of development. When this film ended, I almost felt sort of ""lessened"" because I had sat through the movie and paid to see it.<br/><br/>The film makes no sense, it was just a jumbled excuse to combine scantily clap ""attractive"" young women with video game special effects. In this film, the only people of any worth or merit were the scantily clad young women (all of them attractive of course) who featured in it. And of course the film did nothing but exploit their appearance....<br/><br/>The only reason I did not give the movie a ""1"", was because some of the effects were slightly interesting in a ""video game put on film"" sort of way.<br/><br/>I don't want to take a lot of time trying to explain why this film was so bad. Trust me, it is bad, it is an insult to the intelligence of the viewer, and if you sit through it you will feel slightly ""dirty"" when you leave.

","Although i'm not a huge fan of Zack Snyder's previous works (Watchmen,300, and Dawn of the Dead) i have to say i did enjoy the film. <br/><br/>You have to know you are gonna find a film full of pop culture references. For example, Charlie's Angels, Moulin Rouge, scenes that seem to be taken from a Quentin Tarantino film(specially Kill Bill) or a Peter Jackson production(LOTR). For instance, the part were Baby Doll must escape from a dragon looks like a mix between Peter Jackson's LOTR and Mike Newell's Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The film is also very influenced by Japanese anime and manga. The most clear example is the costume of Baby Doll.<br/><br/>Some people may find weird the way Zack Snyder combines the reality, sub-reality and the fantasy world of a 20 years old girl who leads a team that tries to run away from a psychiatric center in the early 60's. In the way they would have to travel through all kind of different worlds, and fight all kinds of creatures, from steampunk soldiers to futuristic robots!<br/><br/>Even though the plot is pretty simple its impossible to predict whats gonna happen in the following sequence because all the time Snyder surprises you with even a craziest scene, helped by pretty realistic CGI animation.<br/><br/>Maybe its not a film for everybody, but if you liked Snyder previous works you will enjoy this fantasy-action film that seems taken from a bizarre Japanese comic!<br/><br/>What did i like most? The way the soundtrack(specially at the very beginning) complements the story.<br/><br/>What did i hate most? Maybe its too long, probably i would cutoff some minutes, in particular some action parts."

","This movie got pretty crappy reviews. I mean I only watched because my friend forced me to watch it with her because she loved it. But, I surprisingly loved it too.<br/><br/>I found the story line hauntingly beautiful. Yes, it was out there, but I actually think the film married all the differing elements extremely well. I was completely immersed in the story from start to finish and felt deeply about the characters. I thought the action was great, the CGI wasn't incredible but whatever. <br/><br/>I think this film gets a bad wrap because it is overwhelming in nature. The fantasy action sequences which seemingly happen within our protagonist's mind are kind of random. However, i think instead it was an incredible showing of how strong she was as a character in spirit. Instead of watching her dance (presumingly sexually) on front of paying men, we watched her defeat fantastical enemies in her mind. Metaphorically I think she was defeating the inner demons of her mind. <br/><br/>Completely underrated film, would highly recommend. Your motto when watching this film should be ""just go with it"". Don't overthink it or scrutinise it. Watch it, then review it."

","After accidentally killing her sister, Babydoll is sent to a mental institution where her life is about to get as worse as it can. In order to detach from her state of depression, she comes up with a dance which almost hypnotizes everyone and brings her hope of evading that awful place.<br/><br/>It's an interesting premise with a great idea of evading reality presented in a spectacular way and accompanied by thrilling and heart pumping music. While the fictional part was top notch, I can't say the same about the real one. It had its flaws with the beginning and its rather unconvincing and unsatisfying finale (although it was unexpected). I recommend it especially for the awesome combat and explosions rather that for its story."
"De_Sam","8","2","4","30 July 2017"," A defence for ambition in filmmaking
","There has never been a better example of the need to have as little prior knowledge before watching a film as an indispensable requirement to enjoy said film. <br/><br/>Firstly, try for a moment to imagine having heard none of Zack Snyder's ridiculous notion that Sucker Punch is an empowering feminist work; it increased the scrutiny regarding the plot devices he used, which led to all those who rightly deemed that revenge rape story lines are completely unrelated to female empowerment. When just viewed as a story on its own, then I feel most fail to see the balance (or at least as close as you can get to that concept given Snyder's aesthetic) Sucker Punch achieves in addressing topics of abuse in all kinds without shying away from the consequences and without exploiting the acts themselves to generate interest. In short, I had no problems with the story or in the way it was portrayed.<br/><br/>In addition, a lot of viewers have complained about the covers of some of their favourite songs, ranging from the Eurythmics' Sweet Dreams, Björk's Army of Me, Queen's We Will Rock You the Pixies' Where is my mind and the The Beatles' Tomorrow never knows. I for one hold no strong feelings for the original versions of these songs (would even go as far as to say those last two are better than their original versions, mainly because I dislike the Pixies and Beatles) and was pleasantly surprised by the apt selection of accompanying tracks to the varied action sequences.<br/><br/>Lastly, I saw the director's cut, which is mandatory for an ambitious and indulgent film such as Sucker Punch; if you go hard, than go all the way (the closest comparison I have in this regard is the overly absurd 功夫 (Kung Fu Hustle)). Maybe this version is more clear and understandable than the theatric version as I had no problem discerning the plot and all the thematic subtexts in one sitting.<br/><br/>I do have the feeling at times I was watching an extended in-game cut scene, but I did not mind it at all, because this lend itself to exploring a range of video game staples, namely Nazi Zombies (thanks Call of Duty: World at War) and a variety of Japanese anime tropes (especially the excessive panty flashing in the first action sequence).<br/><br/>If I had to summarise, I immediately accepted Snyder's intend with Sucker Punch and he had me intrigued from start to finish. Blame my soft spot for convoluted and pretentious story lines that thrive solely on minimal information delivery, because I quite liked the ending as well"
"blumdeluxe","7","2","4","14 March 2017"," Nice little Comic Action
","""Sucker Punch"" is mainly based on action. It tells the story of a young girl, who is sent to psychiatry by her cold-hearted stepfather and learns to stand up for herself and others through a parallel world she creates.<br/><br/>While it is surely not the greatest of its kind, the movie creates quite a nice atmosphere in my eyes, that makes it easy to arrive in the comic-like world the story is settled in. Though I'm not sure if the metaphors always work for me (I'm still kind of confused in how far who is involved and in charge), their concept surely is creative and, in a very simple conclusion, quite entertaining.<br/><br/>I do understand why some might dislike the film, it has its weaknesses and especially for people that are more familiar with this genre there probably is a lot to at least discuss controversially. Nonetheless I can say that for me this works well for an entertaining evening and if you don't hope for much more you won't be disappointed."

The story line is more about crazy situations than plot exactly, but the stunning visual effects more than make up for any plot holes. I would put this slightly ahead of ""Sin City"" and ""300""--also graphic novels--just for the visual effects and cinematography. The originality of the story earned it an extra star from me. There are a couple places where the story is disjointed, but overall it is complex. You can discuss the fine points of exactly what each person thinks really happened around the water cooler. Or, just watch it for the cheerleaders. Either way, it is worth seeing, worth seeing twice, and worth owning."

But one thing that is very rare, is a young person (the antagonist) having as much power and influence as the dude in this movie had. That is unheard of. I am sure the writer of the movie has just never been in the system before, or just knew he had to make the character young for the movie to work.<br/><br/>As u know, the girl has fantasies as a coping strategy as she decides to escape the looney bin. The story alternates between the fantasy viewpoint of her escape, and the real life version of the escape. <br/><br/>The movie is just strange. I get it, but I think the fantasy view was just too far fetched and irrelevant. The fantasy also left some questions unanswered. I think the general idea of the movie had potential, but it got lost somewhere in production.<br/><br/>This movie is better than people say. I think most people also aren't aware of how common psychosis and defense mechanisms are.

"pro_crustes","8","2","4","23 February 2013"," That looks so cool...
","Fabulous! By relying on tropes so familiar he doesn't need to contribute a story, Snyder justifies over-the-top visuals and gives us a gang of kick-ass warrior-women without one close-up shot of a bosom or one ripped skirt at the thigh. Think ""Aeon Flux"" and that style of ""cool,"" instead of ""Black Scorpion"" (and that style of trash), and you get what Snyder has to offer.<br/><br/>Drill down on the IMDb ratings and take note of the fact that, except for the IMDb staff, the highest rating comes from females under 18. A number of critics mistakenly dismissed this movie as being aimed at men, because the heroes (the right word for these women) wear a lot of black leather and fishnets. But look closer at what you _don't_ see: there's not a lot of bare skin, nor even much hinting at anything racy. In the ""club,"" they wear the same practice leotards every professional dancer has. In the fighting scenes, their outfits cover almost their entire bodies, and in ways that are no more demeaning than how most male action heroes are dressed. Closest thing I could see to adolescent fantasy stuff was one character's black leather nurse's cap, which frankly looks pretty jaunty, kind of like the winged cap of the Italian carabinieri. Amazing that the teen-aged young women seemed to get this, while the middle-aged female professional reviewers mostly missed it.<br/><br/>Extra fun for those of us who remember Scott Glenn for the similarly plot-less, equally atmospheric, ultimately inferior (though almost as satisfying) 1983's ""The Keep."" He is equally enigmatic here, though a bit more sly as he leaves the combat to the main characters.<br/><br/>Don't look for a story. Look for something you kind of partly wish were real, if only it weren't so likely to hurt you, and then say, ""Gee, that looks so _cool_!"" You'll be glad you did."

","Zach Snyder, the director behind films such as 300 and Watchmen is back with his new live-action movie, Sucker Punch. This movie has impressive visuals as all his films do, but sadly this movie lacks an effective story. It has a great premise and all, but the screenplay should have been written much better. Zach Synder needs to learn a lesson on how to properly tell a story but other than that, I did have a somewhat fun time watching this film.<br/><br/>This movie is about a girl who is submitted to a mental ward. She and a couple of other girls are forced to dance. When they dance, they leave reality for fantasy and they try to escape that mental asylum.<br/><br/>The acting is okay nothing worth commenting on. The characters are not that memorable even though the lead actors are quite beautiful. I do wish to say that Emily Browning has grown up a lot since her last big film, 2004's A Series of Unfortunate Events.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a movie that could and should have been much better. If the story was there, this would have been a great movie. I also really disliked the soundtrack. I could not stand the heavy-metal, headache-inducing music. But despite that, I did think there were good moments and I had a fun time for the most part. This is a film to watch if there is nothing else to watch. I rate this film 6/10."
"maximkong","9","2","4","18 November 2012"," Unexpectedly, it is as good as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest!
","It's rare to see another film of this genre (i.e. of action and pretty chicks) that qualifies to be listed in my movie/ favourites list.<br/><br/>Aside from its amazing graphics, the storyline and the way it is being carried out are consistent/on par with the best of very serious, thought-provoking movies. The negative ratings given to this movie were there because I believe the viewers did not understand the movie, which should be watched through a difference looking glass.<br/><br/>Anyone who paid attention to the plot and appreciate the purpose of the role of the dreams will realize that it did not need to be a full-blown sentimentalism, emotional trainwreck/depressing storyline and SuckerPunch does not intend to present complicated character developments as expected of 'real, serious movies' because it is not made that way.<br/><br/>There is no need for the actors to deeply colour the message with dramatic emotional acting performances. There are already tons of realistic psychological movies dealing with similar subjects very heavily, a fine example would be One flew over the cuckoo's Nest.<br/><br/>This is a story on people struggling to make things easier by escaping from reality. This is a story that intends to be purely focused on the characters' STATE OF MIND, and nothing else externally. The alternate realities themselves fulfil all those purposes; the realistic expectations that I would very much expect from a well-made thought-provoking film are also present in this one, but in a different way. This is a modern-version of One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, influenced by the structure of graphic novels and in particular, Japanese-manga style of storytelling. I am really stunned by Snyder's decision to present such an unorthodox ending which actually made me really happy to include this movie in my list. Such ending will definitely put many people off.<br/><br/>I did not expect it to be a tearjerker too. Such a movie, if we ignore the fact that the actors are Westerners, is fundamentally a serious Japanese anime/manga material because the structure and especially the storyline is made akin to it. The only flaw I would like to point out is that the plot is not sustainable enough to maintain its suspense towards the middle-end part of the story. The battle scenes on the train fell short of expectations as compared to the previous 'dreams'. It is not a flaw in terms of plot, but it is the CGI technical aspects that failed to catch up to the plot's demands. Fortunately towards the ending, no more CGI was necessary."
"the_wolf_imdb","9","2","4","30 September 2012"," Excellent... on a level that most of people will not see
","This movie is clearly ""love or hate"" type thing, but not for the reasons you would guess at the first sight. Many people will judge this movie unfavorably because they see it as a series of music videos. First: This is not necessarily bad thing. Second: It is very wrong to see this movie only as a series of music videos.<br/><br/>These ""music videos"" (dance / dream scenes) are very apparent, very dominant in the movie. They are really good as a ""teenage guy fantasies"", they are very well made, really bombastic looking. They are so dominant that many viewers will think this movie ""sucks"" because they will be annoyed by the idea that they are considered to be teenagers.<br/><br/>But these scenes are NOT important. What is important is the subtle story of a group of girls who plan to try to run from the institution where they are kept and abused. Even more, even not this story is important there, although this story of friendship and sacrifice is almost as good as The Shawshank Redemption. But The Shawshank Redemption is filmed with so obvious ""humanistic"" message that it is generally judged as ""great"" even when its characters are actually very flat and schematic.<br/><br/>What is the most important here is the message it is worth not to give up and fight even when your chances are slim. These girls are not ""invincible"", actually only one of them manages to escape, which makes this movie to be way, way more dark that most of typical ""prison break"" movies.<br/><br/>But as ""The Colonel"" character says, ""Defend yourself!"" (BTW Have you noticed this character? Do you see, how he connects all these ""loose scenes"" together? Please do not tell this movie has weak script! Actually it is very, very clever.) Most of the viewers will not probably ever see this elaborate plot - they will see only girls in mini skirts playing wit full auto weapons, katanas and killing ninjas, trolls and robots.

"brooklyn-gilmore","9","2","4","12 September 2012"," Sucker Punch to the Gut
","""Sucker Punch"" (2011) is a schizophrenic masterpiece. The masterminds of Sucker Punch, director Zack Snyder and writers Zack Snyder and Seve Shibuya, create a hyper-reality of a 20 year-old girl who is placed in a mental institution by her stepfather. Babydoll enters Lennox Hopsital for the Mentally Insane knowing she needs to find a way to escape in order to turn her stepfather into the authorities for her sister's death. In her alternate reality, she meets an Old Wise Man whom strategically explains how to escape the institution before she is given a lobotomy, ""a surgical incision to the frontal lobe of the brain that severs one or more nerve tracts.""<br/><br/>Set in the 1960s, this action/fantasy/adventure film grabs the viewer's attention instantly. As Babydoll enters her alternate reality, her coping mechanism to escape realism, the film aesthetically transforms Babydoll, a blonde, blue-eyed female, into a sexy animated dance character. Babydoll's Barbie stature uses her curves to distract the male administrators in the institution to gather five items that would be an integral entity to escape Lennox House for the Mentally Insane. Babydoll is able to find the confidence to put herself in font of ogling men from her envisioned dance instructor, Dr. Gorski.<br/><br/>Babydoll's quest risks more than her proved sanity of her sister's death. She confides in four other girls to aide in her distraction, and it's bewitching to know that in her attempt, lives are risked and tears are shedded for Babydoll's sacrifice.<br/><br/>The term sucker punch is relative; the meaning is different to everyone. However, Snyder's ""Sucker Punch"" is more expressive, elusive, and entertaining than most. Babydoll is being sucker punched first by her stepfather for covering his actions, and second by the institution for bribing Babydoll's stepfather to forge his signature to secure Babydoll's memory loss. As the audience sees Babydoll's transcendence into her alternate reality, the audience expects Babydoll to pull through. Just when the viewer's are lead into one direction believing this hyper-reality is her reality, a twist is in place when Snyder sneaks upon his audience and gives them a sucker punch into the transcendence of reality. The audience is then informed of Babydoll's sacrifice.<br/><br/>""Sucker Punch"" failed in comparison to ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules"" at the box office. ""Sucker Punch"" brought in $19.1 million while ""Rodrick Rules"" begged in $22.1. ""Sucker Punch"" was Snyder's worst live- action review. In part, by meshing more than one genre, action/fantasy/adventure along with drama, mental health, and gaming into one film single handedly is easy to misinterpret. The one thing that Snyder is able to convey through symbolism is the mental health status of schizophrenia."

","First of all I have to say that I liked the movie. The story was too flat, and too desperate in trying not to be flat. The moral of it felt forced to me, and the multiple layers of reality made it look like a crappy version of Inception. Yet the fight scenes were incredibly well done, and the visuals were very impressive as well.<br/><br/>The story is kind of stupid. A girl (Baby-Doll) is moved to a mental hospital because she kills her sister instead of her abusive stepfather. There she imagines that she is in this whorehouse and she has to dance for the High Roller. Whenever she dances her mind takes her to these fantastical worlds where she has to find these four objects to escape from the asylum. It's too complicated, it would've been a whole lot better if the story was only in the fantasy world. This ""the whole thing is just in your head"" crap wasn't needed.<br/><br/>The action sequences in this film were absolutely remarkable. The WWI fight scene with the bombed Notre-Dame and the steam-powered German zombie soldiers was amazing. These fantasy worlds Zack Snyder created were fantastic, he just should've executed his whole story in them, reducing the layers of reality to one. He is one of the best action directors, but he shouldn't be writing his own scripts.<br/><br/>All in all, Sucker Punch isn't a good movie, but it is well made and quite enjoyable in some parts."

There is no nudity in this film, when Emily Browning's skirt comes up while she's fighting you can clearly see she's wearing tennis pants, the only thing on show are stomachs, legs, and maybe two characters show some cleavage.<br/><br/>The movie is also not a ripoff of Inception, like someone stupidly said, because Inception has copied off of others. Nothing is original now, so what do you expect? I really enjoyed the CGI effects (especially the 'knife' mission) and I thought the acting was really good. Vanessa Hudgens was a little disappointing but she did have a pretty small role anyway.<br/><br/>I think people need to stop paying attention to the ratings on IMDb... because most of the time you're going to be let down. Just watch the movie, and if you like it, you like it. You can't have an opinion on something just because it has a low or high score for goodness."

"themuddoctor","Null","2","4","5 September 2011"," Pretensious, incoherent, hypocritical trash
","Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch is the kind of film that was designed purely to fulfill the fantasies of the G4 addicted gamers that creamed their shorts when they first saw sneak previews of it at Comic-Con. The film itself succinctly highlights a disturbing trend among the ever-popular subculture of geekdom: its rampant sexism and utter lack of imagination. This is one of the most unintelligible and brainless movies of recent years. The screenplay seems to have been constructed out of the fragmented thoughts and suggestions of a fifteen year-old video game addict with ADD.

","First of all, I will freely admit that SUCKER PUNCH looks great. There is a seamless mix between physical sets and computer animation, and both combined manage to give us various worlds that look spectacular and unlike anything you have seen before.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I don't have as much enthusiasm for the screenplay. For starters, there is barely a story here - most of the movie consists of the female protagonists looking for stuff on a list. And the characters aren't that well-written as well. All of the female protagonists pretty much come across as all the same, with only their physical looks differentiating them from each other. Scott Glenn, an actor I've admired in the past, is pretty much wasted here.<br/><br/>While I wouldn't call this a TERRIBLE movie, I do think it's kind of disappointing. If the movie had a richer story and richer characters, it would almost certainly have become an instant cult classic. As it is now, there's no compelling reason to seek it out. If you do watch it, pick a time when your expectations are not high and you are in the mood for visual candy."

"malmzor","Null","2","4","4 August 2011"," Decent action but not much more.
","I enjoyed this movie for what it was. I didn't expect an Oscar-winning story so I wasn't let down on that point. But when the title is ""Sucker Punch"" you really cant expect much more than an action film whose main audience is guys between 15-25.<br/><br/>As I am a huge fan of the visual style in 300 I thought that this would satisfy me as well. The scenes where they are in this fantasy world are nice too look at and all I still feel like it should have been more than the few times that they occurred. I also feel that the first of these scenes set the bar to high and the rest of the movie couldn't reach that level. But that is probably because I'm a huge fan of those kinds of movies.<br/><br/>So for the plot, and I am trying to give away as little as possible. There are five girls trying to escape from a facility. I can't say much about the girls as they are all stereotypical and not original at all;<br/><br/>1. The older one who needs to be the center of attention. <br/><br/>2. The younger sister of that girl who wants to make her own decision. <br/><br/>3. The new girl who is taking the attention away from the previous center of attention. <br/><br/>4. The two girls that does what they are told and isn't a major part of the story.<br/><br/>Also you don't feel any connection to the characters. This is something I don't like in movies because when something happens to the character you don't care. The girls mission is to collect five objects that they will need to escape from the facility. It is when the girls are trying to collect these items that you see the action scenes. Sounds weird? Well thats because it is. As they are getting the items in real life we see it all happen in the main-character Ambers imagination. What you see in the fantasy represents things that actually happens, and because you know that it all her fantasy you can enjoy the action scenes for what they are and not think about how unreal they are. The villain of this story is Blue Jones played by Oscar Isaac and he does an amazing job. He is smart (but not too smart), cold-hearted, manipulative and creepy. He is definitely doing the best performance in this movie and I would say that he is one of the best villains I've seen in recent films. For the rest of the cast I really can't say that much. It's not great but it's not bad either.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people will try to find some meaning in this movie, other than the fact that your fantasy can be a tool for coping great sorrow. But the story didn't touch me enough to make me think about it as the movie went on and trying to analyze the deeper meaning of Sucker Punch in after hand is probably a waste of time.<br/><br/>If you have nothing better to do an evening and you just want to watch something fun I would definitely recommend this movie. But not more than that as it's not a movie you'll want to watch twice."

","This review definitely contains spoilers! I find it interesting how many reviews call this movie flat, one-dimensional, girl-in-god-mode, etc.<br/><br/>First, when you tally up the body count at the end, it's just not a very effective god-mode. So that's an incorrect assessment.<br/><br/>Next, why do the characters do what they do? Say what they say? At the base level, Baby Doll is in an insane asylum. The next higher level, she's trapped in a brothel. In the third, she is the new archetype: the sexy bad-ass chick.<br/><br/>Okay, so the fighting in the highest level is Baby Doll's way of emotionally coping with dancing. A way to express her anger, humiliation, passion and fear. Which in turn drives her body to express that. But this is the third level...<br/><br/>So the dancing is covering up, what? What is she really doing on the base level? <br/><br/>My guess is that your mind leaped to the answer and then sprung back a moment. Nah, she couldn't really have been... could she? What could Baby Doll have been doing that is so terrible, so horrifying that she needs to create two layers of hallucinations to cope with it?<br/><br/>And herein lies the brilliance of the story. We as the audience simply don't know what really happened. Baby Doll is a untrustworthy narrator. She follows in the footsteps of Sam Lowry in ""Brazil"", and The Chief in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". Did that conversation really happen, or did she make it up for her own convenience? We can't even be sure how many of the characters were real, other than the fact that she saw them in the theater.<br/><br/>Think about it.<br/><br/>Nope, not one dimensional at all.<br/><br/>With regards to some of the listed goofs: The handwriting on the chalkboard changing between cursive and block letters every other shot... Hallucination, remember? Done on purpose.<br/><br/>And the mini-gun was never shown at full speed. Always in various stages of slo-mo. Even the fast bits were still slo-mo.

"Sidbose","Null","2","4","14 July 2011"," Don't remember when i gave a 9 in my review
","How often do you find a movie where the camera does the talking in the film's opening scene. You waltz with the visually stunning frames in and out of the story for full ten minutes before even realising that there were no dialogues!!! Sucker punch breaks the convention in many ways and at several levels. It demolishes the stereotype; challenges your tastes and offends your clichéd sensibilities. It is like a room full of colourful tapestries, each more beautiful than the other, so much so that their collective brilliance confounds the orthodox and humbles the willing. It is a simple story of a bunch of girls fighting their demons made brilliant by its unmatched style of presentation. So, it is not about what the film tells the audience, it is how it tells them. Director Zach Snyder's concept of a theatre inside an asylum is the key to the film which unlocks its secret in the very end. The story about girls finding their wits to escape the asylum also becomes the plank for them to break free from the reality into a surreal world where they become the protagonists and control their worlds. The ending is as dramatic and as devastating as life itself. It cannot be replayed. Like life, it is not fair. Like life it is not the least predictable. A must watch for those who are willing to widen their creative mindspace... Will give it a nine for making me think and think again."

","Video game films are really popular nowadays. From Silent Hill, to Doom, to the slew of Resident Evil films there is big money in films that are based on video games or graphic novels, such as The Spirit or 300. Sucker Punch isn't based on a video game, and there's no graphic novel that shares its name, though there probably should be, and probably will be after someone sees the film and decides to create one, but it is done with the same style as these films. There's lots of fighting, and monsters and robots and other things usually saved for the video game.<br/><br/>Baby Doll (Australian born actress Emily Browning) is locked away against her will, but her will isn't broken. She meets Rocket (Jena Malone), Rocket's sister, Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung) and they band together to escape their prison, and along with it the evil Blue (Oscar Isaac) and Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino), before the High Roller (Jon Hamm) comes for Baby Doll. <br/><br/>This is a fascinating film. The opening is one of the best you will ever see. Baby Doll kills her little sister by accident and is them put in a mental institution by her step father, but then everything changes. It's no longer a mental institution, it's a brothel. And the inmates are now dancers and ""working girls"" at the brothel. This is the world you find yourself in. It goes further than that too as Baby Doll is forced to dance she imagines a world of evil Nazi robots and trolls as she and the others battle to get items to survive this world they've been trapped in. It's all pretty surreal, but beautiful to behold. Zach Snyder, the director, creates an amazing world, within a world, within a world, to enthrall us all with a visual epic beyond anything we've seen before.<br/><br/>The acting by everyone involved is good. Emily Browning's Baby Doll is strong and self reliant, yet vulnerable and weak all at the same time, giving the character many layers. The stand out performances are from Oscar Isaac as the sleazy Blue and Carla Gugino's Madam Gorski. Blue is creepy and slimy and exactly the kind of person you love to hate. Isaac oozes his way through the performance from the first moment you meet him to the moment he's dragged away. Gugino's Madam Gorski is a bad, good guy. She's a woman that seems to be in control, but is as trapped as the girls she's meant to control. She plays the two sides of the character with complete believability. It must be said, however, that the film looses steam a little in the middle. After the 50 robot has been killed and the same shot is used again it gets a little boring, but then picks up again for the end. It would have been nice to see something a little different in the middle.<br/><br/>All in all this is a film for those that love the video game style of film, and there a lot of you out there. It's a feast for the eyes, both the girls and the shots, and action junkies will love it.<br/><br/><ul><li>www.celebrit-enow.com -</li></ul>"
"dfranzen70","7","2","4","29 March 2011"," Mixed bag, but still great to look at
","Sucker Punch is really two movies. One is pretty dang impressive, especially from a visual standpoint, and the other is really just mediocre. Combined, they make a half-decent film. It's one of those movies that looks so good and is set against a backdrop with sufficient surreality that one can easily not only suspend disbelief but also expel it, semipermanently, from one's mind.<br/><br/>A diminutive girl (Emily Browning) is thrown into an insane asylum by her evil stepfather after she accidentally kills her younger sister while defending her from his advances. Once in there, she's befriended/mocked/ostracized/encouraged by a group of young ladies, led by Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish). The asylum, we quickly learn, is really a very expensive brothel, and the girls earn their keep.<br/><br/>When the girl, named Baby Doll, is asked to dance during the girls' ballet practice by their taskmaster teacher Dr. Gorski (Carla Gugino), she retreats into an imaginary world that would put make Alice's Wonderland look like a trip to JC Penney's. Within this fantasy world, Baby Doll learns from a wise man (Scott Glenn) that she will need to locate certain artifacts in order to make her escape. When she comes out of her reverie – to much applause, as apparently her dance was just that good – Baby Doll has formed her plan.<br/><br/>Imagination is a powerful tool. Each time Baby Doll dances, she is able to get closer to her ultimate goal. But she isn't alone, not even in these fantasies – she is joined by Sweet Pea, Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), and Amber (Jamie Chung). One moment they're fighting the Germans in a steampunk warfront, the next they're in a Lord of the Rings setting, and so on, all to get those artifacts. That's the good, impressive movie. The meh one is the plot line outside of those fantasy scenes. True, the actresses all seem to have good chemistry with one another, but what we basically get is an evil asylum leader with lascivious intentions that are eclipsed only by his unmitigated greed. We do get quite a bit of urgency, too, as Baby Doll is scheduled for a lobotomy in just five days' time. And while Oscar Isaac, as bad guy Blue Jones, is hissable as a villain, there's almost no depth to his character at all, making his scenes with the girls excruciating and pointless to watch.<br/><br/>Here's something I did find a little odd. Browning, all bright eyed and bushy tailed, looked to me to be in her mid teens, an older sister to a single-digit sib. But when she's checked into the asylum by her stepfather, her age is given as 20. I don't know if Browning, who really is 22, looked 20 in this movie. But maybe that's a minor quibble.<br/><br/>The visuals will remind you of director Zack Snyder's earlier work with 300 and Watchmen, with maybe a smidge of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. Sweeping, violent, visceral war scenes, improbable action, the works. When the girls descend to kick ass – be the ass German, robot, orc, what have you – their movements are even less believable than those of the Crazy 88s in Kill Bill Vol. 1. But that's intentional, and here it works.<br/><br/>Overall, Sucker Punch is entertaining, and it delivers on its own premise. It's full of truly astounding cinematography, spectacular but not dizzying, and it features some pretty damn commanding performances, particularly by Browning, Cornish, and Malone."

","Sucker Punch is basically Zack Snyder's ""Inception"" - with an equally fascinating concept at the heart of his film - venturing into the mind of his central character - but a somewhat less masterful exploration of it than Nolan's aforementioned blockbuster.
The idea itself is intriguing & with further rewrites to streamline the narrative (& improve upon clunky dialogue), it could've been brilliant but unfortunately, what we're provided with is a mismatched, tonally incoherent, peculiar installment in Snyder's filmography...
Genuinely unsettling moments of tension with outstanding performances from Jena Malone, Oscar Isaac & Carla Gugino, inventive editing & composition of sequences, as well as effective uses of colour palettes in scenes with great cinematography - there's undeniably a lot to admire & appreciate; but the unpredictability in Snyder's direction is both a blessing & a curse, leaving things bordering on being blatantly inconsistent..."

Like I said in my title blurb, it is a spectacular production with absolutely stunning women, particularly Abbie Cornish and Emily Browning, and it is entertaining in many ways; unfortunately, the story is only moderately interesting.<br/><br/>Browning plays ""Baby Doll"" in the 1950s, whose wicked stepfather takes her to a mental asylum to receive a lobotomy. He wants to shut her up to hide his crimes, of course. She resorts to fantasy to escape her predicament, imagining herself and the other people at the asylum in a mob-owned brothel. When she's forced to dance at the ""brothel"" she withdraws further into wild fantasies involving feudal Japan, World War I German soldiers, a dragon and an assortment of other bizarre imaginations.<br/><br/>There's some depth here. The film's not all hot babes in lingerie and CGI-laden action fantasies. But I'll have to watch it a couple of more times to figure it out. The multi-layered nature of the plot -- reality turning to fantasy and then fantasy within fantasy -- is somewhat off-putting and tends to take one out of the story. As it is, the entertainment value is pretty much limited to the women and the outlandish action sequences. The story of the girls trying to get out of the brothel or asylum is only mildly compelling. Still, it's not bad and I may upgrade my rating after future viewings.<br/><br/>The film runs 110 minutes and the extended cut 127 minutes (I own the shorter version and that's more than enough for me).<br/><br/>GRADE: C+ or B- (but the women are a definite A+)"

I also think it could have been just a bit more realistic. Its a shame how a simple but powerful movie could have had more in it.

"licktheenvelope","7","0","0","24 December 2011"," I both liked and disliked this movie... here's why
","I will preface this by saying I probably had the worst type of experience the first time I tried watching Suckerpunch.<br/><br/>To cut a long story short, the first time I watched it I didn't see ANY of the middle section... that's right I saw the first 25 minutes, then the last 30 mins... and I was less than impressed. The first 25 minutes are very slow and the characters are hard to follow and flat.<br/><br/>I left my home and headed for my friend's house. Little did I know he was watching Suckerpunch too. ""Man!"" He said when I got there, ""have you seen this?! Such a wild movie!"" ... to which I replied... ""The first 25 minutes were borrrrrrring and I couldn't figure out any of the characters properly."" I watched the last 30 minutes with him and was left with a confused reaction. It certainly was not great. It also certainly was not even remotely close to the worst script or acting i've ever seen (not sure how many movies some reviewers on here have seen... Suckerpunch is shallow and flat... but not terrible).<br/><br/>I just finished watching all the middle parts I had not seen. I will certainly say it was not what I was expecting. There was actually some boring parts in amongst the CGI but there was also 3 moments that were truly amazing works of CGI/art direction, very well done.<br/><br/>To put my thoughts into concise summaries: What I disliked: The script could have been clearer, or lost completely. Really for the target market they could have cut out half of the dialogue and just added more girls dancing and killing things and that would have been fine with me. It was also taken far too seriously. If you're going to push it into fantasy dreamworlds there should be some sense of relief at some point.<br/><br/>What I liked: That it IS actually a movie that makes people react differently. I have friends who LOVE this movie and I have friends who can't stand it. Too many Hollywood movies try to be cookie-cutter repeats of something else (see the ludicrous amounts of prequels and sequels ... even to awful movies), at least Suckerpunch was something different.<br/><br/>Definitely could have been better, or worse, depending what you want out of a movie but it is different."

","The visuals and fight scenes are of the best quality of eye candy. The CGI is fantastic. But sadly the title says it all. On a story level it comes across as just that, the writer/director sucker punching the audience. The story made a faint attempt to hint at some kind of philosophy, without actually providing any. The warrior women seemed to be instantly endowed with fantastical fighting abilities without have to attain them. Those parts of the movie is all sugar but with no real taste. The rest of the movie is all like meat gone rancid. Just filming a movie, despite high production values, with such extremes does not necessarily a good story make.<br/><br/>I liked Watchmen a great deal and re-watch it often.

The Writing Material is innovative in the first-hour, but later-on, gets slightly uneven. The Special Effects are Spectacular, and truly stand out. Zack Snyder's Direction, is stylish.

"tuvalu19","Null","0","0","22 August 2011"," A film that succeeds despite its problems
","I don't usually add reviews to films on IMDb, but I felt I'd make an exception on Sucker Punch because it's such a confounding film. Before watching Sucker Punch I had read a number of reviews-- most of them poor-- detailing the film's standard reviewers' bullet-point failures. Most of the film's problems in these areas are legitimate and should be discussed, especially for those coming into the film looking for traditional film elements.<br/><br/>Character development is very thin. Zack Snyder never shows to us what the motivations of the movie's primary protagonist (Emily Browning) and her four companions really are. Aside from the heavily stylized introduction of Baby Doll (Browning) no background is ever revealed about how or why they came to the asylum which will leave many viewers frustrated, and might make it difficult to connect with the characters. There are odd plot points and tangential characters which the movie suggests have some deeper meaning or connection to the story but whose reason for existence is never fully revealed. One also gets the impression that scenes may have been cut or pared down for brevity, which may have left some of these plot points lopped off or unexplored.<br/><br/>Having said that, this movie is a powerhouse of anime-comic book style brought to film. And despite the lack of character and plot background, the acting and performances are actually very good, and in some cases quite powerful. Oscar Isaac's performance of the Orderly/Pimp is powerful and effective leaving a mark on the viewer's psyche. Carla Gugino's enigmatic role as the doctor/madame is convincing and beautiful. In some ways, Abbie Cornish and Jena Malone almost unwittingly capture the movie with their performance as sisters who help the protagonist Browning's Baby Doll hatch her escape plan from the asylum.<br/><br/>Finally, there's the visuals. The movie is so utterly successful at this, drawing in elements from Japanese Anime, steampunk and comic book styling, fantastic makeup and costume design coupled with a heart-pounding soundtrack made up of classic rock covers done in heavy electronic style, that it simply overwhelms any plot or character shortcomings of the film.<br/><br/>For any comic book/anime/steampunk fans, this film is a must see. I dispute some of what other reviewers have written, specifically in the realm of character performances. The acting is actually quite good, even excellent in the case of Isaac's performance of Blue. For fans of the genre, this is a DVD that you will want to purchase for your collection."

","Yep. Sucker Punch sure was an annoyingly frustrating movie to watch, on all counts. And, with that said, I really don't know where to begin tearing into it and trashing it as it so rightfully deserves.<br/><br/>For starters - I'd say that even though this film's subject matter was clearly geared to adults, it lost itself some significant points for wimping out by giving us a movie that was specifically aimed at those in the 14-year-old age-range.<br/><br/>So, that, in effect, completely destroyed the overall impact that this film's story could have had on a more mature-minded audience, which certainly included myself.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch was a perfect example of the sort of lame movie-making that directors, such as Zack Snyder, are frequently churning out these days.<br/><br/>Anyway - A film of this one's empty-headed and frivolous nature only served to disappoint and anger me to the nth degree. And, that, in turn, has prompted me here to write only negative comments about Sucker Punch in hopes that others, as well, will view this ultimate ""white-trash"" trash in a very similar light.<br/><br/>Enough said."
"kester_vr","6","5","16","24 March 2011"," Be unprepared
","In it's entire, the film is great to watch. However I did expect more from Zach Snyder. The slogan 'You will be unprepared' didn't apply to me since I've been waiting to see this since I saw the teaser, which was about a half year ago, so I expected a lot from it. So maybe I was too prepared and was therefor disappointed after wards, the same feeling I had with Watchmen.<br/><br/>Furthermore the film tries to send a message that, with me at least, didn't come through. The magnificent action-scenes make me forget that there is something more to the film. You have to remember the storyline and pay attention to every word to follow the plot, which can be hard with all that shooting.<br/><br/>You should see the film if you like Snyder's work, if not you should go for the action. Go see it unprepared, with not the highest expectations, and you will enjoy it more than me."
"abecipriano","8","6","21","25 March 2011"," As advertised
","Having raised my expectations after a friend showed me the two trailers of Sucker Punch in December, I went and caught it on the first day. I was not disappointed. You know there are movies that pretend to be something they're not (e.g. Rango seemingly a fun movie and for kids, but it's not; or the poster of The Adjustment Bureau that made it seem like an action flick, but it's not). When I saw the trailer, I saw girls in hot costumes, kick-ass action, anime-inspired material, and visual sequences as only visionaries like Zach S can bring to the screen.<br/><br/>Simply put, it was as advertised.<br/><br/>Emily Browning stars as Baby Doll, a girl who was checked into a mental institution by her abusive stepfather, whose imagination comes to life while she's inside. Maybe it's a coping mechanism, or something more purposive for her, or maybe it's Zach Snyder's creative way of showing difficulties in real life. With Baby Doll are other young ""girls"" Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Sweet Pea's sister Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), and Amber (Jamie Chung) who all band together and ooze testosterone (wait, or should it be estrogen, right? whatever...) with their swords, guns, heavily-armed vehicles, and martial arts moves, as they attempt to survive their daily hell. Impressive visuals are basically the norm of the film as expected, but at least this time we see more than we saw from the trailers (which were quick cuts but had enough oomph to get the average joe (READ: guys) interested to watch) -- kick-ass action and hot women. Hell, even women who like strong female leads could get into this, too. Though there definitely will be those that will get turned off by the way women are depicted in this film.<br/><br/>But don't get carried away - - this isn't Oscar-worthy acting, and the storyline, though well told in this visually-stunning, mind-F'ing, Inception-esque way--- is not that deep. But I didn't expect depth in a movie like this. And neither should you.<br/><br/>Acting was fine, especially for Jena Malone, whom I enjoyed watching when she was a kid in dramas like Stepmom and For Love of the Game. Abbie Cornish was good and intense. Lead Emily Browning had spunk and emotion in hey eyes; Jamie Chung and Vanessa Hudgens looked good, too, though not much else to see their acting chops. Oscar Isaac reminded me of that Numbers guy (is it David Krumholtz?), and he was scary and devious as Blue the orderly. While I am an admirer of Carla Gugino, her character's accent was somewhat weird and she only had moments, too. John Hamm's just a familiar name making a cameo, so his acting was severely underutilized. Like I said, it ain't Oscar-worthy, except maybe for visual effects/art direction, costume and the usual fare.<br/><br/>I still give it an 8 because I expected it like the way I saw the trailers, like I know Zach Snyder does films, and that's it.<br/><br/>Bring your popcorn and drink folks, and enjoy this ride. The Summer movie season starts with Sucker Punch."

","If you don't know the difference between female agency and a sadomasochistic fantasy, and you don't care to know, or if you think Justine is a feminist tract, you will love this movie. The story follows the adventures of Babydoll (no other name; perfect makeup, no matter what), who tries to kill her evil stepfather and accidentally kills her sister. He gets her thrown into an asylum, somehow, and -- holy ticking clock! -- she will be lobotomized with an ice pick by Dr. Jon Hamm in five days. What can she do? Dick-matizing sexy dancing and Inception levels of fantasy, that's what! Zach Snyder wrote Sucker Punch with male fans of Frank Miller and video games in mind (see: the top Imdb comment), with the thinnest possible veneer of interest for females, whom he must think are either stupid, or moved and deeply grateful at his depiction of rape and abuse. The only thing I'm grateful for is Oscar Isaac, who sings, dances, and chews all the non-CGI scenery. The podcast How Did This Made asked its listeners to complete this statement: ""Sucker Punch is to female empowerment as...."" There were a lot good responses, including ""...as Michael Bay is to subtlety"" and ""...as the Holocaust is to German pride."" Mine is ""...as Mandingo is to Civil Rights."""

"goforth-patrick","2","4","12","16 April 2011"," Sucker Punch aka Zach Synder losing his damn mind!!!
","Ahhh! Many this movie sucked hard, I'd been hearing some really bad buzz on this move and after seeing the 20 percentage rating on rotten tomatoes I was worried. And what do you know everyone was right. Let's start off with the problems this movie has which includes a sexist female empowerment image, a video game style story, the most god awful cover songs you'll ever hear and really cheesy dialogue and thin characters. The story deals with Babydoll who's mother dies literally in the first five minutes, man I guess she wanted out of this movie bad. She's paid by Emily Browning who you may know from ""A Series of Unforunate Events"" with Jim Carrey. And after he stepfather finds out the mother left everything to babydoll and her sister he trys to rape the two girls but while trying to fend off the father babydoll acidentially shoots her sister. Her father takes advantage of this and sends her to a mental hospital where he's set up a plan with the warden to have babydoll lobotomized in 3 days and she's only got that amount of time to escape. So basically babydoll can retreat into another world were it's basically a burlesque show/ the front for a gun running operation? I don't know ask Synder, there the other girls which include Jamie Chung, Vanessa Hungens, Abbie Cornish and Jena Malone all hatch a plan to escape the asylum before the doctor played by Jon Hamm and I'm crying holding my box set of Mad Men as I say that arrives to lobotomize Babydoll. However Madam Gorski who is played by Carla Gugino in what will for sure be a razzie nominated performance as a polish dancing instructor which sounds more like a Russian accent and like she should be hunting moose and squirrel tells babydoll she can go into another deeper reality (and this the part where they still from a great movie Inception)bastards. Anyway this is a hyper reality filled with dragons, Nazi Zombies, and robots on a monorail to Saturn. No I'm not joking that actually part of the movie. When Babydoll enters this reality she is greeted by Scott Glenn who's doing a really bad David Caradine impression and tells Babydoll she must find five items to set herself free which include a knife, a key, a map, a lighter, and a mysterious fifth item, hmmm I wonder what it will be!!! Anyway here are the problems with this movie first the main problem with this multi layered structure is that is somewhat types in the fantasy world it does not matter at all because it's all just a fantasy so you don't care at all about what's going on. Also I'm not joking when I say the first ten minute of this movie are in slow motion I'm not kidding. Also the movie is very pretentious and while your watching the movie you feel the enigma coming off the movie and how there's no original ideas in this movie there's the LOTR tribute section filled with Orcs from LOTR and the Dragon from the Hobbit. Then there's the Nazi's from Call of duty zombies and the robots from every single science fiction movie ever made, nothing original. Also the movie just doesn't make any damn sense I mean why is Babydoll having fantasy's about zombies, samurai and dragons does she like that stuff, it's never explained it just stuff that Zack Synder liked when he was 13 years old. Also the movie is supposed to take place in the 1950's or 1960's but in the fantasy sequences there are killing Nazi zombies with M16's and other weapons that had'nt even been invented yet. Also Synder himself has even said that he wants this to be a female empowerment movie and his wife is even co-producer on the film. I felt so offended by this I mean really I have no problem with a man making a female empowerment movie I mean just look at James Cameron he's made plenty of strong female characters like Sarah Conor and Ellen Ripley. But when showing crotch shots every five seconds, girls getting raped, giving guys lap dances and fighting in their bra and panties it just feels offense and insulting. The movie also has a sappy ending and a video game like structure where Scott Glenn basically tells the Girl there objective and from there they go on a linear path defeat some bad guys and reach the objective. There's one thing I'll give Snyder credit for which is he is a great visual director and I'll give it up to the storyboard artist who drew it but there's absolutely nothing original in the visual department people have not see before. So overall this is a mess, a pretentious mess I'm surprised it got a pg-13 rating I heard it was originally rated R but was heavily cut by Snyder I mean all the references to rape it's ridiculous and plus the cover songs in the brother are awful! I'm going to close by saying that Superman is probably sitting in the fortress of solitude right now thinking I'm so screwed!!!"

","If this film was two hours of sexy people with guns and samurai swords hacking up steam-punk zombie Nazis I would have had no trouble with it whatsoever. 300, another film by Snyder is unashamedly trashy but brilliant. What so annoyed me was the way this filmed attempted to pass itself off as a meaningful and moving examination of the human condition. The various parallel realities involved, the appallingly cheesy,forced, 'poignant' dialogue between the girl and the stupidly predictable cardboard-cutout characters were truly painful to watch. I guess I found this film so infuriating because it tried to deny what it was: an otherwise really enjoyable but brainless romp with some really fantastic CGI and wonderfully ridiculous, over-the-top fight-scenes. If not for these (which were very entertaining) it would get 1 star. No doubt many people enjoyed this film, hence its pretty reasonable rating, I did not, but that may be just me."

The writing sucked, the casting sucked, the acting sucked, the soundtrack sucked, the story as a whole sucked...it felt like watching a very badly done soft-core porn flick with some incredible special effects and set design. I suspect that if you gave the average American 13-year-old boy a few million dollars to make a movie, it would probably look a lot like this.<br/><br/>As one of the first really blatantly Steam-Punk movies, it was a major disappointment.<br/><br/>The basic concept was apparently good enough to dump a lot of money into, but not good enough to be developed into anything resembling an engaging story.<br/><br/>I would just take it as a given that the acting sucked - in fact of all the actresses, the lead is easily the worst of the lot - but it's not just that the acting sucked...it REALLY sucked. The characters were flat and had no appeal or chemistry. The dialogue felt like a waste of time and was totally unconvincing both in content and delivery. I admit, however, if I had that much Botox pumped into my lips, I'd have a hard time delivering lines as well.<br/><br/>The plot? I have played video games with a more engaging and in depth plot - and several with better writing and acting as well.<br/><br/>It seems like the whole purpose of the movie is to play out sexual fantasies. Way too many convenient excuses to play out rape fantasies<br/><br/>Horrible soundtrack. Mostly very unoriginal covers and remixes of what were originally some very good songs. It came off as a really cheap way of trying to have a good soundtrack.<br/><br/>****SPOILER?****** The plot hinges on the leads ability to perform paralyzingly alluring dances, however you never see her dance and her performance gives no indication that she has any dancing skills whatsoever. In fact, you never see anyone dancing until the music video in the end credits, in which the lead character does not appear.<br/><br/>Probably the most annoying thing about the movie is it's attempts at being profound and tragic. It only succeeds by being a profoundly tragic waste of expensive special effects and good art direction.<br/><br/>The movie in general tries hard to be original, hip, edgy, profound, tragic, artsy, etc and fails over and over."

I also expected to see some visually rich, CG-infused action scenes, and again, wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>What Snyder attempts to do with this film is never fully realized, as we are at first subjected to a boring, drab sequence intended to make us FEEL something for the story's heroine. I never did. There wasn't enough there to hook me. I just kept waiting for the alternate reality action sequences to kick in.<br/><br/>When the action does finally start, the film jumps into overdrive - but in fits and starts, and only visually. The story and characters, even for an action-heavy fantasy film (very little in the way of sci-fi tech or imagery), are so silly and disconnected that the viewer is never given the opportunity to care about them. Yes, I get the idea that this is ""insanity envisioned"", but still ... it left me feeling flat.<br/><br/>The arc of the story itself builds toward an epic finish, but ultimately disappoints the viewer as the film completely falls apart in the final 20 minutes. I'm sure Snyder thought he was making a tragedy, but that form only works when the audience is drawn in by character exposition and solid plotting, neither of which exist in this film."

It was weird to see that Snyder did not manage to hold together the linear story, and it felt that some distinct parts of the movie were quite good, but the link was so abrupt that you remain with nothing.<br/><br/>The start of the movie sets expectations that are completely lost halfway through, and towards the end it feels that your IQ gets depressed by the lack of plot thickness.<br/><br/>All in all, is not completely garbage, but it will go down in history as just another CGI movie.<br/><br/>Go get your lobotomy."

There was so much going on in the film, all the action, fighting, dancing, plotting and the music was fitted so perfectly. Loved finding out that Emily Browing sung a couple of them; especially the stunning 'Sweet Dreams Are Made Of This' in the opening of the film which was breathtaking and very well filmed which definitely set a high standard for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>I think everyone should see this movie regardless of whether you normally watch this genre of film because it was fresh and something new and you may find that you actually do enjoy it.

","As a Zack Snyder fan I was excited to see that he had finally released an original piece of work, rather than another adaptation such as Watchmen etc. <br/><br/>I watched this film in the cinemas twice. So instantly you'll be able to tell this is a rather positive review of the movie and I enjoyed it greatly.<br/><br/>Babydoll played by Emily Browning is thrown into a mental asylum by her evil stepfather after her mother and sister's death. She is scheduled for a shady lobotomy by her stepfather in five days to hide the truth about her sister's death. To cope with her horrible reality, Babydoll envisions that the asylum is a brothel where the girls dance for the men. Babydoll plans to escape the mental asylum and enlists the help of her fellow inmates in acquiring items to aid their escape. Whilst the girls are stealing the various items, Babydoll dances to distract the men and while she is dancing she envisions different battles (from giant mecha samurais, to steam punk world war 1 zombie Germans, to a castle battle with monsters and dragons, to robot gunmen on a train) that depict the girls acquiring the specific items.<br/><br/>This film is beautiful! As you would come to expect from Zack Snyder, the cinematography is gorgeous and stylized; it really captures Snyder's vision and scope of the film. The different battles are amazing, my favourite by far being the giant mecha samurais battling against the tiny Emily Browning.<br/><br/>Many people have said that Sucker Punch is a sexist film. It is far from that and many of the lead actresses will say the same thing. OK so yes, the costumes are a tad raunchy, but that's what makes the film what it is! You couldn't just have the girls battling in alternate realities in boring old 60′s clothes.<br/><br/>The music is by far a stand out in the film. The way Snyder has used music with the vision gives it a very video game/music video feel and this works exceptionally well. A stand out track would definitely have to be Emily Browning's haunting version of Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) which was used at the start of the movie behind the slow motion action of Babydoll's past. Actually, all of Emily Browning's songs are great! She has an beautiful voice which I never knew she had before this film.<br/><br/>One thing I hate more than anything, is people comparing films to other films. And Sucker Punch has copped these comparisons left right and centre. NO this is NOT Inception, NO this is NOT the Matrix and NO this is NOT Kill Bill or anything else you can think of. It is an original piece of work with an original story line. And even though it showed obvious influences from anime and other films, it is completely original! Sucker Punch has an awesome story and message of hope, friendship and self discovery. The movie is not over complicated, but a lot of people might not understand exactly what's going on; for instance the guys I saw it with didn't fully understand the transformation of the asylum into a brothel. The message it tries to convey isn't overly complicated and if you go into the film thinking you'll gain some greater understanding of life, or go in thinking it'll be something it isn't, you'll be sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>In essence, Sucker Punch is an escapism film, designed to transport the audience into the stylized world of Zack Snyder's characters.<br/><br/>The movie had several twists and turns that will hit you like a ""Sucker Punch"" (sorry for the overly bad pun). You won't expect some things and I won't ruin the ending, but you don't see it coming at all.<br/><br/>To conclude, I loved Sucker Punch! This is by far Zack Snyder's best film yet and had strong performances from all actors, but especially Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish and Oscar Isaac.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour and go and see Sucker Punch while it's still in the cinemas!<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Joshwahr/Inglorious Fiction"
"jtmytake3","4","3","8","13 April 2011"," Sucker Punched or lobotomised....you decide???
","I cannot say that I was actually looking forward to watching this movie, when I first saw the teaser trailer and the synopsis for this story if you want to call it that I kept thinking to myself.....really?? However I remained objective even dispelling the brief reviews I was subjected to before watching this movie. I think it is at first wise to put the work of the co writer and director Zack Snyder into context as his previous work is highly entertaining I refer in particular to '300' and 'Watchmen'. His accolades are so numerous that he has been charged with bringing the new 'Superman' reboot to the screen titled simply 'Man of Steel'.<br/><br/>The premise of this story is simple....I say that with tongue firmly in cheek!! The story takes place in the 60's where Babydoll (Emily Browning) a 20 year old girl institutionalised by her stepfather after the death of her mother she is blamed for the suspicious death of her younger sister. Once in the Lennox House of the Mentally Insane we learn that her evil stepfather has bribed one of the orderlies Blue to fake the signature of the asylum's Doctor Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino) so that in five days she is lobotomised and thus the true events of what happened to her younger sister can never come to light and the stepfather can keep the money bequeathed to the daughters. In the days leading up to her date with the doctor with the hammer she retreats into a fantasy world where she is an intern at a brothel owned by Blue (Oscar Issac). In this imaginary world she has conjured for herself she is a dancer awaiting the high roller who is to take her away for his own pleasure she meets and befriends fellow dancers; Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone) and Rocket's older sister Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish). Madam Gorski (who is also the doctor in the real world) encourages and teaches Babydoll to dance provocatively and during the dance she regresses into another world where in turn she has to fight giant Samurai, WWI German soldiers, and an Orc infested castle and giant dragon and mechanised guards on a train containing a bomb. All these scenarios represent actions and therefore have repercussions in the brothel world she has created for herself. See simple! What can I say about this movie...well first I think that Mr Snyder is a visionary when it comes to the visual spectacle mixing glossy special effects with comic style Kung Fu and gun-play. I also think if he ever attempts to pick up a pen to write another movie someone should wrestle the pen from him and lock him in a room until he comes to his senses. The story is weak and the dialogue is excruciatingly awful Snyder's ego it appears has run away with his common sense and his holding it ransom. This is a story that makes no sense in a world of nonsense. The slow motion shots of the young women attempting to saunter around on screen looking sexy is very droll indeed and is obviously straight out of a schoolboy fantasy about women...young women. How Ms Hudgens had the audacity to defend the costume choices in this movie is beyond me. This is a perfect example of what special effects without a story can equate to.....a story containing mindless violence with purpose akin to a chocolate teapot. The movie belts along like a giant music video with the music blaring loudly, its very like a video game with each level becoming increasingly more insane than the last. I'd love to meet the movie exec' that green lighted this drivel and shout at him 'I don't think you really wanted to do that (with Harry Enfield voice). There are very few pluses here Snyder has directed at least two good movies which I have already mentioned and I am now losing some faith in his ability to bring to the screen 'Man of Steel' thankfully he isn't writing that picture so let's hope he can't mess that up. So if you're looking for mindless violence delivered by scantily clad young women beating up Orcs, dragons and giant samurai then get the new video game called oh no sorry go and see this movie....otherwise stay yo' ass at home...I wish I did!!"

"Mikeboy0001","7","3","8","7 April 2011"," Why Is It Being So Spanked?
","I had some fears in going see this movie after reading the reviews, but I'm glad I did anyway. Why everyone is trying to give it some deep inner meaning and stating it sucks because it has no meaning, is beyond me. It has a meaning, just a very simple and straightforward one. It's a plot in a madhouse, but movies in mental institutions exist by the dozens, so this one takes that premise and goes to another directions to give lots of fun to the viewer. It's a great ride. Movies like Inception or specially Brazil revolve around alternate universes created in our mind, and this one too, why is it being so bashed because of that, I don't understand. It's a journey of imagination, where all that a grown kid loves put together in awesome visuals: World War I and II, Robots, Samurais, Dragons, a Cabaret and hot girls. Movies aren't only supposed to be exactly the same has the real world, they are supposed to take you to new Worlds too, and this one does just that. I really enjoyed it, and recommend it to those seeking action fantasy with lots of fun, charm and great style. 7.5/10"
"tieman64","Null","3","8","7 April 2011"," Pastiche porn: now with newfound guilt
","Zack Snyder directs ""Sucker Punch"". The plot: a young woman and her sister are sexually abused by their father. The eldest sister, Baby Doll (Emily Browning), fights back and is wrongly blamed for her sister's death. Baby Doll is then sent to a mental hospital; she will be lobotomised in five days. Whilst being operated upon, Baby Doll temporarily escapes her traumatic reality by slipping into a fantasy world nested within her ""real world"". Here, the hospital's operating theatre becomes a literal theatre within a brothel, whilst the hospital's evil head nurse becomes a powerful pimp.<br/><br/>Within the brothel fantasy, Baby Doll is forced to perform salacious dance routines for an audience. Significantly, Snyder never shows Baby Doll dance. Instead he cuts away, short-circuiting his audience's salacious desires for abuse by showing her retreat further into a string of fantasy sequences. These fantasy sequences take the form of video game levels, Baby Doll's mission in each level tied to corresponding missions in both the brothel and the hospital. For example, when Baby Doll battles a fire breathing dragon in the video game level, this is simply a means of violently staving off the dangers of stealing a cigarette lighter in both the brothel and hospital levels. All the other video game action scenes have a similar symbolic function. A cook's belt in the brothel/hospital level becomes a CGI train in the video game level, for example.<br/><br/>Whilst ""Sucker"" may superficially resemble films like ""Inception"", ""Existenz"" and ""The Matrix"", its granddaddy is more akin to something like ""The Shining"". In both films, each level of fantasy is triggered by the denial of abuse, though Kubrick offers no clear ""levels"" or ""separations""; all reality is already fantasy.<br/><br/>Eventually a ray of light shines for Baby Doll, the poor girl dreaming up a pair of sisters to help her escape the hospital/brothel, one of which symbolically becomes her own dead sister. From here on. the film can be viewed in one of two ways. Either as a fantasy in which Baby Doll rescues her sister in the fantasy world, whilst she herself remains behind and is lobotomised (reversing an earlier scene in which Baby Doll's sister is raped because Baby Doll saved herself), or an equally unpleasant fantasy in which Baby Doll's sister dies in both the real world and the fantasy world, whilst Baby Doll, whose dreaming body remains behind in the mental hospital, pretends to escape the brothel as an avatar called Sweat Pea. Either way, Baby Doll's regressed to a vegetable.<br/><br/>Snyder attempts to critique his audience and action movie expectations. ""I didn't put them in those provocative outfits,"" Snyder says in interviews, ""you did! The audience in the brothel are us sitting in the theatre! The exploitative part of it is in the viewer! The viewer brings that!"" <br/><br/>He's right to an extent, and it is clever the way Snyder both structures his film as a giant rape movie and revokes each of Baby Doll's sexualised dance routines before likening the unseen acts to conventional action scenes (ie action movie violence is sublimated sex). But this still doesn't change the fact that the raison d'être of the film, Snyder's entire desire to make this film, stemmed from a desire to find a narrative which allowed him to go wild with zany spectacle. The end result is a film which does exactly what it condemns; a 12A certificate film that markets the sexy spectacle of abused teenage girls for teenage boys.<br/><br/>Some have said that ""Sucker"" offers a strictly male fantasy version of female empowerment (ie, the false ""feminism"" of Cameron, Scott and Tarantino etc). That Baby Doll can't even escape without the help of a magical old man. This is true, but the film also has a genuine aura of tragedy. Each of Baby Doll's fantasy battles are also explicitly giant, mocking, castration fantasies, filled with deflating zeppelins, and much phallic imagery; she's a meta-aware sex object.<br/><br/>Today we casually accept the consented sexual exploitation of young women and typically only accept female-driven ""heroism"" when its sexualised or presented as fantasy. Similarly, TV and cinema are now awash with ""porn porn"", plots in which supposedly ""enlightened"" audiences are asked to ""sympathise"" with the ""deep troubles"" of beautiful women who are ""horribly exploited"", subjugated, raped or objectified by ""bad men"", acts of hypocritical sympathy which only exist to titillate audiences in the first place. In short, everything ""Sucker Punch"" does has long been a 21st century trend. Today, sexploitation almost always masquerades as a critique of patriarchy.<br/><br/>Elsewhere ""Sucker"" focuses on what academics like to call the effects of the ""male gaze"" on women. But the ""gaze"" does not only affect women; everyone loses autonomy when realising that he/she is a visible object, and objectification is itself a general condition or main erotic impulse of late capitalism (again another Kubrick film, ""Eyes Wide Shut"").<br/><br/>Ironically, ""Sucker"" is of interest primarily in the way it exemplifies cinema's ongoing death throes; its mimicking of video game aesthetics to generate post cinematic affect. What you literally have here is a film about modern film's inability to offer escape, Baby Doll forced to retreat further and further away from the brothel's sound-stage and theatre spaces and into ""modern"" virtual landscapes generated by the ""combined"" and ""shared imagination"" of whores who must continuously construct interactive fantasy levels, schizoid digital noise, lest they realise that both they and their audience are perpetually imprisoned. It's the kind of thing critiqued in Cronenberg's ""Existenz"" and ""Crash"" - an addiction to increasingly intense digital spaces as a form of escape and denial - though Snyder could care less. ""Sucker Punch is like a video game that doesn't exist,"" Snyder says. ""It's the game you want to play but it hasn't been made; when I drew two pages of storyboards, I rewarded myself with one game of Black Ops."" <br/><br/>6/10 – Worth one viewing."
"zardoz-13","7","3","8","3 April 2011"," Larger-Than-Life Fantasy Extavaganza!
","""Watchmen"" director Zack Snyder's bizarre, babes-in-bondage, fantasy epic imitates Terry Gilliam's far darker, Orwellian, science-fiction satire ""Brazil."" Like ""Brazil"" (1985), ""Sucker Punch"" taps into the imagination--where anything goes--of an individual--a single, white, female here--before a doctor lobotomizes her at a corrupt mental institution. This ensemble, female-empowerment, chick flick arms Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, and Jamie Chung to the teeth with samurai swords, sub-machine guns, automatic pistols, and attitude galore as they slash, shoot, and kick their way through a hellzapoppin' variety of ""Heavy Metal"" escapades with wizen Scott Glenn briefing them about each mission. Of course, their fetish costumes are as immaculate as the situations that they encounter. This PG-13 rated movie rarely grovels in blood, guts, and gore, and the crisply staged violence is nowhere as savage as ""Saving Private Ryan."" The adventures that Baby Doll and her accomplices embark on before her lobotomy will make you feel like you've been plunged into a swirling vortex of popular culture imagery. This imagery ranges from doll-faced manga-influenced comics to high-stepping musicals like ""Moulin Rouge,"" to strange sword & sorcery sagas with vengeful mother dragons, to actual events like World War I trench warfare with Zeppelins air ships that burst into high-octane orange explosions. The soldiers in the World War I sequence are thoroughly ominous-looking, steam-powered German zombie-cyborgs. Every time that either a bullet strikes them or a sword blade gashes them, steam erupts in pneumatic jets from their uniformed bodies.<br/><br/>""Sucker Punch"" occurs in the 1960s. The prologue that establishes our heroine's predicament blends the creepy look of E.C. Comics with gritty Hollywood B-movies about woman behind bars. Baby Doll (Emily Browning of ""Ghost Ship"") and her younger sister react with shock to the death of their mother. Later, Baby Doll's wicked stepfather (Gerard Plunkett of ""2012"") flies into a rage when he reads his wife' will. He gets nothing, while the two daughters get everything. The furious stepfather decides to rape the younger daughter. First, he locks Baby Doll in her bedroom. Second, he kicks down the door to the younger girl's room. After she breaks out of her room, Baby Doll grabs a gun from downstairs to blast him. Accidentally, she misses the stepfather and tragically shooting her young sister. In no time at all, the stepfather has Baby Doll committed to the spooky Lennox House for the Mentally Insane in Vermont. Snyder films this entire opening gambit as if it were an extended MTV rock video. An asylum orderly, the slimy Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac of ""The Nativity Story""), demands that the stepfather pay him $2,000 to forge the signature of asylum psychiatrist Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino of ""Sin City"") on the form to authorize Baby Doll's lobotomy. Mind you, the stepfather neither wants for the authorities to discover what really happened at home nor does he want Baby Doll to receive her mom's fortune. Initially, Baby Doll learns that she has five days before the lobotomy is scheduled.<br/><br/>The first jarring thing about ""Sucker Punch"" is the abrupt change of settings. Once you have resigned yourself to watching a movie that takes place in a mental asylum like the one in ""Shutter Island,"" you find the setting shifted to a classy bordello where the girls perform exotic dances for the well-heeled customers. Each time that Baby Doll dances, she mesmerizes her audiences. She imagines that each dance is like completing a larger-than-life mission. During the first mission, she meets a sword master (Scott Glenn) who furnishes her with an arsenal of weapons to battle three gigantic samurai warriors who have piercing red eyes. Baby Doll behaves like an invulnerable heroine. She survives blows from these humongous samurai warriors that would kill ordinary people. Later, she makes friends with the first inmate/dancer when she saves Rocket from being raped by a porcine cook. Eventually, Baby Doll assembles a ""Fox Force Five"" unit of dames -- Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish of ""Limitless""), Rocket (Jena Malone of ""The Soloist"" ), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens of ""High School Musical"") and Amber (Jamie Chung of ""Sorority Row"") -- to cavort in the strip-club fantasy costumes with a combination of S.W.A.T gear and samurai swords to obtain four crucial things. Sweet Pea is the hardest of them to convince because she is the most hopeless member of the quintet. Once they come together, they act like a team until the villains whittle down their numbers.<br/><br/>Three far-fetched, outlandish sequences with our glamorous ensemble carrying out a mission occur in the episodic ""Sucker Punch."" Mind you, each mission yields rewards that will enable our heroines to escape from the dreadful insane asylum. According to Baby Doll, they need an asylum map to get past the guards. Furthermore, they need fire--in the form of a butane lighter, a knife, and a special key. Obviously, the special key is a master key that will open any asylum lock. Naturally, none of the imaginative, over-the-top missions that transpire on screen apart from those opening and closing moments aren't remotely realistic. Compared with ""300,"" ""Dawn of the Dead,"" and ""Watchmen,"" ""Sucker Punch"" delivers lightweight blows, but deploys them out with greater sophistication. The characters are as stereotypical as the set-pieces are formulaic. Of course, our heroines are constantly out numbered. Ironically, our heroine surmounts her bigger-than-life obstacles, achieves her incredible goal, but she pays a dear price for it in the long run.<br/><br/>Director Zack Snyder immerses our ear drums with atmospheric chart-topping tunes for more than the sake of their rock'n roll cult status. This music propels Baby Doll into her different states of mind. Moreover, Snyder observed that the music thematically holds the film together. Listening to ""Sucker Punch"" is like grooving to golden oldies such as ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This),"" ""White Rabbit,"" and two Queen songs ""I Want It All,"" and ""We Will Rock You."" Despite its one-dimensional characters and sensory-overload visuals, ""Sucker Punch"" qualifies as a suspenseful, above-average, metaphorical, but downbeat fantasy !"

The asylum people are just evil. Slimy, disgusting, evil. Also, DO NOT take small children to see this.

So, while we won't see justice served on film, that slimeball will be arrested.<br/><br/>I felt bad for Baby Doll, but I also figured out what was going to happen really quick.

Well kind of, as long as you have zero expectations regarding a comprehensible plot. ""Sucker Punch"" is visually spectacular, just as you'd expect with most of Snyder's work. The visuals are definitely the movie's strongest suit, with incredible and unique combat sequences, ranging from killing zombie Helghast-look-alikes (from the Killzone games) in a WWII setting, to fighting gigantic living samurai statues.

","I Did not like this film i just found it too confusing and jumbled up to be enjoyable. I found the beginning of the film very depressing and annoying when the lead girl known as (baby doll) fights with her step dad. the start of the film looks like a music video because not a single person talks!. the dad tries to attack the girls younger sister so the lead girl tries to shoot him to protect her and some how she MISSES!?. which makes no sense! because she was only about two feet away from him!. the girl was either blind or just plain stupid!. the bullet hits the light bulb which is up high and some how the girls younger sister was shot? but we never know how because we never see the bullet hole or blood?. the sister was shot some how?.i'm sorry but that scene made no sense to me, how the hell could the bullet hit the sister? the sister was no where near the bullet!. what did the bullet do? bounce off the light bulb?.How could the girl miss him from such close Range?.so some how the lead girl kills her sister but it made no sense!. the lead girl then has a chance to shoot her step dad again but does she do it? No! she just drops the gun and runs away! which was stupid! because running away only makes her look more guilty!.then her step dad calls the police and sets the girl up and makes her look like the enemy even though he attacked them!. Its called self defence so why didn't the girl TALK!?. that's all she had to do she should have told the police the sick man tried to attack them and they would have listened! and then she never would have been locked up but NO she says nothing and as a result she ends up in an asylum.<br/><br/>this film was very annoying! because such a simple situation could have been solved and all the girl had to do was EXPLAIN!. but of course she says nothing so the stepfather gets away with it and she ends up looking like the bad guy even though the death of her sister was an accident. pretty much for the rest of the film Baby doll never talks! which is very annoying because there were allot of people that could have helped her but the girl was not even willing to save herself which made me not care about her character. this film had poor characters with no personality's. her stepfather and an orderly at the hospital were talking behind her back about lobotomising her and for some reason the girl never talks? for some reason she never tells anyone what the men are planning to do?.Later we see (baby Doll) getting a lobotomy and the film then goes to a dream world in a brothel at the asylum where Baby doll and these girls become dancers and when baby doll dances she can create a dream world and from there on the film got worse. i understood what the director was trying to do,he was trying to do a dream within a dream but it did Not work.having two false reality's was a BAD idea because we never know what's happening in real life!.<br/><br/>the film keeps going from dream 1 to dream 2 and then back again and its very confusing. this film was like a bad version of Alice in wonderland. there were no likable characters,the director probably wanted us to feel sorry for the girls in this film because they are bullied by the men but the problem is i didn't even know what characters were Real! and what characters were fake! so why should i care about any of them?. yes i knew the girls in her (dream) were the ""good guys"" but in the real world i knew nothing about these people or whether they even existed!. the only two characters i knew where actually real were (baby doll) and the (sweet pea) girl but that's it!.i knew absolutely nothing about sweet Pea's character in the (real world). just because she was nice in baby dolls (dream world) that doesn't mean its how she is in real life!. for all we know the girl could be a lunatic in real life!. (we don't know) and that's my point. sucker punch sucks so much as a story because there is never any danger!. the girls fight with Robots and dragons in the dream world because they need to collect these five items. the problem is none of it is real which ultimately makes it ""pointless"". the viewers never have a clue what is going on in real life because It just goes from fantasy to fantasy.<br/><br/>for example what would happen to baby doll if she was shot in her fantasy world?. nothing would happen! because its not REAL! and that's my point!. this film is trying to be like Inception meets Alice in wonderland and it Does Not work!. I will admit the film has some good visuals and some cool fights but it lacks in everything else. The major problem with this film is that it has (NO STORY). the whole film revolves around going from dream to dream to collect items and Fight Robots because apparently if they do that they will be ""free"" which is Rubbish in my opinion.the only way baby doll will be ""free"" is if she TALKS!. if she had of spoken to the police at the start she would have never been in the asylum to begin with!. Also the ending of the film explains nothing and is not very satisfying.<br/><br/>the message this film tries to send out is that girls should keep fighting until the very end to (defend themselves) but the funny thing is baby doll just (gives up) near the end.so much for fighting to the very End!."

Either way, I'd seek therapy.<br/><br/>This movie is nothing more than an idea that started with ""OMG we have a huge budget to make a movie, but we are not sure what to make, so lets spend it all on CGI and people won't care if we come up with utter rubbish.""<br/><br/>Usually I would give some credit if I could see a good idea was there to begin with, but then somehow it lost it's way. However I cannot do that here. There was no effort put into the actual story line at all. If the Producers honestly believe their was, then I truly think they are high too. I often hear the excuse ""Yeah, but we thought outside the box and went to a place that only a select intelligent few can truly understand."" What bull! If few understand it then there is nothing there to understand at all really and you are just coming up with reasons why it sucked. <br/><br/>Rather take your huge budget and buy a luxurious private jet plane. It will be more useful in the long run, even if only to yourself."

","...but instead of a script all they have to work from is the doodles at the back of a fourteen-year-old schoolboy's notebook. <br/><br/>It's very strange to see so much money wasted on such a weak premise: the plot, if that is what you can call it is as follows: misunderstood adolescent girl is incarcerated in a mental asylum by her wicked step- father, but ""escapes"" by imagining she's a misunderstood adolescent girl incarcerated in a brothel. Where she does interpretative dance while fantasising that she's part of a crack team of scantily-clad steampunk commandos.<br/><br/>Why? One can only surmise that Snyder wanted to make his steampunk- pole-dancing-commando movie but couldn't come up with a plot to fill in between the action sequences. So they were inserted into the brothel scenario, which was then inserted into the asylum bit to make it all look really ""deep""--to anyone who was stoned enough.<br/><br/>I'm sure I've seen worse films, but never one that was so pointlessly well filmed."

Everything else, besides the plot, was pretty good. Pretty babes, good music, spectacular CGI.<br/><br/>Still, I would better sit on my couch watching some bikini parade on my TV, listening to music and later go watch a movie that my brain can put together."

","Yep! That's almost all what I have to say about ""sucker punch"". A film that ought to be a masterpiece and ended merely as a good action flick. Very simple plot about a girl that imagines a whole world from his living disgrace. The only thing I wonder is how can you make a PG - 13 movie from such a hyper sexual script. Only Snyder can do that.<br/><br/>I was expecting way too much. I only got sucker punched...<br/><br/>I went to see this movie, just to figure out how good or bad Superman ""Man of steel"" can be. Now I don't know. Zack Snyder is very good adapting comics to the big screen, but yesterday, while watching ""sucker punch"", I realized that ""300"" and ""watchmen"" were previously written by someone else. maybe he's a good director, but not a good writer.<br/><br/>as I said before: The sound track was awesome! 4 / 10."
"grammaton61","8","3","9","5 April 2011"," Action that puts a smile on your face
","I loved Sucker Punch, and count it as my favorite truly action-centered movie, even above The Matrix. The story and premise was great regardless of critical viewers' opinions. The opening to the movie set the tone and also pressed the theme of abuse which added the bitter element needed to keep the movie gripping. Sucker Punch is in a genre that is otherwise largely dominated by childish components, so a mature tone without the explicitness is noteworthy. Some of my favorite movies include Gladiator, Defiance, and Blood Diamond, both for their real-to-life injustices and bitter-sweet endings. To be honest, Sucker Punch is not to be compared with the movies above, however, it contains elements that made those movies great, and because of that you can take it more seriously. <br/><br/>Overall, it's an action-packed, fun, and saddening story. As a guy, obviously the beautiful and awesome girls are a major draw. But miniskirts aside, the real meaningful factor is the anger that anyone should have against the 'bad' characters in the movie. It's a good movie to get fired up about, showcasing true-to-life abuse that goes on, yet in very imagined and creative world. More can be taken from this movie than simply the most spectacular fantasy fight scenes and environments ever created."
"pbrowne12","4","3","9","4 April 2011"," Why?
","I was so excited for this to come out. I waited months and months, then finally it was here and I was sorely disappointed. Zack Snyder's remake of Dawn of the Dead is one of my favorite movies. 300 and Watchem were both awesome movies. This one was ""pretty"", that's about all I can say. Like all of his other movies it was shot beautifully. The CGI was awesome and so was the action. The movie as a whole fell short. The story line was ridiculous. It was way to undeveloped. If they put a little more time in the story it could have been OK. The acting really wasn't anything special either. I like Carla Gugino in most movies, however in this one she just couldn't keep her accent and at times was pretty noticeable. The other girls weren't anything special either. They weren't terrible but it was all very one leveled for me. I love beautiful women with guns just as much as the next guy but for me this was huge let down. This was Zack Snyder's first he helped write the script ( I believe ), maybe he should just stick with what he's good at, simply directing. O and as for the ending quote at the end of the movie. RIDICULOUS."

","Once I heard about this film last year at comic con, I was literally counting the days and now that I finally got the chance to see it, I am extremely disappointed.<br/><br/>The first 10-20 min of the film is like a damn music video and the so- called 'dancing' scenes made no sense whatsoever. <br/><br/>I did like the fight scenes; they weren't good but were the best scenes in the film and I'm sure any guy who saw it would love it considering the outfits the girls were wearing while fighting. Also I like the concept of how she created a world for her to escape the procedure and through that she was fighting to stay alive, but for me those were the only pros in the film.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't bad, I think the people who stood out the most was Oscar Isaac and Carla Gugino. Abbie Cornish and Jenna Malone were good and I was impressed with Jamie Chung. As for Emily Browning and Vanessa Hudgens, they were mediocre. <br/><br/>I guess someone who doesn't have high expectations of this film would enjoy, but I think the majority of the people who liked it would be men and people who love video games."

","Sucker Punch is not a bad movie at all... In fact it's better than just good... It's Great!!! The story is simple and straight to the point. The opening is a bit drawn out maybe 10-15 min... But after thinking the movie was gonna bomb, it did a complete 360... I think overall it was very well put together... All the actresses were pretty and real at the same time, which is rare to find in movies now days... The main villain plays a good enough part for you to hate and the ""Dance"" teacher's pronunciation is right on point making her character unique and believable... This movie is a movie to ""Own""!!! Sure it implicates fantasy worlds and unbelievable scenarios, but lets get real, this is Hollywood anyway!!! It might be far fetched but it has its real moments as well... One of my favorite things about the movie is it is sexy but not ""Slutty"" Nudity is not needed to portray the visuals, as your mind interprets what you see... This is a movie made for thinkers and if thinking through a movie bothers you, than you will hate this movie... The action is of coarse at its peek... Obviously I liked the movie so I will describe what I would say the major flaws are: Somewhat of a long opening, CGI very noticeable, and the Dialogue at times can be weak... All in all 8 out of 10... This movies is it's own genre of movie's... GO SEE IT!!!"

","OK, for me this movie was hard to watch in places but I liked this movie. However for me whether intended by the director or not, it was a very symbolic movie. As someone who was abused and is close to one who lived very much her reality, the symbolisms were apt. The brothel, the dancing all of that, it took the power away from her abuser, her action world, slaying dragons, her dragons, empowering her, helping her endure, and to persevere. Those who have lived extreme abuse do live primarily in their head. However I will say this movie was slanted with an anime, superhero kind of vibe to appeal to a broader audience, to wow with special effects etc. But you can see meaning in it if you know what you are looking at."

Just like what Sweet Pea said to Baby Doll at last ""Is got to be another way"" to make it more interesting and exciting.<br/><br/>But what i really like is the wardrobe design, is very nice costume from Michael Wilkinson who did TRON: Legacy, Terminator Salvation and Watchmen, there is so much detail and effort to those girl's costume.<br/><br/>The fight choreographer and stunt coordinator Damon Caro who did The Bourne Ultimatum which is very nice.<br/><br/>Visual Effects is good, especially the Japanese soldiers scene, the dragon and the pink rabbit robot, they are nice design.<br/><br/>The music score, i don't think is suitable, I really don't like it<br/><br/>The camera work is good, is exciting, such as the shot that on back stage make-up room mirror, Sweet Pea is talking to Rocket before Baby Doll come in talking about ""the 4 items"" the shot is so smooth.<br/><br/>By the way i vote it 8.

"The-Sarkologist","9","2","5","9 December 2013"," An Epic Movie of Psychological Intensity
","It seems like the critics simply did not like this movie, but then again I have never been one to agree with the critics. I like to make my mind up myself, and to be honest, I thought that this film was brilliant.<br/><br/>It is interesting that the song that I am listening to while I am writing this analysis is called 'Dreams in my Fantasy' as this is what this film is about, dreams in one's fantasy world, but the world in which the characters inhabit is a very dark and dangerous world that they are seeking an escape from.<br/><br/>The movie exists on three levels, the insane asylum (which is reality), the brothel, and the war zone. The film begins in reality, but as soon as the main character (who doesn't have a name) is settled into the asylum, the movie shifts to the brothel and it is from the brothel that the bulk of the movie is set. To me it appears that by shifting the movie from the asylum to the brothel ups to horror of the prison that the main character is caught in, but when she moves to make her escape, the movie shifts up another level to a war zone where they are given a mission to obtain a totem (there are four totems, a map, a key, a knife, and a fire).<br/><br/>None of the characters have names per se, but rather have monikers, which suits well in the brothel, where they are dancers, and in the war zone, where they are soldiers. However the lack of a name represents the identity of these girls being taken from them for the use of another, yet in the warzone, they are able to use the monikers to give them strength as they fight their way to obtaining the totem. Further, in reality they do not have a voice, which is another prison from which they need to escape. It is only when they are in the brothel that they gain their voice, and it is this gaining of a voice that is their first step to freedom.<br/><br/>There is actually a lot in this movie to consider, first of all the name 'Suckerpunch' which is something I will not delve into. The second is whether three of the girls actually exist at all (and I am speaking of the three girls that die in the warzone and in the brothel) leaving us with only two of them. Some have suggested that the number five is also reoccurring, which is it, however to argue that there are five realms is incorrect as I could only see three of them.<br/><br/>This is a great movie, though the title just does not seem to convey much of what is going on in the movie. The Japanese title 'Angel Wars' seems much more suitable, but would refer to the girls rather than to any supernatural element in the movie itself. It is not supernatural, but rather psychological."

","This movie appears at first glance to be a shallow attempt at parading attractive young women in corsets and other mildly sexual attire on the big screen which, whilst attracting most men, may repel some women. However, first impressions could not be more wrong. If you look past the tiny dresses and the almost Matrix like action sequences this is a multi-layered story, a dark fairy tale almost, it is at times heart wrenching and is a shocking insight into the sexual exploitation of young women and the way mental patients were treated in our hospitals in previous years.<br/><br/>I would put this film up there with films such as Pans Labyrinth and the Matrix and of course its directors predecessor 300 for both story content style and action. Congratulations Zack Snyder.<br/><br/>For anyone who has held back from watching this film because of the way the girls are presented on the posters I suggest that you watch this film as the posters are merely there to attract the men as apposed to tell you the story as that is down to you to find out."
"SoIThrewTheSenateAtHim","4","2","5","6 April 2013"," Visually impressive and rich in potential, but ultimately shallow.
","Zack Snyder's 'Sucker Punch', like his previous '300', is an action- heavy and extremely stylised movie, featuring a small group fighting a seemingly-impossible battle against an overwhelming force - in '300', the advancing and inexplicably S&M-fixated Persian hordes; here, the staff and environs of a mental hospital. <br/><br/>Most of the action takes place inside the mind of the main character Babydoll, who hallucinates an alternate world inside the asylum, in which she and her fellow inmates are instead exotic dancers in a brothel run by twisted and unpleasant representations of the already twisted and unpleasant asylum staff. Because stealing keys, maps, cigarette lighters and knives to escape with is more the area of Steve McQueen and James Garner, these escape preparations are portrayed as a further level of hallucination, in which the girls do battle in increasingly exotic locales against increasingly far-fetched adversaries (Steampunk German Zombie Soldiers from WWI, Robots, Orcs, etc.). These sections are always visually impressive, but we never really feel like we know the characters or get any sense of the characters' actions having meaningful - or at least understandable effects. When one character dies inside the futuristic battle hallucination, it represents her being caught and killed in the brothel hallucination. What this translates to in the asylum reality is anyone's guess.<br/><br/>The nested hallucinations that provide the necessary action, fantasy and easily-disposed-of CGI hordes may have been inspired by 'Inception's' dream levels, but the effects of the characters' actions and surroundings do not translate between realities anywhere near as clearly as in Nolan's film. Characterisation is paper-thin as well, with the main ensemble of girls being lucky to get more than one defining trait: one is stubbornly against escaping and wants to stay put, one is initially afraid but instilled with new hope by Babydoll's determination, and the other two are more or less interchangeably panicky and anxious. Babydoll herself has very little character, except for the ability to dance well in the brothel fantasy, which translates across to goodness-knows-what in reality. While the Spartans of '300' are similarly shallowly characterised, we didn't mind because what they were doing was important, based on history, and every actor seemed to be aware of the film's silliness and give performances that were about three billion per cent larger than life. 'Sucker Punch' could have done with some overplayed, shouty Spartans to give the proceedings some much- needed energy.<br/><br/>In the end, impressive though the visuals are and interesting though the premise is, we are simply watching characters we don't really know or care about doing things that don't really seem to matter. So why would we want to do that?"

","**SPOILER ALERT**<br/><br/>Emily Browning plays Baby Doll. A young girl who has suffered abuse from the hand of her Step Father. It is implied that her Step Father has 'bumped off' her mother for her money and is outraged when she leaves everything to her two young Daughters. During his outrage, he attempts to 'assault' Baby Doll. She scratches her Step Fathers face, and he locks her in a room before turning to her younger Sister prompting Baby Doll to escape her confinement and run to her sisters rescue by jumping from a second story window. Somehow, she acquires a gun, and while aiming at her Step Father at point blank range, she still manages to miss, accidentally killing her younger sister in the process. 'Dirty Dad' phones the Police and Baby Doll is whizzed off to the funny farm to greet her fate.. <br/><br/>All this happens within the first ten minutes. All in slow motion with an unnecessary cover of 'Sweet Dreams', performed by Emily Browning who, in my opinion, is just another one of those 'new age' singers who sing with absolutely zero amount of soul and concentrate on perfection rather than pouring emotion into their *ahem* 'material'. Most of the soundtrack is identical cover versions of classic songs, brought into the 21st century and turned to crap at the hands of inexperienced performers!<br/><br/>Anyway... Baby doll discovers that she has a 'magical power' which enables her to render any one in her immediate vicinity while she's dancing, completely powerless. During her adventure through Wonderl.. er... Neverl.. CGI land, she is accosted by a wizened old man (without beard... LACK OF CREDIBILITY) who bestows her with a ""Hitman"" style Hardballer, (with a nice little charm bracelet attached to it just to show that it's a girls gun) and a nifty little samurai sword. (That'll come in handy in the Kitchen!) The 'Wise' Man (without beard) explains that she must find four items (ssh.. the fifth one is a secret) to complete her quest, and before she can go back to the land of the living, she must defend herself against three.. well.. to be honest, I can only really describe them as 'The Shadow Demon' from ""Dragon: the Bruce Lee Story"" only three times over and 3 times the size. So after getting laced for a few minutes, she pulls off a Rocky Style comeback and canes the treacherous trio having had no previous Martial Arts or Combat Experience! Then she climbs back into herself before trying her best to explain her marvellous completely flawed and thoughtless plan to the other girls.. Who hate her for all of seven and a half minutes before they're B.F.F.F's!<br/><br/>Four items. FOUR! That's all they had to remember.. BETWEEN FIVE OF THEM! So just to make sure they remember, Baby Doll conveniently writes a list in chalk on the back of a blackboard in plain sight where anyone can find it! Why? Why would any one do that? ""SCHOOLBOY ERROR"". It's like they wrote a bad screenplay, decided to use dodgy CGI... 'obvious' CGI, and then envisioned how bad it would be, so just put all the girls in skimpy outfits to distract the viewer from the bad points. Now don't get me wrong, I like a bit of tit as well as the next guy, but after you've seen hundreds, nigh on thousands of pairs of 'funbags'... the novelty wears off. I can understand the allure of this premise to prepubescent teenagers looking to 'put one in the bank' on a lonely night, but I don't watch movies for that. If that's what I wanted, i'd watch porn like normal people do!<br/><br/>The only reason I watched Sucker Punch to the end, is because I was intrigued as to what the 'secret' item was.. As it happens, it was a huge cliché. As was the *ahem* 'twist'... if you can even call it that. The old 'the beginning is actually the end' routine. Yaaaawwn. Been there, seen that.. I gots me about 70 T-shirts to prove it! The characters did nothing to make me like them. I didn't feel like I was 'right there with them' at any point, and less than half way through I was almost shouting at the screen; ""COME ON... GET ON WITH IT!"" But they couldn't 'get on with it' because they were to busy crying at every opportunity. <br/><br/>I didn't think much of the action sequences. The choreography wasn't too bad, but I thought it was ruined by the rest of the Movie.. and wire fighting, which I loathe because it never looks fluid enough to be real. The cinematography throughout many of these sequences was spectacular. In fact, the cinematography is outstanding, and this is the only redeeming thing about ""Sucker Punch""! <br/><br/>The little 'moral' talk at the end just made me want to climb inside my monitor and just ruin the face of any passer by who just happened to be in that particular shot! Then the ending leaves it open for another installment of 'This is gunna Suck-er Punch!'<br/><br/>Im not happy with it. <br/><br/>I wont be recommending it. <br/><br/>And I wont be watching it again.<br/><br/>Ill just watch 300 with Gerard Butlers teeth playing Leonidis' Teeth!<br/><br/>4 outta 10<br/><br/>END<br/><br/>I'm Popeye Doyle and I approve of this message."
"Swidenbank","4","2","5","21 August 2011"," Interesting idea but poorly (and confusingly) executed...
","Sucker Punch is Zack Snyders first proper foray into the world of the 'written and directed by' movie makers. Following on from the critically acclaimed '300' (based on the Frank Miller graphic novel) and second comic-book adaptation 'Watchmen' Snyder has now been allowed to run riot with a story entirely of his own creating and the result is, well, a little messy. If you were told that Sucker Punch was also based on a graphic novel then it would surely garner little surprise as it shares many typical traits of that particular genre; it's effectively an action packed romp often set in ultra-fantastical locations not bound by the conventions of the real world. On top of this, the movies heroines consist of five beauties who work against their will in a gentleman's burlesque club as exotic dancers who battle foes ranging from zombie Neo-Nazis through to dragons and other bizarre creatures in a dark, magical place that exists solely within their own sub-conscious (phew!). Sounds thrilling, no? Unfortunately the wild combination of fantasy coupled with often repetitive action scenes just fail to ignite the spark that would have made this experience a remotely interesting two hours. To set the scene, Baby Doll (played by Australian Emily Browning) is institutionalised following the death of her mother and sister at the hands of her wicked step-father. Here she is scheduled for a lobotomy within days of her arrival at his request in order to wipe her memory of said events and therefore eliminating the possibility retribution or accusations of criminal behaviour towards him. Whilst there she constructs an alternate reality as a kind of coping mechanism, turning the mental hospital in which she is imprisoned into an orphanage which serves as a cover for its owners true business; being the owner of a kinky gentlemen's burlesque club. It turns out that Baby-Doll is quite the dancer (not that we ever actually get to see her dance) and along with her new-found friends they hatch a plot to escape using her dancing to distract the orderlies whilst they steal various artefacts from around the building to aid their quest. On top of this, whenever Baby-Doll dances she whisks herself away to a fantasy world where she and her newly found girlfriends fight magical creatures for the same artefacts that they are seeking in the real world although it's not actually the real world, is it..? Are you still with me..? Visually Sucker Punch is stunning; despite the fact that it feels on occasion like you're watching a computer game Snyder litters each fantasy cut-away with beautiful sets, great CGI (even close-up) and non-stop action from his scantily-clad heroines. The problem is that none of it seems to make a great deal of sense In effect we're watching a fabricated reality within a fabricated reality, but this lacks the brilliance and understandable complexity of Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' – instead it all just seems a bit silly and, unfortunately, a wee bit pointless. In addition to this, as we are well aware by now that none of what is happening is real – even for the characters in the film – it's incredibly hard to feel anything at all for any of the main players during these wild fantasy battles. It's virtually impossible to become engulfed in the death-defying and high-octane action sequences whilst the reality of the situation is constantly niggling away in the back of your mind; that you are witnessing the fantasy world of a character in a fantasy world and therefore whatever happens to any of them is probably of little consequence as nothing that is happening is actually real. Sound confusing..? It is a little but mostly it's confusing as to what Snyder was attempting to achieve with Sucker Punch. As you're never really sure what is real and what isn't, it makes it very hard to relate to any of the main characters. On top of this each of the fantasy-battle cut away scenes is incredibly similar to the last and by their third outing things have become understandably boring and repetitive; get in, fight and kill plenty of enemies in a CGI laden landscape and escape with whatever it was they're looking for. It's hard to enjoy a movie when you can't really empathise with any of the main characters, especially when their big action scenes become tedious as the film drags on It isn't until the end when connections are drawn between some of the events within the fantasy world and what has actually been happening at the mental institution, but by this point it's too little too late for Sucker Punch. Perhaps Snyder should have drawn regular reference to the happenings in the 'real world' throughout the film which would have enabled the viewer to understand and empathise with the characters as opposed to trying to be clever and hope that the movie can maintain interest until everything is tied up in the end. Unfortunately Sucker Punch falls short here and the ending is no more an enlightening epiphany than it is the thankful culmination of a visually fantastic yet frustratingly boring and overly complicated film. In all Sucker Punch isn't a horrible film – there have been many far worse attempts at a virtually entirely CGI influenced action romp – but unfortunately the story and meaning become lost in Snyders extravagant and often tedious 'action' sequences and poor attempt at a clever and meaningful story line."

","Sucker Punch is the story of a group of problematic teen girls (Baby Doll, Sweet Pea, Rocket, Blondie and Amber) trying to escape a mental institution for girls where they are abused and exploited by its director Blue Jones.<br/><br/>The start of the movie is very promising. It tells the story of how Baby Doll, the leading character, gets to the mental institution. It has a good narrative and terrific music, and, in fact, looks very much like a well-made video-clip.<br/><br/>This being a Fantasy film, you expect the unexpected and you are already open to unbelievable things to happen; however, to swallow the lot, the story needs to have an internal logic that makes it organic, and you rarely find that here beyond the opening sequence and the thin line connecting the different day-dreams. The day-dreaming scenes, are very entertaining, because, well, they are supposed to be day-dreams in which anything is possible. However, once again, thee whole seems like an extended video-clip pastiche, one moving to a different one.<br/><br/>The movie has a great concept and succeeds at creating an unique an bizarre Universe that mixes themes and aesthetics in vogue in modern pop culture (a mix of early medieval, Gothic, traditional Japanese, the 1920s and 1950s aesthetics). The special effects are great,and the action scenes are terrifically filmed, and always powered by a terrific music. However, the script is so thin, the characters so superficially drawn, the nonsense so obvious, and the pretentiousness of some scenes (the end for example) so patronizing that you cannot ignore them.<br/><br/>The acting was good on the part of the always convincing Oscar Isaac as Blue Jones, John Glenn as the Wise Man, Jena Malone as Rocket, and Amy Cormish as her sister Sweet Pea. The rest of the cast is OK: Emily Browing as melancholic Baby Doll, Vanessa Hudgengs as Blondie, Jamy Chung as Amber, and Carla Gugino as Dr. Vera Gorski. The rest of the cast seems to be more a group of extras passing by, despite the cameo of Jon Hamn.<br/><br/>I loved the soundtrack, but there is barely a rest from it. Although the lyrics of the songs are directly related to the story, the intensity of the music is overwhelming and numbing. This is a movie and you expect the music to be at the service of the story, not the opposite! <br/><br/>The fleshy flesh wasn't necessary in the story, to be honest, and it is a bit of a perverted old man's fantasy. Sorry Snyder! I found unnecessary the characters being dressed in sluttish dresses the whole time. They could have carried on the story with the girls wearing jeans and t-shirts outside their dancing areas. Insulting are those moments in which the focus of the camera goes on some of the girls' bottoms!<br/><br/>At the end of the movie I felt that the great imagination, potential and actors have been wasted by a poor direction and that Snyder is your man if you want to get a super-duper video-clip not a movie.<br/><br/>The DVD has a bonus of 4 animated short films directed by Ben Hibon (Feudal Warriors, The Trenches, Dragon and Distant Planet), which complement the day-dreaming scenes. They are good visually, full of potential, but too hurriedly done, and with paper-thin plots provided by the same director, not by the animator. You can have wonderful animation, but if you have a poor story, the rest is a waste of time, money and talent. If you cannot do something well, don't do it at all.<br/><br/>An action packed film full of fantasy, big fights, silly stories, and girls in sluttish dresses. A movie mostly for hormonal teenagers."

","A film angsty teenage girls who like emo-pop videos, combat computer games and sleepovers will love, as well as boys who desire the aforementioned girls. For some of us it will be a film that will play like those moments on American Idol when a very good singer has chosen a song we can't stand because our big sister played it four thousand times on the same day the hamster died. Granted it is often beautiful to look at: beautiful images and sequences with beautiful faces and bodies and beautiful costumes but that is all a bit wasted on a story that tries to be three layers deep but all comes off as a bass relief rather than 3D. I hate saying that. There is a wealth of ideas and not a little love put into it. Here are my if-onlies: If only it didn't remind me of those earnest theatrical plays of plays within plays (within asylums) like Marat/Sade which I knew would be good for me to see (intellectually) but found grim as homework. If only it didn't remind me how daft a lot of action films are which I don't question because they use a cool tough dude to do the far fetched nonsense and not sweet and beautiful girls. If only it didn't occasionally recall scenes from films like The Ring Trilogy, Zathura, Labyrinth and all that Terry Gilliam and Jean-Pierre Jeunet stuff so that the incredibly fertile imagination of the creators looks to have limits. (Yep, that's a back handed compliment.) If only the soundtrack didn't stick itself in your face so much and make you think they were spending whole afternoons trawling You Tube music videos instead of WORKING ON THE SCRIPT!!!! If only the Barbie Doll image for the lead girl hadn't been such a good idea on the one hand but resulted in a lack of emotional involvement on the other. If only I wasn't so critical. But these people can take it. There will be better from them in the future for sure."
"ggoncalves","10","2","5","7 August 2011"," it's a visual feast!!!
","Zack Snyder is spoiling us with great visual movies, and this one is not exception. In spite of the bad reviews by some of the so-called specialized critics the movie is quite interesting. we get to travel inside the mind of this girl called BabyDoll while she's trying to get herself free from this mental asylum that her stepfather managed to get her in, dragging at the same time the other girls that befriended with her. The catch in here is that every step towards freedom is a battle that they fight. We get to see all these actresses that we wouldn't normally see in an action/fantasy movie, and they kick-ass. Along with a great visual we get a great score, functioning perfectly. Ultimately this a movie about greed, human exploitation with a mask of respectability, survival and freedom."
"paul_haakonsen","7","2","5","19 June 2011"," The effects will ""Sucker Punch"" you into oblivion...
","If you have seen any of the trailers for ""Sucker Punch"", then you should already have a pretty good idea what you are in for before you sit yourself down to watch this movie. Because this is going to be a treat for the eyes and easy on the mind. True enough! It turned out to be exactly that...<br/><br/>""Sucker Punch"" is phenomenal in its splendors of CGI effects and wow effects. There is spared no expense when the dazzling effects are allowed to unfurl on the screen. And it totally blows you away, because it looks so amazing. From the very beginning till the very end, you are in for a very visual treat, CGI eye candy indeed. And if for nothing else, then the movie is well worth watching for the effects alone.<br/><br/>And sad to say, the effects galore is what carries most of the movie. In between the dazzling CGI effects and mind-blowing action sequences, the movie feeds you a rather dull and uninspiring story of girls locked away at a mental institution, where they plan an escape. An escape that can become reality because of Baby Doll's dancing. Stop! Are you kidding me? This is as far from any story with any depth as it can possibly be. But hey, if you have a serious case of hangovers, then the movie is right up your alley, because you need no brain to keep up with the storyline.<br/><br/>Moving on to the characters in the movie. Well, you have five heroines that are clad in fairly interesting clothing most of the time. And it being five attractive women at that, helps along to appeal to the male audience. Sure it looks good, but it just helps to throw fire on the fuel of a no-brainer movie. Now, I am not saying that Emily Browning (playing Baby Doll), Abbie Cornish (playing Sweet Pea), Jena Malone (playing Rocket), Vanessa Hudgens (playing Blondie) or Jamie Chung (playing Amber) were doing a bad job or that they are not good actresses, far from it. But it is clear to everyone why they are in the movie... Moving on! It was interesting to see Carla Gugino (playing Dr. Vera Gorski) in this movie, and her role was quite interesting. And Scott Glenn (playing the Wise Man) was a good touch to the cast list.<br/><br/>My 7/10 rating for this movie is for the extravagant CGI fest and action alone. It has long been since I have seen anything of the like as in this movie. I was totally blown away by the effects, and it is what immediately stuck with me. The movie is well worth watching for these two facts alone, because the storyline is weak and quite stupid really.<br/><br/>""Sucker Punch"" came as no surprise to me, being what it is, and living up to what I had believed it to be. But still, it is definitely a movie that you would not want to miss out on. This is hardcore CGI effects candy for the eyes, hard-pounding action, hot women and a ""click off your mind and enjoy the ride"" movie for men of all ages."
"richard_oz","7","2","5","18 May 2011"," Fun Flick
","The movie portrays itself as something a little different and that as a viewer is exactly what you get. The characters have enough personality to be of interest but none are really developed fully because of the steady pace of the action sequence that are weaved into the story line. The dream scenes are visually dazzling and the action in them top rate. The dynamic between the actresses is very much that of a team and it's impressive that many of the stunts and fight scenes were done by the actual actors in the film. I didn't find a real connection with any one of the bunch but it was a movie that was worth seeing on the big screen just for the stunning visuals. Solid Sci-fi/drama with some kick ass fighting. Worth a look."
"alexk-ronning","8","2","5","17 May 2011"," A great movie, but you have to keep your mind wide open to enjoy it.
","First off, there are A lot of negative reviews for this movie. I know, I've read them. And while I agree and support the fact that Sucker Punch is definitely not for everyone, it's still a great, unique, and entertaining movie. I don't think this is one of those films where people should say ""go in expecting nothing but CGI, loads of over the top action, and zero story,"" to me Sucker Punch was more than that. No other movie has had me lost for words at the end. I've always enjoyed venting my opinions to people straight after I've seen a movie, but this was different. I had no idea what to say. Hopefully I can muster up some sort of explanation that will encourage you to see the movie though, so I'll do my best. Sucker Punch's story is a unique one, again, not to everyone's taste. A girl's wicked stepfather abuses and beats her and her sister, until one day he beats her sister to death. This girl, nick named ""Baby Doll"" attempts to shoot her wicked stepfather, but fails, and so he puts her in a mental institution. Pretty bleak right? At the mental institution, Baby Doll meets some other girls who agree to try and escape with her. Pretty much most of the movie is spent in this alternate reality in which the girls imagine themselves. There are a few layers of this, and it leaves a lot to the imagination and personal opinion on what is actually happening. As I said, you have to have a REALLY open mind, otherwise this movie will fail you, like the critics who were being far too skeptical. Well obviously, there's the reality. Then there's the second layer where the girls imagine themselves, the mental institution is now a brothel where they work, and the leader of the institution is now a mobster. The third layer is where things get exciting, and Zack Snyder's imagination gets unleashed. For those who don't know, this is his first film without any sort of source material to base it on. To escape from the asylum, our leads need to find 5 items, and each time they go for an item, they imagine this crazy fantasy world with zombies, dragons, robots, samurai, and many other things which aren't normally seen in the same film together. Whatever happens in the fantasy world, vaguely mirrors reality. That went on a while, so I hope I've made the plot clear enough. Some people may not like having to have such an open mind, but the way I see it, you needed it for Inception, and that was one of the best movies of 2010. Same goes with Sucker Punch. I actually really loved the story, it took me a while, but the full effect of the movie came after I'd finished watching it, and I immediately wanted to see it again. But for most, the story wont be the attraction as much as the crazy, fantastical action sequences. These are just insane. Extremely imaginative, Zack Snyder handles his action so well, there is plenty of slow motion and CGI, all used to brilliant effect. The crazy stuff that is actually in this movie, I've never seen altogether in one film before. It's ridiculous, but it works, and the film is worth seeing for the action scenes alone if you're in to that sort of thing. All the acting was great in my opinion, I really liked Emily Browning here. A very broken character, she plays it very well. The music was also a highlight here, I don't usually pay much attention to stuff like that in movies, but here I couldn't help it. Just brilliant, matches the tone of the film perfectly and really enhances the motion often going on on the screen. A lot of it is just covers of classic songs, but again, it all works very well. Wrapping up now, Sucker Punch is DEFINITELY not for everyone. A lot of people wont enjoy this, and I see why. It just isn't to everyone's taste, but I strongly recommend you give it a try. If you wanted to see it, but weren't sure because of the negative response, see it. And apparently, there were a lot of highly important scenes that Zack Snyder had to cut out that will all be available on the DVD release. Every single one. The story is a little hard to grasp sometimes, and I'm pretty sure the DVD release will fix all these problems. So if you're still not sure, wait for that, it will almost definitely be a better, and easier to understand movie."
"lyzaard","8","2","5","25 April 2011"," Sucker Punch -- A Nuanced Film
","Sucker Punch is a nuanced film -- no, really, it is. Sure, the nuance gets drowned out in the middle, and any and all subtlety gets hauled into the back seat for the most brutal of make- out sessions, as the hyper-jacked mash-up escapism takes center stage, and the film does devolve there for a bit -- but the film starts out nuanced and ends nuanced. Really it does. <br/><br/>I feel much of this film was lost on the average film critic, much like DMX is lost on my grandfather. It certainly wasn't made for the critics. It's rabidly apparent that Snyder made this film as a celebration piece for juvenile horn-dogs, crazy kids well-versed in handling ADHD-spiked Code Red and persistent sexual frustration. This is the ultimate geek film. I liked it. So I'm a geek then, so what?<br/><br/>As universal fare, I understand that Sucker Punch has major flaws, but for what it was trying to be, for who it was designed to appeal to, it really is close to flawless.<br/><br/>The critics who hated this film, not so much the ambivalent ones, but the critics who hated it, strike me as anachronistic, unable to tolerate the mind-numbing overkill that's beautifully painted upon the canvas of Baby Doll's psyche. I'd say, if you can't handle said overkill, then you're not a member of the target audience.<br/><br/>I think if I were a fifteen-year-old boy, it would have been the greatest, sexiest thing I'd ever seen -- and that's cool. Hats off to Snyder for providing today's fifteen-year-old boys with such. Just because we jaded adults perceive something as meaningless doesn't mean that the first etchings into the tabula rasa of a teen viewer can't be genuinely meaningful.<br/><br/>Snyder is an auteur -- sure, the story-telling is confusing, and at times flawed, but for those who put a little time in, it's there for the taking. There's a nice open interpretability to it, which allows each viewer to take away what they want to take away. Check it out a second time, and tell me you don't notice a lot more nuance and interconnectivity and sense. Though, with all that said, I do still have a lot of questions.<br/><br/>The elements of this film that I most enjoyed, I enjoyed to the point where I was entirely willing to give Snyder a pass on the flaws. The only real flaws that I'll concede here: a confusing story, action scenes too syrupy, and at times paper-thin characters. But in the end, this is all taking place in the head of a lobotomized girl, so it all makes perfect sense to me. Call it a cop out, call it what you will, I think it worked fine (for what it was).<br/><br/>Contrary to some reviews I've read, the film does differentiate between what happens in the asylum and what happens in the brothel. I didn't get that as much during my first viewing, but going in knowing what to expect, my mind was better primed to pick up on the subtle hints here and there -- and they most certainly are there.<br/><br/>My take on the film is now: Baby Doll was committed to the asylum, learned that she had just five days to escape before a scheduled lobotomy, and in those five days she somehow stole a lighter, a knife, the map and the key, and freed the girl we know in the brothel as Sweet Pea. How she does it all is not the two hours traffic for our stage -- how her lobotomized mind recounts it, that is what we are shown. There is no happy ending, there is only Baby Doll in ""paradise"" imagining the Guardian Angel further helping Sweet Pea to her freedom. There is only Baby Doll's mangled mind hoping that Sweet Pea actually made it all the way back home.<br/><br/>Baby Doll's ""paradise"" is a world where she dreams she has the power to dance incredibly, and in her dreams twice-removed, has the power to defy any and all forces opposed (gravity, time, death). Her dream-worlds are not without kinks though, as this is her mind recounting her last five days of reality, amplified tenthousandfold.<br/><br/>I'd give Sucker Punch an 8/10. It's not perfect, certainly, but all in all I was very impressed with Snyder's creative vision. I was surprised as to how successfully the critics stopped this one in its tracks. Sans critics, I think this film would have done at least twice as well at the box office. In the end, it's certain to garner a huge cult following -- that's another comment you can file away under ""unarguable.""<br/><br/>Apparently, there's some countless number of jaded/bitter critics out there -- not to include my Scorecard Review brethren, you guys were fair-- but this film received so many biting reviews, mean-spirited and soulless, I'd call 'em. I was entirely shocked as to how many critics truly hated this film. I cannot relate in the slightest to the critics who called this film exploitative, demeaning, or misogynistic. It's as misogynistic as Twain's Huck Finn is racist. Get over it.<br/><br/>Thankfully, I'm still fresh enough to this world where beauty (feminine and otherwise) and satisfactorily employed music do act as effective stand-ins for story and depth and dialogue. ""Sacrilege!"" Many will call for my head."
"xenomorph_uk","9","2","5","19 April 2011"," I thought it was fantastic
","This is certainly one of my favourite action movies in recent years. <br/><br/>It's pretty clear from the commercials that they're targeting a largely male audience and from that standpoint, it doesn't fail to please. There have been many recent movies that are clearly targeted at the female audience such as the Twilight series, Red Riding Hood etc... so we've earned this one ;)<br/><br/>First of all, I was thoroughly impressed by the sets and attention to detail. The level of originality is extremely high with lots of mixed technologies and eras. <br/><br/>The sound track was absolutely spot on. It's rare to find a score that fits and actually intensifies the various scenes. <br/><br/>Sure, the acting was pretty poor to average, but was frankly just about what I expected. Despite that I found that I cared about some of the main characters and found them quite interesting. <br/><br/>The story is pretty open-ended and leaves you to make your own mind up about much of what transpired. The transition scene from asylum to brothel is a little abrupt though and leaves you somewhat displaced for a while. <br/><br/>Overall, I got exactly what I expected and more from this film. Fun action, original scenes and some seriously hot eye-candy ;) Most guys around my age will definitely enjoy this title. <br/><br/>Story : 6 Acting : 5 Visual Effect : 9 Sound Track : 10 Originality : 9"
"bmhill-23-403272","6","2","5","9 April 2011"," Wait for Sucker Punch: The Extended Director's Cut (with an extra 18 minutes)
","I saw Sucker Punch last night at the theater and while I was impressed by what I saw, I couldn't help but feel that something was missing. Parts of the film seemed rushed and what I felt was the best part of the movie, the character development and interactions in the brothel and even the earlier part in the insane asylum seemed unnecessarily brief. Also in the credits at the end of the movie we got a glimpse at dance numbers that seemed rather elaborate and where obviously meant to be in the film (you can also see parts of them in the movie trailers).<br/><br/>After getting home I decide to do a search online to see if there was any plans to release an extended director's cut on Blu-ray, and to my (not so) surprise, yes indeed there are. Before the film even came out there was plans to release an extended director's cut (with an extra 18 minutes) on Blu-ray and DVD.<br/><br/>I saw a couple of interviews with the director Zack Snyder, where he talked about a director's cut on Blu-ray, and the trial and tribulations of getting the film released with a PG-13 rating at the theater. I also saw a comment from Deborah Snyder (producer) that states specifically that there will be a extended directors cut on Blu-ray and DVD. From there comments I also got a sense that all the extra scenes that I wanted in the theatrical version will be in the director's cut (including more action).<br/><br/>So my suggestion is if you want to see the definitive version of Sucker Punch wait for the Extended Director's Cut and even if you where less than impressed with the theatrical version I would suggest checking out the Extended Director's Cut when it comes out.<br/><br/>The theatrical release I give a 6 out of 10, but I believe that an extended director's cut will more than likely get a 8 out of 10."
"iReviewFilms","5","2","5","8 April 2011"," Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Sucker Punch
","Sucker Punch intrigued me before its release due to the seemingly random storyline and what looked like impressive graphics. So I sat down to watch it wondering whether I was going to enjoy the story it has to tell or be confused by it. Unfortunately it was the latter. Now I try and find both positives and negatives in everything I review but graphics aside (which were very enjoyable to watch and engaging) I struggled to for Sucker Punch.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch revolves around Baby Doll (Emily Browning) who is imprisoned in a mental asylum by her wicked and abusive stepfather so that he can lay claim to an inheritance meant for her and her sister. Whilst in the asylum she retreats to a fantasy world of a brother and then further again (Inception-esque) through the medium of dance while her attractive and scantily clad new found friends assist her in her quest to break out of the asylum/brothel and gain freedom. Still with me? Good.<br/><br/>It is quite obvious that this movie comes from the same director (Zach Snyder) that brought us 300 as the return of the super slo-mo fight scenes have arrived in abundance as they did in 300. I have to say they work well in the action scenes in the fantasy world but are also used when no action is taking place... the film could cut 10 minutes from its 110 by just running those parts at normal speed with no real loss.<br/><br/>Now I'm not sure whether I just completely missed the point of this movie or not but I don't want to have to watch it for a second time to find out. Usually I would warn of spoilers but there can't really be any when there is no plot in the first place and the scenes are so random and disjointed that nothing really makes sense. I got the logic behind the desperation of Baby Doll needing to escape her reality as a way of coping but come on she can only do this through dance? And when she is dancing this puts every man in the real world into some sort of a trance? So on the positive side then the graphics do drag this movie upwards in the ratings with the overall CGI action being very impressive covering a plethora of locations and situations. Even so the graphics did not really add much to the story. Don't get me wrong they were great and I enjoyed the scenes but I got the feeling that Snyder just put them in because he could when he should have perhaps been concentrating slightly more on developing the characters and making us care about them.<br/><br/>Finally my last gripe with this movie is that you never think that the girls are in any danger during the fight scenes and so even if you did end up caring whether they die of not, they don't look like they are ever going to making the slo-mo bullets and swords kind of pointless.<br/><br/>Despite impressing with graphics, the plot and acting are poor, you never invest in the characters well-being and the graphics seem to be surplus to the movie anyway. If the graphics were the punch then the rest of the movie was definitely the suck.<br/><br/>For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com"

","Wow. I watched this not expecting much, but was still disappointed. This movie is incredibly bad. So devoid of substance it could be a Michael Bay movie. Sorry, that's not entirely correct: Michael Bay movies have more of a semblance of a plot.<br/><br/>What a mess. Calling the plot ""random"" flatters it. If Zack Snyder had a plan, it is not obvious. At best he was trying to make Girl Interrupted meets Lara Croft meets Inception. That's how muddled it is.<br/><br/>More likely, like Michael Bay, Zack Snyder was just trying to show off his CGI and explosion-making skills. Screw the plot. <br/><br/>Either that or this is the longest ever advert for a first-person- shooter computer game.<br/><br/>Performances from Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish and Jena Malone aren't bad though, especially considering how little they had to work with. <br/><br/>Avoid like the plague."

","I really don't know what to think of this movie, but based on gut instinct I'd say I liked it. Just wasn't really what I was expecting. It was a lot more dark and depressing than I expected or was led to believe. That's not a bad thing, but it definitely took me by surprise. It's one of those movies where every little thing means something or is symbolic. Some are so obvious it's cringe-worthy, and others that you really have to think about.<br/><br/>I'm glad there was a fair share of character development to go along with all the action. Really got invested in their stories which was nice. Babydoll, Sweet Pea, and Rocket were the real leads. Amber and Blondie have a few nice moments, but mostly stood around unfortunately. Blue was just repulsive. Acting was strong. The supporting cast, especially Jena Malone and Abbie Cornish, stood out the most. Vanessa Hudgens surprised me. Emily Browning wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, but was still pretty good.<br/><br/>The action scenes were pretty hit or miss. There was one that was one of the best I've seen on film, another that was just plain awful, and the others were must 'meh'. Very style-ish. Sometimes a little TOO much style though.<br/><br/>So yeah, Sucker Punch is good. The concept is excellent, there's a lot to think about, some good characters....

"andrew_hawkins","3","3","10","17 January 2015"," Overindulgent and Infantile Brain Garbage
","The idea here is simple. We the audience want to be entertained by what we like. We like action. We like sex. We like conflict and resolution. What could go wrong?<br/><br/>The style and substance of Sucker Punch is overwhelming. So much is being thrown in the viewer's face that one becomes immediately desensitized and bored by the whole affair. Right out of the gate this movie establishes that nothing is really happening here and the stage has been set for a play that never once connects with it's audience. It's hard to imagine that a movie so filled with everything including the kitchen sink could be so boring and tedious. There's no connection here. The effort made to sit through Sucker Punch is a wasted investment.<br/><br/>What happens? Doesn't matter. Who's in it? Scott Glenn and pretty girls. Any good action? There's a small bit on a train that gets help from a Vangelis-like bit of film score, but other than that, no.<br/><br/>There's something odd about the way Sucker Punch plays out. The movie is definitely influenced by video games. There are many levels and sub-levels in the outline of the story. We start off on a stage with a set that transitions into a tragedy. The tragic play then becomes a burlesque drama which sets up four isolated action scenes that include our primary group of characters. Each sequence where our girls are running around shooting stuff and hitting things starts with a poorly remixed or covered song.<br/><br/>The worst bastardization of any song on this soundtrack is the horrible version of The Stooges Search And Destroy that bookends the Dragon/Fire level. It's pathetic. The poor Pixies cover and the Army Of Me mistake don't fare much better. The issue though is that when you hear the god-awful White Rabbit rendition stop a couple minutes into the action, you can anticipate the end of the scene as soon as the music kicks in again. Each shitty live-action video game scene in this movie is a music video with a break in the middle to keep each song from lasting fifteen minutes.<br/><br/>Really though, anybody who would watch this over a double feature of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Showgirls should burn their wallet and quit their job. Sucker Punch is a neutered PG-13 trashcan full of misplaced efforts and missed opportunities. It is a polished turd."

","A toxic blend of music video and video game set the tone for this juvenile bore, about a girl thrown in a mental institution and retreats into her mind - which happens to be the mind of a 12 year old boy who loves overblown CG action and hot girls in minimal, tight clothing. Zack Synder made a colossal miscalculation directing this picture. It's many steps backward from his previous film Watchmen and he seems proud of Sucker Punch's lack of substance so he can indulge his love of video game fetishistic action. Sucker Punch is as light as a feather -- it's a couple of disconnected cartoon action sequences bookended with a few scenes at a mental institution. This is the kind of indulgent train wreck that can derail careers and since Synder came away from this stinker with his career intact, I can only hope he got this crap out of his system and will never repeat the mistakes he made with Sucker Punch."

","I stuck this one out until the end but I couldn't get into it and ended up hating every minute. I appreciate the thought and gesture going into the basic concept, involving girls in a hellish mental institute retreating into a reality-mirroring fantasy landscape where they can take out their anger on a series of artificial enemies, but seriously? The execution is never aimed above the level of your average 14-year-old boy.<br/><br/>Zach Snyder made this after the comic-book double-act of 300 and WATCHMEN, two films which I liked a lot, but SUCKER PUNCH falls flat because it's inane. It's an endless series of CGI-augmented fight scenes in which a group of scantily-clad women fight off various CGI nasties. It's the sort of film that sets the cause of feminism back 20 years and ends up demeaning the cast at the same time.<br/><br/>Critically, it's also exceptionally dull. I think Snyder is a gifted and sometimes visionary director, but he struggles to bring the material to life and it's never more than two dimensional. The endless action sequences look good and are filled with pretty effects but they're senseless and mean nothing. The acting, of course, is horrid, from the interchangeable girl group to the incredibly hammy Oscar Isaac.<br/><br/>In all honesty, I think SUCKER PUNCH is a film best forgotten about. Even Corey Yuen's ultra-cheesy DEAD OR ALIVE is better than this..."

","¨ Who teaches us what's real, and how to laugh at lies? Who decides why we live, and what we'll die to defend? Who trains us, and who holds the key to set us free? It's you. You have all the weapons you need. Now fight! ¨ Zach Snyder has adapted various graphic novels into films in the past and I enjoyed his movies very much; I was a big fan of 300 and Watchmen and I thought those movies were terrific. In Sucker Punch Snyder tries something new; he wrote the story instead of adapting another novel, but still tried to give it the same feel and look his other films had. The look of the film is also stylish, full of CGI, and the graphics make us think we are playing a video game instead of watching a movie. This style worked for me in the past because Snyder's stories were interesting. In Sucker Punch I just couldn't get into the story, I didn't like any of the characters, and thought the plot was just ridiculous. The approach was also very hypocritical because the movie tries to preach about female empowerment and girl power, but the entire time the movie is targeted towards a male audience; we have girls fighting in short skirts, and the male characters have little screen time. I can see how this movie might be enjoyed by a young male audience, but it just didn't work for me. Comparing it to 300 and Watchmen this movie doesn't even come close, but even before watching Sucker Punch I had lowered my expectations with the trailer. I understood the metaphor and ideas the story was trying to get across, but it was just meaningless with these characters since they weren't even developed at all. There was not one interesting character, they were all one dimensional. The screenplay was adapted by Snyder himself and Steve Shibuya, but the entire movie relies only on the CGI.<br/><br/>Baby Doll (Emily Browning) is sent to a mental asylum by her stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) after her mother dies and she accidentally kills her little sister while trying to protect her from her abusive stepfather. She was aiming at him, but she missed and her little sister suffered the consequences. Baby Doll is institutionalized and in five days the doctor will perform a lobotomy on her so that she forgets everything her stepfather has done. Blue (Oscar Isaac) receives an important amount of money from the stepdad to make sure the doctor signs the OK for the lobotomy. Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino who also starred in Watchmen with Snyder) never signs the petition because Blue falsifies the signature and so everything is set for within five days when the Doctor (Jon Hamm) comes back. Baby Doll isn't alone in the asylum. She befriends four other female companions: Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) and her sister, Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), and Amber (Jamie Chung who was recently seen in The Hangover 2). Baby Doll decides to create an alternate reality in order to avoid her pain and guilt. In this fantastical world she becomes a sort of warrior and with the help of a Wise Man (Scott Glenn) she comes up with a plan to escape the mental facility. Along with her four friends they go on a mission to retrieve the five elements they will need in order to escape. In this fantastical world they have to face ninja robots, Nazi zombie's and different kind of monsters. The lines between fantasy and reality begin to blur as they try to collect the items and break free from the asylum.<br/><br/>The characters are so poorly developed that I really didn't care whether or not they escaped the institution. Even the fantasy clips in which all the main action and cool effects take place felt more like music videos due to the loud music and video game style graphic. The movie is empty; simply eye candy and I couldn't see anything philosophical or deep about it. I really was disappointed with this movie, but I know Zach Snyder will bounce back. He should stick to graphic novels. As for the performances there was nothing remarkable about any of them, but the cast isn't to blame because the entire movie relied only on the special effects and not on trying to develop the characters. The effects are interesting at some times, but we've seen them all before and there is nothing new to Sucker Punch. This will definitely be on my list of worst films of the year; it was a huge disappointment for me. Everyone has the right to make a bad film; even Pixar came short with Cars 2 so I don't think Zach Snyder should be worrying about how things turned out in Sucker Punch. Some young males might want to check this movie out, but I wouldn't recommend it.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","First of all SPOILER. STOP READING IF YOU Haven't SEEN IT YET/PLAN TO SEE IT.<br/><br/>My friends finally conviced me to go watch this movie. I deeply regret waisting $3 whole dollars on this movie, the things I could of done with 2 hours... not to mention I made an account just to review this movie. (Military base if you were wondering how I piad $3 to see the movie) Anyways, where to start? I think I'd be better off rating this movie by sections and then explaining my answers.<br/><br/>Expectations- Didn't have any going into the movie.<br/><br/>Hot girls? YES.<br/><br/>Action? YES Realism? NEVER.<br/><br/>Effects: Lots of explosions but once again very fake/unreal.<br/><br/>I have to say, because I went into this movie with no expectatons I cant complain too much. Although the sad thing is I only have one good thing I can say about this movie, decent looking girls to look at the whole movie. (One being Vanessa Hudgens) If I went into this movie expecting a good movie, then I would give this movie 2 stars just for not loosing my attention for TOO long. Anyways overall this movie had a lot of action, very random and dragged out unneeded/unreal fight scenes but the story is actually OK, and only OK. If I were to go really into details I would say the worst part about the movie is that the Dance Girl ""Protector"" knows they stole/looked at the map, and also took a GOLD lighter (unkown cost) and assumed that they didn't take the knife, yet never even LOOKED for any of the items. All I have to say is go into this movie with low expectations and come out of them with... well... a poorly made movie that just took your lunch money. People are making tons and tons of money from this movie, I'm pretty sure half of the critics on this site could come together and make a half decent movie better than this one. Anyways enough with the dragging on, go see the movie, but sneak in if you can, its not worth your dollar."

","Suckerpunch.....in a word, Awesome! Was way better than expected. From reading critic reviews that bashed the film for being choppy and having a sub-par story I was just prepared for a movie with action scenes with a little dialogue to get you through till the next action sequence. This story is like metaphors built on other metaphors, if you weren't paying attention enough you would've missed something that becomes relevant in a later scene or at the end of the movie. Sorta like how Inception had 3levels; 1.reality 2.dream 3.dream within a dream Suckerpunch has reality, sub-reality and then the fantasy world being imagined. <br/><br/>Action scenes were EPIC and stunning I am pretty sure I did not blink O_o. From the first battle with the 3 samurai warriors in the dream world, fighting zombie soldiers in the trenches of WW1, battling Orcs, medieval warriors and dragons to faceless cyborgs aboard a speeding bullet train with a bomb set to go off. Each battle takes place in a diff ""world"" and acts as metaphors themselves. Acting wasn't great but good overall, supporting characters did their part and Emily Browning as the main character Babydoll was effective. The soundtrack for the movie was original and used as a storytelling device to drive certain scenes, 2 songs were done by Browning herself, 1 by Carla Gugino and Oscar Issac while the others were various remixes of songs. <br/><br/>Only after the movie was over and I was discussing it with friends we realized all the little details and metaphors that were in this movie like POW! an unexpected punch to the face. Is that why Snyder chose Suckerpunch as the title of this movie? Maybe, maybe not but when you think about it that way the title makes sense. In interviews for this movie they kept saying ""it isn't linear"" and I was like wtf does that mean and well now I know, its how YOU yourself interpret the movie. In the end my loyalty to Snyder paid off and I did not regret spending the money to see this as it is still on my mind at this very moment. <br/><br/>All of the above is why I guess this movie has good user reviews compared to ""professional critics"" ;) cheers."
"curtydc","8","3","10","29 March 2011"," Not for the mindless majority
","I don't have a lot of fancy words to shovel down your throat, but I'm still going to throw my opinion into the ring.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this flick. From start to finish I found it engaging, telling, and entertaining. The music was great and set the pace for much of the film. It's not quite on the same scale as Daft Punks' Tron Legacy score, but the opening sequence with it's accompanying track are perfect. The effects in this movie are impressive and not overdone, I never felt like this movie was trying too hard. The otherworldly scenes came and went without being too short, or too long, but felt just right and delivered what I came to expect from the incredible trailers leading up to this film. I loved each character, they all stood out as individuals, but stood together as a great cast, oh and they looked really good. The story outside the action sequences is where the mindless are going to be left behind, if you came to this film with only the expectations of pure sexy action, then you will be unprepared, and you will get sucker punched. This film delivers so much more than that, it's got bone, flesh, and blood. In other words, it's got a plot that isn't paper thin, and a fleshed out storyline, something not many action flicks bring to the table these days.<br/><br/>I felt this movie paced itself just right, it had action, it had story, it had intelligent characters. I'm a fan of Snyder's work, I loved 300, found Watchmen to be watchable, and I loved Legend of the Guardians. Sucker Punch is a great addition to Snyder's portfolio. I can't wait for this films BD release, because I'm sure Snyder will deliver even more with special/extended content."
"ggood1234","3","3","10","29 March 2011"," Snyder great at interpreting already great content, poor at writing his own
","While Snyder may have been great at interpreting already great content (most recently 3 acclaimed graphic novels) into films, he seems to have done a poor job at writing his own. Much of the camera work from his last three films was taken shot for shot from the panels of said graphic novels. Not to diminish his skill when it comes to visuals, because Sucker Punch does have that, at least.<br/><br/>That said, I am the target demographic for this film. I'm into almost every fantasy element portrayed in this film, but it just didn't work. The story was bad. Very bad. And Scott Glenn's dialog was cringe worthy.<br/><br/>And one thing about the film I can't figure out, why did they apparently shoot elaborate nightclub scenes with choreography, costumes, etc., and then only show them in passing during the credits?! The film would have been much richer for it (though it still wouldn't have saved the story).<br/><br/>I'm bummed I paid to see it in IMAX, and honestly, I'd struggle to even watch it on Netflix knowing what I know now. Skip it!"
"nathanschubach","3","3","10","28 March 2011"," ADD movie for the fragile-minded teenagers of the world...life is so unfair.
","This movie is quite the polarizing model for movie-fans. I guess it's made for teenagers who haven't seen this stuff before and don't appreciate the music that was lazily covered in some sad-sap way. Honestly, I thought there were some scenes that really showed how well the imagery of the special effects worked, but you can tell that the film-effects team was just working on montages to try and get them into a movie, no matter what the story was.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning, the movie feels incredibly jarring. You're forced to watch a super-stylized music-video of a movie for the next 109 minutes complete with mediocre covers of great songs and one actual song (Bjork's ""Army Of Me"" with its painfully obvious lyrics of self- discovery linking to the story). Emily Browning looks like a girl with a stomach-ache throughout the entire movie, possibly because the noxious eye-glue on those ridiculous fake eyelashes was getting to her brain.<br/><br/>Her looks aside, I LOVED the fight sequence between her and 3 mystical samurai warriors, even though one was packing a minigun and couldn't hit the broadside of a barn. Synder's slow-down/speed-up effects are so annoying, it actually makes me want to go watch ""Crank,"" a movie I loathe, but at least the effects serve a purpose in that movie.<br/><br/>This one honestly felt from beginning to end how I felt in high school, all gothed out and emo, but now that I'm 30 years old, it's looks painfully pathetic and boring. I honestly yawned 6 times in the last 30 minutes of the movie, even during some action sequences, partly because I already understood what the crux of her problem was but didn't really care. Was the movie all that deep? Depends how old you are, and a good movie shouldn't depend on that crutch.<br/><br/>And as Bjork's song is shoved down your throat one last time as you walk out during the credits, all you hear are the cries of fake confidence: ""If any of you complain once more, you'll meet an army of me."" Well, I'll take that bet. See it in the theaters or IMAX for the visuals, but try not to fall asleep."

"kryptostang","8","3","10","26 March 2011"," True to its purpose.
","I've seen a lot of reviews lately hating on the haters who want a good plot in their action movies, telling them that they simply need to ""suspend"" their disbelief. How many times must we do this before we lose track of what really makes a good movie? Big names and explosions don't give any reason or excuse for a film to not have a plot or meaning. Sorry folks, that's not a movie you are watching, it's a nice soundtrack and a whole lot of TNT on set. Your seven to nine dollars is better spent elsewhere to further your intellect. <br/><br/>However, I am pleased to announce to all you action junkies and more sophisticated, plot-wanting movie goers alike, there is a decent amount of both in this mind-bending adventure, albeit a little more of the former. The story is set in no time, within five minutes of the opening scene one realizes what is most likely going to end up happening. However, the story stays true to its purpose and doesn't linger on unnecessary flashbacks, thoughts, or fills. No, like the characters that it portrays, the story moves without a dull moment with a purpose not seen in movies like these very often. Pounding through obstacles and trials, it carries an audience through each scene with a gritty grace that matches the setting wonderfully.<br/><br/>Don't lose hope now all you testosterone-filled he-men out there. This only means that all those explosions, guns, and slo-mo action scenes make sense and are happening for a reason. Let me tell you that there are enough of them to make even the biggest dreamer satisfied. I should know, I'm one of them. You guys know that feeling when it seems that you could have directed that part in the movie it matched your style so perfectly? There were a few of those in this one. I almost could feel Zach Snyder reading my mind asking me how to make certain fight scenes. Crazy stuff. But you all know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>The movie does not apologize for what it is. The noir feel of the lens and ironic choices of music combine for a great cinematic experience. It is definitely an eye opener and should keep one in their seat, if for nothing else, the filming style. <br/><br/>Bottom line? Watch it. But be careful if you have younger ones as it has a PG-13 rating, but some of the story can get a little um... risqué. A few foul words too. Just sayin'. <br/><br/>If you appreciate it as nothing else. Respect it as an art. It was beautifully directed and deserves to at least be given a shot. Excuse the pun."

"darkraven_109","2","3","11","17 April 2011"," Sadly far from anything anyone expected
","I remember watching the trailers of SUCKER PUNCH with teenage glee; chain gun wielding samurais, zombie soldiers, action girls, you name it. This movie seemed like anime, video games and action packed ultra-violence combined into an original story as crazy and visionary as INCEPTION directed by Zack Snyder, the guy responsible for 300 and WATCHMEN. This was a dream of a movie and I was willing to spend money on the ticket.<br/><br/>And then I watched it.I hate to say this about one of my favorite directors but I think Zack Snyder is beginning to lose his touch. My biggest complaint is that the film was dumbed down to a PG-13 rating. PG-13 movies are not bad (INCEPTION) but I feel that Snyder's style can do a lot better in the R rated zone, not in the kid friendly-action level. Not EVERY movie has to be in PG-13 and thanks to that Snyder's visions of action packed violence are not fully unleashed.<br/><br/>The story has a great premise but it's the script that falters. Most of the lines the girls say are predictable and clichéd at times and to make matters worse, they were acting as emotional as a block of wood. Despite the interesting cast of characters, not one of them gets really attached to the viewer since they're just standing there looking cool and pretty holding whatever weapons they have.<br/><br/>And now on to the film's main selling point: the heavily advertised four different battlefields each featuring different enemies ranging from a train full of robot soldiers to dragons fighting Word War II bombers. While awesome to look at, sadly, even the action wasn't good. The pacing was too slow obviously lacking the Snyder style adrenaline and violence viewers got to see in 300 and as mentioned earlier, the action could've been a lot better if Snyder chose to keep the R rating instead of demoting it to a PG-13. It's like DIE HARD 4 all over again; SUCKER PUNCH doesn't even feel like a Snyder film, it only LOOKS like it. To make matters worse, the dream sequences seemed forced; without them the movie would've been an average prison break movie and nothing would fall. <br/><br/>Hate to say this but the most entertaining parts of the film were OUTSIDE of the action packed dream realms; you know there's a problem with an action movie if the non-action scenes are more entertaining than the fight scenes.<br/><br/>Overall I had high hopes for SUCKER PUNCH and in the end they were all for naught. I wanted to like this film so much but I couldn't. The story was weak and the action was just sad to look at. The PG-13 rating shot down any potential the film had in realizing its full potential as an action film and the script could've taken the time to at least be improved. I just hope that Zack Snyder returns to his old self in future films since it's expected that the next SUPERMAN won't be a heavy R rated film."

","This movie evidenced a fact of the movie world that is true nearly 100% of the time. This being whenever a film is advertised to the point where it feels like they are trying to stuff it down your throat its going to be terrible. Or just from pure repetition they are trying to wear down your sense of what a good movie is, its going to be terrible. The reason this is is the people behind the movie know that it can't stand on its own two legs so they have to force feed it to the masses. Good movies don't need to be marketed, they sell themselves, simple as that. Movies like Inception have you hooked the first time you see the 30 second mini trailer. Movies like Sucker Punch and something like Aeon Flux have to beat your skull in until any logical, cognitive ability is completely destroyed. Only then will people go see these garbage movies. Take my advice, if someone offers to pay you to sit through Sucker Punch, refuse, for your own good."

"filipemanuelneto","3","2","6","25 August 2017"," When ""Twillight Zone"", ""Charlie's Angels"" and ""Naruto"" meet each other...
","When I started watching this movie I was expecting something different than it actually was. However, I don't feel disillusioned with it because I've had very low expectations. The whole story revolves around a girl (we never know her real name but only a nickname, Baby Doll) who is hospitalized in an asylum after trying to protect her younger sister from a dangerous stepfather (responsible for their mother's death and eager to lay hands on their money). Unfortunately, the shot hits the sister and not the stepfather, who bribes the director of an asylum to lobotomize her, which would make her forget everything, nullifying her personality. From here, the film is lost as it enters a parallel universe, imagined by the girl in order to escape her own reality. The asylum ceases to be a madhouse to become into a clandestine brothel for very rich clients, and where she is forced to dance seductively. With each dance, however, she more deeply imagines surreal worlds of fighting, avoiding facing real life and feeding the dream of escaping.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is very good: high doses of good quality CGI, great cinematography with good framing and some very original camera shots, good sets, consistent and well-crafted costumes. But this isn't enough to make a good movie if we consider cinema's the art of telling a story through images, words and gestures. The script is the biggest flaw in the film: almost everything it shows is imagined inside the head of the main character, but the audience doesn't quite understand the reason that led her to such a mental escape. There is also no effort to articulate this with what happens to the character in real life. We are simply disassociated from reality, and this makes the film complicated to understand. Another problem is the lack of originality in the script, which randomly blends a huge range of influences, copied or reinvented from dozens of other films and series, such as ""Harry Potter"", ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Twillight Zone"", ""Charlie's Angels"", ""Kill Bill"", ""Naruto"", ""Dragon Ball"" etc. And everything gets worse when we see theatrical and stylized fighting scenes, clearly inspired by Japanese anime. The way the movie tries to be sexy without getting it is also unpleasant. Emily Browning is the best actress that the film presents, and her character is the one that is properly developed, but she's far from what I would call a sexy woman, and a blonde wig (looks like a cosplay) and a short skirt aren't enough to change that. At that point, she loses to the supporting cast, who compensate some lack of talent with more curvaceous bodies. The soundtrack is good, as it's consistent with the film's retro and punk environment, appearing at the right times and knowing how to disappear when its not needed."

Looking at this film, it just made me confused about the plot, because it didn't make sense on any level, and leaves a whole bunch of plot holes.

And guess what? THEY NEVER BRING IT UP AGAIN!! I kid you not! they forget it! i mean, COME ON Snyder! if people loved your work with Watchmen and 300, then why are you failing on this?!....there are other things like that, that annoyed me.....but i'll give the movie credit, it wasn't boring. it had decent action, even though it was in the mind of a little girl who's practically in her underwear (Wha?!), the acting wasn't that impressive, especially from that chick from Dragon Ball Evolution (CHI CHI MY ASS!) and this film felt more like Sailor Moon to me.....I'm not kidding. This literally feels like i've been watching an episode of Sailor Moon, stretched into 2 hours. overall, it's just a basic popcorn flick, that's just low on story, and just disappoints.

","""Sucker Punch"" has to be the most expensive movie ever made ($82 million in all) about a scavenger hunt. Babydoll (played by the really sexy Australian actress Emily Browning) gets sent into an asylum by her really evil dad so that she does not inherit her mother's property. While in the asylum, Babydoll teams up with Rocket (Jena Malone who gave a far better performance as the teen love interest in Donnie Darko), Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens of High School Musical fame), and Amber (Jamie Chung) in planning their great escape. Naturally the film also has villains, like the psychopathic Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac) and Dr. Vera Gorski (Carl Gugino doing a very bad Polish accent).<br/><br/>I personally like the first 5-10 minutes of the film with the 80s soundtrack in the background and Director Zack Snyder showing off his computer-induced cinematography skills and the last 20 minutes when they are escaping. But everything in between was quite bad. The first big problem I have with this film is the plot. Apparently this insane asylum is very difficult to escape from and you would think, therefore, that Babydoll would respond to this challenge by coming up with a very clever and original escape plan that could catch all the guards unawares. But Babydoll's escape plan, far from being grandiose on the scale of Clint Eastward's in ""Escape from Alcatraz"" (an escape film with far more excitement on a much smaller budget), is as mind numbingly simple as getting a map, a lighter, a knife and a key and then busting out. Apparently the girls will all steal these things, while Babydoll keeps the guards distracted with a strip tease. The only thing that was more ridiculous than the plan itself was that the other four girls thinking that it was such a brilliant idea. While I concede that great escape plans usually have at least a whiff of implausibility (though this one really takes the cake for implausibility), the problem with the escape plan in ""Sucker Punch"" is that it's so basic that watching this plan unfold is a lot like watching paint on a wall dry. Moreover, the screenplay writers were unable to imbue the escape scenes in ""Sucker Punch"" with suspense, with the result that the audience is given no reason to care if the girls got out of the asylum or not. The next point, in relation to the plot, is that I do not think Babydoll knows how to dance, because otherwise why substitute her dance scenes with CGI video game action scenes featuring samurais with machine guns (obviously Snyder does not know much about Japanese history), inflatable Germans (talk about being xenophobic), and a big dragon? If Babydoll is such a sexy dancer, then her dancing would have easily upstaged the video game sequences (which were below average program fair) and Snyder could have saved tens of millions of dollars on the CGI.<br/><br/>My next criticism is about the music. Aside from that 80's number in the beginning, Sucker Punch's soundtrack is terrible. I don't know when people concluded that noise could be music, but the makers of this film must have seen the wall-to-wall noise accompanying the action sequences as a thing of beauty because it pervades this film from beginning to end. The lyrics are boring and the noise that comes with it is boring. <br/><br/>Finally, many critics point to the bad acting in this film. But I think this criticism is irrelevant because the film would still be bad even if the actors were good. There is no way to deliver good performances in this film, because the plot and the dialogue are so terrible. There was also criticism that Sucker Punch is an exploitation film. Admittedly there is some exploitation, but that criticism is a bit overblown. I have seen films that are far more shamelessly exploitative than ""Sucker Punch."" The main problem with Sucker Punch is not that it is an exploitation flick mixed in with a disingenuous ""strong woman"" type of message, but rather that it's just a bad movie.<br/><br/>3.7/10"

","Sucker Punch is a stunning movie that's tries to give an inspirational message but falls a little flat on it's face. Emily Browning plays the hot and main character of Babydoll who is put in the Lennox house for the criminally insane and starts to have delusions to cope with the problems she faces, lose you yet? Yeah, part way into this film you lose interest in the story, actually if you watch the trailer you already know the entire plot, all that's left to watch is the what's in between. This movie sounds and looks beautiful (and not just because of the smoking hot leading ladies) that takes you into level upon level of delusion with repeating motifs and characters that bleed through. You don't really pull for the main characters, you actually lose track of which reality is real throughout but you love to watch the amazing special effects and the lovely ladies. A movie that might be beautiful to watch but doesn't really grab you with the story, more with cutting edge effects that actually increase in skill as the movie progresses, and scantily clad ladies that if you can find hotter ladies wearing less and kicking more ass in a movie than this, tell me, really... I'd really like to see that movie... As a warning, I must say that although the movie is only about an hour and a half, since there really isn't much of a plot the feel of the movie is much, much longer. Each level of delusion brings more and more impressive visuals but in turn loses the plot all together.<br/><br/>NOTES: Emily Browning (Babydoll), Abbie Cornish (Sweat Pea), Jena Malone (Rocket), Vanessa Hudgens (Blondie), and Jamie Chung (Amber) are some of the hottest women of our generation. Oscar Isaac (Blue Jones) is the only main character that does any acting throughout the entire movie. Jon Hamm (Doctor/High Roller) and Scott Glenn (Wise Man) are used terribly, they have such bravado and acting potential but are only used sparingly. Also have to give mad props to Tyler Bates and Marius De Vries for making an incredible soundtrack."

Zack Synder did an amazing job bringing this movie to life and it's a worth a watch just for the visuals.<br/><br/>Where this movie falls apart is with a confusing and overly complicated plot. It's just really difficult to follow what the heck is going on in this movie. This is not a casual watch. It demands your attention and if you drift off you will surely be lost quickly.<br/><br/>In a nut shell, the plot revolves around Baby Doll (Emily Browning) who is placed in a mental ward after she tried to kill her abusive step-father. While she is in the mental ward she plots her escape with some of her fellow inmates. The one weapon that she has is that when she dances, she places her captors in a hypnotic state. Once that happens, she enters a dream state where she is a powerful warrior. With the help of her friends (inmates) who also enter the dream world she has to complete various tasks to help her escape. If she completes the task in the dream world then she completes the task in real life. Confused? That's because it's confusing as hell.<br/><br/>What could have been an interesting film gets dragged down by a crazy plot that's difficult to follow, and not really worth the effort if you do manage to figure it out.

"chatoyantgaze","2","2","6","29 July 2011"," Zack Snyder's Weakest Film
","SPOILERS! SPOILERS! SPOILERS! SPOILERS! I watched this film cold; other than a few (sorely regrettable) deadpan recommendations, I otherwise had high-hopes for the feature. Snyder's previous success - Watchmen - (which I absolutely adore) blew me away. Why shouldn't Sucker Punch? Largely, poor-scriptwriting, poor-narrative and poor-characters are to blame (in my opinion).<br/><br/>Our leading-lady Emily Brown is as gorgeous as ever... but so is the rest of the cast: puppishly-cute to the degree of warm treacle poured all over a blade. Not to mention their infantile names - chiefly, Baby Doll and Sweet Pea - these knife-wielding babettes are anything but. Although Baby Doll *should* be the protagonist, she rarely speaks. And when she does, it feels like a device to further progress the plot, rather than divulge/expose some inner secret, feeling or pain. Not that I think a teary moment would have changed my opinion of her, the opening sequence just isn't enough. When the film ends on Sweet Pea - a character I barely know - I don't really give a damn.<br/><br/>Why? Sucker Punch's almost-cliché manipulation of reality feels like a B-grade homage (and it's too soon) to Inception. We start off in the dark and gloomy reality leading up to Lennox House, delve into a shared-delusion of prostitution/racketeering and end up fighting mythical battles on imaginary fronts within the imagination of someone else's imagination...<br/><br/>Are the characters in the brothel the true characters of the crazies living in Lennox House? Probably not. If, somehow, they were to integrate this reality into fact, it would have been much more dark, sadistic and probably more heart-wrenching. Is this all inside the head of our protagonist? How can it be, she's not insane - she was put there by her father! All of it takes place in-between a lobotomy's final blow: and I can understand the flashback ""life-before-your-eyes"" sequence... but it just didn't quite work for me.<br/><br/>What did? Donnie Darko's ex, that's who. And Scott Glenn. They're pulling one huge star behind them both, simply because they appear the real deal. Who doesn't want a Scott Glenn caricature/""angel"" helping them fight for their sanity (an entirely flawed premise to begin with, think about it...) So when Jena Malone's character gets stabbed by an angry chef (think 300 without the-teeth-and-chains-guy). And dies. That's where I lose interest. Dialogue-wise, this beauty really had the most to offer - even if it was riddled with cliché.<br/><br/>Blah.<br/><br/>There's so much potential in this film, but it gets overloaded with eye-popping sequences and scantily-clad women that you just can't take it seriously. Maybe that's the point. But it's dealing with some pretty deep issues that shouldn't be satirised.<br/><br/>2/10"

","Baby Doll's (Emily Browning) mother dies leaving her and her little sister in the hands of her abusive stepfather (Gerard Plunkett). The stepfather finds out that the girls are to inherit his late wife's fortune. Determined to get his hands on the money he kills the younger sister and blames Baby Doll. He incarcerates her in the Lennox House for the Mentally Insane run by Dr Gorski (Carla Gugino) and bribes an orderly Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac) to take care of her and make sure she can't tell anyone what he did. She retreats into a fantasy where she and the other patients are hookers trapped in a brothel by Blue Jones who makes them dance for the customers. When Baby Doll dances she goes into a deeper fantasy realm where she finds a Wise Man (Scott Glenn) who helps her to formulate a plan to escape the institution/brothel with the other patients/hookers.<br/><br/>I did not really like this film. Just like Zack Snyder's other films it has a lot of style and is often stunning to look at but the most stunning elements that take place during Baby Doll's dance routines are like watching someone else playing a computer game. There are all sorts of armies of mooks for the women to slaughter including orcs, robots and, best of all, steam-powered German soldier zombies. then there's the boss of the level for Baby Doll to kill. The problem is that the characters themselves did not seem any more real than game characters.<br/><br/>The imaginative style of the film did not make up for the really corny, cliché dialogue. There's a lot of music in the film, mostly cover versions of familiar evergreens. I didn't hate the music but the film was relying on it a lot to create moods where the performances didn't. I'm sure this film will have fans but it just didn't make one out of me.<br/><br/>Rating 5/10"
"rolaris","4","2","6","15 May 2011"," Interesting But Poorly Executed
","Zack Snyder is deemed a master of action-packed slow-paced visual effects, as proved from his previous work on 300 and Watchmen, and a similar visualistic aspect is certainly not lacking in Sucker Punch. He pulls off the stylized graphic novel look with ease and it looks brilliant most of the time. It is, however, unfortunate that the action that shrouds it is too dull and unengaging.<br/><br/>The levels of reality and imagination are maybe a little too distinct to be meaningful and the sequence of events are too ridiculous to be taken seriously. The subject matter is very dark and having two levels of imagination, one built on top of the other, is a bit more unbelievable, and this could have been much more than production team could have probably handled. We can understand what is trying to be conveyed on screen - a constructed fantasy in the mind of a character as she is indecently treated in a mental institution. However, it is poorly executed, especially the conclusion, and we are just left with scene after scene of nonsense and atrocious dialogue.<br/><br/>I give kudos to Snyder for taking a risk on such a project - it meshes some complex storyline with action - but it simply isn't great with either. The girls, which include Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, and Jamie Chung, all give convincing portrayals of their characters, and Oscar Isaac is wonderful as one of the orderlies. The presence of some of the other supporting characters simply deteriorates the realism of the real-life sequences. Since most of the film is presented in a sub-reality or an imagination, anything that happens has less of an impact, leaving one not caring what actually happens to heroines."
"Erlinion","10","2","6","21 April 2011"," A Geek Masterpiece
","This is one of the best movies of the year so far, in my opinion. I've just seen it today, and I have to say, I was blown away. Yes, I've heard about, and actually saw some people who were so disappointed that they walked out on it, but I guess they just didn't understand what this was all about. They probably came in to watch some cool little popcorn flick with nice visuals, and got something else for their money. I'm as fond of decent popcorn flicks as the next guy, I'm not sure Sucker Punch fits the category.<br/><br/>For this is a movie you have to pay attention to, and work it out for yourself. The plot develops on multiple levels, corresponding to different levels of psychological consciousness and/or insanity, and it is choke packed with symbols and archetypes, so much so that it is difficult to say what is the reality (in the terms of the story) behind the imaginary. Though it won't be necessary, it won't hurt either to have some superficial knowledge of psychology and mythic archetypes beforehand - for those who know what I'm talking about, think Hero's Journey.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, there are some very nice visuals, the scenes are breathtaking, but if you're going in unprepared, expecting only a flick with explosions and hot chicks, you will be disappointed, for the scenes won't make any sense to you. Go in with an open and attentive mind, and reap the rewards.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is kind of an art movie for geeks, an amalgamation of colorful action and deep sources of meaning. But all this my opinion, of course; don't take my word on it. Go see the movie if some theatres are still playing it near you, or wait till it comes out on DVD, and make up you own mind. Granted, it's not for everybody, but my guess is if you're into geek stuff, you won't regret this one."

There's a tragic urgency to this story, like telling it directly would be crass and compromise its integrity: no wonder it called for Australian actresses.

","Snyder, the director, continues to amaze me. His big-budget movies, including this one, are and stay highly entertaining. None of them are movies to satisfy deep thinking, but I'm rarely so glad to have spent the money. Dawn of the Dead delivered an updated Zombie experience. 300 did what it promised to do (putting the graphic novel into fitting visual form) and then came Watchmen. The only comic adaption that didn't leave me dissatisfied by ""blockbuster changes"" to the source material. The things that were changed were for the better (ending), the things left out (island of artists, pirate comic) I didn't miss at all in the context of a movie.<br/><br/>Hence I looked forward to his first original work. (Snyder directed and scripted Sucker Punch). The trailer itself pretty much forced me to go and catch this movie, and did it ever deliver.<br/><br/>The movie plays out in different realities. There's the ""real"" world, institutionalizing the main heroine into an insane asylum by her evil (possibly child-molesting) step-dad after the death of her mother. Once there the movie enters a fantasy world, reflecting the real one, but taking place in a burlesque, moulin-rouge with-further-pleasures- sort of establishment. Here Babydoll (the heroine) meets four other girls and wins their aid to escape their imprisonment. To do this they need to find five things. Each of those five missions is presented in a third reality. A reality were giant samurai and orks and dragons are just as real as WW1 Germans and Zeppelins and Mechas and robots. Its sort of Inception but with babes and about 50 different sailor-suits for Babydoll. Its not as confusing as it sounds, and for a movie thats basically a B-movie affair, the story is pretty good. Especially the ending, making a nice tie to the beginning, comes as a surprise, but makes sense in a very satisfying way.<br/><br/>The director obviously played a lot of video-games and saw a lot of anime. There are visual references all over the place.<br/><br/>And this is the biggest flaw I see in this movie. There's too much of it. Its like KillBill on steroids. There's so much going on, so many different sceneries to explore, that I found myself actually tired after two thirds of the running-time. (And I didn't even tire with the Matrix sequels) A second, more relaxed view might be needed to appreciate the sheer mass of visuals that went into this. It is, as many have written before a video game that you don't play, but watch and it is a pleasure to do so.<br/><br/>In the end, this world wouldn't be a worse place without Sucker Punch, but its something that wasn't there before, and demands to be seen by anyone interested in a ride thats nowhere near to anything seen before."
"jmaxstadt","8","2","6","7 April 2011"," What's really real in Sucker Punch?
","A lot of the conventional wisdom on Sucker Punch is that it's entertaining and loaded with eye-candy, but that it lacks a coherent story or character development and may even pander to the sexual exploitation that it appears to decry. I'd say the reviewers who came to those conclusions missed a pretty good movie.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is like Fight Club - the whole movie is in the last few minutes. Also like Fight Club, it's an open question how much of the action is real and even how many of the characters and settings are real (in the context of the movie). We can begin by assuming that the video game sequences in which the girls fight giants and zombies and demons and robots are fantasy sequences, real only in the sense that fantasy is a real part of the life of the mind (and this is one of the themes of the movie that's easy to miss).<br/><br/>Conversely, we can assume that the bus and bus stop at the end of the movie are real in the context of the movie, that Sweet Pea really gets on a real bus (although maybe not, and without that assumption the movie is a vastly darker one). Is the asylum real? The staff and the lobotomy doctor are dressed in the style of the Sixties, but the bus stop was modern day.<br/><br/>Is the nightclub real? Most of the asylum characters are entirely different people in the nightclub, excepting the kitchen and the cook which are the same in both. But the ""unreal"" nightclub is where some of the girls are killed. So were they really killed? Or were they really real (in the context of the movie) to begin with? Consider how we meet Sweet Pea, in a role-playing session on a stage set pretty much identically to the first view we saw of Baby Doll's room at home. Sweet Pea then stops the lobotomy scene (which is also shifted to a theatrical scene on the ""stage,"" this time in the club) to complain about the incoherence and lack of commercial possibilities in the story (i.e. Baby Doll's story).<br/><br/>Is Baby Doll herself really real, or is she a manifestation of a part of Sweet Pea's consciousness? Note how Baby Doll is dressed in the scene outside the asylum when she sacrifices herself so that Sweet Pea can escape. Also, remember the narration at the beginning, about how we find our guardian angels and how they find us.<br/><br/>This is a very complicated and interesting movie about consciousness and existentialism and the life of the mind, masquerading as a girl-power action flick. On that level, obviously, it's going to raise more questions than it answers, but it's far from cheap flash and exploitation. Don't sell it short."

","Now when I saw the trailer for the movie, I immediately thought, ""Now this is odd. Robots, dragons, and mechas occupying the same space as a hot catholic schoolgirl with a samurai sword and a pair of pistols? I might go see it"" When I saw that Zack Snyder had the reins for this flick, I decided to go see it just because I watched all of his previous movies(Watchmen kicked ass and the Dawn of The Dead remake made zombies actually scary) and I wanted to know how this'll hold up to the rest of the. When I went to see it, my presumptions were partially not unfounded, the rest, well read the title of the review. This movie was actually a fairly smart, if odd movie. But enough of my rambling, onto the review.<br/><br/>The plot centers around a young woman named Baby Doll, a young woman who's sent to a corrupt insane asylum because of her rapist of a stepfather after her mother passed away. There she has meets the other girls and plans an escape with them. In 7 days she faces a lobotomy and that's the countdown for the movie. From there it starts getting weird.<br/><br/>In the movie there are three forms of reality, the one where she's in an insane asylum and everything's dark and dreary. The second is a dream world where it's in 20s burlesque house where the girls go to cope with the horror of the asylum. Finally the third one is a dream within a dream where they're a bunch of ass-kicking commandos. The second reality is where most of the movie takes place in and the third reality is when she's dancing. Before you get in a huff on how the dreams make the movie schizophrenic, but that's the whole point. Dream logic only makes sense to the one having the dream. From the perspective of Baby Doll, men except for the old guy are the villains while the women are the one's kicking ass and looking good at the same time.<br/><br/>In my personal opinion, I liked the movie, it's both somewhat intellectually engaging, while still being a great, if somewhat overblown(you used the slow-mo tool a wee bit too much there Zachy boy) action flick.

It's certainly a surrealist take on a sad and horrible subject matter.<br/><br/>The dream journeys are disjointed and don't feel connected, but who has dream sequences that all follow a single visual/conceptual pattern? I think the sound track and the costuming was sensational, but it's a hodge podge of genres and feels. There is certainly enough action and boobs for most guys to get on board, and I won't deny that I have an obsessive need for t-straps, corsets, an olive-drab nurses hat, and sparkly tights now.<br/><br/>The story sequence may confuse some, as it occasionally skips back and forth in time, giving you the ending before you've taken the journey. The majority of the film is a hallucination that mimics actual events in an alternate location that you rarely see. If you pay close attention to the costuming you will see where they flip flop between the actual reality, the brothel reality, and the girl power fantasy land.<br/><br/>It takes you on a crazy, trippy, Dali-esque journey, but at the end I did not enjoy the destination even though I did enjoy the ride."

","""Sucker Punch"" is gorgeous. And I'm not just talking about its quintet of leading ladies, who are all undeniably attractive. Every shot of the movie is absolutely drool-worthy.<br/><br/>It's no ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Casablanca."" But who expects it to be? Anyone familiar with director Zack Snyder's previous films (the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""300"", ""Watchmen"") or anyone who's seen a trailer of the movie, should know exactly what to expect.<br/><br/>It's hard to describe the plot because there's plenty open to interpretation. The movie follows a girl, played by Emily Browning, known to the audience mostly as ""Babydoll."" Locked away in an insane asylum, she and/or the other girl(s) cope with reality by retreating into one or more levels of fantasy. Now's not the place to get into my interpretation of the plot. Suffice it to say the ""story"", while being a little bit deeper than what you'd expect from your typical action flick, is still just a line to hang jaw-dropping action scenes on. <br/><br/>As Snyder's first completely original screenplay, ""Sucker Punch"" is exactly what you would expect from the imagination of the man who directed ""Watchmen"". Almost every male fantasy conceivable is brought to life on screen, from the beautiful women (obviously), to samurai swords, epic fantasy and science fiction landscapes, heavy artillery, evil robots, and more. Snyder doesn't exactly have a flare for dialog, and some of the lines feel clunky. So, thankfully, not much talking is done. The dramatic opening sequence, after a little bit of narration, is silent except for a cinematic cover of ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"", telling the audience everything they need to know through action and the actor's expressions. Similarly, not much talking gets done during the movie's big action set pieces, definitely the highlights of the film.<br/><br/>As with Snyder's other films, it's easy to compare the way certain scenes are shot to a video game or a music video. The soundtrack is perfect, incorporating covers of classic and modern rock songs perfect for each scene they accompany, including some performed by Emily Browning herself in an enchanting, haunting voice. Even the incidental music adds to the movie's excitement. <br/><br/>Being a movie with five major characters that's less than two hours long, not all of the characters feel fully developed. Jena Malone as ""Rocket"" delivers the best acting performance, sharing most of the movie's dramatic scenes with Abbie Cornish as ""Sweet Pea."" Vanessa Hudgens as ""Blondie"" actually does surprisingly well during the action scenes, but her voice still seems too sweet for this kind of role, and she's not going to help audience forget she's a graduate of ""High School Musical"" anytime soon. Emily Browning does a fine job with the leading role, conveying more through her big eyes and pouty lips than any of her lines. Jamie Chung as ""Amber"", personally my favorite character, sadly gets very little screen time. As far as supporting performances go, Carla Gugino delivers yet another solid acting job, Jon Hamm adds a touch of class, and Scott Glenn intrigues as the mysterious, homespun wisdom spurning ""Wiseman."" Oscar Isaac is noteworthy as a nasty who doesn't seem like a typical Hollywood villain but an all-too-real sleaze ball audiences should love to loathe.<br/><br/>But for the most part, dialog and story aren't Zack Snyder's strong suits. The CGI is breathtaking, the action choreography's plenty of fun, the girls all look great, and the cinematography is a feast for the eyes. And not just during action scenes. Each time the camera panned around the murky corners of the asylum, I found myself turning my head to try to see what was coming. ""Sucker Punch"" may not be for everyone, but it delivers everything the marketing promises. It's a visual feast with a script that, while not sensational, manages to be just good enough to stay out of the way."

","So i recently went to see los angeles :battlefield , and while we were climbing up the escalator we saw this huge poster of Sucker Punch . Well while the poster looked kick ass we wondered how this was going to be . I mean it has chicks , guns/knifes and robots .What more could you ask for right ? :D <br/><br/>Well today i went for the movie and i got exactly what i asked for . Some people will compare it to the recent movies but i must say this movie can hold its ground of its own . The dialogues/quotes are awesome . I can even remember them now . The movie is like sailormoon with guns haha. If you fall in the age group of 15-30 and are into games /anime im sure you will like this one . people above that age might probably find it a bore . Remember this is a fantasy/role play movie so i suggest you keep your brain at home , and watch the movie for the mindless slashing and dicing of enemies . Also keep on the look out for the beauitful colours/visuals . This is the same director (zack snyder) who has given us hits like 300 and watchmen . And he doesn't fail to let go of his imagination and bring us another hit.<br/><br/>Also im sure you are going to enjoy the soundtrack which captivated me from the beginning to end . <br/><br/>7.5/10<br/><br/>Regards Kenrickf India"

","This movie is the true definition of messing with your mind. But for now let me start off by saying this film had the most amazing graphics and CGI i have ever seen the action scenes in this film were so real the way it was made i felt i was in the movie myself. However the music also made the action awesome not a big fan of rock but for this movie it changed my view of it and i liked it more.<br/><br/>The story itself is very simple, similar films have been done before but with a different style. The story was amazing and sad but very entertaining i absolutely enjoyed the story and very impressed with the acting i loved all the actors/actresses in this film they truly made it worth it.<br/><br/>The movie was good right into about the ending where things mostly start to become complicated and very confusing. I can say in the ending Sweet Pea survives and makes it home but the main confusing thing is did the film give all the details for the ending, the answer is NO The ending was almost good then it felt like Snyder was the only person who understood the ending (don't listen to IMDb members they are all theories of how they feel the ending meant) The ending is really a Sucker Punch in the face the ending was so bad it makes the movie bad and make it a complete rip-off and just makes the whole plot more stupid.<br/><br/>As i said i enjoyed the film it was very entertaining but i just felt that the film needed more and it failed to show what it could do. Snyder should have done his thing with this movie i think the 'Director's Cut' of this film will be better and may show more details.<br/><br/>Overall i must say i enjoyed it but at the same time i left with a 'WTF' and i am pretty sure the majority of people who see this would leave with the same thought. But the movie was so perfect it fails bu going backwards by not knowing how to end it.<br/><br/>Also one more thing i understand why people may give this film a low-rating its because it is very complicated it ended similar to the film 'Shutter Island' where you don't know if it was a dream, reality or what, which is why i give it a 6/10.<br/><br/>This film was missing something.........A Ending"
"billie_wongt4","6","2","6","27 March 2011"," This sucker feels punched
","You will be unprepared..... for this boring ride. I'm sorry to say it, but Zack Synder really dropped the ball on this one. I'm (well, I USED to be) a rabid fan of Snyder since Dawn of the Dead. I knew he was special because that movie just blew me away and really reinvented the genre for me (like 28 days later also did). It was something different and unexpected. I love it when a movie exceeds your expectations, which is so rare in this day and age with Hollywood (I generally go with the International scene if I want my mind blown nowadays - Japanese oldies like Crow 0. some good ol' Korean flicks and Euro horror generally satisfy now). Anyway, so I basically own every Zack Snyder movie on DVD AND Bluray since that point (except for Owls....but I seem to sense a trend ... and it ain't a good one...).<br/><br/>Suckerpunch fails on several levels - mostly on writing and acting. I love the worlds that he created - they're pretty lush, though the CG world of the dragon looked a little too fake in some fly-by scenes. What failed was the story that held it all together. There was no glue between each of the separate fight sequences. What you see in the trailer is what you get. Literally. Basically ""You need these 5 items... now go forth"" - ""Wow! That's great. I will collect them and ask no questions and not have a plan. Yay!"" *Clap hands excitedly like a little school girl*. All resistance is also quelled with the declaration that the plan only requires these items. Um.... really? You're not even going to try, Zack? If he had even tried to string it all together, I would have gone with it. One really cool idea, though, was the usage of steam to emulate blood. What a great PG-13 tool - though it was brilliant on its own merit without trying to mask blood.<br/><br/>I love the different worlds he created, but the world she created in her mind (the Dance world) was incredibly boring. B-O-R-I-N-G. That's because it relies on Synder's ability to tell a story, write dialogue and the girls' acting abilities. Cornish and Malone were the only competent girls, though Cornish's accent kept fading in and out. Cornish was tough and beautiful and I loved her knight costume with the hood. Babydoll has the most incredible look, but that's all she had going for her. She is stunning with zero substance. She relies on her looks and her eyes more than anything else, and just stands there most of the time. None of the girls were seductive. I don't know if this was a case of PG-13 affecting the movie, but there was this pseudo lesbian scene that I'm assuming Zack wanted to make hot, but it fell completely flat. Competent actors could have made it work - Hudgens.... let's just say I've never seen High School musical that made her famous - and I'll bet Sucker punch won't be her ticket to the big leagues either. Chung is cute and really doesn't do much else except be cute. She has the acting prowess of those import car models, without the sultry sexiness. <br/><br/>I don't know if it's because I walked in there with such high expectations - I was waiting excitedly since it was announced - but I was hugely disappointed. The movie is one big trailer, and though that's not a bad thing sometimes, it is in this case because I thought maybe he'd insert a story somewhere. My bad. The dialogue was really weak as well and the girls weren't competent enough to save it. And the most nauseating scene is the lighter scene in the change room. When you see it, you'll know what I mean. It defies classification - it's something a high school project would have come up with. The intro - it was a high point. If the movie just stuck with that pacing (love the Soundtrack by the way), it would have been another groundbreaking Snyder film, like 300, Dawn, and Watchmen... but it could have just been because there was no dialogue and it relied on Zack's forte... stunning visuals. And then they spoke....<br/><br/>Zack: I'm disappointed with you man. I love you. I did love you. I just might have to retire you next to my old fallen hero, James Cameron who failed me with Titanic and followed it up with some more boring Blue crap.<br/><br/>My personal score for this movie would be much worse, but I'm rating it according to IMDb scores, and they tend to be more generous than I am. If you're a Snyder fan, you'll be unprepared.. for this crapfest. This movie isn't going to make anyone rich. I really hope Snyder gets to still do Superman after this... his star might have fallen really hard after this opening weekend. Maybe Nolan can save him (though... I have my doubts with his writing after seeing the over-hyped Inception... good movie... but not that good, nor creative.)"

","This exciting and surprisingly dark and serious fusion genre contains sparkling and engaging elements of several popular movies. There is the set stark retro design and plot flavor of Sin City (2005), the elegant sadistic gender dominance of Point of No Return (1993), the fantasy images of Big Trouble In Little China (1986), the female warrior of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001), the dazzling effects of Inception (2010), and the moral taste of Cube Zero (2004). This is a feminine version of Brazil (1985) that captures the humanity and empathy of their female existence along with the imaginative interactive bonding of superheroes against a male crafted universe. The movie is both melancholy and hopeful at the same time but with several gyrating twists. Sucker Punch deserves its own place in filmy history for its female vision and self-empowerment and yet there is also an undercurrent of sacrifice and a sorority of sisters of sorts."

","If you want to test out your Blu-ray player, HDTV or surround sound system, then Sucker Punch is the movie for you.

Zack Snyder has a talent for directing action, but he should stick to adapting other people's stories."
"pjvanes69","8","1","2","9 October 2012"," More than just chicks with guns kicking butt.
","At it's most basic level Sucker Punch is a great fun popcorn flick, more like an extended trailer for an action video game than a movie. Visually stimulating though somewhat exhausting at times, it's a mash up of various genres and styles and is certainly not for everyone but delve a little further and there's a lot more going on than chicks with guns kicking butt. Buried way below the spectacle is a much deeper story which has been explored in an unusual but very effective way, if only it wasn't so open for misinterpretation. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the main themes of the story are overshadowed by heavy handed style and over-the-top action pieces that will distract all but the most willing to see past the pop culture facade, which is a pity because it's a much more thought provoking and well constructed film than it has been given credit for. Snyder's 'rock video' approach kind of trivializes the subject matter of mind and spirit triumphing over circumstance pushing it back to the point of obscurity.<br/><br/>It would be fascinating to give the bare bones of this script to a director like David Fincher, who has had a lot more success at delving into the dark side of human psyche and serving it up to audiences in a palatable way from rock videos such as Aerosmith's Janies Got a Gun to films like The Fight Club and Zodiac and see what results.<br/><br/>Although the action / fantasy sequences were executed amazingly well and are great fun to watch, I found they did drag on a bit longer than necessary (how many robot Nazis do we really need to see being decapitated?) and they assaulted the senses so much that it was difficult to get back into 'plot mode' after each one but despite this I personally really enjoyed Sucker Punch.<br/><br/>Snyder is certainly carving out his own niche in film history and I'm enjoying the ride so far and am certainly looking forward to his take on Superman."
"Mcsteber","5","1","2","17 July 2012"," Neither love nor hate

Where I don't feel cheated in any way by watching it, I have no interest in seeing it again. If you like watching sexy women in an action film then go for it.

"Locoyokopoco","10","1","2","5 February 2012"," A Trip!
","Sucker Punch is an intense journey in which you already know what's in- store for you at the end. It provides you with all the tools you need to begin your trip. Your imagination is the only obstacle in the path that sets you toward the inevitable finale. Bliss becomes the art that transpires the woeful reality. Regrets give you the strength to fight. Fight, for a greater purpose. But all good things must come to an end, and as end draws near, you let go of the regrets. The regrets that flow alongside you, until you let go, for something only bigger than yourself. All bad beginnings must have good ending. To have arrived at the end, where it all began.<br/><br/>Snyder has really outdone himself on this one.<br/><br/>PS: Pay close attention to the beginning of the film where Baby Doll first enters the asylum. You'll notice that she passes by ""The Boss"" with the lighter (fire), then Blue's office with the map, then the kitchen with the knife, followed by Blue with the key on his neck, and finally Baby Doll herself. Very clever way of foreshadowing."
"davideo-2","7","1","2","12 January 2012"," Stylish, entertaining graphic novel adaptation
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>A young girl (Emily Browning) who comes to be known as Babydoll, finds herself institutionalised in a mental asylum by her wicked step father, which is a front for a gentlemen's club, run by the slimy Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), where girls are forced to perform erotic dances for the amusement of rich men. After being put on the spot to perform her first dance, Babydoll finds herself transported to a mystical fantasy world, where she finds herself under the tutelage of the Wise Man (Scott Glenn) who teaches her to place her mind where her body isn't. From here, Babydoll hatches a plot to break herself and her fellow dancers free.<br/><br/>The graphic novel adaptation craze, started by Robert Rodriguez with 2005's Sin City, is still alive and kicking, as evidenced by Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch, which from the opening already appears slightly lost in a case of style over substance, with the blurry, grungy cinematography and deep, heavy goth soundtrack not promising much in the way of an engaging story. But stick with it past this little hurdle and there's a more enjoyable, traditional action thriller to wit here of a group of heroes, here quite pleasantly in the shape of some sexy girls in kinky outfits, taking down a dastardly villain. It's gained some criticism for it's content being a 12 certificate film, and it is easy to see why this is, given the girl's dress sense and some of the quite explicit violence in parts.<br/><br/>It's a bad omen, but probably the most impressive thing about the film is the special effects, stylish, impressive CGI action set pieces, including dragons, fighter aircraft and Nazi trenches, brought to life with a colourful, vibrant quality that makes the film work where it was meant to. Snyder has worked his Watchmen formula to a film not quite as violent or graphic, but which still packs quite a powerful punch, with a plot in reverse twist at the end that helps it make sense a bit more.<br/><br/>Unlike Watchmen, it's wisely a lot shorter and therefore more palatable and works a bit more where that film didn't. The characters are certainly more pleasing to the eye, and to be honest so is the action, so even if it isn't perfect, you're on to a far surer bet with it. ***"
"hastings-pebble","9","1","2","15 October 2011"," Originality amongst so many other 'also ran' films
","The overall effect of the film was one of a deep feeling of being satisfied, knowing that it was time and money well spent. There are so many scenes where you're left half-guessing as to the outcome and yet the result is almost never quite as you'd expect. There are numerous scenarios that you feel are just ridiculous, but whereas in a poor film, these situations serve as extra nails in the coffin, Sucker Punch rides above them. Despite unanswered questions and pausing to think about the credibility of the storyline's details, I was continually pulled further down, being increasingly immersed into the plight of the girls. For sheer entertainment there are several scenes that take you beyond the film into the realm of other films (the Matrix kept popping up in my mind). The story is compelling and the acting fairly solid. The soundtrack acted as glue between the scenes and added a feel of overall continuity. By the end of the film the music has taken on delivering as much engagement as the story itself. This is no ordinary film and therefore I should imagine the 'ordinary' (meant in a non-disparaging manner, perhaps 'mainstream' would be a better word) viewer won't be as enthralled as those who appreciate 'out of the box' thinking."

","I guess here in my country it was one of the most promoted flicks and the one no-one went to. Really, even at my work there were posters hanging in the men's toilets. And admit, most posters just shown the girls in sexy underwear or clothes. So indeed, I thought that this was one for the flesh flute players. But still, all the negativity surrounding this flick kept me attracted to it. How many times are flicks being hated by the press becoming cult classics. Now I don't think that it will be a classic, only time will tell. Al the 5 girls were almost unknown for me, okay, I knew Vanessa Hudgens from High School Shitcall and Jena Malone from The Ruins but that was all. Scott Glenn didn't need an introduction I guess. But back to the five, I was surprised that they did it all well. Naturally it's a Zack Ryder flick and you love him or hate him. He's really a CGI man. And it do shows but it's all done so beautiful that I never was annoyed by the CGI. And the score, what a great tracks and how it was edited into the flick. I have seen the extended cut which clocks in 17 minutes longer so it took me over 2 hours of my life and wasn't bored at all. The CGI did take the overhand at the dream (or should I say dance) sequences but there was actually a story involved. This may be Zack's most controversial feature so far but if you can dig futuristic flicks or fantasy than it's one to watch. It do contain dragons, zombies, robots and creatures to have a fight with. For me it was a nice surprise to have seen Sucker Punch, I liked it, strangely most of the viewers didn't."

","For starters it was definitely something unique, faltering in those small places which could have possibly made this movie one to remember. Pretty girls battling in high heels is probably not the best way to make a lasting impression with viewers and the fact being they have all done a very good job made it easier for me to like sucker punch. The fighting scenes in the movie could have been better (shorter), not the effects but the whole approach seemed kind of monotonous. And also taking the high roller scene off the reel has probably caused a lot of damage to the movie. Emily Browning(the best reason at first i watched this movie for) more than qualifies for the role of baby doll. Sucker punch is not a movie where every single thing is explained, it leaves the audience to figure most of it out. Looking for an action movie with a brain??- its right here."

It is not an epic fantasy like ""Lord of the Rings"" but it's more like ""Pan's Labyrinth"" where boundary between reality and fantasy overlaps. Many people are claiming it to be a senseless movie because of its unrealistic fight scenes and uncleared story but according to me that is the best thing about this movie. The plot, graphics, and story were awesome, Fight scenes were not up to the mark with ""300"" and ""watchmen"" but they were also good. <br/><br/>To sum it all: Don't watch this movie if you are not a fan of dark fantasy genre."

However, if you are say the type of person who is easily confused by traffic lights then you will not enjoy this film. The plot of the film makes perfect sense if you can follow it and it saddens me that so many people have slated a good film because they are mentally incapable of doing so.

"tedw-dyer","7","1","2","28 August 2011"," Sucker Punch Delivers Unexpected Depth
","It is easy to dismiss Sucker Punch as another of the mounting number of films where digital effects substitute for plot, character development, script and justification. I think this seduced many reviewers into panning this effort based on preconceived notions. That's a shame, because this movie accomplishes much that makes it a fine bit of film-making.<br/><br/>First, we care about the characters as they progress from societal jetsam into living engaging, satisfying entities through the most unconventional mechanism of sheer fantasy. Second, the film leaves us with several strong messages and pays homage to heroic altruism in a way that was, for this reviewer, quite shattering. After the banality of other fantasies such as Thor and Green Lantern, this level of engagement was very welcome indeed.<br/><br/>Of course, one must address the issue of eye candy. The movie is a fountainhead of imagination. It aspires to portrayal of intense violence with almost no blood, sexuality with no nudity and makes use of the female warrior archetype with a completeness that films like Aeon Flux and Ultraviolet seemed to miss in the final analysis. Most gratefully, this success was achieved without the cloying presence of 3D.<br/><br/>Seven out of ten seems like a high rating, but unconventional courage must be respected and this film provides it in both conception and execution."
"overthoughtideas","Null","1","2","22 August 2011"," Great special effects movie, but if you're looking for a plot.... you might want to look elsewhere.
","So I just got done watching the theatrical version and I have to say that I'm kind of at a loss for words. The movie isn't horrible, but it's also nowhere near spectacular. Sucker Punch is definitely a ""meh"" movie. The special effects, fight choreography, and props are spectacularly well done. You can definitely see the influence of ""300"" on the cinematography as well. The problem... is the plot... and the acting... and practically everything else.<br/><br/>The first 10-15 minutes do a bang up job of introducing the main character, Babydoll, and the story leading up to her being put into a mental institution by her stepfather after her mother's death. After that, the story and actors just go through the motions of a typical brainless popcorn movie with bad dialog. There's some great action scenes, plenty of 'splosions, and a fairly hefty nod to the steampunk, dieselpunk, and (sort of) cyberpunk subcultures. Dead German soldiers reanimated with steam power and gears, zeppelins, a giant stone samurai with a mini-gun, robots, and even dragons and goblins (huh?) are among the ""bad guys"" featured in the movie. Plus, what's not to like about a blonde in pigtails and a Japanese school girl outfit shooting guns and swinging a wickedly engraved katana around. Yet, despite it all, by the end of the movie there are so many loose ends to the story line and paper bags left abandoned by actors that couldn't act their way out of them, that a herd of kittens could be kept amused for weeks.<br/><br/>Supposedly the extended version that came out on Bluray is supposed to explain things a little differently (possibly better). However, I doubt that adding 15 minutes of footage could save this movie from being any more than the below average mindless popcorn movie that it is. If you're willing to leave your brain at the door, by all means watch it, but if you're looking for a thought-provoking film, you might almost be better served watching the Smurfs movie."
"dazworthy","Null","1","2","16 August 2011"," Great imagery, entertaining but dark
","Those familiar with director Zack Snyder's work (The 300, Watchmen) will have some idea of what to expect from Sucker Punch. But it's certainly a film that I found full of surprises as well. Snyder creates a hyper-reality full of stunning imagery, spectacular action, and compelling characters. Baby-Doll (Emily Browning) is a girl institutionalized by her brutal stepfather after the death of her mother. Once inside the asylum she quickly retreats into a fantasy world. Within this realm she develops a plan to escape, along with new friends played by Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung. The plans involves several quests within this fantasy world to collect the tools necessary for their escape – and spectacular (and violent) action sequences ensue. Sucker Punch has been panned by many critics but I think some of the criticism is a little unfair. The opening is quite brilliant, almost like a highly artistic music video, and at that point I thought I was really in for something special. However once the movie settles into the ""quest"" sequences it becomes a little repetitive (it's been compared to the levels of a video game), but I think the imagery and action dished up certainly makes up for it. I also found the finale compelling and unpredictable. I think the film will be a hit with young adults – it's a very cool film with an excellent soundtrack that will appeal as well. The performances of the five girls are all good, (although in my opinion Jena Malone is a standout), and the smaller roles are also solid. It's also quite a dark film, more so than I expected. Whilst the action is spectacular the overall tone is quite bleak, and I think this actually gives the film more substance. Whilst a normal action is film is quickly forgotten, Sucker Punch leaves you with a few emotive moments and striking images that linger with you after you've left the cinema."

","When i saw the previews for this movie, i thought that it might not be worth spending money, or time, for; i was WAY wrong. Zack Snyder has finally come out with an original film from his own mind about a girl, Babydoll, who is placed in a mental asylum by her wicked stepfather to be lobotomized, but the doctor won't be there until five days later. So, in order to keep herself sane and to forget about the 'torture' done to her by the orderlies, Babydoll befriends four other girls who help her try to escape from the asylum before the High Roller (doctor) gets there.<br/><br/>People are probably hating this movie because they don't understand the transition from asylum to dance studio to epic combat sequences. The dance studio that Babydoll pictures herself in is the asylum, just in a much nicer manner, and when she dances, she's actually being ""confronted"" by Blue (Oscar Isaac) in the real world/asylum. The combat sequences that are shown to the audience when she supposedly dances is her internal conflict to stay alive and to fight the horrors that Blue acts upon her. The movie overall is a true spectacle, with incredible visuals, wonderful acting, and a compelling story that grips you to your seat as you wait to find out what happens after each fantasy sequence. This is a great movie, and people should have an open mind when watching it, or look at all the details and figure out the story through the characters. Either way, this movie will always be a favorite for me. <br/><br/>8/10 Stars"

(The only things missing were the building and the ape) (trust me on that, it'll make sense)<br/><br/>For the first time in a long time, I've found a movie I might be willing to buy, not rent."

","OK I hate stuffy self absorbed reviews. With that in mind I'll keep it brief. I watched this on a foggy early Sunday AM and it was perfect for a time filler. Great visual effects, campy corny acting that manages to please and not bore. I love movies like this in that they don't take themselves nearly as serious as most of the reviews.<br/><br/>If I were to be critical of it I didn't like is the story seemed to be missing something. And the end left me thinking what just happened? It is a movie that will leave me wondering what happened in the end and I'll try to fill in the blanks myself and it will fail. But for a fun movie that is just cool to watch this totally fits the bill. I saw it via Zune and I bet it will do really well there.<br/><br/>I think people who over think this movie or who want to shovel it neatly in to some demographic are the type of people that don't enjoy movies the way most people do they try too hard over think it and end up missing the point."

","Many will write off this movie as too strange with form over substance, a great visual display that means nothing. It isn't as simple as that. I enjoyed it, for the something different that it is.<br/><br/>As the movie begins we see a will, where a now dead mother gave her two daughters to her husband, their stepfather. A mean stepfather. While the older daughter is trying to protect them, she accidentally shoots her younger sister. This puts her into a hospital for the insane. But she isn't insane. <br/><br/>The hospital is not your usual hospital, instead it is run to train the attractive girls to dance and entertain clients, to give them pleasure.<br/><br/>Emily Browning is the stepdaughter, and in the hospital she is called Baby Doll. When she is asked to dance, the only way she can do it is to retreat into a fantasy world, one where she can fight and slay any assortment of robots, monsters, or fire-breathing dragons. <br/><br/>Although we never see what is actually going on during these escapes into fantasy, it apparently results in her dancing performances unlike any they have seen before. She soon is a big hit. But Baby Doll wants to escape the hospital, and during her fantasy Scott Glenn as the Wise Man tells her what she needs to get ... a map, fire, a knife, and a key. Plus one other that she will discover for herself.<br/><br/>Her cohorts, both in the fantasy scenes and for the escape attempt are Abbie Cornish as Sweet Pea, Jena Malone as Rocket, Vanessa Hudgens as Blondie, and Jamie Chung as Amber .<br/><br/>The lady who takes these showgirls under her wing is Carla Gugino as Dr. Vera Gorski. While Oscar Isaac is Blue Jones, the ruthless operator of the whole thing. <br/><br/>SPOILERS: Both Rocket and Blondie die at the hands of Blue Jones, but Baby Doll and Sweet Pea make it outside the building. Still, they must get by a group of men. Baby Doll discovers what the last item was, it was for her to sacrifice herself to allow Sweet Pea to make it out, and eventually travel to a better life. Outside, she gets on a bus, the driver is The Wise Man. Reality and fantasy fusing into one."

","uh. well. i always say this, but how weird. i kinda liked it though. it definitely had intriguing production design and was a little more off the wall than the usual CGI SYFY gibberish. not that a lot of this didn't seem like demented gibberish, but strangely, i kind of got it and understood it. it felt a lot like female empowerment gear, but it had enough message about the inner self versus outside influence to even empower men with a certain amount of individualism. but mostly it was a chick action flick for teen age girlies.<br/><br/>not that chick action films are bad. i actually sort of liked 'Barbed Wire' with Pam Anderson. definitely this film had elements similar to ""Barbed Wire' or something like 'Barbarella' or a Russ Meyer flick. but this film was a little bit more overblown and aimed at a much younger audience. i mean 'HSM' queen star Vanessa Hudgens was in this. need i say more? basically for babies.<br/><br/>i thought it was kind of cool. had a cool enough soundtrack that's for sure. it had a real Stan Lee element to it. it also had the feel of a live action Japanese anime toon or something like that.<br/><br/>young girls will probably like this and they probably should because it's probably pretty good for them. girls should be tough and independent but still maintain their femininity. nothing wrong with that and this movie was hardly exploitive sexually since there was no nudity and the stripper clothing wasn't really all that suggestive.<br/><br/>there wasn't really a lot of gory violence either. lots of violence. just not gory violence. the only thing i really objected to was the violence against dragons. the girl kills a baby dragon and it's mother. i love dragons and people should know that dragons are cool and are our friends. killing dragons is so brutal and really uncool. especially baby dragons that never even tried to hurt these chicks. i thought the mommy dragon had a right to be peeved because they killed her baby. uncool.<br/><br/>the rest of the movie was pretty cool though. more power to women throughout the world. but i don't condone dragon killing or cruelty against dragons. that was uncool."

","Whilst i can see that the visual effects are stunning, and the movie captured and brought home the concepts it wished to portray, the movie itself, i found sickening and degrading towards women in ways i did not expect and i wanted to fast forward through some scenes. This movie is all about the pre-era dominance of prehistoric men in a world that they believe only they understand and the movie captured the concept of the young women truly being in a powerless situation that they are unable to control thus concocting a fantasy world as a form of escapism. The film used attractive, vulnerable looking young woman as a tool for these purposes, beating them down and destroying their sense of hope and will throughout. This movie made me very angry but fulfilled the purposes with which it set out to achieve so 6/10 from me even though i wished to give it lower."

","The IMDb average rating for this film is fair (6.3 at the moment) It does dazzle the eyes at times, impressive CGI, but too much of it, it's not necessary to tell a good story and this is what is hindering cinema at the moment. In 1992 when it was new, T2 was cutting edge, but now CGI is everywhere, I prefer the puppet Yoda not the CGI one, too much CGI for me, got bored with it to tell you the truth.<br/><br/>However interlaced within the unnecessary CGI is a bit of dialogue and story, and this is a decent premise, it tells it's story similar to Inception almost, except instead of a dream the 'fantasy world' is a metaphoric world. It started well and ended well, very well in fact, this was when the film was set in 'reality' if only they had interspersed more 'reality' moments this film could have been a lot better, they could have lost one of the CGI segments and peppered in more 'reality' moments that were happening in conjunction with the 'fantasy' moments, this could have made the film 9 or 10, as it had that potential.<br/><br/>I do believe though that this film was marketed for a certain demo-graph, and so it probably does them well, but we, the people like films that are universal, and so although a good film all things considered, I will definitely watch again! Let it be known though I am a bit of a Grinch when it comes to CGI (that is CRAP GRAPPLING INCOME) I even found Iron Man 2 boring because of it, they can by all means use it but there has to be a limit, especially if the crap grappling income is used at the expense of character development and what could have been decent dialogue.

And our girl named baby doll(Who thought about those names?) as soon as she gets there decides to break out. Yeah - sounds cool right? So the plot is alright I guess, could of been better but the plot isn't the most important here. Acting is pretty bad. In entire movie there is only two characters that I liked.

"hussein-hakem","6","1","2","2 July 2011"," If you are looking for action, fantasy worlds & beautiful girls
","First of all, let us have a quick review about the director Zack Snyder, Zack is the director for both hits ""300"" & ""Watchmen"", regardless both story lines, the direction was a remarkable trademark for Snyder's slow motion action & camera angles. This is what is happening here in Sucker Punch, the movies contains beautiful girls with big guns & acrobatic abilities to deliver memorable action packed sequences in a number of fantasy world created from the main character's ""Baby Doll"" imagination. but thats that... The story you'll either OK with it (not love it) or totally hate it. as it seems that Snyder (also screen writer) created the action & fantasy sequences & still haven't finished the main plot idea to back up the sequences. overall, if your are looking for girls with big guns, that's the movie.either than that just avoid I personally enjoyed the movie as I knew what I was getting into."
"travisk-11-189335","6","1","2","27 March 2011"," More than a popcorn flick, but far from perfect...
","For the most part, I enjoyed SUCKER PUNCH. Visually, the film is amazing, as Snyder's films always are, but I feel he's getting a little too comfortable with using his ""trademark"" slow-motion/bullet-time effects in EVERYTHING he does. I really would like to see him do something without that as a creative crutch. It worked well in 300 since it was primarily an action film, and WATCHMEN was long enough that these effects were merely occasional artistic flairs, and made sense. In SUCKER PUNCH, there's too much of this and it stands out, primarily due to the back-and-forth nature of this film's narrative structure, jumping in and out, from reality to fantasy, whereas these effects only appear in the fantasy segments. Otherwise, I liked the story (a positive message told through a very down beat story) and the film also benefits from a good, throwback, high energy, edgy pop soundtrack. The narrated bit at the end, however, was a tad heavy-handed."

I didn't expect a complex or even great story but in terms of action its delivers, you wont be disappointed. The action is there, cinematography is great, the CGI is amazing. All the dream sequences are action packed and very rewarding, my favorite fight was the first encounter with the giant samurais. Emily browning is really, really hot as well as the other girls and they make a good job with the ""ok"" script they were given to work with.<br/><br/>And now the bad things,The big reason the movie is flawed is The story I felt I was watching a bad version of Brazil and Inception I never felt the danger or some kind of tension when the girls are fighting, maybe its not the idea. The characters needed more development. Carla Gugino is wow really bad I almost laughed. I didn't like the soundtrack overall sometimes it works and sometimes not. I don't like how Zack Snyder chooses to make like a music video scene in his movies, mainly because the music is bad.<br/><br/>So overall just see it as an action movie and nothing else and you will be pleased but if your are expecting a very good story(Brazil, inception), or great performances you will be very disappointed."

"kingstonhawke","3","2","7","25 November 2012"," A Dumb Movie Disguised As A Smart Movie
","Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to me that a ton of people are making this out to be a great movie simply because they couldn't understand it, and they feel to do otherwise would be an admission of ignorance. Don't worry, it's not you...<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is a convoluted mess, that suffers critically from an identity crisis. <br/><br/>But, who to blame? Is it the writer's for trying to pack too much ""story"" into a 2 hour limit? Was it the person who was too dumb to realize that you can't have a movie that deals with this many adult subjects and fit it into a PG13 shell without editing it to bits? Throw in sub-par acting, and I'm leaning towards ""all of the above"".<br/><br/>Keep in mind I only saw the theatrical version (the version THEY chose to present)...<br/><br/>I'm going to try to be brief and just note the major flaws in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is overly vague. They were going for the effect at the end of Inception where it was really up to you to interpret the events the way you like. But asking the audience to connect the dots how they like ONLY works if the position that the dots are in makes at least some sense. These dots are scattered all over the place causing inconsistent underdeveloped, extremely one dimensional characters across the board. <br/><br/>The BabyGirl killing (or thinking that she did) her sister scene makes no sense at all. This is the foundatition to the whole movie, and even after reading other reviews I still don't know what happened. All I know is that it doesn't make any sense for that bullet to have killed her sister in that way. Or for her to even have taken only one shot and then bypass her dad to check on her sister who was ALREADY DEAD. How exactly was a labotomy going to fix this anyway? Labatomies only turn you into a veggie if they go wrong. That's a real medical procedure, why would he be counting on that to erase her memory?<br/><br/>2. I understand that it doesn't make sense to make a fighting movie that's rated R because all those teeens that make up that demo count for a lot of dollars. But then you shouldn't of made a movie with such adult themes. Because what ended up happening is that they couldn't show anything adult like, and instead the movie ended up being nothing but vague subtext. Was it even an actual whore house or not?<br/><br/>3. You can't have a bunch of things that make no sense, and then say it's OK because she was dreaming. That's a cop out. She really mesmerizes people so much with her dancing that they completely lose touch with reality? Really? That was an awful idea. More awful is that you never see her actually dance. Instead, they use this as a dumb excuse to try and reel in a young audience with drawn out fight scenes. Time that should be spent developing characters. Don't get me wrong, the fight scenes look fun. But they are predictable as heck. Even the one that included the curveball of her friend dying was telegraphed horribly.<br/><br/>Everyone talking about courage and what not. How? She had a mental break down and instead of getting it together and getting out of the situation she stabbed a dude, started a fire, and helped someone escape all while out of touch with reality. Bleu the orderlies friends turning on him and saying ""let's stop hurting girls"" was retarded also. Way to be consistent. They've been doing that for how long and all the sudden decide that they are gonna snitch on him as if he wont tell on them right back?<br/><br/>I feel like I'm ranting... but seriously, movies like this frustrate me. Sucker Punch needs to get off of it's high horse and realize that there's nothing impressive about leaving a million holes in a story and then asking the audience to fill in all of them for you."
"reeseslightning","2","2","7","13 December 2011"," Best Music Video Ever
","The entire time I was watching this I kept thinking, ""Oh my God! This should be honored as the longest and coolest music video of all time."" Because that's basically what it is. There were more songs than lines of dialog.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty solid when you actually think about it. A young girl is put into an insane asylum (where apparently, they dress like young schoolgirls...) because her stepfather is evil.<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is the execution of that plot; it's all fluff and no substance. They had a great opportunity to really do something with the plot, but instead they go for a knock off of Inception - a fantasy within a fantasy within a movie.<br/><br/>Are we supposed to care about these characters? Because there is no indication that we should. Of course, there are the femenazi's out there who will complain that this is sexist and appeals only to men because the girls are cliché hot girls dressed in skimpy outfits with their stereotypical personalities (the innocent one, scared one, strong ass kicking one, etc.) and they're almost right. But the point of having them be so cliché is directly against the actual message. It's this opposition that makes the message of the movie stand out.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were pretty cool and turns out that Vanessa Hudgens can do more than sing silly songs and take nude pics of herself - she can kick ass. And I really want to like Emily Browning, but good lord she makes it difficult!<br/><br/>They should've stuck with the asylum plot and then have the second fantasy (the cool part in other words) only. The going back and forth was confusing and you often got a flash of the real world before going back to the first fantasy world. There was just so much wrong with this movie.<br/><br/>Just fast forward through all the crappy dialog (seriously, there's nothing important)and get straight to the 2nd fantasy. At least that part is entertaining.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is so bad, it's good. It'll be in my ""guilty pleasures"" section of my movie collection."

","This movie was an overall disappointment. While the graphics/special effects, the set development, and costume design etc. were no let down: The overall storyline and character development was totally underdone and lazy. I expected more. <br/><br/>The acting efforts are lousy, with the only enjoyable and believable performance coming from Carla Gugino. Although the storyline holds a concept that could have been used for a killer film the execution falls flat. The film seems extremely disconnected and random, with emphasis being on pointless action scenes instead of any real content in regards to plot. No emotions are ever connected to any of the characters, despite them being abused victims in a corrupt system and the perceived ""moral of the story"" is very rarely portrayed or felt by the watcher. <br/><br/>The most disappointing part is that I believe the concept of the film and the characters could have potentially been developed to create an amazing film both visually, AND mentally: but sadly this movie relies on cool SFX and pretty girls dressed as prostitutes."

","Zack Snyder is a brilliant director. That doesn't automatically make him a competent neurosurgeon, or a trophy-winning stunt pilot. And it sure as heck doesn't make him a halfway passable writer.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is a beautifully directed mess. The story - especially the ending - is so incoherent it's difficult to judge the film's meaning or message. Or even decide whether it had one. The title, in particular, seems to have no other meaning than as a warning to the viewer: this film IS a 'sucker punch.' Drop your guard, and it will steal two hours of your life. And I say this as a huge fan of Snyder's previous work, and someone with a very high tolerance for surrealist fantasies (from directors like Gilliam, del Toro and others.)<br/><br/>Sucker Punch does have some redeeming virtues. The largely female cast is appealing, though saddled with some of the most dreadfully lame dialog ever uttered by human lips. The visual style is great, as you'd expect from Snyder. The imagery, mixing B-25, Zeppelins, zombie stormtroopers and dragons, is borderline brilliant - but wasted. Alas, the music is particularly gruesome, consisting of lifeless, over-produced generic re-workings of classic rock tunes like White Rabbit. Had the music had any spark of creativity, the film might actually have worked as some sort of lengthy music video.<br/><br/>I guess after adapting the work of great writers like Frank Miller and Alan Moore, Snyder got to thinking it didn't look so hard. He was wrong. Writing is the most difficult of all creative skills. Let's hope that for his next project Snyder comes to his senses and remembers his core skills as a director, and leaves the writing to those with some minimal talent for it."

I've also no idea why an American was leading a group of British in a trench war, but I'll over-look bad casting since the film was deliberately nonsensical anyhow, in an asinine attempt to bring art house into the mainstream (and the Sugarcubes' Hit was better than any of Bjork's solo stuff anyway!).<br/><br/>I guess it could be said now that I've wasted even more time by writing this comment, but in truth, the rant has been cathartic - I can now remove this steaming pile of dog doo from my mind and enjoy the remainder of my evening.<br/><br/>On a final note: 300 was turd but gave us Sparticus: Blood and Sand as a result. I respect Snyder's work from a directive point of view, but as a writer, he needs to get his fracking head together! I think any would-be writers watching this should've learnt pretty quickly how NOT to write a screenplay.<br/><br/>I'd seriously recommend anyone who happens to read this to avoid this film at all costs; cinema is rife was brilliance of all genres, so there's really no excuse to be suckered into watching this... well, not unless the hot girls with guns and swords convince you otherwise."

","I'll begin with a good analogy. You should know by now that every porno flick has the same formula – a terrible storyline, and hot scenes at every interval. You don't watch a porno for the story. You click 'forward' and get to the good parts. Why do they even need to have a story, you ask? To tie it all together, that's the only reason. This movie is action porn. The plot is so, so bad. I mean REALLY bad. If you pay attention to the plot, then you will feel lobotomized. When you see the first action scene, you will be amazed, and you may even feel that this was worth your time and/or money – but, don't let this fool you, my friend.

","Let me explain something, I am a 20 year old male who went into a cinema to watch a fantasy action film involving huge explosions, hot girls kicking ass in ridiculously hot outfits, and some fantastic visuals. So why did I hate this film so much? <br/><br/>The opening scene in the film is completely different from the usual Zach Snyder and at that point I was fascinated as to where it was going to go and the plot on the surface actually seems fascinating but it ends up with so many holes that it just infuriated me.<br/><br/>The typical Zach Snyder calling cards make continual appearances in this film; action packed, plenty of slow mo, some fantastic visuals and a plot that on the surface makes you want to see more.<br/><br/>All that being said this ends up being a very forgettable film that has a very convoluted and hard to believe plot (and I'm a fan of Oceans Eleven), the special effects are overemphasized to the point that everything else suffers, and the whole thing feels like a trailer for a bad video game.<br/><br/>What annoys me (and ninety percent of the population) the most is Zach Snyder having the balls to say that this is a empowering film for women. This is a teenage boys fantasy that Snyder dreamed up when he was thirteen.<br/><br/>This is Snyder's pet project and it shows just how much creative depth he actually has."

","I have to add yet another review of this movie, because in all the above it came to my mind that one thing is not standing out enough: Sucker Punch is no realistic movie and it does not try to be! Yes, the characters are not super developed, yes the action is over the top, yes the movie does not get the tension out of the fights. You guys are absolutely right about this.<br/><br/>But this movie is also interesting because you care about Baby Doll and her being lobotomized or not. It is great because the action is so beautifully filmed that you won't forget the scenes for a long time. And this movie is far deeper than most would expect. You just have to use your brain which seems to be difficult, because in most movies that are made like sucker, you don't need any brain.<br/><br/>If you liked the style of 300 and you can like a movie even though it is not realistic, you will also like this movie...

"d_art","8","2","7","1 April 2011"," 'Sucker Punch' packs just enough punch.
","In Sucker Punch, Emily Browning plays Baby Doll, a young girl who is locked away in a mental asylum by her abusive stepfather where she is scheduled to undergo lobotomy in five days. While there, her mind retreats into a semi-fantasy world where she and four female inmates are plotting to escape the facility. She then retreats to a deeper fantasy world, where she is fighting samurais, robotic soldiers, and dragons with her four friends. There, she is told about the five items that she needs to find in the facility that will help her escape from the asylum.<br/><br/>The film starts off stylistically surreal. The muted colors and sharp contrasts convey a nightmarish reality that flows without words, much like a music video. With sharp attention to detail, close-ups, and a moody cover of Sweet Dreams (that Annie Lennox made famous) in the background, the scenes that unfold are implied more than spelt out. Within five minutes of the film, Baby Doll winds up in the asylum, falsely accused of murdering her sister and then attacking her stepfather. As she enters the theater section of the asylum, the room is morphed into a night club / bordello, where the orderlies are now formally-dressed night club operators. Here, she befriends Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), and Amber (Jamie Chung) who are stuck there as late night entertainers. Every so often, when Baby Doll is forced to do a dance for a client or an audience, she retreats to yet another fantasy world (think Inception, like a dream within a dream) where she is given a different mission each time to battle samurai robots and other nefarious baddies with her four friends.<br/><br/>While fighting in this alternate world, these characters wear what would be considered fetish fashion—they are in military, leather, and school girl outfits. While one can argue that these clothes are simply what comic book heroines wear, it is perhaps more of an allusion to the fact that the four characters are, in reality, prostitutes inside the facility. Many of the fantastic scenes appear to be metaphors, giving some clue of what could be happening outside the fantasy world. Advertisement<br/><br/>Emily Browning and the female crew do a great job looking cool while shootings guns, doing crazy jumps, and swinging swords. There is no doubt that director Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen) can direct effectively choreographed fighting scenes. There are lots of it and tons of explosions and hails of bullets. This world uses video game physics, with nods to anime and sci-fi / fantasy / geek culture. To a casual viewer, however, this will seem like a waste of time, an overt focus on style over substance (and it is rather true). While these action scenes are impressive to look at, they are almost entirely computer-generated, and given that this is a fantasy world, any tension of being in actual danger is minimized (a similar issue I had with Inception). With that said, this film does quite well in the action scenes. The visuals are amazing. It's a pity there's more beauty than tension. As for the plot itself, it isn't too complex. <br/><br/>Admittedly, this film could have been a strong psychological thriller had the focus on style and pop culture was less pronounced and at least less modern. One assumes this film takes place around the 50's (or earlier), but many of the fantasy action scenes have a modern sensibility in fashion, guns, and mechs. Given that this is all part of Baby Doll's fantasy, one wonders if she may have been playing video games, watching anime, and reading modern sci-fi books. Nevertheless, this film packs enough punch where it counts. <br/><br/>If you want updates on more of my reviews, you can find them on http://twitter.com/d_art"
"TheChampReview","6","2","7","31 March 2011"," An Enjoyable Movie. If you love good action then its a Must see!
","Before we start let me just say that I'm a sucker for action, fantasy, adventure flicks. It's a love of mine and I was most definitely pleased with all of the actions sequences presented in the movie. The first ten minutes of the movie were done well because the set up of the story was more visual and didn't waste time using dialogue to ""lead"" the audience. Before I say anything the cinematography and the score were done very well. My favorite scenes were the very first fight scene in the snow and the last fight scene set in the future with the robots.<br/><br/>The acting was watchable. I was skeptical on how the girl from High School Musical and the other girl from SAVED would do playing sexy, tough women but they pulled it off. Many people said that this movie was ""every nerds fantasy"" to see hot girls, in skimpy clothes, fighting bad guys. Fortunately, the costumes weren't all that skimpy and although all five actresses are very attractive, when the time comes for them to fight it is very believable.<br/><br/>Now like any movie, I do have my inhbitions. There were a lot of holes in the story and when you leave the theatre and ponder the movie, you do say to yourself ""wait that didn't make sense"". Why is that our main characters dancing is SO great that it distracts any man from from their surroundings? Why did these four girls let this random stranger who they only knew for a couple days talk them into risking their lives for her? If her dancing was great why didn't we get to see any of it? If this fantasy world was meant to be an escape from the torturous reality of this whorehouse, why did she enter it when she did it willingly.....it defeats the purpose of creating a fantasy world.<br/><br/>But of course I went in the theatre clear of all inhibitions and expectations. I freed my mind and allowed myself just to enjoy the movie. I didn't pay money to sit through the whole movie and whisper to my friend everything that doesn't work. I just allowed myself to enjoy what was put on the screen. I did feel like the director wanted to deliver a combination of emotion and action. Unfortunately, the emotional portion of it wasn't all tat convincing.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a fun movie. Just know that when you purchase it on DVD this summer, it'll be one of those films where you skip to all the actions scenes."

"paperback_wizard","7","2","7","30 March 2011"," Not a sucker bet
","Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch is an original, charming, visually stunning movie that, while it may not win over every theatergoer, still packs a serious one-two punch.<br/><br/>One reviewer described it as Kill Bill meets Inception. I don't know that I'd go that far, but it certainly has elements of both. It's a cerebral action film that operates on several different levels at once. The first level, the ""real"" world of the movie, is set in a primitive insane asylum where a dishonest orderly abuses and terrorizes the girls under his care. The newest addition to the madhouse is known simply as Baby Doll, played by Emily Browning (The Uninvited, A Series of Unfortunate Events). Baby Doll must find a way to escape the asylum before she really does lose her mind; and she needs to help the other girls escape, as well.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie is simple enough, and rather mundane; but seen through Baby Doll's eyes, it takes place in a multi-level world. The next level up from ""reality"" is an old-fashioned cabaret, where Baby Doll and the other patients are all dancing girls and the crooked orderly becomes a pimp, renting or even selling them to the high rollers. While the girls gather everything needed to implement Baby Doll's plan to escape, the movie ascends to another, even more exciting level of fantasy, one alternately filled with samurai monsters, steampunk zombie armies, dragon castles, and robot soldiers.<br/><br/>It's certainly one of the most interesting movies I've seen in years. But, there's also plenty to criticize about it. Though it's based on an original story by the director, it is rather derivative. And while the battle sequences that supposedly serve as metaphors for Baby Doll's struggles are captivating, they are far from perfect metaphors. The biggest misfire, though, I'd say is Scott Glenn as the Wise Man. He appears in each fantasy sequence to give Baby Doll and the girls directions. However, his ""wisdom"" is more than a little cliché, and doesn't always fit in the context of the scenes.<br/><br/>Still, I'd call it a solid effort by Snyder, who is used to adapting other people's stories (Watchmen, 300). The acting and chemistry among the girls is a testament to their acting abilities (the group consists of actresses Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, and Jamie Chung, each of whom is due for a breakout role in film). Oscar Isaacs (Robin Hood, Body of Lies) is convincing as the ruthless orderly/cabaret owner, as is Carla Gugino (Watchmen) as Doctor/Madam Gorski. The film even features a special appearance by Mad Men's Jon Hamm as the High Roller whose arrival would spell the end for Baby Doll.<br/><br/>In the end, much of the criticism of Zack Snyder's latest film, I feel, is unwarranted. This film may not break any box office records, but it's a great film for people who enjoy intrigue, action, and adventure. And really, the ""fanservice"" isn't all that prevalent, or even that gratuitous. Yes, Baby Doll and the other girls are often shown in either their cabaret outfits or kicking butt in short skirts, but it's all in the context of the story (yeah, I know it sounds cliché, but it's true). The action sequences are fantastic, the visuals are breathtaking, and the camera work is topnotch. The storyline may not challenge you to the degree that Inception did, but it does make you think.<br/><br/>(Originally appeared at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/reports)"
"craig-boyd91","7","2","7","29 March 2011"," Not great, but good fun all the same!
","Zack Snyder is without a doubt one of the best up and coming directors around. Watchmen and 300 are two of the best and most faithful Comic Book movies ever made. His visual style is incredible, and even though he remains faithful to the source; his style manages to add something new and invigorating to those graphic masterpieces. But every director has their missteps every now and then. Sucker Punch is Zack's first.<br/><br/>When I say Snyder is a good director I mean just that... DIRECTOR! The man thrives with source material, but the problem here is... There is no source material. Zack Snyder co-wrote Sucker-Punch, and after watching it I believe the man should pick up a pen never again. The writing for Sucker Punch was nothing more than set-up after set-up for cool visuals, and that never works out very well Mr. Snyder.(see Avatar) However with that said, the visuals, and video game look and feel alone make this movie worth a trip to the theater.<br/><br/>The big problem with Sucker Punch is that it never tries to tie in the ""Dream Worlds"" with the ""Real World"". Yeah there end up being some real world consequences, but the action in the dreams never assimilate what's going on in reality. Having better tie-ins could have easily improved the movies dull conclusion. Instead the movie ends up playing out like a series of video game boss battles, which end up not being pretty fun to watch. If you go into Sucker Punch expecting mindless fun you'll get it, and you'll enjoy the hell out of it.<br/><br/>All-in-all Sucker Punch isn't as bad as critics are making it out to be, but it is by no means great. It is a fun time at the movies, and like a video game, it's better with friends.<br/><br/>6 out of 10"
"pittstonjoma","6","2","7","28 March 2011"," Disappointing
","I saw Sucker Punch today, and I was extremely disappointed. It was nothing like I expected it to be, and not in a good way.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I didn't know very much about the movie, except for what a friend told me. I knew that at least one of the characters was wrongly institutionalized, but I expected her to be able to get out and exact her revenge. I expected a happy ending. I expected that these women would warp to and from an alternate universe, and, by fighting various battles and doing various quests, they would achieve victory and better circumstances in the real world. I expected a decent plot, with everything developed and explained as the plot moved along. I expected these women to develop a strong bond and also for them to become best friends even after they won their ultimate victory. I expected these women to be powerful and empowering characters. Admittedly, I expected this movie to be a LOT better than what it actually was. The concept was great, and the visuals were nice. The plot left a lot to be desired, though. <br/><br/>*************Warning, spoilers ahead!************************<br/><br/>What REALLY happened:<br/><br/>The protagonist (Baby Doll) did NOT make it out of the institution. She instead was lobotomized (WTF) even though she wasn't crazy! Therefore, she did not get revenge upon her evil and murderous stepfather. She did not get her revenge against the slime ball that operated the mental institution. She got absolutely nothing out of the situation except for epic failure. I mean, she doesn't even get to ESCAPE! I thought that was the whole POINT of the film! Instead, her friend gets to escape. The one that gets to escape was the annoying one, the naysayer, and the least agreeable and likable character of the main female characters. WTF?!<br/><br/>The ending was NOT a happy one. I found myself to be depressed after the film ended.<br/><br/>There were 2 different alternate universes in the film, which was not obvious for way too long. One was some sort of brothel, and the other was like a video game. They almost never warped back to the real world, so you had no idea if most of the characters in the film even existed. There was also no way to know what really happened and what implications the actions of the characters in the false worlds had on the real world, with the exception of the last third or so of the film. I wish they would have not had the brothel world at all and just had the real world and the game world. That would have been fine. It was also lame that they ""danced"" in order to get to the game world, but you never saw any of the dancing. It was especially weird because they were trying to make you believe that Baby Doll was so good that she stunned her enemies and made everyone loudly applaud her. The gaming world also made no sense. What happened in the world made no sense in terms of the plot or the character that was dreaming about it. Hell, the gaming world couldn't even stand by itself as a legit world. It was just a bunch of random fuckery that seemed ripped off of various games, movies, and animes. Admittedly, that probably bothered me the least because the gaming world was, at least, probably the most entertaining part of the movie. I was honestly pretty disappointed that there wasn't more of the gaming world in the movie. I'd say that 75% of the movie was the weird brothel fuckery. I don't get it. What did the brothel nonsense have to do with anything? Why was it most of the movie?<br/><br/>There wasn't much of a plot, and nothing made much sense. The only real thing that the movie had going for it was that the gaming world was pretty. Who cares? I didn't come to see a pretty picture. I came to see a story. The characters weren't even developed! They could have had a lot going for the film if they developed the characters! Baby Doll and Rocket's friendship especially had a lot going for it. Why didn't they have Rocket stay alive and help save Baby Doll much like she saved Rocket? <br/><br/>The women were only empowering in the gaming world. Even then, they epic failed in the last mission and almost failed in the one before that. In the other worlds, they were pretty much helpless.<br/><br/>I am so disappointed because they could have done so much better! I also really wanted Baby Doll to get her revenge on her stepfather! He was vile scum of the earth, and he did not get any sort of punishment in the film. Why not?"
"matthewvern-1","7","2","7","28 March 2011"," I thought it rocked
","I had this idea that I knew what I was getting myself into when I saw this movie for the first time in a trailer a while ago, during a video game expo. Zach Snyder has a great time making his films, which I enjoy as a viewer, and I assume the actresses and actors he hires are ready and willing to have a blast alongside everyone else involved. This movie was over the top with its action and mind blowing with its visuals, both actual and rendered, which is a core idea behind making a great action movie. I think Sucker Punch succeeded in making a must buy Blu Ray for me at least for the action and more. A group of girls in an orphanage/dance club who want to escape was something I gathered upon first seeing the trailer and quickly assumed the story would be a hard sell in ways. The story wasn't as grand as Zach Snyder's previous films but it had, in its heart, what I considered a fun romp in itself. I was surprised when I watched the film because it didn't lead me down a path I predicted and all the while it kept my attention and consideration without taking me out of the experience and I loved that. The script played out like a video game during the action bits and as an avid gamer I was excited to watch and listen. The action bits pieced together the story as ""Baby Doll"" dances in the club which I enjoyed because the action was awesome to behold. I found myself understanding the characters motives more than I got to understand the characters themselves which was unfortunate because the splendor the film portrays doesn't do the characters justice in my opinion. I did feel a sense of gratification after the film was over because it lead me down a fun path that I wasn't ready for and I really liked that about it. Its characters were fighters and they fought hard alongside Snyder's imagination to make what I think was a great, fun film. Fight on."

","I'm sure a lot of people will dislike this movie because it throws everything at us but the kitchen sink (and throws that too) and its ending. The professional & semi-professional critics certainly haven't been impressed. But I had a lot of fun until near the end and that counts for something.<br/><br/>We get hot babes using kung-fu moves, swords and almost every gun ever made short of lasers is used. There are giant samurai, zombie Nazis, a big mecha suit, orcs, robots, armored knights, a huge fire breathing dragon,all kinds of air-vehicles, a train on a floating tracks, jetpacks, a bombastic rock score, and explosions of varying sizes.<br/><br/>Is it overkill? Maybe. The movie runs two hours and takes a simple story of young women trying to escape an asylum and throws in whatever it can, taking us into not one, but two levels of dreamworld/fantasy in a way strangely similar to ""Inception"". And since this is the first film Synder made that ISN'T an adaptation, it's the first time he is able to give a movie a moral...though it doesn't come through as strongly as he may have intended.<br/><br/>The cast is game, but they are often swept away in the comic book/video game mayhem. At the top is Scott Glen as the wise man who acts as Baby Doll's ""little voice"" & gives the girls assignments that parallel to their escape plans. He seems to be having good time with it. On the bottom is Vanessa Hudgens, whose character does little & is the last likable of the heroines and tries too hard to wring out a big performance from a fairly small role. Everyone else falls somewhere in between between. Emily Browning is good to look at with her pigtails and school girl style outfit (she kinda looks like Sailor Moon, especially in one outfit she wears near the end) and she gives an earnest performance, there's something off about her I can't quite put my finger on...<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the story takes a tragic turn in the third act after all the over the top action that hurts it. And the ending, while satisfying (to me anyway) was far from what I was expecting (though to be fair, the film own trailers warned we wouldn't see it coming).<br/><br/>If you just want to watch a movie for a good time & to be entertained, you will be (especially those of you are good at riffing).

The ending was really powerful and moving for me, and I was also pleased to see that it was not a happy ending. I was kind of disappointed that the only character I didn't like lived, but I was pleased that it was a tragic ending (I know it sounds strange, but I don't like typical feel good endings). I will definitely purchase this movie when it releases to DVD. The action scenes were perfectly done, and I was surprised at how well it was done for being PG-13.

Aimlessly building a sexual appetite only carries filming so far with incoherent plots present... Unless its pornography. Which Sucker Punch (unfortunately) isn't.<br/><br/>4/10... Edible, but bitter and non-alcoholic."
"Silverhawkins","Null","2","8","26 April 2014"," A certificate 12 sex show
","I'd like to say Sucker Punch is an ambivalent film that functions on a multitude of levels, that is meaningful or metaphorical, that raises some of the great tragedies of life; love and loss, betrayal, faith... But that would be horse dung, because all things considered, it really isn't about any of those things. It's about some beautiful feisty chicks with guns and swords - which is fine, damn fine in fact, it's just not all that interesting...<br/><br/>Sucker Punch kicks off with a ten minute montage for expositional purposes (kind of like The Fellowship of the Ring except minus the narration, filmed entirely in slow motion and much less tasteful). Since the plot is actually Super Mario simple, I'll summarise<br/><br/>In an unlikely, pistol-wielding struggle versus the abuse of her evil stepfather, a girl unintentionally kills her sister and winds up in an asylum, declared ""mentally insane"" and set for lobotomy. She retreats in to an alternate reality where in a truly epic flight of fantasy she imagines herself as a showgirl, Baby Doll, who believes the road to freedom requires four things: a map, fire, a knife and a key. Actually there is also a fifth, ""mystery"" thing, but to reveal that would be a spoiler. If things are already sounding a little bizarre, get this: Baby Doll gets these items by enticing their rightful owners in to a trance with her hypnotic dancing (which you never actually get to see - Emily Browning is obviously no Nat Portman!) whilst her fellow showgirls steal them. Oddly enough, although the plot is ludicrous, in a serious psycho-drama (directed by Aronofsky for instance) it could easily have worked. However, in this context with Snyder at the helm, the whole premise is just a platform to show off fit girls kicking ass in glorious CG fantasy landscapes. And why not?<br/><br/>Well, I'll tell you why. Because once the initial arousal has worn off, and yes, it is basically a certificate 12 sex show, the film struggles to combat the biggest nemesis of all: boredom. It is cool seeing a pigtailed teenager dual-wielding a samurai sword and a handgun and nailing dragons and undead-clockwork-Nazis, but for how long? After the first few objects have been acquired and their respective battles have been fought, the formula already seems old. Girl fights freaks, girl retrieves special item (insert gamer achievement here), girl returns to alternate reality to dance some more, rinse and repeat (as the saying goes) It's a series of events as inevitable as Scott Pilgrim's tiresome battles against the seven evil exes, except Wright's was a film packed full of comedy and with it's tongue firmly in it's cheek. God only knows where Snyder's tongue is as he drools over these nymphettes.<br/><br/>The visuals are generally spectacular (although with so much CGI there is ineluctably going to be some slip ups) and the combat choreography is balletic, not to mention hugely sexual. Sexual combat might seem like an oxymoron, especially if S&M isn't your bag and you've never watched the swimming pool fight/ sex scene in Goldeneye, but Emily Browning is happy to set you straight (no pun intended). Whilst Zack Snyder might claim that the film tackles the risky topic of female empowerment - arming them to the teeth seems to take that a tad literally - the casual observer won't see beyond the pouts and the mini-skirts, and honestly, they probably wouldn't find anything of substance even if they did.<br/><br/>But hang about. We can't judge Sucker Punch like we'd judge the average movie. There is a time and a place for mindless, sexualised violence, and if you dig that vibe ie. you are male and between the ages of 14 and 17 (or 65+) then good for you - this is a film which will most likely float your boat.<br/><br/>In all fairness, the cast is pretty strong. The acting is more than adequate, the right mix of saucy and fragile (that's a fine line if ever there was one!) and there are a few familiar faces. The main foursome of showgirls were evidently not chosen for their acting prowess but that's not to say they do a bad job, you might just be more used to their acting style from teen slashers and the like. Oscar Isaac is devilishly wicked as the prime villain of the piece, Blue Jones; Jon Hamm plays the usual straight ahead chap in what is either a cameo or the smallest role he's been cast since his career boomed with Mad Men, and Carla Gugino (who is on a bit of a roll recently - Californication, Faster) is cringeworthy but apt as psychiatrist/ brothel director Vera Gorski. Oh, and one other thing...Scott Glenn will elicit a few laughs as the Wise Man who offers words of caution and advice to Baby Doll (and whose existence is totally inexplicable).<br/><br/>A few people have been raving about the soundtrack, and by people I mean forum-lubbers and critics alike, but they're all overzealous in their plaudits. Sure, the heavy rock kicks the action sequences up a notch, but it's nothing new or original, and in fact, the soundtrack cover of The Pixies classic 'Where Is My Mind?' is an insult to the original tune and the spirit in which it was written, not to mention being a massive, obvious cliché for a film set in an asylum.<br/><br/>I wasn't under any illusions that Sucker Punch would hold any depth, but I was hoping that it would at least be mindnumbing and thrilling entertainment. I concede that it was mindnumbing"
"thirdeblue","2","2","8","2 January 2012"," Misconceived
","Baby doll gets set to an insane asylum for accidentally killing her sister when she meant to kill her abusive stepfather. The rest of the movie is a prolonged fantasy as she tries to escape the asylum before she is lobotomized.<br/><br/>There is no delicate way to put this, this movie completely fails and its entirely at the feet of Zack Snyder.<br/><br/>Simply put the dream sequences are stupid and considering 95% of the movie is a fantasy, that gives you maybe ten minutes of usable movie, but even that is tainted by pointless CGI and directed like a music video.<br/><br/>Imagine Shutter Island, now remove the suspense, and add CGI ninjas, dragons, helicopters, and zombie Nazis and you have Sucker Punch. I literally fast-forwarded through one of the action sequences set on a train. Oh, that had robots. Add that to the list of unnecessary CGI filler that this movie could have done without.<br/><br/>The most galling part about the dream sequences is the shear absurdity of them. I believe this movie is a period piece, set in the 1960s, yet we have a 20 year old woman dreaming of 21rst century technology, like digital displays on the mech and helicopter. The fantasies in the movie are not the fantasies of the character Baby Doll like the movie would have us believe, they are the fantasies of the director Zack Snyder. I did not believe for one second that Baby Doll would even have these fantasies.<br/><br/>If the main character had been male and the movie had been set today, the fantasies would have still be unnecessary, pointless filer, but at least I could have believed the were fantasies of the main character. As it stands...garbage.<br/><br/>This movie will never hold a candle to Shutter Island. If you ever feel the need to watch Sucker Punch, stick two TVs next to each other and watch Shutter Island and Chicago at the same time."
"ghasl1","4","2","8","21 April 2011"," Leaves you answering more questions to the end
","This movie has some good action scenes, girls and cgi but the story is not straight forward so the audience cant understand what is what and its because of loopholes.<br/><br/>By that you cant tell what is the main story from the dream story that is made up from Baby Doll's head (main character) or its from the lobotomy (before or after), split personality disorder, envisions of how things turn out, is it one person or different perspectives from characters or go with the flow type movie.<br/><br/>Usually there is an indication if there dreaming, like a totem, they feel pain or a trigger switch to wake up there was none of that. There was only the chef with a missing knife, the charred fire on the wall and a few other things that happened. You cant tell after the caretakers say stuff that only Baby Doll herself would know. It leaves you answering one question after another. I can only recommend that you just watch the action scenes everything else wont make a difference. I wish it was one sided and people wouldn't have to make there own conclusions."
"AsirenYen","3","2","8","6 April 2011"," Written with PG-13 in mind
","I went into the movie knowing that there was a fantastical element to the storyline, and that it was an action movie. It definitely contained both of these elements.<br/><br/>However, in the desperation to maintain a PG-13 rating while showing as much barely-legal flesh as possible, the movie makes the action sequences repetitive and dull. To enable a high body-count but maintain a low ""death count"" and gore level, enemies are either undead, fantastical or mechanical. (And the dialog to establish these facts is diabolical.) The CGI is impressive at times, though the majority of images appears to have been lifted either out of previous movies or out of recent computer games. Action sequences work most of the time, but the repetitive and constant nature makes inconsistencies such as stunt doubles and CGI'ed representations much more noticeable.<br/><br/>The acting is reasonable when required, but as would be expected from an action movie, there are large expanses of the movie where these skills are not. Wardrobe choices are chosen purely for the titillation factor, with the majority of the movie being a poor excuse to move the storyline into a setting where more flesh can be shown.<br/><br/>The ""moral"" of the story is delivered at the end with the finesse of a sledgehammer, and the relevance and flavour of a stale after-dinner mint.<br/><br/>All-in-all, the movie is an obvious vehicle for the actresses involved to try and shed their good-girl images without shedding their clothes completely, but fails so show anything more of them other than what they're hiding."
"mktoasty","8","2","8","6 April 2011"," Ignore the critics and see this movie. It will tickle your id.
","First off, I love all the negative reviews of this movie. Critics (the public) are so quick to judge. This movie did what it promised. A trip through a dark reality depicted with a good taste of original style. Snyder knows how to create a powerful opening scene. The man uses slow motion. So what? he does it well. As for the acting? It was appropriate. It didn't need Oscar performances. And for the soundtrack? Very fitting, and very well chosen. This movie was not hard to grasp. I pity those who were confused. And if you're asking yourself ""where were the characters?"" They were stuck in between the realms of the different realities. Funny, that's where he wanted the audience to be. If you didn't become engaged with this movie then go back home and watch the Social Network.. If you recognized the cover of ""Where is my mind"" at the beginning of the film, then this movie was intended for you."

","If you're seeking a realistic story, this is not it. As an imaginative, Gothic (while futuristic), cinematic experience - this film takes you there. Comic book novel-like story and pacing - without being overly campy or silly. Action scenes are extremely well choreographed and visually breathtaking, battle sets are haunting and alone worth seeing. The acting is appropriate for the film, and the villains and adversaries are truly frightening. Best seen in IMAX. Destined as a sleeper cult classic because of it's style and marketing, nonetheless - a very worthwhile see for those who have a wide range of tastes in film."
"karmagrl76","4","2","8","29 March 2011"," Sucker Punch or Punch Sucked...you be the judge.
","Went to see Sucker Punch the other night, and I have to say, I'm impressed. Not with the plot, mind you. The plot was nowhere to be found. I was impressed with the fact that one movie could get away with stealing from so many others. Beowulf, Hellboy, Shutter, Lord of the Rings, and Face Off among others. And although I haven't practiced martial arts in quite some time, I'm pretty sure it is nigh impossible to fight off hoards of clockwork zombies/orcs/whatever while wearing heals and a sailor suit school girl outfit regardless of what I've seen of anime or what my pervy boyfriend claims. Insert glare here.<br/><br/>Its biggest problem is the plot-what little could be found-doesn't really come to anything until the end. You spend most of the movie scratching your head trying to figure out what the hell is going on. Oh, and the plot holes! Ugh! Babydoll(Emily Browning)is told by the ""wise man"" to find five items to escape her tormentors. She and her cohorts go through great lengths and a lot of psychedelic ass kicking trying to acquire these ""necessities"" that any fool with sticky fingers and a little common sense could have lifted in under an hour. Better yet, why not pry yourself from your dream world long enough to tell Doc Gorski(Carla Gugino), the one person who might be on your side, ""Hey, my dad paid one of your staff to forge your name on a document that will render me a vegetable for the rest of my life so he can inherit all my money. Might want to look in to that. Thanks."" Of course, that would have made the movie shorter. Or would have forced the director to come up with a better story line. Can't have that. Not in an action flick.<br/><br/>Its one saving grace, as with most action movies, is the special effects and fight scenes. Sailor suit be damned, the girls do kick some ass. A lot of ass. Well rendered, CGI ass, but ass none the less. And I thought the Wise Man (Scott Glenn) was kind of cool with his glib pronouncements, even if most of what he said was plagiarized from other speakers.<br/><br/>All in all, I think Sucker Punch was an okay movie that no one will admit to secretly liking. It might even become one of those cult classics which is the definitive word for movies no one likes to admit they like, at least not until someone cool does. Hey, Rocky Horror didn't have much of a plot either. Look how that turned out."

","Entertaining. Held my attention throughout. The shifting narrative was easy enough to follow but gave the film an appearance of a depth that just isn't there. Justice is a heavy theme and the payoff just isn't there. There is a lack of identity in most central characters and there's little emotional resonance as a consequence of this. Having said all this, I go back to my original statement. Think Michael Bay directing Inception 2 and you're not far away. Conceptually this film is magnificent. All credit should go to the screen writer. However, the major shortcomings as mentioned above leave a real sense of disappointment. Could have been a classic."

","I thought this would be a lot better then it was. the opening segments (that best describe as a music video) were, in my opinion , the best parts of this film, and the director shouldve stuck with that storyline making it a revenge film instead of the potpourri that we end up receiving! Basic newcomer Emily Browning (Lemony Snickett's a Series Of Unfortunate Events) plays Baby Doll in this, who after being framed by her evil step father for the killing of her younger sister, gets locked away in the local mental institute (I know we all have the local institute in our towns don't we? Mine being at my house) After advising, and a hefty bribe to the the on site man in charge to lobotomize her in an effort to 'silence' her from telling the real events of what happened to her sibling, she is left alone amongst the other crazies.<br/><br/>She befriends a band of renegade girls in the form of Rocket (Jena Malone) Amber (Jamie Chung) Blondie (Vannessa Hudgens) and Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) and gets them all involved in an escape plan to the UN-escapable institute. The director (Zack Snyder, Watchmen) paints a visual portrait of once again bringing yet another graphic comic book to life. Having the main character zip in and out of her very vivid imagination, warring with huge japan like creatures, a German army of the undead (reminded me so much of a video game i once played) all the whilst back in reality these fight occur during one of Baby Doll's erotic dances.

But don't get me wrong, it had it's weakness'. OK first off, the girls acting skills are horrible! Vanessa Hudgens literally had like five lines in the film and then she dies!! It was so dumb. Even Babydoll (the main character) is a horrible actress. Honestly, her face throughout the movie barely changed. It stayed the same and the story was just so weird! You think they're trapped in an insane asylum? Well they are, kinda, but they are sent there and become prostitutes! And they're mentor! OK that guy is just so stupid! Every time they went somewhere and he was there, he always said ""Oh and one more thing"" like he forgets something every time he talks to them. Also I don't really understand why they went to the places they go to. Like Nazi zombies? Really?. But I'm a guy so babes, guns and Nazi zombies are a perfect combo. Which is why I liked the movie.

"guitarzxt","7","2","9","26 March 2011"," Not too Bad
","For starter I think this movie really pushes the boundaries of a PG-13 rating, but that is a side note.<br/><br/>I loved the action sequences in this movie. Some of the CG shots are really sweet, and the action sequences are good also. The actual plot line of the movie had a lot to offer, but it would have been nice to have that story developed a little more. Instead there is a concentration on the actions scenes, which are pretty cool. <br/><br/>The style of the movie takes a little getting used to, but ultimately it adds to the story. <br/><br/>Finally, this movie has what might be called unnecessary hotness. What I mean by this is none of the women ever where ""normal cloths."" They wear hot looking cloths even when peeling potatoes. This is very similar to all of the ""oh by the way, Megan Fox is hot"" shots in Transformers 2. This is not only wholly unrealistic behavior, it is also distracting for the average healthy male.<br/><br/>Overall, it's not too bad of a movie, but not exactly what I was looking for."

","First of all you don't go to this kind of movie expecting an engaging storyline. You see a Snyder movie to watch the visual effects. I wasn't too sure about it at first, but it really grew on me. There were some questions that went unanswered and I really wish they had developed the characters more so that I had more invested in what happened to them, but like I said effects... not plot was the focus. It seems like in the move industry it is either effects or storyline, but never both and when there is a tinge of the two it is because there was a book or graphic novel first and it isn't an original story. I might be the only one that feels that way, but I don't think so. I had a good time watching this.

"jgregg42","6","2","9","25 March 2011"," ""Sucker Punch"" tries to hit you with its best shot.
","Baby Doll, Sweet Pea, Amber, Blondie and Rocket all must band together to fight zombies, giant samurais, dragons and robots to find five objects in order to escape the mental institute. That must have been as much information Zack Snyder (director of ""300"" and ""Watchmen"") was able to fit on his cocktail napkin as he drafted the screen play for ""Sucker Punch."" Snyder's original concept could be either an expansive epic tale with lots of eye candy for the fan boys or the plot to a late night Cinemax adult film. Take out the action scenes then add in a few ""adult situations"" and the story is basically the same.<br/><br/>We start our journey with the main focus of the five heroines, Baby Doll (played by Emily Browning). She narrates the opening scene telling us that we all have guardian angels watching over us. She then offers some psychobabble about how sometimes the bad things can also lead to good things.<br/><br/>In an opening sequence with very little dialogue, we see her mother die then there is a terrible accident that forces her evil stepfather to commit Baby Doll to an insane asylum. Once in the Asylum Baby Doll has five days before she is given a frontal lobe lobotomy.<br/><br/>From this point forward, the viewer should really shut his or her mind off and enjoy the ride. Nothing more is explained on how things work or even why they work in Snyder's world. This is a pure gratification film from the aesthetic viewpoint.<br/><br/>Baby Doll immediately learns how to use a cerebral performance to escape the asylum even if it is only in her mind. But where would a 20-year-old orphan escape to if she had the choice? Of course, she would choose to escape to a burlesque house. Yep, that's right, a place worse than the asylum. Now she has to run away from a sleazy pimp (played by Oscar Isaac) and his filthy clientele. Also, in this alternate world, she will also choose to wear scanty lingerie (hey, I'm on board with it).<br/><br/>Baby Doll soon finds that she can be a persuasive exotic dancer. While dancing she holds her viewers captive so that she can visit alternative realities. In her first trip she meets up with a wise sage (played by Scott Glenn) who gives her instructions on how to escape from her asylum/ burlesque house. He gives her a samurai sword and a fully loaded hand gun. Similar to the plot of many Xbox video games, she is given a task to do and each level becomes progressively harder. Luckily she bands together with four other girls who don't like wearing a lot of clothes either.<br/><br/>The plan is simple: Baby Doll dances to distract her captors while the four girls gather their needed objects to escape. Her dancing is so hypnotic that we, the audience, aren't even allowed to see her dance. Instead we see several extremely articulate action scenes all held together by a soundtrack with cover songs from The Beatles, The Pixies and Jefferson Airplane. It's a fair trade.<br/><br/>Should you see this movie? Only if you like action, fantasy, and young girls dressed in various seductive costumes (you know who you are).<br/><br/>The bulk of the film is an action fantasy that would make perfect sense to die-hard gamers, steam punkers, sci-fi geeks, and almost any dude under the age of 25. Right before the credits roll, we hear the message of why we were watching this orgy of guns, swords and cleavage for the last hour and a half. With that, Snyder mucks up a perfectly good visually amplified film by trying to add a deep meaning to it. I did feel sucker punched because of that effort."

"elshikh4","4","1","3","14 February 2013"," Punch Drunk !
","I have to begin by something Zack Snyder, the writer / director of Sucker Punch, said about this very movie: ""A while ago, I had written a script for myself, and there was a sequence in it, that made me think: How can I make a film that can have action sequences in it, that aren't limited by the physical realities that normal people are limited by, but still have the story make sense so it's not a thing like Ultraviolet or something like that?!""<br/><br/>OK, for starters this is not a bad movie. It's one about oppression, getting freedom, and knowing yourself while it, however, told by a different way that mixes dreams, with music video style, added to action. Seems cool. And it's cool indeed in a way. Though the ultimate outcome is weak, due to some reasons.<br/><br/>Firstly, the action sequences. They're imaginative and frantic, yes, but without the most important element that any action needs, which is the creditability. We all know, pretty well, that they're illusions in the heroine's head, as alternative expressions for other happenings, so the viewer's interplay with them is dead. Not to mention, that they suspend their main happenings as well. Simply, they seem like segments from another movie, that this one uses to interrupt itself. So how about their fact as dreams within another dream within reality?! Apparently, this is a case of a movie that encumbers itself by itself, to force some action anyway!<br/><br/>Secondly, the confusion. That mix of many dreams within another dream within reality-does bother, especially when you know by heart that the action dreams are unnecessary and stand in front the story's flow. That eventually formed a weird and exhausting plot of dramatically dead action, within interrupted illusionary thriller, within absent real another thriller! Let alone that it assembles many unanswered questions, like what was the equal of the heroine's dances in reality? Or how a murder, like the one that cook did, was kept secret?! Sure something tells you if the action sequences have been collected, and had any in-between, they would have made better movie. And if that one itself had a twist at its end, concerning being a dream of a girl who hates her reality or re-pictures it, then it would have been even better, like other twisty movies lately. Thus, writing it the way it is, lost many advantages, and created enough problems.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the characterization. If you want to do a movie about precious values, and not another brainless action, then you have to have well-made characters. But sorrowfully, this script didn't. All what we had was something like: pretty girl who can plan super smartly, and has such a highly cultured imagination (where did that come from?!). A girl who's worried about her sister. Then, that girl's sister. And so on! So, accordingly, what did you add to make your movie totally else ""a thing like Ultraviolet"", Mr. Snyder?!<br/><br/>Fourthly, why the movie treated its heroine, Emily Browning, as a Babydoll from the start? I know that turning her face, by heavy make-up, into a doll's face is something understood as long as takes place inside the limits of that casino / brothel. But since the first scenes, of the lead character in her home, the movie shows her the same way that brothel does, and - strangely - she pictures herself later with the same image in her own dreamy battles! So, what was the point?! In my most objective states, I'll say that maybe while the movie sees that some girls are born as already dolls, it uncovers that they can think, plan, and choose the moral choice. Still, something was uneasy about showing the heroine, rather all the girly cast, as dolls, for the entire time; as if it's ALL a wet dream in the brain of the movie's manly makers!<br/><br/>On the positive side, the performance was sane, and somehow convincing. Browning proves how charismatic she is, how intense she can be, and how expressive she can sing. The fantastic battles were dazzlingly designed, with fresh imagination; it had an Asian legend with giant samurais, a WW2 with zombie Nazis, a middle age European combat with mother dragon, and a Vietnam war with fighting robots. The used songs on the soundtrack were really selective, and creatively arranged. They enhanced the sad sense, and made the movie overall special. The cinematography, along with the editing, did a wonderful job. However, the fault was in a deeper level, putting the whole movie in a cleft stick.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder isn't God's gift to writing scripts. And I'm certain that it eats you how he squeezed 82 million dollar, from Warner Bros., to produce this pet project of his. Because, in the end, Sucker Punch should be named Punch Drunk. It resorts to sophisticated narrative, fabricates expensive loud and unrelated-to-anything action, and does some mistakes, all not for the sake of telling its story, just making it superficially different. So, true that the movie ends up as a tale with a new taste, and a rare chance to watch something else the brainless action made by this insane amount of money, but weaker than many brainless action movies, since these movies sound - in comparison - more solid and thrilling, less alleged and mixed up.<br/><br/>In a word, Snyder loves the action, hates doing it brainlessly, yet here he failed to write his dream of action with brain, moreover, offered a classic wrong way to do it!"

","Our world is convoluted, is this game a metaphor for life? Are dreams metaphors or our god-mode selves? One reviewer suggested watching characters that almost couldn't be hurt was insulting, whereas I saw characters that could do practically anything else the cosmos offers but survive the world we have to put up with ourselves. This film is special, and, I watched it in a non-traditional way because you can only watch something for the first time, once. I have a projector, and I soaked this up over two consecutive midnights. When I stepped outside afterwards, the stars were dancing in the prismatic phase shifts I know from certain ethnobotanical ingredients. ahem'. And I was left wondering just how weird life gets, and where the accelerator pedal was on the daily grinder. Couldn't we just dance with evil so hard it explodes? This film explores realists being dreamers, and rendezvous' being more important than outcomes, not because you win but because you live by doing so.

","This movie really impressed me. And then to say I saw it the first time in an airplane on a very small screen.<br/><br/>Two days later i went to see it in the cinema as it was still screening. It impressed me 1000x more.<br/><br/>You can't go around the (near) originality of the story that the movie is playing in the unconsciousness of the main character Babydoll. Reading most reviews here it's like most people never had an endless nightmare where you can't seem to escape from. These expressions of our deepest fears are masterly shown in this movie.<br/><br/>This movie is in my DVD collection and I'll always treasure it. Depending on your mood you see and experience the movie in a different way, every time again. It's equal to what Dark Side of the Moon of Pink Floyd can do to you.<br/><br/>Even if you are slightly in the mystical genre, you'll love Sucker Punch. If you feel like you didn't appreciate it, it's probably because you didn't scratched the surface enough to see the story behind the story.<br/><br/>About the ending, there are probably as many interpretations as people who have seen the movie.

","Basically ""Sucker Punch"" is an $80+ Million laser light show; projected laser beams set to music (in this case nicely produced by Marius De Vries and Tyler Bates). This type of entertainment was quite popular in the theaters during the 1970's (see ""Freaks and Geeks"") as a psychedelic entertainment (Pink Floyd, ELO, Blue Oyster Cult). Laser light was useful in entertainment because the coherent nature of laser light allows a narrow beam to be produced, so optical scanning can draw patterns and images on walls, ceilings or other surfaces. Reflected beams can be bounced to targeted positions with mirrors to create laser sculptures. Focused minds are held spellbound by the focused and concentrated light rays. With the advent of computer generated special effects, recreational drugs like ecstasy, and polysubstance use (kitty flipping anyone?); the light show has evolved into a feature film form. ""Sucker Punch"" being one of the most ambitious. One segment of the audience connects with this experience and another one does not, then both get on the internet and express disbelief that others are showing so much hate (or love) toward the film. Few find a middle ground as illustrated by the paucity of middle tier votes.<br/><br/>In the case of ""Sucker Punch"", far more were disappointed than were impressed. Much the same reaction occurred with Tim Burton's 2010 laser light show titled ""Alice In Wonderland"". So if you hated that film you would be wise to avoid ""Sucker Punch"". Although liking Burton's film is no guarantee that you will like ""Sucker Punch"", as Burton is a skilled acting for the camera director and there was simply no indication that such a skill set was present during the production phase of ""Sucker Punch"".<br/><br/>At about the 25 minute mark of ""Sucker Punch"" I was beginning to believe that it was something special. In just 25 minutes the film had taken its main character (nicely underplayed by Emily Browning) through three stages of madness. I was expecting this progression (or descent) into madness to continue in the manner of a high budget and surreal homage to Polanski's ""Repulsion"" (1965). That is as a hellbound train that never looks back; with it's heroine's point of view fracturing in a steady progression of more bizarre realities. Unfortunately, ""Sucker Punch's"" train spent itself in those early minutes and spends the remainder of the film disappointingly vacillating between the 2nd and 3rd stages of madness, before mercifully bookending itself with a return to the 1st stage.<br/><br/>The problem is that by its nature a laser light show lacks or struggles with certain cinematic elements; like audience to character identification, sensuality, suspense, and challenge to the imagination (there is nothing to imagine when the fundamental construct is one of visual illustration). Which is fine if you connect with what it brings (in place of these missing elements) to its audience; like off-kilter production design, dazzling special effects, eye-popping action. But it is important for a viewer to be aware of the nature and limitations of this type of entertainment if they are to avoid frustration and disappointment.<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

","Sucker Punch was an amazingly visual experience, so kudos to the art directors and the lovely folk that created the effects. As for the plot and concept of the film, I have watched the movie a few times to analyze and get a deeper understanding of it. <br/><br/>There were aspects of the film that may have lead me to question the girl's insanity. The film begins with the ""theatre"" and institution being rusty and much like an actual mental institution. But as the movie progresses, the film is much more like a club and the people in it also transform into much more appealing costumes. Even Blue Jone's mustache was a giveaway. In the beginning and ending of the film he does not have facial hair or fancy costuming. Is the ""club"" real or is it all in Sweet Pea or Baby Doll's head? We all know Baby Doll's fantasies during her dances are in her head but does her imagination go deeper than that? This is what disappointed me in the film(or perhaps it's just me over analyzing), is that with this attempt at a sort-of-inception-like idea, it could have been a really excellent film if it went deeper. I also demand to know who the re-occurring old man and the young boy is throughout the film in Baby Doll's fantasies and at the end of the film. <br/><br/>Nonetheless it was still enjoyable and worth seeing. If you're into visual effects and beautiful girls this is the film you're after. But don't expect too much of it."

","So: Hack Snyder finally made the movie he always wanted to make. Good for him. I was very much looking forward to it, expecting a stylish CGI-rip-off of Tarantino's ass-kicking in a limitless dream-like fantasy-world inside a dream ... inside a dream. And that's exactly what I got and I was very pleased but then I found out I had watched Inception instead. Then I got around to Mr. Snyder's effort and I really have to say: I feel quite sorry for him and all the geeks and nerds he tried so desperately to please with a script and a movie that borders on criminal negligence for everything original or new. So Snyder wanted to make Brazil but Gilliam beat him to it, he wanted to do Moulin Rouge but an Australian guy was faster and he always dreamed of doing ""Kill Bill"" but even that one had been made a couple of years earlier. Bad luck. But no reason at all to turn those films into a horrible stew and garnish it with gruesome actors or sad has-beens (ok, granted: Scott Glen looks a little bit like David Carradine in Kill Bill and Snyder couldn't get Carradine as Carradine was dead, lucky him) It was like I could predict every line before it was spoken. ""What if we get killed?"" one scantily clad girl asks. ""We are already dead"" I sighed in my head. ""We are already dead"" said another scantily clad girl on the screen. They fall from a great hight and I go: ""Please, god of movies, don't let them land in that crappy anime-style stance, one leg spread out straight, one arm raised high, looking cool to the ground, but, alas, of course they do. They must. Because this movie survives on unoriginality. Why a girl that get's institutionalized for NOT being insane has constant insane fantasies and swaps her mental asylum with a whorehouse from the twenties I will never know. Does that horrible fantasy make the horrible reality more bearable? And that crappy music. The whole film was like one of those bad mix-tapes by guys who don't know anything about music but think they do. Brrr. All the ""cool"" bands but only their worst songs, or those overused in other movies, in horrible updated versions. (Oh yes, Snyder obviously always wanted to make Fight-Club too) I promised to kill myself if I ever had to listen to White Rabbit again, used in a dream-sequence. Luckily I didn't really mean it serious or I would be turf now. And the twist at the end? He nicked that from Gilliam who in turn had nicked it from Ambrose Bierce. And everybody saw that coming, even my wife. At the latest when Glen said ominously ""The fifth thing you must find out for yourself. Only you will know!"" The fifth secret ingredient that Snyder misses (as a script-writer at last) is talent, sadly..."

","I think the reviews focus too much on the film being targeted at male audiences only due to the overwhelming presence of beautiful young girls in their twenties. It is true, but it is the visual effect ""orgy"" that really steals the show.<br/><br/>The plot is very simple: a young girl is sent to a medical facility after confronting her stepfather in a violent way at home - she realizes the institution will be the end of her, therefore she immediately decides to come up with a plan in order to escape; which of course involves becoming friends with the rest of the girls inside the facility.<br/><br/>All the fantasy scenes we see - that comprise ""zombie"" Nazis, dragons, giant samurai and so on - are part of an alternative reality she escapes to in order to cope with the system. The battles are getting greater and greater; we can really feel the tension building up as well as how desperately she wants to escape.<br/><br/>Now, this is yet another Zack Snyder film (the director of 300) that focuses solely on the action. Well, I believe he also wished to make us see the development of the girls' relationship with one another, but it all just gets lost in the maze of computer generated images.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is a 110-minute ride that comes to an abrupt stop.

","Guns, explosions, fight scenes and women looking like they had just stepped off the 'I Want to be a Super Model' set - wearing less than what would be useful in battle, was great, but not what made me like this movie. I watched with awe as the story unfolded into a three layered level of reality and fantasy where a girl was so distraught by her consequences that her mind shattered into separate pieces, each of them being an entertaining view on how she dealt with difficult situations. The first thought that came to my mind as I watched the first 30 mins: I wish I could write something like this! It was spectacular in the way it told a simple short-story giving life to the inner workings of a petrified, but strong girl's mind. If you were tripped up and couldn't follow Inception, then you won't follow this. It is absurd to the extreme; following the broken mind through three very different realities. Not a movie for everyone, but certainly a movie for a person that can see past the CGI, the simple but complete plot, good to adequate acting/characters, and watch how the mind of someone can create a separate reality inside of another created reality."

Little girl is a poor victim that no one understands or bothers to help and is utterly helpless. But no, she is an ultra super bad-ass that is invincible with mad ninja fighting skills. But she's special, and attractive, a unique snowflake, so no explanation is necessary. I get the swaps between ""reality"" and fantasy, but they make no sense.

One slow-mo back-flip dragged to two full minutes equals sudden defeat for no reason. I don't know what the f**k I'm trying to say, but I make a hell of a lot more sense than Sucker Punch.

","I usually tend to shy away from movies that are based on graphic novels and comic books because they tend to only appeal to a niche audience. It seems that those people who have seen this movie either passionately love it or they despise it. There does not seem to be any middle ground on the subject. However, after reading many mixed reviews on the film, I decided to invest some time into viewing this film in order to make up my own mind. Long story short, I absolutely loved it.<br/><br/>The movie is centered around the main character, Baby Doll (played by Emily Browning), being institutionalized by her abusive step father into an insane asylum. While in the asylum, Baby Doll teams up with Sweet Pea (Abby Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), and Amber (Jamie Chung) to develop an escape plan. Each stage of the escape plan is lived out through an alternate reality. Each stage is played out through extremely intense battle scenes. After some surprise deaths, it seems Sweet Pea is the only one of the group to make it out of the asylum. Depending on your interpretation of the film, the ending may or may not be a surprise to you. This is a film that I probably want to view several more times before deciding on my concrete interpretation of the story.<br/><br/>The casting is excellent. With the exception of Hudgens, I was not familiar with any of the other young women's work. This is what made the movie work for me. To me, these actresses were unknowns and that fact helped me to view their characters as real people. Also, I must note that Zack Snyder's work as a director was amazing. I did not care much for his previous film, Watchmen yet; this movie killed every expectation that I had. The special effects end of the movie was handled in an amazing way. The blu-ray port of the movie gives the viewer an amazing view for the battle scenes as well as the best surround sound I have experienced outside of a theater. You will almost feel every action of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a great movie.

","The story of a teenage girl who gets institutionalized by her abusive stepfather and retreats into an alternate universe.. a fantasy world.. to cope with the recent events in her life and upon doing so envisions a plan that will help her and some of the other girls escape the mental institution didn't exactly get me too interested in the film; nor did the trailer. My mindset on the film also started to sway rather negatively upon the films release when all I heard was negative feedback.<br/><br/>However, I try not to listen to the critics and just see the film myself to properly assess the material. I decided to await the movie's DVD release and finally sat down to watch it recently. I hoped for only the best because I'm a big Zack Snyder fan. He is responsible for writing and directing some of the most visually striking and masterfully crafted film adaptations, i.e.: 300, Watchmen and Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole. I began to worry, though, when I found the stylized action sequences in this film to be dull.<br/><br/>To me, everything just felt like it was so quickly thrown together. The CGI was very messy, as if it were rushed, only the close-ups seemed to pay particular attention to detail, and the writing was, for lack of a nicer term, horrid. There was little story or character development, just harsh, dark scenes set in reality with glimpses of a corrupt and action-packed parallel universe. The casting was also very off as only Jena Malone managed to deliver a good and believable performance, but I guess not much is to be expected from a film starring Vanessa Hudgens.<br/><br/>Aside from Jena Malone, the only other thing I truly enjoyed about the film was the fact that it was a showcase for some magnificent cinematography. For me it felt like that was Snyder's main focus, rather than to tell the story, was just to please his audience visually. And yes, my eyes were entertained, but as a movie lover who also needs to have all the other elements in a film (good writing, casting and a decent storyline), I was not so pleased."

","So, let's get something straight. I think Zack Snyder is a brilliant director. His incredibly stylistic vision he employs in his films is astounding and brutally incredible. Thus, anything I say in this review should not reflect poor opinions of Mr. Snyder, because he is a fantastic director. Despite anything that is wrong with his new film, Sucker Punch, Snyder still does an incredible job on the visuals and I would go as far as to call this film an aesthetic masterpiece. With that said, Sucker Punch is about a girl who is admitted to an insane asylum by her stepfather. The asylum, however, is just a facade for a whorehouse, and our protagonist finds herself amongst a lot of troubled young girls who want to escape from this evil place. In order to do so they go into the recesses of their minds to find the items they need in order to make their escape. It's trip. It's bizarre. It's rocky at points, but it is overall really cool.<br/><br/>The film opens with one of the coolest and most fantastically well put together opening sequences I've seen in a long time, something I've come to expect with Zack Snyder films. This sequence sets the bleak, yet highly stylized tone for the entire movie. After this initial setup the films story begins and we continue to get a feel for this moody and aesthetic atmosphere we are in. Then we have the first scene where Baby Doll, the protagonist, escapes into her mind for the first time and must fight three giant robot samurai warriors. And yes, it is as awesome as it sounds. This first true action scene made me realize just what I was in for and how visually incredible, if nothing else, this movie would be.<br/><br/>The movie continues to swap between real life and these, I guess you could technically call them, dream sequences. And each atmospheric action packed dream builds upon the previous, getting more and more intense. Snyder never lets up on the very specific, heavily stylized action, and it never gets old. I always commend a director when he delivers to me an adrenaline fueled action scene where I can actually tell whats going on. Snyder does this very successfully and rather than employing the shaky cam and loads of obnoxiously quick cuts Snyder plays out his action with lots of long shots and lots of slow-mo. After a little while I thought I would be terribly fed up with the slow-mo by the end of this film, but some how I wasn't. Like I said, everything that Snyder does with this camera and the amount of ingenious style he pumps this film with makes it all worth it, and it never gets old.<br/><br/>But of course when you have a movie with such strong visuals like these, there has to something wrong somewhere else. And there is. There really is. The story has a very cool concept behind it and can be considered very existential and psychologically deep, but the film doesn't go as far as I would have liked. Some things pan out weaker than expected and a lot could have been done to improve the flow of the story. The film does end well and it will definitely leave you thinking and wondering, what did I just experience? But the two biggest and most glaring issues this film has are its weak and placid characters, and its awful dialog. The dialog between characters isn't necessarily cheesy or corny, it was just so ridiculously one dimensional, with no kick, no air, no mood to it. It was completely flat, dull, and lifeless, just like the characters on screen who could have been a lot more interesting with the backgrounds some of them are given.<br/><br/>The acting is also pretty dreadful in this film. All the main actresses are, albeit gorgeous, very dull. This could definitely be because they had nothing to work with in terms of a script, but even the very few scenes that had some acting potential went nowhere for me and struck no emotional chord with me, no matter how hard it tried. For once I was actually happy that a film kept its dialog to a minimum because normally the dialog will be my favorite aspect of a film. But if Sucker Punch had spent any more time trying to develop these dead characters I wouldn't have ended up liking it as much, if at all. But thankfully this movie knows what it is capable of. It knows what it is here for and it knows what its audience wants. We want hot, scantily clad girls with giant guns and swords blowing stuff up for our own amusement. And we are given just that.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is not at all a bad film. It is incredibly flawed, but there is just no way I could bring myself to dislike a film with such mind boggling visuals that had the adrenaline pumping through me at probably dangerous rates. I don't think I could hate this movie no matter how hard I try. It is just too awesome to dislike and it really does tell a neat story, you just kind of have to wade through a lot of dull characters and dreadful dialog to find it. Zack Snyder once again proves himself to be a modern day auteur, even if that is all Sucker Punch really has going for it."

","This film left me in confusion. I did not get the point. It is enjoyable overall, reminiscent of Sin City or Bitch Slap, but it seems to hint at an additional philosophical layer that I simply could not pin down.<br/><br/>The men in the film are almost exclusively bastards, apart from a single father figure type. Both him and the voice-over (from first person perspective) seem to suggest you need to take some risks to truly be alive, but this does not seem to gel with the start of the film.<br/><br/>In short, this film requires me to consider something, but I just do not understand what. If only Dutch education on Literature had been a little more adolescent-friendly, I probably would have got it right away."

","A lot of people didn't enjoy this movie because of the plot line, and i do agree because the plot did jump all over the place. But if it wasn't for that you wouldn't have the the most visually amazing and intense action sequences you have ever seen. The plot changes are actually advantages to the movie because it adds to the girl's sanity.<br/><br/>After seeing 'Shutter Island' and others i thought this movie would have a similar twist at the end, and unfortunately I was wrong. There was no twist at the end (Don't worry that isn't a spoiler because this movie isn't supposed to have a twist). But this movie defiantly delivers in several different ways - amazing visual effects, insane action sequences, hot girls, and good story line (even though there are two going on at once). This movie is also DEFIANTLY a GUY movie! Not to say that girls wont enjoy it, if you are a girl and you like action movies you will enjoy this also. 'Sucker Punch' keeps you on the edge of your seat and wanting to know what will happen next!"
"KineticSeoul","6","1","3","4 May 2011"," Ultimate geek fantasy, but with some flaws
","I felt a like I sorta got sucker punched after watching this movie in theater. The trailer really hyped me up for this movie, it just had the elements I would really enjoy watching on the big screen. And to some degree it does, but the film has a lot of flaws. The video game/graphic novel style visuals and a bit of eye candy are the elements that is the main attraction for this flick. It seemed like Zack Snyder just thought up a bunch of cool sci-fi/fantasy ideas and tried to cram it in one movie, but without it being engaging or having a good connection. What I mean by good connection, is that reality and sci-fi/fantasy worlds does not connect together in a manner that makes sense. It almost makes no sense at all at times and just throws the audience off. The cast of girls in this is alright, but they are mainly there as eye candy but I ain't complaining. The CGI action sequences are well done and is very entertaining to watch. But when the characters enter back to reality everything gets dull, no matter how much emotion they try to pour out on screen. The plot just wasn't engaging or made me care for the characters all that much since there is hardly any development. And like I said some areas in the plot didn't make any sense because the connection between reality and sci-fi fantasy worlds is very thin. What it comes down to is hot girls kicking ass in geek fantasy worlds in a slick and stylish manner with some cool special effects. That is why I am giving this flick a 6.6, although it might be slightly unfair because the film overall isn't very well crafted. But the cool elements somewhat outweighs the negative in this, sort of.<br/><br/>6.6/10"
"Left-Handed_Liz","7","1","3","26 April 2011"," ""Where is my mind?""
","It's been three weeks, and I still don't know what to think. There is a kernel of truth in this film, but it's buried deep beneath what seems like a lot of nonsense. The wisdom of the opening and closing narration and the enigmatic Wise Man's one-liners are misplaced, eclipsed by generic video game-style action sequences and the heroines'exploited beauty. <br/><br/>Sucker Punch, like its female protagonists, struggles to do better and have a voice among the distracting, head-scratching elements that make up a majority of the movie. It's an action movie with a message- several messages- about escapism, sexuality, and turning weaknesses into strengths, but where they are to be found is different for everyone. The characters are flat, but they don't need to be their own people- they are like figures in a dream, in an allegory, and their virtues (courage, wholeness, loyalty) and their vices (lust, cowardice, betrayal) are universal. <br/><br/>I would love to see Sucker Punch as a book, or a graphic novel. I would love to see what was left on the cutting-room floor for it to earn a (pointless) PG-13 rating. But at its best, it's a stunning synchronization of visual and audio, a true music video movie, with a little bizarre philosophy on top, like oil in water. It's destined to be watched late at night over and over again, dissected and discussed, until the viewer finds something deep and meaningful, or a load of garbage."
"rogerdarlington","Null","1","3","6 April 2011"," Mindless plot but stunning visuals
","Director Zack Snyder is noted for putting his visuals way ahead of any narrative, but I enjoyed both ""300"" and ""Watchmen"". Here though, where he is both writer and director, the visuals totally dominate - yet what visuals. From the very opening to the very closing (the credits themselves are stylish), ""Sucker Punch"" is visually stunning and I saw the film on the biggest screen in Britain (the BFI IMAX in central London). The effects are fabulous and the soundtrack thumping.<br/><br/>In a sense, all art is derivative (after 3,000 years of civilisation, how could it be otherwise?), but this movie is utterly, utterly derivative. Set in a mental institution with one world within another, involving a group of young, attractive women being sent on various missions by an older man, and with four set-piece battles on various mythical locations, this is ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" via ""Inception"" and ""Charlie's Angels"" for the pop video/computer gamer generation.<br/><br/>The central character - and the only one with any real back-story - is Babydoll (5' 2"" Emily Browning) who is a cross between The Bride in ""Kill Bill"" and Trinity in ""The Matrix"". Her four fellow inmates and combatants are sisters Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish - who looks like a young Nicole Kidman) and Rocket (Jena Malone - who looks like a young Meg Ryan) plus Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung). All of them have huge false eyelashes and incredible resource, both physical and hardware. If they are the angels, then the Charlie figure is grizzled Scott Glenn, the only man who is less than revolting. As for the other 'characters', you've got samurai, dragons, cyborgs, robots, the lot - all waiting to be blasted to bits in a fast-moving video world.<br/><br/>If there had been a half-decent script with some sort of plot, this would have been quite a movie. As it is, you need to give yourself a virtual lobotomy and just enjoy the ride."
"LazySod","7","1","3","5 April 2011"," Seriously off-kilter, but tasty
","The story to this film is easy enough: a young girl with more baggage than she is supposed to have at her age is committed to a mental asylum. Instead of being helped to deal with her baggage she's being tormented even further - which makes her search for other ways of escape.<br/><br/>The implementation of this story is a short introduction which gives more than enough insight into the backing of the characters and the location - and then an overly large dose of eye candy that alternates between reality and fantasy. This alternation works well - it gives a nicely balanced rhythm of high and low pace scenes and all of them are worked out artfully right.<br/><br/>The film does feel a tiny bit fractured though and the ending isn't entirely pleasing or even fitting. This isn't due to the acting - which is good enough in general, but is purely due to the chosen story line. It doesn't make the film bad - it's eye candy and nothing but eye candy after all, but it could have been better.<br/><br/>So, all in all, maximum visuals, more than OK sound track, highly entertaining and sometimes even art-house but forgotten the moment the cinema is left behind.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 unreal realities."

"jayjaycee","5","1","4","11 February 2020"," ""One flew over the matrix"" - nice summary, but not as brilliant
","""Sucker Punch"" is a fantasy action film directed by Zack Snyder starring Emily Browning and Abbie Cornish. There are not many directors in the business who are despised by some and simultaneously praised as a genius by others. Before he became sort of the ""godfather"" of the DCEU he established himself as someone who knew to entertain with mindless fun flicks and mediocre remakes of horror classics, such as ""300"" or ""Dawn Of The Dead"" and this reputation is palpable in this production as well. With each and every film of his filmography it's either hit or miss, hot or not, you either love it deeply or absolutely hate it. I have mixed feelings with this one. By all means, it's definitely not a great film, but I'm surprised that it had the right ingredients to become so good and a well made action flick, the premise is extremely interesting, but well, what am I to say? It's a Snyder film in the end. I'm having the feeling that his personal motto concerning film making is ""style over substance"" and I think that's the quintessence of it all. It's his eccentric directorial style that results in stunning visuals and stylish colours, but it's not making up for the basically nonexistent plot and storytelling. A phenomenal cast that consists of both excellent actors and promising newcomers plays a bunch of shallow and forgettable characters that really could have been fleshed out more. The only performance that exceeds the hurdle of mediocrity is Oscar Issac's. He surely made the best out of his messy lines. Furthermore, I'd consider myself as someone who's able to shut off his brain and enjoy some good action, but even though ZS aimed to create this, I'm surprisingly disappointed that he even failed to reach this goal. The over the top action sequences are basically nothing more than generic choreographies in slow motion, mostly filmed from unusual and experimental camera angles. When an action film doesn't succeed to entertain me and makes me prefer the quiet sequence between them, you know what's going on. At least there was a brilliant choice of songs for the soundtrack that thoroughly fit the atmosphere of the film. Next to subliminal antifeminist tendencies (believe me, it desperately tries to be the opposite, but in the end it fails to do so) and excessively sexualized female protagonists, it also has a lot of average CGI effects in it. Don't get me wrong, the leading ladies all are bombshells (especially Vanessa Hudgens. You know, childhood crush), but I think that the screenplay doesn't treat them with enough respect and basically reduces them to the role of just looking sexy while playing out what appears to be a male fantasy. Also, was that in the end supposed to be a plot twist? Within the first three minutes I saw through the dilletant attempt of a compelling three-layer plotline. The only thing in it that amazed me was the message behind the almost totally hidden metaphor that the only one who's able to overcome mental illness is oneself. This uplifting aspect made me feel good. But that's it. All in all, this genre mix tries to cheat on the audience by simply looking stunning and wants you to ignore the disastrous plot, shallow characters and boring story. It had endless possibilities to be something greater, but Snyder decided to live out his messy style instead and ruin a promising premise. Once again, he proved that the only one standing in his way is himself. It's such a pity, really."
"CriticalRaccoon","3","1","4","18 January 2020"," Ambitious, but incredibly flawed and messy
","I hesitate to say that Sucker Punch is a terrible film ... but man does it feel like one.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is the rare non-adaption from director/writer Zack Snyder that showcases his visionary talent while also highlighting all of his worst habits.<br/><br/>Pretty film with creative action scenes? Yes!<br/><br/>Bad plot, character development, pacing, etc? Yes!<br/><br/>Switch out Snyder for a better director and Sucker Punch might have been a radical vision of trauma, escapism and gender roles on par with Pan's Labyrinth - a film that tackles similar themes but is done far better in almost every single way, and one I feel Snyder was heavily inspired by. I admire Snyder's ambitions a lot, I just question the execution.<br/><br/>For the record I'm only talking of the theatrical cut, not the extended cut or the recently announced ""Snyder Cut.""<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is the 1960s tale of Babydoll (Emily Browning), a young lady who is put into an insane asylum by her evil stepfather after she gets blamed for the death of her sister. The father pays an orderly named Blue (Oscar Isaac) to forge documents to get her lobotomized at the ""orders"" of the chief psychiatrist (Carla Gugino) as she's the sole witness to her sister's death at his hands, as well as the sole beneficiary of her recently deceased mother's will (it's the 1960's, lobotomizing young girls was a lot easier back then). When this is about to happen Babydoll starts to fantasize that she's in a brothel run by Blue and has several other of the asylum members in the dream as sex slave dancers (Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, Jamie Chung) and plans to escape her captivity. So they devise a plan to steal items to help them escape, as Babydoll uses her mesmerizing dance skills to distract people ... which is interpreted on screen as another fantasy which involves stuff like dragons, steampunk nazi zombies, gigantic magic samurai armor creatures ... I need a drink.<br/><br/>Okay, so the first thing that stands out about this film is that while I watched it is I had literally zero investment in the fantasy plots - you know, the entire selling point of the film and the reason a studio put money into it. We know that in reality Babydoll is a second away from getting a lobotomy, so what's the interest in seeing the last dream of someone who's about to suffer a cruel fate? Heck the reality part lasts all of 10 minutes at most, with the vast majority of the runtime spent on a hallucination. The dream story itself might have worked okay without the framing narrative, but it's too many layers that don't matter.<br/><br/>This lack of weight to the, admittedly, wonderfully choreographed action setpieces does bring the whole of the film down. All the fantasies relate in some way to the theft of the items that Babydoll and company will need to ""escape"" but their own logic fails. For example: stealing magic crystals from a dragon in an orc-filled castle equates to pick pocketing a lighter. We know that whatever happens against the dragon means nothing and affects nothing, it's merely an overlong romanticized visual of a mundane act. Did Snyder just come up with a series of disconnected action scenes that he had to somehow build a story around? I have no idea, but he did somehow make steampunk nazi zombies fighting a giant mech and 5 young girls dressed more to titillate than protect somehow be boring.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is also very messy with its message. A lot has been written about the way this film treats its female stars; it's either a sexist tale of men oppressing women while being a faux-feminist action-fest meant for horny teenage boys, or a story of female empowerment against the male forces that hold them down. Oh, and the film features girls kicking ass in a fantasy when in reality they are being abused over and over again (rape, sexual assault, murder, etc). Yay for imaginary empowerment?<br/><br/>I honestly don't know how to deal with Sucker Punch's dismal delivery of themes. Does Sucker Punch use sexist images to subvert those very same sexist images? Can a film that checks all the boxes of being sexist not be sexist because it was being sexist on purpose to show how sexist the world is? All I know is Snyder doesn't have the best reputation in regards to how he features female characters, and Sucker Punch does sort of fit that mold.<br/><br/>With all this messy, boring, and borderline offensive material I can still see how some people have come to love Sucker Punch. The ""attempt"" at delivering a message is noble - albeit heavily flawed. The film does feature Snyder's trademark ability to direct a stylish action scene like few can; these are scenes that are completely unique and creatively done by a man who built a career off his eye for action. The concept itself is interesting even if it borrows from far superior sources. Sucker Punch does have some good things in it, they are just buried under a lot of mess.<br/><br/>There was clearly passion put into Sucker Punch; passion that doesn't always end in great results. It seems all involved were heavily invested in the project and wanted it to succeed; it's failure made more tragic for those who didn't realize the flaws in its design. Sucker Punch is a boring, messy, convoluted, and at times unpleasant piece of cinema with failed aspirations to be something so much more. Had Snyder not fallen yet again into the traps of his works he might have come up with a modern masterpiece of surreal images conveying a deeper, disturbing look at society. Sucker Punch is the cinematic equal of going to a fine art gallery that reeks of rotting food, has a leaky roof, and you have to wade through sewage on the way out.<br/><br/>With better direction and a more refined vision Sucker Punch could have been miraculous. As it stands it's nothing more than a failed attempt at auteur cinema from a director that's own bad habits got in his way."

","There are a lot of ways to describe this flick: surreal grindhouse, Gothic music video, video game movie, prison girl film, Heavy Metal meets LOTR etc. The movie for the most part was 5 stars. I didn't like the ending as they attempted to make a statement when none was needed. Baby Doll's mother dies. The step-dad was left out of the will so he kills Baby doll's sister and blames her during a goth version of ""Sweet Dreams"" (Annie Lennox). Baby Doll is committed to the Lennox asylum in Brattleboro, Vt. She is supposed to get a lobotomy in 5 days, during which she plans an escape.<br/><br/>The asylum has a stage where the girls perform. Baby Doll has a dance which mesmerizes people, a dance, we the audience never get to see. While Baby Doll dances she goes into a trance or dream world where she imagines she is battling all kinds of creatures (zombies, orcs etc). This is all done to a great soundtrack and computer graphics. In this aspect, the movie reminded me of ""Heavy Metal"", a series of stories loosely connected by a plot. This actually works well, unfortunately when the movie deviates from it, it doesn't work at all. During the first dance Baby Doll is told to get certain objects so she can escape. During her subsequent dances she entrances the males in the audience while her fellow inmates steal the item they need. The item they steal relates to the surreal imagination of Baby Doll.<br/><br/>No nudity, no sex, and the language was acceptable. Girls run around in short skirts with tight black hip boots. This is this generation's ""Heavy Metal"" movie, one that would be best watched on the big screen at a midnight showing"
"tomimt","5","1","4","30 November 2013"," Visually interesting music video
","Sucker Punch is a visually interesting, but structurally flawed music video masked as a motion picture. It has a very light story about a young girl who's been abused by her father and then sent to mental hospital by him so that he could hide his sins. And while the young girl is there, she escapes to wild fantasies, while planning her escape, that make the movie look like its content was collected from several different video games ranging from fantasy feudal Japan to anime inspired sci-fi.<br/><br/>And that's the problem with this movie. Znyder could have probably make Sucker Punch a better movie if he'd just had chosen a specific fantasy element to co-exist with the asylum reality, but now the movie is done in such a manner, that the fantasy elements feel too fragmented, despite many of them have bits in them that will most likely make you say ""Well that's neat."" In the end though, simply filling the movie with neat scenes rarely is enough to make the movie an actually good piece. You can't deny Znyders keen visual eye and while movies are a visual medium, visuals are not always enough."

","This was movie was a doozy to rate as I was in a fix as to which aspects offered the stars. Yes, there was a grand effort to make a USP of this movie the titillation factor given by the actresses. With a different way of capturing the story expressed, this movie excelled in being unique. The efficacy of graphics and action sequences would have made this movie an excellent one except the unfortunate aspect of- women. To be clear, it is not because the women are participating in the action, but rather are dressed as they are and attack as they do. One borders along the line of wondering whether to be 'turned on' or enjoy the action. Indeed, for those who cherish a woman who can fight, this movie is on to adore, but for people more of my liking this was a blunder. Suckerpunch offers a new way of looking at a story, but confuses the viewer on many levels. Although it may be apparent what is being headed towards, this movie strikes up many questions, for example, why are we watching this/ what is the message trying to be expressed/ what can be learned? Note: It is not that movies cannot be meant for time-pass, but it feels very different to most movies. Watch it if you must, but do not except to be mind-blown as more of a journey is considered as opposed to twists and turns along a straight path to the climax like most movies."
"freemantle_uk","4","1","4","21 January 2012"," A Collection of Music Videos
","Before I start this review I want to say I am a fan of Zack Snyder's directional style and I find that Dawn of the Dead a great example of how to do a remake and 300 to be a really entertaining action film. But sadly Sucker Punch found to be a flaw work.<br/><br/>""Babydoll"" (Emily Browning) is a young woman who after her mother dies is sent to a Mental Hospital when she accidentally kills her sister when trying to defence her from their step-father (Gerard Plunkett). In the hospital Babydoll is scheduled to have a lobotomy in five days. She has to escape before them. Blue (Oscar Isaac) secretly runs the hospital as a brothel with the girls performing erotic dances for high playing clinics. Babydoll befriends the girls, Rocket (Jena Malone), Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Amber (Jamie Chung) and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) to get the five items they need to escape and as Babydoll dances she escapes into a world of fantasy.<br/><br/>Snyder has a great visual style and he deserves to be an in demand director. He is one of the best action directors around, he sticks to his guns and I am still looking for to see what he does with The Man of Steel. There are some impressive action sequences in the Sucker Punch, the highlights being the sequence against the German World War One Zombies and against the mechanic robots. They are what Snyder does best, close action scenes, great camera movements and slow motion as well brutal (or as brutal as they can be for 12/PG-13 film) scenes with steam power zombies getting shot and stabbed. But it felt like Snyder was holding back and that Sucker Punch should have been 15/R rated film, with blood, gore and full on violence. Some elements like the sequence in the castle felt like it was borrowing from Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings because the orcs looked the same. As well because the action sequences take place in the mind of Babydoll so they do not have any real impact on actual events of the film and music plays throughout them, making them seems more like music videos then being part of the film. Sucker Punch starts with a montage which is basically a music video and then there was a montage of Babydoll's life is again more like a music video. Babydoll hardly speaks for the first 20 minutes of the film.<br/><br/>The acting throughout Sucker Punch is decent enough. I generally like Browning and I hope she has a long career but her character was at times little too meek and quiet. Isaac did have a real sinister edge to his character and he was a scary figure to the girls. But Carla Gugino spoke in an really exaggerated Russian accent that did get a bit annoying.<br/><br/>As a film Sucker Punch does have some of the worst examples of fanboy/gaming culture. The first fantasy sequence sees Babydoll fighting three big samurai monsters and she is dressed throughout in a Japanese schoolgirl outfit. Some critics have complained that Sucker Punch is a sexist, leering at women in sexualised outfits whilst others say it that is empowering because they wore their outfits with authority and there is of course a feminist theory that woman should take back these outfits and woman should embrace these sexuality. I personally do not think it meant to be sexist but it does play into a fanboy fantasy that they want a woman to be a kick-ass hero but wants them to be hot whilst they do it.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is a disappointment for Snyder fans. It is just a film that is a load of good imagines but not substance behind them."
"vincent-bullock","10","1","4","13 September 2011"," A very complex and demanding film
","When I saw the trailer for Sucker Punch I just knew Zack Snyder had something hidden up his sleeve. The film seemed to be an action-fest with hot, young girls in short skirts. It seemed degrading to say the least and that's why it left me so intrigued. Zack Snyder didn't fail to amaze me as usual and presented me with one of the best films I've seen this year.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch has many layers in both a real and a metaphorical sense. It starts as a film about a young girl sent to an insane asylum to be disposed of, suddenly that was all a strange dream sequence and we have the same girl being sold to a brothel and yet again we're sent into another alternate fantasy land where she is fighting dragons and steam-punk Nazis. The exact meaning of all this is hard to grasp but it certainly kept me thinking about it hours after watching it. That's when the genius behind it began to surface. Fantasy. It's all a huge, incongruous fantasy.<br/><br/>The ending should have caught anybody paying attention by surprise. It's quite a twist and there seems to be no point to it, however the futility of the ending is the whole point.<br/><br/>If you watched the trailer you should have imagined a story about young women struggling against an oppressive society with their weapons being their fists and their attractive physiques. You don't have to be a woman to understand how offensive this can be as a representation of the feminist movement. That's part of the point.<br/><br/>So you have the hot girls, the guns, the cruel sexist oppressors and the skimpy outfits. What's left? Obviously a lot of violence and fan-service along the way to victory. But do they succeed? *SPOILER* Of course not, they all die which is perfectly logical given that they are a bunch of teenage girls trying to fight their way out of a jail guarded by brutish, burly men.<br/><br/>This film served as a great wake up call to writers everywhere. A large percentage of the audience is tired of this pseudo-feminist, sexploitation garbage. If you want to write films where women succeed it's better if you start by writing about realistic women who achieve their goals with believable means. We don't want films about ninjas who happen to have nice legs. How are you supposed to look up and admire that? Those girls aren't even human. They're just idealized puppets of a writer's imagination. You want an example of a action woman you can look up to? How about Sarah Connor? How about Ellen Ripley? What's that? Oh, they haven't got the cute outfits or the pantyshots, I forgot about that."

","Recently I re-watched Sucker punch and finally wound up not having a problem with the movie. Though at times the actions scenes over excite the actual intentions of the movie.So here it goes-------- First scene: In the first scene I realized the full intentions were about an abused daughter (Baby doll), sent to an mental house after evil deeds of the father. Later we see revenge is place upon the evil but was failed. Second scene: she gets sent to the mental house where we find its a front then the adventure begins with her three days that she has left. That is before she gets her lobotomized. Third scene: They finally see an opening to leave but because baby doll is the key to end all wrong doings.She suffers the consequences as she finally becomes lobotomized, but authority steps in and stops all this then closes the place with illegal activities that occurs. There is no problem with the thought that Zack imagined to make the film work, just that reality and imagination gets clouded at times making the movie hard to enjoy. Though I do see how He uses mental flotations to make action segments with the satisfaction of Baby doll getting justice. The action is well played out but at times it just wasn't well thought out."

The music is cool as well, it gives the film more character, and augments the intensity of action scenes. The plot makes little sense though, and characters are poorly developed. It feels as if the characters are there solely for the sake of fighting, so that the filmmakers can make a film with loads of cool scenes.<br/><br/>Even though ""Sucker Punch"" is a forgettable film, it is still an entertaining film if you keep your brain turned off."
"alexamose","5","1","4","5 September 2011"," Fun, but has a lot of flaws
","This was a movie I had wanted to see for a long time. Sadly, I never got the chance to see it in theaters. Then I started hearing some of the reviews, and they quickly lowered my expectations. Now that I've seen it, and can honestly say that this movie is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. I'll tell you why.<br/><br/>Let's start with the positives. It perfectly delivers what it promises to the target demographic. Hot girls fighting monsters in another world. The action scenes are pretty fun for the most part, though they can get boring at times. The special effects are hit and miss for me. Sometimes, they're absolutely stunning, while other times it looks like a video game. And that's what this movie is. A video game---played by an extremely skilled gamer, at that. My main gripe is that the characters come off as invincible, and it doesn't change until the very end when some of them die---not giving any names here.<br/><br/>The characters, for the most part, did what they needed to do. I would've liked to see them develop a little more and get a little back story. Two characters get a little bit, the main character gets a lot at the beginning, and the other two are left hanging. Speaking of the main character, they just kinda glossed over her back story in the beginning so I had a hard time emphasizing with her. The other two girls that got a little bit of back story and some mediocre chemistry here and there were the ones that I really cared about. The other two were just there---and just so you know, I hated Vanessa Hudgens in this movie, but then again, I don't like her in real life so I guess I'm being unfair. The acting was good for the most part. Nothing award winning, but decent for the genre.<br/><br/>I mostly had an issue with the story. It's nothing to complicated: some girls in a mental institution trying to break free by obtaining certain items. However, they throw in these dream sequences that were full of Zack Snyder action scenes, cgi, and slow motion. I was rather confused by this. They're just trying to get items, yet for some reason, whenever the main character dances, she goes into another world where they get the items as a group; and fight different creatures as they go along. This world was never established as part of the story, it just appears. Sure, they're fun to watch, but are mostly pointless and make no sense.<br/><br/>Overall, Sucker Punch was a hit or miss film for me. It's now a guilty pleasure of mine.<br/><br/>I'd give it a C or C-"
"MikeCohodes","4","1","4","1 September 2011"," What's the point?
","Sucker Punch takes place all within the mind of a woman sent to a mental ward. In fact, the sequences in the film are a fantasy within a fantasy in the mind of Emily Browning, called Babydoll in the movie. It's like Inception, only sucky. Joining her within her fantasy world are Abbie Cornish (Sweat Pea), Jena Malone (Rocket), Vanessa Hudgens (Blondie â€“ a weird choice given that she's nowhere near blonde), and Jamie Chung (Amber). The second layer fantasies are the more interesting ones, with the girls fighting giant evil samurai, steampunk Nazi soldiers, slaying a dragon, and much more. Unfortunately, despite all of the visual goodies (and the film is shot beautifully with some really cool effects), the film just lacks any sort of coherency or sense for its plot.<br/><br/>I think the title of the movie refers to how the audience feels after wasting nearly 2 hours of their lives watching this movie, they got sucker punched. An alternative title would be Zack Snyder's Ultimate Fanservice Extravaganza. Dressing up his female stars in schoolgirl outfits right out of Sailor Moon, and having them fight in all sorts of different fantasy settings, feels like something out of a manga universe. He tries to make a film for the fanboys to drool over, but the only drool that emerged from my mouth was when I nearly fell asleep. I usually like Snyder's films also, both 300 and Watchmen, but this one just bothered me for reasons I can't quite pin down. Probably because I was just laughing throughout the film at the absurdity and pointlessness of everything taking place on screen. Don't waste your time on this one."
"lvasa","10","1","4","11 August 2011"," Underrated
","This film is much better than it seems from the ratings. Many complain that it is shallow, but it is just the blindness of the viewer, who cannot see that behind something visually attractive there might be also something rather deep. There is a message in this movie, and although it is a rather simple one, it is still better than message brought by most highly rated movies. Think of it - what's the message of Inception? Don't mess with multi-layered dreams? Is that really what you needed to know?<br/><br/>And if you wish, there's plenty of material to brood about too, it's like a book inversed - when reading a book, you are given all the relations, and you must imagine the visuals, here you are given the visuals, but you have to imagine the relations. <br/><br/>Most interesting."
"Christian_Dimartino","3","1","4","17 July 2011"," The worst film of the year so far.
","The worst film of the year so far is Sucker Punch, a film with the visuals of a Peter Jackson film and the storytelling of a Michael Bay film. Its as if the filmmakers had an idea for it, and lost it once they started filming.<br/><br/>Emily Browning plays a girl who is sent to a mental asylum. But the mental asylum is like a burlesque show or a whore house or something, and when you dance you see a fantasy world where you have to fight dragons and stuff. So, the girls(played by Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, and others) plan their escape, but in order to escape they have to grab five items, and in order to grab the five items they have to go into the fantasy world and retrieve them.<br/><br/>Isn't that confusing or what? I didn't get the movie. Why could they have just stolen them from in the asylum? The items were in the asylum. I'll tell you why. Zack Snyder(300, Watchmen) is trying to win us over with visuals because he doesn't have enough plot to support the film.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch has some cool visuals, but its plot is empty, and actually rather stupid. Why would dancing bring you to a fantasy world? The damn thing just doesn't add up. Maybe if the crew tried, they could've had something fun, but still dumb.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","5","1","4","5 July 2011"," Visual stunner with a story prematurely hatched
","Festering somewhere in the chaos of ""Sucker Punch"" is an exotic narrative twisted into an epic adventure waiting to be born. But Zack Snyder has pulled his bun out of the oven way before he's given it time to rise. <br/><br/>A multi-layered rock fantasy that could find a permanent home on MTV2, Snyder's premature brainchild is a mind**** of a film; literally every fantasy in his mind and that of creative dorks like him (boys and girls included) popped open like a champagne bottle spewing glorious slow-motion foam everywhere at the hands of one not strong enough to control it. Snyder fills his canvas with everything he or we could possibly imagine, but with nothing except visual motifs to tie it all together.<br/><br/>""Sucker Punch"" feels like a personal project Snyder should've kept locked up a little (okay, a lot) longer. Sure, after ""Dawn of the Dead"" and the financial surprise that was ""300,"" he earned himself a creative license with Hollywood dollars long before the few filmmakers who ever earn that kind of power usually do. Snyder, however, jumped at the chance to work on his own story way too soon. Narratively the film is missing connections between a lot of its dots and the characters, while likable, possess zero back story and consequently have no motivation. <br/><br/>To be as brief as possible, after Snyder's music video prologue for a remix of Annie Lennox's ""Sweet Dreams"" that explains how Baby Doll (Emily Browning) got sent to a mental institution thanks to her nasty stepfather, she discovers the hospital appears to be a front for a burlesque show/brothel run by Dr. Gorski (Carla Gugino) and namely the asylum director, Blue (Oscar Isaac). Girls Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Amber (Jamie Chung) and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) are performers, but Baby Doll steals the show as she's found a way through losing herself in dancing to unlock a dream world that can help her and the others escape. This dream world creates fantastical missions again Nazi zombies, giant Samurai, dragons and more that help them get what they need in reality to make their escape.<br/><br/>At times, I truly believed a book adaptation of this story would be perfect. It would allow the time and opportunity to enter the head of Baby Doll as well as her detained friends and give time for Snyder's ideas to germinate. As odd as this sounds, Snyder would've done amazing work with this film had he adapted it from a well-crafted novel that already made sense and didn't leave its audience with fingernails upon scalp. His execution rates better than almost any director with action, but his talent is just that so far: execution (and I don't mean that with morbid sarcasm).<br/><br/>The one cooked-through element of ""Sucker Punch"" is what you'd expect from Snyder: the action. The visuals are jaw-dropping. The only thing missing would be a little gravity or even the slightest bit of logic justifying the bizarre scenes for each dream world escapade. These fight scenes draw inspiration from any movie you could imagine, with one involving a castle, dragons and goblins that strongly echoes ""Lord of the Rings."" The hazy yellow world Snyder has created simply stuns and his style and perspective choices during fight scenes remain impeccable. You can't deny the man his incredible gift in this regard. He also knows how to support his visuals with music. It will be awhile before soundtracked films overtake or at least match composed films in this genre, but Snyder will be viewed as the godfather when it happens.<br/><br/>It's tough to make it through a chaotic and abstract film that doesn't appropriately lay its foundation, so the rip-roaring visuals help. Some moments in the plot are in fact a bit more jarring than expected and elicit more of a reaction than I'd like to give the film credit for, but these talented young actresses help in spite of the hollow cores of the characters they've been handed.<br/><br/>Where foundation and execution flip-flop for ""Sucker Punch"" comes from the creative seed. In that regard, there's a foundation for an film that could be revelatory, but Snyder's focus on the stylishness of the delivery slices it up into vague and incoherent chunks. It can safely be deemed a story championing self-empowerment, but we never feel that because of the seemingly random and abstract ways he dresses it up. Honestly, if Christopher Nolan had this in his brain and could've scripted it, you'd be looking at a hailed cinematic achievement. Snyder just got ahead of himself. Some people will recognize the potential had Snyder waited and really tailored the story perfectly, but most will see the randomness and lack of control.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
"rparham","5","1","4","3 June 2011"," Visuals in search of a reason to be
","It is a bit amusing, when you think about it, that the first film from director Zack Snyder that is not an adaptation of another medium or a remake is easily his worst film to date. The film in question is Sucker Punch, and it is the ultimate embodiment of what people have complained about much of today's cinema: it is a good looking, painstakingly designed and visually realized film that is almost completely hollow at its core.<br/><br/>The plot of Sucker Punch, what there is of one, focuses on Baby Doll (Emily Browning), who has been through some traumatic experiences recently. Her mother has died, leaving her and her sister in the clutches of their abusive and self-absorbed step-father (Does Hollywood ever portray step-fathers any other way?). When an accident claims Baby Doll's sisters' life, the circumstances are made to appear as if Baby Doll did the deed, so her step-father has her committed to a mental hospital where he has arranged for her to be lobotomized in a few days. Once she is incarcerated in the hospital, she imagines her situation in a fantasy environment, where she and her fellow inmates, including Sweet Pea (Abby Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung), are dancers in a strip club run by the malevolent Blue (Oscar Issac) who are forced to perform for customers and Blue plans to deliver Baby Doll into the hands of the High Roller (Jon Hamm) by the end of the week. <br/><br/>To escape this situation, Baby Doll hatches a plan to steal several items they need (a key, a weapon, etc.) from the facility, and to facilitate these thefts without garnering the attention of the staff, Baby Doll distracts the club staff by performing her dancing routine, during which we are shown yet another level of fantasy in which Baby Doll and her compatriots are super-women, capable of all kinds of superhuman abilities in fights, and they are engaged in various ""missions"" in fantasy or science fiction themed environments, ranging from the trenches of World War I manned by zombie creatures with advanced weapons, to a traditional castle that needs to be stormed that also serves as the home of a fire breathing dragon and, finally, futuristic environments set on other worlds. During these sequences, they take their orders from an overseer (Scott Glenn) who provides them clues that relate to their missions in the nightclub world.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, Zack Snyder and his team have managed to assemble a visually arresting film with densely detailed environments that are very well realized. All the films action sequences are set in synthetic worlds that are full of slick, fantastical elements that are indeed gorgeous to look at. The production design team and visual effects artists have gone the extra mile to make Sucker Punch a very good looking production. What is missing, however, is anything above the thinnest of screenplays that is provided as the skeleton to hang the visuals on. Sucker Punch is flat and lifeless, practically boring after a time, because beyond the pretty pictures, there is very little to the story. <br/><br/>One of the film's biggest failings is to enshroud the story in two levels of fantasy, especially the second level that kicks in every time Baby Doll is supposed to be performing her dance routines and we are treated to the action sequences. Because these are complete fantasy, detached from the surrounding narrative, and feature the female characters as indestructible super heroes, with reflexes and skills to rival Superman, we have no emotional investment in these sequences. We don't feel any concern or suspense as to the outcome, because there are no real stakes to them; they are good looking showpieces and that is it, with no real connection to the film at large. When all your characters are indestructible, and you know that everything on the screen is just a fantasy of one of the characters, how can you expect the audience to be invested in what is happening on the screen?<br/><br/>It doesn't help that, in the film's larger story, it suffers from practically no real character development to any of the leads. There are a significant number of attractive, young female actresses in the various main roles, but the people they are supposed to be embodying are almost completely without any investment by the screenplay other than to have them simply move through the motions of the story events. We learn practically nothing about any of them, save for some minor surface detail, so we are not interested or involved in what happens to any of them as the film progresses, for the most part. As it reaches its climax, there is a twinge of empathy for one of the characters, but the emotional payoff is still nowhere what it could be if there was any more depth to these characters than what was necessary to just move the plot forward.<br/><br/>Since there is very little to the characters, the actors do the best they can, but it is mostly for naught. Oscar Issacs, as the captor, Blue, manages to deliver up some over-the-top scenery chewing as the villain, but Cornish and her cohorts could be realized by just about any actress as presented in Sucker Punch, that is how little the film is dependent on most of its characters. The stars of this film are the visuals, not actors.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch does not bode well for Zack Snyder's ability to craft a film from scratch with any degree of story or character beyond the bare minimum needed for him to craft the intricate images that he has obviously decided to focus on in this film. Sucker Punch is impressive to look at, but there is almost absolutely nothing more to it beneath the glossy sheen of its fancy exterior."
"Fenris Fil","4","1","4","1 June 2011"," An exercise in futility
","The problem with this film is that for action to work you need to have an emotional investment in it. But when the action is at best a metaphor to the films reality, there is none. With no emotional investment your not on the edge of your seat and it just becomes pretty pictures.<br/><br/>Sad really because the action itself, when not taken in the context of the film is pretty good and the films main plot is reasonable. It just doesn't work when all put together, the whole is far less then the sum of it's parts. When you start to compare the film to ones that are similar in concept, such as Pans Labyrinth or Brazil, you realise just how much this film falls short.<br/><br/>Sure you could compliment the film for being an action film with some depth but that is to largely miss the point. The basic plot is set up quickly and the rest of the film are the long action sequences filling in the gaps and ultimately serving no purpose. The truth is the two sides work against each other and would be better served in a film of their own."

It doesn't.<br/><br/>The lovely Emily Browning, who doesn't look as lovely as a bleached blonde, plays a girl whose rich mother has died and left her wealth to her two daughters. The stepfather kills the younger girl and frames the older one. Not only that, but he gets her interned in an asylum and pays off the guy in charge to perform a lobotomy on her. Just as the needle is about to hit her eye, we enter into the second level of reality. Here the ill girls are strippers and prostitutes. Emily's Baby Doll bonds with the other girls. Every time she dances she enters a third level of reality. Here she is guided by a guru and given hints on how to escape. They have to collect some items from level 2 in order to get out. While she dances she hypnotizes the audience while the other girls steal the objects needed. The missions in level 3 take the shape of video game like battles. As with video games, the enemies are the Germans, monsters, and alien robots. These battle scenes are pretty good but progressively get worse. The first one is the most amazing, looking like a battle from Call of Duty II. The second one in the middle ages is OK. The third one against robots that look like they came from I-Robot is poor.<br/><br/>Eventually it all has to unravel through the 3 levels of reality. Everything that happens is really an excuse to show us battle scenes. The whole stripper stuff is silly in a PG-13 movie and looks more like some cheesy burlesque music video- and we actually get one of those as the end credits roll.<br/><br/>There is a message in this movie, not unlike the one from The Matrix: free yourself and you are responsible for your destiny. A noble message no doubt. However, the movie doesn't play out the message. The ending us unhappy. It takes courage for filmmakers to go with an unhappy ending. But here it doesn't work with the positive message the movie tries to impart. How can you free yourself when you're lobotomized (the main actress does get lobotomized in the end)? What is the purpose of taking charge of your life if someone else benefits from your actions and not you (another character and not the main one escapes from the institution).<br/><br/>There is an idea here, there is the budget, and skill of the crew and cast, in particular Browning, Cornish, Gugino.

","***this review will contain spoilers***<br/><br/>Well, it's not so often we get one of those surprisingly interesting trailers from a movie that looks totally cool but nobody had heard about until it's almost out. It's like that special treat your mother gave you out of the blue when you were a kid. 9 cases out of 10 the movie turns out to be a disappointment and this one wasn't the lucky 10th.<br/><br/>The plot in short: Girl becomes an orphan (in her 20s WTF?), girl kills younger sister by accident while trying to protect her from evil step-dad, evil step-dad puts girl in mental institution, girl gets a pretty wild hallucinogenic (aka CGI explosionfest) trip while she's trying to escape.<br/><br/>I can't help but feel that by watching this movie I saw two good opportunities go to waste. The main premise, that the protagonist actually has the strength of mind to keep trying to escape the mental hospital even from within her hallucinations could have made, in my opinion, a wonderful psychological thriller. Just throw out all the CGI and actually SHOW us her interaction with the real world, and her interpretation of if through her acid trip. But that would need, what's it called, a script. Oh yeah, and actors. I mean for realz.<br/><br/>On the other hand her hallucination induced dreams, and by that i mean all the CGI action sequences could have made a nice no brainer action flick if they had been stitched together with a plot of their own. And yes I for one find German steampunk zombies fun, dragons, mechanical giant samurai and rejects from I,Robot fun to shoot at. I'm that shallow.<br/><br/>Most of the movie takes place in a hallucination, and all the action takes place during...dancing destructo-dreams? You can't feel for the characters because A) You know that's not the real them, at least not the mental hospital real, and B) THE SCRIPT IS JUST THAT TERRIBAD that they could have gotten away with cardboard cut-outs for most of it.<br/><br/>So pros and cons?<br/><br/>Pros -As I said before, the basic premise of escaping the mental hospital despite and through the hallucinations did light up a bulb over my head. Some writer steal the idea and turn it into a good thriller please! -The fight sequences are fun. Need I say more? -Music was good too. -Babbydoll is packing an AMT Hardballer. Fans of Mr.47 rejoice<br/><br/>Cons -It's not really a movie, it's the unholly child of a first person shooter and Dostoyefski. Guess what? It didn't work. -Watching women cleaning potatoes in those clothes (or absence thereof) is too much of a WTF moment even for 13year olds. -The ending killed whatever little fun the movie could have given to the audience. OK it was a hallucination, just keep the drugs pumping for another 5 minutes PLEASE. Gimme an over the top escape through fire and brimstone. Anything but what really happened. -You never learn what really happened to people that died during the hallucination -OK Sweety Pie gets free. So, she was in the mental hospital because....? (i'm betting good money on mass murder)<br/><br/>I'm giving it a 5 out of 10 because it does have enough going on to watch it ONCE mostly for the visuals, and also a lot more importantly, it's not The Last Airbender. Oh, FYI, I don't mean cinema once, i mean DVD once. Maybe.<br/><br/>This is my first review I hope I'm making some sense, and also cut me some slack, English isn't my native."

","Sucker Punch is an attempt by Zack Snyder to tell a story on different levels of reality. A young girls is committed to an asylum by her violent stepfather after accidentally killing her sister in an attempt to save her from being raped. She has five days until a lobotomy is performed on her, instigated by her abusive stepfather. And now things get complicated: the asylum is a casino cum brothel where the girls have to work as dancers and prostitutes and they have five days to escape. Baby Doll, the protagonist, finds out that she can mesmerize men by lascivious dancing. And during those dances she escapes into a fantasy world where she and her fellow inmates are superheroes on a quest. Eventually we find out that there is a third layer of reality. To some extent the film works but I got the impression that Snyder had an idea that didn't really carry a feature film and fills the time with drawn out action scenes. These are well made (although too hectic for my taste) but you never et engaged because you know it's only a fantasy, it distracts from the real storyline and they are not really connected. That's why to me the film as a whole does not work, it seems to be patched together. Although I like the idea of these fantasies as am means of empowerment, it doesn't work because they became a means in themselves. The ideas are hardly new: we have seen very similar ideas in The Prisoner, The Singing Detective and others. No so marks for originality there. It seems Snyder is at his best when he can focus on directing within the clear framework of a defined storyline."
"evan_harvey","6","1","4","9 April 2011"," Great visuals, disappointing story
","Okay. Saw it a few days ago. I liked the film, I'll buy it on DVD. Now for the part that will make everyone will click ""Not helpful"":<br/><br/>*Spoilers* (of course) The story is half-assed. Snyder is a brilliant director, but a poor storyteller. It's like Snyder has taken the concept of ""dream within a dream"", but then not given us any real narrative or point. The ending is very disappointing. It just doesn't make sense. What that means is that the film is immediately rendered very one-dimensional, because it relies so heavily on the ending. That's the point that ties it all together, and it's missing.<br/><br/>Maybe I went into it expecting the story to have meaning. Alas. As one reviewer put it, ""It's astonishing that you could take this many potentially incendiary elements and make something that crushingly dull"". I admit I did find parts of it dull. Yes the fight sequences are cool, and yes the visuals are neat, but it's very flat and shallow. There are potentially incendiary elements, but they're wasted. Maybe they'll come out in the director's cut?<br/><br/>Because the characters/storyline are/is flat, the film is dull. Yes, there's explosions, a cool Japanese battle-bot, steam-powered Nazi zombies (it's not actually steampunk, contrary to the buzz), Lord of the Rings Orcs, a dragon etc etc, but my main issue is that the film promises more but doesn't deliver. It almost does, so I don't know why Snyder couldn't pull it together. There's a throwaway line at the end about how the things that occur in the alternate reality actually occurred in the 'real' reality, but that's lazy storytelling. It's like he filmed a bunch of stuff, and then said, ""Oh, by the way, all that really happened"". Lazy storytelling.<br/><br/>So. If you want a film of chicks in tight clothes blowing stuff up, this is for you. It's a wild ride and looks great. If, like me, you wish that Snyder was a better storyteller who could have made a film that had depth and meaning, you'll not enjoy it so much.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 for great visuals. Worth the money. 2 out of 10 for being poorly written. Final: 6 out of 10."
"ced_yuen","Null","1","4","5 April 2011"," Snyder's first original story is a narrative mess, but has stunning visuals
","Zack Snyder has become a name associated with spectacular action, and his attachment to the next 'Superman' project has caused geeks everywhere to salivate. However, some have questioned his talent because of his tendency to rework other people's creations. It may be unfair to say that he has piggybacked his way to success on the works of Frank Miller ('300') and Alan Moore ('Watchmen'), but Snyder hasn't exactly tried to disprove this. Until now.<br/><br/>In 'Sucker Punch', a girl nicknamed Baby Doll (Emily Browning) is institutionalised by her evil stepfather, and signed up for lobotomy. She has five days before the doctor arrives, and plots an escape with the help of other inmates (Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, Jamie Chung). Conveniently, she creates fantasies, and fantasies within fantasies, that run parallel to each stage of her prison break.<br/><br/>None of this has much to do with the title, which serves more as a theme than anything else. ""Sucker punch"" is a fighting term used to describe an unexpected blow, a surprise attack. The idea is that the movie will be a surprise for the audience who, according to the tagline, ""will be unprepared"". If that tagline refers to the sensory treat on offer, it's spot on. <br/><br/>Baby Doll's fantasies transport her to snowy Feudal Japan, post-apocalyptic WWI trenches and fiery Medieval castles. There are giant Samurai demons, dragons, robots, orks and Steampunk German soldier zombies. The women, dressed in sexy outfits (naturally), kick ass using all sorts of swords, guns, aircrafts and even a Manga-inspired flying mech-suit. All of this is wonderfully choreographed and presented with a gorgeous overabundance of slow-motion.<br/><br/>Previously limited by his fidelity to source material, Snyder was able to splash his crazy imagination all over the blank canvas offered by 'Sucker Punch'. The result is nothing short of a neatly-presented eye-candy buffet. Putting aside the crazy content of the fantasy sequences, it is worth noting how refreshing it is to have action directed with panache and clarity of vision, without the plague of quick-cut editing and shaky-cam. 'Sucker Punch' reaffirms Snyder's reputation as a talented and visionary action director.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it also confirms suspicions about his narrative weakness. Wanting to prove himself by including the concept of a world within a world (à la 'Inception'), Snyder bit off more than he could chew, struggling to coordinate the different layers of fantasy. It is clumsy, embarrassing, and lacks nuance. Worst of all, skipping from one fantasy to another, the characters cannot develop and viewers never get attached.<br/><br/>The story is a mess - it is obvious that Snyder thought of really cool scenes first, and then tried to fill the gaps. That would be completely fine if Snyder was honest about making a mindless popcorn movie, because then viewers would know what to expect. However, he insists that 'Sucker Punch' ""empowers women"", which makes the movie sound less shallow than it actually is. His assertion ignores the high heels, miniskirts and push-up bras, not to mention the fact that the inmates are all incredibly attractive and impeccably made-up.<br/><br/>For any hot-blooded male, 'Sucker Punch' is certainly very entertaining, but do not expect the values of honour and brotherhood of '300', or the social commentary of 'Watchmen'. It is less a film than a fetishistic blend of video-games and soft-porn - a compilation of a teenage male's wildest, geekiest daydreams. For those who go in expecting otherwise, therein lies the sucker punch."
"kristjanjekimov","6","1","4","4 April 2011"," Movie that could have given so much, but failed to deliver.
","After seeing the trailer and previous Zack Snyder films, I was really looking forward to this picture. The first 10 minutes were amazing and I felt, that premises for a great movie was set. However after leaving the theater, I have to say that I was having mixed feelings. <br/><br/>Plot itself was quite easy and hopefully you have already read the synopsis, so I won't rewrite it. I can't say that there was anything particularly wrong with it, however I kept having the feeling, that firstly, they would have worked much better as short films, secondly all the episodes have already been used in other pictures as Batman Begins, All Quiet On Western Front and Lord Of The Rings. Storywise I was constantly waiting for something more, something what was just handing in the air, but never delivered. Thirdly, the characters never grew to their full potential. We didn't learn anything about Blondie, Amber, Blue and Dr. Gorski. Rockets and Sweet Peas background felt also incomplete. What I want to say, was that I never got the chance to grow into any of the charters.<br/><br/>On the other hand, visuals and soundtrack were solid. Zack Snyder knows how to manipulate the picture and bring every single detail to our attention. CGI and camera-work were great and unforgettable. Even if you did not know who was the director, colors and eerie atmosphere definitely had Snyders signature on it. Soundtrack was great and considering that music played a big role in the movie, was well chosen. In addition, bound with visuals, soundtrack created a memorable world. All in all, unfortunately this movie will be remembered by its visuals just like 300. Like my friend said, it was like a meal, that looked delicious, but lacked the taste."
"movieman1947","5","1","4","2 April 2011"," Glass Half Full
","Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch has amazing visuals, and music that drives the scenes really hard. However where the movie falls short is the story. The story appears to be a well thought out script with fantasy worlds, and alternate realities, but it never really gathers any sympathy towards the characters. <br/><br/>It was cool to see an action film filled with girls doing awesome moves and taking out the bad guys. But after the first action scene the fighting got kind of stale and repetitive, 'OK another slow motion back flip and shooting the gun while upside down.' <br/><br/>Perhaps it is with the success of 300, and Watchmen that has set the bar so high for Snyder's films, or the comparing of which makes Sucker Punch fall short. <br/><br/>This is by no means a bad movie, just not as good as one might expect from the likes of Zack Snyder."

"taromatrix","9","2","13","25 March 2011"," Would have been an 8 or 9 were it not for the disappointing ending. RANT ON
","First of all I want to say that I went in wanting to like this movie. I hadn't been this excited about seeing a movie since Kick ass. Unfortunately, this movie has a certain target audience with certain expectations and it clashes with those expectations, and not in a good way.<br/><br/>The movie is very much like a roller coaster. You hear great things about it and you get on the ride. The first 20 minutes or so of the movie is like the ride up the hill. It's slow, and you can't wait to get to the good parts of the movie. Then you take off, and the ride is awesome. Then, towards the end it gets bumpy and then it makes a sharp U-turn leaving you with whiplash and wondering why they destroyed a nice ride at the end.<br/><br/>What I liked:<br/><br/>The imaginary worlds were wonderful, and you just can't argue with 5 skimpily clad gorgeous girls with guns. The eye candy alone is worth the price of admission. <br/><br/>What I didn't like:<br/><br/>Abbie Cornish as Sweet Pea. Her acting was horrendous. I can't remember the last time I was actually irritated by such amateurish acting. She single-handedly manages to destroy the beginning of the movie with her horrible deliveries. Luckily she doesn't talk much in the rest of the film, and she seems to become better towards the end. We go to movies to be transported into a fantasy world. Unfortunately, her acting is so poor that it painfully reminds you that you are watching a movie and violently shoves you out of your fantasy world.<br/><br/>The ending. How can you lobotomize the Heroine? Killing off the other girls was bad enough, but that was the last straw. So the creators want to say that Sweet Pea is the actual Heroine? She's the lamest excuse for a heroine I've seen in a long time. Putting the bad acting aside, she is not a likable character. She is always negative and resists going along with the group. The movie talks about being strong and fighting but her character does not embody that. Even in the end she lets Baby Doll fight and runs away. Some heroine. They should have just stayed with Baby Doll as the heroine and let her fight her way out in the final scene. THAT would have been awesome.<br/><br/>What could have been better:<br/><br/>Basically, the audience is led to believe that this is a kick ass action fantasy movie. They are basically paying admission to have a good time. They want to see the girls kick ass. They want to see the bad guy lose. They want to see the HEROINE WIN. The ride is fun but ends in a train wreck. No one wants to see the characters they are rooting for fail. The movie fails the audience by straying from what is expected. I understand that the creators wanted to do something different. However, this should not have been one of the things to do differently.<br/><br/>As good as the fighting sequences were, they could have been better. Since the fantasy worlds were so over the top, the fighting and what the girls could do physically could have been even more over the top. I can't put my finger on it, but the hallway scene from Kickass had that something extra that the fight sequences in this movie didn't.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>The meat of the movie was as expected and enjoyable. The beginning was like some drawn out music video and could have been shorter. You expect the heroes to encounter adversity and overcome it; NOT succumb to it. If you don't care about the plot and just want to see some gorgeous action, it might be worth the price of admission to see it on the big screen. However, be prepared to be disappointed in the end.<br/><br/>I am praying that the Blu-ray release of this film will have an alternate ending where Baby Doll kicks ass in her real world. Getting revenge on her step father would be even sweeter. Then I can go from a 6 to an 8 or 9."
"dino_saur333","6","2","14","28 March 2011"," You'll be fine as long as you leave your brain at the door
","I know a good movie when I see one...This isn't one. But you can't really call it a bad movie. <br/><br/>Like much (read: all) of Zack Snyder's work, this movie is best watched with the reasoning part of your head mostly turned off. Just imagine that you're reading a cool comic book and then suddenly that comic decided it wanted to be a full length motion picture. That's essentially how I treated this movie and I believe that's really the only way to fully appreciate this movie.<br/><br/>On to the story. From the trailer, you can tell it's about escaping reality into a dream. The thing is that story is about a girl, called Baby Doll, who gets wrongly sent to a mental institution by an evil step-father. In order to escape the horrible reality of being trapped in the asylum, she escapes by imagining a dreamworld...where she is trapped in an illegal strip club / brothel...wait, what?<br/><br/>Anyway, while trapped in the brothel she comes up with a plan to escape an recruits a few friends. As they collect the needed items for their escape, she gives herself courage to go through the plan by...imagining herself in other crazy dreamworlds where she and her friends are super soldiers and her enemies are either zombies, cyborgs, mutants, or some strange combination of the former stuff.<br/><br/>So in case you missed that, she created dreamworlds to escape the horrible reality of the brothel, which is in itself a dreamworld she created to escape the horrible reality of the asylum...<br/><br/>And here is my biggest problem with the movie. Why the double layer of pseudo reality? I thought the story would be fine if they stuck with just brothel world. Or heck it would be also fine if they skip the brothel part and stuck with just being in the asylum. I think the only reason we even have the brothel part was because they needed an excuse to put the main cats in skimpy clothing (or, most likely, because Inception is still an internet meme at this point)<br/><br/>So the story kinda goes awry when we start jumping between one reality to another but overall, there is a solid plot that you can figure out if you think hard enough. It was a decent story but the character development was a little lackluster. Also, the word ""acting"" has a veeeeeery loose meaning here.<br/><br/>But the real appeal of this movie is of course the effects. Are the action sequences as crazy as we saw in the trailer? Yes. In fact what we saw in the trailers are just the tip of the iceberg. in typical Zack Snyder style, the action is intense, filled with complex choreography, cool use of weapons, sweeping camera movement, and the ever popular (read: quite annoying) use of slooooooooowwwwwww mooootioooon.<br/><br/>Granted, he does use the slo-mo thing rather tastefully, syncing the action with the movies awesome soundtrack. The slo-mo is bearable here, even appreciated at some scenes. But there was this once scene in the move where I think the slo-mo was pushing it a bit.<br/><br/>Credit to the guys who designed all of Baby Doll's dreamworlds though. The set design, both real and imagined, is excellent. Even though the movie is about escaping to non-reality, at least they didn't go totally into silly cartoon realms by removing all semblance of sense. It's like most Japanese anime: Nowhere near realistic, but not so removed from reason that you can't relate to it anymore.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was enjoyable. It had a decent story and cast and the effects in the action scenes were quite entertaining. Not terribly memorable but I'll probably want to pick it up when it comes out on video."
"Bloody_Savage","5","1","5","6 February 2012"," One long action-packed-gun-toting fan-boy fantasy sequence
","When it comes to Zack Snyder films, the first thing that you can be sure of is that that Sucker Punch is going to be visually stunning; if your eyes were starving fat people and Zack Snyder films were burgers, your eyes would be massaging themselves in a not entirely appropriate way with the burger residue without a thought for the consequences.<br/><br/>And yes, there are consequences. Whilst this film is very much 'my eyeballs have gained weight from the delicious visual burger that is Sucker Punch',there is a suspicious absence of credible plot. This isn't plot-driven like Indiana Jones and, let's admit it; everyone loves a good plot-drive now and again.<br/><br/>In every Indiana Jones film, our bull-whipping, jaunty-fedora-sporting action-archaeologist has been faithfully steered through the story by Spielberg and Lucas like an Action Man being played with by two 8-year-old children. We can forgive Spielberg and Lucas for their lack of character development because, much like a parent jangling their keys at a hyper-active toddler, we are sufficiently distracted by the shiny exciting plot to notice anything else. Despite the 'what I've just been through should make me have a cup of tea and a sit down and a serious think about my beliefs' moments (note: the holy, albeit Nazi-melting boxes; terribly ancient cup-guarding swordsmen; Willie Scott successfully screaming and whinging her way through the entire film without Indy killing her just so she would shut the f*ck up), at no point do any of the characters show any signs of developing as their personalities. Nothing. Not even a flicker.<br/><br/>It is the same with Sucker Punch. The girls happily pout and lady-kick their way through the film without any allusion that they are growing as people.<br/><br/>Similarly, our 'villain-in-residence' Blue Jones is a very 'Cruella De Ville' type gentleman. In the same way that we will never know whether a back-stabbing, two-faced Dalmatian tipped Cruella over the edge, causing her to want to skin and make a coat out of any future bastarding Dalmatians she sees, we will never know why Blue Jones is such a git. What is his motivation? Was he irrevocably hurt by some pouty, midriff-bearing young ladies in his youth? Is his final goal to skin and make a coat out of Baby Doll and the rest of the pouty lady-kickers? Who knows? We cannot begin to imagine the horrors he has seen at the hands of such beautiful, pouty tormentors.<br/><br/>The lack of character development could be forgiven if we had a plausible plot. Nope, scratch that, it could be forgiven if we had a plot that, whilst not plausible, actually made sense.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder tries to go all Inception on us and fails.<br/><br/>My interpretation is that 'Baby Doll' accidentally killed her sister whilst trying to kill generic sweaty abusive step-dad. Following this she was bunged into the nut house.<br/><br/>That is all fine (well as 'fine' as such a story can be up until this point).<br/><br/>What I don't get is why we are taken into Baby Doll's fantasy where the nut house is, in fact, some naughty gentleman's club where she and her pouty inmates are the dish of the day.<br/><br/>Now, whilst being confused at this point I do not entirely lose the will to live until we are then taken into Baby Doll's fantasy within a fantasy (which is heralded by Baby Doll beginning to do cheeky little 'sexy dance'). As a side note, I'm sure we were all quite willing to put up with the tissue thin plot in the hope that we got to see Emily Browning 'do a Jessica Alba' a la Sin City.<br/><br/>Instead, we end up confused as Baby Doll's fantasy takes us to Japan and a wrinkly Jack Crawford from Silence of the Lambs (who seems to be pretending to be Hattori Hanzo). Jack Crawford then tells her that, in order to escape from the naughty gentleman's club/nut house, she will need to collect five items. Thanks Jack Crawford! Baby Doll then kicks the ever-loving sh*t out of some giant Japanese samurai robots. Whilst dressed as a naughty school girl. Right.<br/><br/>Back in imaginary naughty gentleman's club Baby Doll proceeds to plan an escape from the imaginary sexy gentleman's club with the help of her fellow pouty inmates.<br/><br/>I won't continue the rest of my synopsis so as not to spoil it for those yet to eat this visual burger but I will say that it is basically one long action-packed, gun-toting fan-boy fantasy sequence.<br/><br/>It is like a fan-boy has filmed all of his fantasies about sexy young girls shooting and kicking in slow motion whilst wearing risqué outfits and then slapped in some half-arsed story between each fantasy sequence to create a film.<br/><br/>The combination of the 2 dimensional characters, everything in the film being visually stunning (excluding wrinkly Jack Crawford), and dubious plot leaves you feeling confused, yet strangely aroused.<br/><br/>Another plus point for this film was the soundtrack. Being confused and strangely aroused can be jarring so the least you can hope for is a fabulous soundtrack to be confused and aroused to. Sucker Punch delivers this with a surprisingly good mix of Bjork, Skunk Anansie, Queen, and Emiliana Torrini (to name a few). We are also treated to the added bonus of Emily Browning chirping away on both 'Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)' and 'Asleep'. I was pleasantly surprised that young Browning has a lovely set of pipes on her and held her own on the soundtrack. Browning was joining some pretty big artists on the track I did not notice it was her until I checked the soundtrack listing. She slotted in there a sneakily as a sneaky ninja at the World Sneaking Championships. Well done Browning, well done.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film 5 stars and a Golden Melinda Messenger goes to Emily Browning's pout."
"jacob-j-mouradian","3","1","5","3 February 2012"," A failed but laudable attempt.
","When I had first seen the trailer, I thought: ""Wow--I'm not a big fan of Zack Snyder but this trailer looks awesome! And seeing as this is his first original story, this could be a worthwhile experience."" I really wanted to like it, I really did. But, alas, I didn't--and this was even after watching the Director's Cut.<br/><br/>The film is set in a 1950s-like world and follows a young girl who, after her mother dies and she is abused by her stepfather, is thrown into a mental institution on a trumped up charge of being dangerously insane. Upon arrival she is set to be lobotomized within a matter of days, and in a state of desperation she enters a fantasy world in which she must defeat the evil men who run her life and escape from her imprisonment.<br/><br/>Apparently this film was supposed to be a critique of the sci-fi fantasy geek fandom and the sexism that is a rather rampant quality of the male-dominated realm. Sadly, the film fails to do such a thing as it instead embodies what it is trying to satirize. The female leads are all acted quite poorly (especially Baby Doll, played by Emily Browning) and their characters are very underdeveloped--not exactly helping the supposed cause. They are reduced to being mere sexual images that must resort to entering their imaginations in order to gain any willpower to fight back against their oppressors. I don't consider myself a feminist at all, but this film becomes quite misogynistic at times and that is a bit uncomfortable.<br/><br/>The visual style is intoxicating--and not necessarily in a good way. All of the computer-generated effects look pristine and sharp, but they are coupled to action sequences that are over-abundant and boisterous, leaving the audience with little breathing room in-between each one. What should've been exciting and fun turns dull and irritating.<br/><br/>The story jumps around from dream world to dream world so much that the fantasies start to blur in one's mind. It becomes random, an unregulated mess of segments thrown together to appeal to those with a short attention span. Honestly, I haven't seen a sci-fi fantasy geek's wet dream bigger than this since Heavy Metal.<br/><br/>Also--this may just be a personal gripe--but I dislike Zack Snyder's use of slow-motion. It wasn't as bad in this film as it was in some of his previous works, such as his adaptations of ""300"" and ""Watchmen"", but he seems to use it whenever possible and it becomes tedious to watch as you just want the story to keep moving along.<br/><br/>That being said, the film was a laudable attempt. Failed, yes, but laudable, especially for a director who's been trying so hard to appeal to the geek fandom and finally had enough of their harsh criticism. In addition, the music is surprisingly enthralling. Most of the songs are not original but are redone in a captivating way that tries its best to set the mood for the trainwrecks of scenes they accompany.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Sucker Punch is a film that had potential but got lost in its illusions of grandeur. It's all about the style and lacks the substance. Is it the worst film ever? No, but it is far from being good."

","The best thing I can say about this movie is that it made me appreciate ""300"" & ""Watchmen"" that much more. (""Watchmen"" is a criminally under-rated movie. It is rates w/ ""The Dark Knight"" &""The Crow"" as maybe the best movie based on a graphic novel ever.)<br/><br/>Zack Snyder is a victim of his own talent here. He present us --again-- with stunning visuals, but they don't add up to anything. His ""women in peril"" plot seems tired. Most critically I didn't care about any of the characters. The acting is rather by rote. I felt sorry for talents like Jena Malone & Carla Gugino for being stuck inside this candy coated empty shell. You could almost feel Snyder pulling back from delivering a knockout blow in order to deliver a PG-13 rating, but I don't think movie would've have benefited from that added freedom because it seemed so pointless.<br/><br/>It may prove to be the biggest disappointment of the year in cinema."

","Following on the heels of his over-hyped, super-stylish and widely-embraced 300 and Watchmen, director Zack Snyder takes on the classic theme of misogyny in the swords-and-corsets, avenging-angel fantasy, Sucker Punch.<br/><br/>300 basically gave its viewers scantily-clad Spartan warriors fighting to survive (in order to fight another day). Watchmen did the same thing ... although its characters were superhero-clad warriors fighting to survive (in order to fight another day). Sucker Punch features a group of young women who dress like dancers that ... (guess what they fight to do?!).<br/><br/>The story is that of Baby Doll's (Emily Browning - Sleeping Beauty, A Series of Unfortunate Events) as she escapes the clutches of an abusive step-father only to be deposited into a mental institution for wayward girls who is scheduled to be lobotomized within one week's time. In order to cope and survive her harsh new reality, Baby Doll imagines a world of dancing and lurid, kick-ass action sequences (we get everything from dragons to samurai warriors to WWII Nazis in some highly choreographed film montages).<br/><br/>Oscar Isaac (Robin Hood, Agora, Body of Lies) plays the corrupt captor of Baby Doll and her fellow inmates Rocket (Jena Malone - Pride & Prejudice, Life as a House), Rocket's older sister Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish - Bright Star, Limitless), Amber (Jamie Chung - The Hangover Part II, Grown-Ups) and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens - High School Musical, Beastly). A lot could be read-into Sucker Punch with its themes and its objectification of women and I'd venture to say some of it (most, actually) would be correct; but the action sequences at the very core of the movie (while choreographed nicely) prevent the film from being much more than male-fantasy.<br/><br/>While 300 had Snyder's biggest box office and was his biggest success, it had the least amount of story ... and it has been interesting to see what his fans and (shrinking) audiences have fawned over. Dawn of the Dead, 300, Watchmen and Sucker Punch were all dramatically different and have shown a large-variety of directing choices/methods. To be fair, Sucker Punch had a lot of potential but most of it was squandered and turned into an uncertain film. The trust given to him to direct/helm the upcoming Man of Steel (another retelling of Superman) is HUGE. With another ""disaster"" like Sucker Punch (referring to BO only as my eyes have seen much worse), Snyder and his career may be sucker-punched as well ... and it could be GAME OVER before his career ever had much of a chance. <br/><br/>His artistic vision (which I admit is grand) might be extinguished if he cannot seamlessly blend/meld storytelling with his renowned artistry."

Movies like this try to use block buster special effects as their only selling point - but without characters you care about, a solid story you can relate to and an over all understanding of who your audience is - what you end up with is a 2 hour video game in which you are just an observer. This film actually reminded me of the miserable failure ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"". If you saw that movie you'd know what I'm talking about - All special effects, no story, and no characters you care about.

It went the same way as Pan's Labyrinth but added violence into the fantasy too so there was no good part in it, the characters sucked, soundtrack didn't fit in, and copied so much from other movies. I can't believe Zack Snyder did this, being the same guy from movies I love so much (300 and Dawn of the Dead), how could he make this. Please don't watch this, I believe that is what he would want if he still wants to be looked at as a great director. Even though everyone sucked in this I still have to say Jena Malone was pretty good in it as always."

","Browning, aka Creepy Eyes, is taken to a mental institution because she mimes through the opening of non-stop thunderstorms concluding with her firing a pistol leading people to debate endlessly if that was what killed her younger sibling or if it was the stepfather(and of course, the ones talking about how the heck this thing is supposed to make sense). Once there, she retreats to two layers of imagination, so that people who loved this and can't justify it can compare it to Inception. The first is at a cat-house(apparently also meant to have people trapped, albeit this is barely established) where she meets other young sets of legs of varying acting ability, the second has this handful of hot chicks taking on Nazi zombies and Orcs using small arms in bad-ass(well, some will find them monotonous, and they are repetitive and like looking at someone else play a video-game), stylish, well-choreographed action sequences(if excessive in amount of slow-motion... that's not new, at least he doesn't speed up any footage, it's just naturally fast) that mix different periods well, and produce the only memorable visuals(Snyder's strong suit) of this(and they are few and far between, clearly some of the ones that do not reach this level were expected to... much of this has unimpressive cinematography and near the end a lot of shots are really awkward because of setup that end in a powerfully underdone pay-off), setting it apart from the bland look of the rest of this. What we have is a combination of two sub-genres, the high-octane Hollywood Summer blockbuster and the prison escape movie, and they're like putting oil and water together. It feels like Zack, who I do hope goes back to adapting the work of others, had the shoot-outs in his head and just wrote *something* to fit inbetween them. The climax is weak, as with Dawn of the Dead and 300. ZS overbears the crap out of the soundtrack, exactly as with Watchmen(every song clearly means something specific to the scene, and it's always obvious and takes you out of it). I know, there's supposed to be this amazing depth to this, even if the metaphors are pretty straightforward. Maybe I am missing something, even so, it's just not that compelling to watch. Character development is lacking(Emily gets by largely with pouting), and the dialog is decent at best. We have an old guy who symbolizes wisdom and spouts American fortune cookie advice whenever we see him. There is inspiration drawn from cultural sources, including Animé, and you'd be better of just sticking with the original. There is mild violence and disturbing content in this(you can tell they wanted to go further, this wasn't meant to be PG-13). I recommend this to, well, people who find themselves agreeing with the people who seem to defend this regardless of what others say. Everyone else, maybe borrow it from a friend and fast-forward through anything that doesn't have bullets. 5/10"

","The tagline for Sucker Punch was ""You Will Be Unprepared"". The marketing team were spot on the money. Zack Snyder has concocted one of the most nutso films I have ever seen. There are 20 foot tall granite ninjas with Gatling guns. A Lord of the Rings-esque battle with orcs and dragons... and machine guns. An alternate World War I featuring heavy-duty one-person machines (à la Avatar) and a Nazi regime that has devised a way to have their dead continue on fighting. And there's an epic sword fight aboard a train with countless futuristic robots (who must be cousins to Sonny, the sentient from I, Robot), which is, mind-bogglingly, the sanest action sequence you'll witness within this sugar-rush of a movie.<br/><br/>Snyder has yet again proved he's in the highest echelon of visually enthralling filmmakers working today. He has a unique way of presenting action; it's frenetic, ultra-slick and is always perfect in respect to the special effects. Although the apparent free reign he was given over Sucker Punch, and the subsequent extreme style-over-substance output, has not made for his best movie as the story is essentially non-existent and the characters are more one-dimensional than cardboard cut-outs. This doesn't dampen the flick's bonkers entertainment factor, but it does mean the gap-filling scenes between set-pieces are yawn-inducing and the characters proffer the occasional unintentional giggle despite solid enough acting by the talented cast (including the young Aussie actress Browning) – who are, it must be said, decked out in the most fetishistic costumes you could possibly imagine.<br/><br/>As he demonstrated with Watchmen, Snyder has a predilection for utilising well-known tunes, often remixed, in places you would least expect to hear them. It's quickly becoming his trademark and he outdoes himself here with a dialogue-free opening segment set to a dark and intensely powerful version of The Eurythmics ""Sweet Dreams"", performed by lead actress Emily Browning no less. There's also a wonderful rendition of the Pixies' ""Where Is my Mind?"", again featuring Emily Browning on vocals, as well as an awesomely punked-up remix of Bjork's ""Army of Me"". It's these awe-inspiring song choices along with the aforementioned visual feasts that ensured I was hooked, despite its numerous, and obvious, shortcomings.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch is the cinematic equivalent to a wet t-shirt competition: silly, juvenile and superficial, but by god it's fun to watch.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)"
"bonehead","7","1","5","11 April 2011"," Unsatisfying, but it grows on you
","I'm not a huge fan of either Watchmen or 300, but they're reasonable in my opinion - I think Zack Snyder is missing some spark of greatness that will make his films truly epic - I don't know if it's experience or attitude, but hopefully someday he'll overcome it.<br/><br/>Overall, I found Sucker Punch unsatisfying due to its flaws - the problem I have is determining whether the flaws are actual or perceived. I do know that I was rather disappointed reading an interview with Snyder where he revealed that the title alluded to how he wanted to sucker punch the audience. Yeah, great plan Zack.<br/><br/>I'll give my summary, for it colors how I viewed the movie: A girl's mother dies and her complete bastard of a stepfather gets control of her and her younger sister. During an attack, she tries to shoot him but instead kills her sister. The stepfather puts her in an institution and pays off the crooked doctor to have her lobotomized in five days, and five days later the doctor shows up and starts the procedure.<br/><br/>At that point, she withdraws in her mind to a weird combination of fantasy and memory. In this fantasy, everyone calls her Baby Doll and the asylum is actually a brothel where the head doctor sells the patients out as whores, each of whom has their own dance used to entice customers. In this fantasy, the girl cooks up a plan to escape with the aid of her fellow inmates.<br/><br/>Baby Doll, in this fantasy, dances so incredibly that anyone who watches is spellbound and oblivious to events around them. When Baby Doll dances, she imagines a fantasy world in her mind, where she is a superhero-like warrior, and her and the other girls have all sorts of fantastic adventures.<br/><br/>Using this power, the girls (still in the dream here) hatch a plan to escape by stealing what they need while Baby Doll is dancing.<br/><br/>Not all works out as planned, however, and only one of the girls (Sweet Pea) actually makes it out, with Baby Doll sacrificing herself so that the last girl can be free and return to her parents.<br/><br/>At that point the movie returns to the actual real world, Baby Doll is lobotomized, but the crooked doctor is found out and arrested, and presumably gives up the evil stepdad as well. In the process, we find out that many of the events Baby Doll dreamed about in those last few seconds of lucidity did actually happen in the real world. All in all, it was a pretty dismal ending, even if it did continue on to show Sweet Pea making it to safety at the end.<br/><br/>The movie was very impressive visually, with an awesome soundtrack and a lot of real suspense.<br/><br/>But now for the flaws, in no particular order.<br/><br/>1. Many people failed to recognize the first transition, and believed the brothel was real. That's not necessarily the fault of the movie, but given how many of the reviews seem to miss it, I do put the blame on the shoulders of the film itself.<br/><br/>2. The action sequences were awesome, but each subsequent one was less awesome that the previous - not a good trend. One would have expected exactly the opposite, with the action sequences building in intensity and excitement as the film progressed, rather than getting worse.<br/><br/>3. I may just be giving the film the benefit of the doubt when I say the stepfather would be caught, but even if he was, destroying Baby Doll at the end was a horrific anti-climax which the slim remainder of the movie could not make up for. I don't know if he was intentionally going for a One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest vibe or I'm just being too gracious, but either way I don't think he pulled it off.<br/><br/>4. The tying together of the dream world/brothel events with the ones in the real world (the map, the fire, the knife, the key) was subtle, so much so that it seemed like an afterthought, and it was unsatisfying to find out after Baby Doll was lobotomized that she had actually been doing all those things (and see #6 below).<br/><br/>5. Sweet Pea was the *least* sympathetic of all of the girls, so having her be the one who made it out was especially unsatisfying. We see all the girls killed except Sweet Pea and Baby Doll (including Sweet Pea's sister who gives HER life for the cause), and then Baby Doll sacrifices herself for Sweet Pea.<br/><br/>6. Finally, I recognize that Baby Doll had little to live for (after all, her Mom died and she accidentally killed the only person important to her, her sister), but even so she was not portrayed as being so hopeless that she wanted to end it all, even if the final doctor said ""she looked like she wanted me to do it."" It was too jarring to make sense. No, I wasn't expecting the ending to be all tied up in a nice pretty bow, but nor did I expect such a horrific ending, especially given that it was revealed that she'd tried so hard to get out and stay alive.<br/><br/>Anyways, the flaws, overall, are severe enough to me so that I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone, and yet I give it a rating of 7 simply because I think that Zack Snyder accidentally created something better than he really ought to have."

","- <br/><br/>I love Zack Snyder's work; it is purely a sensory experience. He's heard about acting & understands that the characters in his pieces need to pull funny faces as they deliver their lines, but has never let it get in the way of his vision. For some people that's a bad thing, they however do not appreciate that as an art form cinema has room his acting light style & is enriched by it.<br/><br/>If I was to compare his work to a style of painting it would be the Baroque with its rich pallet & lavish use of contrast, but that comparison is not a good one. Firstly he puts more depth & perspective into his frames than most 3D films can manage. He then rounds out his digital labours with a perfect union of sound & movement. <br/><br/>I would, as a side note, suggest that Mr Snyder spend a little time with a mental health professional who specialises in the area of non- consensual lovemaking, because after playing out his guilt laden rape fantasies to the public in Three films now, they don't seem to be in any way resolved.<br/><br/>Now for the future, I say bring on Superman. Though I would give a little warning to the poor actress being lined up to play Lois Lane as it's far more likely that Zacky boys General Zod's idea of putting her in peril will be cornering her in a dark alley & bashing her back doors in!"
"ArdentViewer","3","1","6","7 May 2020"," Very Disappointing (This Will Be an Unpopular Opinion)
","I've wanted to see this film for years. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with the execution. The cutaways between ""reality"" or (mid-reality) and the fantasy fight sequences were abrupt, intrusive, and disjointed. I did not care for these sequences at all - they were uninspired and flashy but lacked depth and did not seem to fit with the flow of the film. I found myself only half-watching and waiting to return to the main plot. I think they would have fit in a different film (pure video-game or comic genre) but the contrast did not work for me at all. It was like watching two different movies that did not meld together. There could have been much more effective and satisfying ways to create fantasy worlds/alternate realities without cutting to contrived supposed ""dance sequences"" that were never shown in lieu of a random collection of overblown battle/mission scenarios.<br/><br/>All of this is before the letdown ""twist"" ending. This movie could have been great in the right hands. I couldn't say if the problem was the script, direction, editing. It just didn't work for me on any level. The narration throughout the movie did nothing to help its cause and seemed like a pathetic attempt to bring higher meaning to a meaningless story."

","Directed by Zack Snyder. Starring Emily Browning, Oscar Isaac, Abbie Cornish, Carla Gugino, Jena Malone, Scott Glenn, Jamie Chung, Vanessa Hudgens, Jon Hamm, Gerard Plunkett. (PG-13)<br/><br/>Pointless, humorless exercise in all-style-no-substance, presented as auteurist-vision, but the auteur is an emperor without clothes (or a clue). After being committed to an asylum by her sadistic guardian, Browning copes with the horrors of her situation by imagining herself as a prisoner-dancer in a burlesque house (leading to a different raft of horrors), then going another layer deeper into her imagination by becoming a pin-up warrior in CGI-soaked battlegrounds. She and her fellow dancers wear fetishistic adornments and fight armies of enemies (often in obnoxious slo-mo); it sometimes looks pretty, but there's no tension or excitement in these passive-participant video games, and the stakes couldn't be lower or vaguer if an invincibility cheat code had been entered. The movie trots out undeveloped female ""heroes"" that look clipped out of ""Maxim"" magazine, lets the camera leer at them at length while subjecting them to endless abuse, threats and violence, then slaps its own wrist for being naughty and protests that it's all about female empowerment; co-writer/director Snyder clearly wants to have his cake and slobber on it, too. Deplorable provocation aside, its greatest sin is just being a dreadful bore. One may need a sucker punch right to the kisser to stay awake.<br/><br/>10/100"
"CANpatbuck3664","4","1","6","13 October 2017"," Ambitious to a Fault, Sucker Punch's Story and Style Drag Down Great Visuals and Decent Action
","Sucker Punch is the story of Babydoll and her journey to escape her past. The story has some very serious undertones and I can respect the attempt to tell this deep and encompassing story. There are layers upon layers of symbolism and hidden meaning. The ambition to try and tell this kind of story is admirable but where Sucker Punch falls down is trying to interweave these elements together. It isn't the plot holes (there are a few) or the implausibilities (there are even more) that drag this movie down, its the plot collapsing in on itself that does Sucker Punch in. Executing this kind of movie would be hard for an expert filmmaker and they can't stick the landing.<br/><br/>Snyder and his team drop Babydoll and her comrades into crazy fantasy after crazy fantasy to establish a metaphor for them gaining what they need to execute Babydoll's plan. This is where I have to give them a backhanded compliment. Snyder's visual sensibilities are perfect for this and each level he creates is impressive. It's like watching this team of girls execute missions in a video game that spans decades and different worlds and that's definitely entertaining. The problem is that they have no sense of continuity and although I perfectly understood the metaphor they're going for (how this is an escape for Babydoll's horrific reality), the execution of it is clunky. The technology in each setting varies wildly (samurais with railguns? Mech suits in WW1? Fighting orcs with assault rifles?) and there aren't any consequences to the action. The action within them is solid but they make little to no sense and the fact that they are Babydoll's escape shouldn't distract you from the fact that they don't have any purpose within the story. Add in Scott Glen's character Wise Man, who delivers advice that is confusing and seems to hold almost no relevancy to the current situation and Sucker Punch is frustrating to watch.<br/><br/>You don't see many action movies led by a female ensemble and that's one of the more refreshing aspects of the movie. While I think this movie has more than its fair share of shortcomings, I don't want to blame the actors and actresses. I don't think that anyone really shines through but you can only do so much with the material you've been given. Emily Browning is pretty wooden but I think that was a deliberate choice. I just had a hard time getting attached to her because of it. The rest of the main cast are all well cast but there is little to distinguish between them. If I had to single one out of the group, Jena Malone is the next best. Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung amount to window dressing which is too bad because I wish they'd been given more to do. Abbie Cornish is way too serious, Oscar Isaac is way too cartoonish as Blue and while Carla Gugino is well suited to her role, her bad accent undercuts her performance.<br/><br/>The defenders of Sucker Punch always point to the action as one of the saving graces of this film. This has always been another strong point of Snyder's work and while I think this movie delivers on the required set pieces, watching it a second time I wasn't astounded or blown away by the battle scenes. It merely comes across as serviceable as opposed to something jaw-dropping. The problem is that with this movie tripping over its own feet in other key areas, it needed to be something unique away to distract from those flaws.<br/><br/>I honestly believe that Zack Snyder wanted this to be an empowering movie for girls/women. The movie unfortunately moonwalks into being really sexist. The entire group of girls are beautiful but the movie takes every chance to show off their figures or accent the revealing clothing they're wearing. I get that most blockbusters featuring young and attractive women do this but we approach Michael Bay territory here. Add in the fact that in the most consistent fantasy that Babydoll has, they're all burlesque dancers who are only useful when dancing/putting on a show for their clients and it gives the movie an overall feel that this is just a teenage boy's fantasy. Either that or they're directly pandering to teenage boys, could be either option.<br/><br/>There are other things to comment on including a really terrible soundtrack (the music is mostly made up of covers of famous rock songs that completely miss the mark) and an ending that can't get the movie out of a serious tailspin. This is one of the more divisive blockbusters that has come down the pike and while I'm pretty critical of this, it isn't a flop for the ages. Snyder and his team really swung for the fences and while I credit them for trying, Sucker Punch adds up to a big and embarrassing whiff."
"Lomedin","7","1","6","28 November 2013"," Imaginative, geeky, crude
","It took me a little while to get used to this movie, since it's so different to any other film out there. It's great to have movies that separate themselves from the norm, and offer diversity to a saturated market of trash, clichés and stereotypes.<br/><br/>First of all, I'll state what a lot of people already did, the special effects are BRILLIANT. Something that, apparently, caught too much the attention of many and they forgot that there's actually a plot, people who seem to think that this is all special effects and violence, like some sort of pacific rim for adults.<br/><br/>Now, I like to see so many references to the geeky world here: anime, video games, cosplay, scifi, fantasy... All well mixed up in a potpourri that will make the nerds of the world go in ecstasies. C'mon, nazi zombies and samurai warriors with Gatling weapons? Yahoo! This is definitely a reference for all future anime/video games adaptations.<br/><br/>I admit that the hot babes with big guns put me off a little at the beginning. I don't like 5 cm long eyelashes and that type of things, contrary to some who find lolita complex and Barb Wire style movies a blessing. Then, I understood (or want to believe), that's it's necessary for the drama to make sure the audience sees how society (men, mostly) treat women, and how the females can actually defend themselves if they need to, thank you very much. It's hard to say the reality of it, since the babes and violence might have been just a marketing strategy to catch a wider audience. Although the depth of the plot and how it unravels to the end makes me think otherwise.<br/><br/>Ah, remember to watch the Extended Cut of the film (over 127 min), since the theatrical version was EXTREMELY edited (thanks censors for getting rid of logic, once again, to make more comfortable your reality of weak minded people). Apparently, if you watch the edited version, things don't make sense at all.<br/><br/>I also like the crudeness of certain scenes of the movie. It's a blow of fresh air to have some entertainment for adults, with so many twilights out there and politically correct giant robots fighting monsters (wink to del toro).<br/><br/>Alas, as some other reviewer commented, one has to wonder if certain people were watching the same movie when they say that it's shallow and simple. Certainly, they might have missed the point and thought that perfect special effects cannot but equal an immature plot.<br/><br/>I can only say, well done."
"trims","3","1","6","30 April 2012"," So awful, I don't know where to start...
","I'm being generous here with a three-star rating, mostly because I can see that the video-game violence and scantily-dressed teen girls (even though they're all played by 20-somethings) might have an appeal to a certain audience.<br/><br/>First off, how on earth is this a PG-13 movie? Oh, that's right, you don't get a R these days unless there's some bare tits, or an actual disembowelment shown. Don't be fooled by the ""fantasy"" violence claim - sure, it's not Saving Private Ryan realism, but the violence is still presented in a realistic manner (sidestepped with the ""but it's only a dream"" shtick). There's also more than enough ""shake-your ass and tits for the camera, girls"" action to disqualify this from any semblance of modesty - let's face it, this is blatant sexual exploitation and gratuitous sex, all presented with a veneer of clothing to make it past the MPAA.<br/><br/>The CGI is passable - it's at the quality level of a good XBox 360 game. The fight scenes are ludicrous (not even really entertaining in an over-the-top way). The settings are ridiculous (even for a ""dream"" sequence) - how's a 10-foot tall traditional samurai with a MINIGUN fit in? It doesn't, it's just there to look cool, which fails - it's just ridiculous. Dialogue - well, I guess, the best thing that can be said is there's little of it, so we only have to cringe occasionally when some cliché movie quote is tossed out like it was from Moses on the Temple Mount.<br/><br/>Finally, there's no plot. None at all. We're presented with an interesting premise at the opening, then it really goes nowhere. No character involvement either - each of the girls is a cardboard cutout, with the supporting cast as a bunch of stereotypical bad-guy (or bad-girl) roles filled by real actors who must have been either paid a huge amount to debase their skills in this thing (I can't call it a movie), or were simply bamboozled by the script.<br/><br/>Don't see this. More importantly, don't let your teenage son or daughter see it; I'd classify this thing as more damaging to a teenager than watching a full blood-and-sex film like Shoot Em Up.<br/><br/>In the end, this comes across as what a 13-year-old boy (raised on XBox) thinks is cool, what at 15-year-old boy who (who surfs internet porn) thinks is sexy, and what a 17-year-old Emo boy thinks is deep and meaningful. The sick thing? It's made by a 45-year-old ""man""."
"society_crashdummy","4","1","6","3 July 2011"," My opinion of this movie (Contains ""surface"" spoilers)
","The reason why I give this movie a 4 score is solely based on the acting, which was great. However, the story sucked because I felt that the ending wasn't played rightfully for the characters involved. I understand that this is not a fairy tale but I also don't agree with the abuse of women and this condition is one of those times, regardless of it being fake this movie didn't settle very well with me and doesn't deserve to be making much at the box office due to an awesome trailer. I could go on about the good and bad of the movie, but I will just say that if you plan to make your audience love a character you want to keep with it. Don't drop it off a cliff over halfway through the movie."
"Matt_Layden","5","1","6","26 June 2011"," What's the purpose?
","A young girl is institutionalized by her abusive stepfather, after she accidentally kill her little sister. Not able to cope with reality, she retreats to an alternate reality where she comes up with a plan to escape. That's putting it lightly.<br/><br/>If you want a more literal translation, for some reason she chooses to escape to a whore house fantasy, where she dances for people. When she dances for people she escapes yet again, to a more stylized and action oriented fantasy. I think Snyder needed an excuse to show his creative imagery and instead of trying to craft a reasonable story, he throws together some kind of conglomerate mess of proportions. Here is a guy who has had success in adapting other works of art. Whether it's a remake (Dawn of the Dead) or a graphic novel (300, Watchman) Snyder's only real task was being able to translate something already written and visualized, to the big screen. This was his first attempt at something original. He fails. <br/><br/>As a visual spectacle, it's great. No denying that. But I recall a film by the name of Avatar being blasted for it's unoriginal story and the fact that it relied too heavily on visuals. Sucker Punch, while being original, lacks any sense of purpose in its story. Why do we care for these characters? The answer is we don't. Baby Doll has little to no dialogue, Rocket would make a better lead character to get behind. I felt more emotion for the baby dragon that is slain than any of the female characters that parade around in little to no clothing. A 14 year old boys wet dream. <br/><br/>That's how Sucker Punch comes off as, something Snyder thought up of when he was a kid. The film is for people with ADD, because Snyder hopes you forget the first 20 minutes of the film as he tries to surprise you with the ending, bringing it back to the beginning again. Why do we care for something that doesn't happen. Everything we see is her fantasy. When the ending is revealed as to what truly happen, we never get to see that reality. Snyder needs to mature as a filmmaker and stop treading around in these waters. <br/><br/>They seem to give up on their quest for objects half way through as well. They need a map in their first mission, they get it. Fire in the second, the succeed. A knife in their third and all of a sudden they are trying to steal a bomb? I'm sure there is an explanation for this somewhere, but it's missing in the film. Watching Inception beforehand will give people a better understand of a level within a level scenario that is attempted here. Inception is the better film and it pulls it off way more effectively, despite having more confusing elements, it comes off clearer than Sucker Punch. <br/><br/>A good soundtrack and entertaining visuals aren't enough for me to recommend this film. I'm sure the target audience will love it. Young boys who no attention span. It tries to cram every fantasy element into one: Dungeons and Dragons, Futuristic Science Fiction, Alternate History. The film has Nazis that look like Helghast from Killzone, dragons, robots, giant rock samurai that bleeds light. So many cool elements that are jammed together into a mess of a story line. Give me a reason to care for these 'fantasy' sequences and this film could have rocked my socks. Unfortunately I sat there wondering why I should even care, instead of enjoying myself. That's where the problem lies. You'll be wondering why should I care?"
"captelephant","5","1","6","27 March 2011"," A Pretty Disappointment
","I desperately wanted Sucker Punch to be good. Any large-budget blockbuster that has the balls to include dragons, mechs and nazi zombies in its PREVIEWS gets bonus points with me. <br/><br/>But Sucker Punch isn't very good. It's joyless and heartless and somehow manages to take itself waaaaay too seriously despite the aforementioned dragons, mechs and nazi zombies. For a movie that should be non-stop fun it's surprisingly dreary. That could have worked if that dreariness had generated any power or depth or emotional attachment, but it doesn't, so instead of being dramatic or epic the movie just becomes boring. <br/><br/>The interchangeable, embarrassingly over-fetishized girls are utterly invincible and never in any danger whatsoever... until the plot suddenly needs them to be, which is cheap and, again, boring. The brothel scenes almost immediately became tedious and I found myself impatient for the next action scene to begin.<br/><br/>Of course the action is fantastically well filmed and the special effects are gorgeous. Snyder is probably the best action director working today. But in Sucker Punch it's all so meaningless and lightweight that I felt more numbed than excited. And that's probably the most impressive thing about the movie: how do you make steampunk nazi zombie zeppelins unexciting? See Sucker Punch and find out! <br/><br/>Sucker Punch really isn't terrible. It's just a typical, brainless blockbuster that squanders its unique subject matter. It could have been so much more."
"GodsGladiator","6","1","6","26 March 2011"," Good, but Lacked Punch
","First of all, let me state that I'm a big admirer of Zack Snyder's ability to astonish the visual senses and, for lack of a better term, his ability to make the audience feel extremely ""badass."" However characteristic of his style, the film also unfortunately fell into his footsteps of tradition in terms of story and character: the plot was extremely thin, and the characters felt two dimensional. At numerous points throughout the film, I found myself extremely engaged in fantastic action sequences rich with steampunk imagery and almost anime-characteristic, intricately choreographed combat; yet, at the same time my own nondiegetic nagging voice questioned the intent behind the sequences. For example, the main character Baby Doll (Emily Browning) exists on three planes of existence (and to avoid spoilers, I will not further divulge information about them).<br/><br/>One of the three, however spectacular it appears to be, is completely disconnected from the plot or story, so much so that when watching these particular sequences, the viewer is almost asked to completely disassociate from the logical narrative world and plunge into a world of chaos and fantasy. While very engaging due to their nature as quasi-comic book action scenes characteristic of Zack Snyder's style, they serve little purpose in perpetuating the narrative or developing ulterior themes. They just look cool. This is unfortunate and very detrimental to the film, as the common film-goer may find this fantastic, but those looking for a deeper, more heartfelt message may find the film a bit dry. Additionally, this harmed numerous scenes with character interaction, especially with certain characters' states of finality (where the viewer knows what emotion should be felt, but the connection to the characters just isn't there to contribute to that emotion) in the closing images of the film. Knowing Snyder and his potential, though, the revelation of this fact was disappointing, albeit a bit expected; however, it's standard quality did not come as a complete sucker punch to me."

"cherold","4","1","7","12 October 2016"," Wants to be clever but doesn't know how
","In spite of the bad reviews, the trailer made me think this would, at the least, have some fun action scenes that would make it worthwhile. It was a reasonable theory, yet by the halfway point I was completely bored.<br/><br/>The premise seems clever. After a miserably grim sequence in which a young girl undergoes trauma and is unjustly institutionalized and slated for a terrible fate, she re-imagines her plight as a girl kidnapped to a brothel, and then, from the brothel, re-imagines her life as an action movie involving swords and guns, blimps, and a lot of gymnastic jumping.<br/><br/>But there doesn't seem to be anything behind that cleverness, at least in the first half, which was all I watched. The three different realities have a few connectors - items and people - but they don't seem to have any narrative purpose. It's as though the writers saw Intercept and thought all they needed was to strew some intersecting plot elements about and they'd get the same thing. <br/><br/>Having read the wikipedia plot summary, I'm glad I didn't finish this one, as the end strikes me as both unsatisfactory and another example of an idea unmoored from real purpose beyond trying to do something cool.<br/><br/>That's what this movie is - a trying to do something cool. And yes, there are cool things, like steampunk soldiers that bleed steam and hot action girls in skimpy clothes. But any fun that might suggest is counteracted by a relentless, murky sourness that pervades the film. It feels as though the director was afraid people might enjoy this too much to appreciate its depth, but since it has no depth, that was a mistake. <br/><br/>This is rather typical of Zack Snyder, who seems to be torn between a desire to make something pretentiously arty and a desire to make something full of popcorn action. Sometimes, as in Man of Steel, he balances the two, but sometimes, as in Sucker Punch or Batman vs. Superman, he creates films at war with themselves."
"Aaron_West","5","1","7","1 June 2014"," Zach Synder's visually inventive but utterly stupid exploration of fantasy.
","Sucker Punch is a film that seems to precisely targeted at teenage boys who like video games and want superficial action and lots of cleavage. <br/><br/>You cannot fault Zach Synder's unique but increasingly drilling visual style, and never more so than here in Sucker Punch; the colours are simultaneously lulled and saturated, the blacks are blackest, the slow motion in abundant, and camera work is inventive and kinetic. However not to make a film visually dazzling is near impossible for a film with a big enough budget to spend on CGI, which Sucker Punch certainly has, all £82 million of it (and that certainly went all on visuals because the writing must of cost nothing and the acting must have cost even less than that). <br/><br/>This worked well in Watchmen, because the visuals are meant to be comic and dark, the story is already written so you cannot go too far wrong, and the film works as actual satire on comics so the acting can be excusably bad.<br/><br/>The fantasy sections play like increasingly ridiculous video games, and are written like Zach Synder just combined random words together - for example, clockwork stamping WW1 German zombies - and don't even play as coherently as the dream levels in Inception. <br/><br/>The ending seems to subvert the traditions of cinema (or at least action films), this is likely intentional, but soon reprimands any surprises with quick and lazy ""look this film is actually written"" scenes which work up to nothing without the necessary build up.<br/><br/>I can also not tell if Sucker Punch is blatantly sexist or a feminist statement - which is never a good thing for a film to be. <br/><br/>Overall if you like the poster for Sucker Punch, with all its breasts, bums, crotchless pants, robots, guns, and dragons, then you will likely enjoy the film - if not forget it even before the credits have even begun.<br/><br/>Those who love the film will likely call any critics or skeptics pretentious, which is fine, they can."

The representation of women were awful, being over sexusalised, and over 'perfect'. Highly unrealistic! Plus, was there really any need for the imaginative Brothel?! No! That was an excuse to get them wearing sexy clothes..The directer explained that the Brothel was her escape from the mental hospital, however I don't think selling your body to sleazy men would make her feel any better about herself. I also wonder when Baby doll is doing the erotic dance to distract the men, what was she really doing in real life? I personally feel, that if they had never used the Brothel idea what so ever, I probably would have taken the film more seriously. With all the imaginative scenes of war fighting to symbolize their 'mission', surely that was enough!"

It's an action movie, so it's short on story but why would you come watching it for anything other than what it is? Overall I'd say that if you like anime, comic books, have ever played an RPG, or are a fan of chicks and guns it's worth your time. If you don't like such things this probably isn't for you.

","This film is terrible on so many levels that it hurts to even remember it. I can't believe that so many other reviewers are so dense and mindless that they'll defend this movie adamantly. No, it is not ""misunderstood."" It is not a complex art film meant to be viewed with an understanding of some deep external context. This movie was sold to us as ""300 but with badass women"" and instead we get ""I wish I was Inception but good luck finding the story in this pile of debris...oh, and here's some random fast-paced feminine butts and CG explosions to stare at so you don't feel like you were completely ripped off by the trailers.""<br/><br/>There are those who say it's a glorious film that bathes in the light of strong female empowerment. Excuse me, but did you and I watch the same movie? I won't drop any spoilers but the ""non-Inception"" story AND the ""Inception level one"" story are so strongly the opposite of female empowerment that no one who isn't looking at the film through rose-colored glasses can hold it up as such. So much of this film is riddled with grossly unrealistic caricatures of evil males brutalizing fragile and helpless young women; an ideal feminist tale this definitely is not, yet many reviewers and even the actresses themselves have somehow eaten this lie up and regurgitated it ad nauseam.<br/><br/>For a moment, let's ignore the fact that both men and women are shown as hyperbolic representations of stereotypes. Let's ignore the lie told by the trailers showing an awesome CG-laden action extravaganza with awesome female heroes. The plot...isn't! This entire film attempts to be ""psychologically deep"" and fails so miserably that it is simply confusing and reeks of ""artsy for the sake of artsy."" Sucker Punch is the prime example of failure to execute the Inception style of story layering. There is essentially zero actual connection between the layers. There is one actual story that very little of the film spends time on and that is not explained or developed enough to be satisfying. The remaining chunks of the film focus on a completely different story that doesn't matter and a story within that story that matters even less. The connections between these three completely different plots are tenuous at best. It's difficult enough to write a single detailed plot and maintain continuity and consistency, so it comes as no surprise when this travesty tries to coarsely mush three mostly unrelated plots together and ultimately leaves them on the kitchen counter to rot.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave this film more than one star is the fantastic visuals within the action sequences. We were sold a film that was a sort of video game-like steampunk/fantasy 300 film with strong women that vaguely remind us of Samus Aran and that's what we all wanted to see. Granted, there are some serious problems with the action itself such as the obvious invulnerability of our heroes, but the visuals are hugely successful as eye candy. Everything else in the film resembled a dropped vase glued back together by a three-year-old, yet the action visuals are a work of art that could easily stand on their own. Even the plot underlying the action could have worked with a lot more thought and a lot more screen time.<br/><br/>This movie was supposed to be great. It wasn't. It developed a rabid fan base of mindless and tasteless movie-goers, but it seems like anything terrible that hits the big screen manages to vacuum up a pile of those. Don't waste your time seeing this. You can probably find the action stuff on a video site somewhere if you're interested in seeing those parts, but if you watch the actual film, you'll regret it and you'll never get that time back. If you want an attractive, strong female lead that is given excellent character development and beats the crap out of everyone that wrongs her, you're better off re-watching Kill Bill, because Sucker Punch doesn't even come close."

But the dazzle and flair used to thrill the audience with ass-kicking heroines is the only good point of this film. <br/><br/>Overall the strangest part of the film is the end credits where the cast performs on stage in a musical.

","I'd been excitedly awaiting Sucker Punch since I first saw the movie trailer in theaters quite some while ago. I don't think there are any spoilers in this review, other than perhaps some mentions of the movies character.<br/><br/>Being a fan of anything extraordinary/fantasy-like and loving Zack Snyders 300, i was sure this would be a hit for me. But no...<br/><br/>I find the storyline totally incomplete and shallow, no matter which (in lack of a better word) ""parallelle mind-universe"" Babydoll enters. The movie would have been much better if there had been more of a story to it. And there could easily have been so many great stories in this movie.<br/><br/>Both the musical and visual effects are to my taste, and I like the way Sucker Punch was filmed. The visual ideas and effects are why I ended on giving Sucker Punch rating of 3 stars. That being said, It seems to me that Sucker Punch pretends to be a much deeper movie than it really is, and that it uses it's 'mind-games' as an excuse not to give us more of a story. When really, it is poorly thought out, and no think-it-through-yourself can replace what should have been a better movie.<br/><br/>Yes, I had to think about the whole movie for a minute afterward to sort it out in my head, but after that my impression of this film was a disappointing one. It is OK to watch, just don't expect an impressive storyline, as I did."
"Kashmirgrey","6","1","8","25 March 2011"," Sin City Meets The Matrix
","Sucker Punch plays out like a video game/music video, and although some of its tactics are questionable, it proves to be somewhat of a unique and wow-inspiring experience. <br/><br/>Young girl (20? yeah right! Try more like 17) is committed to an insane asylum by her evil, pedophile stepfather after a rape attempt goes awry and she accidentally kills her little sister. The stepfather bribes one of the orderlies to put a rush order in for her unwarranted lobotomy, but during the week-long wait for the procedure, imagination propels her into an alternate reality consumed by action-fantasy. Accompanied by a handful of hotties, she does battle with colossal demonic samurai, ferocious orc-like Nazi stormtroopers, metropolis-destined WMD's, and even a fire-breathing dragon, all the while dressed in cleavage-boasting tops and schoolgirl miniskirts. It is a teenage boys dream come true.<br/><br/>Not over-overwhelmingly original, the trip is fun, the effects are cool and stylish, and I really dug the backdrop tunes. But I like video game flicks and admittedly, I found myself contemplating which of my library I was going to slip into the PS3 once I got home. To that end, the film was a bit of an inspiration.<br/><br/>I disagreed with the PG-13 rating. Responsible parents beware. The movie is packed with strong sexual under and overtones. Now before all you anti-censorship zealots get your panties crammed into wedgies, I agree that to take away from its extremely sexy seductiveness would leave it naked and rather impotent and I am merely suggesting it should have received the R-rating it deserved. Never mind that the matinée I hit held 50+ year old men as the majority in attendance (hmmm)... This is an exploitation flick flaunting young, scantily-clad, cuties wielding swords and kicking ass while trying to escape a whorehouse. I just don't think the little kiddies should be Sucker Puch-ed. My only real exception, as is true with any film dealing with similar subject matter, is the making light of pedophilia. This movie opens disturbingly with a dirty old man about to rape a young, preteen girl. Something of that nature has no business even being insinuated or associated with ensuing images clearly intended to titillate and peak the libido."

"fernandoschiavi","7","0","1","15 May 2020"," Zack Snyder proves all of his ability to build visually flawless scenes while corroborating his difficulties in telling a story with interesting characters
","Sucker Punch 'debuts as the first film based on an original concept by director Zack Snyder. The director even declared in interviews that the film is a kind of 'Alice in Wonderland with machine guns'. The talented director, responsible for the most interesting recent cinematic experiences of cinema such as Madrugada dos Mortos (2004), 300 (2006), Watchmen, O Filme (2009) and The Legend of Guardians (2010) bring us a different concept bringing a ""portrait"" stylized movement on the action and type of landscapes of the imagination and things of that nature "", in the director's own words.<br/><br/>Babydoll (Emily Browning) was admitted to a sanatorium by the unscrupulous stepfather, who ordered surgery to destroy her brain. But the young woman discovers that her refuge may be inside her mind and only then will she be able to be free forever. Now, living in this parallel world, she will face supernatural dragons, samurai, robots and Nazis, who will make her live a dangerous and fantastic adventure in the company of fellow inmates Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), Amber (Jamie Chung) and Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish). Was this your only chance for liberation?<br/><br/>The script written by Snyder himself along with Steve Shibuya is somewhat daring. Snyder could easily deliver a thought-provoking drama about the limits of sanity, madness, trauma, reality and fantasy, but he preferred to mix it all up with pure fantasy that becomes an allegory to all the protagonist's conflicts and dramas. These fantasies represent the sacrifices made by the girls in the sanatorium in search of the objects that will give Babydoll and her colleagues freedom: a map, fire, a knife, a key, and an undisclosed fifth element that would require a profound sacrifice, but would bring a perfect victory.
The film takes place on three different levels: the asylum where Babydoll is trapped, an imaginary version of this world where she is trapped in a brothel entertaining guests with dance numbers while her friends are prostituted and a third world of imagination, where the girl goes during their performances, in which the patients face their enemies wearing fetish clothes from the nerdy imaginary. In fact, the most interesting thing here is that although the sexualization of the female characters and the action scenes seem free at first glance, there are in the film a series of details and visual metaphors in the three levels of Babydoll's imagination that form a complete story. Some objects may appear in another way, some people may appear in another function, some situations may be metaphorized, but the three levels of consciousness tell the same story and complement each other in this idea. While Babydoll fights monsters to retrieve an essential escape item on the third level, she distracts the men around her with her dance so that her friends steal that object at the brothel level. The film never shows exactly how these men are distracted in the asylum, but it is suggested.<br/><br/>However, it is important to mention that the big problem is the connection we have with these characters because we do not perceive an emotional relationship between the characters, a dramatic arc for any of them or even a basis to justify the fantasies created by the protagonist. Without any explanation, she begins to imagine that she is in a kind of house where she still ""dreams"" of worlds as diverse as a war trench and a moving train about to explode a city. Where these illusions come from and what they represent remains a real mystery to the viewer. The script could work the fantasies as representations with some meaning, symbolizing the protagonist's psychological state, with her fears and fears. However, there is no sign of this. Was it just a random allegory that sought to represent the objects for the protagonist's freedom? Apparently, the intention seems to be just to create action scenes and spectacular random scenarios made in computer graphics that vaguely refer to objects, but that do not represent any attachment to the real world.<br/><br/>As if that were not enough, Snyder is unable to maintain coherence even in the crazy worlds he creates, since some heroines disappear without justification during missions and villains do not stop appearing when this seems appropriate to the script. But Snyder's lack of skill in narrative matters becomes glaring as he closes the film, completely changing the focus of the story, giving importance to a character who was, during the entire projection, nothing more than a supporting role in a desperate attempt by a brilliant plot twist, but in the end, it just becomes frustrating.<br/><br/>Unlike '300' in which warriors looked with their defined abs, here the protagonists are young and beautiful girls - with provocative names like Rocket, Sweet Pea and Bebydoll - exhibiting their physical attributes in minimal outfits, boasting, breaking, machine guns and swords while eliminating robots, Nazis and gigantic samurai. And Sucker Punch is exactly that: a youthful adventure that looks more like a huge video game, even with its well-defined phases. The various female protagonists seem wasted. Provenly talented actresses like Abbie Cornish and Jena Malone can do nothing but become representations of a youthful imaginary and, although they are all beautiful (the protagonist Emily Browning looks so beautiful in porcelain), this is not enough for the construction of interesting characters, by whom the audience will identify. Even an experienced actress like Carla Gugino seems lost, creating a questionable accent. In the case of the young protagonists, they all lack charisma and do not leave the viewer distressed with the destiny of each one thanks to the invulnerability in the fantastic world, since practically no creature offers real danger to them.<br/><br/>Even if it fails in its dramatic and narrative execution, it should be noted that the integration of the three worlds proved to be a poorly executed idea. However, in terms of aesthetics and visuals, 'Sucker Punch' is a very inspiring achievement. With an inspired photograph of Larry Fong, allied with the production designer Rick Carter, they are breathtaking scenery. All the fantastic scenarios are worth the investment of more than 80 million dollars in this production, like the temple in feudal Japan where Babydoll meets the Wise Man and then has to face three giant samurai, the bunker in World War I (map), the invasion of the orc-infested castle to recover two fire-producing crystals from inside a baby dragon (lighter), the train to fight robotic guards and defuse a bomb (knife). The art direction of Patrick Banister and Todd Cherniawsky also accompanies the impeccable technical quality of the film composing the cabaret and sanatorium scenery with every aspect of the 60s mixed with the aged dirt of the detonated plaster of the wall stained with rusty mirrors. The costume is marked by the beautiful and provocative fetish characterization of each character. The original track is composed of mixes and reinterpretations of some songs, including 'Where's My Mind', 'Army of Me', 'Love Is The Drug', 'Sweet Dreams' and 'Asleep', with these last two being sung by the protagonist Emily Browning.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder's shooting mode provides us with impressive visual compositions. The filmmaker again demonstrates undeniable talent in building beautiful shots, with incredible camera angles and movements. Still, Snyder has a clear tendency to excess when he shows the protagonist countless times dodging a blade in slow motion or when he films the girls falling to the ground in stylish poses.<br/><br/>'Sucker Punch' is definitely one of those 'love it or hate it' movies. It was not meant to be understood literally and it is never explained to the viewer, exactly why the internet is full of theories about what it really proposes to tell. Was it the story of a girl who escapes reality to deal with her traumas? Or a feminist metaphor? Which characters exist and which are only part of the fantasy? The certainty is that the film takes itself too seriously and harms itself, especially in the final act. Snyder, while far from being a visionary genius as many try to sell, is really capable of providing something outside of normal standards, even if only in terms of technique and style. In 'Sucker Punch', the director just proves all of his ability to build visually flawless scenes while corroborating his difficulties in telling a story with interesting characters. Still, the film is a unique visual experience that is worth watching. The work makes you question at all times about the worlds of dream and reality."
"haskellhello","7","0","1","10 May 2020"," Truly magnificent action-fantasy scenes that just barely stay grounded in a dark story
","I don't write a lot of reviews but I think this one is thorough and fair. It has no spoilers.<br/><br/>To say that Snyder used the confusing plot as an excuse to hit us with some of the best eye candy on the market would be a lie. There is definitely a story being told. Theres even reasons behind some of the confusing elements. Yet at the end of the day, it's just a little too hard to follow. For me the characters come across as underdeveloped, even though they DO show a LOT of emotion on screen. I think the film would've benefitted from a bit more quality small talk to make us fall in love with each character, which the film had almost none of. It makes sense though that every line had to be plot oriented when the biggest issue with a film like this is connecting the fantasy to the ""real"" storyline. I will say that the main female cast is nothing short of excellent both in the action and in the acting departments, and you will easily connect to them even without the exposition I wanted. You could totally argue that it's more realistic with how the characters interact with real emotion and they just don't explain why they are how they are because by the time we see the film they already know each other. That argument would be perfectly fair. The film probably just needed to be a little longer, and there's a good chance that the 18 minutes of extended footage in the Blu-ray cut make a big impact on the completeness of the experience. The fantasy sequences REALLY deliver, while the real world scenes feel like they don't get enough storytelling done. Seriously tho, the action is so damn good. Some of the camera work you just won't be able to find anywhere else, the slow-mo is used both generously and effectively, and the girls are incredibly acrobatic and absolutely ooze dramatic flair. It's bad ass. The real world plot feels like it takes too long to confusingly explain a simple plan. It was strange to me how the dialogue was often on the flat side, yet the narration at the end was so deep. The music is consistently bad ass and effectively adds to the atmosphere.<br/><br/>There were a couple moments where they failed to maintain ultra realism, like when a bad guy walks in on the gang plotting. Right after he leaves, 4-5 seconds later, they resume their full volume conversation. This vibe lingered throughout the movie too much and dropped it from 8 to 7 for me.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if you have a taste for things dark and bad ass AND you think you're pretty good at reading between the lines, this is 100% a must-see movie. The story really is there, it just takes a lot of effort to fully grasp with what's shown on screen. If you're a Shakespearean-style critic who only cares for intricate dialogue and thurough plot development, skip it. If you're an action junkie and love seeing hot girls twirling through the air shooting guns and swinging swords at often truly formidable foes in well-shot slow-mo, it should be on your bucket list. If you enjoy quality action portrayed with emotional actors, this is worth picking up."

","Nobody is demanding the Snyder cut for this, his most revealing film, a total exploration of the id that presents a dual world of women battling against, well, something while they're also being abused in what we're to assume is the more real of the two fake worlds. But throughout, it just looks like you're watching someone else play a video game and that's about as exciting as watching someone play a video game.<br/><br/>Yes, in this world, girls that are being used in a brothel and kept in an insane asylum prove their worth as women by jumping out of planes and battling robots while wearing fetish outfits. Surely it all means something, but it totally doesn't.<br/><br/>Snyder said, ""How can I make a film that can have action sequences in it that aren't limited by the physical realities that normal people are limited by, but still have the story make sense so it's not, and I don't mean to be mean, like a BS thing like Ultraviolet or something like that.""<br/><br/>Dude, you should be so lucky as to make something as incoherent as Ultraviolet.<br/><br/>Despite the film being as CGI as it gets, every one of the actresses spent twelve weeks training to get ready for it. That's right - six hours a day, five days a week, learning martial arts, how to deadlift 250 pounds, shoot firearms and look cool pole dancing, because, well, Zack Snyder.<br/><br/>This would have made a much better Fox Force Five origin story than a movie, trust me.<br/><br/>On one hand, Snyder has said that it's all about ""fetishistic and personal"" while he's also said that it's a critique of the way that geek culture objectifies women. By, you guessed it, objectifying women. Sure, they have big guns and swords, but they're missing that most crucial of all weapons: actual empowerment.<br/><br/>Let me try and make sense of this all.<br/><br/>At some point in the 60's, Babydoll (Emily Browning, The Uninvited) is placed in a Vermont mental institution by her stepfather, who has probably killed her mother and assaulted her sister. To add to that, he pays the asylum's Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac, way before he was Poe Dameron) to lobotomize her.<br/><br/>Babydoll then escapes into a world where she's a sex slave for Jones, who is now her pimp. She's joined by Amber (Jamie Chung, the most successful Real World cast member), Blondie (singer Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone, The Neon Demon) and her sister Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri). Dr. Gorski, who is the main doctor in the first world, is now the girl's dance instructor and is played by Carla Gugino (she was also in Snyder's Watchmen). Also - Babydolls virginity is about to be sold to a client played by Jon Hamm, which is totally how real life and prostitution looks and works.<br/><br/>But wait! There's another world where Scott Glenn shouts cliches at the girls while they battle giant Japanese samurai robots, dragons and a steampunk version of World War I.<br/><br/>The story ends with Glenn's character somehow coming into our world and the heroine getting lobotomized and nearly assaulted, which is some kind of paradise in one of these three worlds, I guess. But again, it's totally not.<br/><br/>It looks really cool though. Which is kind of Snyder's stock in trade. I have no idea who this is for, other than developmentally challenged men who can't get the women in the film, so they objectify them. It's kind of like the guys who defend and white knight girls that they pay $20 to see in their underwear on Patreon or onlyfans when guys demand they show more nudity. No one is friends here and this is all just a transaction. In the same way, this film says nothing, is nothing and desperately wants to be something - yet is as lofty as the cover versions of much better songs that it employs in some grasp for something, anything."

This film's script is dodgy, the plot is predictable, the acting is pretty mediocre, and it is a movie about hot chicks with guns targeted towards 15-19 year-olds.

And there are so many of them that they can ALMOST make up for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong: the story, dialogue, and acting could all have been considerably worse, but they could also have been much better. I am recommending this film, as it is definitely worth a viewing; just don't expect anything as deep as The Matrix. There are no deep characters to be found. The deepest this movie gets is an inch. There is no great acting (though there is some good acting), and not too much plot to speak of. What this movie has, and what it does well, is action. And there is LOTS of that. Granted, no film can stand up on only its action, which is, unfortunately, all this movie has left. But what action it is! Nazi zombies are sliced to pieces, blimps are shot down in slow-mo, and towering giants with miniguns are taken down by hot girls with skimpy clothes. It is, without a doubt, a stylish, badass piece of work. It's sad, actually, that the action scenes are the only ones where this genius shines through.<br/><br/>As has been discussed to death already, this is Zack Snyder's first film not based on some previously released product. And while his first attempt at true originality is a noble one, it is also, unfortuanately, misguided. Snyder does best when he already has a script to work with, a story that's already been told. He clearly does try here, and there are occasional glimpses of brilliance beneath the rest of the flaccid content of this film. There are elements of Inception, The Matrix, and Alice in Wonderland on display in this movie, and normally, one would want the strengths of all, and the faults of none. However, the unfortunate fact of the matter is that the reverse is usually the truth of this film."

the ending from when she helps her escape to right before the bus scene is great. but the bus scene at the very end just messes everything up, it really makes zero sense and just tries to be all connect-y. how is the bus driver the guy from her fantasies, and why is he randomly helping her like he knows her"

"AParkinson-2","9","0","1","26 June 2018"," The uncut review.
","This movie deserves its bad reviews and ratings for a few reasons. The main one being the uncut version is almost essential to make the movie plainly clear. I mean you could figure it out from the standard cut but the uncut is crystal. <br/><br/>It still would not make everyone happy because people hate it when a movie give them the finger (unless it is Deadpool and does it for comedy).<br/><br/>This movie is action porn in its most pure sense. The action is beautiful, well choreographed. The set pieces cover it all. You have your Japanese Samurai monsters with a big mini-gun, you have faceless steampunk Nazi's with a big mech robot boom boom boom. You then have knights and orcs and a dragon with a steampunk plane, finally futuristic train with evil i-robots and the old move along the train combat. A noble death, a bittersweet getaway. The bad guy loses, the good girl (baby) dies (kind of, see another nod to every Japanese Samurai movie ever when the main guy has to die). Mix in some music, tiny girls in skimpy gear and you have a soup of ""everything a teen boy wants to watch"". <br/><br/>And that is the point. This is what annoys people. This movie really has no point, but unlike others movies, this one shows you that. The rest still pretend they have substance. Total Recall (the real one) ends essentially with a 'then he woke up' flash in the sky (well a then he gets lobotomised) that we all buy. This is the same thing but we get offended.<br/><br/>I love it, and this is why I give it 9 stars. Not because I am smart. This all came from reading other reviews and then finally watching the uncut version. I hated the 5th Element the first time I saw it, but now its in my top then. This one also grows on you the more you watch it."

","Sucker Punch (2011): Dir: Zack Snyder / Cast: Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, Jamie Chung: Video game action film about survival. It stars Emily Browning as Baby Doll whose mother passed at a young age. She is sent to an institution when her stepfather murders her sister and frames her. She meets Rocket and her bold sister Sweet Pea as well as a slew of others. The place is run like a brothel for wealthy males for whom they dance for. Baby Doll mesmerizes them with her performance but she is really escaping through her mind where she is given instructions to her freedom. She is told that she needs particular items before freedom is met. The other girls decide to assist her in order to obtain the opportunity for freedom as well. Stylishly directed by Zack Snyder who previously made the underrated Watchmen as well as 300. Browning is dazzling. We never see her dance but her imagination is aflame with giants, dragons, and war zombies. It is unfortunate that the stepfather situation that landed her there is never solved but she remains strong. Abbie Cornish plays Sweet Pea who is reluctant to help Baby Doll but she ends up being to strongest willed of them all. Jena Malone as Rocket is Sweet Pea's younger sister. She is saved by Baby Doll when the cook attempts to rape her. She will understand later what sacrifice is all about. Vanessa Hudgens as Blondie becomes a snitch but her handling is too abrupt. Finally there is Jamie Chung as Amber who performs her own dance for the mayor when his lighter needs lifted. Our imagination aids us and sucker punches viewers with exquisite visual mind screw.

The film features a series of lovingly crafted fantasy sequences set in worlds inspired by Lord of the Rings, the Matrix, steampunk culture and Japanese manga.<br/><br/>The framing device for these sequences, however, is a problem. A young girl, nicknamed Babydoll (Emily Browning) is wrongfully imprisoned at an asylum that turns out to be a brothel that exploits her and other girls who are similarly fraudulently incarcerated. Her escape plan involves performing (implied) erotic dances that captivate and distract all onlookers for several minutes while a group of her fellow captives collect the plot tokens they need. While dancing, Babydoll distracts herself from her own shame and degradation by escaping into the fantasy worlds described above, transposing her aims as 'missions', mostly of an aggressive kind, performed by her 'team' of fellow captives, now transformed into badass warriors clad in costumes with classically fetishistic connotations: schoolgirls, sailors and soldiers of the past and future.<br/><br/>No matter how I look at this, it's not good. The most charitable interpretation is that Snyder is trying to 'sucker punch' us by luring us into escapism and then hitting us all the harder with the harsh reality; a form of social commentary. However, my conscience refused to let me be lured away, and indeed I rather resent the implication that I can be distracted so easily. The grimness of the 'real world' soured the fantasy for me.<br/><br/>A worse interpretation is that Snyder didn't care, that he thought it was okay for Babydoll to be treated like meat, because she has somewhere cool to escape to. Or at least, that it doesn't matter because it's all just cool stuff passing in front of our eyes for a couple of hours, so it might as well be REALLY cool stuff.<br/><br/>It's such a shame, because the fantasy sequences are simply stunning, and I am sure I would have greatly enjoyed the whole if they had found a framing device that wasn't so damn creepy..."
"sergio-arauzo","6","0","3","30 August 2014"," Unusual film: Love it or hate it, but must watch it.
","This film has very good points: the music, the stenography, the multiple realities approach, Scott glen and Jena Malone. It has very bad points, too, like the main character, Emily browning, anything but an action films actress, who performs horrible in combat choreography. Combat scenes have plenty of special effects, but awful choreography. Do not expect something like Milla Jovovich combat performance. The plot is much more complex than you could expect at first, so if you are looking for some empty, girls with guns, combat movie you will be very disappointed (for instance, if you go to watch the movie because of you like the movie promos and posters). I think the best of this movie is the mix of reality with bizarre action scenes, pretty photography, very adequate music, and some touches of pulp fiction, kill bill and other Tarantino productions. Should you go to watch this movie? I think the answer is YES. Even if you do not like it as a hole you will enjoy, as I have said, good music, nice photography and an unusual production."

She is abused and sent off to a mental institute for the death of her sister (which she didn't do). While there she starts getting these visions that she is a dancer in a brothel. Her mission is to escape with some of the other girls and find the freedom she is looking for.<br/><br/>The story is very confusing at times and not easy to follow. It was OK in the end when it explained itself, but it was still not a very strong story.<br/><br/>The effects were not great. Some of it was very good, but at other times it felt like I was watching a computer game. It could have been better. There were times where I thought that it was good... some of the ""dream"" characters were really well done. I liked the way that when some of the soldiers got killed, steam came out of the wound instead of blood. I thought that was different and looked great.<br/><br/>The acting was average at best. There were some actors who did a good job, but others just seemed bad. The movie starred Emily Browning as Babydoll. Unfortunately I thought she did a bad job. She was not very convincing and her fighting scenes looked uncomfortable. Other cast members were Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgensï»¿, Jamie Chung, Carla Gugino and Oscar Isaac. Oscar was the best actor in this by far. He was creepy and horrible and played it really well.<br/><br/>It looked like all the girls that were there to kick some butt, just didn't have it in them. You could tell these girls felt like they couldn't do it and the fighting scenes suffered because of it.<br/><br/>I don't think this film deserves the bad wrap it got.

"rdvljunk","8","0","1","4 May 2013"," absolutely confusing
","I do like movies in which reality gets mixed up and so I also came to see this one. And as many others I'm totally confused after watching it; It is an amazing spectacle but is it total garbage or is it a great movie, I really do not know. The absolute weird things of the movie, like the casting of apparently botoxed Emily Browning as baby doll, seems to be a big mistake, but on the other side it fits very well because the movie is in many cases so totally overdone, like the imagery which sometimes reminds of a music video clip and often focuses on details, the bizarre soundtrack, the acting. So then I came to the conclusionit must have been on purpose and the movie is more a parody on the sexy girls with weapons movies then it tries to fit in. So depending on what you expected in this movie you will be either disappointed or flabbergasted. If like movies that confuse you, it is a recommendation. If you want a simplistic mindless evening, better avoid it."
"Restharrow","6","0","1","21 September 2012"," Concept is brilliant... but lazy plot construction.
","Personally, I think the concept is simply brilliant, yet completely left out to dry... Why? Well, I understand that at some points of writing the plot, there are some huge holes that are left to be filled with brainstorm ideas that come after everything. I believe these parts could have been thought through a lot better. <br/><br/>First of all, the 'world' they live in switches thrice, the asylum, then the dancing world, then the war world. When the dancing started as the war 'transition' did, I felt banging my head so hard against a table. Maybe they thought it was cool or whatever, but I think it's such a boring way to shortcut through a supposed 'intense' scene of when their going through the most intense moments. And the hypnotizing dance? God! Talk about the biggest upperhand in the world! <br/><br/>This movie could have been my favorite ever (based on the concept) but the plot tanked, yet I still enjoyed it. Reasons? The music was brilliant! CONCEPT. The graphics were spectacular! The starting -EPIC- and the ending -loved it!<br/><br/>So do I hate it? Can't. Do I love it? Can't. It's not bad. It's not incredible.

","I'll say this first, as someone who majored in game and animation, the graphics were great, but I honestly couldn't stand watching the fight scenes. I really was bored and I would start doing other things as the fight scenes went on and on and on. As great as the graphics were in those scenes, they just seemed so random and irrelevant to the story. The dragons were awesome, but why use dragons? Each scene didn't mesh well into the next. <br/><br/>I had no idea whatsoever about what this movie was about, so I had no expectations prior to watching it. It was interesting to a point and I know they were definitely trying to do something different with the story and concept, but so many things were just lacking to pull it all together to really make it a good film. I mean you can't add a bunch of random awesome stuff that would be perfectly fine individually, the key word here is individually, and expect them to come together to make sense when jam packed into one story. 'Cause it wont. Ohhh man, it wont.<br/><br/>TIP: If you want to take away some useful knowledge after reading my review, here's a suggestion - if you seek a REALLY great mental asylum lobotomy prostitute fantasy world story, I have one title for you. American McGee's Alice. It is based on Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, except it is very twisted. Look up the summary on the Alice wikia and maybe play the games because you will get so much more than the story in this movie. <br/><br/>The alternate reality in the games actually co-relates to the story and have profound metaphors, *spoilers ahead from the game American McGee's Alice: Madness Returns* ...ie: the master villain ""Dollmaker"" producing and selling dolls that keep appearing throughout her alternate world - little kids getting their heads drilled and being sold off as nothing more than blank ""toys"" to creeps in reality. You end up having to fight only his ""hands"" in the end because they were what he used to defile kids. There really wasn't much thought behind choosing the fight scenes in Sucker Punch - they were random. Yes the movie has its metaphors, but they were weak. If you think otherwise and say Sucker Punch is complex, etc, I challenge you to at least play American McGee's Alice: Madness Returns. After you do that, re-think the word complex and how you've been using it up until now. I shouldn't even be comparing the two since they are on totally different levels. The stories aren't the same, but there are similar concepts between them, just enough so that it makes me want others to read about it/play it rather than watch Sucker Punch. <br/><br/>I know there is a difference between a game and a movie, but even if you shorten the game up, it'll still be way more creative and deep. Whenever they get back to producing American McGee's Alice into a movie, I'll be all over that. Instantly."
"rus_ty","5","0","2","17 August 2012"," Chicks, guns, explosions and warriors... Well, it sounded good...
","There is no denying that Zack Snyder is a very visionary director. If anyone has seen his graphic novel styled movies 300 and Watchmen, it's clear to see where his profession is. To dazzle the eyes of his viewers which he does incredibly well every time. But his story telling is where things begin to flop. <br/><br/>Yes, the visuals in Sucker Punch are amazing. We have sword wielding, guns blasting, explosions going off, great big fire breathing dragons, planes in the sky, battlefields, chicks slaying stuff everywhere, but do I see a story anywhere? Beyond all that marvellous CGI, surely there must be a story? No, there isn't. Even the makers of this film got lost in the wonders of the pointless action that kept getting rammed down our throats to a point where it just became BORING. Sure, seeing chicks smash crap up and slay bad guys is fun at first, but after a while it gets to repetitive that gets you asking: ""Okay, can we see some story now?""<br/><br/>Sucker Punch revolves around the character Babydoll, who accidentally shoots and kills her sister when in self defence of her abusive step father. She is sent to a mental institution for girls, where she is joined by her ""comrades"" Sweet Pea, Amber, Blondie, and Rocket. Although the place is meant to be a mental institution, it seems more like a strip club the way the girls are treated by the man who runs the place. The acting of the five girls are very bland, all the lines are said with no emotion and they all just seem very wooden acted and two dimensional. Sure, they pull it off in the battles and action scenes, because all they have to do is scream and shoot things and blow things up which, let's be honest, even the worst actors can do. Even Emily Browning, who did a great role in A Series of Unfortunate Events, was sadly a disappointment in this.<br/><br/>Now, Babydoll has no intention of staying in the institution. She dreams up a pretend world filled with dragons and warriors and Nazi zombies, where she is told she has to collect four items so she can escape the institution. Seeing as all the action takes place in their crazy messed up heads, I can't see how any of it matters to us. Sure, seeing Emily Browning battle three massive Samurai Warriors is fun and exciting at first, but then we drift further and further from the real world and more into this dream world that a ten year old would create if he was bored in math class. We've all been there.<br/><br/>Yes, all the girls are insane, why else would they imagine all the battle sequences that happen so repeatedly? But Sucker Punch, believe it or not, started out promising, for about 10 minutes. It had to potential to actually be a good movie, but the more and more action sequences and CGI they throw into one scene, the storyline just gets thinner and thinner and eventually disappears where we don't care what happens to the characters anymore. <br/><br/>Sucker Punch will, without doubt, dazzle you with its visuals and mindless action. It could be fun with a bunch of mates, if all you want to see is chicks and robots and dragons with some booze. But if you're after a serious story with well developed characters and a storyline that stays strong all the way through, then I'd give it a miss.<br/><br/>CGI sequences= Stunning, 10/10<br/><br/>Story and characters= 3/10"
"TheGrayed","5","0","2","31 July 2012"," Great start, acceptable plot, absolutely irrelevant action scenes.
","First 5 minutes, is the best start that I've ever seen in movies. But as plot expands, and specially when action scenes get involved, you kind of feel this is not the movie that such beginning deserves. I think using that type of action was absolutely pointless and very wrong since it damaged drama atmosphere drastically. But if you just cut out action scenes, without any further edit, you'd have a way better movie. And not just better, but a great one. I guess action was forcibly injected in Sucker Punch's plot only to complete the money attracting elements of sexuality and violence. As final word, first 5 minutes is worth seeing over and over. Rest of the movie, not so bad to see once. But if you ever wanted to watch it again, be sure to skip all action scenes."

","Many people have asserted that this is a love it or hate it movie, but I disagree. I didn't really have very strong feelings about it either way, though certain aspects of it left me with vaguely positive or vaguely negative feelings.<br/><br/>There are two ways to interpret this movie. The first is as a tale of female empowerment, with multiple layers of symbolism, amazing CG and breathtaking stunts. The other way is a series of pointless and gratuitous video game cutscenes with half naked girls, who have no personality or backstory. There's an element of truth to both interpretations, though I think the female empowerment is akin to the 1990s-era ""girl power"" movement. This faux feminism says that girls can do whatever they want, as long as it titillates men and doesn't upset the social order. While some people may find empowerment in this, I find it a bit cynical and too watered down.<br/><br/>Like Michael Bay, Tony Scott, and Ryuhei Kitamura, I think teenage boys who care more about style than substance are always going to be his main demographic.

","Strange title, unless it references the groin kick now way overused, then also a wacky mixture of Political Correctness. The plot has it both ways in that the preadolescent boys get to enjoy looking at the mild female costumes and to watch them cry and suffer. At the same time, the plot asserts ""girl power"" to rise up again oppressing men. The girls are dancing girls/whores EMPLOYED by sadistic controllers (implying they could just quit) who nevertheless have them locked in the back stages. Typically confused ""kitchen sink"" script that struggles to be another PULP FICTION and fails in cliques and just stupid inter-cutting between time lines/imaginary alternate character-imagined scenes. Made for 13 year olds' minds with simplistic plot and characters. Boys will like to oogle and dream of owning a girl and the girls in the audience can study a ""hooker look"" and enjoy being dominated and forced to do what they want to do anyway. But, Hollywood computer graphics geeks do give ""oh wow"" to the visuals."
"nvjs","5","0","1","28 June 2012"," Snyder's ""cult"" film
","After watching this flick, maybe sometime into it, you may get the feeling that Snyder made this film simply to fill in his time between projects. I remember reading about him making this film as saying; ""...I wondered about why couldn't a film be made that encompassed all these cool effects and martial arts without any regard to propriety."" To me, that sounds like what Michael Bay's philosophy towards his films is all about. Sucker Punch I think is Snyder's attempt of making a ""cult film/art film"" ou of his own material and that is reminiscent of those '70's films like ""Two-Lane Blacktop"" and ""Vanishing Point"" where there was no real rhyme or reason to the whole movie. I think it's Snyder's ""Existential"" film. What never made sense to me about Babydoll, was that when she embarked on her ""Matrix Moment"", her other ditzy friends followed and strangely, in her head whatever they suffered in the ""Matrix Moment"", translated to their reality. This made no sense whatsover. But then I remembered Snyder's rationale behind the reason for the film. That it didn't need to make sense! Disappointing of all, was the way the characters stood out from the greenscreen and it simply looked like doing a karate exhibition in front of the audience at a theatre. Using the screen as a crude ""forced perspective"". Above all, was that Snyder was eager to move from one action sequence to the next but doing that would just make the film 45 minutes long. So we get unnecessary dialogue scenes that are supposed to give us Exposition and emotion which comes off as forced and redundant."

I felt like I was watching a video game the whole time. And I don't play video games.Although there are some good actors in this film, I did not like their acting in it.It may have something to do with the directing? There was a lot of over acting. I loved the music, but it did not help the movie be any easier to watch.It is true, I did question myself why? Why does this movie get on my nerves so much? I wanted to like it. I love loony bin movies, but this, was just too much. There are some very elaborate CGI, but that may have been part of my problem with this film. I can say that it was beautiful, but that is what made me think of a video game. During the scenes involving them, the CGI took over and replaced actors. It was like they were trying to save their budget by doing this. It did not do well at the box office, and it barely broke even. I am old school, and I do not like graphics to replace actors. Although talent on the graphic engineer's side, it is weak everywhere else. So, the only good things I can say about the movie is the soundtrack, which features the lead actress, Emily Browning,singing on quite a few tracks and the CGI, although not the artist's fault who was hired to do the CGI, it made me like the movie less, as I said earlier, I found it hokey. Weak production values andbad acting. I could not sit through it again."

The story jumps from one story at the beginning, to a second at the hospital, to a third with a dance, to a fourth with another dance. Each dance dream sequence is epically apart. The first is like WWII with zombies and steam punk, whilst the second is WWII with lord of the rings element mix. This throws the viewer around like a pinball.

I love action flick movies and I love it more if the leads are bad ass women. I endured 30 minutes of watching the film intently but when the action scenes were only shown when the freakin' girl started to dance, all of my interest were thrown out the window. I understood what they want the characters to do or what they had to change or obtain. I just don't get why they had to show it through imaginary fighting scenes. The action scenes don't make sense. It was rather a distraction.<br/><br/>It seems that the producers were thorn between creating a dramatic- disturding-film or an action-sci-fi-flick so they decided to mix both and the result was awesomely disastrous.<br/><br/>The main character's acting didn't even help.

","When I saw this movie, I loved it. The strange and exotic fantasy realms, the frame tell style, the action, and the idea. It just wasn't pulled off nearly as well as it could have been. Some of the actors were pretty weak. I think Emily Browning may have been the only decent performer, although the gentlemen who played Blue and The Wise Man were just fine. The other secondary rolls made the movie feel cheesy and cheap. This was exacerbated by some moments of crumby dialogue. This could have easily been a 9 out of ten with a script tune up and some better supporting actresses. Oh and one more thing, (Actually I really disliked that repeated line) I think that a little more focus on the asylum and/or her home would have been good too."

"mistabobdobolina","6","0","3","6 September 2011"," Much better than I was expecting
","I haven't been hugely impressed by Snyder in the past, and so I wasn't expecting much when I rented Sucker Punch. But this is definitely a movie that -- while not exactly Citizen Kane -- deserved better reviews on average than it got.<br/><br/>My theory about why that is: the movie was typically advertised as being built around a young girl's ""escape"" into her vivid imagination from her Dickensian horror of a life. Some reviewers, aside from apparently not having paid attention to the relationships between the different layers of the film's Russian doll plot, were understandably squicked by the notion that Snyder was portraying a girl ""escaping in her imagination"" into a brothel, with schoolgirl persona intact. (And thence into a series of apparently incoherent fight sequences introducing video game style by a seemingly random mentor character.) But Sucker Punch isn't about escape at all. The characters aren't ""escaping"" the Dickensian asylum of the film's opening for the ""better"" world of a brothel; rather, the brothel setting is a *literalization* of what's going on in the asylum. Likewise, the fight sequences aren't escape; they're a *literalization* of the life-and-death struggle over desire that surrounds the body, especially the female body. As a storytelling device, this makes sense and is actually quite clever. It's also, of course, an excuse for sexploitation filmmaking, and Snyder doesn't dance around that in the least... but I was pleasantly surprised to see there was a lot more going on than just the sexploitation.<br/><br/>There are also (in another nice surprise) a lot of really good performances here. The evil orderly / brothel-keeper is a very good villain, the nurse / madame character is ably-rendered, and the team of girls features acting talent ranging from the passably blank in the case of Babydoll (all that character needs) to the solid work that goes into Sweetpea and Rocket. Even some of the bit parts stand out more strikingly than that sort of thing normally does in Snyder's work.<br/><br/>Oddly, the biggest drawback is that the fight sequences themselves -- played out against hordes of faceless robotic opponents and pounding soundtracks -- turned out to be oddly weak. They're a good idea and provide some welcome relief from the unrelieved darkness of the film's other layers, and it's made clear that they're present to symbolize the very different kinds of conflict that are ""really"" happening, but in and of themselves they feel curiously empty despite all the frenetic action and explosions. Where real drama intrudes, as with Rocket's self-sacrifice, it does so because other layers of the plot have supplied it.<br/><br/>Still, not a bad film at all."

","SPOILER ALERT!!<br/><br/>In all honesty, this movie was one out of a dozen with decent CG. Now that's out the way, sitting throughout this movie was a big waste of my time and I hope you won't take the same route I did.<br/><br/>First - The plot of the movie didn't have one damn thing to do with the medieval, martial arts and Nazi styled war fighting scenes. If you asked me, they were pretty unnecessary in every way possible. I mean the medieval scene was basically 'Lord of the Ring' in 5 minutes. The manager or ""Boss"" of the mental home in my opinion tried too hard to seem like a bad guy. He didn't have the looks for one, his acting was horrifying and I wasn't moved by him at all.<br/><br/>LET ME GET TO THE OVERLY USED SLOW MOTION OF THE FILM, I swear at least 32 times, something was used in slow motion matrix. I felt like I was watching a snail kick ass. From the sweater button early in the movie to the bullets flying around the train, I was going to sucker punch someone in the face.<br/><br/>On to the actresses. If I had a nickle for every time there was a close up shot of boobs jiggling, ass in fish nets, and high heels in this movie, I would be semi rich. The director, or producer obviously wanted extremely hot girls with a little bit of fighting style ( Mind you, those fighting skills came from NOWHERE) to attract horny men or occasionally women.<br/><br/>Watching this, I thought to myself about how many horny teenagers, boys and girls enjoyed the skimpy dresses female actresses. I mean movies nowadays has the following, sex craved teens, 3d, sex, hot slow females, slow jocks, super heroes or just plain awful remakes.<br/><br/>I said all I needed to say about this so called movie."

","""A special effect is a tool; a means of telling a story. A special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing."" – George Lucas.<br/><br/>I'll let that soak in for a quick second. Friday night marked the start of a great Belgian beer festival near a new (to me) Regal theater. I had a few awesome beers with my wife and then, feeling pretty good, we went to see the movie. Unfortunately for us there was also a crack-head seeing the movie and he was feeling pretty good (read: chatty) too.<br/><br/>Back to Mr. Lucas. While he has proved his own point with episodes one through three, I generally disagree. I love movies like District B:13 and Day After Tomorrow. They are characterized by a lack of plot and lots of great action/visual effects. It's craft beer for the eyeballs. Sucker Punch's trailer promised viewers two things: boobies and action with the possibility of some of the decent storytelling that Zack Snyder has exhibited in the past. It was the story of a girl in a mental hospital that reverts into this war-like inner world in order to deal with that is going on around her. Escape from a crazy nazi-fueled dream. I am behind this film in a big way.<br/><br/>What I failed to notice from the trailer was the mental world in-between the crazy house and the crazy nazi world. The time where she imagines herself trapped in a cabaret/brothel makes up a good 80% of the film. This world is not filled with action or much sexy. It's just a lot of overly dramatic girls making broad statements about freedom, self, and how everything is impossible or not. The crack-head vocally approved whenever something touched his drugged up soul. ""I lost everyone I loved. And then they locked me away. With no where to hide from the pain,"" Baby Doll says. ""Mmm, yes. That's right,"" the crack-head says. Story and sexy fail.<br/><br/>Visually the portions of the film set in the nazi world were beautiful, but very sterile. I never thought I'd complain about something being too stylized, but Hollywood has a way of pushing the envelope. These scenes also made up about 12 minutes total from the film. Action promise fail.<br/><br/>This film had such potential. It was disturbingly honest about what most movie watchers want to see. I would applaud Snyder for his bait- and-switch, but I think he just failed at making the sexy action film he really wanted. And just to ruin your day a little more: the next Superman is also the next film in Snyder's downward trajectory.<br/><br/>At least it spoke to the crack-head."

"brando647","7","0","1","15 August 2011"," It Should've Just Been a Video Game
","Zack Snyder has never given me reason to doubt him. He's created some of the coolest movies in recent years and, with SUCKER PUNCH, he's finally gotten around to creating a wholly original (though obviously heavily influenced) film. It's a fast-paced, sexy action collage with a paper-thin plot tying it all together. After the accidental murder of her younger sister, a young girl (known only as Baby Doll) is committed to a mental asylum by her corrupt father in an attempt to keep her silent as he steals her inheritance. The father forms a deal with a shady orderly to organize a lobotomy in mere days that will ensure Baby Doll is no longer a threat. In the asylum, Baby Doll begins to imagine the place as an elaborate brothel run by the abusive Blue Jones. Baby Doll falls in with a group of orphans and runaways (Sweet Pea, Rocket, Amber, & Blondie) and formulates a plan to escape using her hypnotic dance to distract while her friends gather the supplies they need. Baby Doll dives into fantastic imaginary worlds where she and her team battle evil forces in a desperate attempt to escape their imprisonment.<br/><br/>It really is a strange story, with fantasy worlds inside fantasy worlds. Unfortunately, the story itself is the movie's weak point. Snyder has proved in the past that he's an incredible visual storyteller with a unique style and he proves it yet again here with amazing fantasy sequences where Baby Doll and her team are thrown into incredible sequences battling a fire-breathing dragon, steam-powered zombie Nazis, and more. The action in this film is spectacular with vivid worlds and adrenaline-soaked battles and plenty of Snyder's beloved slow-motion. When I watch this movie, I can't help but feel like I should be holding a controller. This movie is more of a feature-length video game than a proper narrative film. In a way, it's even divided into individual stages, each with its own objective and the brothel scenes playing out like narrative cut scenes. The fantasy/action sequences are boosted with some killer music setting the mood, including star Emily Browning's haunting vocals in a version of the Eurythmics' ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"" and a wicked cover of Jefferson Airplane's ""White Rabbit"". The soundtrack in this movie is definitely one of the best this year.<br/><br/>Well, action's not necessarily enough to carry a film on it's own so SUCKER PUNCH has the added bonus of mind-blowing sex appeal. Emily Browning is gorgeous as a the blond Baby Doll, often sporting a school girl outfit in her fantasies as she's taking on stone samurai or slicing through a horde of orcs. Whenever she's on screen, she's impossible to take your eyes off of. Her team is rounded out by the beautiful Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Jamie Chung, and Vanessa Hudgens (all grown up from her Disney Channel days, apparently). Carla Gugino has a supporting role sporting a Polish accent as Dr. Gorski, the voice of compassion in an otherwise dreary life for these girls. Oscar Isaac is the film villain, Blue Jones. I've never heard of Isaac before now but he does well as the volatile...pimp? I suppose you could call him that. Regardless, he makes a cool villain for the piece. There's plenty of awesome characters here, but they don't matter as much here as the gunfights and swordplay. It's a shame, too. I wanted Syder's first original piece to stand out as much as his previous films, but the fact that he sacrificed an intriguing story and strong characters for women in skimpy outfits flying mechs and firing huge guns turned a lot of people (both critics and audiences) off. Wait, women in skimpy outfits...massive guns...what was the problem again?"

I THINK that the filmmakers WANTED us to (or at least hoped we would) sympathize with or, at minimum, empathize with the main character, but not only was she totally psychotic & delusional, what little of her character that WAS actually shared with us wasn't even particularly Likable! :( Similarly her comrades weren't the most likable characters EITHER! <br/><br/>From the time the previews began airing on TV, I SO wanted to see this movie! And, to be honest, (contrary to how I may sound in this review) I REALLY WANTED to like this movie! However, at the end of the day, I simply could not. I'm not even entirely sure which demographic this movie might even begin to appeal to! (shrug) MAYBE to males who like T&A and lots of action But, I mean, come on, you can get that in your typical action movie and still get a plot and likable (at least bearable) characters in the process!"
"SiamakZ","Null","0","3","16 July 2011"," Too much eye candy and too little focus on the story itself
","For this review, I've watched the extended edition. Snyder's put too much emphasis on visuals and over the top action scenes... Although the story is nice to begin with, after a while it seems the whole quest and fantasies are taking over. The first time it's kinda fresh and exciting, but it grows old real fast. Snyder has borrowed heavily from other sources, such as Killzone. Actually, the whole movie plays like a watered-down video game. But just like the girls in teeny skirts, it's all eye candy and very superficial. I had high hopes for this movie, especially being a fan of Snyder's previous work (300 and Watchmen). But unfortunately, this one falls short and gets the stamp mindless action flick."
"paul-576-228065","6","0","3","8 July 2011"," Inception Punch with Steampunk Zombies
","In Sucker Punch, you get the impression that Zak Snyder wanted to make a kick-ass movie with hot chicks in schoolgirl uniforms fighting steampunk zombies. And at that level, it really works - the fight sequences are nothing short of awesome. Crank up the surround sound for those.<br/><br/>But where the film gets annoying is the half-arsed way that he justifies the action - it really makes no sense; and if you can't get past that illogic and just embrace the aaaawesomeness of the action, this film will not work for you.<br/><br/>The story: 'Baby Doll' (played by Aussie actress Emily Browning, who you might remember from 'Lemony Snickets'), in a stylised, graphic novel inspired sequence at the start, is institutionalised by her depraved stepfather, who covets the estate of her recently deceased mother. In a further lurch into depravity, he bribes a turnkey at the the 'Institute for the Totally, Like, Insane' to schedule Baby Doll for a lobotomy - in Five Days Time.<br/><br/>Here's where it gets all 'Inception'; for some reason, Baby Doll flips into an alternate vision of the institution as a faux-Twenties speakeasy/flophouse (that still boasts a photocopy machine); and when she is asked to dance, she morphs AGAIN into the really cool Matrix world where she and her vixenish compatriots do incredible deeds, mentored by a mysterious father figure played by Scott Glenn.<br/><br/>A flimsy premise is then constructed that gives the rest of the film some structure, in the same way that classic porn movies feature a visitation from a pizza guy to drive the story; Baby Doll and the Hot Kickass Vixens must gather unto themselves four items to help them escape before the date of Baby Doll's lobotomy. In the flophouse world - one level down - this is represented as the visit of the High Roller (played by Jon Hamm, reveling in antagonist rolls between 'Mad Men' seasons), who will deflower Baby Doll.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder's previous notable efforts (300, Watchmen) had solid scripts behind them, garnered from equally high-quality graphic novels; this movie shows us that he's not much of a writer, at least relating to plot and structure. But what he does well, he does really well, and it is the cool visuals and spot-on classic pop remixes backing the action, that punches this movie up beyond complete mediocrity.<br/><br/>Thankfully, his next movie, 'Man of Steel', has been penned by the same guys behind the critically and commercially successful 'Batman' reboot; Chris Nolan (whoah, Inception again) and David S. Goyer. Let's see if he can redeem himself there; I'm hopeful."

","Things I like: 1. The story. Theoretically a good plot. Part drama, part horror, part RPG, and part super hero movie. 2. The visuals. Each shot is stunning. The art direction is spectacular. From costumes, to sets, and special effects....all of it was fantastic. 3. The music. Each song serves as a narration and fuels the story and emotion for each scene. Covers can easily become over the top, cheesy, and outright awful (especially if done by the lead actress in attempt to spark a music career), however this was not the case. Emily Browning is actually a great singer, and manages to nail these songs beautifully. However, I don't know about the musical number during the credits. That came out of left field for me, especially after that ending. It was weird.<br/><br/>Things I don't like: 1. The plot. I know...its the first thing on my list of likes...but its here too. I get the whole girl power aspect that they keep preaching ...but, realistically...its not. I mean, she WAS lobotomized and WAS being taken advantage of, right? Being so effed up that you create alternate realities in your mind to survive it is NOT a thing of empowerment. It's sad and tragic. You can dress her like Sailor Moon all you want, but at the end of the day, shes locked away in a mental institution and lobotomized. 2. The acting. This is partly due to the ridiculous dialogue. Emily Browning wasn't too bad...although very one note and had the same expression on her face no matter what was happening. The rest of the cast was just awful. Usually, I like Jenna Malone. However in this movie, I think I laughed every time she delivered a line. Vanessa Hudgens was just a meh of nothing with Snooki hair. Jamie Chung and Vanessa Hudgens' characters didn't even need to exist really. I had higher hopes for Abbie Cornish since I've liked her in other movies and think she's a decent actress, but here...she was flat and again, I pretty much laughed at every one of her lines. Again, I think it was just bad writing....but it almost seems as if it was intentional. 3. The every-other-shot-is-slow-mo craziness. If it were a drinking game...you'd be dead by the end of the movie. Do not try it please. It was over kill by the end. It was so much slow-mo that it was absurd. I almost felt like I was being ""sucker punched"" every time it happened. There was slow-mo when it wasn't even necessary. The movie is 10 minutes short of 2 hrs. With that much slow-mo, it felt like 4. And lastly, number 4. I actually rooted for the dragon. When she nudges her dead baby.....that moment was the most emotionaly invested I felt through the whole movie. That shouldn't have been the case. Zack Snyder, you have to make people care if your characters live or die. A hint of empathy or consideration at the very least....not have your audience root for the characters to be eaten by the dragon so they'd stfu!!!<br/><br/>So there it is. I like it and I don't. I don't regret buying it. So that says something, I guess."

","Every art major should watch this movie. Visually, it's stunning. The scenes are meticulously crafted, beautifully orchestrated. Much like watching Pageant of the Masters in hyper speed; and with about as much of a plot. Please Zack Snyder, hire Paul Haggis to write an actual screenplay for your next movie. I would love to see the beauty on screen represent more than a flat canvas of eye candy. Give us substance and depth in the story to make us care about the characters. Emily Browning does a great job with the script she has to work with. With a small amount of dialogue she conveys abject sadness, despair, downright misery, and eventually works her way up to confusion, resolution, and focused determination. We see a fragment of her back story, but nothing of the other girls' stories, making it extremely difficult to understand why they are in this place and what their roles are in this made up world, presumably taking on the same roles they hold in relation to each other in the real world. Except for Abbie Cornish and Jenna Malone the others are interchangeable. With a movie this stunningly crafted I want to sit back and enjoy the display, but I also want to care about who I'm watching on screen. Spend a little more time on the why's and how's of the characters' stories and the audiences will care enough to come back."

","SUCKER PUNCH – CATCH IT for (Production Value/Fights/Graphics/Oscar Isaac) & TRASH IT for (Idiotic concept of all time) ( C+ ) Sucker Punch starts with a girl (BabyDoll) losing her mother and in attempt to save her sister from step-father she kills her younger sister and end up in mental asylum. Now the plot is simple that BabyDoll tries to escape from mental institution along with 4 other trapped girls. Now, Sadly Mr. Snyder used his own mind to make it like a blow up ""Michael Bay Bayhem"". His BabyDoll goes into a fantasy world at her lobotomy that ""she is a dancer/prostitute"" in a club, now she is trying to escape from this club along with other 4 trapped dancers. BabyDoll fantasies another fantasy world in which she was told that she has to have 5 things to get out of club (Map, Fire, Knife, Key & SPOILER (herself). First of all, why a 20years old girl thinks that she is a prostitute and trapped in a club rather than a psychopath trapped in mental asylum. That's just utterly weird. Secondly, she goes into another imagination in her imagination, I think Snyder was applying the Inception effect over here but it didn't work at all. We can accept that instead of in dirty clothes and dirty mental asylum Babydoll thinks she is in a Club in beautiful dresses and whatever happened in her fantasy club is happening in mental asylum. But we can't image how she goes into another imagination and fights Giant Monsters, Shadow Armies, Dragons and Robots. That's where it spoils everything. The only made me go through all this craziness was the graphics, fights and production value. There is no doubt that somehow studios believed on Snyder weird concept and spend around 80million dollars on this movie with bunch of girls in skimpy clothes fighting and dancing. Emily Browning was perfect as BabyDoll. No doubt she looks stunning but she doesn't have many dialogues and when she gets some it wasn't very convincing. Abbie Cornish (Sweet pea) along with Jena Malone (Rocket) are the only girls who stood out as an actresses, I have seen Abbie and hear about her from time to time but this is the first time I'll remember her and would love to see what she brings to Madonna's W.E. Vanessa Hudgens was awful. She has been good as teen in HSM movies but as an Adult she disappointed again after Beastly. Jaime Chung was okay. Carla Gugina was really good. Oscar Isaac is a star to watch out. I was highly impressed by him in Agora & Robin Hood and now its delight to see what he brings to Sucker Punch. He was some of the good things in the movie. Overall, Sucker Punch is a Sucker, but if you like the Punches & can surpass the idiotic story of all time. It's bearable."
"bobblablog","Null","0","3","30 June 2011"," Call me a Sucker...
","The movie features some of the most brilliant CGI I have seen since making people look semi-animated became cool. Great cinematic, including long periods without speaking, built up suspense making the 'real world' of the movie very dark and ominous, and let you know from the offset that this was not going to leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling. Each imagination world Baby Doll and her companions entered, however, was as vivid as the last, giving the movie a video- game feel. The weaving in an out of delusions allowed them to create a different world portraying some of the most used gaming backdrops: a nightclub, modern war trenches, a siege of a Medieval castle, and a super spy mission. Each world featured its own kick-ass action scene supported by a killer soundtrack.<br/><br/>Instead of developing its own score, which I don't think would have worked well with the different levels of film, the soundtrack consisted of adapted versions of hit songs (including White Rabbits and Sweat Dreams) which synced up really well with each scene and added to the video-game aura of each of the fantasy sequences. Think of what Donnie Darko did with 'Mad World' except instead of using it ever few minutes, they picked one that worked on a scene by scene basis.<br/><br/>It turns out that the long periods without talking and the over the top action scenes were to cover up that no one in the movie really had anything to say, and when they did either sounded like coming out of fortune cookie or was just downright dumb (if those are two different things). One of the main characters was literally crying more than she spoke, and frankly for good reason. The plot was pretty straight forward and you never really got into it, turning the parts where they are trying to make things make sense as just a way to get from one action sequence to the next. A few things didn't make too much sense at the end, but you wont really care because the storyline was pretty dull and ended frustratingly and you kinda realize that maybe Baby Doll was in an asylum for good reason.<br/><br/>I was definitely a bit over optimistic thinking that Sucker Punch (2011) would essentially be 300 part duex with 5 semi-naked girls instead of a semi-naked Gerard Butler, and hoards Ninja-Robot and Nazi-Dragons instead of hoards of disturbing deformed Persians. If there was one thing I regret its not seeing this in theaters. Seeing the graphics on the big screen with surround sound would have made the viewing experience leaps and bounds better."
"tomgillespie2002","4","0","3","30 June 2011"," Teenage boys wet dream
","Zack Snyder has directed a couple of quite good films (Dawn of the Dead (2004), and Watchmen (2008)), but this debut as the story/screenplay co-writer, shows that he is more of a visual stylist than one for narrative complexity. Snyder's formative years in television commercials has shown through his film career; fast editing; the oh-so-tired and clichéd use of speed and slow motion in action sequences. In Sucker Punch however, the narrative/visual structure works on this with self-contained sequences, amounting to a series of commercials. The ""adverts"" (or even music videos) are fantasies of Baby Doll (Emily Browning). What these dreams are structurally also, are levels in a video game. To get to the next level, she must complete the task.<br/><br/>Baby Doll is being incarcerated into Lennox home for the mentally ill by her ""evil"" step-father. A lobotomy is ordered. This is where she delves into her imagination, constructing a world where she is imprisoned in a bordello and controlled by men who make them perform for them. Escape is on her mind. When Baby Doll is forced to ""dance"" for the audience, she goes even further into a dual fantasy where she is given orders by ""Games Master"", The Wise Man (Scott Glenn). These game-level ""bosses"" are visual clichés in themselves. Baby Doll and her appointed gang consisting of Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jenna Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), and Amber (Jamie Chung), must battle giant monster-samurai on level one; German zombies in CGI WWI on level two; lord of the rings-like orcs and dragons on level 3......and so on. These fantasies of Baby Doll's are constructed as a device (in the bordello she is simply dancing), which make a simple task such as stealing a lighter off a dumb cook, is turned into a fight for survival from monsters! This is absurdly expensive, derivative nonsense. It's an awful brickolage of visuals that have been on our screens for the last decade. The game-like structure is utterly ridiculous (yes, this type of structure was used to good effect in 2009's Scott Pilgrim vs The World, but that film played as pastiche), and Sucker just uses this device as a means to project dazzling computer effects. They make no narrative sense. Is her dance visually like the fighting in her fantasies? Even if you did want to hide from the reality itself, why would you construct over-elaborate fighting levels just to get a map? These questions are irrelevant, the main concept behind this movie is the perverse collection of fantasy dolls that make up the gang; all short skirts, underwear and stockings. It's a teenage boys wet dream, the product of a juvenile mind. As a teenager in an adults body, I have to say it was nice. However, the film did not have any excitement to it. The characters were bland facsimiles of genre regulars. The action was so similar to so many of these type today, it was hard to care about it, and became tedious very quickly.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"GoxGox","5","0","4","29 June 2011"," Mishmash
","This movie seems like mix of everything and i also have a mixed emotions after watching it.<br/><br/>My initial thought was that someone just threw a bunch of scenes together, like a bet of some sort - bet that he can make a movie with dragons, ogres, samurai, Nazi soldiers (steampunk Nazi soldiers to be precise), giants, mafia-like characters, lunatics, brothel/strip club...and i was partly right.<br/><br/>Movie has weak acting, i couldn't relate to the characters at all, just watching how the plot uncoils, and it wasn't too interesting. Movie was rather predictable, although many might not understand that ""second"" dimension of it (and i'm talking about dance/rape scenes, divided personality etc...). Hell, i'm not even sure i got it right there, but that was my vision of it, and as i said, i have mixed emotions about it.<br/><br/>At one point i thought ""Wow, there's totally new dimension in it."", but that effect wears out after some time, mainly because of bad acting and cliché uninspired dialogue between characters, and fact that movie doesn't offer a twist of some sort, it just follows the linear and obvious path.<br/><br/>What pulls out this mixture is a soundtrack. I really liked it, and it was appropriate IMO. Music adds to the atmosphere, and it's probably the part i liked the most in this movie. Action scenes are nice as well, but too much CGI ruined it for me, made it too much game-like. It's like looking at some game advertisement, and camera angles just add to it. <br/><br/>I've also heard that Extended version is better, but i didn't watched it so can't tell.<br/><br/>Overall, it's too mixed up, i believe movie will attract mostly male teenage audience and they'll like it, but for me it didn't do. Unwitting of that ""second"" dimension i would like it even less, but that was a bit different approach then expected and i give Snyder credits for that. Visually movie looks good, but action scenes somehow didn't suit me, acting too, and good soundtrack (almost regular in Synder's movies) doesn't pull it.<br/><br/>Movie had all the chances to become a classic, but i don't think it will. Bad acting and uninspired dialogues ruined it. Visually it looks good, but with too many ""ingredients"" it fails to deliver. It's mishmash of everything and while some things look great, others ruin it. Therefor just average rating from me, although its potential was much bigger."
"Rob_Taylor","6","0","5","26 June 2011"," It's a little bit different and that's no bad thing.
","Sucker Punch is a deceptively simple film. It's deceptive in that it appears to be a clever movie. But it really isn't.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. It's nice to see a movie that isn't just a straightforward scene by scene celluloid tale. Sucker Punch manages quite well to convince you that it is deeper and more meaningful than it is whilst telling a simple story of an escape from an asylum.<br/><br/>The ""clever"" part is that where an ordinary movie would show and make drama out of the actual steps necessary to escape in reality, Sucker Punch tells these moments through the alternate reality envisaged by the main protagonist, a girl known simply as Baby Doll.<br/><br/>Her flights of fantasy are quite unusual, and very well done for the most part. Essentially the struggle to obtain the necessary items to effect their escape in real-life are obtained in the fantasy segments through the simple resort of slicing and dicing and running and gunning their way through various enemies.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the fantasy elements are well done and realised and couple of those segments are interesting enough that I wouldn't mind a movie based entirely on their concepts.<br/><br/>However, not all is good in this movie. For a start, the characters are so thinly sketched that it is hard to feel any kind of empathy for them, or their plight. The fantasy segments, though executed well, only show the girls in a positive, empowered light, making it difficult to link the asylum girls plight to that of the ass-kicking, scantily clad beauties seen therein.<br/><br/>Additionally in one of the fantasy scenes the girls fail to complete their mission, leading to their failure to secure an item. However, later this item is seen in their hidden storage area and is used by Baby Doll as if the mission had been a success. Continuity error? Or intentional error to highlight the fantastic nature of the story? I wasn't sure.<br/><br/>However, I was sure the ""reality"" sections of the film were meant to be set in the fifties. So it seemed logical that any fantasies that sprung out of the mind of someone living in that era would be limited to the technology of that era. So whilst I can accept the steampunk-esque clockwork and steam-powered nazi zombies, I'm less inclined to believe LCD displays and a Huey helicopter. Were their 'Nam style helo's in the fifties? I'm sure there were many other anachronistic items that I didn't notice.<br/><br/>The worst thing to come out of this film, though, is Zack Snyder's insistence that he made the movie to ""empower"" women. Empower them how, exactly? By dressing them up like Japanese anime characters? By having them enact massive amounts of violence with guns and swords? Fantasy, it may be, but it sure ain't any female fantasy. This has the whiff of over-testosteroned male excess about it. As such, it's pretty easy to see its target demographic - young men.<br/><br/>I don't mind films like this - in fact I quite enjoy them. But I dislike those responsible for them pretending they are something better than what they actually are.<br/><br/>So to summarise then. Reasonably entertaining and slightly different. Characters you don't really care about. Interesting fantasy elements. Made out to be better than it actually is. Worth a watch, but nothing like as special as some would have you believe."

Movies of its kind normally do sucks, because all they have are the visual effects - actions and hot actresses That's all. The storyline is often poor, with little depth and so on.<br/><br/>But it's different for 'Sucker Punch'.<br/><br/>Nope, in overall, I won't say that this movie is amazing, but for its kind, yes it is quite good. There is a storyline, and the characters are all given a descent part to play. Unlike the other movies (of its kind), we don't really know much about the characters of the movie, as in the character INSIDE the characters. But the main characters in the 'Sucker Punch' movie are all given quite some emotional scenes in it. We can see, we can feel their situation, the desperate moments they feel, the urge that they want to escape from the place. But of course, it's not really that well expressed, but as I said again, it's really good for its kind.<br/><br/>However, there's one thing that I really hate. It's the dance Baby Doll does.

"mirwais-orbit","6","0","2","18 June 2011"," Action movie disguised into a non existence concept.
","Movies and imagination always were side by side. So, a movie about a girl that tries to use the imagination to escape from reality isn't an original plot and at the same time is a dangerous one for the fact that movies are natural products of imagination. Sucker Punch follows the same premise of 2010's Inception, which isn't as good as it seems when trying to mix fantasy and reality. I'll not extend my points of view about Inception because I've already wrote about it, but the fantasy product that Sucker Punch offers is more successful than Inception because it's surreal as it could be, and the movie should have stayed like this entirely. But Snyder's attempts to make it not an ordinary action movie fails badly.<br/><br/>Snyder did a lot of promotion and explained a lot of something that in the end is just a movie filled with spectacular action sequences, amazing visuals, young women representing different fetishes in the attempt to attract the male audience, and all this huge package still bore and make us thinking the reasons of its existence.<br/><br/>I've read a lot of reviews about people saying that ""you need to understand it to enjoy it"", for me it's completely the opposite: if you try to understand anything, than you will not enjoy it. That's why the audience didn't get the movie, because there's nothing to get even with all the explanations Snyder gave about its concept because he tried to make it a cult movie and maybe a reference for the genre in this decade giving deep perspectives to an action movie that has nothing to offer. So the audience expects something really huge and then the movie gives nothing than a boo-hoo. I mean... it's an extremely loud thing when just a regular scream should be effective.<br/><br/>Sucker Punch could have everything to be a perfect action movie, but his plot full of empty reasons just messed with its amazing action sequences, making it just a collection of music video scenes. And that's it and only.<br/><br/>One of the other negative things about the movie is about its sexual incoherent intents. If the movie pretends to be about women empowerment why reduce them to fetish characters? If the movie is about women trying to release themselves of men's oppression why keep oppressing them with all its attempts to attract the male audience? The rough and raw beginning of the movie gives the audience interest to keep their attention but then the characters became just a product of the male culture. So, that's why I agree that somehow there's some misogynous thing about this movie.<br/><br/>At first Sucker Punch may seems impressive and pleasant, but then you realize it is just the easiest way to make an action movie disguised into a concept that only exists in Zack Snyder's mind.<br/><br/>As I said before the movie blows your mind with spectacular action sequences, amazing special effects and visual concepts... one of the best since Matrix, 300, among others, really! Technically it's perfect and fans of comic books and video games will be dazzled by it, but should be watched just for theses qualities."

I saw this in IMAX and wished I had have waited for a bigger better flick. The acting is sub par. If you literally shut your brain off for 2 hours and just enjoy the crazy set pieces and pretty ladies, you can make it through it. The best scene in the entire film was the first fight scene and it's basically downhill from there. and complete lame ass ending.

I was disappointed at Babydoll's dance or rather our lack of seeing it.

"simmmz","6","0","1","30 May 2011"," Packs less of a punch, on more of a suck....but still B-Grade fun.
","After the appallingly low approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes (currently sitting on just on 22%), I was apprehensive about spending $10.50 to watch Sucker Punch - and although this is far from the huge success it could have been (given director Zac Synder's potential), it is far from the enormous travesty many reviewers are making it out to be. <br/><br/>The outstanding opening sequence reminded me of Synder's gift for visual flare. It plays out almost like a silent film, to a pumping remix of Sweet Dreams, telling the story entirely through visuals. Pretty soon after Baby Doll (Emily Browning) is incarcerated, the screenplay enters b-grade territory...and the cast of beauties ham it up nicely (as does Jonathan Hamm, as the labotimist).The feisty Sweat Pea (Abbie Cornish) carries a strong physicality on screen, and possesses incredible beauty. I couldn't take my eyes off Cornish when was within a frame. It was like a vortex. Jenna Malone gives it her all, but Vanessa Hudgen's was weak, but it is Emily Browning who milks it for all its worth, with a bit of 'tongue-in-cheekness' poking through her performance. <br/><br/>And yes, the fantasy sequences are incredibly well staged and there are some stunning, eye-popping moments. Sucker Punch's weakness however is perhaps the connection between the fantasy sequences to the real world. There are no clever flourishes that link the two, and thus nothing feels at stake during the action. They remain pure fantasy within the film, and unlike, say Inception, the action feels gratuitous and self- conscious. <br/><br/>The screenplay flounders in the final third as it tries to ground itself in reality and create emotional resonance. The sacrificial ending is questionable too - something more empowering would have been wise given the subject matter. <br/><br/>Sucker Punch isn't intelligent - but it is thrilling. I would consider it far more of a b-movie than most critics are taking it for - and I am entertained by b-movies. Given the high quality of Watchmen, it is perhaps disappointing to see Synder revert back to his 300 days and it remains a shame that Sucker Punch doesn't strive for anything more, given its potential. Let's just hope Superman will give audiences a bit more to chew (or suck?) on."

Ah that was a great opening scene...<br/><br/>Then there's a little bit of plot and then BAM! Time for some quick hallucinating a whole new world. We're introduced to our pretty uninteresting and simple characters, none of which have any depth to them. What they do have is massive sex appeal, which distracted me momentarily for a while as I patiently waited for the plot to happen.<br/><br/>Though eventually oggling Emily Browning was insufficient for my film student self to passively enjoy the film. No, it just kept going. Action sequences were broken up with the calmer scenes. The pretense was really just an excuse to have completely unrealistic violence in various artist landscapes. The problem was that there wasn't much of a challenge, or progression in plot... it was ""I need to do something. Cue fight scene. Fight scene means something is achieved. Dialogue saying we need to do another thing. Cue bizarre fight scene."" Where's the challenges? Where's the progression? Things just happen... because.<br/><br/>Though there was a little bit of an attempt to give depth to Sweet Pea and Rocket by giving them a little bit of a backstory which then FINALLY became a bit of a center for the ""plot"" to revolve around besides Baby doll.<br/><br/>It was a steady downhill descent into mindless pointless plot less violence. I started off being wowed by it, then got bored, then it brought it back to the plot at the end (almost as if there wasn't any gap between the start and the end, like the middle and all the violence was pointless filler - which it was) and I thought that was good... Then the absolute end attempted to be some kind of trippy mind-messing twist which came off poorly.<br/><br/>It is the worst Zack Snyder film I have ever seen, mindless drivel. though not without some redemption. It was a very stylistically well done mindless drivel."

","From the outset of the movie you can tell that the visual styling of which Zack Snyder is famous for is there in all its glory, Every aspect of the film looks fantastic. <br/><br/>The movie starts out with the ""main character"" Babydoll enduring some horrific events which lead to her being committed to a psychiatric hospital. <br/><br/>The hospital is were the journey begins and you get transported to this alternative view of reality and there once again you're transported to a new reality where a quest must be completed and this is where the film sores. <br/><br/>These quests areas are amazing and are beautiful to watch with great music and combat. I would like to make this clear they were steam powered Germans and not Nazi's, it was clearly WW1. <br/><br/>But sadly while all this amazing action is happening you just don't care about the characters performing it, You never build an attachment to any of them as they're so flat and dull. Babydoll says about 5 lines in the whole movie and she has no expressions bar 1. <br/><br/>Ultimately the movie ties together the some amazing scenes which will make every nerd happy but the characters fail to make an impression and story is vague at best, really it seems more like random encounters in a video game.<br/><br/>It is still an enjoyable watch and worth a watch."

","I absolutely adore Zack Snyder. As far as I'm concerned, he is the George Lucas of my generation. Sucker Punch was as visually pleasing as promised, and the concept of the fantasy scenes was so incredibly original I have no other choice but to put mister Snyder at God status. However, I found myself wondering several times why I was the only person in the theatre laughing...was the intention of certain scenes/characters/lines to be so ridiculous, or was it a complete miss. Some of the scenes had so much tension in the background with either an overdone emotional reaction or totally un-buyable intimidation. I am aware that the story is meant to serve as social commentary, but it came off a bit underwhelming. Included in that, is Emily Browning. An amazing actress and believable as a kick-ass chick, I found myself see her as the only one of the bunch that didn't look like she would at all be a good dancer. That would be alright, had it been so that her character is supposed to be this captivating siren of a burlesque girl. Men and women alike are completely enamored with her whenever she takes to the stage, but we never actually see her dance (with I understand from an artistic standpoint), and there is some awkwardness about her that just doesn't make me think that she would actually be so impressive.<br/><br/>As for the effects, well, that and the soundtrack are the reasons the film rated a 6 on my scale. I am the first to admit that I am beginning to expect a lot from my directors these days and tend to nit-pick at the little things. On the whole, the film was extremely enjoyable and I will own it. But I am left in worry over the monstrous use of effects in all action films lately. Every fantasy scene in this film was extravagant in an awesome way, but the robot scene left me thinking that just because you have all kinds of tools in a toolbox doesn't mean you need all of them to hang a picture. I enjoy the use of modern effects, but there is over-the-top, and there is overdone. I hope directors don't get too carried away and take away from the enjoyability because they've thrown EVERY trick at us in one 30 second scene. Sometimes less is more."

","Human imagination is a boundless and valuable thing. ""Sucker Punch"" manages to prove that fact while it fumbles with a complicated storyline. It's a film where beauty prevails but material is needed. To understand ""Sucker Punch"", be aware of the three forms of narrative: one takes place in reality, another is a fantasized stage of that reality, and the other is a complete dream world. <br/><br/>Emily Browning stars as Baby Doll, a 20-year-old girl who is committed to a mental asylum and sentenced to be lobotomized in five days. This is a reality she copes with by creating her own world where the institution becomes a brothel run by chief orderly and sleaze bucket Blue Jones (played by Oscar Isaac). Baby Doll becomes acquainted with her fellow peers and they urge her to take special dance lessons from their teacher (played by Carla Gugino). As she dances, Baby Doll envisions a parallel dream world where physical laws and other rules are naught. With the help of her friends and newfound powers, she plans to escape the facility. <br/><br/>The dream world settings are visually spellbinding in color and design. The exhilarating hues light up the screen to effectively awe the audience and it a grand sight to behold. Every time Baby Doll enters this mystical realm, there are different landscapes with new enemies. It's like watching a live-action kill-them-all video game with orcs, dragons, killer droids, undead German soldiers from WWI, and giant samurai. To fight their opponents, the girls use everything from katana swords to submachine guns. There is a lot of anachronism like the machine guns handled in the WWI trenches but remember, we are beyond reality at this point. The brawls are superbly choreographed so that major blows are stressed while the less-effective hits are kept at a fast pace. <br/><br/>As far as directing goes, ""Sucker Punch"" is Zack Snyder's most mediocre undertaking. He enacts his trademark slow-motion action sequences with proficiency and it's highly commendable. Snyder also tries out new techniques such as the split focus shot (a pet peeve of mine) which is employed in a way I have never seen before, not even in Brian De Palma's movies. But the good qualities of ""Sucker Punch"" are countered by a screenplay, among other things, doused with dialogue that is either decent or rotten. I rarely critique a film's soundtrack but in the case of ""Sucker Punch"", I'll make an exception with a clear purpose. If you look back at Snyder's adaptation of ""Watchmen"", most of the music reflects the time period the story is set in and the selections work well. Snyder mashes random music genres into his film and I feel they ruin the overall tone in the process. <br/><br/>The acting is generally average, neither great nor horrible, with the exception of Scott Glenn's performance which falls below the line. The five main girls try to give their roles satisfying character but in the long run, there are no special traits or attitudes established to help me understand them better. A woman with the name of Rocket (played by Jena Malone) could have a hot-headed demeanor; all I get is a small backstory and no real personality. None of the other girls live up to their nicknames and it's pretty disappointing. <br/><br/>""Sucker Punch"" is fantastic to look at even if it lacks the sufficient pieces to build an inspiring story with vivid characters. Zack Snyder has the talent and knowledge to make a great movie and I do not think this film will haunt him. Yet it might serve as a scar left to remind him of the mistakes he needs to avoid. Now that I think of it, some people are proud of their scars and tend not to make the same blunders again.<br/><br/>My Rating: 5/10"

","Spoiler Alert-------------------<br/><br/>This movie has been messing with my mind since i saw it. Overall i though it was an OK film. the style of movie the action scenes and even some of the acting was good but what blew my mind was the plot there were enough plot holes to make a man go insane. i would just like some insight on what everyone though happened. Did the father kill her sister or did she with the gun it was unclear with the angle and when the girls died in her second reality did they get a lobotomy so that the orderly could have his way with them and was she perceiving a brothel because thats what the facility was like for her help"

","Once again, director Zack Snyder has proved that he can make an ordinary scene extraordinary with special effects and cool music. He's so good at this that it covered some flaws in his movies 300 and Watchmen, however the story was filled with so many flaws that no matter how cool the action was, the movie's flaws make this movie a D+ at best.<br/><br/>I don't need the action to be believable, I need it to be justified through the story. NONE of the action is justified, it's just a fabric of her imagination that Snyder fails to show how it applies to her actual reality. Basically, the action is all for show and has no purpose other than to ""oooh"" and ""aaah"" us. It claims its relation to the story is these girls using it to survive the asylum. Well, what about the other girls alternate reality? What makes Baby Doll's (such a cliché name) imagination so special? There are too many unanswered questions that it is clear that whoever was responsible for the story, failed.<br/><br/>The acting in general was terrible. Carla Gugino did a great job capturing the typical, unoriginal Russian woman with broken English with lines such as ""I help you"" and ""Tell me why you upset?"" Emily Browning (the main character) wasn't convincing at all. You need more than a cute baby face to be an effective lead character. I was kind of hoping she would be killed because she was more abrasive than heroic.<br/><br/>And the ending itself? Please, without giving it away, do you really expect us to believe that? That was such a lame ending it nearly ruined the movie. I hope this film doesn't set a new precedent of movie's based off of the main character's imagination."
