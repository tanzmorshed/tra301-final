","Tom Hanks wrote and directed this paean to the glory days of rock n' roll, an era in which even the wildest music still reflected a certain innocence, long since gone if not forgotten, before the advent of Metal, Rap and Grunge.  It's 1964, and `That Thing You Do!' is about to become a hit record for a small band out of Erie, Pa., who call themselves the `Oneders (pronounced Wonders),' but who are destined to begin their musical odyssey know as the `Oh-NEED-ers.'  Drummer Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) works in his father's appliance store, but when the band's drummer breaks his arm right before a gig, Guy is asked to sit in for him.  And it winds up being a case of being in the right place at the right time for Guy, like when Ringo joined The Beatles, and the rest-- as they say-- is history.<br/><br/>	It's a lively, upbeat tale in which luck, talent and chance all play a part.  Hanks presents the upside of making it in the music business, including the adrenaline rush of hearing one's own song on the radio for the first time, as well as all the hoopla that surrounds those who happen to be in the spotlight at the moment.  But he also shows the downside:  The creative differences and in-fighting which plagues just about any band ever formed to some degree at one time or another, the personality conflicts and petty jealousies that are apt to surface at any time, and the reality of dealing with bloated egos, adoring fans and rude, insensitive record label executives who could care less about the talent that is putting the coins in their coffers, as long as they're selling records.<br/><br/>	For the most part, Hanks keeps it lighthearted and cheerful, which-- along with the original songs (some of which he helped write)-- makes this an entertaining, fun and thoroughly enjoyable movie.  He sugar-coats the dark side of it all to a certain extent, which makes the bad things that happen a bit easier to swallow, though it compromises the impact of the events somewhat as they unfold.  Then again, he manages to maintain the credibility and integrity of his story, and after all, `this' is the film he wanted to make, and he presents it exactly as intended.  Hanks captures a sense of time and place with this film, and also that same sense of reality conveyed by The Beatles' film, `A Hard Day's Night,' intentionally avoiding the more stoic reality of the more recent `Almost Famous.'  All three films are fairly true to life, but with varying degrees of honesty.  It's a matter of whether to `imply,' as Hanks has done, or to be explicit, as Cameron Crowe chose to do with his film.<br/><br/>	With this film Hanks proves that he is equally as adept behind the camera as he is in front of it; he knows exactly where he wants to take his audience and when, and he does it quite successfully.  He also extracts some nice performances from his actors, especially Scott, Johnathon Schaech (Jimmy, the lead singer), Steve Zahn (Lenny, on guitar) and Liv Tyler as Faye Dolan, Jimmy's girlfriend, who takes the brunt of the blunt edge of Jimmy's sudden notoriety.  Hanks also turns in a notable performance himself, as Mr. White, the representative of one of the labels interested in the Oneders.<br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes Ethan Embry (The Bass Player), Charlize Theron (Tina), Obba Babatunde (Lamarr), Giovanni Ribisi (Chad), Chris Ellis (Phil), Alex Rocco (Sol), Bill Cobbs (Del Paxton), Peter Scolari (Tony), Rita Wilson (Marguerite), Chris Isaak (Uncle Bob) and Kevin Pollak (Boss Koss).  What `Happy Days' was to television, `That Thing You Do!' is to movies; a film that evokes that perceived sense of  innocence of a time when life at least seemed simpler.  For the more distance you put between the present and the `Good old days,' the better they get.  In reality, they may not have been better, but Hanks preserves that illusion by giving us a picture of the way we'd at least like to think things were.  And it's more than a pleasant diversion; this is a feel-good film you'll be able to enjoy time and again, because it takes you to a place you'd like to be-- a place you've been to before at one time or another, in one way or another, if only in your mind. And that Hanks can take you there so readily is not only a credit to his talent, but another fine example of the pure magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10."
"moonspinner55","8","34","38","18 March 2001"," Familiar tale told freshly, honestly, with appealing cast
","We've sorta been down this road before: 1960s pop band makes it out of their dead-end hometown for Hollywood, but fame and fortune unravel the fun. Still, this picture has remarkable focus, careful period detail, and a lovely cast that rarely (if ever) strikes a false note. If some of the young actors sometimes seem like they're doing Tom Hanks impersonations, that's okay because director Hanks (himself a co-star) seems to know these characters inside and out--and he likes them. We in the audience are quick to respond, and even the conventional parts of the movie work because Hanks rides over clichés with verve and enthusiasm and wit. Not a raucous comedy a la ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" (which is what it looked like to me in the ads), this has its share of subtle moments. There is a mean-spirited dig at the Frankie & Annette ""Beach Party"" flicks, and the ready-made romance at the end is sugar-coated, but ""That Thing You Do!"" is immensely likable. It has a huge heart. ***1/2 from ****"
"ccthemovieman-1","9","50","59","25 August 2006"," A Refreshing Throwback
","I remember when I first saw this in the '90s and thinking, ""Wow, what a shock: a modern-day movie with no no villains, no nasty people and nary a cuss word."" I kept waiting for that stuff, and it never appeared. It also has a nice sentimental ending. <br/><br/>The story is a simple one about a group of average guys who form a band and become one-hit wonders.<br/><br/>Tom Everett Scott, a young Tom Hanks-lookalike, is an appealing lead and Liv Tyler looks very, very pretty in the female lead role. The band in this almost-old-fashioned musical, is good to hear, too. They are a throwback to the old movie musical days of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland. Yes, you hear the same song (the movie title) over and over but's a great song which is very catchy. The rest of the music is decent, too.<br/><br/>Speaking of Hanks, he plays the promoter of the group. It's not a huge part but Hanks, as always, is entertaining. The whole film is, and, is refreshing to see."
"moosenmoo35244","8","18","20","21 January 2008"," Unless you were there.
","THAT THING YOU DO<br/><br/>Unless you were there. Unless you were of that age, that time and particularly if you were a male and trying to force your grimy little fingers into a ""C"" chord on a Harmony acoustic guitar that was semi in tunewell, you will not understand the depth that this movie has. This movie and ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" capture something that was so real, so tangible but has slipped so completely away from any succeeding generations grasp that to try and film it's time and moment seems impossible. And yet, Tom Hanks did it. I don't know how he managed to grasp the era and the people so well as I thought he was a little too young for that time period. He nails this every boy's fantasy with wit, wisdom and just a touch of sadness. The cast turns in, a spot on encapsulation of people that will be very familiar to any struggling band member from the period. Tom Hanks himself turns in a solid performance as a man apart of, yet removed from the music itself. Men of his age at that time all actually read the Playboy philosophy espoused by Hugh Hefner and secretly wanted to be as cool as one of the Rat Pack. He did a super job of directing this effort and keeping the frenetic pace. All of this brings us to the music, which for the most part is expertly crafted (and I was surprised to see Hanks wrote some of the music also) to remind us of the era. I enjoyed all the songs for what they are. It is ""homage"" which is not exactly copying but using the elements to pay tribute to the influences that shaped the music of that era. People who grew up in the 80's or 90's have no conception of what the music was like then. They can hear it, and yes even appreciate it, but they don't understand that it was rarely on TV, it was not the background music for every commercial you heard or saw and radio stations that played it were decidedly looked down upon. It was not woven into the fabric of life like it is now. It was new, it was dangerous and you had to search it out. You had to want it. That's why I so enjoyed this movie. Even with some of it's false steps and it's occasional heavy handedness that would over power the subtleties of real life I found this movie a guilty pleasure that is completely satisfying and an absolute joy to watch."
"rzajac","9","57","75","24 July 2004"," A Hoot; comes very, very close to being a great movie
","I didn't see That Thing You Do (TTYD) when it came out, and it's too bad. This movie will--strange to think--rank up there with ""Stop Making Sense"" as a classic concert film. Interesting that 1) they're not really comparable, since SMS is real concert footage and TTYD is a mockumentary, and 2) Jonathon Demme is in TTYD!<br/><br/>Is this a timeless movie? Close. Darn close. What's great? Actually--almost enlightening--Hanks' writing is really quite wonderful. The dialog is almost a rare example of direct, effective, ""connecting"" film writing. The casting, directing, and acting is great. The editing is very effective. The sets, costumes, general ""look"" is a delight. The music is very, very effective. So much subtle craftsmanship goes into stuff at the right levels of detail, that you might accuse the film of failing to be like a genuine ""rock 'n' roll experience"" because it's almost too crafty. But I think they pull it off.<br/><br/>What's wrong with the movie? Not much. The ending flags a little. The pre-credits posting of thumbnail future bios of the characters is a cheap device; but again I think it doesn't eclipse the power of the mythic payload (the moral) which ultimately has to do with the power of love. And I don't say that in a wishy-washy sense. What is love? According to this movie, it's that multi-dimensional experience which includes not just finding ""that special someone,"" but also finding your path. It reminds me of an exchange I had with a work buddy who hoped to write ""that big hit tune"" and retire early. I loaned him a record by Fred Frith, which put him off entirely. ""This guy won't ever get anywhere,"" he said. But I patiently explained that he (my friend) and I get up in the morning and go to our corporate jobs. This guy (Frith) gets up and goes to the studio. Who's the success? That's a big life lesson, and I think this movie nuances that very effectively. It can even translate to any of life's pursuits, not just music.<br/><br/>I found myself being continuously delighted by this film. At the risk of sounding like a green ass, I want to plug this film's attention to a time-honored aesthetic virtue: Hard work. This film is a labor of love, with equal attention to the inspiration AND perspiration.<br/><br/>I can't believe how much I like this movie! I feel like a bobbysoxer saying it! I resonated with this movie on many points. Let me give you one example. I was in a little band once and was something of the ""muse"" of that band. Something I always marveled at was how ""the creative process"" people talk about is actually a very simple and practical reality when you're actually being creative. One of the sweet, simple high points of working up a number is the act of picking the tempo. If you've ever done this, you know what I'm talking about. Picking the tempo is a profoundly rewarding act, and of course that's just one small aspect of the process. So the scene near the beginning of the flick where the drummer overrules Jimmy and establishes an uptempo beat to what was supposed to be a ballad is a profoundly resonant moment for me. And the direction and editing bring together an almost perfect picture of the very real and profound joy that this brings to people.<br/><br/>There were many, many moments in this movie that affected me in much the same way. If you haven't seen it and you love ""concert films,"" check it out.<br/><br/>(NOTE: I wrote a little ""trip guide"" to TTYD!, which can be found at: http://www.ronazajac.com/That_Thing_You_Do_Comments.pdf . Hope you find it useful. -raz)"

","If you have ever been in a band and dreamed of getting out of the garage and onto a stage,then this movie is definitely for you! No matter when you had this dream,you'll experience all the pleasures and joys of being a musician,,,and of course all the downfalls.Yes,it is from a time that won't return,when the music business wasn't such a meat parade and had to do with eager talent.That was then and this is now. Still the characters represent the different types you'll come across,the egos, the clowns and the luck of being at the right place at the right time.At this point in time,it is also interesting to see how the cast members have gone on to other projects,the most recent being Liv Tyler in LOTR,Giovanni Ribisi in COLD MOUNTAIN,Thom Everett Scot in ER and I think that Hanks fellow has been around doing this and that."
"johenshaw","10","39","52","15 June 2000"," That Thing You Do - A Review By Jo Henshaw
","That Thing You Do! In every life there becomes a time when that dream you dream becomes that thing you do.<br/><br/>That Thing You Do begins with a group of friends practising for their college talent show. Their band - the amusingly named One-ders win the contest with their catchy song - That Thing You Do. But this is only the beginning of their success story. In a blur, the newly renamed Wonders become a hit - playing at their local clubs, and then moving on to a national tour with Playtone records under the guidance of Mr White (Tom Hanks) The beauty of the film is there is no conflict, just the excitement and exhilaration that the band feels as they become celebrities and this is can't be shown better than in the scene where they first hear their song on the radio and they are literally dancing in the street, you can't help but feel happy for them too. Tom Everett Scott plays the charming Guy Patterson - the electrical store assistant who becomes the  band's drummer and a national sex symbol with his trademark sunglasses.  Lenny (Steve Zahn) is the carefree guitarist who sees the bands success as a huge lark and just throws himself into enjoying every day. Jimmy (James) Mattingly II is the band's creativity - writing the songs - and also its serious side. He sees the commercialisation of the wonders as stifling his creativity and is reluctant to sign anything to do with his music. Liv Tyler is also a delight as Jimmy's girlfriend Faye and the band's biggest supporter. The success of That Thing You do lies in the little things that are so easy to miss yet are the glue that brings the whole film together. Watch out for how well Guy's family react to his success and how the bands first drummer with the broken arm keeps turning up. Also notice how it is Guy that keeps looking out for Faye. It is these little things that will bring you to the film and that find you leaving with a smile and a desire to see it again."
"TigerMann","Null","31","41","1 April 2004"," A great little film with cult movie ambitions
","""That Thing You Do!"" is a perfect film about a group of guys in the mid-1960's inspired by Thelonius Monk-type jazz and Beatles-esque pop music. With one hit single, they are catapulted to clean-shaven, teen idol stardom. The band ""The Wonders"" could easily have been the 60's pop group ""The Turtles"" or ""The Beau Brummels."" The film's plot is fairly simple, yet it doesn't veer off into the typical VH1 Behind The Music avenue of excessive sex and drugs. Matter of fact, they aren't even mentioned. Written, directed and starring Tom Hanks, ""That Thing You Do!"" is honest and easily palitable for younger audiences. It rarely strays away from its theme: The climax and downward slope of musical fame. Viewers can also appreciate several 60's pop culture bones, thrown by Hanks himself to a nostalgic audience of youngsters such as myself. Plot occassionally gives way to hype and music, but that's okay. I was sort of looking for that. I really appreciated the ""The Wonders"" drummer relationship to ""Dell Paxton,"" a jazz musician that's obviously a Thelonius Monk reference. Check them out jamming together during the third act of the film. Now THAT'S what I call truly remarkable music. The song ""that thing you do"" could easily have been a number one single in 1965. It's a simple, hook-laden piece of popcorn that's catchy on a near paranormal level. It was written by members of the modern pop/rock group ""Fountains of Wayne."" One can only wish for more music such as this today. There's enough innocence in it to guarentee parents' wide-eyed approval ... and just a bit of angst to attract the attention of hormone-raging teenagers the world over. Definetly an excellent movie for your shelf ... right next to your DVD copies of ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""The Beatles Anthology."" Also ... check out ""The Beau Brummels."" Rhino Records has issued a great best-of package. One has to wonder if Tom Hanks had them in mind while writing the script. They had a few hits, though none will be as remembered as the poppy ""Laugh, Laugh."" A true gem from 1960's rock 'n roll."
"dunmore_ego","8","10","12","30 September 2003"," That Thing Done Well is a Thing of Beauty Indeed.
","A snappy, exhilarating movie, with a slightly 'down' ending, but which nonetheless entertains, without educating (a staple of American cinema). That's not to say this isn't an excellent film - full credit goes to Hanks (as writer-director) for crafting a vehicle in which he stars, that he is not the star of, focusing on the rise and fall of a rock group ensconced in British Invasion-era America.<br/><br/>'Not educating' because this film deals very little in the reality of the business management behind The Wonders' success. Sure, no audience will sit through protagonists sludging through reams of contracts, but an audience can stomach details on the industry process of promoting an artist, because we see The Wonders single rising the Billboard charts, but no one ever mentions how it does this. Hanks puts in clues, but the dots are never joined - which might be construed as treating an audience as ""intelligent"" - whoa!, let's not go overboard...<br/><br/>The Wonders are drummer Guy (Tom Everett Scott, oozing pleasant-ville like a born-again on crank), bandleader Jimmy (an intensely-focused Johnathon Schaech), guitarist Lenny (Steve Zahn, also pleasant - but unbalanced in that non-threatening way we term ""kooky""), and a nameless bassist (Ethan Embry, a wisp of effete lower end). Rounding out the troupe is Jimmy's unappreciated girlfriend, Fay (the gorgeous Liv Tyler).<br/><br/>After a few appearances and an indie single, The Wonders ""make it"" (see how EASY it is, starving musicians?). In turning them over to a major record label, The Wonders' first Garage Days manager, Phil, portrays a simplistic, ""noble"" approach (""My bird-doggin' is done - Play-Tone's gonna take care of ya""), failing to mention that for a major to express that much interest in a band, the label's rep, Mr. White (a high-foreheaded Hanks), must have bought The Wonders' contract from Phil with a monetary offer he couldn't refuse. When Guy expresses how easy it all seems, White smoothly purrs, ""Well, papers will have to be signed and you'll have to get me the master tapes..."" Suddenly Reality is served - you could almost see the horns growing out of White's forehead.<br/><br/>Hanks doesn't serve up too much of this meat, and by concentrating on the end-result of all the bureaucracy and hard work - the gigs - we are given a skewed view of this ""job."" Seems like it's all just ""fun,"" but there are as many rockers who attest that they ""hate their job,"" as there are desk-jockeys nine-to-fiving. When it's your primary income, it's your Job - simple. And any job done well will elicit fun. Any job where you cannot cope, becomes not fun.<br/><br/>The band guys are perceived as financially secure by movie's end, but a debut artist selling one single - even to Number One - cannot possibly recoup any of the money that the record label advanced to duplicate, promote and distribute the single nationally. As most veteran artists will attest, they had to wait for their fourth or fifth album (not single) to put them in the black fiscally. And The Wonders ultimately reneged on their contract, which meant that any advances assigned as living expenses on tour would suddenly dry up. It's an intimidating, debilitating legal situation that ensues - but the film sidestepped this issue. Rightly so.<br/><br/>The crowning glory of this movie is undoubtedly its synchronized soundtrack. Very few movies (including monumental, award-winning productions like Amadeus or Immortal Beloved) pay this much attention to ensuring that musician's manipulations on screen match the audio soundtrack, except maybe ""This Is Spinal Tap."" (Of course, movies about real musical artists don't enter this assessment: ""Woodstock,"" ""Gimme Shelter,"" ""The Song Remains The Same,"" etc. - although the Zep movie has its mighty share of non-sync passages.) When the Eddie & The Cruisers movies surged into cinemas in the 80s, I was humiliated at the lack of savvy the filmmakers exhibited in their portrayal of the rock and roll milieu. A major musical flaw was the set-and-forget production value for all the songs, making them sound exactly the same, as if they were all recorded in one place at one time, with one overall mix - which is what was actually done, of course - but to bring some credibility to the movie, the producers should have assessed the circumstances for each scene and mixed the music accordingly  which is what Hanks and his audio personnel intuitively did for this movie.<br/><br/>Every single time The Wonders perform their hit, the eponymous ""That Thing You Do,"" the sound is mixed to reflect the type of stadium, bar or studio they are in; every single on screen frame of the actors-playing-musicians is synched  Hanks specifically made his principals take instrument lessons before filming began  down to every single beat of drum-fill on screen being accounted for, down to the guitarists changing to correct chords in correct positions in sync with the audio! If Hanks was brave enough to cast Liv Tyler (a daughter of Rock Royalty), he must have had heady confidence in his team of editors and sound engineers, for to fail at putting across the ""musicality"" of this movie (with Steven's progeny willing to be involved in it) would not allow Hanks to show his face in public ever again.<br/><br/>Of course there are minute flaws, but none worth mentioning here. There are too many trinkets to keep one sated: Guy's fastidious father, Jimmy's fascination with punning the band's name (spelled initially as ""One-Ders"" and subsequently mispronounced ""Oh-NEE-ders"" continuously), the well-drawn band personalities (the ""talented one,"" ""smart one,"" ""quiet one,"" ""zany one""), cameos from Peter Scolari (Hanks' old Bosom Buddy), Rita Wilson, Alex Rocco (Moe Green in The Godfather), Kevin Pollak; the subtle romance between Guy and Fay, who are not actually an item until the last few frames of film...<br/><br/>...and you'll never be able to get that damn song out of your head!"
"dfranzen70","6","4","4","23 February 2000"," A simple fable from simpler times
","Oh sure, we've all seen what this movie's about - the rise of a All-American musical group in the early sixties. And it's chock full of the kind of fellas you'd expect to see in a band, too: the shy one, the wild one, the cute one, the smart one. Obviously these kids are patterned after the Beatles, and Tom Hanks wisely wrote into this one the fact that the ascension of the band takes place shortly after the Beatles' own climb.<br/><br/>
Overall, there's not a whole lot that's out of the ordinary for this movie. There have been countless movies about music groups or solo artists who achieved success (some against horrible odds), only to crash and burn after a short stay at the top. Some are based on fact, some are fabricated by the always-creative (!) minds of Hollywood. And this movie's not all that different. It's fairly predictable from start to finish, but what might set this apart from all the others is its undying charm. There's not an unappealing performance to be seen, including Hanks himself (and he directed, too, so if you don't like it, you know who to blame). Each of the young actors involved is very engaging, especially Tom Everett Scott as Guy, and Liv Tyler as Faye. There's not a false note in the entire movie, and these kids really light up the screen both with their musical performance and their unerring acting. It's a solid directorial debut for Hanks (if you don't include an episode of ""From the Earth to the Moon"" for HBO)."
"LSeals","9","6","7","13 December 1998"," Entertaining and mostly musically accurate for the period
","I just finished watching this again tonight and am still impressed by the little details that Hanks gets right such as the period guitars and amps (loved seeing those blond Fender Bassman amps), awful PA systems and other musical trappings of the period.  The music is infectious (I liked the song they played in Wisconsin that Lenny sang - can't think of the title) and there's a lot in there that I still remember about having a garage band back in that era.  There's just so much right about this movie that I'd recommend it to anyone.  Another impressive score for do-it-all Hanks."
"SKG-2","8","20","31","21 October 1999"," Light but charming film
","Overall, I have to say I enjoyed Hanks' feature directing debut(this is not, by the way, the first time he sat in the director's chair; he directed a segment of a Showtime film noir series; I think it was called CITY OF ANGELS).  He did a convincing job not only recreating the time, but also the music, which sounded like period music without being a pale shadow of it. He also made a wise choice for his lead; Tom Everett Scott may not have moved on to bigger things yet, but as this film shows, he's destined for them.  Steve Zahn is funny as always, Hanks does well playing a company man, and Liv Tyler is quite luminous(though I could have done without the ""thousand kisses"" speech; that was melodramatic).  On the down side, I'm not a big fan of Johnathan Schaech, but his character was too much of a caricature.  And sometimes it was just too light.  Still, this was overall an enjoyable movie."
"hisown","9","12","17","5 September 2005"," LOVE this movie!
","As a child of the 60s and a musician, I loved this movie from the first few minutes of it. The sets, the clothes, the music, and everything down to the small details is represented here to give a true feel for what the early to mid sixties were like, minus the politics and Vietnam. Before radio music became a commercially diluted and corporate industry there were ""garage-bands"" galore and many of the little-remembered names of the genre started out as such. The Wonders in ""That Thing You Do!"" could easily be a number of bands that were a one-hit-wonder (or two or three) and then just disappeared from the scene. Nevertheless, they all helped shape some of the best music of that era, and Tom Hanks perfectly represents that phenomena in this movie. If you remember the early 60's fondly, you should truly enjoy this film and it will probably bring back fond memories. The depiction of Erie, PA during this time-frame is probably representative of many small to medium size American towns and certainly brought back great memories for me of better times gone by. The music rocks, the dialog is hip, and the love story rounds it out perfectly. Buy this movie and then buy the CD soundtrack; you won't be sorry! (**TRIVIA: another Tom Hanks produced movie, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", has a ""That Thing You Do!"" song played during the wedding reception - do you know which one?**)"

There was some great acting here too, especially, by the brilliant Tom Hanks. This is a movie, that everyone should see. That Thing You do, definitely deserves a 10/10."
"brianlaughran","10","5","6","5 September 2009"," A very good movie to say the least.
","First things first, i have to hand it to Tom Hanks. The man can direct and act. ""That Thing You Do"" is a movie with no antagonist, no good guys and yet it's a great movie. It follows the story of the Wonders, a band Eerie, Pennsylvania who make it big with their hit single, ""That Thing You Do!"" They are then picked up by a major record company and are headed off on tour. The rest of the film follows the relationships that blossom and wilt within the band as they climb the ladder of success.<br/><br/>This is a sweet and innocent movie with no other intentions than to tell a story. Which in my opinion is the way a movie should be done. ""That Thing You Do"" gets an A."
"Bowserb46","9","5","6","15 December 2008"," And now there's a 'director's cut'?
","I've been seeing this movie on cable for several years...all the way through a couple times, but pieces many times. It seems like I can't pass it up when I'm flipping channels. And it happened again today, but to my surprise, it was a different, longer movie. I don't recall the original running time, but today's version must be 30 minutes or so longer than the one I've been seeing for years. At 2:35, it should have been too long, but it didn't seem like it.<br/><br/>Lots of times the director's cut is just a reattachment of footage from the cutting room floor, and sometimes it is footage that should have been left there. I can think of a few exceptions: Jacob's Ladder is one. Aliens is another. And as it turns out, That Thing You Do is still another. The extra scenes, which were cleverly edited out of the short version, add a great deal to the story. They help to fill out the characters and explain attitudes.<br/><br/>Some of the add-backs were no more than a few seconds, but those few seconds--like the cut to the ""cootie"" DJ playing the record after hearing it live--were like the end of a sentence. They made the first part make sense. Others, like the group nervous and suspicious about their new manager not coming through with with air play of their record, are doubtless part of the garage band routine. And more screen time for Liv Tyler can only be good.<br/><br/>All in all, I have to say the re-edit made it a better movie, at least for me."
"Rumples","8","5","6","10 January 1999"," I don't want to gush but...
","This is really a great movie, no question. I rarely watch a film that is so skilfully crafted and yet is completely inoffensive to any segment of society. The movie combines comedy (and some parts are definitely funny) with romance in a tender-hearted tale of friendship and growing up. I simply cannot recommend this movie highly enough except to say that this is a film I could watch multiple times. Brilliantly acted by a still maturing cast ensemble, witty dialogue, it's got it all. If you want to see something that with touch you and give you a buzz but you don't want to be assailed by profanity, violence, or sexuality - That Thing You Do! is the movie for you. Another Hanks triumph, not just for his role in the movie but for putting it all together.  8/10"

","When I saw this movie advertised in the theaters back in 1996, I rolled my eyes in great disdain. For one thing the advertising banner - ""In every life there comes a time when that dream you dream becomes that thing you do"" hit me the wrong way. After all, 95% of us never wind up doing the dream we dream...there is no WHEN in our lives for this event. Plus, I just figured it was an attempt by Tom Hanks to go highbrow via a directorial debut after those back-to-back Academy Awards.<br/><br/>When I finally got around to seeing the film I really loved it. The first half is very upbeat as the band gets started out. They truly are the ""One-ders"", just like many other bands of the Beatles' transitional era. They wrote and performed one song that got them national attention, and then couldn't follow up with anything else. That's too bad, because the band does get one lucky break after another at the start. The guy in the camper that shoves a bowl of stew and a contract in front of them and tells them to ""trust me"" could have had them signing anything. They got lucky that he was legitimate and really did intend to get the record on the air and not steal it from them. That's what makes the disintegration of the band at the end so sad. One by one, they just walk away from their dream. To me, if the movie had any flaw, it was this - the band members just acted like the whole thing was one big amusement park ride rather than a once-in-a-lifetime life changing opportunity.<br/><br/>Finally, I also loved all of the authentic looking stage designs. The home appliance store really brought back memories. These type of family owned appliance stores were all over the place back in the 1960's before the big box stores gradually made them extinct. Plus, the appliances being sold looked just like what was available in 1964 right down to the brand names and the styles."

","I find myself mesmerized by this film.  I identify with its characters because either I had friends who had similar situations (playing in a local rock band, trying to make good), or I myself went through some of the same ""growing pains"" of adolescence, such as parental upset, and the joy and sorrow of a first love.<br/><br/>The songs (especially the title tune) are catchy, yet simple, and at times annoying (due to overplay), but, hey, that's the way rock 'n' roll was at the beginning of the ""British invasion"".  At least they have a good beat and are easy to dance to!!<br/><br/>Baby-boomers will appreciate how Tom Hanks catches the true flavor and feel of the era.  The young actors showed their capabilities by getting the personalities of their characters down just right. You'd think they actually lived through the early 60's themselves.

"Epaminondas","7","3","4","4 January 2005"," Nice moral tale, full of youthful energy
","This film, while obviously not a major work of art, is more than a Beatles biopic or a time piece for the mid-60's. Its sheer energy, the ease with which we can relate with the characters (even for those of us who have ever played in a band), the beauty of Liv Tyler and the natural flow of music bring it to a highly enjoyable level.<br/><br/>Most of all, what makes it interesting is the quite subtle way it handles the themes of hope and disillusion: Guy's hopes for a session in a studio, Lenny's hopes of stardom, Faye's hopes of everlasting love. But as characters shake away their illusions, they are not left bitter or empty: on the contrary, this film shows that to work through this (and it is clearly a piece of work) enables them to build stronger and truer desires.<br/><br/>Despite its agreeable lightness, this film can thus be seen as a moral fable going somewhat deeper than the classic 'from success to failure' story. The acting and reproduction of 60's sets are flawless throughout. And two moments of the film strike me as unforgettable, which is more than you can say for many movies:<br/><br/>When the Oneders's tune goes on the radio for the first time, Hanks films first of all the bass player trying to adjust to the right channel, then Faye losing it as she hears it in the street as well. They both meet and go berserk with joy, running and shouting in an exhilarating - thanks to the youthful grace of Liv Tyler - moment, ending up in Guy's store where everybody just dances madly with joy. Rarely has a moment of accomplishment and sheer happiness been captured with such apparent spontaneity on film.<br/><br/>Finally, Hanks delivers one of the most devastating lines I've heard, when he answers the egoistic lead singer after his breakup with Faye.<br/><br/>Jimmy: I should have dumped you in Pittsburgh! Which one of you butts said we were engaged? <br/><br/>Hanks: Same one who said you had class, Jimmy.<br/><br/>That's what you get, and deserve, from 'dumping' Liv Tyler - poor move if I ever saw one!"
"SwingBatta","9","3","4","5 February 2002"," ""That Thing"" is wonderfully done with irresistible style and substance
","That Thing You Do! (1996): There are so many great things about this film that it's impossible to single out just one. The script, the acting, the characters...to paraphrase that old car commercial, who could ask for anything more? Oh, and throw in some pretty darn addictive music to boot. Add everything together, stir well and the result is a terrific directorial debut for Tom Hanks. ""That Thing You Do!"" tells the tale of a (fictitious) band, The Wonders, who literally become an overnight sensation after winning a talent competition and soon find themselves experiencing the highs  not to mention the lows  of becoming rock stars. The band members  Guy (Tom Everett Scott), Jimmy (Johnathon Schaech), Lenny (Steve Zahn), and the unnamed bass player (Ethan Embry) are perfectly cast, as are supporting characters such as Jimmy's girlfriend Faye (Liv Tyler), Guy's brusque father (Holmes Osborne), mattress tycoon Boss Vic Koss (Kevin Pollak), down-on-his-luck drummer Chad (Giovanni Ribisi), jazz great Del Paxton (Bill Cobbs), with the best being Lamarr the hotel doorman (Obba Babatunde). Despite Hanks' considerably large amount of screen time as the band's manager, his role is restrained enough so as not to overshadow the film's young players. The acting is superbly enhanced by the terrific script; the dialogue is razor-sharp and at times very humorous, with the funniest moments involving the conception of the band's name (spelled ""The One-ders"" early on as a gag on the Beatles, it's constantly mispronounced as ""The O-neders"" before finally being changed to the literal spelling). Nothing ever resorts to condescension, explicit language or sensuality, or forced comedy. You can't help but share in the Wonders' ecstasy when they hear their single on the radio for the first time. The title song never gets boring even though it's played a grand total of 11 times (yet only twice in its entirety). The production design is outstanding, especially Guy's father's appliance store (where did they find all those gadgets?). TTYD is recommended viewing for any budding rock band, or simply for those who want to travel back to a time when music wasn't polluted with countless no-talent, assembly-line boy bands, misogynist rappers, and the like. Finally, we have a feel-good movie that actually lives up to that otherwise overused title. 9/10"

","My guess is that Tom Hanks is a really nice guy. He certainly seems like it when he's interviewed, and since he wrote and directed this movie, and it's really nice, too, that seems to be more evidence.<br/><br/>This is a very small movie. It has no pretensions, but just tells a simple story about a small-town band that makes good. It paints a nostalgic picture of the 60's -- I grew up in a small town during that time, and life wasn't so idyllic in my town -- but it isn't trying for gritty realism. The cast is attractive and more than adequate (some are quite good, including Hanks as the band's manager), and the story is observant enough to be an enjoyable confection. It's very nice family movie (my kids liked it, and so did I)."

","I had seen this movie a number of years ago but didn't remember much about it, so I saw it again today on DVD from my public library. I was a college Freshman in 1963/64, when the Beatles were first gaining popularity on this side of the pond, and this movie fairly accurately recreates that period, the way people dressed, and how teenagers reacted when seeing their pop idols live in concert.<br/><br/>The story grabs hold of a theme I am very fond of pondering, both in real life and in fiction stories. That theme is the relative randomness of our lives, the things that happen, and then how we react to those random events. If we look at random events in our own lives, we can see how certain unexpected things shaped who we are today.<br/><br/>In this movie a group of high school friends like to make music, one of them writes songs and is the featured singer. He has written ""That Thing You Do"" and they are about to perform it in a local small-potatoes contest. But the drummer, horsing around by showing the bass player how to jump over parking meters, falls and breaks his arm right before the contest.<br/><br/>Now that is the ""random event"", and it leads them to ask another guy in town, who is a good drummer, to sit in for that one gig, so that they will still have a chance to win the competition. Then comes the rest of the influence of that ""random event"", the drummer own his own (this is important) decides to beat out a much faster tempo. It is this faster tempo that makes ""That Thing You Do"" a hit with the audience, attracts the attention of an agent, gets them a record, gets them a contract, puts them on tour, and has their hit rise towards the top of the charts.<br/><br/>If their original drummer had not broken his arm, they would have just remained an ordinary band. <br/><br/>Well as the story progresses they experience all the growing pains of sudden fame, and conflicting priorities among the members of the group. Tom Hanks directed, has a part as a record label agent, and he even wrote many of the songs. <br/><br/>Tom Everett Scott who was in his mid-20s is very good as the replacement drummer, Guy Patterson. Liv Tyler, still a teenager was Faye Dolan who ended up traveling with the band. Her boyfriend was Johnathon Schaech as Jimmy who wrote the song and sang lead vocals. Steve Zahn was the crazy member Lenny, and Ethan Embry, also a teenager, was T. B. Player the unreliable bass player. <br/><br/>Another teenager just starting her career was Charlize Theron as Tina in a fairly small part, as a flaky girlfriend who dumps Guy after an appointment with a handsome dentist. Plus young Giovanni Ribisi as Chad , the original drummer who breaks his arm.<br/><br/>All in all a fairly pleasant movie."

"bob the moo","Null","5","10","23 April 2005"," Lacking a bit of depth but breezy and enjoyable with a nice sense of period
","In small town America, a group of friends gain a new drummer in the shape of Guy Patterson and a new band name in the ""One-ders"". Getting the crowd going at their school competition with their catchy number ""That Thing You Do"", the One-ders get offered a gig at a local bar. The local buzz takes a few minutes to get going but soon their song is the talk of the town's youth and they decide to print the record up themselves. When a small time manager picks them up they get a few more gigs but things really start to move when they get signed by Play-tone and manager Mr White. However with increasing fame comes the adrenalin rush of success but then tensions, creative differences, distractions and all the stresses of their 15 minutes.<br/><br/>Acting as writer and director, Tom Hanks draws on the idea of fame and the setting of the mid-sixties to create a film that is fun even if it never consistently has the depth that it needed to make it more of a memorable affair. The plot is the rise and eventual fall of the band  this is not a spoiler as the point of the film is that they will be a one-hit wonder; it is enjoyable on this level because it has much that is recognisable and easily referenced to the experience of real groups down the years. It doesn't make these references in a heavy way but mostly with good humour and pace; only really towards the end does the script stumble a bit as it seems to realise that it needs substance to make a good ending and then tries too hard with too little. Outside of this though, it mostly moves very slickly and made for an enjoyable watch even if it isn't that memorable. It was amusing without ever being hilarious; well set in the period without ever having a lot of style to it and interesting without ever really getting beyond the basic pigeonholed characters (goofy one, creative one, girlfriend of the band etc).<br/><br/>The cast helps by matching the breezy feel for the film but they do tend to struggle when anything more is asked of them. Scott is a point in case; he is asked to carry the film, which he does do when it is all slick but the attempts at substance see him seemingly unsure of what to do. Tyler is in the same sort of boat but is still a good presence. Zahn is funny without being annoying; Schaech has a clear character and plays it well and Hanks makes sure he has a good support role for himself. The support cast has lots of faces in there with minor roles for Cobbs, Ribisi, Theron and others.<br/><br/>Overall this is an OK film that is enjoyably breezy and ""nice"". It references well enough to be recognisable but it doesn't have a great deal going on just below the surface that it could have done with to really make it memorable. Like the Wonders themselves, it is fun and slick when it is on but when it is over you'll find yourself quickly moving on to the next film with not too many memories."

There is a sweet wholesome quality through the whole movie and it's mood is contagious. Definitely a fun movie to watch.<br/><br/>I will say that the most interesting characters for me, were not the guys in the band, they were Tom Hanks himself and Liv Tyler who's darling here as Fay. I liked the fact that these characters were not over the top and were very believable. I wouldn't really refer to this as that much of a comedy, it doesn't have a lot of fall down in your seat funny lines. What it does have though is sweetness.

","The fun and convincing story of four young guys in a local pop band in early 60s America who make a record, and what happens next...
As they progress in the US pop business, the film paints a picture of the business at that time, including characters ranging from a very doubtful would-be 'manager', whose office is his truck, to Tom Hanks' slick, go-getting record company executive. The soundtrack features very accurate pastiches of 60s pop songs styles, including Motown and pre-Beatles pop ballads. And of course the title song, which we get to hear a number of times as the band promote it on TV and on tour, giving the feel of what it's like to 'live with' a song as you take it on the road and end up playing it for the fiftieth time while that night's audience are hearing it live for the first.
The life of the band as four guys is convincingly portrayed - love lives, struggles with management, artistic compromise, artistic influences and differences between themselves - giving the film a reality, depth and colour.
I won't spoil the ending, but this enjoyable film portrays four young guys (and their best friend girl) having the time of their lives while also facing the struggles that their dreams and choices, and life itself, bring. Well worth seeing."

Once we understand the importance of Jimmys' tag along girlfriend Faye, its obvious that the movie has as much to do about the love of their music and what they all bring as a five person unit, as it does about the story line in itself.<br/><br/>Tom Everett Scotts' Guy exudes the young directors charm and resemblance and the serious Johnothan Schaech brings to Jimmy are equally important. It may have been Fountain Of Waynes' Adam Schellengers' song (title track) but you wouldn't think twice about that until reading the trivia section of IMBD.

He would have been active during the ""Roaring 20s,"" and during the ""Swing"" era. I doubt that he would have made a transition to ""bebop"" by that time.

","""That Thing You Do!"" represents any music band's dream of having a successful career along with a song to take them to fame and rising to downfalls at the same time. The film is about a drummer name Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) who works at his father's appliance store while his friends are out there having a good time in a rock band with no title to call themselves. Guy is needed for his gift after the band's drummer Chad (Giovanni Ribisi) breaks his arm where they perform their song ""That Thing You Do!"" at a local high school gymnasium and become an instant hit. The band members include Jimmy (Jonathan Schaech), the lead vocals and lead guitarist, Lenny (the hilarious Steve Zahn), the second guitarists and vocals who happens to be the comic relief and smart-ass of the group, and T.B. Player (The Bass Player, played by Ethan Embry) where they have a groupie, Jimmy's girlfriend Faye (The lovely Liv Tyler). After being a success by singing their famous song through various places including a pizza parlor, the new band who call themselves The Wonders, find a manager where they go through a cheap gig before the big guns comes to the boys.<br/><br/>Mr. White (played by Tom Hanks) replaces their formal manager and heads the band into a tour with other famous singers. From there the band gets to find out the ups and downs of being in a band where members decided to leave, girls get in the way along with some of them from home break up with them (ex. Guy's girlfriend leaves him for the dentist) and nobody wants to follow the rules.<br/><br/>The film was directed by Tom Hanks where not only does he show what goes on in a band, but brings back the atmosphere of the 1960's where it feels like I'm watching a document about the American version of The Beatles. Plus, the soundtrack itself is hot! I'd still play the songs from the fictional band on my CD player, thinking to myself that they're only pretend and not real. Yet, the songs are a classic just like this movie. Now go put on some shades and watch this movie."
"HelloTexas11","7","1","1","4 February 2008"," 1964 once more
","Tom Hanks' writing and directorial debut, 'That Thing You Do!', will probably not go down in history as a classic along the lines of 'Forrest Gump' or 'Saving Private Ryan,' but I find it one of those movies I love to revisit every six months or so. It has an easy-going charm about it, low-key and yet wonderfully evocative of the period it presents, that magical year of 1964, after the Beatles had arrived and changed music forever, and every teenage kid wanted to start his own rock band. 'That Thing You Do!' was a modest success at the box-office, and the critics were generally kind to Hanks' first try at directing. Just below the surface, though, one could tell people were surprised and in some cases disappointed that his initial effort wasn't somehow more substantial, or biting, or something. I take it these people were someplace else in 1964. In the film, Jimmy (Jonathan Schaech) is the one who starts the band, the one with big dreams and a fair amount of talent. The other three band members are pretty much along for the ride, wherever it leads them, and if it doesn't lead anywhere, that's okay... they weren't doing anything anyway. Lenny (Steve Zahn) is the goofy lead guitarist; there's the unnamed bass player (Ethan Embry) who's even goofier (listed in the credits as T.B. Player; clever how they go through the whole movie without calling him by name); and the drummer Guy (Tom Everett Scott), who is a last-minute replacement for their regular drummer after he falls off a parking meter and breaks his arm. Guy is in his own way just as much a music buff as Jimmy, but his love is jazz. He doesn't much care for the pop/rock the group (newly dubbed the Oneders, hopefully pronounced Wonders) but he enjoys their taste of success and playing for the enthusiastic crowds that grow larger as the film progresses. Guy's not the leader or control freak that Jimmy is; he emerges though as the heart of the band and is, ironically, the last one left standing at the end of it all. Also along for the ride is Faye (Liv Tyler), Jimmy's girlfriend and the Oneders' number one fan. In an early role, Charlize Theron plays Tina, Guy's girlfriend (if only briefly). If only her part was as memorable as her looks. The band makes a record of Jimmy's song 'That Thing You Do!', and after it gets some radio play in their hometown, they are noticed by Mr. White (Tom Hanks), an exec at Playtone Records who becomes their manager. One of his first decisions is to change the name of the band to the Wonders. People kept calling them ""the Oh-need-ers"" and it was getting confusing. From there, the film takes us on a predictable but very enjoyable ride as the song climbs the charts and the Wonders grow in popularity, playing to larger and larger crowds, finally culminating in them appearing on a big network variety show. The song, by the way, is a great little tune, very Beatle-ish, and almost criminally catchy. I don't know how many times it's played in the film, in part or in whole (I would guess about a dozen) and it changes subtly over the course of the movie, bits added for extended versions... in any event, it will be buzzing around in your head for at least a week or so after seeing the film. In what has in reality been the case more times than most people realize, the Wonders break up just as 'That Thing You Do!' peaks at #7 on the Billboard Hot 100. Jimmy quits in a fit of pique, his artistic vanity wounded when White tells him he only gets to write two songs per album. Lenny marries a blonde secretary in Las Vegas. The bass player joins the Marines. That leaves Guy to face Mr. White alone, who tells him the Wonders are in breach of contract, but it's no big deal. Happens all the time, White says... to one-hit wonders."

There are very few people who can succeed in acting on television, acting in movies, and making movies.<br/><br/>I am glad to say that Tom Hanks is one of them.<br/><br/>In his first attempt at directing a movie, Hanks brings us a flat-out fun story of a small rock group who climb the charts of success, only to fall flat just as quick as they rose. The movie has everything: the comedic timing of lines delivered by Steve Zahn and Hanks himself make us laugh without entirely turning the movie into a silly comedy. There are dramatic moments with Johnathon Schaech's character without turning the movie into a drama, and there is music galore without turning the movie into a musical. Everything is wonderfully balanced, not one element overpowers the other, and it comes across as an entertaining film.<br/><br/>With a movie like this, certain elements need to be executed perfectly in order for it to work. When you make a movie that follows the experiences of a group of teenagers, you need to be able to like the characters. I don't know if you'll find a much more likable character than Guy Patterson, an easy-going jazz lover who stumbles into the band by accident, then drives their climb to success with a simple change of tempo. You need to make it fun without being cliché, so keeping the band from reaching #1 on the charts is a smart move. And with any movie with a song as the centerpiece, you need to like the song. ""That Thing You Do!"" could be one of the catchiest songs to come out of any movie in recent memory, and the other songs that you hear over the course of the movie are entertaining, as well. When you can combine the star power of Tom Hanks and Liv Tyler with the music, magic, and sheer entertainment of this movie, you can't possibly go wrong. 9/10"

","This movie was very heartwarming, funny, energetic, musically non stop! The actor that played the drummer for The Wonders was awesome! He actually knew how to play. This movie was fun. Tom Hanks at his best, (Forrest Gump, The Green Mile, BIG.) Great fun. I loved the theme song so much, I got on Itunes and downloaded New Found Glory's version of the theme song, That Thing You Do! It's an awesome song, and movie. See this, if you just want to have fun. The acting was wonderful, the lead singer I thought, looked a bit like the lead singer for The All-American Rejects. The drummer kind of reminded me of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2, and Spider-Man 3 actor Tobey Maguire, physical resemblance. (Spoiler) The band originally has their named spelled, The Oneders, people in the film have in mistaken for the Oneeders, so they changed it to The Wonders, thanks to Tom Hanks character, who is their second manager."

","Every actor in this movie does a spectacular job. You're immersed in their world immediately, and at no time do you want to leave. All of the songs are good, and the soundtrack was worth buying too. Tom Hanks does a good performance, and I thought it was pretty cool that the actors actually learned how to play their instruments in this movie, and you can tell during theperformance scenes. The humorous parts were actually funny, and thesomber parts were realistic. The characters were original and memorable, especially Mr. White, played by Tom Hanks. The song ""That Thing You Do!"" is a great song, it has a very Beatles feel to it, as does the entire movie; it conjures up images of the Beatles' movie ""Help"". It's a shame it isn't recognized by the general public, but overall, a great movie."

Tom Hanks - as usual a superb performance, and seeing as he did everything else as well, fantastic!! I can honestly say I have never actually watched a film that I really do want to watch again and again, and I intend to as well. The script is perfect for the time, the acting is no where near as wooden as it would have been if filmed then and the actors are that good, you can actually believe that they are a band, and would buy their records.

","One of the best movies I have ever seen. If I had the time I would watch it every day. Tom Hanks is EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tom Everet Scott at his best work yet!!!! Liv Tyler is absolutely amazing, even though the film is about the band she just steals every scene that she is in, especially the dramatic ones. It is a great family movie, I watch it with my family all of the time. Wonderful writing, beautifully done. All I can say that it is one of my favorite movies of all times. Absolutely brilliant. Very surprising ending, but at the same time it was something I should have been expecting. Two of the main characters end up (for different reasons) being without their significant others and slowly fall in love. Even though the band breaks up, you are not so disappointed by the end because of the love story. The soundtrack is probably the best part of the entire movie. All of the music is absolutely excellent, I am not very old, so I don't know if any of the bands and groups are real, but the music is wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

","The O-Needers rock my world. LOL, OK so it's the One-ders, I get it now. OK, this movie takes place in the 1960s, when a lot of young guys started to create rock bands, i.e. Jim Morrison and John Fogerty. Unfortuneatly unlike Morrison and Fogerty the One-ders only had a one-hit song. That doesn't really matter though does it, because the song is really great, it was actually written by Tom Hanks, and it's played by the 4 gentlemen in the band. The song is called, ""That Thing You Do"", hence the movies title, and it's a really great song, nicely recorded and it's a catchy tune.<br/><br/>OK, so 4 guys get together in there garage and write this song, and they at a talent show and decide to start a record, which turns out to be a mega-hit, so they get a manager who gets them a couple gigs, and eventually Tom Hanks comes along and discovers that he can do more for the band than there previous manager, which he eventually does. However like all great bands from the 60s they have their rise and unfortunate fall. This movie explores that, and it does so in a great story.<br/><br/>I gave this movie 10 out of a possible 10, because it's a great movie, filled with great characters, a terrific story and a catchy soundtrack. It's got tons of lines mostly that come from Zahn. If your like me and you love rock and roll bands, this is a great story, I love it, it's one of my favourites!"

He is so fresh in his writing and story line. I couldn't ask for much more in a movie.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10, was because when I watched the featurette, I saw so much more to this movie that had been cut out. I wish it had all been left in. Even in the theatrical preview, there is a scene where Lenny and his gal pal are eating spaghetti together and that is nowhere to be found in the movie.

Once you see it you will want to see it again and again. It's extremely entertaining with a magical quality that makes you hunger for more. Mr. Hanks should quite proud of all of his work in this film. He has accomplished many times over what many fail to do. Speaking from real world experience as a musician that almost made it, I can say that this movie is right on the mark of realism. All of the cast did an excellent job of making this film very believable. That thing you do could have have truly been right out of the annals of our history.

","This movie has it all. Coming of age. A few plot swerves. Great American music. Young people in the fullness of life. I highly recommend it. There are so many positives here. The newness of some of the actors mix so well with established ones. There are almost too many cameos (including Rita Wilson) to catch. And Hanks works in so many old friends plus the record company he created for the movie now actually exists to carry all the soundtracks for his subsequent works. I like the music, all of it, from the featured tracks to the subtracks to the background noise of the other performers. The chronology is very believable as are the sets. The recreated hotel in LA matches everything you'd dream up. The bit with the beach movie (more cameos) is hilarious. You'll watch it to see what you missed the first time. Truly America in an innocent age."

Even more surprising is that this movie can be watched without embarrassment with younger kids!! A-Mazing. Casting is perfect. Great supporting cast as well.

","Tom Hanks makes an impressive writing-and-directorial debut with 'That Thing You Do!', a musical comedy/drama set in the 60's about a one-hit wonder band called, appropriately, The Wonders. Tom Hanks is also in the movie, as Mr. White, the manager of the band. Overall, this is light-hearted, peppy, upbeat, and humorous. Hanks does here what he does best: comedy/drama. Hanks' wife, Rita Wilson, makes a small cameo in the film. The acting is solid, the title song is great, and the script is good. Tom Everett Scott plays the main character, Guy Patterson, the drummer of the band. Liv Tyler, pre-Lord of the Rings, is also good here. And Steve Zahn is very good at being a dummy.

It sounds so real for the era you can't stop thinking, ""How come I don't remember those songs?""<br/><br/>I could really relate to Faye, as a female being associated with the band. What memories and emotions were brought back to me.  First as a child with my girlfriend's older brother and his band.  Then as a groupie for the neighborhood band in the early '70s.  I can still vividly remember sitting on the neighbor's basement steps watching and listening as the band practiced.  I loved being one of their groupies.  We shared in their successes and their disappointments.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this for the whole family."

","That Thing You Do!, Tom Hanks' first directorial effort, is an entertaining movie.  The cast is pretty good, and introduces many young stars, including Tom Everett Scott and Liv Tyler.  The weakest part of the film was, surprisingly, Tom Hanks' acting.  The music is very good, as is Liv Tyler. That Thing You Do! is a charming film, but is by no means a cinematic triumph.  I did enjoy it though, and I recommend it."
"TheOtherFool","6","3","6","12 May 2004"," An OK movie I guess
","Nice little flick by Tom Hanks, about a group of teenagers from Erie, Pensyllvania becoming the next big thing in the sixties with their band, the Oneders (that's Wonders). One would expect the movie follows the routines set in this genre, but somehow it stays clear from it. The hot-shot manager (Hanks himself) is even pretty nice and the band don't break up because one guy thinks he's more important than the other one (what you would expect after drummer Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) is considered the heart of the band while he's just in it for a couple of months).<br/><br/>Too bad though there is this one thing always at the background: Faye (Liv Tyler). She's involved with singer Jimmy (Johnathon Schaech) but somehow Guy is interested in her too. Not that it's an issue throughout the movie, but you always feel it's going to end up like that. But, until that point, the friendship in the band is there and they're just having a good time while their single is climbing the charts...<br/><br/>Small roles as well for (now) oscar-winner Charlize Theron as girlfriend of Guy, Giovanni Ribisi as original drummer of the Oneders (until he broke his arm), and Chris Isaak as Uncle Bob. Oh and I love Holmes Osborne as the father!<br/><br/>Star for me though is Steve Zahn as Lenny. He's so funny! Anyway, a cute little movie here you will enjoy with the entire family, though nothing really special. 6/10."
"edgy","5","7","21","8 November 1998"," Peppy Song, Sad Movie
","Painful to watch at times; the goofiness of some of the band members is nearly unbearable.  The creative leader of the band suddenly becomes a selfish twit near the end of the film. He inexplicably dumps the girl (Liv Tyler) he had always adored. She quickly falls for another band member and they live happily ever after. Of course, the band members have already parted permanently, not just as collaborators, but also as friends.  The idea is they were never friends at all, but just fell together for the purpose of forming a band.  Very sad.  The movie is totally unwatchable when Hanks or Tyler are not on screen.   The other characters are not fleshed out, perhaps deliberately, and are just boring.  The title song, very ingratiating at first, gradually becomes annoying after many playings.  This is intentional because the musicians themselves tire of playing it constantly and want to move onto something else. This film could have used some comedy. The dramatic moments felt heavy-handed and, despite the considerable charisma of Hanks and Tyler, the light comedy potential was never exploited."
"MartinHafer","7","2","4","15 July 2006"," Charming homage to the early 1960s
","This film is a very slight film that probably won't change your life or have you announcing that it's the greatest thing you have ever saw. But, it is still worth seeing--particularly if you'd like to see a little slice of life film about the early 1960s and the burgeoning rock and roll industry. The movie is about a fictional singing group that called itself the ""Oneders""--a poor choice in names as although they pronounce it ""wonders"", many of the confused fans call them the ""O-needers""! Anyway, despite the poor choice of names, this young local boys perform a song called ""THAT THING YOU DO"" and it becomes a smash sensation--catapulting them to instant, and very brief, stardom. How this journey occurs and how they all ultimately deal with this is what makes the film worth seeing. The characters actually seemed pretty realistic and likable--not just caricatures like you see in some films. A good, fun film for the whole family with enough going for it to held your interest."

","I get this movie. And i like this movie, i would give it a 7.5 but i cant. I think all of the actors were rather good and I'm surprised none of them have made it in Hollywood. Liv Tyler is a super cutie might i add. I also think the set production team nailed every detail of the era, it made the movie feel very authentic. and that's what this is- its a story that may not be true per say, but it is soo real and authentic to rock and roll/music industry in the early 60s.
BUT
I kinda don't think this movie works on all levels. The rising action is literally an hour and a half. For an hour and a half i kept wondering what was going to happen... The climax happened rather abruptly, and came a bit too late in my opinion. But i suppose thats how these things happen. Thats life!"

This was something he had been formulating in his mind during the promotion of Forest Gump. It would be fair to assume after all the great films he had starred in, Tom would know what it takes to make a great movie.... remember he wrote this after starring in the epic Forest Gump.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this film is bland as beige paint. Nothing is really wrong with the way it looks or the acting, but nothing is right about this picture. It lacks any kind of spark or magic star dust that Hanks experiences regularly on set.<br/><br/>How on earth could he think this film would be fascinating, exciting or even interesting? The plot is perfectly straight and narrow, with no twists or turns. It takes no risks or explores any off shoots ... it simply goes straight ahead without even glancing around for a single memorable moment.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is a fantastic actor, who stars in legendary films and yet for some reason wrote a mundane, uninspiring flick, that is so easy going, you could go to sleep for 45minutes, wake up and immediately pick the story back up.<br/><br/>A college film would likely have more imagination than this waste of reel.<br/><br/>Pointless"

","Inspired by the success of The Beatles, a group of friends try to make it big on the music scene in the mid-1960s in this film written and directed by Tom Hanks. The Academy Award nominated title song is very catchy (and probably should have won the Oscar over 'Evita') and some of the band's other tunes are decent, yet the biggest sell-point here is all the parallels to The Beatles, including a similar involvement in the motion picture industry; the film is very cleverly done in this regard. There are less hurdles than one might expect though as the band rise upwards. Their first manager (who meets them in a rundown van) seems a little fishy, but turns out to have a heart of gold, and same goes twice over for their second manager, played by Hanks himself, who lectures them about treating their girlfriends right and so forth. In short, everyone is a little too pure at heart for the film to have any real edge; there is no producer trying to sell them short as in 'The Harder They Come' and all the messages about not letting fame get to their heads are fairly simplistic. Still, there is much to enjoy in the music and genuine 1960s ambiance that Hanks manages to recreate as writer-director, plus a running gag involving their misspelled band name is funny each time. This is an undeniably pleasant look at the music industry of yesteryear even if it lack a bit as a drama."

","Ah the fabulous 60's. The days of AM radio and which musical group will produce the number one song in the country on the top 40 survey. Garage bands were commonplace as the Fab Four (The Beatles) set the standard for music in that colorful era beyond Camelot and the Kennedy's. Much like the movie Radio Days, Woody Allen's period piece from the War years, this film acts like a time capsule as we look into the past and get a taste of what it's like to be alive in the 1960's. Tom Hanks does an outstanding job re-creating an era of rock and roll groups aspiring to cut a record and go on to greatness. The music industry was at it's paramount in that period with endless artists taking a grab at the brass ring. Our story originates from Erie, Pennsylvania in 1964 as a jazz drummer/ appliance salesman in his father's store Guy Paterson (Tom Everett Scott) is asked by his friend Jimmy Mattingly (Johnathon Schaech) to join his group because his current drummer broke his arm.The other two members of the band The ONE- DERS are an obnoxious guitar player Lenny (Steve Zahn) and a soon to be Marine base player. The group enters a local talent show as Guy suggests to his bandmates to quicken the pace in their tune. The result; a hit song is born. They win first prize, a gig at a restaurant. At the venue the One-Ders sell their records as a local talent scout takes notice Phil Horace (Chris Ellis). Phil takes that song and puts it on the radio as the group hires him as their manager. Phil books the boys for a Rock & Roll show in Pittsburgh. Phil introduces the group to Mr. White (Tom Hanks) Playtone Records representative and takes over as their new manager. The boys join a cross country tour with the Playtone cavalcade of stars doing mostly State fairs. I was totally blown away with the endless creativity of the fictitious Artists and their music. Besides our main attraction the One-ders, you have this suave debonair Freddy Fredrickson (Robert Torti) singing Mr. Downtown and the lovely vocalist Diane Dane (Chaille Percival). Fifteen original songs were written for this rock and roll fairy tale. Four of the fifteen songs were written by our jack of all trades Tom Hanks who did it all among-st the ranks of Orson Wells, Jerry Lewis and Woody Allen as a five toll producers of films, .The Playtone troupe travels westward state by state. In Ohio the Boys now re-spelled the WONDERS are dressed in red jackets to match the Buckeye colors and in Indiana beige wheat colored blazers are the norm. Wisconsin the Yellow jackets are worn to resemble cheese as Mr. White give his repetitive complimentary remark, ""Did I tell you you guys look great in Green!"" As the tour progresses Their song rises on the top 40 which Mr. White suggests they get off the tour and head out to Hollywood to bigger things. A cameo in a Beach Movie and radio interview conducted by Clint Howard. Meanwhile there's trouble in paradise as the boys have first class accommodations at luxury hotel with know it all doorman attentive Lamarr (Obba Babatunde) giving advice when needed. Jimmy clashes with Mr. White about writing his own songs while the bass player wanders off to Disney never to return. Guy ends up at a jazz club to meet his Idle Jazz artist Del Paxton (Bill Cobbs) who gives him advise telling Guy to save his money and look out for fast women.Del goes on about the industry and it's pitfalls. Silly Lenny plays cards with some locals and falls for a pretty receptionist. The first of many. Things unravel further as Faye (Liv Tyler) Jimmy's girlfriend who's relationship has been one sided on Faye's part realizes that her beau is self absorbed in his music and has no intentions of Marriage. So many cameo appearances by familiars in the industry. Charlize Theron as Tina, Kevin Pollock as the Pittsburgh MC , old friend from the TV show Bosom Buddies Peter Scolari as the Host of the Hollywood Showcase and Alex Rocco as Sol Siler the pastrami eating Playtone CEO. So ingenious. The movie shows how fragile holding on to success can be in the entertainment industry. Can't wait for the next one hit Wonder!"

","Tom Hanks is a real steamroller who goes well and mighty. He did many great movies and he seems to do no wrong. Yet, here he seemed to be all correct again, with this funny little film of a young band getting famous and then falling apart due to several factors all gotten together at one place. Here, the story seems to be OK, yes, as a drummer I do support all those technical difficulties the band encountered and all those conflicts they had. Yes, the studio / TV / gig routines are shown pretty well. Yes, the band seems to be very real, they play as if the actors play all their parts themselves. Yes, Liv Tyler and Charlize Theron are gorgeous sexy ladies. Yes, the band is a very funny gang often. And then, many NO's follow. No, the characters do not endear or grab you by their struggles or triumphs. No, the love line does not seem to be deep or decent. No, the final conflict does not smack of being real and mundane. It seems that Hanks tried very hard to slide along the surface without diving any deeper. There is no deep slant drilling of main heroes, there's only some sweet light slight tiny touches upon their psyche. This is a light little teen comedy with a very large chunk of certain shallowness and naivety, seemingly all coming from blurred recollections of Mr. Hanks himself. Oh, and I am sorry but does Mr. Zahn not irritate with his character all through. This obvious shallowness of all four main heroes seems extremely annoying, and this fluffy-puffy sweetness of Liv's Faye leaves nothing but a cloy of too sweet candy. Where Hanks succeeded is in biting certain sides of TV / cinema routine. Where he fails is depicting band's true evolution. And oh, all those jazz sentiments, they are so out of place that one can only rub their eyes in utter shock. Yeah, the overall feeling of very lightweight teen pop comedy never left me. It was nice, it was sweet. Decent or deep it was not. My rating - 7 Nice try, but not more"

The soundtrack is one of the best cinematic elements in the movie and it really is one of the most enjoyable soundtracks I have heard so far.

We follow along as they rise to success, promoting their new single all over the country and achieve national fame.

In fact, at first, Hanks didn't even want him in the movie because he felt he looked too much like him, but his wife convinced him otherwise. The rest of the supporting cast includes Liv Tyler, as the girlfriend of the band's lead singer, Steve Zahn as the guitar player and Tom Hanks as the band's manager, Mr. White.<br/><br/>This is a nice feel-good movie, perfect for a Sunday evening when you just feel like lying on the couch and enjoy a great movie.

Tom Hanks as usual was great. I think one of the best things about Tom Hanks is his willingness to be part of an ensemble cast - and he is so good at that. The guys in the band were all great. Specially liked Steve Zahn who was hilarious. Lots of fun at concerts and on stage performance with the band. Also thought Liv Tyler was magnificent. Great performance by her and as always, quite beautiful. I'd like to see more movies like this that rely on character, script, and story, rather than the digital effects department."

","As many people have said, it's an homage to a simpler time. Love the small visual nods to ""A Hard Day's Night"" with the boys running through the simulation of the states.

Of course, Lennon was actually engaged, if not already married!<br/><br/>I truly don't get tired of this film. Just a feel-good movie. Also liked everything I read about how Hanks insisted that the actors learn to play their instruments well enough to look good in the film. Some of them practiced several hours a day.<br/><br/>It's fun to see his wife pop in as a waitress where there's good jazz. Such a seemingly fun woman - but what else would you expect from Tom Hanks' wife? No, it didn't win any awards. But it's a 'keeper'. Watch it. Such fun!"

","This movie doesn't so much have a plot as a trajectory. Nevertheless, it is better to see it yourself than to know where it is going. Suffice it to say that it is about a rock band, and how its members, friends and family respond to its success. As such, it is in the slice-of-life genre. <br/><br/>Given its nearly 2 and a half hour length on the directors cut that I saw, and recommend, it works remarkably well. After awhile, I wondered if something would happen, some disaster or twist of fate, some bad guy to thicken the plot, and noticed the movie was rather long. But I wasn't bored at all, and was enjoying seeing the story unfold. In the end, the length was just right. <br/><br/>Also, I am not a rock fan, so I was a bit skeptical. It didn't matter. In the wrong hands, this could have turned into Partridge Family cornball. But it is solid. <br/><br/>To all this, Tom Hanks deserves the credit as writer, director, and low- key star, who appears late in the movie. It's a first class job. Not an earth shaking masterpiece, but a well-crafted, thoroughly enjoyable movie. <br/><br/>I am a stickler for anachronisms in movies like this. This is a period piece set in Erie, Pennsylvania, circa 1964. The Sixties was a fluid time, where the culture changed every two years; 1964 was different from 1960, 1962, 1966 and 1968. The fact that one of the band members enlists in the Marines, without any mention of Vietnam, is a good measure of the mood and innocence of 1964, versus 1966, when the war had become politicized. America was at its best around this time, and it was all downhill from there. <br/><br/>The movie captured the spirit of this window of time. Tom Hanks was 8 at the time, so he could not rely solely on memory, and must have done some historical research to fully understand the period. Whoever was in charge of props did a fantastic job of assembling lots of appliances, radios, recording gear and lots of cars. This is a movie that got it right. I loved when Skitch handed out pocket transistor radios to everyone in the band - back then an AM radio would have cost about $10 to $15, very expensive at the time, about $50 or more in today's dollars. <br/><br/>The only anachronism I found was when Skitch tells a customer the appliance is available in avocado. Avocado was a notoriously common kitchen appliance color in the 1970s; I see it was introduced by GE in 1966, but became a tidal wave around 1968-1970. It was one of those fashion things, a late Dating Game chic, when all of a sudden everything was avocado green (or harvest gold), color coordinated so people could have an entire kitchen of avocado, lucky you!. And then avocado, predictably, disappeared. I found a post, ""The Death of Avocado"" that observed it was a mistake to put a trendy color on a long-life appliance, which looked obnoxious after coordinating avocado room decor disappeared. No kidding. I was just a kid at the time, but I could see that coming. <br/><br/>See how sensitive the cultural timeline is for the Sixties? Actually, I would say what most people think of as the Sixties began around 1963-64, with the Beatles and the period of this film, and lasted till Nixon's resignation in 1974 (although some place the beginning of change at 1959). After that, the years unfolded in a homogeneous miasma, distinguished mainly by the gradual introduction of new technology, like the VCR, the Walkman and cordless phone sizes.<br/><br/>That an appliance color was the only missed stitch in the movie indicates just how good it was!<br/><br/>The acting all round was excellent. There were no caricatures, even with the doorman at the LA hotel, who had some real depth to his role. And, although I read here there were pro musicians actually dubbing the music, the actors were totally convincing that they were the ones making the music. <br/><br/>""That Thing You Do"" fits most closely the mold of ""Breaking Away,"" which also featured a cast of talented young actors, and a skeptical, practical father representing the secure, dull path. Both are about life, dreams and fallibility. They both offer a lesson for young people. And in both, in the end, they turn a corner and life goes on. <br/><br/>This is an enjoyable, memorable and thoughtful film."
"JamesHitchcock","7","0","0","10 June 2010"," Joyous Optimism
","That Thing You Do!"" was Tom Hanks' first, and to date only, film as writer and director. It is set in the summer of 1964 and tells the story of the rise and fall of a rock band. (Hanks is known for his love of classic rock). The four young men involved bear certain similarities to The Beatles, although they are not from Liverpool but from Erie, Pennsylvania. The title is also that of the group's first hit single, although for some reason the film title is spelt with and the record title without an exclamation mark.<br/><br/>The four are Jimmy Mattingly, Lenny Haise, Guy Patterson and ""T. B. Player""- we never learn his real name; those initials simply stand for The Bass Player. (The surnames ""Haise"" and ""Mattingly"" are references to the film ""Apollo XIII"" in which Hanks also starred; Fred Haise was one of the astronauts on Apollo XIII, and Ken Mattingly should have flown on the mission but had to withdraw through illness). Guy, the drummer, is a late replacement for the original drummer who is injured in a road accident. The four together form a group called ""The Oneders"", pronounced ""The Wonders"" but frequently mispronounced as the ""oh-NEE-ders"". The choice of name was based on the theory that all successful groups, like The Beatles, should have a deliberate misspelling in their name. (To judge from The Byrds, The Monkees and Led Zeppelin, there might be something in this theory).<br/><br/>The Oneders achieve quick success. They win a local talent show, release a single of ""That Thing You Do"", start getting paying gigs and are eventually signed up by a major record company named Play-Tone Records. The Wonders (by now the spelling of their name has been simplified) tour state fairs across the Midwest and their record enters the Billboard Top 100. When the song enters the Top 10, Play-Tone arrange for the group to appear on a prime-time variety show on national television.<br/><br/>Then it all goes wrong. It generally does. It is something of a cliché in films about fictitious showbiz acts that early success has to be paid for in later failure or disillusionment. A good example is the 1970s British film ""Stardust"" about a rock idol who ends up an unhappy, drug-addicted recluse. The Wonders do not fall from grace in quite such a spectacular fashion but a series of disagreements lead to their splitting up soon after their television debut; their choice of name proves to have been sadly prophetic as they end up as no more than one-hit wonders. A written epilogue tells us what became of the four members in later years. (This device was possibly borrowed from ""American Graffiti"", another film about young men of this period).<br/><br/>The film's great strength is the way in which it conjures up the spirit of the sixties and the joyous optimism of the popular music of the period. Films about pop music do not always achieve this- The Stray Cats, the fictitious band in ""Stardust"", might be based upon The Beatles but certainly don't sound like them and the music provided for them to play is generally dull and lacklustre. The music in this film, however, is a much more convincing imitation of sixties pop, and ""That Thing You Do"" itself is a cheerfully catchy number that would not disgrace Lennon and McCartney themselves. The film's most memorably joyful scene is the one where Guy and his friends start singing and dancing while listening to the song on the radio in his father's electrical appliance store where he works.<br/><br/>The film's main weakness is that it neglects character development, so we do not really understand the tensions which lead to the group's splitting up. It is never really explained why Jimmy, who has hitherto seemed the most serious of the four about the band and his music, should suddenly behave like such a jerk towards both the record company and his girlfriend Faye. (Or, for that matter, why the record company- as we learn in the epilogue- should have given him a second chance with a new band). It is never explained why Faye should have got together with Guy so soon after splitting up with Jimmy or why Guy 's earlier girlfriend Tina should have become the only woman in recorded history to dump a rock musician for a dentist. It is never explained why Lenny should have walked out on the group to elope with a former Bunny girl. (Wouldn't his obviously mercenary new wife have been happier with a successful rock star than with an unsuccessful ex-rock star?) And why was the character of the bass player left so underdeveloped? None of this, however, is the fault of the four young actors who play the members of the group. Although none of them has gone on to become a real household name- perhaps ironically in view of the fact that the film is about a band who fail to find lasting success- they all play their parts here very well. The two actors who have gone on to become famous are the two female leads, Liv Tyler as Faye and Charlize Theron as Tina, neither of whom make much impact in the film itself.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, the lack of credible characters may not be the fault of Tom Hanks either. I understand that in 2007 he released an extended director's cut of the movie; although I have never seen this I understand that it is more than half an hour longer than the theatrically released version and that it does concentrate more on character development. The weaknesses of the version I recently saw on British television, therefore, might be due to over-enthusiastic pruning for theatrical release. I therefore award the film a provisional 7/10, with the option of revising that once I have seen Hanks' version."

","A garage band in Erie, PA loses their drummer to a broken arm, where Everett Scott steps in and takes over, picking up the pace on a song originally meant to be a ballad.

This is the first time I've seen this film and I wished I would have seen it earlier. I don't know why, but it just didn't appeal to me, but I sat down earlier this morning and watched it. Following the band was easy throughout the film and the heartache everyone faces in their respective careers tugged a little bit at my heartstrings.<br/><br/>Hands down, one of the better movies in 1996, a time when I was trying to pick myself up and dust myself off, and a time when I should have taken the time to sit down and actually watch this film, instead of waiting almost thirteen years.<br/><br/>Oh, and about my opening summary, the one thing that could have made this movie a little better for people just as old as me or a little older would have been a scene where the ""Bosom Buddies"" co-stars, writer Hanks and Peter Scolari, could have appeared together.

It's not to the end when Guy Patterson (Nicely played by Tom Everett Scott) Grows up as well. This movie shows us a age that most of us had forgotten or never knew existed to most people the sixties music scene was The Beatles or the British invasion or..Woodstock. Tom Hanks quietly reminds us that this was not so. This is a America where JFK was president Working on Sunday was simply unthinkable and Rock and Roll was starting to come into it's own as The soundtrack for a generation. The story could be clichéd but in Hanks's Able hands it becomes Magic. The local Band needs a drummer after their drummer breaks his hand and so they recruit Guy Patterson the son of a local furniture store owner and Guy a lifelong Jazz fan joins them. The leader is a moody young man named Jimmy and in the Wonders first show his slow Ballad That thing you do is Turned into a Rocking number by Guy and it becomes a Major Fan fave. Soon that Thing you do becomes a hit record and the Wonders MUST adjust to the temptations of fickle fate. Tom Hanks role of the record company talent scout/manager/mentor is wonderfully underplayed This is not his movie and he knows it having written and produced and Directed that thing you do. Hanks knows this movie belongs to the Wonders and he gives them enough room to grow. The music is totally original but sounds as if it came from a Rock-Ola time machine jukebox. Hanks makes no missteps in this one. This is a wonderfully thought out story. This movie was to me a love letter to a bygone age that we will never see again.

","The film is undoubtedly well made, with all the advantages of a decent budget and a talented, and often experienced personnel; it looks good and the portrayal of the early 60's media circus is interesting, but the story and characters are pretty formulaic and predictable, with conventions such as the cheeky, funny one who chases after women (original role model Harpo Marx?), the happy, wisecracking black doorman and the really cool veteran musician... I wont say what's predictable about their respective contributions to the narrative, because I suppose that would count as a spoiler, but if you've seen a few biopics, romantic comedies or Disney takes on how nice the world is, you'll be able to work it out for yourselves! After all, I don't want to be a politically correct kill-joy, and I understand that not all films have to make reference to interesting historical/social ironies, but to show two happy black stereotypes without a nod to the inequality of the values of the record company majors of the time seems glossy to a fault. There were elements of American Graffiti peeping through the characterisations, I suppose, but this film, whilst having comparable style, lacks substance, like a meringue."

","The humble beginnings,meteoric rise and equally quick descent of a band of average,perceivably clean-cut kids from semi-rural Pennsylvania is the entire premise behind this movie,which boasts the movie directorial debut of Tom HAnks(his only film directorial job to date). While I cannot claim this a wonderful,masterful film,it was certainly good enough for me to give it multiple viewings.<br/><br/>The central hero is Guy Paterson(Tom Everett Scott,congenial and average and thus perfect for the role),a JAzz-loving drummer who works in his dad's appliance store. HE is the central architect of the band ""THe ONe-ders""(And there's plenty of pronunciation goofs awaiting that!),which latch onto the burgeoning rock scene with a few popular tracks that get local airplay. When the band,consisting of guitarists Lenny(Steve ZAhn,never out of a job),T.B.(Ethan Embry)and lead singer Jimmy(JOnathan Schaech) get spotted by an enigmatic-yet-paternal music representative named White(HAnks,at full ease),their star progressively rises to the point where their demand goes national and their egos grow in separate ways. IN the mix are the lead singer's sensitive and naive girlfriend(Liv Tyler)and the spoiled Barbie-doll hanger-on(CHarlize Theron,who almost slips through the cracks of this film).Of course,the lead singer being an egotistical ass and Guy being a sensitive,recessive fellow,the budding romance is as predictable as the weather. <br/><br/>HAnks' sympathy for the era as screenwriter and director,goes a long way to making this easy to watch. Ditto the casting of then mostly unknown younger actors to fill out the major roles. There is the perfect balance of bright,wide-eyed optimism of youngster wanting to be the next big thing in rock 'n roll and the reality of the business that makes this film neither sugary or cynical. I could nitpick as to elements that made this movie imperfect,but I'd just as soon not,since this movie has such a friendly,unique quality that I'd feel remiss in picking on it. While you need not be either an aficionado of 1960s rock and/or be from that era,it certainly wouldn't hurt in order to enjoy this movie. Or at the very least,this should appeal to the sentimentalist in anyone."

"Isaac5855","8","0","0","1 February 2007"," An Impressive Directorial Debut for Tom Hanks
","THAT THING YOU DO! was a warm and affectionate valentine to the world of pop music in the 1960's which marked the directorial debut of two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks. Hanks lovingly examines a phenomenon that was practically an epidemic in the music world in the 60's...the ""One-Hit Wonder."" This film is the story of a garage band in a small town who call themselves The Oneders who have perfected a nice little ballad called ""That thing you do."" The night they perform the song publicly for the first time, the drummer doubles the tempo and, as an up tune, the song is a smash. They record it and it even gets radio play. The group then meets a Mr. White (Hanks), who agrees to manage the group and get them national exposure. He changes their name to The Wonders because they keep getting introduced as ""The Oneeders"" and books them on tours of state fairs and even gets them on TV and in a beach party movie, all on the strength of this one song, but when the group pressures White to make another record, that's where the problems begin. This movie accurately portrays the way a musical act in the 60's was able to catapult to stardom on the strength of one record and then disappear forever. The film is beautifully mounted, with imaginative direction by Hanks and Oscar-worthy art and costume design. Tom Everett Scott lights up the screen as Guy, the drummer whose change of tempo changes the lives of the group forever. The film also features impressive turns by Jonathan Schaech as the arrogant lead singer, Steve Zahn as the fun-loving empty-headed guitarist and Liv Tyler as Schaech's girlfriend. Take note of my favorite scene in the film where the members of the group hear their song on the radio for the very first time...the joy depicted here is infectious as is this film, which proved to be an impressive directorial debut for Tom Hanks."

It's hip and square at the same time and that damn song, played again and again in pleasing variations, is exactly right. The casting of the band mates, notably Jonathan Schaech (a wannabe Lennon or Dylan), Steve Zahn (a Ringo kind of goof) and Tom Everret Scott, a young Hanks lookalike, who has artistic jazz-minded desires, make for an ensemble that is heartfelt, real and friendly-- oh, and Ethan Embry plays the bass player. Hanks himself gives one of his best, and most understated, performances as the band's big-time producer/Svengali and Liv Tyler is the lead singer's perfect girlfriend, Faye -- ""Well, Faye's special"", says Hanks himself at one point and we know, any one who's been around a rock'n'roll band knows, he's right. Light, airy, kind of weird -- all the terrific (as well as the terrifically awful music -- ""Lovin' You Lots and Lots"" by the Norm Wooster Singers) is original to the film -- ""That Thing..."", even as it falters a little in its final third, makes you happy to watch a movie that its players and its makers are more than giddy to present."

I've known more than one musician who put all his emotions into his music, leaving little or none for the people in his life -- in this movie, it's Jimmy. I've known guys who are so self-absorbed that they don't realize that women are drawn to them and then brushed away -- Guy ignores his girlfriend's chatter in his own excitement, and later, as a waitress tells him her life story, he's obviously just waiting for her to stop talking.<br/><br/>And I've been the girl ready to follow her musician anywhere, singing along with every note he sings. Poor Fay -- she really thought Jimmy loved her.<br/><br/>It's interesting that Guy and Fay end up together -- for the first time in the movie, he's actually listening to what a woman is saying to him. And from the ""follow-up"" at the end of the movie, they apparently have a good life together, so maybe he just needed to have the right woman talking to him.<br/><br/>But all these observations are so neatly written that you don't feel like you're taking a course in character analysis -- they just make the movie that much more interesting to watch."

They did a great job of depicting what '60's teenagers in America were like - a much more innocent & naive world view than that possessed by kids today. Tom Hanks also did a nice job in a limited, for him, role. He adds a little real world experience in contrast to the idealistic Wonders. The movie is worth watching for the soundtrack alone! Unlike George Lucas's ""American Graffitti"", the soundtrack here consisted entirely of works written specifically for the ""That Thing You Do"". This serves to give you the feeling that you are discovering the music of the Wonders along with the rest of the country. It's not just another re-hashing of golden oldies. The new old hits played in this movie help to create a world very similar to what really happened, yet different. The Wonders become a real group, playing their songs, rather than the millionth rendition of ""Johnnie B. Good"". If I hadn't known better, I would have sworn that the songs played by the Wonders and the other acts in the movie were actual hit songs from the '60's. The music really fit the times. It's a fun, enjoyable movie. I would recommend it for anyone!"

","THAT THING YOU DO! **** Script-writer, director, and supporting star Tom Hanks takes us to the golden 1960s era when a local band in need of a drummer asks Tom Everett Scott to be a fill-in for a Saturday night gig at a high school prom. As the band's popularity increases, formed from their widely-liked single ""That Thing You Do,"" the story takes them on a tour across the American coast where they expose their rock 'n' roll music to the world. Hanks sustains the film's momentum and entertainment through its entire running with his fresh, humorous script, solid direction, and comedic performance in the film. Nineteen-year-old Liv Tyler is terrific as the loyal girlfriend of band leader Johnathon Schaech who tags along for the ride. And viewers even get to hear a couple jazz numbers. I enjoyed every part of this film."

","I understood why Hanks thought his ego had gone overboard when I first saw it. However, I liked it then and appreciate its subtleties as it passes by all these years later on cable. It has quite a few elements I missed the first time around because the song and the attention to '60s detail had me reliving my childhood. There is something irrepressibly elating about the affect the meteoric rise of the song has on young people from a somewhat remote town in PA. I wonder how many people my age daydreamed about something like that happening to them? And the scene when they first hear their song over the radio evokes memories of soaring joy on those rare occasions when something came out so right. The warning from Del Paxton to Guy about bands was nice scripting. I can't imagine it working as well if it had a more in-depth message."

Always nice to see Bill Cobbs, here as ""legendary jazz great Del Paxton"" - Cobbs has been in 65 films in the last 20 years, I know him as Orvis in The Color of Money (""Orvis, last time I saw you you were sweeping up in McGears"").

","Tom Hanks gives another brilliant performance, this time as a band manager for a fictional record company.<br/><br/>A group of small town teens from Erie Pennsylvania have an amazing sound and a catchy song that gets Hanks attention. He weans them along slowly while the lead singer thinks it is too slow. As their popularity grows (and they take the name The Wonders), the lead singer's patience wanes and he feels too big for his girlfriend (Liv Tyler), who has stood by him through the band's struggles to get to the top. As he pushes her away, she drifts more towards the band's drummer, who seems to be the most caring of the group.<br/><br/>The movie has an amazing scene where the drummer goes to a ""jazz"" club and meets his all time idol, who turns out to be a regular guy and not the prima donna that the Wonders' lead singer is.<br/><br/>Though the groups and the songs were made for the movie, they all sound like they could have been made in the 60's and would have been definite hits!

","This is my most favorite movie of all time! Not only is the writing and acting phenomenal, but it's got wonderful (excuse the pun) music too. Tom Hanks did an amazing job with this screenplay. The characters are well developed (except for the bass player, he didn't even have a name!)and aptly portrayed on screen. Tom Everette Scott gives amazing life to the Jazz lovin' character of Guy ""shades"" Patterson. A role many critics saw as a role Hanks himself would have played 15 or 20 years ago. <br/><br/>Liv Tyler is beautiful in her portrayal as Faye, the girlfriend of James Mattingly (Johnathan Schaech) the talented, but somewhat self-indulged, narcissistic lead singer. Steve Zahn is just hilarious as Lenny, the goofball, womanizer who can't get a date, guitar player. In my opinion he has the funniest lines in the movie. And pretty much steals whatever scene he is in. Tom Hanks of course is fantastic as the bands manager (c'mon when isn't he fantastic?) Then There's Ehtan Embery who gives startling empathy to T.B. Player (The bass player). A some what ""dim bulb"" who joins the marines right before the wonders hit it big, and disappears right before the bands appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show. This is the one part of the movie I didn't understand. Why was the bass player given no name. as one point in the movie Tom Hanks says ""Where's your bass player"" he doesn't even no his name, no one does for that matter, interesting. I wonder if that was a conscious choice, or something that just ""evolved"" Nonetheless, this movie is a superb slice of Americana from the early 60's. Great writing, superb acting, wonderful music; if it doesn't make you want to run out and join a band, I don't know what will."

","This movie just worked.  I remember seeing this in the theater a few years ago and falling in love with Guy Patterson from Eerie, PA, as well as all the classic Wonder Songs.<br/><br/>This movie is about four boys from a little town in PA trying to make the big time.  You have the handsome and talented lead singer Jimmy, the easy-going, yet totally charming Percussion player Guy (Shades!) the funny-in-a-dumbass way guitarist Lenny, and let us not forget the airheaded Bass Player.  They start out in Jimmy's garage singing a slow ballad called That Thing You Do and decide its good enough to play in a contest.  They are up on stage and all of a sudden Guy gets an idea and starts playing That Thing You Do a few notches too fast.  The next thing you know you have a up-tempo 50's classic which makes these boys rich and famous, even if its only for a little while.<br/><br/>This movie is all about living in the moment.  It also gives the audience a little taste of what its like in the Music World, and how some people would do anything to get their fifteen minutes of fame.  In the end, The Wonders are no more, but they are remembered, and the result is a beautiful love story.  10/10"

Brilliant character portrayals by Tom Everett Scott, Johnathon Schaech, Liv Tyler, and Ethan Embry (whose character lacks a name.

I liked how he cast a bunch of unknown and semi-star actors at the time, with the exception of Liv Tyler and Chris Isaak.  Obviously, he made some good choices as most have moved on to bigger and better things.<br/><br/>This was a wonderful story of a local ""garage band"" go from being unknown and rise to the top.  I liked how you heard ""That Thing You Do"" evolve from a slow ballad, to a raw song with lots of potential, to the smash hit rock song that it became.  <br/><br/>Another thing I liked was, there wasn't a lot of ""name dropping"" in the movie, in terms of other bands, artists, etc, with the exception of Virgil ""Gus"" Grissolm and Gina Lollobrigda.  It would've been easy to do so, but it wasn't done and the writing was good in the sense that they seemed believable.<br/><br/>A few bits of trivia from this movie:  Some things you already know and some maybe you don't.<br/><br/>-The bass player (Ethan Embry) was never given a name.  In the movie, he's referred as ""the bass player"" and in the end credits his name is T.B. Player.<br/><br/>-Tom Hanks' wife and 2 of his kids appear in this movie.  Rita Wilson played Marguerite, the cocktail waitress in the jazz club, his son Colin was the page who escorted Liv Tyler when the Wonders appeared on the Hollywood Showcase and his daughter Elizabeth was the bored girl in the dress shop. <br/><br/>
-Is it a coincedence that 2 of the main characters in this movie, Lenny Haise and Jimmy Mattingly, had the same last names as Fred Haise and Ken Mattingly from Tom Hanks' previous movie ""Apollo 13""?<br/><br/>-The record label in this movie, ""Play Tone"" records and the logo is the name of Tom Hanks' production company."

","Previous reviews explain the movie and characters pretty well; I want to add one writer's point of view.<br/><br/>This story was obviously a labor of love for Tom Hanks. Had he not had the Hollywood pull that he enjoys at this point in his career, the project would never have seen the light of day. Most films emerging from this process are, quite frankly, crap. But this is Tom Hanks we're talking about; the man is incapable of doing anything at less than outstanding levels of quality, and he often achieves greatness.<br/><br/>""That Thing You Do"" is merely outstanding, but it allows Hanks to be outstanding while wearing five different hats. The more cynical point out that it covers little new ground. I would disagree -- I found it refreshingly daring that in an era where the public insists that some barrier be broken before a piece is considered to be worthwhile, Hanks had the fortitude (and power) to see this through and get it made.<br/><br/>Furthermore it set the stage, five years before 9/11, for less-in-your-face fare to be embraced by those seeking more in the way of feel-good entertainment.<br/><br/>The world is a teaspoonful of better because this film is available to us. The world of movies could probably claim a gallon. But you're in no danger of getting a cavity from seeing it. For that, I recommend ""The Lizzie McGuire Movie""."

","I love this movie!  When I have a bad day or have the ""blues"" I slap this movie in and enjoy not just the great music but the great interaction between the leading cast members which include Hanks' look-a-like Tom Everett Scott, Steve Zahn, Jonathan Schaech and as notated in the credits: ""The Bass Player"" Ethan Embry, collectively known as ""The Oneders"", oops! make that ""The Wonders"".   Hanks show us just how multi-talented he is by writing and directing this movie PLUS he re-created the innocence and joy of music from the 60's in minute detail. Hanks is the writer of the title song and of the offbeat instrumental ""Spartacus"" and it knocks me out that he has these incredible talents for so many artistic creations: Actor, Director, song writer, et.al. He also directs this movie as well as playing Play-Tone Manager, ""Mr White"" who leads the ""The Wonders"" to success through the ""Play-Tone"" label. Tom Everett Scott looks a lot like Tom Hanks during his ""Bosom Buddy"" days on TV, and I suspect that Hanks created this movie to showcase the talent that is Tom Everett Scott.  Scott steals the movie with his humor, his sincere caring of others and if he is really a drummer, his talent! Zahn was great as the comic relief and Schaech was not only very handsome but very believable in portraying the moody Jimmy, lead singer, who has the true artistic temperament but is lacking in certain sensitivities. The songs are ""snappy"" and ""catchy"", capturing the true zenith of rock and roll in 1960's America.  The catchy ""Play-Tone"" label, also created by Hanks, the reproductions of TV shows of the 60's, and the ambience of a time when rock and roll was growing up and showing off are all in this great movie.  The title song, ""That Thing You Do"" is actually a great tune and I find myself wanting to hear it now and then, and sing along with it. <br/><br/>   Liv Tyler as ""Faye"" was very sweet as the wronged girlfriend but I don't get how  having a really bad cold during the West coast California ""showcasing"" had any revelance to the movie except to show that ""Guy"" noticed she was sick and was always ""there"" for her and ""thinking"" of her when Jimmy wasn't. Look for performances by Charlize Theron and Giovanni Ribisi as well. This is a light-hearted movie that you can just sit back, enjoy, sing a long with, and laugh.  The biggest plus is that in watching the credits it is incredible to see that Hanks wrote many of the songs, the music, created the 60's TV shows so realistically and is not only a member of the Screen Actors Guild but also the Song Writers Guild - so many feathers in his already much-plummed hat. Does Tom Hanks' talents have no end? I hope not. Check out ""Road to Perdition"" for further proof. Rita Wilson, Hanks' wife, makes an appearance at the ""Blue Spot"" where Jazz greats meet to jam and have ""cock and bull"" sessions and where Guy meets his idol, Dale Paxton. Their own jam session results in ""Spartacus"", a great jazz instrumental, also written by Tom Hanks. Before you rewind the movie, wait for the end of the credits to see two of ""The Wonders"" music videos, including ""That Thing You Do""!<br/><br/>   In summary, I love that thing that Tom Hanks does with this well-made and entertaining comedy!"

The opening song ""Loving You Lots and Lots"" playing over the opening credits and establishing sequences really set the tone when ""Safe"" music could still be popular alongside ""evil"" rock-and-roll. I felt like I stepped into a time machine and what was really impressive to me was the fact that ALL the songs used in the movie were all originals! Not a single archive song was used to set the time frame. This little movie deserves more respect and I would love to have the Powers That Be issue a special DVD version sometime in the near future with a Tom Hanks commentary. So why a 9 and not a 10? Liv Tyler's role wasn't as solid a character as it could have been. No, not liberated as such but maybe a bit less whiny during the break up scene. I didn't really like her character untill right at the end when she and Guy get together. A very comfortable movie."

","An excellent story about a better time with better music. A small band from Erie, PA in 1964 are about to perform their ballad ""That Thing You Do"" at a local talent show. With less than a day to come up with a name, (they decide on the One-ders) their drummer breaks his arm. The replacement: ""Erie's lone beatnik"" lovable Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott). Starting the song at the talent show, Guy gets a catchy beat in his head and starts playing it. The more upbeat, ""snappier"" version of the song becomes an instant hit and the newly-named Wonders are signed to Play-Tone Records and led to huge success by their manager, Mr. White (Tom Hanks). Jimmy (Johnathon Shaech), the band's serious lead singer and songwriter insists for quite some time that it's still ""too fast"". Also in the band are Lenny (Steve Zahn), the hilarious guitarist who takes nothing seriously and is probably just in the band to meet girls. Then there's the cute bass player (Ethan Embry) who doesn't really say much and enlisted in the Marines before the band's success (he sadly has to report to South Carolina at the end of August but ends up in Disneyland). One of the running jokes of the film is that the bass player was never given a name. Liv Tyler gives a wonderful performance as Faye, Jimmy's girlfriend and the band's hugest fan (She's allowed on the tour as their ""costume mistress""). With this sudden success and a record literally climbing the charts, not to mention a part in a major motion picture, how long will the band stay together to continue doing that thing they do?"

","There is something inherently infectious about movies, theater, and television that we see where we can tell that the cast is just having a great time.  From CATS to SEX AND THE CITY, this shows.  So, what do we get in THAT THING YOU DO?  Well, it's slight, light, breezy and proud of it. Tom Hanks and his casting director have managed to find and draw surprisingly fun and energetic performances out of Steve Zahn, Ethan Embry, Liv Tyler, Rita Wilson, Tom Everett Scott, and Jonathan Schaech (sp? - burdened with playing the requiste moody and serious artiste')and out of Mr. Hanks himself.  The supporting cast is great also. Light, breezy, smiling, bouncy, and energetic."

","How my hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania got to be the setting of this movie is beyond me. But if you're going to have a movie set in Erie, PA, this was a good choice!<br/><br/>Hanks & company did quite an accurate portrayal of Erie in 1964. I wasn't around in '64, but older Erieites are extremely impressed with the mention of many local hangouts back then. It was especially nice to see a mention of a local college, Gannon (my alma mater).<br/><br/>The movie itself was very well-done. It was a nice story of an overnight success and how people take advantage of their youthful ignorance. Tom Hanks does a nice job as the manager. I like how he doesn't play the same old characters in every movie."

","I was kinda surprised I liked this movie.  I thought it was going to be cheesy, seen it before crap but it was actually a nice little flick.  It shows how fame can be enjoyable, yet fleeting and it also shows the kind of evolution a band makes from one stage to another.  All and all a decent flick.  The best part was the soundtrack.  Like a previous review mentioned, it sounds like it came straight from the 60's.  The one thing that would have made this more interesting (perhaps) was if it was in quasi-documentary style, with the drama scenes acting as ""dramatizations""."

","The first time I saw this was when I was about 9 years old. Of course I got bored when I first saw it (being an average 9 year old) but when I saw it for the second time a month ago I was truely amazed and touched!<br/><br/>The movie is about four regular guys from Erie, PA that become a success over night in their band. The movie stars five amazing and brilliant people. The people who play each member act as if they really have the personality of their charactor.<br/><br/>There is Guy Patterson (Tom Everet Scott). He plays the drummer of the band. He did a great job on acting as if he was really a drummer. There's one problem with his charactor, the whole Spartacus thing. It's hard to comprehend.<br/><br/>There's also Lenny (Steve Zahn) the goofy of the wall lead guitarist. He is so hilarious in this movie. I couldn't keep from laughing.<br/><br/>Jimmy (Johnathan Schaech) is the reluctant one. I really think Johnathan did a good job at portraying a lead singer. I did not like the charactor of Jimmy though. He ended up being a real pain in the butt at the end.<br/><br/>Let's not forget Liv Tyler. She did an excellent job at being a girl-next-door. I enjoyed her character greatly.<br/><br/>Last but not least (definately not in my book) is the bassplayer (Ethan Embry). This had to be my favorite charactor in the whole movie. I like the fact he played a shy guy. He seemed so innocent.<br/><br/>I think Tom Hanks did a wonderful job at writing, directing, and co staring in this magical movie. Bravo Mr. Hanks, and bravo to Tom Everett Scott, Steve Zahn, Jonathan Scaech, and Ethan Embry. Anyone that says they don't like this movie I'll have to say, ""Your talking gibberish..."""

Having been a teenager in the 60s and being in a ""garage"" band, played the school dances, county fairs, won the talent contests, recorded a single,(which went nowhere)and finally have the group disentigrate,(VietNam got a lot of us, myself included)I was moved to tears of both sadness and joy as I hitched a ride with those 4 young guys, Guy, Lenny, Jimmy, and T.B., in pursuit of a dream that a lot of us had in those days.I especially love the scene when they hear their song on the radio for the first time. That scene captured the raw, unadulterated exuberance of the youth of that day experiencing a dream come true. I have purchased this movie and the soundtrack and have watched and listened to them numerous times. Because of my experience of being in a ""one-hitless wonder"" band and the experience of VietNam, I have found joy and healing in this unpretentious movie of the days of my youth.

"shrine-2","10","0","0","18 January 2000"," Hanks pulls out all the stops!
","Tom Hanks pulled out all the creative stops to put his picture ""That Thing You Do"" together, and it shows--magnificently.  Audiences could confuse a movie with lightness of tone as unsubstantial, but serious subjects and heavyhandedness are not prerequisites for greatness. It's quite possible for a movie to be light and airy, or frivolous and charming, and still make a grand impression.  I won't stretch my point by saying ""That Thing You Do"" is a great movie, but it's the kind of work that pools all the pleasures of moviegoing:  laughs, music, dreams of material success, passion, romance--and serves them up in generous measure. <br/><br/>And finally, a role that allows Hanks to reveal the sharper, more creative, less lovable side of himself, that is to say, an adult--with ambition and focus and drive, a distant cousin of Tony Curtis' Sidney Falco.  Hanks takes on twin roles: publicity agent grooming a talented fledgling rock'n'roll band for stardom; and writer/director behind the camera orchestrating all the myriad ingredients that make this movie a rousing success.  He shows a sophisticated way with a wisecrack, and an equally mature facility for storytelling.<br/><br/>And hats off to Hanks for the cast he assembles! As Lenny Haise, the lead guitarist of the band, Steve Zahn could not have not have made me laugh any harder.  Mr. White may think him a fool, but Zahn's Lenny takes his place among the best of fools; Shakespeare's Falstaff or Mozart's Papageno have nothing on him.  He's the restless mover of the narrative.  Without Lenny's impulsiveness, the band would not have made the leaps and bounds it did in so short a time, and every quick step of the way Zahn makes of it heady fun.<br/><br/>The tomfoolery doesn't stop with Lenny.  Tom Everett Scott in the lead is forced into a kind of princely strait-jacket, but the actors on the sidelines like Holmes Osborne and Claudia Stedelin as Scott's parents; Kevin Pollak as Boss Vic Kosslovich, a two-bit impresario from Pittsburgh; and Alex Rocco as the blissfully crass Sol Siler leave us smiling long after the story has left them behind.  (When Rocco spits out something like ""And will someone get Fabian away from me?,"" I almost fell off the couch, doubled over with laughter.)  <br/><br/>Sort through this movie, and you'll find a gift at every turn.  It chimes in a variety of music styles, the best pop offerings coming from Adam Schlesinger (who wrote the title song), Scott Rogness, and Rick Elias with a good deal of the filler music being Hanks' collaborations.  It showcases some dazzling musical numbers--""Dance With Me Tonight"" is the centerpiece.  It sends us visions of Liv Tyler, Charlize Theron, Rita Wilson, and Kennya J. Ramsey to mull over.  And it conjures up a time when America was still at peace with itself.  Need we ask for anything more?"

","Tom Hanks is more than a great actor.  As Writer, Director, & Actor in ""That Thing You Do"" he displays his wide range of talents.  This movie can only be discribed as ENTERTAINABLY FUN!  The story follows 4, very talented, guys in a garage band, who get their big break with their<br/><br/>One-Hit-Wonder, ""That Thing You Do""   This very catchy song propells them into fame faster then you could sign a contract, and then reveals the sad and realistic misfortunes of that fame, and the fall that sometimes follows. This was a great film that gave it's audience a peek behind the music business and into the lives of these 4 ambitious boys. You can't help but cheer for them as you watch their song rise to the top of the charts. Tom Everett Scott and Liv Tyler are the ones to watch in this film, with great supporting roles by Johnathon Schaech and Steve Zahn.  And Tom Hanks is always a welcomed face to see that was an extra bonus for this charming film.  Watch it and catch the fever of ""That Thing You Do!"""

","There have been a lot of ""rags-to-riches"" garage band movies; I appreciated Tom Hanks' ""That Thing You Do"" more than any of them.  The title song plays throughout the movie, nearly a dozen times (though the whole song plays only once or twice), and it is a catchy tune indeed.  The scene at the talent show where a performer's nervousness accidently creates a hit song is pure magic.  The scene where the band hears the song on the radio for the first time is both funny and touching.  The scene that made a major impact on me, reflecting what the movie is all about, is when the audience is singing along with the band in their final appearance in the movie.  Inspirational. Tom Everett Scott, who more than once has been compared to a young Tom Hanks, makes his character likeable and funny/confused at the same time. The dual-track communication between Scott's character and his girlfriend is subtly humorous, more so in subsequent viewings. This movie is one to watch over and over, just to capture the magic of the scenes."
"Ferris-26","Null","0","0","23 October 1999"," 60`s nostalgia at its best
","One of the hardest things for writer/director Hanks whilst making this movie, must have been creating a nostalgic, brilliant, original song to base around the movie. He did just that. The title song could easily have fitted in place in the 60`s charts. Featuring a starring cast of relative unknowns, it charts the rise and fall of ""one hit wonder"" pop band, ""The Wonders"", on their quest for global domination in 1964. The bands music takes a new direction when drummer Guy (Tom Everett Scott) joins the band, to fill in for the previous ""guy"" who managed to break his arm. Guy`s upbeat attitude provides the spark they need, giving them a #7 hit single, television and radio recognition, adoring girls, and a trustworthy manager in the form of Tom Hanks. Relationships in the a band deteriorate, and so the story goes.<br/><br/>Backed up by some great music, and featuring all those 60`s cliches, its a sensitive and enjoyable look at life through the eyes of an up and coming pop band in the 60`s."

Not only does it showcase Hanks' directorial skills (and his unquestioned acting ability), but the sheer joy of his involvement is evident. Without giving in to the entertainment quotient, ``TTYD'' is a dead-on accurate portrayal of the music/radio/promotion business.

The movie, which was wonderfully entertaining and had a few good comic moments at times rolled like a documentary into the scene of the record business, and the lifestyle it provided for its brief stars. The mass hysteria was not so much from the screaming girls but the executives who thought they could send a band down the road of the Beatles ,on just one very catchy tune. Tom Hanks was excellent as the cynical Mr White, into whom he seemed to have put a lot of sincerity. The movie was instantly feelgood and it emanated a lot of energy, with the concert footage and the mass-hysteria of the fans , and the mass-hysteria of the band when they realised they were gonna hit stardom.

","Tom Hanks scores an impressive win with this touching tale of five would-be band members accidently hitting it big in the early 60's.<br/><br/>The film stars Tom Everett Scott as Guy Patterson, a employee at his father's appliance store who just happens to spend his free time playing the drums.  His skills are called upon when a small band in his hometown of Erie, PA loses their drummer (Giovanni Ribisi) to a broken arm. There's Jimmy (Jonathon Schaech), the narcissistic lead singer, Lenny (Steve Zahn), the goofy lead guitarist, and T.B. (Ethan Embry), the naive bass player. Accompanied by Fay (Liv Tyler) and their manager Mr. White (Hanks), the five members tour all across the country promoting their hit song ""That Thing You Do"".<br/><br/>The film is a cute and light look at the early 60's music scene, which saw the rise and fall of many young, one-hit wonder, bands.  If you want to spend two enjoyable hours of fun, you can't go wrong with ""That Thing You Do"".  And if you grew up in that era, the feeling of nostalgia adds an extra level of enjoyment.<br/><br/>All in all, with its excellent cast, script, music, and production design, ""That Thing You Do"" should be high on your list of rentals."

A bunch of squeaky clean middle class white all American wannabe rock and rollers with one very repetitive tune scream whenever it makes the radio station. I was screaming by the end as well. Apart from the bad acting and embarrassing dialogue ('i am Spartacus')the most offensive aspect of this drivel was the representation of the black members of Tom Hanks world. Dial a cliché because here comes the bell hop who's incredibly helpful but not with the bags but distilling wisdom and sorting out their personal probs. Sure, and in this Hanks fifties dream world the white kids really dig him and not a whiff of racism can be smelt above the perfumed presentation. Then the drummer really digs the good ole blues boys and they dig him. I know i am from UK but wasn't there some race riots or something in the US around this time. Maybe i am mistaken because according to Hanks everyone got on just fine, it was more like the Truman show than any attempt to portray truth. But this is a Hanks vehicle so one must expect the picket fence sentiment rather than the harsh reality of racial strife and racial oppression."

In the extended version he meets Guy Patterson at the hotel after he got drunk meeting Del Paxton at the Jazz Club.<br/><br/>He then leaves the hotel and gets into a car with a man who appears to be pouting and angry that Mr. White is taking so long. They have this caddy exchange about being late to a party.

But the main goal of a movie is to be entertaining, and if I just want to watch something that's going to let me have fun and escape the world for two hours, I rarely have to look further than this often overlooked masterpiece. We've all come to expect greatness from Tom Hanks, and in his directorial debut, he certainly delivers, both onscreen and behind the curtain. I firmly believe that Steve Zahn is a comedic goldmine, worthy of far more accolades than he gets, and this is his best work. The songs are catchy and reminiscent of the 60s charm they are intended to represent. It's just a great movie to have fun and sing along to.

","A ride through the music-making machine with a wholesome, mid-sixties one-hit-wonder. For years I thought I'd hate it, based on trailers and tone alone, but was pleasantly surprised. The film's got some issues, no doubt - especially the horribly tacked-on, telegraphed romantic ending - but it's got a lot of soul and I actually started to like the little tribe of stereotypes as we spent more time together. The theme song is appropriately catchy, too, without being grating like a lot of the era's pop records. Which is important, because it plays no less than once every ten minutes. There's good stuff here, with a nice leading performance from (who?) Tom Everett Scott as the band's hip, friendly drummer, but it's also clearly a learning project for writer / director / supporting actor Tom Hanks. Could've been much better with a bit of a trim and a wilder fire burning behind the lens."

","In the mid-1990s, Tom Hanks was on the top of the world. He had just won two Oscars in a row and starred in the innovative phenomenon Toy Story. Frankly, he could do just about anything he wanted. So he went ahead and made his directorial feature film debut, a love letter to an adored era, the explosion of pop music in the 1960s. That Thing You Do is a pretty routine but charming flick like an alternate Beatles fame tale. However, the story takes a pretty straight trajectory. It rises, rises, rises, keeps rises without much interruption, then there's the fall, then soft landing then credits. It suffers from lack of meaningful conflict, instead just showing the cracks til the inevitable explosion within the band. It's okay for mild entertainment, just a little bland. Wish he chose a better lead than someone who just looks like him. Steve Zahn is the only zany highlight who livens the picture up. But it all hinges onto its title song, which is very catchy, if quite 90s. The disappointing thing about the film is it doesn't explore the joy of discovery in this early pop music. Instead, kids just nod when things feel right. It needed much more energy and confidence, but it's a generally inoffensive film.<br/><br/>6/10"
"Dr_Coulardeau","8","1","2","18 November 2010"," Funny seize the day and forget about the rest
","It's a comedy about real young people from the Rock 'n Roll planet in the early 1960s. It's funny but also typically American. There are so many sharks going around looking for young teenage would-be rock stars that it is impossible not to be noticed by one, one day, not to become some one overnight and not to dissolved as soon as the top is reached. To stay at the top is really difficult. A band in those days, and in the USA, was the normal way for anyone who wanted to do some music on the stage to go around but bands did not last long. Everyone is not the Beatles or the Rolling Stones, you know. This is the story of the short-lived Wonders and yet the four boys and the one girl who were there at the first public appearance in the boonies, all eventually did something with their skin and their brains, if they had any, both skin and brains. Today that adventure still exists in the USA but it has also taken names like Myspace music, Youtube, Daily Motion and some others. Permanence of course is nothing in that business in 99% of the cases, but chance is also essential for those who have something in their veins. A career is often 50% talent and 50% chance, some would say opportunity. But the film is funny, though so banal that it should be a warning to anyone who wants to imitate these young teenagers. As the old Paxton would say: look after your money, women and a few other things of that type. Yesterday is a sure thing that existed but tomorrow is as brittle as an egg shell in front of a bulldozer. And the world is full of bulldozers crushing many eggshells down into the ground and powder.

""That Thing That You Do!"" is a marvel of a movie about a fictional boy band in the 1960's who get their big break with the help of a determined manager named Mr. White(Tom Hanks). They are know to the U.S. as The Wonders(Oneders) The band get their show on the road when Guy Patterson(Tom Everett Scott) becomes the new drummer after the original breaks his arm. They go places to perform, and Guy meets jazz drummer Del Paxton(Bill Cobbs) who warns him about bands and success. He did take heed. After the performance of a variety show, the band starts to suffer. Egos clash, and head-butting with other members split the band. Some of the members form a new band, Guy and Del start to make music of a different tone, choosing Jazz over Rock-n Roll. What started with a band, ended with a new opportunity. Hanks did a great job making this movie, Liv Tyler did a spectacular performance playing Faye Dolan. She was important to Guy, and Lamarr(Obba Babatunde) was a very resourceful and wise bellhop.

This is no Oscar contender, but is a very enjoyable take of young dreams, good friends & what can happen when unexpected success comes into play. A good choice for a weekend afternoon escape.<br/><br/>The story on how the movie came to be is from Tom Hanks & his family taking a cross-country roadtrip in the early 90s.

","I love this movie. It is one of those movies I watch if I have a bad day. It cheers me up and is so entertaining. It is meticulessly filled with nostalgic details, and silly, fun music. The characters are flawlessly played, so many good actors participated in this film. It is a fun and wholesome movie, my teenage daughter loved it too. It is even more fun if you have ever known anyone in a garage band, and who hasn't? It mirrors many events from the Ed Sullivan era when the Beatles became big. A great tale of the ""one hit wonder"". Fiction in a very historical early '60's setting. This movie represents the light, fun side of early Rock n Roll, which is often over shadowed by the cruel, senseless events of war and the fight for civil rights that was happening during this time. Tom Hanks wrote, directed, acted in it, and even was involved in writing much of the music. His wife has a small part in it as well. I remember seeing Charlize Theron for the first time in this movie and thinking what a great actress she is. Same for TB player, who never has a real name in the movie, and Tom Everett Scott. The song was actually nominated for a Grammy award, it's real catchy! I bought the movie, and the sound track and wore them out. It will be one of those movie that people will appreciated more and more as time goes on, mostly because the main cast was virtually unknown and have gone on to do greater parts. Tom Hanks said when they made the movie, it was like watching a new generation of great actors get started. If you like the movie, get the sound track and read the jacket, it was just like we used to do when a new album came out by our favorite band, we'd read the jacket and learn all the extras about them!

","""That Thing You Do"" is an excellent film on its own and Tom Hanks does yet another marvelous job as an actor in the role of a record-label rep, however, even more marvelous was the discovery that it was also a Tom Hanks production project (the first, I think). Furthermore, Hanks' production label--""Play Tone""--is also the name of the would-be record label in the movie. Discovering these parallels gave me a whole new appreciation for this movie. The film centers on a group of 5 teens (4 male musicians and the lead singer's girlfriend, Fay, who hangs with the band and helps out at gigs) who form a band in the late 50's and head to the top with their first major hit, ""That Thing You Do"". The band ecstatically leaves behind small-town Erie, Pennsylvania after offers come in and Fay accompanies them on tour under the guise of being their costume mistress. Their wide-eyed experiences outside of Erie, their naive view of the music industry and their approach to fame makes this journey funny and interesting. At the center of the story is ""Skitch"" Patterson, the band's drummer, who is substituted in at the last minute for a gig when the band's regular drummer is injured. His nervousness changes the pace of the band's music, and ultimately, their lives. The film follows Patterson's perspective of the band's experiences and it's interpersonal relationships--like that of Jimmy and Fay. Jimmy is the talented lead-singer whose songwriting gives the band it's boost to success, and Fay is his sweet and soft-spoken girlfriend who is incredibly devoted to his talent and instrumental to the band. The two have been inseparable, but as fame grows, so does Jimmy's ego, much to Fay's dismay. Skitch has his own heartbreaks and successes, which he sees behind his trademark sunglasses, earning him the nickname ""Shades"". Similar in storyline to ""The Committments"", this movie uses good humor, music, and acting to carry you through a solid, fun and, at times, tragic, script. With Tom Hanks acting AND directing, you can't go wrong with this film. It's clean enough for kids, romantic enough for dates, objective enough for diverse groups, interesting enough to own (watch over and over), and easy to follow. I enjoy it immensely."

"DaytonaBob","Null","1","2","4 December 2004"," SPOILER ALERT! A few things I didn't agree with
","First I LOVED this movie and probably have watched it close to two hundred times. No really I have. AND I own the DVD.<br/><br/>The movie is obviously a compendium of bands from the early to mid sixties that came to be known (and are still)as one hit wonders. One Trick Ponies is the other most used description.<br/><br/>From the opening shots and the opening music Hanks did a superb job of making us feel like we had been transported to 1964. My jaw about hit the ground.<br/><br/>The stores, the settings took me back to my days in Ohio not far from Erie PA in the same year. Scary actually.<br/><br/>The band comes together in a very logical way. Just a very good arc from Point A to Point B to Point C. The discovery of the band? Absolutely logical. Small time managers who sell the rights to their band to the upper echelons of music companies who can sell them further upwards as well. Play-Tone is, from the looks of the place, a mid-level to lower-upper level company. Not in the same league as Capitol but just below them.<br/><br/>The bit with the traveling bands was straight out of<br/><br/>""Dick Clark's Cavalcade of Stars"" It was extremely well done and the way it really was. Very few bands could do the arenas and almost none could do stadiums. So State Fairs were the way to go(and still are if you really look around)<br/><br/>Where I started to lose the belief in the storyline was how T.B. Player(I love that)just bugged out on the band. The Marines would have been all over themselves to get into a taping of a show on the level of The Ed Sullivan Show.<br/><br/>Lenny was an actually talented guitar player and I find it difficult to believe he would leave the band in a lurch on recording day. Not believable at all.<br/><br/>In the year they are supposed to be in, the belief that bands had to do STRICTLY other people's stuff wasn't true any longer. The Wonders had shown they were capable of writing great stuff and Mr. White should have seen that and in real life would have. Play-Tone would have wanted to be cutting edge and compromised by allowing several songs they wanted and several songs the band wanted. The material they played on tour was good and Mr. White would have had enough clout to make it work. The band would have then been sent to open for big time bands like The Beach Boys who were on Arena tours at that point. I saw them at Cincinnatti Gardens with 4 opening acts.<br/><br/>THEN after a few more months and maybe the album doing poorly and the band starting to crumble under the weight of touring(which was a major point of breakups back then) I could see Lenny wanting to go someplace with no pressure and Saich wanting to go to the studio and Guy lusting after Faye who was back in Erie, and the Jazz life. THEN it would have made more sense. BUT I understand the shooting schedule and the need to wrap it up.<br/><br/>Just felt the ending didn't work. <br/><br/>Other than that I gave it a TEN."

","Surprisingly fresh and funny directing debut from Hanks.<br/><br/>This is the story about ""the Wonders"", a local band in Erie (PA) who gets a major hit nationwide called ""TTYD"". The movie starts with the band entering a sort of music amateur competition. Since the drummer injures himself they replace him with the jazz-inspired Guy Patterson (Scott) who is so much better. They win this and begin an incredible journey up to the top ten of the chart. I think you see the whole plot now, and what happens. Pretty obvious actually.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks also wrote the movie (and some of the songs!!!), and I wonder where he got the idea. Does he have a musical past? Anyway, he does a wonderful job. The script and the dialogue are fantastic. I really like the way he ends one scene to begin with another. There is always a clever line here, most of them uttered by Steve Zahn. <br/><br/>I don't know if this story is based on a real band but frankly, I don't care. This movie is funny, warm and with a heart, it is very entertaining and it puts you in a good mood. Mostly because of delightful characters, who fits well with the colors of the film and the great setting. And of course, the music is fantastic. Keep in mind that this movie is kind of a /musical. So, even if you aren't that nostalgic you have to somewhat envy those growing up in the sixties, after seeing this movie. <br/><br/>The actors aren't Oscar material, but they are casted very good and they are credible. I think Tom Everett Scott (the smart one) does a very charming performance and of all the movies I have seen; the only performance. Hanks himself plays Mr.White, owner of Playtone Records and manager of the Wonders. Jimmy, played by Jonathan with the last name that I can't even pronounce, is the singer and songwriter (the talented one), and the ""bad guy"" of the band. Liv Tyler is his girlfriend and she is the kind of actress who you really seriously can fall in love with. (Good for her she doesn't look like her father!). Charlize Theron has a small part as Guy's girlfriend. Unfortunately, she rather dates dentists than musicians. Steve Zahn plays Lenny (the funny one). Hank's wife Rita Wilson plays a waitress and I have never seen her this good looking. Also starring Chris Isaac and Kevin Pollack. And Jonathan Demme as the director of a superb musical number with ""Captain Geech and the shrimp shack shooters"".<br/><br/>I would call this a ""Sunday"" kind of a movie. When you are tired after the weekend's escapades and you want to get that ""depression kind of feeling caused by the fact that it is Monday tomorrow"" out of you head. Pick this up at your local blockbuster and enjoy! Grade:  **** out of *****"

I've always wanted to be able to thank Tom Hanks for the movie and the music. They both inspired my then 2 year old son to take up the drums. He's still playing. I loved the music because although it was all original, it sounded like those songs had somehow been part of my life, growing up in the 60's. I like Tom Everett Scott as Guy. Steve Zahn is very funny, and Jonathon Schaech is appropriately moody. There are also some great supporting roles - I love Freddie Frederickson (""Mr. Downtown""), the hotel doorman, the LA DJ and Barry Sobel as Goofball.

","Sure the story of a one-hit wonder rock'n'roll band has been told before, but so what? This movie is fun, fun, fun!<br/><br/>One reviewer commented, upon first release of this movie, that ""if you're going to feature a single song several times in a movie, it better be a damn good one"" (or something along those lines...). 'That Thing You Do' certainly is a catchy song.<br/><br/>Kudos to Tom the director for making his actors learn their instruments and actually BECOME a real band for the movie. That way, the titular song doesn't become repetitive because we get to hear the 'evolution' of the song's arrangement over the course of the story. Starting of course with the simplified garage version all the way to the slick and assured rendition on the television showcase appearance.<br/><br/>Lest we forget, they had other songs in their repertoire as well. Many of them were co-written by Mr. Hanks. Is there no end to this man's talents?<br/><br/>This movie was obviously a labour of love for Tom Hanks, and it shows. I don't think he had any illusions about it becoming a blockbuster or having it significantly add to his income in any way. I think he just wanted to give us a glimpse into what could have been had he taken a slightly different career path in his life. And for that, I for one am grateful."

It's not a blockbuster-kind of movie, it's not an action movie, not a commedy, not a drama. It has a lot of nice tunes, but it's not a musical comedy.<br/><br/>Hanks is not trying to shock the audience, nothing in this movie is forced upon. You will appreciate that all the characters are very credible, as well as the situations and the contexts in which they exits and appear.

","Say what you like about Tom Hanks, but at least he didn't use his clout in Hollywood to write, direct and act in something overwhelmingly pretentious. That's just one of the many points in the film's favour - others include its infectious good nature and its appealing characters (when the title song by the Wonders is played on the radio for the first time you're as excited as the characters are). It doesn't overstay its welcome, and the only problem is that the ending is a bit abrupt. But it's so darn agreeable and fun that it doesn't matter.  As a lifelong Gerry Anderson fan I was thrilled to see a TV screen showing his series ""Fireball XL5,"" I love TV theme songs (and the fictional one for ""Mr. Downtown"" is a cracker), and I seem to have a soft spot for anything with Liv Tyler (so I guess I'd like ""Stealing Beauty"" then).

","It seems that most actors and actresses eventually want to direct movies, but when they do, there's always suspicion that it might be little more than a publicity stunt. Well, I can say that Tom Hanks's directorial debut was very good. Portraying a 1960's rock 'n' roll group's rise to fame, ""That Thing Do You!"" makes one truly nostalgic, even if you didn't live through that era (I was born long after the '60's had ended). Obviously, the band portrayed is loosely based on the Beatles, but that's no crime. It's a very cool movie. Even more interesting is that I now know that it was one of Charlize Theron's early movies: she plays the Guy Patterson's (Tom Everett Scott) first hubby. Within a decade of course, she became the first person from Africa to win an Oscar. Liv Tyler also showed the same flair that she would bring to later movies. All in all, really neat."

This unknown college band have created their own song called ""That Thing You Do!"" and one day they meet Mr. White (Hanks) who works in the music industry, he believes that the band have talent and he wants them to make this song a record and make it number one. Obviously there are moments of despair when the band members complain about stuff to Mr. White, but it ends pretty well.

","I am a bit surprised at all the positive reviews of this movie.  I love Tom Hanks and much of the work he's done, but, this movie disappointed me.  The story is fun and paints what seems like a reasonably accurate picture of the music business, especially in the 60's when one song would get you everything, including dropped like a hot potato when your light flickered.  The problem was in the character development and the flow. Several characters are introduced and given enough camera time to make you think they are going to be vital to the story, then, poof, they are gone from the story.  Some, like the bass player, stay to the last 15 minutes then disappear.  It was easy to see that the drummer and Liv Tyler would end up together, just hard to tolerate how long it took.  The chemistry between the characters was not compelling.  The relationship between the lead singer and Liv was hard to believe. He never seemed to have any interest in her from the beginning.  Lastly, the wrap up prior to the credits is nearly intolerable.  It might be funny in a picture like Animal House to give the follow up bios of the characters, but, in this movie it was a lame catch up on the disappearing acts and hardly believable for some.  If the movie was meant to be light hearted and superficial, it should have stayed light hearted and superficial.  I don't think Mr. Hanks knew exactly what he wanted.. there was either too little drama or too much, too little emotion or too much.  There was no balance and it made the movie feel like it was moving 45mph through a parking lot with speed bumps every 30 feet.  I'd like to see it made by a more experienced Tom Hanks to see if he would change it in any way."

This was a case of the studio bosses thinking Tom Hanks could do no wrong and they dare not annoy him by criticising. It happens so often. Superstar want's to make a picture and the studios allow total freedom, even though they really know it's not working, but it's worth it to keep Tom Hanks happy.

","One very weird thing about the movie before I go on to anything else. What's the deal with the bass player who replaced Chad (Giovanni Ribisi) with the broken arm? He doesn't have a name! It never came up in the picture and he's listed in the movie's end credits as T.B. Player, translated here on IMDb as 'The Bass Player"". I wonder what went into that script writing decision. There was even a scene when the band was getting ready to go into the recording studio and Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) was asking for Jimmy (Johnathon Schaech) and Lenny (Steve Zahn), but not Mr. X. That just baffled me. By the way, it was Ethan Embry in the role with that dubious honor. <br/><br/>Well this looks like a nifty tribute to all those one hit wonder bands throughout the decades who made it with one big Top 40 hit and were virtually never heard from again. So much so that the band's name in the picture is a spin off of the one-hit wonder concept; they called themselves 'the One-Ders', the gimmick being that everyone else read their name as the 'O-neders'. It would have been simple enough to place a hyphen in their name to eliminate the confusion but apparently they needed to keep a running gag in the flick. That got a little overworked in the story until Tom Hanks came on board to change the spelling and make things right.<br/><br/>I'd have to second another reviewer's remarks by stating that it was pretty fresh to see a picture without a lot of swearing and gratuitous sex to appeal to a youthful audience. The actors were a clean cut lot modeled to some extent on The Beatles, which back in 1964 seemed to be the way a lot of the British Invasion bands presented themselves. It was interesting to note that when ""That Thing You Do' made it to Number #71 on the Billboard Top 100, the song immediately above it was 'Tell Me' by the Rolling Stones. So the guys were in pretty good company for a fictitious band. <br/><br/>My favorite characters in the picture oddly enough weren't any of the 'One-Ders'. I liked Liv Tyler in her role as the put upon girlfriend of Jimmy Mattingly; her blistering breakup with Jimmy really changed the tone of the story there for a minute. The guy I really liked was hotel owner and doorman Lamarr, effectively portrayed by Obba Babatundé. Unless I'm mistaken, I don't think I've ever seen him before and thought he played a wonderful character. I'll have to keep my eyes open for another appearance of his.<br/><br/>Over all, not a bad little story that charts the meteoric rise and fall of one of the era's fictional bands. But don't fret, there were plenty of real ones you can pay tribute to - how about The Surfaris (Wipe Out), The Standells (Dirty Water), and The Capitols (Cool Jerk) to name a few. Any one of those is enough to perk your ears up when they come on the radio."

Set in 1964 where a group of young adults form a band and write an overplayed song called ""That Thing You Do."" Tom Hanks becomes their manager and the group becomes the One-ders. Trouble strikes when the band slowly falls apart and they go separate ways. Structure is repetitious but the conclusion bares fact. Directing debut for Hanks who successfully captures the 1960's as well as the struggles of the music industry. He also provides a moral centre in a small but pivotal role as the band's manager. Supporting roles are effective but subdued by predictable writing. Tom Everett Scott seems to be the most durable as he seems to have his heart into it fully. Liv Tyler plays a girlfriend abandoned by another band mate. It is obvious that she will end up with Scott but her closing speech to her ex bares truth. Steve Zahn provides some humour as someone who quits the band to join the military. Superb production gives convincing view of 1960's and the music industry during the period.

But for Tom Hanks (here the filmmaker in addition to actor), he uses Erie as the setting for a boy's band which suddenly rises to fame and go through all of the stereotypical star-making egos where many lessons are learned.<br/><br/>Fans of 60's rock music will love this for its accurate description of the times, through the music, fashions, beehive hairdo's and those crazy home decors usually found in the old Green Stamps catalogs. Erie residents may not recognize State Street in the few street scenes (with the exception of the still standing facade of the old Boston Store), but mentions of Mercyhurst College and radio/TV station WJET (their ABC affiliate-Channel 24 during my youth), plus constant reminders as the boys go on the road that they are Erie natives, the film becomes a hallmark card to a beautiful city that sometimes takes a ribbing but in truth is actually one of the top tourist attractions in Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>Hanks gives an enthusiastic performance as the manager of the band who is determined to rise them to fame. If Detroit can have their Dreamgirls, then Erie is more than allowed to have their Laker Boys! While the real 1960's produced a lot of schlocky rock & roll movies (mainly through some Sam Katzman produced musicals made at Columbia studios or those silly American International Frankie/Annette ""Beach Party"" movies), this is a loving salute to all the glitz from the movies and television shows of this era, with a bit of ""Bye Bye Birdie"" and ""Hairspray"" thrown in.

Film is set in the summer of 1964 and tells of the story of American one hit wonder band, The Wonders. Who after scoring big with their catchy debut single That Thing That You Do, hope to blaze the hits trail like the British Beatles. But with success comes lifestyle changes, and inevitably cracks start to appear in the group dynamic.<br/><br/>Utterly charming in places, and propelled by an irritatingly catchy theme tune, Tom Hanks' directing debut is enjoyable while it's on, if ultimately it's very predictable fare. It lacks bite for the dramatic threads, but the characterisations are strong, the period detail is spot on (Hanks clearly utilising his memory banks) and there's nothing to complain about in the acting. However, the trajectory of the story stays on such a safe formulaic road, with not a snippet of villainy or hardship to be found, that it's hard to genuinely root for this band to succeed. We like them, we like their song, but it's all made so easy for them, while there's also a distinct lack of humour to be found along the way. When the band starts to implode, ask yourself if you really care or not? Safe is the key word, Hanks has played it safe, it's inoffensive stuff and impossible to dislike, and there should be the odd tingle of warmth coursing through your body. But you have to be in a safe sort of mood to forgive it its lack of guts, or at the very least, adventure. 6/10"

","... as a replacement for the word, ""movie""? I mean, do they even USE film anymore? I just think it's pretentious. If film was still around they could almost get away with it, but in the age of video it's DOUBLY pretentious.I really liked the movie itself, but I was 1 when the Beatles broke up, and not into history very much, so I didn't get a lot of the parallels. Even so, and even though all of the bands were fake, the music itself was pretty good. I was surprised at what you could do without genuine bands to do it; if I remember correctly, Tom Hanks wrote or co-wrote all the songs. Kudos to him, and maybe that's a good idea for a second career for him, not that he needs it. I like the movie a lot. It takes you back not only to when music was more innocent, but when America was, I think."

","Everyone in the cast did an excellent job, but really, Tom, you could not have been more insensitive to Ethan Embrey. The poor actor was not even given a name. You wrote this, and you kept referring to him as ""the bass player."" If you want to know who really sparkled in this movie with fantastic facial expressions and personality, it was Ethan. Tom Hanks may be a genius, but thank God he's not a doctor; his bedside manners would be awful. :) Have more compassion next time, Mr. Hanks. Besides, his character was a fun-loving guy who had a passion for being in the Army. It is odd that they mentioned the bass player's name who replaced Ethan in the movie, so what was the point, Tom? Oh, and by the way, I know why you selected the actor you did to portray ""Guy."" He has mannerisms like you and facial expressions too. You trained him well. So, tell us, why mention all the band members' names in the movie, and once... instead of saying Ethan's character's name, you said Faye? I wish you read these comments. You just might learn a thing or two. Anyway, loved the movie. The tunes reminded me of what the Beatles would write. Plus, did you HAVE to have the camera man when the band was live on television focus on ""Wolfman,"" and then you have someone say...""too scary?"" What is that all about? He is no more scary than Mick Jaggar!! But, let's face another fact; Mr. Hanks has always been typecast, so maybe this showed a more ruthless side to one of his many characters. After all, only Tom Hanks is arrogant enough to think he can pull off a movie like ""Castaway."""

","Nostalgic view of 1960s Americana and its early love affair with rock'n'roll as four youngsters (Tom Everett Scott, Ethan Embry, Steve Zahn and Jonathan Schaech) from Pennsylvania become national sensations with their music. Writer/director Tom Hanks steals the show as the group's wise-cracking manager who is not around near enough to sustain interest as the movie grows tiring in its latter stages. Hanks' screenplay is a fluffy feel good time capsule of an era that many not of the age know little about. The band though is hit and miss throughout and the real highlights come from the young ladies (Liv Tyler and Charlize Theron) who follow the group on their meteoric rise to super-stardom. The titled theme song received an Oscar nod in 1996. 4 stars out of 5."

","Boring, uninteresting piece of twaddle.  No reason to sit and watch this thing.  Want to see a better reflection of the times and how things were with a sudden pop band quartet?  Watch ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" which came out in the late seventies about six or seven teens trying to get in to see the Beatles on Ed Sullivan.  You'll get a better feel of things and of more realism than this tired bit of fluff.  Hanks could have wanted to do a movie about paint drying and they would have let him.  No one liked the song, no one knew who the guys were, no one was interested in this band.  No one emerged as a teen heartthrob or went on to other things (Liv Tyler apparently took Bruce willis away from Demi Moore if thats anything).  the band and song was so obscure, everyone kept referring to them as the Oh-need-ers instead of that catchier interpretation, the Wonders, spelled Oneders. This was a miss.  Look for ""I wanna hold your hand"" or better yet, compare the two.  Opposite as night and day and dealing with the same thing."
"Plumpkin","Null","0","1","10 April 2001"," A decent movie, that's it.
","While I agree with the opinion that this movie is a giddy, fun movie with little conflict, I have to say that I find the ending of this movie rather forced.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, we are told that Faye is ""special"" and she is the inspiration for the title song.  However, as the character is written, we get very little about her character other than she is two dimensionally sweet and perky.  The fact that she travels with the band leads me to question her sweet morality; 1960's parents allowed her to travel unescorted with four rock-and-roll musicians?  Hmmm.....<br/><br/>Although I do enjoy this movie, especially the energetic performance of Steve Zahn as Lenny, I am irritated by the end of the movie.  There had been no chemistry between the two characters who end up together at the end of the movie (don't want to spoil it for anyone), no longing looks, no dialogue that hinted at affection.  It seemed like the writer of the movie just contrived this romance in order to have a tidy ""happy ending.""  The ending is the major flaw in an otherwise good movie."

","This film was pure popcorn, neither substance nor taste, just fluff.  The story line was about as timid as a network movie of the week, and the acting was second-rate.  While not a terrible movie, it is only marginally entertaining.  But given Hanks's position as the creative core, I expected more.  A rainy afternoon rental, at best."
