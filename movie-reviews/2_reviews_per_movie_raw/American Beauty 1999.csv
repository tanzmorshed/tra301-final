","Of the 250+ films I've seen and rated on IMDb, only one other (Schindler's List) is as good as American Beauty. A film like this not only entertains while you're in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality. After watching this movie, viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them. The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can't really grasp.<br/><br/>American Beauty reminds us that, like Lester, we really have no idea what we really want. We're not rational creatures as economists assume we are. Our instinct might lead us to perform one action, yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite. We may lust after material belongings, yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them? Lester may lust after Angela, yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality, an entirely different feeling comes over him.<br/><br/>Ricky Fits, the drug-dealing boy next door, is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non-promiscuous, solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind. When many criticize the movie, they say, ""Where's the beauty in a plastic bag?"" And that's the point. We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism. What one person finds attractive, another may find repulsive, yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism. ""It's just a plastic bag! How can there be beauty in it?"" Well, a human being is just an aggregation of tissues, bones, and blood. How is that attractive? It depends on how you look at it. Reality is shaped by perspective.<br/><br/>Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn't actually experience them. But time moves inexorably in one direction. Time cannot be stopped. In a physical sense the past and the future don't exist. We are only conscious in the present. Everything we do, everything we achieve, every bit of happiness we experience -- they are all eventually buried in the past by time. Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty. If you don't believe me, walk into a pre-school and then walk into a nursing home. Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids.<br/><br/>Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line: look closer. An individual's behavior is not independent of his environment. Humans are conformists by nature, and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories. If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned, he is shouted down and ostracized. No one can resist the urge to conform, so why bother? Everyone is nice in public, yet on the streets they blare their horns, scream, and swear. Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a ""chick flick."" They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes. In American Beauty, Angela acts like a total slut, as many girls seem to be nowadays. In the end, however, she is not what she makes herself out to be. Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man, yet in the end it's all just a giant facade. Civilization is but one giant movie, and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization. Otherwise, they're outsiders. Try walking into a job interview without a tie. You'll be thrown out. That is the power of convention.<br/><br/>What if I asked you this question: What do you want in life? Most people would say, ""happiness."" But is happiness worth deluding yourself for? Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive-thinking philosophy, a philosophy of self-affirming mantras and harsh self-discipline. Positive thinking may help you attain your goals, but positive thinking also blinds you from reality. Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie? Self-help is just a euphemism for self-deception. All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life, whether it's religion, money, or even love.<br/><br/>In spite of American Beauty's greatness, there are problems. Characters are stereotypical, but viewers will hardly notice unless they're ultra-critical. Anyway, exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers. Furthermore, Alan Ball's original screenplay is slightly edited. The ending is more optimistic.<br/><br/>Problems aside, Sam Mende's debut movie is one of the greatest I've seen. Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with interesting ideas. It's an important film for society because there's so much society needs to learn. One boy I knew refused to watch American Beauty because, as he said, ""I'm not gonna watch a movie with a name like that!""<br/><br/>Look closer.<br/><br/>10/10"
"RueMorgue","10","529","628","29 May 2000"," An Oscar well deserved.
","This film is one of a kind.  After seeing this film last week, I was left with a hole in the pit of my stomach.  It left many questions in my mind, and most of them cannot be answered. In my view, a film that makes me think after I watch it is second-to-none, and this film certainly delivers in that aspect.<br/><br/>I was amazed with the vivid imagery in this movie, as well as with the symbolism.  However, what makes this film the best of 1999 is the acting. Kevin Spacey shines as Lester Burnham, and Annette Bening (Carolyn Burnham) isn't far behind.  Supporting cast members such as Wes Bentley (Ricky Fitts), Thora Birch (Jane Burnham), Mena Suvari (Angela Hayes), and Chris Cooper (Col. Frank Fitts) only add to the drama of this film.  I think the most special aspect of this film is how all of the characters intertwine in a way that is believable, yet fantastic at the same time.  I congratulate Sam Mendes for his direction of this film, as well as Alan Ball for writing it.  I don't think it could have been any better.<br/><br/>Rated R in the U.S. for strong sexuality, language, drug content, and violence, the film obviously deserves its rating.  However, none of the causes for the R rating are overbearing, and all of them add to the plot-line of this film.  While I don't think that this is a film for children, I would suggest that adults should view it with an open mind.  I believe that the traits which many of the characters in this film have are found in many people around the world. Perhaps that is why this film hits close to home for so many viewers.<br/><br/>While billed by some as a ""comedy-drama"", I don't see anything about this film as funny.  Sure, there are some comedic moments, but by the end, those moments were all but forgotten when faced with the grim reality of the conclusion of the events portrayed in this film.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a light-hearted film with some elements of comedy and some elements of drama, don't see American Beauty.  But if you enjoy films that make you think, and are entertained by an excellent cast, excellent directing, and an excellent screenplay, this film should be at the top of your list.<br/><br/>My Rating:  10/10"
"SD-4","10","425","512","22 March 2000"," A deep, wonderful, penetrating film; extraordinary irony in a psychological drama about the American life.
","I have come to see the movie with a certain prejudice.  Everyone saying that it was so wonderful, so touching, so excited -- I usually tend to go with movies that nobody likes.  Nevertheless, this one was a certain exception.<br/><br/>It is a wonderful psychological drama, a satire about the American community and about the American life; dark, painful irony and cynicism in the descriptions of life and characters; deep sarcasm on types of people in the community, habits of behaviour such as ""...if you want to succeed, you always have to seem successful..."" or ""never stop smiling"", parasites of the community, and, most importantly, the treatment of people who are ""different"", who are ""freaky"" to some extent; and eventually, there is no character in the film that is not odd in its way, although we have to wait for the very ending of the film, to discover this.<br/><br/>With very deep and accurate exaggeration, (most of) the characters in the movie demonstrate the worst, the darkest sides of their personality, while still remaining very human, very touching and very involving the observer. Everyone can find a certain similarity with characters and persons who he met in his life, in the characters described in the film.  The tragi-comical events, the little pieces of funny, disturbing irony dripping from almost every episode, lead the observer to exploration of the American Beauty -- the beauty in life, and the way that we fail to find it, for all our life; the way we hide our feelings and emotions, even behind sullen walls of our sepulchre.<br/><br/>The acting is truly brilliant, the episodes are built logically, coherently, the dialogues are deep, thrilling, intriguing; every sentence and every word is deeply constructed, containing profound irony and intelligent elements of humors.  The plot is very intelligently built, constructing a true indication of the sad situation of the American society, and an excellent ground for the actors.<br/><br/>An amazing movie, strongly recommended.  10/10"
"ryan_lynch","10","515","632","26 February 2000"," A little masterpiece...
","""American Beauty"" is tour de force cinema. Sam Mendes' brilliant debut feature depicts a web of characters who yearn for their own 'American Dream' - yet, in the end, only one character truly attains it.<br/><br/>Having seen ""Happiness"" only recently, I could not help but draw comparisons: both films centre around a microcosm of society in which the people, in their own unique way, all strive to be successful or simply 'happy'. But here the similarities end: the characters in ""Happiness"" undergo a self-realisation process through which they become increasingly aware of their meaningless existence, and go on to wallow in their own depravity. ""Happiness"" shows no signs of redemption; whereas in ""American Beauty"" the audience is offered a sense of hope, of salvation, though the characters must endure a similar fate, or more accurately, they must endure the way of life in which they are trapped.<br/><br/>The pivotal character upon which this theme centres, is the father Lester, played impeccably by Kevin Spacey. He is presented to us as a bit of a loser who plays the subjugated figure in the home and at work. He appears resigned to an unhappy life in which he is treated badly by his wife and daughter and his boss at work. Seemingly beyond redemption, Lester transforms from being a loser.<br/><br/>Mendes portrays this transformation admirably well: he shows Lester on his 'path to enlightenment' pushed up against a grim background of suburbanite existence. These early scenes are well balanced, forming a steady rhythm of TV commercial-like vignettes which prove very comical, if at times unsettling. As Lester reflects in the film: ""My life is like a commercial"". And how this rings true: like in ""Happiness"", all the characters hide underneath this veneer of normality and respectability, yet they are all revealed to be nothing but the opposite: depressed, depraved and desperate.<br/><br/>Lester's wife, played by Annette Benning, is the most success-driven character in the story which renders her the most hopeless in the film's tone of moral conviction. ""In order to be successful in life one must project the appearance of success"" is the maxim she adopts from the 'king' of real estate, Buddy King. It is a phrase which resonates throughout the film: for Benning's pawn, life is all about keeping-up appearances. This is where Lester differs from her: his emancipation is enabled by him discarding the constraints of 'normal life' and following what his heart desires.<br/><br/>Lester is the catalyst in this narrative in which the ancillary characters either follow suit (as does his daughter and Ricky) or pay the price (as does his wife and the Colonel). The irony inherent in this film, and it grows with resonance as the film draws to a conclusion, is that the only character who truly becomes free must sacrifice everything in order to achieve it. Yet it is through his sacrifice that he is able to afford the surviving characters a glimpse of hope in life.<br/><br/>This film left me gasping for air: its hyper-realism conveys, at the same time, a portrait of the suburban comedy, a jolting-shock of realisation, and a cathartic sense of hope. Mendes depicts a certain people who, to varying degrees, all strive for a certain 'American Dream', yet so few actually attain it. Though whilst one may have difficulty with tagging this film with the 'feel good' label, the beauty of ""American Beauty"" is that it sits half-way between a desperate cry for help and a reassuring sense of happiness and fulfilment and that is cinema at its best."
"Antithesys","10","699","867","9 September 2000"," Beautiful...so beautiful
","American Beauty is the greatest movie ever made.<br/><br/>If you haven't already, watch American Beauty by yourself and give yourself some time afterwards to think it over. You will never, ever look at life the same way. It does exactly what movies are meant to do - give us a window into ourselves, and American Beauty does that better than any other film has ever done. No word of dialogue is unnecessary, no character exaggerated, everything is perfect...but if you have seen American Beauty you should know that already. Once you look closer at this movie, and see Beauty in every frame, it becomes so much easier to look closer and see Beauty in everything around you. You think I'm waxing poetic? Then you must not have seen the movie. Every character is a part of each of us: the Lester Burnham of change, the Carolyn of uncertainty and failure, the rebellion of Jane, the defeated Barbara, the false control of Angela and the Colonel, and the real control of Ricky. To me Ricky, not Lester, is the center of this story; he somehow controls or sets in motion the heart of Lester's rebirth and downfall. There are several parts of this movie where I lose control every time I see it, and none more so than the paper bag scene. To me that scene is simply the greatest monologue ever written.<br/><br/>I listened to the message of American Beauty - look closely and you can find Beauty in anything - and it changed my life. I rose out of a long, deep depression and started out into the world. Sometimes there is so much Beauty in the world, I can't even stand it, and it feels like my heart is going to burst.<br/><br/>This is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen."
"Philip_Pugh","10","369","469","29 November 2003"," Beautiful...
","Probably the best film of 1999. This dark comedy drama marks two fantastic feature film debuts with Alan Ball as writer and Sam Mendes as director (both winning oscars for their sterling efforts).<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a man on the brink of a mid-life crisis, who suddenly becomes obsessed with one of his teenage daughters friends played by Mena Suvari. His daughter (Thora Birch) is, as Lester tells us; ""a typical teenager. Angry, insecure, confused..."". And his wife Caroline (Annette Bening) has an obsession of her own, her public appearance.<br/><br/>Life starts off on a downer for the Burnhams and their new neighbours the Fitts despite their lives looking good from the outside.<br/><br/>As life begins to improve (with most of the main characters finding what they think is love or new relationships) it soon all comes crashing down in the climactic final day.<br/><br/>The writing is nothing short of brilliant and made even more amazing by knowing that it comes from a first time feature film screen writer Alan Ball (who had had years of prior experience writing TV sitcoms -  not  that you'd be able to guess from the tone of this film).<br/><br/>The directing is on a par with the writing and Sam Mendes manages to get some brilliant performances from the great cast, who are all faultless. No doubt Mendes' theatre directing past played a huge part in directing the actors so well.<br/><br/>Another person worthy of a mention is the late director of photography Conrad L. Hall, another one of the five oscar recipients for this film.<br/><br/>All the elements in this film gel perfectly together to make one superb masterpiece. Not one person, either cast or crew, steals this film or does anymore than anyone else to make this film what it is. Truly an ensemble effort. 10/10."
"reesew18","10","161","201","7 July 2001"," a very well done film that continues to amaze me...
","When I first saw this movie in theaters, I found it to be very funny. When I rented it at home, I found it to be very sad and complex. Looking at it now, I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood. To some it may look trite or cliched, or maybe too un-ordinary to be worthy of its praise, but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful. After you've seen it, you know you've seen something.<br/><br/>A few notable elements stand out. The direction is superb; this is visually a superior film, for the director understands the subtle changes in tone. The writing is equally compelling; the story effortlessly interweaves multiple stories to create one amazing movie. The haunting music is also notable. Lastly is the acting. Kevin Spacey has done excellent films before, and he can add this one to the list. He may be a little to witty to suggest the overshadowed character he portrays, but he simply disappears into the role. Annette Bening is also fine; a less strong role, but she is magnificent none the less. As the teenagers, Thora Birch is able to mesmerize us with one intense look; her ""typical teenager"" role is fleshed out completely. I enjoyed Mena Suvari's character equally. It seemed that she did not receive as much acclaim, but her performance evokes both innocence and experience, and her scenes toward the end give her a depth unlike any other character. And Wes Bentley, as the video-taping boy next door, is easily the most original character. At first he seems a little tense, but, like Spacey, he sinks into the role. His ""purpose"" in the film, unlike anyone else's, is a mystery, thus making him the most enigmatic person.<br/><br/>Most films are able to make a lasting impression on its audience, but never has a movie been known to ""move"" its viewers as much as this movie. It truly says something about life, no matter how predictable or tacky it appears, this film disturbingly shows us how to appreciate our individual lives, so therefore, when they are over, we each have something to remember."
"The Woof","10","242","319","5 November 1999"," One of my faves of the year...simply great.
","This movie was a joy to watch.  I didn't know what to expect when I came into it.  I had heard the buzz of the acting and the story, etc...but we've all heard that before and had been disappointed, but not so with this one.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey plays this part to a ""T"".  He is strong when it requires and meek when it is needed.  His emotional rollercoaster ride is a trip to partake in. Annette Bening is marvelous as well.  I think they both should be nominated.<br/><br/>The support cast is also spectacular.  Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari all give great performances as the troubled ""Teenagers"" in the film. Of particular mention is Wes Bentley's performance, worthy of a supporting nomination as well.<br/><br/>This is a dramatic and funny tale of a man and his life in a state of turmoil and transition.  When he happens to see a beautiful friend of his daughter's at a cheerleading exhibition, he is completely infatuated with her beauty.  Using this as his inspiration, he attempts to change all aspects of his life.  He confronts his marriage, his job, his ego, and his libido.<br/><br/>The music in this film is also very well chosen.  There are moments when the music fits so perfectly with the scene that they meld together as one to present a perfect emotion.<br/><br/>The plot can get rather involved, but you will follow it endlessly to see where you go.  I was simply involved, hook, line and sinker.<br/><br/>See this movie more than once, and skip some of the other movies out now that are dare I say, trash.<br/><br/>This should be on the top of many critic's lists this year and it is certainly on top of mine.<br/><br/>My Rating (1 - 10):  10"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","165","218","14 August 2001"," An American Masterpiece
","This is by far one of the best, if not THE, movies of the 90's. ""American Beauty"" stole my vote immediately as I started watching it. The idea and concept of ""American Beauty"" is just some ordinary people on an ordinary block with ordinary lives.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnam, a middle aged married man who has lost some hope in life. He has a job that is degrading, a wife who refuses to show any type of loving emotion towards him, a daughter who practically hates herself, and is judged constantly as a looser. But all of a sudden, he sees his daughter's friend, Angela, and something snaps in him to do something with his life. He quits his job and takes, the dreaded by most Americans, a fast food cook job. He starts working out and doing some illegal substances. Even though this sounds like he is ruining his life, it actually helps him and makes him realize how much he loves ""the precious moments in his stupid little life."" You have no idea what he is talking about I'm sure, but don't worry, you will some day. Kevin Spacey was by far the best actor in 1999 and deserved this Oscar 100%.<br/><br/>Annete Benning plays Carol Burnam, Lester's wife. She is a very fake and unsuccessful real estate agent who cannot get a sale. Her image in life is ""in order to be successful, one most project an image of success at all times"". You can tell, she is not happy with her marriage and starts to have an affair with the big boss of the real estate company. Again, seems horrible, but it helps her in the end. Annete was unfortunately robbed of an Oscar for this film.<br/><br/>The supporting cast: Thora Birtch who plays Janie, Lester and Carol's daughter, is extremely depressed and hates her body and herself. But when she notices a strange boy next door and develops a relationship with him, she realizes how precious life is and starts communicating with her family. Mena Suvari plays Angela, Janie's best friend, Lester's crush, and a girl who is clearly insecure despite her attempts at showing her sexy side to every guy in town. Wes Bentley plays Ricky, the next door neighbor boy who looks at something as simple as a bag being tossed in the wind as something beautiful. Some say that this was a very stupid scene, but I disagree. His dialog was perfect and made us look twice at something so simple. He won most of our hearts despite having somewhat of an arrogant attitude. Wes without a doubt got robbed of a nomination for this movie. Chris Cooper plays Ricky's father, Col. Frank Fits. He is a military Sergent who is very abusive to his wife and son and is an obvious homophobic that turns into an ironic situation in the end. Chris also should've been nominated.<br/><br/>The most stunning character actually to me was Allison Janney who played Barbara Fits, Ricky's mom, and Frank's wife. She was so beautiful and perfect. Her scene in the front room with Frank and Ricky, everything is so quite, and she says ""I'm sorry, what?"". Ricky says ""Mom, no one said anything"". When Ricky gets kicked out by Frank after a horrible accusation, Ricky says ""Mom, I'm leaving"". Instead of being like the average mom and trying to stop him or say things will get better, she knows this is best and says ""OK. Wear a raincoat"". Allison was just amazing and didn't get enough credit for her role.<br/><br/>If there could have been nominations for every role in this movie, they were well deserved. This is a terrific movie that should be watched by every adult. It'll make you look again at your life and think. What a great movie.<br/><br/>10/10"
"uhmartinez-phd","10","175","232","12 November 2007"," Close To Perfection
","The intention is so clear that everything else falls into place, perfectly. Kevin Spacey's suburban husband and father reminded me of his character in ""The Ref"" and that could only be a good thing. Annette Bening and her giggle works wonders here. Their marriage is a tabloid version of a ""Who's Afraid To Virginia Woolf"" Which means very close to someone we know. The biggest surprises in the film. besides the amazing dexterity of Sam Mendes at his first outing behind the camera, are West Bentley. Chris Cooper, Thora Brch and Allison Janney. As I'm writing this 8 years after its first release, the Oscars and the whole hullabaloo, I'm very surprised that West Bentley hasn't become a major star. He is amazing in ""American Beauty"" the complexities of his character are based on recognizable human stands, the hardest to face up to and I went where he went. Thora Birch is lovely as the object of his attention and the film, I believe, is here to say."
"Rusty-61","Null","163","217","16 September 1999"," Could be the best movie of the year.
","And there were a lot of great ones this year. I will also say something even (possibly) bolder--that Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his career. And all us movie geeks know that is saying a LOT, given this man's past roles, and his talent. I used to think he was overrated as an actor. Then I figured OK, I see what all the fuss is about. Now, he's up there with my favorite actors of all time, with James Woods, Steve Buscemi, Robert Deniro...probably in the top 5. <br/><br/>I was lucky enough to see a free screening this afternoon and boy, am I glad I had the privilege. In fact, this review might not even be that coherent- it's one of those movies that blows you away so much that you have trouble even putting your feelings into words. <br/><br/>The plotline sounds trite when you first describe it (it did to me when I first heard about it), Spacey plays a man who describes himself as a loser, with Annette Bening as his horrible, shrewish, self-absorbed, pathetic b*tch of a wife. His daughter is not all that likeable either, despite the fact that you can understand why she turned out this way, with her as a mother. Just when you think you've met the most dysfunctional family in the world outside of ""Happiness"", you find out about the family who just moved in next door. At first, the strange son seems like the most messed-up member of their brood, but after you get to meet his ex-military, abusive, homophobic, terrifying father and his withdrawn, sad, headcase mother, you realize he is the most normal member of the household by far. Then, the filmwriters toss in Kevin Spacey's lustful obsession with his daughter's sexkitten cheerleader friend, which trust me, is a lot more fun, entertaining, and amusing than it sounds when you read about it. Soon, he is having the most entertaining, amusing midlife crisis ever seen in the history of cinema. He just doesn't give a ***k about what he does or says anymore, and you only wish you could get away with doing the things he does.<br/><br/>I found myself laughing out loud in this movie so many times, most of it horrified, amazed laughter at what is happening and the things that are coming out of the character's mouths, especially Spacey's. He had at least a dozen lines that had every member of the audience in hysterics and actual applause and cheers. <br/><br/>I can't say enough good things about this movie. You think, after the first five minutes, that you know how the movie will end. Well, Spacey's opening narrative does give it away, but trust me, the events unfold in a way that you will NEVER see coming. You will swear you can see what a character is going to do next, what violent or self-destructice act they will commit, but you turn out to be wrong.<br/><br/>Without getting too pretentious here, the movie lives up to it's theme/tagline of ""...look closer"". THe characters are not what they seem, up until the end, and even then they surprise you. At least two characters that you are POSITIVE you have figured out, do or say something that turns all your preconceptions of them upside down, while making your jaw drop, and your heart ache. You will leave the movie with a smile, though, and that is maybe what I expected least of all.<br/><br/>Words just cannot do this movie justice. <br/><br/>See it for yourself."

","What can I say, except that this film really knocked me on my keaster.  I went in to the theater not knowing what to expect, but was pretty sure it would be worth the ticket price.  Boy was I happy when I left.  Not only was it worth the ticket, I paid to see this film two more times.  This film is virtually perfect.  The acting is superb, the story is magnificent, the narrative is brilliant, and the structure of the film is truly groundbreaking (absolutely loved the last 20 minutes).  What really surprised me about this film was how well the cinematography was done.  In a small, character driven film such as this, it is very unusual to have such great cinematography.  With this film, there is something interesting going on in every scene, not many films you can say that about.  In a year where first time directors have made some of the best films, Three Kings, Being John Malkovich, etc...  Sam Mendes seems to have out-done them all.  Though I have yet to see The Green Mile or Magnolia, I find it hard to believe that either film will out-shine American Beauty.  This film should easily win a substantial amount of the Oscars this year.  What's up with all the cirtics awards snubbing it so far?"
"Michael Carruthers","Null","145","216","6 April 2001"," Look closer at this dazzling, powerful masterpiece of a drama.
","On a scale of 0 to 100; I gave American Beauty a score of 99.<br/><br/>Wowno, I mean that. American Beauty is a film that takes my breath away each time I watch it, and every time I do watch it, I notice something newer, something more exciting and something more funny. There is honestly no other movie like this, and if you haven't seen it, there is something donged in your head, and you must do so now.<br/><br/>Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is in a mid-life crisis, caused by his stressed wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and rebelling teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch). When Lester and Carolyn go watch Jane cheerleading, they meet Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), and Lester, caught in sudden lust for Angela, decides to change his life. Angela and Jane's friendship is not all it seems, too, because Angela only brags about how many times she's done it with guys and stuff. That doesn't help an already insecure Jane very much but she finds solace in the arms of the next-door-neighbours' son, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley). Ricky, himself from a broken home as well, and Jane find they have a lot in common and eventually turn out to be soulmates.<br/><br/>Everything about this film is so darkly clear, it is extremely obvious why the Academy loved it, and it is very obvious to see that I love it. Spacey brings Lester wildly to life in a performance reminiscent of Spacey's acting coach Jack Lemmon. Also on top form is Annette Bening, in an over-controlled performance that is just so instantly loveable. While all the attention went to these performers, it is also Thora Birch (especially), Mena Suvari, Wes Bentley and a quiet Allison Janney that manage to steal the show just as much. Sam Mendes is an excellent director, this is his first feature, and he is a British man directing an American-based film! And he won an Oscar for it! That's an amazing achievement, ditto to Alan Ball, who's script is effectively a stunner and an instant winner.<br/><br/>The best film of 1999, the best film of its decade and for now anyways, American Beauty stands tall as the best film ever made."

","The first time I heard about this movie I thought it was this movie and about a man with cancer and then read a lot of good things about and then say some trailers and then I saw it. At first I did not like this movie but than say it again on T.V and then loved it ever since. This is one of the most original films I have ever seen. The performances are one of the best and more Oscars should have been handed out. The directing by Sam Mendes is superb and I'm glad that he won the Oscar. Alan Ball wrote one of the best screenplay and story's ever thought and there's a reason why he won the Oscar and most deserving. This is the Best of the 1990's and that decade had a lot of great movies came out( Goodfellas, L.A Confedintil, Pulp Fiction to name a few). This was the first movie that I saw that was perfect and I had to see it over and over so I can just uncover everything that was in this movie. This movie is in my top ten movies of all time and I'm glad that it's rank number 35 and that one of the reason why I joined this because it was the only website people respect my opinions and agreed with me. Keven Spacey gives his best performance and one of the best of time. Spacey brings a great performance for a really deep and is just a great character. Annette Bening does a great and for some reason missed the Oscar. Chris Copper does a great job and didn't get notice that much, also did Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari and thora Birch did a great job and should have more notice. Sam Mendes does a great directing job and is one the best film debut ever. This film was one the best ever made and should be seen by everyone hows looking for great movie or how just want have fun watching a movie."
"Jason Morales","Null","59","100","4 March 2000"," LOOK CLOSER at this BEAUTiful AMERICAN film.
","Sam Mendes' big screen directorial debut will one day be mentioned along with classic greats like Psycho, Vertigo, 2001 and Sunset Blvd., which it cleverly mimics in a certain way. That way, I won't ruin it, if like me, you stayed away from all reviews and talk about American Beauty until you actually saw the movie. To my surprise, I somewhat succeeded. The script, wonderfully written by Alan Ball, who like Mendes is doing his first try in this certain ball park, and hitting a home run. Sorry for the cheesy analogy, but I may talk like that through out this review because this is the kind of movie where words can do no justice and it's almost impossible to translate your feelings into words. A similar experience happened to me earlier this year with Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. But back to American Beauty.<br/><br/>""When You've Got Nothing To Lose, You Might As Well Risk Everything.""~Tagline for this film.<br/><br/>That is probably one of the most accurate taglines I've ever read in my life. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey, in what may be the best role of his career, which used to be Swimming With Sharks) is reaching his mid-fourties. Uh-oh, mid-life crisis time, he rarely ever talks to his daughter (Thora Birch) whose feelings for him, border on hate. He and his wife Carolyn, (Annette Benning, being able to make me forget about In Dreams) constantly bicker and the whole Burnham family quietly sit at the dinner table except for the occasional quibble about this or that, for instance (""Mom, why do we have to listen to this elevator music?"") The new next door neighbors, the Fitts, move in one day. Colonel Fitts (Chris Cooper, giving one of the finest supporting character performances this year), is a hard-core Army officer. (Every six months, he makes his son Ricky take a urine test to make sure he's not on drugs.) His idea of fun is sitting in front of the t.v. at night with his wife (Allison Janney) watching shows of Army Cadets training. Ricky Fitts is a hopeless optimistic. He is what Dawson (from the Creek) wishes he could be. Ricky walks around everywhere with his hand held camcorder (while selling dope of the side) filming all the beauty in the world. (""Sometimes, there's so much beauty in the world that it overwhelms me and my heart feels like it's going to cave in). He finds a new subject to add to his beauty collection of film. Lester's daughter, Janey. At first she doesn't like his new interest in her and thinks he's weird, but as the film progresses, they get to know each other and she starts to understand Ricky, and instead of thinking he's weird, thinking he's special. Special in being able to find beauty in the most minor and trivial things you can think of. (""Would you like to see the most beautiful thing I've ever filmed?"" That turns out to be a 15 minute shot of a plastic bag flying in the wind, right before it snows.) One night, Carolyn, in an effort to help Lester save his relationship with Janey, (although, it could be her trying to save her own relationship with her daughter) makes Lester go with her to a basketball game at Janey's high school, where she cheerleads. Lester meets Janey's best friend Angela (Mena Suvari, in an interesting turn from Choir Girl in American Pie). Angela sets something off inside Lester and wakes him up from his 20 year sleep and makes him start changing and living life to the fullest. (""I feel like I've been in a coma for the past 20 years and am just beginning to wake up). Although this is work of an ensemble cast, this is really Spacey's forum. The acting throughout this film is remarkable. Newcomer Wes Bently was excellent as the outcast Ricky, who came off as shy, yet confident. The cinematography in this film is majestically beautiful, in every frame, it's almost as if you're invited right into the scene. For instance, in one scene when Spacey came home from a cocktail party with Benning, he was in the refrigerator getting a root beer and out popped Suvari, I was so entranced into that scene, that I actually felt Spacey's startle when he saw her. This movie could be categorized as a drama, although throughout the movie, I had a smile on my face. I got to know these characters, almost as if, as friends. In a gossipy kind of way, I couldn't wait to see what happened next because this film was a look behind the scenes of real suburban life. These people portrayed, really do exist in the world. Somewhat like the people in Happiness, the people and what they do are just like things families you know do, or even your family does. The last scene of this film is amazing. Although it starts too early, way before it's ready to, it pays off at the end. With tensions building, and emotions rising, the inevitable climax will leave you breathless while making you wish it wouldn't happen and that somehow it would change. There is so much more to say about this movie, and so much left out, but I can't help it. Sam Mendes' American Beauty is an instant masterpiece, as Lester says in the movie, ""You have no idea what i'm talking about, I'm sure. But don't worry..... You will someday."" I believe those are words to live by for explaining the brilliance of this film even though critics and audiences love it now, it won't truly be appreciated until after it's time."
"WiseFool","10","37","62","2 November 1999"," The Beautiful Truth
","This is a profound movie that examines ordinary people.  For all their flaws people are basically beautiful and that is one of the many threads of the fabric of this film.  I liked that it was revealed at the start of the film that Lester would soon meet his demise.  And I also liked at the ending, the identity of the person who took his life didn't really matter, just the sadness of the loss of his life.  'Look Closer' was the theme of this movie and Lester even had this motto in his cubical.  Kevin assumed the persona of Lester with a range of acting that is quite worthy of awards.  Bening inhabited Carolyn in much the same way.  Which one of us hasn't experienced the disillusionment of our teenage years, only to later re-experienced it again through our children.  And like Carolyn, who among us has not been intensely disappointed with ourself at some point?  That one scene was amazing, it looked so real that it transcended acting.  And can a movie actually move beyond entertainment by causing more than absorbing discussion, but real change in it's audience?  Perhaps.  But if this is true, then that movie would be American Beauty.  And for those who feel this movie doesn't achieve this lofty accolade.  To them I say, ""Never underestimate the power of denial.""  A ten, of course."
"andrew7","6","48","90","5 February 2002"," The closer I look, the worse it gets
","I first saw this in theaters back in 1999.  I loved it.  I really really loved it.  I've seen it four or five times since, and each time, I like it less.  I just saw it again a couple of days ago, and I stopped it before it was over.  At that moment, I decided to sell my DVD.  It has now been excised from my DVD Collection, about which I have considerable pride.<br/><br/>The main reason is that I have come to feel very strongly that this film doesn't know what it wants to say.  It takes a bunch of characters, constructs various relationships between them, and sets them loose to run around for two hours, at the end of which, what have we learned?<br/><br/>
I've heard lots of people make comparisons between this film and another highly acclaimed movie of 1999 which I hate:  Fight Club.  Both films include philosophically flimsy but highly entertaining critiques of materialism.  With Fight Club, the critique on materialism is made by the character who turns out to be the villain of the piece, who seeks to replace it with fascism.  In American Beauty, the anti-consumerist is, first of all, a total hypocrite, and second of all, has a life changing epiphany the moment before his death, but never gets a chance to expound upon what that epiphany was.<br/><br/>On the hypocrisy charge, consider the oft-quoted scene when Lester Burnham (magnificently portrayed by Kevin Spacey) yells at his wife Carolyn (played in an over-the-top caricature by Annette Bening) for placing too high a value on material things, in this case, a sofa.  Fine.  He makes a good point.  No one else seems to have noticed, however, that this is precisely the same scene where it is revealed that Lester has bought a 1970 Pontiac Firebird.  Since we at no time see Lester enjoying the use of his car, the implication is that possession of the object is a good in itself, which is the very apex of materialism.<br/><br/>There are lots of other things that we don't see, and I never noticed until I ""looked closer"" how conspicuous they are in their absence.  We never see Angela or Jane don a cheerleading uniform after their initial cheerleading scene.  They never make any reference to being cheerleaders.  The whole concept of cheerleading, then, is merely a mechanism (and quite a contrived, not to mention cliched mechanism at that) to introduce Lester to Angela.<br/><br/>
I also noticed, when I looked closer, how painfully bad much of the dialogue given to the younger characters is.  ""Lame-o""  ""Geekboy""  ""Take a whizz"" It's just horrid.  And why, exactly, was Jane looking at a breast augmentation website?  First of all, her breasts don't appear to need augmenting (when I saw this in theaters, I thought she must want to reduce her breasts, but upon looking closer, the computer monitor clearly says ""augmentation"", which means a process of adding to).<br/><br/>The worst flaw of the film, by far, is the fact that we have one horrible cliche repeated twice in the space of minutes in the final act.  The homophobic marine turns out to be a repressed homosexual, and the slutty cheerleader turns out to be a virgin.  For the love of God, who let those two howlers slip through.  Bad enough that either made the final cut, but both?!!  It defies understanding.<br/><br/>The scene that made me turn the film off, this final time that I watched it, was the scene were Jane and Ricky decide to run off together.  I was never very comfortable with this scene, because, call me conservative, I'm just not thrilled about a girl dropping out of school at the tender age of seventeen (or so) and running off with her drug dealer boyfriend.  But what really got my goat was when Ricky ridiculed Angela by calling her ordinary. Fair enough, Angela had it coming.  But for Ricky to not only accept Angela's principle that ordinariness is bad, but to use it against her... that bothered me.  Ordinariness or lack thereof is not a valid criterion for judging the worth of a human being.  Ricky, having been set up (clumsily) as a heroic character, shouldn't have descended to such a twisted and hateful principle.<br/><br/>The whole film has the feel of having been made up as it went along.  It is radically different from how it was originally planned to go.  The prelude sequence and the scene later in the film which it foreshadowed have become utterly pointless since the removal of the subplot about Jane and Ricky being blamed for Lester's murder.  Now, that subplot is a bit ridiculous, and was cut for a good reason, I agree.  But why leave the set up if you're cutting the payoff?  [Notice that Ricky shuts off the camera before Jane says ""You know I'm joking, right?""]<br/><br/>The sequence where Col. Fitts spies on Ricky and Lester is straight out of ""Three's Company.""  Fitts sees just enough to draw the conclusion that the writer wants him to draw, and nothing else.  That's a classic example (and the most blatant I can recall from any film) of bad, contrived plotting. What exactly was up with Mrs. Fitts?  Presumably, her scenes meant something in some previous, unreleased version of the story.  The initial meeting between Lester and Ricky is built on numerous coincidences... Ricky just happens to be working there, and he works there just long enough to meet Lester!!!  And what self-respecting drug dealer would give a man $2,000 worth of merchandise on the assumption that he'd be willing/able to pay for it later?  It would have been more contrived if Lester happened to have $2,000 in cash while jogging, but ""I know you're good for it"" isn't much better.<br/><br/>This film is ambitious.  There are lots of individual pieces of greatness in it.  There are a lot of really good ideas.  But on a fundamental level, it just doesn't work."

","This piece of sitcommy, cliche-ridden claptrap is just smart enough on its surface for the middlebrow Academy to pimp it for a Best Picture Oscar. But anyone with half a brain will see through this tired male fantasy pretty soon. Mendes shows us a Edward Scissorhands-type of suburbia: perfect lawns, identical homes, etc... We are expected to know (since we've seen ES, Ice Storm, Happiness, Serial Mom, etc.) that these people must lead shallow, empty lives - look where they live! And... they do! This is just the first of many obvious themes that we have seen so many times before. And we haven't even reached Spacey's character's midlife crisis yet. (Surprise! He falls in sexual lust with a gorgeous high-school blonde. Sooooo subversive! Look closer, and you'll find even more cliches.) Spacey's wife is, predictably, a self-centered shrew who won't satisfy him sexually but cooks delicious nutritious dinners and sells (surprise) real estate. His daughter is a misfit (wow!) with whom he can't connect. The new kid on the block (of course there is one) is a weird, sensitive (but handsome) loner type (shocker) who (believe it or not) falls for Spacey's moody daughter. Don;t even ask about the gay neighbors. Mendes does nothing but condescend to his characters, his setting, and above all, the audience. Positives: Thora Birch is terrific and lovely; Mena Suvari is breathtakingly beautiful, and the plastic bag sequence is affecting. Pretentious c***."
"Brundledan","1","134","281","3 April 2000"," Everything that's wrong with Hollywood, distilled into two horrible hours. Spoilers.
","Now, let me see if I've gotten this straight: ""Saving Private Ryan"", an epic tale of honor, glory, and sacrifice set against the backdrop of what was possibly the most important single day of the Twentieth Century, was not worthy of the Best Picture Oscar.<br/><br/>However, ""American Beauty"", a movie whose heroes are a middle-aged pedophile who casually endangers the future of his family, and the next-door drug dealer who finds ""beauty"" in people getting their brains blown out, is.<br/><br/>I see.<br/><br/>""American Beauty"" might work as satire if 1.) it weren't telling us something we've KNOWN for fifty years - that the suburbs are not this perfect, ""Ozzie and Harriet"" world of smiling, white-bread people - and 2.) if the characters depicted in the movie were in any way REALISTIC. Instead, ""American Beauty"" is a parade of the most tiresome Hollywood cliches of the 1990s. I don't care how pathetic Spacey's and Bening's characters' lives are - would they really be THAT devoid of any redeeming values? Are we supposed to CHEER Spacey as he quits his job, smokes pot, and lusts after seventeen year-old girls, all to the detriment of his young daughter? Are we supposed to laugh at the ex-Marine's idea that the world NEEDS certain rules and standards in order to work? Clearly, we are. These are not characters at all, but ciphers. Indeed, the ex-Marine is one of the most laughable ciphers at all. He is the parody of the Evil Gun-Toting Gay-Bashing Right-Wing Military Nut, taken to its furthest extreme. As columnist John Leo recently put it, ""the only thing they forgot to do was to make him a tobacco company chemist and a trustee of a segregated college."" And the final revelation that the ""gay-basher"" is in fact gay himself is the final piece of this Hollywood stereotype; a move meant purely to make sure this character and his world-view, that of the importance of morality and of the necessity of rules in society, is completely discredited.<br/><br/>And I know, I know: I'm not reading between the lines. I need to ""look closer"". Well, I submit that those who glowingly praise this movie are looking TOO closely. It's easier to lose sight of the larger message a movie sends when you examine any one element too closely. And all that the people who made this movie have ""proved"" is that they live on an entirely different planet from the hard-working, Joe and Jane America they claim to so brilliantly ""expose"" - the same Joe and Jane America that keeps Hollywood in business.<br/><br/>(Ordinarily, I'd rate a movie like ""American Beauty"" about a ""3"". But since it was without question both the most offensive AND the most overrated movie of 1999 (move over, ""The Phantom Menace""), and since more needs to be done to counterbalance these morons who think it's the next ""Citizen Kane"", I feel I have no choice but to go with my original gut instinct and give it a big fat ""1"". For years, I've made it a practice to save every ticket stub from every movie I've seen, regardless of its quality. Nevertheless, my ""American Beauty"" ticket stub now sits in torn-up shreds at the bottom of the concession-area garbage can. It seemed a fitting gesture toward this Oscar-winning piece of putrescent pap.)"
"Oro-Indiano","1","171","366","24 February 2000"," The greatest trick Kevin Spacey ever pulled...
","Kevin Spacey is a genius, or at least a veritable magician.  A couple of the folks with whom I saw ""American Beauty"" said afterwards: ""It was great - Spacey was incredible.""  His performance, it seems, is enough to have convinced people that they had just watched a decent movie, even though there is little else to recommend the film.  The other significant plus is the advertising campaign - marketing it as ""a funny drama"" and ""a moving comedy"" is an ingenious way of disguising the fact that it is neither. Since there are only two or three really good laughs in the piece it isn't really funny enough to be a comedy (but since it's written by someone who used to work on ""Cybill"", that's hardly a surprise) and since it only gets vaguely dramatic towards the end, it doesn't maintain the atmosphere of a ""drama"".  But the audience happily accepts this schizophrenic mess because the adverts told them to.  The adverts also told them to ""Look closer"". Again, this is a tip-top marketing ploy, since it implies hidden depth, significance and meaning, without the content actually being there.  The average audience member is going to think ""Wow, that plastic bag blowing around must be really poignant, because this is a DEEP movie.""  Heaven forbid that they should actually think for themselves.  Look closer, indeed.<br/><br/>What then, of the characters?  Well, what characters?  Every one on display here is little more than a stereotype, from  fortysomething midlife crisis guy, to the uptight career-driven wife, to their moody teenage daughter to the moody teenage boy, to the homophobic soldier who - gasp - turns out to be gay, etc etc etc.  Take the gay couple across the street, for example. They are only around for two or three scenes, and only then to provoke some more bigotry from Lieutenant Colonel Asskicker.  They might as well have been two cardboard cut outs labelled ""Gay"" for all that they were able to develop.  I know they are only supporting characters, but if you're going to do a movie which tackles the issue of homosexuality, you could at least have some believable homosexual characters in it, rather than 2-D cliches.<br/><br/>This is indicative of the whole, ghastly, contrived nature of this film. Characters don't feel like characters because they don't behave in an even remotely plausible manner, they don't behave consistently, and they seem to stumble through from one set-piece to the next.  For example, Spacey getting a job at Happy Burgers; sure, that's amusing, but the whole thing is engineered just so he can catch his wife out, and then it's dropped.  It doesn't fit in with any discernible character arc, but is simply contrived to get a cheap laugh.  What about Ricky Fitts at the beginning?  You've just moved into a new neighbourhood, you sell drugs but you have an incredibly strict father, and you notice your new next door neighbour at a party.  Do you A) introduce yourself, chat to the guy, find out if he's the sort who will report you to the police etc. before making your move or B) march right up and offer the dope to him there and then because it expedites the action? Or how about the daughter's friend towards the end of the movie.  You're 16 years old, you've just had a blazing row with your best friend, and your car is parked outside.  Do you A) run off, leave the house asap, and drive straight home, or B) slink off downstairs and hang around interminably just in case Kevin Spacey shows up to carry out his perverted, sub-Lolita fantasy?  I could go on all day...<br/><br/>The direction is, dare I say it, directionless.  Sam Mendes should stick to his so-called risque theatre productions at the Donmar Warehouse.  His debut film, as I have intimated, reeks of incoherence.  In addition to the tonal uncertainty, there is no clear directorial vision.  The only memorable images are borrowed from ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Lolita"", the rest of the time it seems to be left to the cast to try to carry the picture, whether through Bening's OTT hyperactivity or Wes Bentley understatement.  When you look at ""The Straight Story"", or ""The Insider"", or even ""The Sixth Sense"", it galls me to think that this has been nominated for Best Direction...<br/><br/>That this movie is so highly rated by critics, IMDb users, and Oscar personnel, is a great shame, because ultimately its success is a testament to people's stupidity.  A (substantial) crowd of non-thinking buffoons, easily satisfied by the occasional cheap laugh and a couple of relatively strong performances have been sold a complete lemon.  This film is not deep. There is no coherent philosophical notion of either truth or beauty evident.  A few shots of Ricky Fitts looking sullen and waving his camcorder around do not, I'm afraid, amount to a radical thesis on the nature of the world.  And nothing can get over the contrived, episodic nature of this D-grade screenplay.<br/><br/>Someone earlier on this comments page claimed that they could not like anyone who didn't love ""American Beauty"", for it would mean that they have no soul.  Well babe, by the same token, I will proudly say that anyone who does like this movie can't be my friend, because they clearly have no brain. Look closer everyone, I implore you.  Frankly, ""American Pie"" is a more profound movie.  Dump this rubbish and go and see ""The Insider"".  Think for yourself, if you're able...<br/><br/>My rating: 3 (/10)"
"sosodop","1","105","219","14 January 2001"," The zenith of self-consciously pseudo-profound inanity!
","Someone put it best in one of the reviews I read earlier: This movie is exactly the result of people trying to make a so-called art movie and still win the best picture oscar. American Beauty shamelessly trots out every imaginable convention of what an art movie is and then glosses it over with cute shooting, a relatively short run time and face pace. It says virtually nothing about any of the supposedly unusual or profound content that ostensibly is its subject matter. Apparently issues of would-be gravity making cameo apperaances constitutes a profound social comment. It is a great jumble of clichés (spoilers here maybe): The neurotic wife, the homophobic army man (That he turns out to be gay is not of any consequence since anything serious is not given attention in the film, it is a cute afterthought. Though it would be a serious point if this movie had anything to do with reality)The white collar dick with a mid-life crisis, the artist who sees beauty where no one else can, the pretending promiscuous cheerleader. Are there any characters that aren't stock? I cant believe anyone commented that this is in any way realistic. This is not a portrayal of of American life. In reality the teenager with an abusive psychotic homicidal father does not have 40,000$ and cannot conveniently run away to his friends in NYC. The middle-aged man unjustly fired from his job does not conveniently have information he can use to blackmail his bosses for 60,000$ and live happily ever after. Living in a duplex as a teenager is nothing resembling duress; that would be living on less that one U.S. dollar a day as millions of people do. This could easily qualify as propaganda: When you are rich you dont have to worry, your problem is only that you are not looking ""beneath the surface"" to see the true hedonistic beauty that life is really made of. Well I agree that this beauty does exist. Unfortunately though I am going to burst the bubble of one of the supposedly most profound scenes in the movie: The plastic bag. Look closer, they say, and you will see the beauty in reality. Yes! but this is not reality! Plastic Bags do not blow in circles for 15 minutes. That scene could practically never have occurred in nature; Im sorry I did look closer and it was so obviously being manipulated off camera that it was absurd. That sums up the movie fairly: Look at what we call beauty, we say it is natural but we are really manipulating it. If wind machines (or whatever they are technically called) are really the wind then this movie is really based in reality. Sam Mendes and Alan (whatever his last name is, the writer) are daring the viewer to be as dumb and gullible as they hope they can be. And to my amazement they succeed. If we throw together a whole bunch of artistic clichés and it doesnt make sense to you then you are dumb. Anyone who has a modicum of sanity and any concept of criticism has seen this movie as the charade it is and I stand firmly in their camp. I literally exclaimed out loud (though I was by myself) ""What the F**k??!!"" at the beginning when Kevin Spacey says ""In a way I am already dying (paraphrased)"". It is the zenith of self-consciously pseudo-profound inanity.<br/><br/>Disclaimer for the inflammatory nature of this post: This is really just intended to be a rant as I am insensed at how many people cant see this movie for what it really is. I am not trying to analyze this movie in a deliberate or cogent way. If any wants me to argue more clearly then email me. And you will get a more thoughtful earful than this."

Apathy doesn't seem so apathetic when you've devalued everything! This was a story about a loser, who KNEW he was a loser, but rather than do anything about it, he instead deluded himself into believing that he was something more BY LOWERING HIS STANDARD OF JUDGMENT. No different than if he were a C student in school that made himself feel better by saying that C's are the same thing as A's. It's nonsense. It's utter nonsense.<br/><br/>American Beauty is horrible. It is, without a doubt, one of the single worst stories ever written. You want to know why?

When EVERYTHING is beautiful, NOTHING is. And you know what happens then? Congratulations - you've killed man's sense of values. You've killed his capacity to recognize greatness or to achieve it.<br/><br/>If you set up standards of achievement open to all, to the least, to the most inept - you stop the impetus to effort in all men, great or small. You stop all incentive to improvement, to excellence, to perfection.<br/><br/>And that's EXACTLY what happened to the ""protaganist"" (although it makes me want to spit acid to even call him that) in American Beauty.

Personally, I love it -from the first sight, from the last sight, from the eternal sight. It is my favorite film of the 90s, one of my personal twenty favorites ever. I think that American Beauty is an instant classic, and it will stay that way as long as people watch movies.<br/><br/>The film is deep, dark, and tragic. The title is American Beauty but it is more like Universal Sadness. It is not about superheroes - it is about very flawed, tired, and shallow people  but just as the tag line says  one must look closer.<br/><br/>I live in a town like the one in American Beauty too - nice houses, brick, vinyl, neatly cut grass and flowers. ""The air is fresh and sweet like a child's kiss"". I jog in the mornings or in the evenings and people often sit on their porches or water their lawns or jog just as I do. We always smile at each other and say ""Hi, how are you?"" I always think to myself - what goes on beyond the closed doors of these people that I see? They could be happy with their families and with their jobs. They do look happy. Or, they may be tired and disappointed with their lives, trying to do something to change it - or just letting the days pass by.<br/><br/>Leo Tolstoy opened his novel Anna Karenina with the words, ""All happy families are happy in the same way; each unhappy family is unique in its unhappiness"". That's why it is much more interesting for me to try and understand each unhappy family  why did it happen? The family in American Beauty used to be happy - there is even proof - the photograph with three of them, happy, laughing. Where did it go? When? Why? When was the moment in time when two loving people became strangers and prisoners in their own nice house with the beautiful roses outside? These are the questions I kept thinking about when I saw AB for the first time, and I still can not find the answers. Can something be changed? How? What do you do to wake up from the lethargic dream that your life has become? How do you reach the people who are the closest to you? What the hell do you need a $3000 couch for if you can not make love to your wife on it? What is the purpose of material possessions if they become more important than the smile of your daughter? When did you start to think that giving your children the best toys possible would substitute for a talk, for a sincere and honest interest as to what they really worry about? I did not find American Beauty patronizing and simplistic - it asks difficult questions but does not provide you with any easy answers. I still look for those answers. I don't blame the movie for imperfection of its characters - I know they do exist. We don't like them - but can one be mad when looking in the mirror? I want to add a couple of words about Spacey's character, Lester Burnham (BTW, Spacey may stop acting right now, and he probably should after all the flops he has produced since AB, but he will always be remembered for Lester). Lester could say about himself what another flawed but unforgettable character did 25 years before him: ""Well, I tried, didn't I? Goddamnit, at least I did that."" Lester Burnham died a happy man; the last words he heard in his life were that his daughter was in love - it meant for him that she could feel, that she was alive because love changes us and makes us better. His last sight was that of a picture where happiness and joy were captured forever. In death, he had at last captured that for which he had longed for the most in life  happiness.<br/><br/>He died a happy man - not many do."

","Okay, so I don't think there's much left to be said about this masterpiece. ""American Beauty"" is one of those rare instant classics, a landmark of the 90's and one of the best debut features ever (which is both a blessing and a curse for a director - let's hope Sam Mendes doesn't end up like Orson Welles).<br/><br/>This bittersweet tale of ordinary suburban lives about an average husband (Kevin Spacey), his ambitious wife (Annette Bening), their unhappy only child (Thora Birch), the weirdo next door (Wes Bentley), his severe father (Chris Cooper), his catatonic mother (Allison Janney) and a certain blonde cheerleader (Mena Suvari), reaches a heavenly level of authenticity and poignancy thanks to a witty, pitch-perfect script (by Alan Ball, who would later create the brilliant TV series ""Six Feet Under""), a wonderful cast (Spacey and Cooper, especially), Mendes's sensible directing, Conrad L. Hall's beautiful cinematography and Thomas Newman's unforgettable score (which has been copied ad nauseam since then, by the way). <br/><br/>""American Beauty"" is as thought-provoking and sad as it is, in a weird way, uplifting. To realize the mediocrity in your life; to try to change it or let it be, that's the question. Whichever's your choice, there'll be a high price to pay; thus, no one's a complete hero or villain in this story. Lack of communication, character flaws and hypocrisy all add up to what happens to these people; we feel bad for them, despise them, and root for them, for they all ring so true. That's because they're real, and great writers like Ball have a special talent to expose the good, the bad and the ugly in human nature.<br/><br/>My only ""problem"" with this film is that it came out in 1999 (one of the greatest years for films, ever), just like my all-time favourite, ""Magnolia"", which was almost completely snubbed by the Academy (which gave ""American Beauty"" 5 Oscars, including Best Picture and Director). Naturally, I'd have liked ""Magnolia"" to win, but AB is a more than acceptable replacement since the Academy actually awarded a great film that year. ""American Beauty"", even without being the best film of its year, still manages to be a masterpiece.<br/><br/>""It's just a couch!"", Lester (Spacey) yells in one scene. ""This isn't life, it's just stuff. And it's become more important to you than living. Well, honey, that's just nuts"".<br/><br/>And isn't he right? <br/><br/>...look closer. 10/10."

","Transcendent. A marvel of a film. There are an astonishing number of themes that are each explored and strongly supported by the cinematography, and that makes this film different each time you watch it. I chose to recognize authenticity and redemption as the central themes, especially considering the 'look closer' tagline. The smart and subtle uses of color support several themes, but are also subliminally subversive. The cinematography in American Beauty and the myriad goals it accomplishes are nothing short of genius and quite nearly mind control. Mendes' direction here is a staple of self-control and fearlessness in Hollywood. Spacey's performance was shockingly powerful and resonant. Everything just works, even the mishaps. My only caveat: with so many themes, it feels as though they are wrestling for attention. I felt forced to focus on the satirical aspect of the film, which becomes lacking. It's not that the film is beyond comprehension, rather the themes begin to contradict one another, producing a sort of unwanted chaotic element that is detrimental to the greater lessons to be learned. But the achievements in American Beauty cannot be ignored. You can spend days watching this film, trying to wrap your head around the beautiful meaning of life that it presents you with. But it's for you to determine what that meaning is. Top 500 film. 8/10 — ￼watching American Beauty."
"Jared_Andrews","7","8","12","18 August 2016"," Delivers a beautiful, lasting message
","When I first watched American Beauty, I was in awe. To many, this feeling was mutual. I, like most viewers, felt as if I had just witnessed the ultimate achievement in cinema—a film that actually changed my life. I thought it was the deepest, most profound film ever. I believed the message. I was ready to appreciate all the beauty in the world.<br/><br/>Fast forward a few years, my view changed. American Beauty is creepy and pretentious and stomach churningly awkward and so over the top at times that it elicits eye rolls. <br/><br/>I don't mean to rip the movie completely. Upon second viewing, I still enjoyed it immensely. It's aware and insightful, even if it's not quite as profound as everyone believed 15 years ago. <br/><br/>In any case, American Beauty remains an Oscar worthy movie, in part, because of the flawless acting of Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey, who play two iconic roles even though they're essentially playing clichés, which is a super under-appreciated accomplishment. <br/><br/>Seriously, think about it. They play a nuclear suburban couple in an ordinary neighborhood with an ordinary teenage daughter (despite what Ricky thinks about her) and ordinary family issues. Even the greatest sources of conflict in the movie (her affair and his mid-life crisis) are exceedingly ordinary. And still they manage to give extraordinary and lasting performances. Impressive work.<br/><br/>All that ordinary really serves as the point of the film. Ricky, the kid who films stuff, sees things that most people consider ordinary and frames them in his mind as ""beautiful."" To an extent, he has a wonderful, enlightened perspective. Except for when he crosses the threshold into weird. <br/><br/>Case and point: ""Ricky, why are you filming that dead bird?"" <br/><br/>""Because it's beautiful."" <br/><br/>That's an iffy assertion at best, Ricky. I'm all about finding beauty in everyday places, but I find many things a heckuva lot more beautiful than a dead bird. For one, a living bird.<br/><br/>American Beauty has a worthwhile message; we've established that. But the message means little if not delivered properly. Thankfully it is.<br/><br/>In fact the message delivery is the strength of the film. Its effectiveness lies in its ability to present this family living the American dream, a ubiquitous concept, while exploring it with a deep, multi-perspective approach.<br/><br/>It deconstructs the whole concept of the American dream. We see the nuclear family—husband, wife and daughter. They live in a nice house in a beautiful neighborhood. The parents each work good jobs. The daughter attends a nice school. They should all be perfectly happy. Yet <br/><br/>As we peel back the layers, we see the flaws. The daughter hates her parents and struggles to fit in at high school. Mom tries and fails to connect with her daughter while she also tries and fails at work. Dad seems to have lost interest in all things aside from lusting after his daughter's teenage friend.<br/><br/>They are miserable.<br/><br/>This all forces us to ask: this is the American dream? What's so great about this? As the story ultimately winds to its conclusion, it arrives at the restoration of hope in the form of a super weird and creepy character experiencing an epiphany. *NOTE* I'm talking about Lester (Kevin Spacey), not Ricky, even though he is also creepy and weird. I know I hit on this already, but it demands a second mention. Quite frankly Ricky is more than just strange. He's kind of a pompous tool who is largely responsible for taking the movie from profound to ""come on dude, it's just a plastic bag"" levels of pretentiousness. It almost makes me glad President Snow killed him at the end of The Hunger Games 13 years later.<br/><br/>How perfect is that role for him? When you picture Ricky 13 years later, can't you totally imagine him designing the layout of a game in which kids fight to the death? It makes perfect sense to me. He would probably think The Hunger Games are beautiful. *END OF NOTE* Anyway, back to Lester's epiphany.<br/><br/>Lester turned his life around, in large part, due to his pursuit of a fantasy. But when he had a chance to live that fantasy, he turned it down. That was his epiphany. His real one, not the one he thought he had after smoking weed with Ricky.<br/><br/>No, that night with Angela was the moment of his true breakthrough. He realizes that lusting after his daughter's friend is icky. More than that, he started to see things for what they really were. His fantasy girl was really just an innocent, vulnerable teenager. His daughter was really a special young lady he raised. His wife was really the woman he fell in love with.<br/><br/>Being with Angela was not what he really wanted. He had what he wanted all along. Even with his current problems, he chose his reality over his fantasy. He had a wife, a daughter, a great life. Somewhere along the way he just forgot.<br/><br/>I could probably ramble for another few thousand words about this movie, I better wrap things up.<br/><br/>American Beauty sends a worthy message about appreciating the little things in life, the ones most of us take for granted. Experiencing the movie is like swimming through gorgeous ocean water in the Caribbean. It's wonderful, you just have to navigate through the seaweed of affairs and ignore the gross oil spill doubling as a 40 year old guy fantasizing about banging a high school cheerleader.<br/><br/>If you can do that, you will take away something useful from this movie. And you'll have a fun time while you do it."

","American Beauty. By title and cover I was expecting some unoriginal romantic comedy, but it turned out I didn't really have a clue as to what was waiting for me. I bought it on coincidence - it was on sale at a supermarket store. I'm grateful for the nature of coincidence.<br/><br/>Curiously, I loaded up the opening scene. A girl wanting to kill her father. This was hardly the comedy I was thinking it would be. But what was it then...? The movie goes on and the father - Lester Burnham initiates a voice-over, accounting for his current life or lack there of. In calm honesty he shamelessly confesses the failure he considers himself to be. Furthermore, he condemns and rejects the moral values and norms that he has apparently been living with for very long, as he has come to realize that they don't provide the any joy in his life. This was something that spoke to my mind. It felt very real.<br/><br/>This is a movie about rebellion. Rebellion towards your surroundings for having evolved into a character you cannot identify with. For petrifying emotionally and personally inside as a sacrifice to conform into the life you're supposedly living.<br/><br/>During Lesters initial voice-over, we're told that Lester will be dead within a year and Lester tells us that, in a way, he feels as though he's already dead.<br/><br/>Lester doesn't really become aware of what he's missing until one night, when he's dragged to a sports event by his wife, in order to watch his daughter perform as a cheerleader. During the performance, Lester spots Angela, a high-school friend of his daughter and a beautiful girl. Suddenly, Lester realizes that he's missing something, that he needs something and the following nights he's dreaming about this girl. During these days, a series of incidents wakes up Lester and he radically begins reshaping his character.<br/><br/>The movie continues and at the end Lester does die - just like he predicted, but he didn't die as a dead man. He died very alive.<br/><br/>This movie had a significant meaning for me in my teenage years searching for identity. It served as inspiration for my character. It's a savoring, yet nutritious meal for anyone hungering for genuine beauty.<br/><br/>Everyone here are urging you to look closer at this movie. Don't hesitate. Do it. You won't regret it."

Oh the ""repressed homosexual did it"" who didn't see this coming?  Thank goodness they didn't use the other ending where the drug dealin' kid gets arrested, that would have been even less plausible.  The wife is coming home with a gun, motive - none.  What, she wants to leave her husband so she kills him? Please.  The neighbor boy kills him to take his daughter to NYC, motive - none.  They can just walk out the door.  Oh, but the marine finally realizes he's gay so he kills Spacey.  Give me a break.  I can see the studio execs now, sitting around a table convincing themselves this was a good movie, then sending out the cash to the Academy members to convince them.  The movie would have been much better if A) the marine killed himself instead of, or after, killing Spacey.  B) the marine has a breakdown resulting in no deaths. or C) I had stayed home and rented the Usual Suspects instead.  What a waste of Kevin Spacey's ability."

","Much-praised film about a man facing mid-life crisis in suburbia, dreaming of playing Humbert Humbert to a Lolita that is his daughter's friend. There is only one word to describe this film: pretentious. Mendes thinks he is making the Great American Motion Picture but it is populated with cookie-cutter characters and it superficially touches on what the filmmakers regard as important themes. The acting is mediocre at best. Spacey gives the kind of performance that the Academy loves and awarded him with the Oscar but his acting here can be best described as mugging. Benning does not fare much better as his desperate wife."

","This film was terrible. Not in an Ed Wood way - Spacey and Bening are fine actors, and carry off the risible dialogue with conviction - but in conception and script, and direction. Never has a film so enraged me (for ripping me off) and bored me simultaneously. A friend said, ""ah, but it's good to smack Americans."" I said, ""Ah, but it's too easy, and that's not America, nor anything near it.""<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film is about an underdeveloped scapegrace, who should sitdown and get some counseling. His wife is a frigid slut, and the daughter is a freak. Now these should make a good film, but it doesn't. It makes a dull, repetitive, uninsightful night. A night at the laundromat is much better than an hour and a half in this mediocre tedium<br/><br/>Miss it. You won't regret it."
"tonyf-2","1","36","78","26 June 2000"," Extremely Disappointing
","This movie shows just how little the Academy knows about film.  It is predictable, derivative, and inane, yet it wins Oscars left and right. Perhaps this ""charming"" little flick about a middle aged man who calls his daughter's underaged friend and almost seduces the girl is appealing to all those Woody Allens out there, but to me it was just another Hollywood excuse to show young women's breasts on screen (which, of course, means they can now win Oscars).<br/><br/>But what really makes the film so deplorable is the insipid script, a plot that is so unbelievable that it forces the Hollywood hacks working on it to create silly situations just so the ending can occur (maybe the plot was written back asswards, which would explain the manipulated dialogue and plot lines that are needed to get to the murder), and over-the-top, cartoonish characterization by all the adult actors involved. The only beauty in this film occurs when the young actors, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mina Suvari are interacting in a scene. The three have true chemistry, and their actions and emotions are so much less forced than those of Spacey and Annette Benning (who should be embarrassed by her acting in this film, truly).  Perhaps the writing/directing team of Alan Ball/Sam Mendes was more comfortable with adolescence than with adulthood, which is not surprising for Hollywood.<br/><br/>I suppose what really ticks me off about this film is that it did win the Oscar, over films that were so much better than itself (Fight Club, Magnolia, Three Kings, Boys Don't Cry), thereby setting the stage for even more insipid junk like itself to inundate our theaters.  Maybe the woeful movies that have been released so far in 2000 is a direct result of the exultation of such tripe by Hollywood and the viewing public."
"markus_fekal","9","6","9","29 October 2018"," The Beauty of American Beauty
","The American Beauty is a movie about - you guessed it - beauty. And not only are we talking about appearance, but also the beauty of the simplest things in life. As the main character says, ""Today is the first day of the rest of your life"". And you'll know it full well when you reach the end of this masterpiece.<br/><br/>The movie was released in 1999 and directed by Sam Mendes. Kevin Spacey, embodied into Lester Burnham, tells a story about a middle-aged father trying to sort his life out. And his unbalanced in life wife Carolyn and anxious, misunderstood daughter Jane are really not helping him out. Each of them have their flaws and seeing them struggling to straighten things out is a true pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>Now, right off the bat I want to say I've loved the movie. Seeing the plot unravel and the characters change in meaningful ways is frankly astonishing. Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening (as Carolyn) and Wes Bentley (as Ricky, a creepy neighbour next door) really outdid themselves in this one. At first they caused me to cringe horribly (obviously as intended). But later on with their engaging performances we realize how endearing and relatable these people are. Discovering their complex (or sometimes the simplest) views on life really warms a viewer's heart.<br/><br/>The movie was quite funny and I've lol'd a few times. The tone is mostly light - the audience can relax and enjoy a good film. What we also need to talk about is the soundtrack, which absolutely appealed to me. The music really gave the atmosphere of the movie a nice touch. And last thing, the dialogues were top notch, mainly the ones between Lester and Carolyn. The asparagus scene genuinely amazed me and it's definitely gonna stay on my mind for some time.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the filmmaker was successful in his role - making me self-reflect and have a good time. The charming characters and their complex stories are truly worth a rewatch. American Beauty is certainly a title I'll come back to."

","Watching ""American Beauty"" is like looking into a handful of American lives slowly plunging into moral and emotional devastation. Although these people are gaining a sincerely fulfilling happiness, they are also slowly losing their grip on human value and order. This is not your average social commentary, it has something most satires lack; poignancy. On one hand, this is a scathing examination of the facades and truths that surround a seemingly ""perfect"" suburban family, displaying what it would be like if everyone's true colours emerged, as they liberate themselves from the painful phoniness that society forces them to live by. One the other hand, ""American Beauty"" is a thought-provoking and emotionally devastating character study of two families finally achieving joy for the first time in their lives, unaware of the profound impact they are having on themselves and each other, and neglecting the consequences that will inevitably follow. ""American Beauty"" shines in almost everyway, from it's stunning imagery of beauty fused with violence and tragedy, to it's darkly hilarious script, this is one of those rare films that stay with you for a long time. But the main thing that makes this movie soar are the performances, Kevin Spacey and Anette Benning are simply sensational as the feuding married couple exploring new realms of life,  Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Mena Suvari and Thora Birch also showcase excellent performances. A truly remarkable film."

","The first time I saw ""American Beauty"" was when I was around 8 years old so it's a hazy memory. Unfortunately I had to go to bed about 40 minutes in, but some scenes have stayed with me since (I'm 17 now). The second time I saw American Beauty was on the eve of my blonde friend's birthday party (I must've been around 15) and I was totally gripped. Unfortunately I had to force myself to bed as it was on late, and left 40 minutes in, in order to be awake-looking for the early morning start the next day. Yesterday, I finally got the chance to see American Beauty the whole way through. And it was amazing.<br/><br/>Those first 40 minutes hadn't really left my head before. They were just absolutely gripping, full of incredible visuals, cinematography and absorbing writing and character development. Thankfully, the rest of the film doesn't disappoint either and accumulates to being one of the greatest films I have ever seen. I wasn't expecting to give it a perfect 10, as I only reserve that for the most special films, but this really is an incredible and outstanding film. It thoroughly deserves its best picture award!<br/><br/>What makes American Beauty works is its well-observed characters. At the centre of the film we've got Lester Burnham, who is fantastically played by Kevin Spacey (another throughly deserving award winner) and is going through a mid-life crisis. We can highly sympathise with him and his childish rebellion. You feel sorry for him and his loveless marriage, his ill relationship with his daughter and unforgiving job. You're almost rooting for him when he rebells. However, his acutely observed character is also wonderfully flawed by taking drugs and having vivid fantasies about his daughter's which are beautifully filmed.<br/><br/>The other characters are also as gripping and never shunned. We've got his controlling wife, also going through a mid-life breakdown, his moody daughter and her sexy friend as well as the weird family who've moved in next door, with their strange son and awful army dad. The film would need very little plot at all to keep it entertaining as all the characters are memorable and well-crafted, which means American Beauty never has a dull moment. Right from the startling opening, which confesses that Lester is going to die, the film never loses its grip on the audience as we're all in suspense as to who kills Lester and why!<br/><br/>The playful screenplay by Alan Ball is incredible. It's also philosophical and very deep at times, as well as being consistently gripping and entertaining. There are some hilarious moments as well as some emotional and touching ones. As flawless as the script is the directing by Kate Winslet's ex. There is some breath-taking cinematography and striking visuals which add fuel to the already high burning fire. About every single shot is perfectly framed, making the film even more involving and seductive. American Beauty felt hypnotic at times, sucking you into the world of the film like Black Swan and The Artist achieved so memorably.<br/><br/>American Beauty builds up to an incredibly powerful and emotionally-charged ending. Bringing together all the characters and leaving some ambiguity, so we don't feel at all patronised. Lester's final narration is very touching, memorable and rounds the film off perfectly. American Beauty is an amazing achievement in film-making. It's a beautifully observed drama about family life and the baggage which comes with it. There's great use of humour, superb writing, Oscar-worthy acting and sensational directing. American Beauty is the full package and is quite simply one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It was worth the 9 year wait!"

","A definite addition to my Ten Best List for 1999,  is AMERICAN BEAUTY which is sure to earn Kevin Spacey, Annette Benning  (robbed in the past for her work in BUGSY and THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT),  and Alan Ball (most original screenplay to come along in awhile), Oscar nominations. It is the story of what suburban life and the pursuit of the American Dream can do to an American Family. But unlike the critic's darling from a few years ago ICE STORM, which left me freezing, this film is genuinely funny and moving at the same time. The ideas projected by director Sam Mendes literally leap off the screen.  Spacey's edgy performance as the ad exec pushed over the brink by the pressures of having to have it all and his passion for ""The American Beauty""  he missed when he was young enough to enjoy it, offer a visual feast.  Annette Benning as the Queen of suburbia, Spacey's wife, is  a sort sexy, gorgeous, Martha Stewart gone mad, convinced if she has just one more motivational seminar she will reach nirvana.  She is in a word ""wonderful."" The boy next door is sort of cross between Timothy Hutton in ORDINARY PEOPLE and Benjamin in THE GRADUATE.  He deals drugs, observes life around him through a video camera and convinces almost everyone that he is the straight arrow next door.  We know immediately, that like everyone else in this movie, he is not as he appears.  AMERICAN BEAUTY peals away, layer by layer, this oh so imperfect world of suburbia and those in denial who live there. If you have already seen NOTTING HILL you NEED to see AMERICAN BEAUTY."

"riz-5","1","32","70","7 March 2000"," American Stereotypes
","This movie had a huge ""Look ma I'm an Artist"" splashed over the screen. Where to begin? In no particular order:<br/><br/>* The first scene we see is Spacey jerking off in the shower; that is the highlight of the movie. Characters aren't developed, they are changed - sometimes unnecessarily (the ex-marine ....in the end... was it an attempt to shock or to make somebody laugh?)<br/><br/>* Spacey realizes that the things he owned ended up owning him; in the light of this revelation he buys a car.<br/><br/>* Talk about stereotypes... every teenager is depressed, they all hate or despise their parents, and they are either quite stupid or deep and wise. The ex-marine and his wife would have been quite funny in a lighter movie, but they are treated too seriously here.<br/><br/>* The fact that the blonde was a virgin was quite clear from frame zero (again, an attempt to shock with a sudden revelation?)<br/><br/>* The garbage moved by the wind is mistaken for art in the States. Let me quote another movie with Annette Bening: ""They're so thirsty for it they'll crawl through the desert toward a mirage, and when they discover there's no water, they'll drink the sand.""<br/><br/>* The witty, caustic dialogue isn't there. There are three or four good oneliners, but nothing to write home about - everything had an already-heard, leftover taste. Academy award for Non Sequitur: ""I'll go to the bathroom"", uttered by the dumb blonde to push us into the next scene, where Spacey had to be alone.<br/><br/>* Career-driven people may be interesting for american moviegoers, but everywhere else we realize that the priorities of those people are messed up, so it's harder for us to feel sad for those poor jerks when they turn forty and suddenly wake up. ""Because a man that doesn't spend time with his family, can never be a real man"" (now, _that_ was a great movie.)<br/><br/>* A note about the soundtrack: anybody playing the piano should use at least three fingers, unless they want to beat the world record for annoying music.<br/><br/>To make a long story short: the people around me laughed loudly in the first 10/15 minutes, then began to chuckle as the realization that they had burned 10$ slowly crept over them. After the first hour the theatre was silent, and I began watching the upholstery of the chair in front of me on the basis that it was slightly more interesting than what was going on on the screen. I spent the last thirty minutes listening for the sound of dying brain cells. Later I talked to 10+ people and they all said that this was a lousy movie, except for a girl who said that ""she loves everything made by Altman"" (yeah, right). I really wonder how this movie made it to the top ten list. Too bad I'm not allowed to give negative marks on the IMDB."
"Kronos-8","1","35","78","5 April 2000"," American Beauty isn't
","At the end of this film, Kevin Spacey's character talks about the idea of one's life passing before one's eyes at the point of death. If such a phenomena is true, then I fervently pray that, at the moment of my demise, the two-plus hours I sat in the theatre watching this dreadful movie will be omitted by the Great Film Editor in the Sky. I knew as I left the theatre, long before the awards, that this movie would win the Oscar for Best Picture. It's EXACTLY the sort of condescending, self-important tripe that Hollywood likes to honor. Both ""The Insider"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" were superior movies. I'm no genius, but I demand that a movie be smarter than I. I knew every plot ""twist"" five minutes before it happened, only erring on when Lester would be killed, but not by whom. Unbelievably stereotyped characters. Not particularly funny. I guess that because Lester beats off in the shower or lusts after an underage girl, we are supposed to think this movie is worthy of praise. I wonder how many people would praise the movie if Lester had lusted after an underage BOY? The ONLY good scene was the film within the film -- lovely and poetic. But one scene does not a good movie make, let alone a Best Picture. ""American Beauty"" is nothing more than an extended sitcom (though one that would only be shown on HBO). An utter waste of time. The Hollywood marketing machine has pulled off another cultural coup."

A lot of this film is some snappy one-liners or clever scenes strung together with...nothing.  Everything that happens is almost laughably predictable. And the crucial scene, where an empty plastic bag blowing in the wind is supposed to impart some deep meaning on the true nature of existence in the phenomenal world?  Right.  Finally, I must comment on Annette Bening, who is one of the better actresses working today being cast in the role of a cartoon...what a waste.<br/><br/>This film is a ""1,"" and should in fact have a turkey symbol next to it.

American Beauty was one of the biggest turkeys I've ever seen. I very nearly walked out on it, which is something I don't do. I found the plot contrived and predictable and the characters cartoonish. The suburban schlub Dad? The frustrated wife? The brooding teenager? The closeted gay psychopath? These aren't characters, they're cliches. Spacey and Benning were good, as they always are, but no actor can rescue a script this far down in the trash. The scene with the bag blowing in the wind was the single most brainless thing I've ever seen in a movie, except in Z-grade sci fi or horror (and it gives some of those films a run for their money.) This pic would be perfect for MST3K if it weren't so brain-deadeningly dull. I came expecting intelligent, engaging drama. All I got was overwrought, amateurish nonsense."

","I have to agree with those IMDb reviewers who simply cannot understand how this movie won the Best Picture award or for that matter, how it is even considered a good film. It's nothing more than an overblown, exaggerated view of a dysfunctional family set to the backdrop of a suburban lifestyle that, for the most part, seems totally unrealistic. While Kevin Spacey usually turns in consistent performances (although he always seems to play rather offbeat characters), I felt his performance here was very weak. He plays a middle-aged man going through his midlife crisis period but to me, just seems unconvincing. Even Annette Benning's performance seemed way below par. Quite frankly, definitely not worthy of Best Picture and not one that I would want to own."

I could write a whole book about the significance and meaning of every artistic shot, of every remarkable performance, and every event and still not capture the essence of this movie.<br/><br/>The truth is that this is the most complete portrayal of human emotion and interaction I have ever seen. It encompasses every aspect of mankind; from jealousy and intolerance, to romance and happiness. Every single aspect of each scene has a meaning and message, and if your mind is open, then this movie will affect you in so many ways.<br/><br/>On a more technical note, this movie is not only superbly written, but executed flawlessly. Kevin Spacey gives the performance of the century, hitting every nuance of his character with grace and style. In a lesser movie, his performance would have been the sole reason to watch. Yet this is not the case. Annette Benning also shines with her portrayal of a troubled housewife that is nothing short of Oscar-worthy. The musical score also stands out as a fantastic attribute of the experience; not overpowering, yet still just as relevant.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the flawless cinematography and lighting effects and such.

That's because most of the scenes (including a misuse of shampoo in the shower) are completely over-the-top. The director should have cut out any dramatic pretenses and went with a Zucker-Abrams-Zucker comedy concept. Kevin Spacey's character is a jerk; he loses his job ""unfairly,"" and immediately turns around and blackmails his boss. Then, he buys a sports car, smokes ""100% safe weed,"" and hates his life as it is, until he re-discovers ""puppy love."" Good for him? Annette Benning's character is all right, the rest of the characters are stupid, and I forgot Allison Janney was in the movie.

Yikes! pass me some G-13. There really are only two good segments: Lester in the drive-up window, and Lester with the R-C car. That's about 3 1/2 minutes worth of movie. Were there plot twists?

"billreynolds","1","19","42","24 August 2001"," sexist and unrealistic
","This movie grossed an incredible $336 million worldwide, won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1999, and occupies the remarkably lofty position of the ninth best movie ever made on the IMDB Top 250.  And frankly, I can't understand why.  It's a well-made and well-acted movie, but I find the story offensive and irritating in many respects.<br/><br/>(1) Setting.  This is a minor point, but the setting is very inconsistently handled.  Obviously the movie was actually filmed in the LA area, but there are references to ""those days when it's a minute away from snowing"" (which a Southern Californian would obviously not say) and to Jane and Ricky escaping to New York City.  On the other hand, the potential homebuyers complain to Carolyn that the house she is selling was supposed to have a ""lagoon"" in back.  Well, in the eastern U.S., realtors don't talk about lagoons - that is a very SoCal term.<br/><br/>More importantly, I found it incredibly irritating how the Burnhams live in a huge, lavishly decorated, modern home on the exclusive ""Robin Hood Trail."" This house is worth easily $1 million.  How, exactly, did they afford it, given that Lester has been a technical writer for an advertising magazine (working in a small cubicle) for fourteen years and Carolyn is a struggling realtor who personally cleans the crappy houses she is trying to sell?  And how do the Fittses manage to afford the equally fancy house next door on a Marine colonel's salary?  Only the Jims (the tax attorney and anesthesiologist) belong in this neighborhood.  This phoniness undercuts the story (and anything it might have to ""say"" about America) from the beginning, in my opinion.<br/><br/>(2) Sexism.  There are four female characters - Carolyn, Jane, Angela, and Mrs. Fitts.  Carolyn is portrayed as cold and mean - two qualities that just happen to go along with the fact that she is also ambitious and hard-working.  She also, as we see, does the cooking (and undoubtedly the rest of the housework), but Lester is still dissatisfied with her.  He calls her a ""bloodless, money-grubbing freak.""  Well, sorry, but I just didn't agree with that.  I thought Carolyn was the most sympathetic character in the movie.  I never understood what Lester was so upset about at the beginning of the story.  Why did he hate Carolyn?  Because she wouldn't have sex with him?  That seemed to be what it boiled down to.  And because her gardening clogs matched the handle on her pruning shears.  Why didn't he admire her for her success as a broker, appreciate her efforts around the house, be supportive of her, instead of falling for a seventeen-year-old girl?  It really bothered me that when he gave examples of the person Carolyn used to be and (in his opinion) should become again, he talked about her faking seizures at frat parties and running to the roof of an apartment building to flash traffic helicopters.  So instead of an attractive, hard-working, responsible woman in her early forties, he wants a sexualized nut case?  That doesn't resonate with me.<br/><br/>Then there's Jane.  The first thing we learn about her is that she wants breast enlargement surgery and that she's secretly saved up money to pay for it.  And that's about it.  We learn she hates her parents, although at the start of the movie it's not clear why.  I'm sorry, but in the real world, kids (even teenagers) don't just hate their parents without any reason, and here the reason isn't shown.  We see a photograph from a few years earlier when they were a happy family - so the suggestion, I think, is that the problems started when Carolyn got her real estate license.  I find that a pretty sinister message - ""when Mom stops being just a housewife, the American family goes to hell.""<br/><br/>For Jane as for Carolyn, their male counterparts get the best lines.  It's Ricky and then later Lester who give the movie's thematic speech about there being ""so much beauty in the world.""  Jane and Carolyn just play off the men.  Jane never really does anything to justify Ricky's fascination with her - it's apparently based solely on her striking and unusual looks.<br/><br/>And that brings us to Angela, played by Mena Suvari.  Any movie that portrays a 40-year-old man obsessed with an 18-year-old girl (the friend of his daughter) as a hero has got something wrong with it.  There is no excuse for that.  I don't think it's ""normal"" for a man that age to have that kind of obsession.  He might notice the attractiveness of such a young woman, but to become obsessed with her is disgusting, in my opinion.  At least when Carolyn had an affair, it was with a man her own age.<br/><br/>And what is the one thing we know about Angela as a person (aside from her looks)?  That she wants to be a model.  So of our two young female characters, one wants breast implants and the other wants to be a model. Nice image of women for the future.<br/><br/>I don't have space to get into Mrs. Fitts, the other female character, who is like a catatonic version of a Stepford Wife.<br/><br/>(3) Homophobia.  Colonel Fitts was a pretty bad character too.  We're supposed to believe that this guy, in his late 40s, has been through an entire career in the Marines without ever facing his homosexuality, even within himself, and that he deals with it by being murderously homophobic, physically and emotionally abusive to his son, and part of some Nazi secret society?  Nice image of gay people too."

The one thing that bothered me the most was the contempt that the film seems to have towards every one of the female characters. They're portrayed as pathetic, shallow and shrill. And even though it wants to, it says nothing about America. At all. It IS watchable, but because it has higher aspirations and fails miserably at attaining them, it is ultimately worthless."

","The first time I saw the film , it gave me a feeling of being a pretentious film that `borrows' a little from ""The Ice Storm"", in its theme of being a film of a dysfunctional family.<br/><br/>The worst part about the film is it leads viewers to think that its the insight of the average American Mid-Life crisis.<br/><br/>I thought the part about the lame red plastic bag floating was `beautiful' , was only a bad pun at how `Beauty' is perceived to be only visually satisfying , as with most of the shots of young , naked actresses.<br/><br/>Teen movies are bad enough but why is an `art' film exploiting Lolita-obsessions ? I thought that the ""Ice Storm"" was more true-to-life in dealing with the topic of sexual awakening among teens. SPOILER ALERT Its black-comedy premise also presented mixed reactions on why the retired Army Colonel would offer himself to Lester Burnham - was he a wife-battering gay too ? Or was he trying to redeem his son and to seek closure on his overly strict upbringing of him.<br/><br/>If a movie doesn't have a specific direction for leading audiences, it will only make a pretentious film and incurring from the movie's title, it is only skin-deep in narrative and beautiful visually."

This film was predictable and boring. Yes, predictable. Anyone who follows politics or popular culture these days can predict how a film character will be portrayed by politically-correct writers, and this film is no exception.<br/><br/>Of course, you can see the upside-down world view of Hollywood depicted here: the most notable to me--since I served with the Marines--was the cartoonish depiction of the retired Marine colonel. He keeps a tight reign on his family, orders pop urine tests, and collects Nazi china. Get the joke folks--the military guy sympathizes with Nazis. (insert laugh track) His wife is a non-entity--a statue. Then naturally the kicker----that he's also a closeted homosexual. The depravity shown is not in the brave men who served for this nation, but of the twisted writer who wrote this rubbish.<br/><br/>And of course, the most normal and happy people on the block were--you guessed it---the homosexual couple. Yay!!! You too could be happy if you were gay!!! What a bloody joke!<br/><br/>I did say above that the script was predictable, and I was right. I just read that the ""writer"" of this film is ""outspokenly gay"". Yeahhhh, I think I figured that one out on my own.<br/><br/>As a side note, I heard some yahoo say that she only went to this film because there was a girl lying on a bed of roses and apparently was expecting something different.

","How good is American Beauty? Well, it depends on how emotionally you enjoy being drained. Also, I feel this movie is massively overrated because the whole disjointed dysfunctional family aspect is way overplayed. I could not take Spacey seriously as a character- why did he start smoking pot and working out, suddenly? Why is the wife unhappy and if they are unhappy than why not get a divorce? Despite 1999 being one of the best year for American Cinema I can't believe this one won all the awards and accolades.

I don't want to give anything away so I'm  just going to give some tidbits. The acting was brilliant. Kevin Spacey was in his best form, I really think this is the perfect role for him. Annette Bening was great, and her hair was even better. I'm not real familiar with Wes Bentley, but his portrayal of Ricky Fitts was spectacular. The direction by Sam Mendes was beautiful. He created such a great feel and vision it's hard to not want to see it again just for the images. I think schools should consider showing this movie to film students to show them how to completely create a mood with such few gimmicks. The mood Mendes created made me laugh and feel uncomfortable at the same time. I guess it was a little bit like the way we all feel about life itself, which is what the movie is about anyway. You must see this movie if you are serious about film, and you should see this movie if you still like to be moved by a brilliant story."
"stryker-5","Null","3","4","26 January 2002"," ""I Know I Didn't Always Feel This ... Sedated.""
","Hmmm ... Let's just take a cool, objective look at a few of the comments made by IMDb users who have reviewed ""American Beauty"". ""Haunting.""  ""Riveting.""  ""Brilliant.""  ""More than meets the eye."" ""Uplifitng.""  ""Never contrived.""  ""By far the best I have ever seen."" ""Makes you think.""  ""Exceptional.""  ""Never gives stereotypes.""  ""Classic masterpiece.""  ""Movies don't get any better than this.""<br/><br/>     And that list is by no means exhaustive.  Now let's contemplate the actual film that these people have been watching.<br/><br/>     Lester Burnham is Suburban Man.  An unremarkable individual not valued by his employer and ignored by his family, he has wasted his entire adult life by succumbing to the routine of work and home, and failing to indulge his own individuality.  When two key events coincide (the loss of his job and the dawning of a 'crush' on his daughter's friend) Lester is suddenly free to ""beat his drum"", slough off years of conformity and be his eccentric self.<br/><br/>     Yes, that's right, yet another dull, cliche-ridden suburban situation comedy hinting at inchoate unease deep in the soul of bourgeois America. All the predictable bases are touched during this smug box-office home run - petty snobbery, keeping up appearances, repressed yearnings for Bali Hi, and that profound American lament, ""I've Never Been To Me"".<br/><br/>     And what does Lester do to express his newfound rebellious individuality?  How exactly does he challenge the suburban world which he has rejected?  Form a witches' coven?  Invent a world language?  Assassinate Castro?  Reproduce indian cave art using bison dung as paint?  No.  He drinks beer in front of the TV set, and gets a job in a hamburger joint. Can America's big-budget Dream Factory come up with nothing more exciting than this?<br/><br/>     Before dealing with the wider themes, I would like to tackle some details which bothered me.  What is a gun doing in this story?  Are Hollywood's screenwriters so bankrupt of ideas that they can't construct a plot without relying on the dreadfully-overworked device of pistol-packing? The opening shower sequence was embarrassing.  Adult jokes are fine by me, bawdy humour is great ... but this was unnecessary and degrading.  It simply didn't belong.  A narrator who announces that he is dead isn't a clever touch, it's just sloppy work.  Is Mena Suvari REALLY the embodiment of American beauty?  I find that hard to believe.  And what about the total loss of nerve surrounding her character?  Isn't this brash film supposed to be proud of its handling of adult issues?  So why does the temptress have to be revealed as a trembling little virgin?  We hear a great deal of American trumpeting of feminism as a cause.  Can't anyone see that this moral cave-in is profoundly anti-feminist?  On a similar note, what was Thora Birch's topless shot all about?  It defines the term 'gratuitous'.<br/><br/>     And so, back to the broader picture.  ""American Beauty"" isn't any of those amazing things that people have claimed it to be.  It isn't even mediocre.  It's a tired, self-satisfied, deeply unimaginative rehashing of a format which was outworn by the time ""My Favourite Martian"" hit the TV screen.  Challenging the regularity of suburban life isn't clever and isn't funny.  It is gut-achingly DULL.<br/><br/>     The question which arises, then, is why so many people are sincerely convinced that ""American Beauty"" outshines ""Citizen Kane"".  I offer this for consideration ... they feel that way because they are told to.  It doesn't work every single time, and sometimes it misses spectacularly, but Hollywood knows that as a general rule, advertising pays dividends.  Tell people often enough that they need to see this mighty film, and they will accept the premises - both that they need to see it, and that it's mighty.<br/><br/>     Barnum said that nobody ever went broke by under-estimating the public. There's truth in that.  Just provide the bread and the circuses, and the docile populace will take you at your word that the bread is delicious and the circuses thrilling.  <br/><br/>     The public wants what the public gets."
"Fortune-2","10","3","4","13 June 1999"," A beautiful movie
","I saw a sneak preview of American Beauty recently and all I can say is that I intend to see it again.  This is a WONDERFUL movie that is worth the money to see in the theaters (the only movie I've been to where half the audience broke into applause during the film).  Kevin Spacey plays Lester, a man who, while going through a mid-life crisis, begins to lust after a teenage friend of his daughter's.  Spacey is, of course, a fabulous actor and really shines in this role.  There are a few interwoven story lines involving Spacey's relationship with his control freak wife (Annette Bening, who is good if a little bit over the top in this role) and daughter, and the family next door, which includes a military general father, a mother who is apparently clinically depressed, and a very interesting son who is obsessed with filming beautiful things (including Lester's daughter Jane).  What is unusual about this movie is that the plot is not unusual or particularly unique--it's a couple of families in an anonymous American suburb and how they relate--but the filming of the movie is absolutely beautiful, and is done in a way that makes the film alternately hilarious, heartbreaking, and horrific.  It is definitely for mature audiences--there is some violence and a couple of frontal nudity scenes (both of which are essential and very tastefully done)--but older teens might enjoy it as well.  Be wary of how the media chooses to portray this movie--it may be called a ""black comedy,"" but, while sometimes hilarious, it is definitely a drama.  Go see it--I don't think you'll be sorry."

The performances held by the actors and actress are incredible, specially Kevin Spacey's and Annette Bening's. They did and excellent work together. It felt as if they shared the spotlight, what I mean with this is that they sort of trade it, at one time you could see how Kevin lets Annette make a wonderful performance and ""viceversa"".

"bsbulldogs","10","4","6","15 December 2014"," Such a beautiful gem of a movie
","I am writing this review for American Beauty after the third time in three weeks that I have watched it and it grows on me each time I watch it. The first time I watched it, I thought maybe this movie is more of a comedy than a drama but after watching it today, I can say this is definitely a drama with some funny moments in it which is what I want from a drama rather than it taking itself too seriously. Kevin Spacey, who is simply brilliant stars as Lester Burnham , a sexually frustrated, average American husband/father who is undergoing a mid-life crisis as he hates his job and his relationships with his wife Carolyn (played superbly by Annette Bening) and daughter Jane (Thora Birch) are strained due to a number of reasons, one being that he becomes attracted to his daughter's best friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari). Add to that, the arrival of their new neighbours, the Fits, Frank (Chris Cooper), Ricky (Wes Bentley) and Barbara (Allison Janney) who seem to have problems of their own. All of these intertwining story lines, acting, music, directing and the script make this movie, in my opinion, an underrated classic of the 1990's which churned out some great movies and what a way to end the decade with a fantastic movie such as this. Hard for me to find a negative with this movie but positives from the movie are the storyline, the beautiful music and score of the movie, directing and of course, the cast of the movie which won the SAG Best Ensemble Award. With the cast, everyone knew their roles in the movie and played them accordingly, Kevin Spacey as the lovable loser, Annette Bening as the ambitious and materialistic wife, Thora Birch as the self esteem-less daughter and in one of her first big roles, Wes Bentley as Ricky, the likable next door neighbour who loves his camcorder and Jane's friend, Chris Cooper as Col Fits, a homophobic, strict disciplinarian father, Allison Janney as the silent wife, Mena Suvari as the egotistical best friend and even Peter Gallagher as Carolyn's real estate rival, Buddy Kane. This film deserved it's Oscar's for Best Picture, Best Director (Sam Mendes), Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography as well as the other nominations including Best Actress-Annette Bening but in saying that, I thought the acting standouts besides the two leads could have been nominated as well including Best Supporting Actress- Thora Birch or Best Supporting Actor- Chris Cooper who put in one of the performances of the year 1999 and has stuck with me ever since or Wes Bentley; either one, take your pick, they were both great."

","They live in the suburbs, therefore they are losers.<br/><br/>That is the sum total of the wisdom imparted by this dreary, pointless and joyless satire of middle-class America, circa 1998. The amazing thing about the film is that the filmmakers (and apparently many in the audience) think this film is bursting with original ideas and deep insights. When in reality, this is a tired retread of antiestablishment cliches from the sixties. The only difference is that films as diverse as DIVORCE AMERICAN STYLE to THE PRESIDENT'S ANALYST to THE GUIDE FOR THE MARRIED MAN to I LOVE YOU, ALICE B. TOKLAS knew how to instill the material with pathos, despair and anger and still show a flair for the wickedly funny and bitingly satirical. AMERICAN BEAUTY is a mean, bitter and shallow examination of people who are mean, bitter and shallow. While those films were daring and fresh, BEAUTY is stale and dirty.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey plays the overworked, under appreciated middle-class corporate drone who drops out of the rat race due to a severe case of the middle-age crazies. Unfortunately, he may be out of the race, but he remains a rat. As played with smarmy snugness by Spacey, the character of Lester Burnham seeks, not inner peace, but self gratification. After resorting to blackmail to get his corporate freedom, he spends his newfound leisure time lusting after his teenaged daughter's cheerleader friend, berating his wife, experimenting with drugs and just generally being obnoxious. Spacey's much praised performance is largely without nuance or heart; a less sympathetic depiction of an ""everyman"" would be hard to come by.<br/><br/>Despite the film's supposed antiestablishment slant and vaguely pro-drugs attitude, the film hardly embraces liberalism. The film is not only antifeminist, but anti-woman as well, portraying Lester's wife (played by the otherwise wonderful Annette Benning) as a shrieking, materialistic shrike. (How dare she find capitalism and the suburbs to her liking!) The other women are mere sex objects. And despite the fact that several of the filmmakers are openly gay, the film is condescendingly homophobic as well: The gay guys next door are used as a joke and when a villain is needed for the finale, out trots the neighborhood closet case.<br/><br/>Good satire says ""This is us, aren't we something!"" Bad satire says ""This is them, aren't they pathetic!"" AMERICAN BEAUTY goes beyond bad satire. The filmmakers make no attempt to conceal their contempt for the American middle class, a group they obviously view with no respect, no sympathy or even a shred of affection. They do, however, seem to respect their moviegoing dollars.<br/><br/>The film's tagline was ""Look closer!"" A bold invitation, considering just how little clothes this emperor is wearing."

","Occasionally, Hollywood makes an independent film. This is my case in point. Saw it again last night and didn't realize how many subjects this film actually deals with. Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning are terrific as a middle class couple with the perfect life on the surface with the demons slowly poking through the bottom of their false exterior. Spacey's mid life crisis is sharp and believable as he attempts to change is life, quiting his job, buying a 70's Pontiac forebode and working out in his garage as his wife cheats on him with a local real estate tycoon. His daughter, played by the now grow up Thora Birch, is at similar odds as she deals with her creepy next door neighbor and her young but sexy friend played by Mira Suavi.

","American Beauty is an exploration of midlife crisis and the illusion of a 'normal' family. Lester Burnham (Spacey), his highly strung wife Carolyn (Bening) and resentful daughter Jane (Birch) each struggle to find a sense of purpose to their lives as the facade of their happy home deteriorates. The story follows Lester on a journey to turn his life around after meeting his daughter's provocative friend Angela (Suvari). His lust for the teenage girl inspires a new lust for youth which he captures by discarding all of adult life's responsibilities in an attempt to re-live his youth. As he quits his respectable job, takes on a position flipping burgers in a fast food joint, and starts smoking pot he finally gets the object of his desire  but was it really what he was looking for? Kevin Spacey's performance as the world-weary and rebellious Burnham is magnificent. The honesty which Lester gives off while everything around him radiates artificiality is astonishingly powerful - aided in no small way by Sam Mendes' use of lighting and colour which is remarkable. Visually, every shot is a work of art, a portrait of discomfort. You can really feel the unease as the camera takes you on a journey through the Burnham household, furbished in blue-greys and white  not so much as a fork out of place - mixed with the stark contrast of red roses. In short, an absolutely breath-taking film, American Beauty is shocking yet humbling, sad yet tranquil and ultimately beautiful."

Instead of building resentments and fueling anger, maybe Hollywood could practice a bit of what it did in its real heyday (the 30's and 40's) and promote the American way of life.  'Cause you know what?  That's what most of us are living........."

""Look closer"" and you'll see the things in peoples' 'stupid little lives' that are disguised by the middle- class American 'commercial'. The respectable dads are in fact self-hating homosexual Nazis, the respectable career-minded wives are unfulfilled materialistic harridans, and their children are smarter-than-thou shallow brats. The only crime is being honest about the phoniness, punishable by expulsion and execution. All it takes is Mendes and his video camera to expose the truth. No wonder liberal Hollywood went gaga."

","The bigger question is, who paid to produce this garbage? Kevin Spacey, what were you thinking? Did they really pay you enough to sacrifice your soul? Although, being moral is a goal sought after by too few today. A movie doesn't have to be 'snow white', so to speak, to be a good movie. Put some of the sick and twisted at the top of my list of favorite movies-Clerks and Four Rooms for example. My reaction is not prudish. This movie made me ill at the first scene, and more so as soon as the premise was established. My biggest fear is that the vast public acceptance of this trash will lead down the slippery slope into even more disgusting and presently taboo subject matter in an attempt to normalize immoral, unethical, illegal behaviors, and dress it up as movie 'art'. I have said it myself, 'I may not know art, but I know trash when I see it'."
"mattrochman","3","6","11","27 April 2008"," Don't be fooled - it is largely cliché and trash
","Ever just wanted to tell you boss where he can shove the job he's given you? Ever wanted to yell at your overly-domesticated wife about her ridiculous artificial life? Ever felt like you can't be buggered with it all you just wanna have fun and ""live it up""? Are you a toe-tag liberal with the view that the world is one giant fake, right-wing, consumerist society with not one shred of purity and genuine happiness? Well I suppose this film is for you then! So why don't I give it a 1 out of 10? To tell you the truth, it's because the film is very clever in the way that it goes about fooling people into believing that this is some sort of deep, artistic, multi-layered critique of modern suburban life with strong messages. In reality, it is riddled with cliché and contrivances, with a touch of absurd humor, but interestingly, it is put together well enough to disguise these major pitfalls. The Hollywood establishment fell for it as well and showered it with Oscars and praise. <br/><br/>Hollywood has a flair for contrived dramas and this was not exception. Take, for instance, the time frame of the story. During this one mystical two or three month period, every member of the family had enormous life-changing encounters / experiences that seemed to click together with other elements of the film a bit too perfectly. The fact that Benning was having an affair and, business-wise, was jumping into bed with the opposition at the same time that her husband (Spacey) was going through a period of liberation from a supposed prison of disenchantment seemed a little too convenient, wouldn't you say? Around this time, their daughter was going through her first serious relationship which coincided neatly with the disintegration of her parent's marriage. The whole setup of the story was as ludicrously contrived as the sidewalks and nature strips on their street.<br/><br/>If that wasn't bad enough, every single last character in this film was as clichéd as they come. Spacey's character was a mid-level exec who finds no meaning in his life or work and does nothing more than has a silly mid-life crisis that is, admittedly, rather humorously scripted in some parts. Then we have Benning who parades all the traits of an unsuccessful, yet ambitious business woman, whose world revolves around matching the cushions with the sofa and pathetic self-motivating tirades. Oh, and of course - despite the fact that she has a moderately stable and semi-functional family, under her strong and happy exterior lies a deeply lost and emotionally unstable individual. Oh please! The daughter has found the man of her dreams and of course, she is going to run away to the big city with him. Lord help us! Take a walk next door and their lies an aggressive, uncompromising, conservative, ex-military father who, of course, is a repressed homosexual. His wife keeps the house in impeccable order and, of course, is sad and lifeless. The son is, of course, rebellious and unpopular, but is full of wisdom and perfect insight. The beautiful girl, the object of Spacey's obsession, is superficially a hard nosed self-superior bitch who, ostensibly, is not afraid to ""sleep"" her way to the top and low and behold, she turns out to be a virgin with insecurities. Blah blah blah dee dah! Aside from such clichés and stereotypes dripping from the characters, they acting is uneven and some aspects were, ironically, very stereotypically ""loud & absurd....& American."" Benning's character seemed totally overblown as did the conservative ex-military neighbor. The actor playing his drug dealing son gave once of Hollywood's most wooden performances and that ridiculous, so-called symbolic, try-hard artistic touch of a bloody plastic bag blowing around in the wind was laughable. Combine the acting with the script and overall, the characters were completely overdone.<br/><br/>Some of the dialog was actually rather good and various parts were admittedly entertaining. But overall, it is an extremely overrated film and, to borrow the tag line, if you ""look closer"" you'll see that contrivance and cliché is the secret ingredient here, but overall it lacks style, sophistication, subtlety and most of all, realism. <br/><br/>When I look closer, all I think is that some people believe what they see and .. well.. others just tend to see what they believe."

","With some of the best writing, characters, and scenes ever put to film, American Beauty is simply a luscious and beautiful movie. It has so much substance in it that you could watch it thousands of times and never get bored.<br/><br/>In all honesty, I wasn't exactly the biggest fan of Kevin Spacey before I saw this movie. My overall opinion on him was that he was a so-so actor that had his good movies and his bad movies. This film changed my mind all together. Spacey's performance is heartbreaking, perfect, and most importantly, realistic. The entire time he is on screen, he literally is just magnificent. Wes Bentley was also captivating to watch, and it's really a wonder that he's not a bigger movie star. His performance in this film was just flawless and incredible. He is quite the scene-stealer, and often outshines some of the other actors.<br/><br/>Overall, American Beauty was a fantastically good film with some of the best writing around. The movie was moving, realistic, and though-provoking; could one really expect any less from the genius Alan Ball, who is also responsible for the amazingness that is Six Feet Under. Don't miss this film under any circumstances, as it is by far one of the most excellent films I have ever seen."
"estringer","10","6","11","16 January 2006"," American Beauty: A Modern Classic
","In many ways, American Beauty claims an obvious spot on the short list of top films because of its litany of recognition, including five academy awards (one Annette Bening overlook shy of the prestigious Silence of the Lambs best picture/director/actor/actress sweep), and overwhelming critical support. However, simple recognition from the film noir crowd does not equate to movie magic (see Donnie Darko, Fargo, or anything by Stanley Kubric). The Academy Awards are also a poor barometer for a film's quality (see Titanic, Shakespeare in Love, or anything by Stanley Kubric). And don't get me started on the Golden Globes. Instead, American Beauty walks the walk.<br/><br/>While movies like The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and Star Wars touch a nerve because they elicit the inner child in us all, low budget, realistic movies without the aid of CGI are more difficult to endear to the common man. As screenwriters like to call it, there must a ""suspended belief"" that the story being told is both relevant and important. These attributes may be obtained in a variety of ways through comedy, drama, and even horror. However, a true classic does not force feed you the ingredients of a well made picture, but slowly mixes them into the batter little by little. This subtly is the crux of American Beauty's genius.<br/><br/>The movie's tag line is ""Look closer."" Anybody who has seen the movie more than once recognizes the value of such a statement. Like the pedals on a rose, the movie's iconic image and foundation for the movie title, the viewer must strip down the flower one layer at a time to get a closer, more relevant look. Screenwriter Alan Ball claims that his motivation for the story was created through his daily life experiences. As viewers, we're convinced he plagiarized from ours.<br/><br/>There is no fabricated demagogue who more than slightly resembles your crazy uncle. Nor is there a conniving thief who would be a millionaire if it weren't for his bone-headed partner. Instead we have an underachieving father who is tip-toeing the ledge of sanity and eternal repression from an overbearing society. Sound familiar? We also have a mother who masks her insecurity with a perfect house, a perfect fence, and a perfect smile. We have a daughter who dreams of breast implants, exchanges her pride for friendship with the conceited but popular girl, and finds love in her outcast neighbor. We have a homophobic ex-marine who demands structure from his son but refuses to acknowledge who he really is. We have the gay neighbors that want nothing more than to be the neighbors, period. Yes, they are stereotypes, but aren't we all? Within each character, we find the Id of the everyday person. What can be more relevant than that? Within the hook of a relevant subject matter, lies an important message. These are not static characters that director Alan Mendes and legendary cinematographer Conrad Hall so expertly introduce. These characters want to be more than who they see in the mirror; however, they volley their intentions and desires from day to day, and sometimes hour to hour. It is through the eyes of Kevin Spacey's character, Lester Burnham, that we see a man who reached the breaking point. His inciting incident is a guilty pleasure that no honest man would care to admit: he fantasizes over his daughter's High School friend. Boom. Motivation to get in shape. It is through this Rudy-esquire bildunsroman that we witness a nobody become a man.<br/><br/>Through Lester's all-bets-are-off attitude, we experience a man stripped to his foundation. He says what he wants to say and does what he wants to do. He hates his job. Solution? Blackmail the boss and get a year's worth of salary, plus benefits. He hates his body. Solution? Smoke pot while he ""wails on (his) pecs."" The viewer is drawn to Lester because he does what we all can't: become who he wants to be. Like in many movies, we live vicariously through the lead character. But Lester is no superman. His actions, although risky and bold, do not require superpowers or extravagant amounts of money. They require a pulse.<br/><br/>Blockbusters like X-Men, Terminator, and Aliens are fine movies. They grab our attention with jaw-dropping special effects, and hold us tight with suspenseful action sequences. But they are not classics. We are not changed, just amused. Likewise, movies like Apocalypse Now, The Wizard of Oz, and Pulp Fiction are well shot, entertaining flicks. But they do not move us, unless you count reaching forward to get more popcorn. It's Rick's goodbye in Casablanca, Michael Corleone's hand being kissed as the new Don in The Godfather, and the way Dr. Hannibal Lector's tongue rattles like a snake in The Silence of the Lambs that change our lives. They strike a chord and let it resonate through our soul. American Beauty sends shock waves.<br/><br/>In a society that justifies postponing a diet for two months by claiming it will be a New Years resolution, it's uncomfortable to see an assertive nobody flip one's life around so suddenly. However, it's equally rewarding and encouraging. Lester Burnham is the underdog who made it to the Final Four. He's the obese woman who finally cracked 200 pounds. He's the recovering drug addict who fought his way to a college degree. And he's the fruition of the desires we fear to embark upon. If you look closer, he's you and me."
"saxman12","10","6","11","15 July 2005"," Pure Genius
","Every so often a movie comes along that totally changes the way people define a good movie. Usually its an action flick, like the Matrix, that uses some new camera work combined with stunning visuals and everyone calls it a masterpiece. This movie, American Beauty, is truly a work of art. Every frame, every line carefully crafted by rookie director Sam Mendes. There are no battle scenes, no technology. It is just a family in suburbia.<br/><br/>This movie should affect everyone who sees it because it is true for us all. American Beauty is actually a social satire of suburban America. These people have an image of what they are ""supposed"" to be implanted in their brains. One day Lester (Kevin Spacey), snaps out of it. Lester realizes there is more out there than a dead end job, a wife who bosses him around and is obsessed with material possessions, but more importantly Lester realizes there is more in him. As Lester starts to change himself, it also affects his environment. His wife Carolyn (Annette Benning) is totally thrown off keel by his actions. Lester has discovered that they are not the average middle class suburban family but a completely unique group of human beings. When he tries to get this message across to Carolyn, she rejects him, has an affair, and convinces herself she is the victim. Lester and Carolyn's message and the main message of the movie is that we all wear masks, put up facades. And unless we become ourselves, we can never truly be happy. It is said multiple times in the film that it would be terrible to be ordinary.<br/><br/>Now, there is a second message. A parallel story is being told. That of Lester's daughter Jane and her boyfriend Ricky. While these two stories are deeply intertwined and connect with each other, Ricky and Jane's message is equally important. Ricky lives in a world of beauty. Beauty is everywhere and in everything. Jane, who at the beginning of the film believes she is ordinary and plain, is brought into this world by Ricky and is shown how much she has to offer. Their message is that there is beauty in everything and all you have to do is look for it.<br/><br/>To make a film of such deep content, it takes a skilled cast and crew to come across as not preachy. Director Sam Mendes (Road to Perdition) has a long and successful career ahead of him. He was able to draw such subtle performances from a magnificent cast and then tie it all together with a tremendous score by Thomas Newman. Alan Ball, another fairly new name, gives a screen play with such audacity, wit, and deeper meaning its almost scary. And of course any review of American Beauty would not be complete without mentioning Kevin Spacey. Before I saw this movie I didn't think it could get much better than his role as Verbal Kint in the Usual Suspects. He was better in American Beauty. This is a tremendous actor in the role of a lifetime. This is one of the finest cinematic achievements I've ever witnessed, and there wasn't one explosion."
"mwhschairjones","9","6","11","5 May 2005"," An excellent film, showing the ""truth"" of the suburbs . . .
","As a high school film teacher, I appreciate the honesty of American BEAUTY. It digs underneath the surface, asking us to ""look deeper."" My students have reflected that this is among the best films this semester, accurately portraying the realities of their lives and the adults in them. The much maligned ""voice over"" works for this ""post-modern"" generation, accustomed to the vagaries of story. Kevin Spacey seems perfect back narrating his life, explaining his own downfall and, ironically, his ""uplift."" Also, the two teenage characters, forced to behave like adults, cast adrift by distracted parents, show the pressures we live under, the pressures to ""fit-in"" and connect with the mainstream culture around us at any and all cost. Great film for students and parents alike . . ."
"dbsx","10","6","11","4 May 2005"," The burgers were good too...
","First of all let me say it's a great movie, although my girlfriend assures me that it's a classic guy flick, nothing more. And it certainly does play on that level. The protagonist goes back to listening to the Who, smoking pot, working in a fast food joint, and lusting after a high school girl. Plus he gets the car that turned him on when he was a teenager. Bonus! Oh, and he dies happy. But more on that later.<br/><br/>This movie also plays (rather shamelessly I thought) to some nicely pointed clichés of the times. Gays are good, the military is bad, stuff like that. Gays are people and so are colonels, and some are good and some are bad, but when making a movie that seeks to draw sharp contrasts between happy and sad it helps to start with good and evil.<br/><br/>There are lots of colors in this movie too. Jim's tie, Jane's room, all those roses. And swirling surrealism. Beautiful.<br/><br/>The colors and the return to hedonism and the joy of plate throwing are what give this movie part of its kick. But here's what it's really about: When the basic physical needs of existence are satisfied, there are basically two ways it can go wrong: Too little love, or too much fear. Family A has too little love. They don't hate each other, the husband wants the best for his wife even when he finds out she's been cheating on him, the wife is horrified to think she has hurt him. But they're alone in the beginning, and the entire course of the movie finds them gaining what they need, some more successfully than others. That's family A. Family B has a different problem: They have too much fear. The wife is catatonic. The husband is at war with the world (hence the military analogy I suppose). The son is finding his way, but that way is filled with manipulation and defense mechanisms.<br/><br/>And then is seen the evolution of those two states. Loneliness joined with beauty breeds fear of the loss of that beauty. Clinging results, beauty cannot flow, and the heart expands to try to hold it all, but it can't expand forever. On the other hand, fear joined with beauty breeds despair, and the heart can be crushed. When Jane takes Ricky's hand she saves him from being crushed. When Lester rediscovers his feelings for Jane and Caroline he is alone no longer.<br/><br/>What is beauty? Beauty is love."
"optimism_always","10","6","11","24 April 2005"," A powerful drama depicting the rotten and unwanted reality which is there anyway however much American society likes living in constant denial.
","There had always been a tradition among the Americans themselves as well as the rest of the world, not without exceptions, of course, to believe in the unity and the firmness of the interrelationships within the typical American family. Before the sixties it had been the privilege of most families on U.S. soil to say that ""The bonds which hold our family units together make us the greatest nation on this planet."" Nevertheless we should not disparage the family values of the rest of the world for our country consists entirely of the indigenous populations of a multitude of states around the globe. We ought to be fair and unbiased when judging ourselves and everyone else, indeed. But as far as fairly judging ourselves is concerned we have come to the point when all our illusions can no longer shield us from the bitter truth. And that is when cinematic masterpieces like 'American Beauty' are born. <br/><br/>The film catches us completely off guard and awakens a kind of nostalgia towards the past of our great country when parents were respected and teenagers' only income stemmed from respectable diligent part-time work and not from the sale of drugs. Back then a high school education was considerably more impressive and its quality was incomparably better than the relative knowledge of a few pages of Shakespeare and a few simple mathematical formulas we have today instead of a thorough and systematic academic programme which United Kingdom for instance has.<br/><br/>As we watch 'American Beauty' we start to panic and think about our own families especially if our children are teenagers. On the screen in front of us we can see the disintegration of two middle-class families not much different from our own in most cases. Some of us begin to take preventive measures soon after leaving the cinema. And that is the way it should be. In fact it's the only way it should be. Therefore movies like 'American Beauty' are a blessing in disguise, even though the rest of the world may experience a feeling of triumph or scorn and even be encouraged to continue to tamper with our security, prosperity and well-being. Bravo. A 10/10."

","American Beauty is loved by the world for the pure reason that it is real. The film shows a real family and the ups and downs that they experience.

What goes on behind closed doors can be quite different to what others see.....<br/><br/>The film follows the life to death of Lester Burnham. A man who facing a mid life crisis who decides to tun his life around, without realising the effect that this will have on the rest in his life.<br/><br/>American Beauty is the debut of Sam Mendes. The way the lives of these ordinary people are portrayed are amazing. Whats clever about it are the hidden meanings that are in the movie. For example, the portrayal of Lester feeling as if he is in prison, done by the shots of Lester always being blocked by something, eg a window or a shower cubicle. His relationship with his daughter leaves you feeling an immense amount of sadness for Lester. The line, ""Hows Jane, hows her life"" just shows how much he doesn't know his daughter and how distant he feels from her. You cant help but cry for him.<br/><br/>A review about American Beauty cant be done without the mention of symbolism. The fact that there is a video camera there sort of represents the connection between life and fiction. Ricky is filming the family as they experience normal life, but to him its not real. The rose petals can represent many things, beauty, anger, love, lust. The fact that they are seen always around Lester and Angela means it probably represents youth and lust. Lester experiences the falling of the petals each time he thinks of Angela as to him she is the only thing beautiful in his life at that moment. Its only at the end he comes to appreciate everything in his life despite the grief it has caused him.<br/><br/>To sum up, American Beauty is one of those films that don't come around too often. As well as entertaining us it gives us the chance to really ""look closer"" at the film and helps us to appreciate life as we know it. As the line at the end states, ""you have no idea what I'm talking about I'm sure, but don't worry, you will someday""........"

","It's 2012 and I've only just watched this film. I'm really only familiar with it because of the video cover I've seen around for years, and probably only watched it because I've been catching up on 90s films I have not seen, or have seen and want to again. In fact, it was only just before I watched it that I realised it had won 5 Oscars, including Best Picture. That last fact had me hardly able to believe my eyes as I saw the tripe unfolding on the screen before me. <br/><br/>This repugnant, puerile piece of garbage actually won Best Picture?? And it has one of the highest ratings on this site?? I live in Australia. Ironically, I visited America the year this film came out. I toured around and visited several friends and their families. None of them came close to the complete losers portrayed here. Spacey is now a man because he's thrown in his job, blackmailed his boss and lusts after a school girl, as well as treating his family like dirt. Benning... well, she was just a complete embarrassment. I mean, seriously! How can anyone watch her and not cringe?? The daughter is the typical moody brat that always appears on screen (we're just told that she's the ""typical teenager"" - shock horror, I've actually met teenagers who are quite level-headed and half-way decent as human beings), and her slutty friend, the object of Spacey's pathetic desires, completes the abject collection of unbearable characters. Oh, there's also the weird, drug-selling boy who loves to watch plastic bags. <br/><br/>This is not good drama; i's unwatchable. It's not good comedy; it's never remotely funny, not in a dark way or any other way it seems to think it is. It's not clever and it's not deep. I've read around this site and see ""American Beauty"" is very much love it or hate it, and I know I'm not alone with my revulsion for this thing. And, from what I've seen, most of the haters seem to be Americans who have taken offense to Hollywood's out-of-touch ideas of the ""typical"" American family. <br/><br/>There are some movies (""The Matrix"" springs to mind) that many adore, but which I can't get a handle on, and yet I respect those who do love it and, eventually watching it again, I could appreciate it somewhat more, and assumed I just haven't been able to ""get"" it. But this thing... what is going on? I thought ""Titanic"" wishing Best Picture was a joke, but that's ""Gone With The Wind"" compared with this appalling piece of junk, and the fact that it is revered by so many is the most repellent part of all."

","Lester Burnham is stuck in a rut - he is having a midlife crisis, alienated from his wife and daughter, sexually frustrated and longing for a feeling that he had as a young man that responsibility robbed him of as an adult. When he meets his daughter's best friend it kicks off a realisation that his life needs to change, starting with quitting his job and acting less responsible.  Meanwhile the lives of both Carolyn and Jane Burnham begin to change in different ways as they also try to deal with the empty days that they seem to live.<br/><br/>When this film came out it jumped almost to the top of the imdb top 250 list - much as many films that make a big audience think or feel something do. Also it gained award after award and was basically held up as a generally great film.  I saw it at the time and was very impressed by it as it touched a nerve in some regards.  Watching it several years later I still am able to take some thinks from it but am more open to the faults that are within it. The actual plot is exaggerated in terms of it not fitting in with the average audience member's experience.  However it's wide wings will mean that it will speak to a large section of it's audience.<br/><br/>The points it has to say are very broad but are delivered in a reasonable manner - i.e. not overly veiled but not rammed down our throats.  I like to think I am a few years off a midlife crisis but I can see my life in Lester's feelings, as many of us can - hence the film's success.  This is not to say that the whole plot is perfect for it is not.  The film is slightly arty and, sadly, a bit pretentious.  I almost dare not say it as I know many audience members were very touched by the `bag scene', but I did think to myself that the film must be very good to be able to carry off a scene that is so full of cheese and pretension!  This happens at several points throughout the film in different ways and does take away from the film somewhat.  Likewise the film's lapse into `whodunit' towards the end doesn't really work either.  Happily the central plot and the classy delivery from director Mendes makes for a great film.<br/><br/>The cast greatly helps and were appropriately rewarded for their work. Spacey may have been in the process of losing his edge by this point in his career (hopefully he'll get back to his best, but he hasn't at the time of writing).  Here he is great and his semi-comic delivery helps smooth out some of the unlikely edges on his character.  Bening is given a lesser role in terms of not being central to the story but her character is actually more emotionally real than Lester - she has to deal with life like the majority of us whereas Lester flees from it.  Birch is good and underplays well while it is nice to see Suvari in a film that isn't average.  Bentley has the least role of the film as his character is the most abstractly drawn and least realistic.  He is OK in the role but he is limited by what he has to work with.  Janney's role is small and one dimensional but her performance is great - it is hard to believe that this is the same woman that plays the super confident and talkative CJ in West Wing!  Cooper is as good as ever and small roles are well done by Gallagher, Bakula and Robards.<br/><br/>Overall this is a very good film but I find it hard to accept that it has been consistently as high up the critics (amateur and professional) lists as it has been.  It has a good plot that has broad enough characters so that most viewers will find something to relate to, but this stretch also opens it up to problems that serve to weaken the film somewhat.  That said, this is still a film that is thoughtful, artistic, character driven and moving - and when a big Hollywood film manages to do that then it is a cause for praise, not complaint."
"Last_Exile","9","5","9","1 May 2008"," Excellent movie that will really stop and make you evaluate your own life.
","American Beauty, released in 1999 and starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari, couldn't be ordinary if it tried. The movie is a deep, wonderful, and penetrating film that will leave the viewer not only questioning their life, but American society as a whole. The movie hits on many key points ranging from conformity in society to individual perception, and really hits home the concept of social disillusionment. The tag line of this movie is ""Look Closer"", which is exactly what American Beauty does with its portrayal of the Burnham and Fitz families. On the surface both families appear to be well-off and happy, but in reality they are struggling greatly with what they want and what they think will make them fit into society. For example, Colonel Fitz on the surface despises homosexuals because he believes that they are not conforming to society's view on marriage, however, in reality he is upset that he cannot break the bonds of social conformism and be gay himself. The truth is, the only happy people in the movie or those who are able to break from society's rules and live their lives according to their own perceptionsunfortunately for most, they reap the consequences society deals to those who are unwilling to bend. Ricky Fitz is sent to a mental institution and ostracized by society because he does not keep the society's view on beauty. And Lester Burnham, though finally able to embrace happiness after waking from his twenty year coma, is killed. American Beauty combines not only great acting and directing, but also includes the audience by asking many questions that will make them stop and evaluate their own lives."
"krumski","2","5","9","18 February 2000"," Come on people - WAKE UP already!! It's no good!!!
","Dreamworks did one hell of a job rolling out the red carpet for this bloated, self-important saga, making everyone feel it was the ""movie to see"" this fall. Well, I don't mind blatant promotion if it points me toward something worthwhile, but this was such a stinker that I walked out in the middle of it (and I NEVER walk out on movies!). I later heard the details of the ending from a friend and could only be doubly grateful that I walked out when I did.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly hollow and grating. I squirmed in embarrassment for Annette Bening, a fine actress forced to embody one of the shrillest and most blatantly misogynistic caricatures of womanhood/motherhood ever put on the screen. Thora Birch as the daughter is evidently the most recent graduate of the Winona Ryder ""sneering and sulking as a form of character delineation"" school of acting. But even she looks like a Meryl Streep next to Mena Suvari as the teenage Lolita of the piece, who is so boring and unappealing that the notion of anyone falling in love with her is absurd. Wes Bentley as the kid next door is just plain weird, like an outcast from a David Lynch movie - which wouldn't be so bad except that we're supposed to take him seriously. Chris Cooper as his militaristic and overbearing father does his best with the role, but it's every bit as obvious (and odious) a caricature as Bening's. <br/><br/>The only actor who comes out looking even halfway decent is Kevin Spacey - not because he's so wonderful, but simply because he has the good sense to underplay his part and search for the laughs wherever he can find them. Indeed, when he's being drolly amusing, the movie is passably entertaining (like in the scene where he tells off his boss, or when he applies for work at a fast-food restaurant). But he gets zero support from the rest of the cast, and so even his talents are wasted, as there's just no one believable for him to play off of.  And even his humor is wasted, since the film, instead of being a black comedy (which might - emphasize MIGHT - have worked), so wants to be taken seriously as an Important Statement. But since everything in it is either a cliché or a stereotype, how can it be taken seriously?<br/><br/>And it's so derivative! It's like the producers said, ""Ok, let's cross The Ice Storm with Lolita and The Truman Show, throw in bits and pieces from Fearless and War of the Roses, some of the feel of The Graduate, and give the whole thing a look straight out of Blue Velvet."" It's ridiculous! Every situation and idea in here has been done far better somewhere else - heck, any run of the mill made for TV family crisis melodrama is better than this schlock. I can't emphasize this enough: THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE! An insult to all mature, thinking and feeling people.<br/><br/>What's WRONG with all of you out there?! Snap out of it! Seeing the reception this film has been getting, I feel like I'm in Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and I'm the last one who has not been taken over by the pods. And you know what? It's starting to get lonely."

","I feel sad for people who see ""depth"" in this flick. The only thing that lurks below the surface of American Beauty is hate... skillet-deep, self-indulgent HATE. Similarly, the film does nothing to show what ""looking closer"" (its mantra) does for anyone aside from turning them into pitiful/pitiless scumbags. Example: after their epiphany with the paper/trash and Spacey's death, the two kids look coldly at the dead father and then turn to trash the cheerleader on their way out the door. What sort of humanity or beauty is there in this? Suvari turns out to be the only humane character in the flick, and these two droids tell her SHE'S got problems/is essentially trash? Please. If you listen to the director's comments, you hear that their actions are supposed to be the closing of a circle of sorts. I.e. The boy again sees beauty in an unlikely place. Again, please. The kids are vampires, sucking on beauty with no intention or ability to pass it on, much less radiate it. This is only one example of the utter lack of depth and humanity of American Beauty.

There was much more going on than I expected and all the story lines were interesting in their own way. <br/><br/>The plot goes much deeper than I imagined and it really is just a brilliant drama. It also has its comedy moments which help the film to flow. The cast in this all delivered very strong performances and made it seem so real, especially Kevin Spacey.

","This movie is fantastic. Sure this movie has fantastic acting and directing and music and all that jazz, but it also possesses unique qualities that typically are only found in Indies. This rare gem (not using the cliché lightly) combines the great standard aspects found in a blockbuster with the profound feelings found in a good independent film. <br/><br/>It's quite philosophical. Mainstream movies tend to not rely on ""deep"" thinking like riskier movies do. I know people like to say ""If you enjoy philosophizing, you'll LOVE this movie!"" about their favorite films, but I believe in this case it's true. I left the movie with a deep sense of enlightenment. I admit I bought into it harder than I believe the average person would (I believe due to a great cynicism of society.) I wouldn't call American Beauty ground-breaking, but it did shake me somewhat.<br/><br/>It drives home its main idea without being preachy, which is pretty hard to do. It starts subtle and keeps growing to the end.<br/><br/>American Beauty also has some roots in forests Hollywood doesn't tend to grow it, another nice fruit. As liberal as I feel I am, I (embarrassingly) admit I felt a little uneasy about some elements of the movie. But I view that as a good thing.<br/><br/>I think the main reason people might dislike this film is because of its corny aspects. American Beauty does have a couple cheesy elements, but most of them are purposely cheesy. But I admit American Beauty does fall victim to two too noticeable slapstick-like instances that seem out of place because the rest of the movie is so good. I was so enthralled by the movie that when these gimmicks happened I was pretty upset. It's not as though other popular movies wouldn't have these occurrence, it's that while watching this movie seems too good to have them. I got the feeling that, in one of the scenes, the director kept re-shooting the scene and telling Spacey to be MORE obvious. But I can't stress enough that I felt this way in literally two scenes. <br/><br/>This is definitively a lasting film. I watched 13 years after it was released and loved it. Even though it's not totally exactly perfect, I gave it a 10/10 because of rounding errors.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie."

","American Beauty shows the contrast between the two faces of America.<br/><br/>American Beauty extends the idea that nothing is ever perfect.

At the begging of the film she is unhappy with her body while she is looking at best augmentation on the Internet before school. Jane's appearance is a dark gloomy feel, but as the film progresses and Jane has a relationship Ricky Fits. Jane becomes progressively better looking and more appealing to the audience. She becomes an almost natural beauty in the film much more so than Angela who everyone thinks is a goddess. The real message of the movie is that there is no such thing as beauty, but everyone espiers to be beautiful. In the very begging of the film there is a shot of a rose. As you might know a rose looks beautiful but it does have thorns beneath it just like all of the characters in American Beauty they all have something to hide.<br/><br/>American Beauty shows the shady underside of suburban life, or having a mysterious neighbor and a not so perfect marriage. It gets the message across that nothing is ever perfect and there is no such thing as beauty."

","I view the characters in this film much as I view the characters in John Steinbeck's 'Of Mice and Men'. Each character in the book has their dreams, their goals, whether simple or fancy, they are dreams and most of them know deep down that they will never get there, but in order to lift themselves from the reality they are in, they need something to look forward to. In each character is a desire to be somewhere else, and in each character there is a major flaw, a weakness. In creating characters like these, Steinbeck has given each character redeeming features in such a way, that however hard you try, you cannot pick out a villain. Each and every character is a 'good guy', but each has their flaws that lead them to tragedy, and that is an excellent dynamic. <br/><br/>In American Beauty, Lester, Janie, Angela, Carolyn, Ricky and Frank are all made out to be bad guys in some way or other, but each have their dreams, each have their flaws and they are all led to tragedy in one way or another because of them. Oh, and each are 'ordinary'. Its this Characterisation that really makes the film, aside from the cracking cinematography, acting, direction and ball-busting script.

Believe or not, most suburban fathers do NOT lust after their teenage daughter's friends, do NOT try to blackmail their employers, do NOT obtain drugs from the youth next door, and do NOT quit decent jobs to flip hamburgers and ride around in sport cars. Another amazing fact is that most suburban mothers do NOT cheat, or cart their lovers around in their SUVs for a quick bite to eat after having wild sex at the local motel. You'll probably be surprised to learn that the vast majority of suburban daughters are NOT plotting to kill their fathers, that they do NOT expose themselves for the camera of a voyeuristic ""boy-next-door"", or that their friends do NOT try to seduce their fathers with the skill of a street hooker. I also daresay that the ""welcome wagon"" is NOT likely to be led by a local gay couple, and I wouldn't be too concerned about the macho military man next door letting loose with his repressed homosexual tendencies and kissing his male neighbor. And last but not least, most suburban fathers need NOT worry about someone sneaking into their homes and blasting them to eternity.

"sol-","Null","5","10","26 April 2005"," My extended review of the film
","'American Beauty' is a film about people and how they live. At times it is a biting satire with sharp wit and acute observations, at other times it is a deep drama about unhappy individuals in American suburbia, but all the time I found it an enjoyable film to view, both because of the things it has to say and the high cinematic quality of the production. <br/><br/>The best part of the film would probably be Alan Ball's original screenplay. It is alternates from amusing and touching, perceptive and funny, and the characters are all very well developed and feel real. A common complaint I hear about the film is that the characters are thin, but they are just the opposite. We acquire an understanding of what makes each character tick and what each characters wants out of life. Some are motivated by the idea of success and luxuries, while other are prepared to settle for a simpler lifestyle. Some of the characters also have their own individual secrets that are revealed towards the end, and by watching the film again one can pick up their insecurities about their secrets.<br/><br/>Another complaint I often hear is that the film is too literal and straightforward. This however is quite a subjective judgment, as where does one draw the line between a film being too complex and not complex enough? If a film is overly complex and too hard to extract meaning out of, sure some people would look deeper, but others will be put off. I feel that 'American Beauty' has quite a good balance between how much it blatantly states and how much you can extract by closer examination, and what is said out loud is not unnatural. It is in that way a film that can be enjoyed by almost all people: casual moviegoers and avid film buffs alike.<br/><br/>There is not really much else that people tend to complain about, and really there is hardly anything at all to not like. The types of flaws that one might find in the film are what you expect to find if judging whether one of two films in an all time top 100 list is the better of the two. They are not the type of flaws that should affect one's viewing experience, unless of course one expected to find something more in the film than it offered. But that again is subjective.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of the film are wonderful. Thomas Newman's score is very low-key and simple when needed, and more zapped when required. Conrad L. Hall has meticulously set up every single shot. His use of out-of-focus backgrounds and foregrounds, high and low camera angels, and swooping shot is perfect. The film all flows very well, and some jump cut editing is perfectly woven in. The set décor and art direction paint a colourful picture of suburbia but yet they also manage to bring out the monotony of all the individual places. Plus the use of the colour red in the film basically speaks for itself.<br/><br/>To compliment the film's other virtues, the cast give it their best with good results. Each actor and actress perfectly suits their characters, and it a shame about the lack of acclaim given to many of the performances. Spacey and Bening do some brilliant stuff as a discontent couple who are learning individually to enjoy life but yet are still full of anger, and Birch is perfect as their insecure teenage daughter. But the often unmentioned great performances come from Chris Cooper as the army type new neighbour, Wes Bentley as his teenage son, and Alison Janney as his wife, who seems just a little too detached from life. Then of course there is Mena Suvari as Birch's school friend who values her looks above everything.<br/><br/>This is a film that touches on many different human concerns. Beauty, as in the title, is a key theme, and ideas about different perceptions of beauty run throughout the film. Bentley films a number of sequences on his camcorder, and we are shown the digital pictures. There are also the windows that everyone uses to spy on one another. People see things in many different ways because we are all different, yet we are all striving for a common goal of contentment, and the film tries to show this. 'American Beauty' starts off as a mystery thriller because we know that Spacey has died and that Birch has asked someone to kill him, but the mystery is the end is how we all function and how we are able to find happiness in life."

","Lured by rave reviews and a sexy ad campaign, I was nevertheless expecting not a whole lot from this Big Hollywood tragi-comedic look at a dysfunctional, upper-middle-class suburban family.  I mean, you've got the mild-mannered guy-in-a-suit who's going through a mid-life crisis (Kevin Spacey), the materialistic wife (Annette Benning), the snarling, goth teenage daughter, the sexy blonde cheerleader--stereotypes all, or at least they would have been stereotypes in the hands of a less capable director, screenwriter and cast.  But here, they're modern archetypes. If there had been nothing else to this movie, I would have been amazed and gratified simply on account of the skillful navigation of the fine line between caricature and character.  For instance, I would normally roll my eyes at the simplistic cliche and cheesy humor of a scene where the shallow, materialistic wife pours cold water on an abortive love-making session because she's afraid her husband will spill beer on her $4,000 couch with its Italian fabric.  But here, it makes sense, and the characters' motivations and interactions are believable, and it's even a little sad. And there's the arrogant, vain cheerleader:  In most movies you're expected to despise her without qualification, but here you get a few subtle hints of her underlying isolation and vulnerability that make sympathy possible, in spite of the fact that her character remains basically a prop.  All the characters, lead and supporting, morally ambiguous as well as evil, come out looking human.  While I wish Hollywood could make more movies about ""normal"" people, instead of the privileged suburbanites it identifies most with (maybe American Beauty could have transcended mere excellence and attained immortality if it had been about, say, an auto lube technician married to a receptionist), it seems that the film-makers have deliberately chosen the familiar milieu of a critique of the American Dream to serve as a vehicle for a broader message.  Spacey's family has the big house, the picket fence, the mini-van--but they don't have happiness.  That's the cliche, but this film rises up from 30 or 40 years of cynical cinematic commentary on the soulless emptiness of bourgeois family life to tell us that there is life beyond disillusionment, beyond (and within) the inevitable ugliness around us, and that it has been there all along. It does so in a way that isn't heart-warming in the way we're accustomed to (it has dispensed with sentimentality as well as cynicism, as they are two sides of a coin), but it is hardly cold, and it is touching and thought-provoking."

Instead, the story's just a male midlife-crisis fantasy (""my only problem is my annoying wife""), and the characters are cliched caricatures who only manage to irritate the viewer.  (Maybe the simplistic male theme and perspective explain the one-dimensional female protagonists?)  The movie tries to hide its thin plot and dull characters behind the cheap expedient of disconnectedly breaking a few ""taboos"" here and there -- masturbation, nudity, voyeurism, drugs and paedophilia, in no particular order.  So what!  Shocking?  Titillating?  No: simply boring.  I cannot fathom why critics would detect originality in this loser of a movie. In fact, I think it's an interesting social commentary that apparently many viewers find profundity in this movie, and identify with its dull, dull, dull characters.

Of those three the only one that looks down on the viewer like the movie is above them is American beauty. It is really annoying that the catch phrase is look closer when the movie is not deep or well thought out.<br/><br/>Main character is a regular guy who decides to change his life. This messes up everyone else's life. So he does one rebellious thing after the other and in the end, due to a sitcom like situation, in which he appears to be doing something he's not, he ends up dead. That's not a spoiler, the narration tells you that at the beginning of the movie. What message are you trying to get across when the main characters life change kills him. Don't change or die changing? The movie doesn't make it clear because a lot of things in this movie are left ambiguous and general so that it can seem to be smart.<br/><br/>The last line of the movie conveys a message that you don't get the movie but some day you will. Bite me. Why release the movie then? Everything is pretentious and trys to seem meaningful in American Beauty.<br/><br/>The movie has average cinematography. This bothers me because of how the movie keeps trying to say everything is beautiful. That is another example of how the movie trys to be above everyone. Violent or odd acts are happening and everything is beautiful. Like the movie is trying to have a message about that but doesn't have a strong opinion.<br/><br/>Fight Club and Office Space did a much better job of saying ""take control of your life"" and Feris Buelers Day Off said ""life moves fast you should slow down and look at it sometimes"". I hate American Beauty for saying someday you will understand the point and being general so that it leaves the impression of saying something without saying anything."

As craven as it is confused, the contempt that it displays towards its characters and subject matter suggests that it is the product of those whose knowledge of film (and life)doesn't go much beyond the Nineties. Reveling in the trendy cynicism of our times and dismissive of anything that resembles two-dimensional characters, it is depressing to see such an otherwise outstanding cast utterly wasted here (Kevin Spacey, Chris Cooper, and especially Annette Benning in acting so hysterical as to make Al Pacino's work in ""Scent of a Woman"" a model in nuance and subtlety.) Scattered are scenes of some promise, industrially the technical work is competent, and the teenage performances are fine. It is the director who must take the blame, a man too young to have any conception of a midlife crisis, too English to understand American suburban life, and too new to art to understand that, as Andrew Sarris says, ""it is cynicism, and not idealism, that is generally the mark of youthful immaturity, or rather it is the cynic who is generally the most foolish romantic."""

","I know I'm a little outnumbered here, but this is one of the most boring and overrated films I have ever seen. This is the winner of Best Picture, along with being said that it is one of the best movies of all time? How exactly is this possible?<br/><br/>When I had seen the trailer for American Beauty, I immediately wanted to see the film. I'm the kind of person who waits for the movie to come out on video, so I can view it at my own speed because I usually like to watch parts of it more than once to get the full understanding of them. I had heard so much about the movie, and after it racked up the Oscars, I was forced to rent it. I did and boy, was I ever disappointed.<br/><br/>What is so great about it? So it's a tale about a man who is unhappy with his life and decides to change it in many ways. My life isn't exactly the most perfect, and at times, I too would like to change something about it. Everybody probably does. If I wrote my thoughts down on paper along with some characters and intelligent writing, do you think that I could sell it to a production company?<br/><br/>Let's discuss this movie in sections. The actors did a well job with the parts they were given. I'll admit that Kevin Spacey portrayed Lester Burnham in an excellent way and deserved the Oscar that he earned. Annette Bening made a disaster of her character, Carolyn. I thought that in every scene she was in, she tried to steal the show. Her character's story and problems were kind of bland if you compare them to Lester's. I was so glad to see that the Best Actress award didn't go to Annette for her ridiculous role. Thora Birch, who I have always liked, did a very good but not terrific job as Jane Burnham. Her character is complex and that was about the only thing I liked about this film. It does a pretty good job of describing what a teenager is like. The stuck-up Angela Hayes, played by Mena Suvari was the worst part of American Beauty. All I wanted to do was slap her, which was good because the character really spoke to the audience. I didn't like anything about the lines or actions she said/did. Wes Bentley was all-right but I didn't like his character and thought that the movie would have been a lot better off without his story line. I realize that it would have left out a ton of significant situations and plots to each character, but I don't know, it really didn't fit into the Burnham's problems.<br/><br/>Why was the plot and main idea given such rave reviews? Hard times after another came for the always depressed and suffering Lester Burnham. Yeah, yeah, the poor guy realizes that his life is pathetic and then his wife and daughter also have some problems. ALMOST everybody goes through mid-life crisis, but for some reason, this guy really stood out. Why?<br/><br/>The different problems that the characters go through are quite interesting, yet very odd. Carolyn's affair, Jane's encounter with the boy next door, Lester's obsession with Angela, smoking pot, working out, etc., etc., etc., were all amusing and entertaining to watch. <br/><br/>Perhaps, the thing I liked most about American Beauty was the conclusion. The whiplash ending happened fast and probably caught everybody else off guard. Finally, American Beauty was put to rest. (Well in my house anyways.)"

","Sam Mendes' entire film career has consisted of woefully misguided attempts to dissect the many ills of American culture without remotely understanding them. Perhaps he should spend some time slinging his arrows at Britain's problems before jumping across the pond.<br/><br/>""American Beauty"" is a movie about American suburban malaise set in a version of suburban America that simply doesn't exist. Its characters are either gross and grotesque caricatures or mere vessels for regurgitating Alan Ball's pretentious screenplay, forced to utter lines that never sound like things people would actually say. Kevin Spacey gives the consummate Spacey performance -- one-note snideness delivered in a sardonic monotone -- that he gives every time he's in front of a camera, while poor Annette Bening is unwatchable in a frenzied performance that I have to believe was forced on her by the director, since she's never again been as bad, either before or since. The worst of the film's dialogue is reserved for all of the angst-filled teenagers, and most conspicuously for Wes Bentley, a tortured and philosophic youth who reads a ridiculous soliloquy about the beauty to be found in a plastic bag as if he's reciting Shakespeare.<br/><br/>The film has a weird preoccupation with homosexuality that doesn't really fit and makes itself most manifest in the character of Chris Cooper, a closeted ex-serviceman who, true to the film's form, is depicted as a goulish representative of conservative America.<br/><br/>What is the point you ask of all this glib satire?

This movie was supposed to be looking underneath the surfaces to discover inner beauty. Unfortunately, this is accomplished with such a stunning lack of subtlety that it's shockingly disconcerting. The ""beauty"" is presented by the means of being insultingly obvious and forced, and by giving both teen actresses topless scenes. So we have this: a high-minded philosophical-wannabe movie, which succeeds only as a mediocre softcore flick."

We  have the dissatisfied suburban man, his rebellious teenage daughter, the cold  wife, the latent-homosexual...every one of these characters has been in at least  ten movies before it, in some variation or another.  About the subject of Lester's  supposed quest for a new life: I don't think it's remarkable that he decided to just  chuck it all and revert to an adolescent mindset. I see it as incredibly immature.  And, I'm sorry, but I don't see the beauty in a plastic bag blowing around in the  wind or, for that matter, a dead bird, a dead vagrant or a dead Lester. What is  beautiful about the sight of a man whose head has been blown off? Now, I said  earlier that the only part of the movie I liked was Lester's final monologue. I felt it  was the only part of the movie where we got to see Lester for who he truly was, not the person he pretended to be throughout the movie.

Although I will admit to finding the film's performances impressive, I make no apologies for saying that Kevin Spacey did not deserve to win best actor by a longshot. Both Denzel Washington and (especially) Richard Farnsworth gave performances of far greater depth and difficulty, and I can only thank the rising sun in the East that Anette Benning did not garner a best actress nod for her performance.<br/><br/>Everyone talks about how ""deep"" and ""profound"" this film was in exploring the hollowness of American materialism, but in truth all themes covered in this picture have been explored time and time again.

","Sam Mendes's masterpiece still shines two decades later, showing why its Best Picture win at the 2000 Oscars is still very much deserved. Kevin Spacey stars as a middle-aged advertising executive who experiences a mid-life crisis when he pulls a ""Lolita"" and becomes obsessed with his teenage daughter's best friend, played by Mena Suvari. The film experiences themes such as the mirage of American suburban exceptionalism, beauty, and sexuality.<br/><br/>Mendes forces the audience to look at the sad marriage Kevin Spacey's character, and his wife, played by Annette Bening, experience by looking at it in a sort of forced conformity. Both characters feel like they're in a prison, not free to make their own choices while they accuse the other of controlling them, resulting in a toxic relationship that soon spirals out of control. Yet no matter what themes we explore, the film seems to transcend critique by refusing to be seen through only one interpretation, hence the fascination audiences and critics everywhere have for this film. Such a characteristic is one of the many reasons why this is still one of the greatest dramas of all time.<br/><br/>The acting, writing, cinematography, and editing are all excellent, and Spacey, although now tarnished following recent news about the actor's terrible choices in his personal life, delivers a performance in which you can sense the pathetic and shameful feeling that his character, Lester Burnham, has about everything: his job, his marriage, his sex life, etc. The exploration of the American middle-class, and the film's interpretation of it as a metaphor for conforming to a normal boring life, serves as an echo to other films in 1999 that explore similar themes: Magnolia and Fight Club, to name a few. The film remains one of my personal favorites and a staunch reminder of the reality of our own conformity and the prison it comes with if we do not strive to become unique."

","American Beauty (DreamWorks, 2000, USA), Sam Mendes's directorial debut. It's a dark comedy centered around Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), a middle-aged turd who lost the zest for life, but sets out to get his mojo back in his last year alive.<br/><br/>Dissatisfied with his real estate broker wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and emo teen daughter Jane (Thora Birch), Lester's lost until he eavesdrops and hears Jane's BFF Angela (Mena Suvari) claim she'd totally do him if he just got buff.<br/><br/>Carolyn is also lost. She's a snooty workaholic, captive to material things and her ideal of success. Her desperation for this success is probably the main thing keeping it at bay. She can hardly contain her frustration when people don't buy the house she's selling.<br/><br/>Jane is a cheerleader who falls in love with a voyeuristic loner Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley). Ricky just moved in next door with his abusive, dementedly homophobic, ""order and discipline"" Marine Colonel dad (Chris Cooper), and his mom (Allison Janney), a meek, horribly unloved, perhaps dim-witted woman.<br/><br/>The married characters are set up so far apart from each other, it's hard to believe they ever got along. At one point, Lester even asks Carolyn ""what changed?"" Most of the time nobody listens, in the last dinner table scene Lester breaks the asparagus against the wall and deadpans ""honey, please don't interrupt me."" Lester and Carolyn are both jerks, and still I was tricked into liking them anyway, Spacey and Bening have that kind of skill.<br/><br/>Carolyn and Lester's relationship is where the commentary about materialism takes place. Carolyn Burnham actually gets the short end of the stick here. She's really trying to uphold her standards. Her problem with Lester is his apathy, he's stopped believing in any rules and standards. Lester talks a lot about being owned by stuff, but Carolyn's views aren't expressed very well. She comes across as a prude scold until her affair with real estate rival Buddy ""the King"" Kane (Peter Gallagher), just about the only good thing that happens to her in the whole movie. Only then do we get to see that she can have fun too (""yes, your majesty!"").<br/><br/>Some reviewers have stated that Lester's ""this is just stuff"" speech is invalidated because he trades in his sedan for a red sports car. I'm not sure. I doubt he'd allow the thought of messing up the upholstery stop him from getting it on in the car. But he clings to the beer and decides to argue. His point is right, don't let possessions stop you from living a little. Regardless, Lester should just shut up and move his wife somewhere she wants to do it. Instead he yells at her, now they're both unsatisfied.<br/><br/>Lester is an emotional roller coaster, starting out desperate, loathsome and contemptuous. He meets Angela and gets pathetically horny and sycophantic. He's angry at the world, vengeful and vindictive. Lester gets smug and rebellious, reverting to adolescence. He's completely self-centered during this journey. His silly rose petal fantasies invigorate him, but still all he does is anger people, smoke weed and flip burgers.<br/><br/>At the climax, he sees Angela for what she is and he understands who he needs to be. His lust for this girl transforms into a lust for life. He asks about others with genuine concern. He makes Angela a sandwich, asks about his daughter. Spacey's transformation is night and day. His arc represents the idea that death and wisdom go together. The smile Lester gives when he learns his daughter's happy and in love might've sealed the Oscar for him.<br/><br/>Colonel and Mrs. Fits don't talk. Mendes will show them right next to each other on the sofa but a world apart. Colonel Fits pours his energy into watching Ricky, who's dealing drugs right under his nose. The Colonel has a hair-trigger temper, showing a lack of the discipline he tries to beat into Ricky. It'll cause you to wonder how this guy made it so far up the chain of command, colonels report to generals. So many problems come from this guy's prying and spying.<br/><br/>Mrs. Fits maintains an empty glare, with big old sad eyes. She's subservient, and her needs have been neglected for years. She probably just wonders what can she do for her husband's love? I doubt she says more than 20 words the entire movie, but they reveal her defective selflessness and her feeling of unworthiness.<br/><br/>A lot's been made about the stereotypical characters and plot line. The writer (Alan Ball) and director were apparently aware these roles are almost like caricatures and the actors play along. Almost everyone is over the top delusional until a moment of truth, which gives clearer insights into the characters. The only people who don't seem delusional are Ricky and Jane, but Ricky's riffs on beauty are a little sentimental, and his response to seeing Lester at the end just seems disconnected from reality. Then again nobody's reaction in that last scene makes any sense.<br/><br/>We're told to ""Look Closer,"" to see through the facades people desperately uphold. Sam Mendes directs with impeccable framing and staging of his shots, especially when he introduces the characters. Mendes artfully shows us the trouble with the people and relationships being portrayed. These portraits feature still or very slowly moving shots that allow characters' postures and expressions to reveal some truth.<br/><br/>Mendes clues us in to the tensions between facade and reality. Granted, the two Jims and the real estate ""king"" aren't exactly multilayered, so some stereotypes aren't subverted or redeemed. These characters are justifiable because they're necessary and instrumental in helping us to know the core characters. American Beauty is not concerned with kind, well adjusted, virtuous people. Lacking minorities, it provides flavor by showing middle class people faking it alone, together. It's a very good movie with a clear viewpoint. Go see it."

Is this one big ironic joke? I looked closer but I could see no discernible method or meaning through the orgiastic mirage of clichéd to death characters and annoying dialog. No, I declare, there is no beauty here!<br/><br/>I can see there is something in this film that will appeal to some people, however I was not the least bit impressed by this tasteless and pathetic excuse for satire. The acting is pretty decent but the characters are all highly irritating and idiotic clichés that represent some of the worst aspects of modern society. Granted It sometimes looks pretty good but the plot is trashy, predictable, nasty and inane, like the plastic bag. I know I will be told to 'look closer' but no thanks. I could take a dump and watch it float around and ponder how it reflects on life instead. I would probably come to the conclusion that it accurately depicts how in cinema s**t always seems to float, especially at the Academy Awards, now isn't that beautiful?<br/><br/>Well I understand that American Beauty is supposedly a satire on the plastic image of American suburbia and the petty, 'silly little lives' of it's residents, great, nothing new there. If your going to do satire that does not mean you just throw in every cliché in the book and poke fun at it. This was just PREDICTABLE and unoriginal, I wanted it to be challenging and do something new, but no it just forced us to sit through the ever increasing silliness of Lester's mid life crisis and did not try to challenge any of the issues unless they were easily resolved with a clichéd or ridiculous situation. Wow, so a sad old man is rebelling, are we supposed to feel uplifted by this, are we supposed to be endeared to this 'every man'? OMG he just quit his crappy high paid job, whoopee! Now he's smoking dope, hurray what a hero! Now he is lusting after a teenage girl, man this guy is the best! How original, how fun and 'shocking', this is entertainment at it's best, or so we are lead to believe. This film is sickeningly crude. Crude can be effective as long as it is done right but when your not sure what the film is trying to achieve it's not a good thing, I was not sure if this film was trying to be funny or deadly serious and profound, it was neither in the end, to me anyway. I did at least have some fun playing an unexpected game of 'guess the cliché' every time a new character was introduced, hmmm a geeky teenage boy, let me guess - he smokes dope, hates his parents and looks for poetic meaning in inane things? - correct, hurrah! I just don't understand how/why this silly film is so loved. I mean what were the intentions here? At least other trashy films have clear intentions, but where are American Beauty's?<br/><br/>That plastic bag bit is perhaps the most stupid and annoying thing I have ever seen in a film ever. I know this sequence is supposed to illustrate that beauty is in the eye of the beholder etc and this is supposed to relate to the film (somehow) blah, blah, blah but really I don't care, and that dork was just plain shallow, and annoying so it defeated the purpose! The same goes for the whole film really, if the last 10 minutes was some sort of (extremely amateurish) attempt at redemption then it had much the same effect as the bag scene, it was invalidated by everything else around it. Was Lester's sudden moment of clarity (as alcoholics would call it) and the last sequence supposed to be beautiful and poetic? The question I ask is, why make us sit through 2 hours of nonsense without challenging anything of importance and then try to turn it all on it's head and sum it all up in 10 minutes? Is this meant to reflect life itself? If that's the case then fine, but heck was it sloppily written and executed. I assume that it's all about looking for beauty, and the rest of the film concentrated on the crude, rebellious behavior of Lester to try and make us realize that, in the end, there was a person of beauty and emotion trying to break through that petty, immature facade, if we 'look closer', and this idea can be applied to life itself. Even if that is the (yawnsome) case they could have told us much sooner! I don't find it fun to sit for 2 hours and try to look behind some tiresome, poorly conceived clichéd characters and horrendous displays of bad screen writing in search of some humanity and meaning then have it thrown at me in the last 10 minutes, after I had stopped caring. Sorry but this film is just a prime example of poor plot construction and script writing. I was actually left amazed by how little this movie affected me despite so obviously attempting to do something of the sort, I felt nothing (apart from mild anger), perhaps this was the ultimate irony that Mendes and Ball were looking to achieve. They wanted to desensitize me, like society is trying to do. Oh the horror! Anyway, films like this are old news nowadays and like extreme feminism and reality T.V many folk are now finally becoming tired of such trash, this film will be more or less forgotten in 5 years, I bet you! American Beauty is in the eye of the beholder though, but I don't want it in my eyes ever again thank you very much. 2 stars for acting, 1 for cinematography, 0 for everything else = 3 stars."

","I loved this movie.I have had this mad crush on Kevin Spacey since I first saw it.I have probably seen it at least 10 times. The relationship that he and Mena Suvari have is so (out there).It reminded me of my own (pre) mature thoughts about older men ,when I was younger. I really liked the oddness of it all.There were so many twists and turns that you did not know what to expect until they happened.It was uplifting to see Lester get his independence.He made it all so worth it. For those of you that have never seen the TV movie ""Homeless to Harvard"" with Thora Birch you are missing a really good performance. American Beauty is by far one of my favorite top 10 movies of all time.<br/><br/>Becky Brown , Fort Worth Texas"
"cbernhoft153","10","3","5","25 May 2005"," A Film Class Favorite
","My new favorite movie! I would never have watched this movie outside of my high school Film Studies class. But the first two minutes of the film seemed to have got my attention. I felt that the tone of the movie was really interesting. Most of the film was quiet and wasn't action packed like most movies that typical high schooler's watch. In the beginning, the movie was really mellow and then slowly the intensity started to build up. The thing that helped make the movie so great was the music. It's a type of music I can't explain. It gave the movie that certain tone that it has.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie were great! And if Lester was played by someone other than Kevin Spacey, the film would not be as good. I love Lester Burnham, he's so laid back, he doesn't really get angry at all. He only loses his temper one time in the movie and I found it hilarious because it was so random.<br/><br/>It's just a great movie, you have to watch it! <br/><br/>Best quote- ""Would someone pass me the *&%^(#$ Asparagus!"""
"B2theRandon","9","3","5","19 May 2005"," Picture Perfect
","Sam Mendes does a great job showing the troubles and problems a teenager might go through during their high school career. I'd have to say that this movie was more based around the father's life and his problems with it. Mendes really portrays well what a troubled father ready to give it all up might do to get things to go his way. The creepy neighbor boy was a bit far fetched but added the third part of the story that i believe it needed. The use of roses was amazing and were perfect for the times they were used. the cast for this was a perfect selection. Kevin Spacey played a perfect role as the miserable father/husband. Thora Birch was the best choice for a wanna popular dark teenager. Overall this was a great movie to watch and one worth its time."

","In the footsteps of David Lynch, this film explores the nightmare underbelly of suburbia USA, when ordinary people try to be extraordinary. With dire results. Beautifully crafted, and with a definitive performance by Kevin Spacey, ably supported by a great cast, this is a standout film. A man in middle age crisis, feeling himself to be a loser in every respect, becomes infatuated with a young girl friend of his daughter. Revives his zest for living, but complications include a homophobic neighbor, with a weird son; his wife having a relationship with the Real Estate King, and his daughter becoming involved with the weirdo next door. An explosive and unexpected finish makes this a film to remember."

","This is truly an excellent movie. However I can see why some people do not enjoy nor like this movie, this is by no means the kind of movie you grab some pop corn and drink then watch through it. This is a movie that requires you to concentrate on every scene, and think about the meanings behind them. That is what makes this movie great.<br/><br/>Unlike most movies in nowdays, there is no hero, there is no running chasing blowing things up to give the audiences adrenaline rush. This is a drama that will make you re-evaluable your life with respect to your culture, every protocol we know in life versus our desire to seek happiness. It is a movie that in a very realistically subconscious way depict our modern lives.<br/><br/>I will not go in much detail here to spoil the movie, if you have not seen this movie, see it. I cannot guarantee that you will like it, but I can assure that if you think about what the movie is trying to say, you will have a happier life :)"
"gftbiloxi","10","3","5","23 April 2005"," The Image of Success
","The Burnhams are a typical, upwardly mobile family: a father with a well-paid job in advertising, a mother who is a driven real estate sales agent, an angst-ridden teen age daughter who is at an age to despise her parents. They live in a lovely home with a white picket fence, lovely roses, and a red door. Everything about them projects an image of success. And yet-- Lester (Kevin Spacey) hates his advertising job, which makes him feel like a prostitute selling second rate wares to stupid johns. Caroline (Annette Benning) is frustrated at being second-best in the real estate business. Daughter Jane (Thorah Birch) finds both of her parents vapid and doubts her own validity as a person--particularly when compared with her beautiful, sexed-up best friend Angela (Mena Suvari.) Their lives, like the lives of so many others rushing ""to get ahead in the world,"" have become less about actually living than about maintaining and improving upon the appearance of success so prized by society.<br/><br/>What is most astonishing about the film is its complete believability. Speaking as one who has worked a great deal in advertising and sales, I was amazed with the accuracy with which Ball's powerful and darkly funny script captured the lives of those whose values rest exclusively upon external achievement--Lester's growing and barely concealed hatred for advertising and Caroline's constant use of self-help tapes and personal success mantras are truly commonplace in the business world.<br/><br/>Now, if American BEAUTY were merely this and nothing more, it would still be an astonishing film. But it goes considerably further than that--for Lester, suddenly motived by a lust for his daughter's friend Angela, realizes how completely unenjoyable ""keeping up appearances"" has become. And he explodes the status quo in such a way as to bring every one's petty materialism and mask-like personaes into a sharp, very funny, and pitch-black focus as the shallow and meaningless things they are. And in the process he both finds and destroys himself forever.<br/><br/>The cast is astonishing throughout, with Kevin Spacey the ultimate ""I Can't Take It Any More"" man and wife Annette Benning the ultimate vision of every hard-core sales representative it has ever been my misfortune to meet, a woman determined to ""project an image of success at all times"" even if it kills her. Thora Birch is a remarkable young performer, as is her boyfriend Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari is perfectly cast as the youthful beauty for whom Spacey develops an unexpected passion. Mendes' direction is flawless here, and he navigates the both the complicated appearances of success and the personal shallowness it conceals with tremendous clarity, never overplaying his hand in either direction.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most telling bits of the film are among the most subtle, as when the film posits the tiresomely yuppie but nonetheless considerably more honest gay couple next door as more genuine than the Burhams, Caroline's eternal efforts at ego building through motivational tapes, and the way in which Angela (in time honored teenage fashion) naively attempts to use sex as a weapon to conceal her own insecurities.<br/><br/>The film is extremely funny, but it is also ultimately devastating. A great many people--particularly those who equate ""an image of success"" with successful lives, will despise the film. But like it or not, American BEAUTY's take on the failure on the failure of the American dream is easily the most successful and deadly accurate satire on life in these United States since the equally wicked NETWORK. This is the real thing, people--and it may be too close to home for many. Watch it at your own risk. Strongly, strongly recommended.<br/><br/>Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"

The first time i saw it, i begun to think in everything can happen in the planet and we don't expect. All the bad actions, the secrets, the lies, the supposed beauty... perfection. That's not beauty. I think the movie just... stay in the brain and the thoughts of everyone who see it. Something so stressing in the film: Ricky's father.

","Without a doubt, American Beauty is the most overrated movie I have seen. For those of you who have read Joan Didion, this script smacks of Play It As It Lays.<br/><br/>What happens when a ""typical"" suburban professional male realizes his dissatisfaction with his life? He reacts in an insubstantial and unconvincing way. My job stinks - quit my job. I have trouble communicating with my daughter - smoke dope. My wife is distant and cold - fantasize about another woman. And so on. Yes, it is Mar-eye-ah cracking a boiled egg on the steering wheel all over again (Didion reference).<br/><br/>Here's the question I really wanted this movie to explore: if, at midlife, Lester really feels that his life is not what he expected, where does he want it to go, what will he do about it, and can he get away with it.<br/><br/>Sorry, but get religion, join the French Foreign Legion, or start a home-based business.

","I have this movie on DVD and I watch it over and over again, and Alan Ball and Sam Mendes have shown me the omphh that has been missing in other films for a long time. I subscribe to a lot of the accolades to this film, but I do not think that it deserved Best Picture. It was an excellent film- but not an important one. As a kid, I grew up in suburban Orange County where there was truly a lot more than what seemed. I've seen comments posted that state that all of the ""corruption"" just isn't there: ""fascist, repressed Marine Corps colonels; middle-aged men obsessed with high school girls; drug distribution amongst teenagers; etc."" Well, I have news for those soccer moms who like to live in their hermedically sealed worlds and listen to Celine Dion- ""LOOK CLOSER""! Kevin Spacey deserved Best Actor and Annette Bening was quite impressive as the two-faced housewife. The supporting characters were just as good and this movie never seemed to drag. It is not for everyone: it is unsettling, disturbing and somewhat raw. But a majority of conservative societies don't want the kind of in-your-face dynamic which this movie has. Well, okay. That's why they have movies like ""Stuart Little."""
"zentropa","10","3","5","7 September 1999"," Best Movie of the Year
","`American Beauty' is a film that comes along and says things like few films have ever done before. A film that is maddening brilliant in how it audaciously blends the absurd with the dramatic.<br/><br/>Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) wakes up one morning and announces in a voice-over that his life is miserable and that the highlight of his day will be his morning jerk-off session in the shower. He then proceeds to tell us about how, one year from now, a certain incident will occur. For the next two hours we are exposed to the incidents that lead to that moment.<br/><br/>Lester and his wife Carolyn (Annette Benning) have no marriage. They hate each other and they do not relate to their daughter in any way. Jane (Thora Birch) has little respect for them, in return.<br/><br/>Lester's life changes when he and his wife force themselves to go to a school basketball game, where Jane is performing on the cheerleading team. There, Lester becomes entranced by Jane's best friend Angela (Mena Suvari). <br/><br/>This attraction seems rather frivolous at this point in the film, because it appears that the attraction is based solely on sexual desire. Angela is a beautiful, cocky young woman who's sole philosophy is to not be ordinary. She feels that because she is a stunner--a seductress--she is beyond everyone else. The ironic thing is that towards the end of the film, she is emotionally crippled when she has to admit that she is ordinary. The sad thin, in turn, and what lies at that heart of the movie, is that one does not need to be extraordinary to be ordinary--that beauty lies in everything, as long as such beauty is appreciated.<br/><br/>Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) is the mysterious new next door neighbor who becomes secretly obsessed with Jane--videotaping her at every turn. At first, this activity turns Jane off, until she becomes entranced by the reasoning behind this. His father, Wes, caught him doing pot one day and sent him to military school, where Ricky almost killed a boy--in turn, he was sent to a sanitarium. The family moves in next door and you are given a dose of true dysfunction.<br/><br/>It is through Ricky's obsessive video collection--through which he videotapes the world--that we get to learn the theme of the movie. It is through Ricky that Jane begins to live and learns to love herself. Ricky, one of the saddest characters I have seen in film history, is a boy who learned to appreciate the beauty of life while trying to escape the horrors of his home. His father Wes is an evil man, haunted by demons that are later revealed, who is obsessed with discipline.<br/><br/>I can't say much more about the movie simply because there is just too much to say about it, and also because I don't want to spoil the process the characters take to change their lives and how these lives end up--especially in the very `suspenseful' final minutes.<br/><br/>All I can say is that there are scenes in this film that have hit me like few other scenes have hit me. Much is not seen of Barbara, Ricky's mom, in the film--but one scene, where she looks at her son's beaten faced is so shocking and tragic because of the line she tells him when she touches his face. The words are uttered by a woman who--as the audience can tell--has been emotionally paralyzed by her husband. The words are ironic in the context in which they are said--but the fear and motivation is perfectly understood.<br/><br/>Annette Benning has given the performance of the year. May they give her the Oscar this very woman. This woman juggles drama with comedy like only a true master can. There is one particular scene, where she fails to sell a house, and she begins to cry. Just when you think she is being melodramatic, she begins to beat herself senseless--only to then contain herself. Ditto for Spacey and the bravura turn he gives as a man who basically decides to reclaim a lost life--and focus on what is truly important in his life. From anger to smugness--every expression is as three-dimensional as the next, showing us that he is one of our greatest actors.<br/><br/>The film is completely adept in exploring the dysfunctional lives of characters coming to terms with the meaning of their lives. These are characters who are miserable in their present states. These are characters who decide to change. Some succeed and some fail--sometimes on their own or based on the actions of others. Others, after claiming happiness, only loose it and seek to punish the ones that took that momentary nirvana away from them. Alan Ball directed this complex gem with the finesse only a true master could posses. <br/><br/>The theme of the movie centers around the concept of what is ordinary and what kind of beauty lies within the ordinary and you leave the theatre, after hearing the final voice-over, looking around you and truly observing the significance of everything and how the importance that you give to objects truly reflects the way you perceive yourself and your place in the world.<br/><br/>The metaphors are explored beautifully (i.e. rose petals) as are characters motivations (i.e. the color of hedge clippers). A film so complex in meaning, it will take more than one viewing to fully digest. A film so important because, like few before, it truly makes a brave and relevant comment on our place in the world and how we relate to others. A film that, for me, blew away just about every other film I saw this year."

","Watching ""American Beauty"" is like looking into a handful of American lives slowly plunging into moral and emotional devastation. Although these people are gaining a sincerely fulfilling happiness, they are also slowly losing their grip on human value and order. This is not your average social commentary, it has something most satires lack; poignancy. On one hand, this is a scathing examination of the facades and truths that surround a seemingly ""perfect"" suburban family, displaying what it would be like if everyone's true colours emerged, as they liberate themselves from the painful phoniness that society forces them to live by. One the other hand, ""American Beauty"" is a thought-provoking and emotionally devastating character study of two families finally achieving joy for the first time in their lives, unaware of the profound impact they are having on themselves and each other, and neglecting the consequences that will inevitably follow. ""American Beauty"" shines in almost everyway, from it's stunning imagery of beauty fused with immorality, to it's darkly hilarious script, this is one of those rare films that stay with you for a long time. But the main thing that makes this movie soar are the performances, Kevin Spacey and Anette Benning are simply sensational as the feuding married couple exploring new realms of life,  Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Mena Suvari and Thora Birch also showcase excellent performances. A truly remarkable film."

","What an awful film.  There are no characters you can like, or even identify with unless, as apparently its makers expect, you are a dysfunctional chronic depressive who hates his life, spouse, child, sexuality, job, age, parents, and, I guess, credible stories.  This is a badly made quilt of patches, each one composed of the non-story (I'll explain that) of someone so badly messed up that you'll think your most depressed friend should be giving them peer counseling.  And, that's too bad because there are limitless chances to actually do something with characters like these. Instead, each one sort of commences a personal evolution, and hints of humor surround all of these initial bursts out of the gate.  But, then, each one just sort of slows from that first sprint down to a jog, then walk, then kind of aimless amble, producing a non-story, every single time.<br/><br/>There is no one you can like, root for, or care about in this movie.  They are all flawed people with easy lives, yet endless anxieties.  None of them tries to deal with their problems, worst of all star Kevin Spacey who deliberately takes a job with ""as little responsibility as possible.""  Even that potentially funny excursion goes nowhere, as we see almost nothing of his new position (which could have been grist for both the comedy mill, and the social commentary this film wants to be perceived as making, but doesn't.)<br/><br/>As a kind of grand joke (but really an insult), the very last line, done in narration, tricks you into thinking this worthless piece of grinding misrepresentation was actually some kind of life-affirming, we-shall-overcome example of the human spirit.  Uh... no, it isn't.  If you want that, see, ""The World According to Garp,"" a thousand-times better movie than this.  The last time I saw this kind of one-liner attempt at putting an audience in an emotional vice to squeeze out a warm feeling was when one of the characters pointlessly says ""mazel tov"" to a victimized Jewish character in a Broadway production of ""Grand Hotel.""  The Manhattan audience, as required, went ""awww.""  But I've warned you this time, so don't fall for it.<br/><br/>If you want a slice-of-life movie where things are a little less extreme (read that, ""actually believable""), with some fun spots worth laughing at mixed with its philosophies, see ""The Wonder Boys.""  It's what this movie wishes it were, or should have.  On the other hand, if you are a manic depressive who is never manic, you are going to love ""American Beauty."""

","Don't get me wrong I did not hate this film. But to bracket in the top 10 of all time and to mention it in the same breath as Star Wars, Shawshank Redemption etc is a pathetic travesty. Where do I start?<br/><br/>Spoilers The Film is about a middle aged drug taker running around after a girl young enough to be his grand daughter, a couple constantly arguing non stop, a teenage daughter who doesn't get on with her parents etc etc - all of which you'll find in any episode of any second rate soap opera. i don't hear people raving about ""the message"" in them.<br/><br/>It's the old 'Dead Poets Society' all over again. People trying to impress others by pretending to enjoy the 'deep hidden meaning' behind the film. Statistically, that can't be true. In reality we live in a world where the public are so stupid they chase pediatricians out of their home because they get the word muddled up with paedophiles. That many people are not that clever.<br/><br/>I appreciate I have never been to America, so have little idea whether that reflects US reality, but in England (and maybe everywhere else) it doesn't wash at all.<br/><br/>I just don't see ""so much beauty everywhere I look"". Where I go, I see muggings, assaults, filthy run down council estates that haven't had the rubbish collected for 6 months, and trains not fit for rodents and this is in one of the most popular cities in the world.<br/><br/>Like Pulp Fiction, this film assumes we have an insatible desire for drug and sex storylines. OK some people do, but lots don't. I also happened to find the daughter more attractive than her friend. The rest of the cast, admittedly excellent actors, were an incredibly weird group of people, and the tough ex army bloke who hates gays and then turns out to be one? Do me a favour. So to the stereotypical teenage blonde girl.<br/><br/>I'll admit to not always being clever enough to find meanings in films, but then I am one of the few people who really couldn't care less whether a film has a hidden message or not. I want to turn my brain off when I sit down to watch a film. I just want a beginning, middle and end.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be able to tell you the entire meaning behind Shawshank Redemption, The Great Escape or any of the other great films there are. I just wish others would admit the same instead of trying to show off by pretending to understand and by making a lot more of films than what the writer intends. Exactly the same way people do with poetry. After all, this was a storyline that almost everyone would have encountered in their life.<br/><br/>I dread to think what these sort of people would make of me if they scrutinised my every move.

","American Beauty is a great movie about beauty. Everything you see in this movie is beautiful, even those which seem ugly. Kevin Spacy acts Lester character delicately and beautifully.

Some scenes are unforgettable. for instance, the scene in which Ricky shows the most beautiful thing he had ever filmed. This scene is so touching. In fact, the whole movie is touching. I felt every characters in the movie. And at last, the name of the movie is some kind of a metaphor. Because American Beauty is the name of the variety of hybrid rose.(according to Webster Dictionary) Spielberg has found a new talent again(Sam Mendes) and of course Sam has done a great job for his movie directing debut. The film deserved to gain 100 oscars instead of one for best picture. Thanks to Alan Ball and all who were involved in making this special and beautiful movie."

I think Dreamworks isn't a good idea. I'll give it a 3, but I'm sure that after the Oscars it will be a 1 for me.

Like a bad wake-up call, I realized how stupid and idiotic this film was, kind of like enjoying a video game from 1986, then seeing how poorly it has aged compared to today's standards. American Beauty accomplished this in a matter of months. <br/><br/>The characters, except for Lester, had no point. The kids were poorly drawn characters, excessive moot that could have been edited out of the film.

A simple setting is ideal for showing the deep underlyings of society, but we should care about the characters.  All the characters in this movie are freaks.  They're violent or mean, and you really don't care for any of them.  You don't feel sympathy, and half the time you're afraid one of them is going to just flip out and kill everyone. The movie is too graphic for it's own good.  The violence and non-stop sex related material are enough to get the point across without the excessive drug use as well.  This movie has tremendous performances and the best filming you are likely to ever see, but don't expect a nice movie to see a Sunday afternoon.

"lotus_chief","1","8","20","3 April 2004"," VERY overrated, stereotypical, artsy NONSENSE!
","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW!!***<br/><br/>People will most likely respond to my review as someone who 'didn't get' American Beauty.  What really is there to 'get'?  Critics and moviegoers alike swore by this film, and their praises were supposedly justified by the Academy, as they gave it 5 Oscars, including Best Picture, Actor & Director. Let me say that this film was by no means worthy of the praise and awards it got.  Watching this movie today let me FURTHER know how useless and unreliable the Academy is in recognizing REAL films.  Just put AB on the long list of films unworthy of the awards & recognition it received.<br/><br/>
I just don't see the big deal with AB.  Everything I saw just came off as clichéd, worn out 'ideas', including crass overacting and a non-existent 'plot'.  What was the point of this movie?  Ok, it's a view of white middle class American suburbia; pretty obvious.  What else is there to grasp on here?  I'm actually surprised that the Academy/media has accepted the movie as much as they did.  They're actually PROUD of what was shown here to endorse it as much as they did?  Hmph!  It goes to show you how pathetic and backwards American culture is.  It is laughable at how horrible the execution of this film is.  It's not hard to see what the makers were trying to do; they just failed to do it.  There's no direction with the film, just a bunch of tired ideas thrown together supposedly to show people just how crazy, pathetic, misguided and plain stupid white America is.  Quite frankly it made me laugh at America even more.  It'll be interesting how foreign people thought of this movie, whether they were able to even critique it without bursting out in uncontrollable laughter at the thought of an ounce of this being true.<br/><br/>There wouldn't have been much of a movie if the characters kept their damn window blinds shut.  It is comical things like this that pull the film deeper and deeper into utter stupidity by its end.  Kevin Spacey was good in his role, but it's nothing he hasn't done before.  His performance definitely did NOT deserve an Oscar.  It's the same ol' dull, 'barely keep ya eyes open, slur your lines' Spacey we've all come to know pretty well; nothing special.  Seeing his performance only cements my belief that Denzel Washington should very well have won the Best Actor Oscar for Hurricane, a FAR more meaningful performance.  I wouldn't have minded if Russell Crowe won for his EXCELLENT performance in The Insider, his best performance to date and also way better than Spacey's performance.  Annette Bening was just pathetic to watch, way too much overacting; just a sad, poor excuse of a 'performance'.  No one else is worth mentioning acting wise.<br/><br/>
I don't see the beauty in this film.  The whole movie was just silly. Many people have already talked about it, but c'mon.. a plastic bag?  The makers just went out of their way to paint these suburban, middle-class whites as pathetic, stupid, meaningless and empty they really are.  A stalker weed head drug dealer who finds beauty in a plastic bag blowing in the wind and has a fetish for videotaping everything; a Marilyn Manson look-a-like daughter who likes getting naked in front of a window; her wannabe whorish friend who really hasn't 'done it' before and has a stupid, whorish opinion for everything; the most pathetic character of em all - the complete loser of a wife who's unfaithful and 'won't be a victim' when she actually causes, and deserves for that matter, everything that happens to her; and the ill-fated pedophile husband who feels he has to take control of his life by wacking off every morning in the shower and reliving his 'glory days' of the 60s - not limited to smoking weed, listening to Pink Floyd albums, and lifting weights to impress a 16 year old.  Can't forget the next door neighbor ex-Marine colonel who seems homophobic at first only to turn out to be gay himself; and the new male gay couple who just moved in trying to play like they're normal and make friends with everyone on the block.  I'm telling ya it doesn't get any better than this!  A world full of down-on-their-luck white so-called big wigs who don't know how to close their window blinds; and at the drop of a hat jump to complete lunacy and thoughts of suicide once things don't go their way.  All while that plastic bag blows in the wind.  'Look closer' they said.. for what?  You're not showing me anything I haven't seen before, not to mention you're showing it in the most illogical, far-fetched and utterly stupid fashion.  What a load of crap this 'movie' was.  There's a serious dogfight going on between AB and Titanic for the number 1 spot on my 'Most Overrated Films of All-Time' list.  AB is a terrible film; nothing but a big fraud - the likes I haven't seen since Titanic and Forrest Gump.  If this isn't a good case I don't know what would be but..DON'T believe the hype.  Number 29 on IMDb's Top 250..hell I won't even bother attempting to measure the credibility of that list anymore..now I've seen it all.  But why am I surprised?  LOTR ROTK is #4.  Calling American Beauty art is like saying feces is odorless...not only is it not, it's pretty rancid as well.<br/><br/>ZERO out of **** stars."

","*May Contain Spoilers*<br/><br/>Critics be damned - American Beauty has got to be one of the most despicable depictions of male, mid-life crisis that has ever been filmed.<br/><br/>If Kevin Spacey's character, Lester Burnham, was supposed to actually represent an average, 42 year-old, American male in mid-life crisis, then I believe that our society, in general, is in even more trouble than I had originally thought. Burnham was, basically, nothing but a big, self-centered baby.<br/><br/>I was truly astounded to see just how utterly slimy that Burnham was in his day-to-day dealings with other people. For starters, to terminate his employment at the advertising firm, Burnham actually stooped to threatening his boss with blackmail and exposing him as a homosexual, even though the guy wasn't even a homosexual, at all.<br/><br/>Lester Burnham, a low-life, pedophilliac bugger, who lusted like a grunting pig after 16 year-old girls, deserved the crappy job that he chose for himself at MacDonalds. Being a crummy, little burger-flipper was so him.<br/><br/>Even though I don't condone cold-blooded murder, I certainly felt no remorse for Burnham when he was gunned down by Frank Fits. In a sense, he bloody-well had it coming.<br/><br/>One can only shudder to think of how many other people's lives that Burnham would have eventually contaminated had he continued to remain alive. At the rate that he was going I'm sure that he would have inevitably resorted to exposing himself in public, or molesting very young children, or something as equally vile as that.<br/><br/>I find it very-very peculiar, indeed, that American Beauty actually struck such a unanimously positive chord with a vast number of the movie-going public. I guess that these many viewers must've strongly identified with the screwed-up characters and off-kilter situations that were presented in this movie. I surely didn't feel that way. <br/><br/>All-in-all, I certainly saw nothing in American Beauty that even slightly resembled that of ""beauty"" (above or below the surface). It was all looking pretty ugly to me.<br/><br/>What more can I say?"

I didn't have big expectations for it and thought that would make me judge the movie properly. From the start of the first scene with the main character masturbating under the shower I pretty much knew the movie was going to be a pain to watch and my open mind quickly went out of the door. This movie has little to cheer about, not considering plot, not considering its characters. The acting is good but I don't watch movies only to see good acting, but more to see a nice interesting story and ditto characters. There was really no character to feel sympathy for. They were all clichés, boring, unsympathetic just doing what millions people do when their life is not going that well. I know the movie is supposed to be portraying real life and many people seem to love those kind of movies. In that case the movie is good for what it is. I'm just concerned that a movie gets praised so much despite the kind of message it sent out. Life stinks?? This movie stank for me. If you loved it, good for you and ignore my review.

The way it was written, the sheer POETRY of the words, made me want to just sit there and read for the rest of my life. I could physically see the action happening in my head, without even knowing who played the characters, and every single word was just as impactful (if not more) than if I had seen it on the big screen.<br/><br/>This is an overall EXCELLENTLY written movie, with an incredible plot line and especially the twisted ending. The music also helps to bring out the true emotions of the film, utilizing every millisecond of the instrumental power provided by the excellent composing skills of Thomas Newman to intensify the raw power of emotion this film possesses.

Unfortunately, what they did produce was a college boy's idea of what's ""deep"" - misunderstood drug-dealer, closet homosexuality, the beauty of plastic bags - and the plastic bag wasn't the sole piece of rubbish.  I really don't like this movie: the director and scriptwriter should be forced to watch the complete oeuvre of Benny Hill as punishment for inflicting on us that ""rolling a joint being mistaken for oral sex"" scene.

","Enough pro and con comments have been written about this so-called Oscar-winning ""masterpiece"" for me to make this review a brief one--but to the point. 'American Beauty' took up too much time to tell a relatively uncomplicated story of mid-life crisis involving several severely disfunctional personalities. If it gives you pleasure to watch Kevin Spacey be little more than sarcastic for two hours or to watch a shallow youth show you a plastic bag pushed about by the wind as a sample of beauty in little things, then this movie is for you. The only genuinely moving and original character in the movie is not Spacey--it's Chris Cooper as the homophobic neighbor who suspects his son is having an affair--with tragic results. His performance in the climactic garage scene is stunning. The symbolism of the rose petals was overplayed and much too simplistic. As was the lengthy shot of the floating plastic bag which so many viewers found deep meaning in--but struck me as arty, pretentious and boring. With a rambling and vulgar script, this emerged as no more than a sad commentary on the complete collapse of American culture. All of the characters are not only weird but unlikeable. For me, this was an ordeal to sit through--the only jolt I got was from the ending (which took too long to get to)-- and then, mercifully, I was able to take the cassette out, certain that I would never want to view the movie again, despite the fact that it won a Best Film Oscar.

","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs<br/><br/>American Beauty follows pretty much in the outline of Fight Club,the best film I have seen in a very long time,in it's themes about commercial fulfillment,the barriers constricting the boredom of life,and human emptieness.The best scene to reflect this I found in here was when the films main charecter Lester,played by Kevin Spacey,has a go at his wife after she makes a quip to him about not spilling any of his beer on an expensive new sofa she's got.This scene quite brilliantly reflects how the commercial value of our possessions has become our main cause for concern,rather than concern for each other. Or maybe this is just the suburban situation in America.Whatever the wake up call was aimed at,whoever it's targeted towards ought to take note.Though the main character is initially seeming quite intent to accept his boring life,we learn that underneath the kind of easy going exterior he puts on,a lot of people are actually taking advantage of him,his boss,his colleagues,his daughter,his wife.This movie remarkably portrays how glamourous and satisfying breaking free from a constraint on your life can be.<br/><br/>Aside from the main character, all of the other characters are pretty sad cases as well.His wife is a self obsessed,over expectant career woman,who only gets sad about what's bothering her.His daughter is a distant,stubborn teenager ,who does'nt give any clear indication of what she wants.Her friend is a narrow minded,pretentious,and stupid slapper,who prides herself on how sexually explicit her shenanigans with other men are.And as for the new neighbours,well.....................perfect example of how American families are supposedly losing the ability to communicate,understand,love,and,heck,even know each other.<br/><br/>This film perfectly captures you in each of these shallow people's miserable lives,and gets you caring about their various outcomes.All the performances are,obviously,excellent,and Sam Mendes provides unique,insightful direction into a film which requires these new touches.<br/><br/>Overall,having seen it,I'm glad American Beauty won all the oscars it did.For once,they gave them to a film that truly deserved it.*****"

","Middle-aged Lester has an epiphany about his dull life, and in the 20 years after American Beauty's release it seems Hollywood experienced one as well. This gritty, stylish and irreverent film is a shift from previous decades and the typical way that major studios do business.<br/><br/>Lester experiences a series of shocks that he surprisingly takes in stride; fired from his job, cuckolded by his wife Carolyn, taunted by his teen daughter Jane, and more. Fantasy comes to the rescue for him in the form of Jane's friend Angela. While his world and the people around him crumble, Lester aims to live up to Angela's positive impressions of him and prove it is never too late to get it back.<br/><br/>American Beauty impacted my life. After seeing it with my then wife Jennifer in 1999 in Arlington, Virginia, I vowed not to find myself in Lester's situation. It influenced me to be a park ranger even though it is ""McDonalds work"" to her.<br/><br/>Though many of the characters in American Beauty act trapped, some such as Lester begin to realize that it is useless to try to live as others think or demand you ought to live. When they cast aside the pressure and control they are greeted with hostility. ""You can't go around doing whatever you feel like,"" says one of the manipulators, ""there are rules in life."" But there is also so much beauty in the world, and Lester and those like him vow to immerse themselves in it.<br/><br/>American Beauty is an intriguing and artful portrait of suburban dysfunction and a middle-class underworld, but also inspiration for rising above circumstances. Compelling film techniques include falling flower petals, spotlighting, fantasy sequences, jarring music, mist, slow-motion, and more. Kevin Spacey(Lester) and Annette Bening (Carolyn) are perfectly cast. The film earned 25 times its estimated production cost ($350 billion, which is 120 times the entire budget of the agency I work for, the National Park Service). By non-Hollywood standards the film still is somewhat tame and I wish the film makers had been even more daring."

In the poetries, the authors express their feelings with difficulties, when they would find something touching. In the plays, the main characters often act long monologues and soliloquies, to express their feelings and most of the time their doubts. Especially when they would try to move on, by facing unexpected tragic moments. Some plays would end in bad way, which the main characters die only after, they have found something precious that they have been looking for. Others would end in good way, which the main characters live in the peaceful places, where they express their happiness through a long final monologue. After Sam Mendes has directed some plays, he seems interested to explore the theme about beauty. Especially after he read the script written by Alan Ball, which has been offered by Steven Spielberg who saw a potential in Sam Mendes. In 1999 came out American Beauty by Sam Mendes, with Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper and Mena Suvari. The movie's plot: Lester Burnham is a depressed 42 years old man who is unsatisfied with his job, he has also difficulties to talk with his wife Carolyn and his daughter Jane. But since Lester falls in love with Angela Hayes, who is Jane's best friend, he starts to change his life. Carolyn and Jane change their lives as well, until an unexpected conclusion would happen. The movie from the beginning to the end, is filled with mise-en-scènes to create images to look like paintings. These mise-en-scènes are helped by the lightnings to make the scenes more atmospheric, especially when the main characters express their emotions in the specific moments. All the actors played characters who have in common, that they are searching for something important in the course of the story. Kevin Spacey was excellent as Lester Burnham, who initially was excluded like he is not as important as Carolyn and Jane. Until Lester would meet Angela Hayes to change his life, as he starts to do sport to get physically fit, he quits his job to find another one and befriends with the new neighbor Ricky Fitts who would give Lester pots to smoke. Annette Bening did a well done performance as Carolyn Burnham, who tries to be as successful as her real estate competitor Buddy Kane. Then Carolyn would have an affair with Buddy, to have found the success she has been looking for. Thora Birch was really good as Jane Burnham, who would initially act like her friend Angela Hayes. But since Jane falls in love with the neighbor Ricky Fitts, she would be herself to not imitate anymore the behavior of Angela. Wes Bentley did a well done performance as Ricky Fitts, who once he meets Lester and Jane Burnham, he would show both of them a way to find something they missed. Since Lester starts to smoke pots, thanks to Ricky, Lester would kind of live again the youth he missed. Jane would initially not trust Ricky, by looking him with bad eyes. Until she finds a way to be confident with him, as they would have a relationship to be close with each other. Then Chris Cooper was excellent as Colonel Frank Fitts, who would be initially seen as a restricted and homophobic character to not express any emotions. As he would often hit his son Ricky for a foolish discipline, until something would change him to be more emotional and less restricted. Finally Mena Suvari was also excellent as Angela Hayes, who would be seen as an avoided teenage girl. Especially when she tells stories on the time where she had sex with a lot of men, until it would be find out she is a girl who wants to be just a popular teenager. The script was elaborated to see how the story would be developed, from the beginning to the end by creating a workable narration. The score by Thomas Newman creates the emotions needed, to make the scenes poetic and atmospheric. As the tracks of the score are compatible with the most important scenes, by making them unforgettable and emotional. American Beauty is one of the best Sam Mendes' movies, it is also one of the best movies of the 90s."

","American Beauty is a romantic comedy that doesn't suck, which is a nice break. It follows a man stuck in an unhealthy relationship with his wife and eventually falls in love with his 16-year-old daughter's best friend. It's an unconventional love story, and it's done beautifully. <br/><br/>The plot is great. It's presented in a very comedic way and it's actually very funny. It's interesting and realistic, which is a little surprising, but nothing ever felt out of place. The subplot is also very good, and while I think we've all seen it before I think that it was the more relatable and serious of both plots, which created a really nice balance of both fun and seriousness.<br/><br/>The characters are quite good too. You have a good idea of who they are, and they aren't horribly far-fetched either. All of them were flawed people, but not so flawed and that they were obviously fake. A lot of them, especially Kevin Spacey's character, were very likable as well. <br/><br/>Like I already said, the movie is very funny. But all the humor is done in a very natural way. During character conversations they might say something funny, but it's part of the conversation and further develops their character as well as furthers the conversation, so it exists as more than just a joke. <br/><br/>Overall American Beauty is fantastic. The plot and subplot are very good, the characters are great, and it's incredibly funny without feeling forced. In the end I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this movie, so long as you're willing to be wowed."
"nishantreads","8","2","3","9 February 2016"," The film is very open ended and endorses different appreciations. That's the secret of this film, I believe.
","The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was a very weird movie. The experience quickly faded off, although I that boy-who- records's character intrigued me a little. Yesterday, I chose to give this movie another watch and I couldn't emphasize enough how drastically my opinion has changed. <br/><br/>The second watch helped me form a better view about this. And if it is anything to go by, I believe it is one hell of an anti- establishment movie. Almost all the characters are, although seemingly ""normal"", are living pathetic lives- all except the boy- who-shoots. It is revealed later on why he is way ahead of all other characters in terms of appreciation of ""beauty"" as he calls it. The film showcases a drastic transformation in the lives of every character. The facades come crumbling down. All the tightly- knitted culturedness, normalcy's, belief-systems come apart as characters discover how pathetic all their lives are. The younger generation is more open to changes, the elders- the more they resist change- the more frustrated they become. Meanwhile it is revealed that the most straight-jacketed (in terms of conservative notions like homosexuality, marriage, discipline) is a secret admirer of fascism and the most sorrowful character. Slowly, as all the characters let go and accept their natural feelings, instincts, desires- sometimes bordering on scandalous- they feel better, relaxed, happier. All but one is transformed. <br/><br/>The film describes how heavy orthodox beliefs can get, how they have the power of consuming people's lives, harming people. The film, for me, is an acute critique of all means of classifying things into binaries. It endorses a more tolerant view of life and portrays the insidious nature of judgments. I loved it and would watch it again, soon."

","Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), 42, has spent years trapped in an unhappy marriage and an unsatisfying job. His relationship with his teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is almost as strained as that with his career-driven realtor wife Carolyn (Annette Bening). When Lester becomes infatuated with his daughter's friend Angela (Mena Suvari), it marks the beginning of a severe mid-life crisis that sees him revisiting the carefree ways of his youth, but at a cost.<br/><br/>Full of heart-rending pathos, yet told with an irresistible streak of dark humour, American Beauty is a thoroughly absorbing bittersweet drama, a poignant tale that peels back the layers of suburban life to reveal the pains of growing up and the disappointments of growing old. The big-screen debut of director Sam Mendes, the film boasts superb performances from an incredible ensemble cast (Spacey is particularly great, but no-one puts a foot wrong), excellent cinematography, and wonderful music (both score and soundtrack).<br/><br/>10/10: one of the finest films of the 90s and well deserving of its five Oscars."
"sandnair87","10","2","3","13 April 2015"," In Mendes' Curdled 'American' Dream, 'Beauty' Runs Deep!
","An acerbic, darkly comic critique of how social conventions can lead people into false, sterile and emotionally stunted lives, American Beauty is a real American original.<br/><br/>Something's rotten in suburbia and it doesn't take long to get to the source of the stink – the Burnhams. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a middle-aged burnout who is a marginalized husband to efficient, well-scrubbed Carolyn (Annette Benning) and a disregarded father to sullen teenager Jane (Thora Birch) and whose everyday life has degenerated into tedium. Browbeaten Lester is rejuvenated by the vision of a blonde Lolita. That the object of his obsession happens to be his daughter's best friend, a calculating sylph named Angela (Mena Suvari), matters not at all; he leaps into his fantasy like an enflamed teenager. Unhappy Carolyn undertakes an affair of her own while Jane, repulsed by her dad's hormonal attraction, secretly welcomes the attention of Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley), the strange, self-possessed boy next door. And just when things seem to be falling in place for the Burnhams, it all comes crashing down. If this sounds too depressing, guess again!<br/><br/>Although it's difficult to believe that humor can be found in this toxic portrait of superficial suburban values, predatory sexuality and domestic violence, rest assured it earns its laughs at every turn. Screenwriter Alan Ball gives the viewer a brief, horrific tour of crossed wires, inchoate longing, dashed illusions and resentment that wells from poisoned hearts with staggering self-assuredness. Sam Mendes (in one of the most promising debuts in cinematic history) whips the audience around from humor to horror to something poetic and humane. He suffuses the proceedings with a palpable sense of danger, keeping film-goers unsettled until the very end as to what exactly motivates these complicated characters. But he never loses sight of the humanity behind even the most reprehensible acts, a balancing act pulled off with unusual acumen.<br/><br/>American Beauty turns out to be emotionally satisfying, thanks in large part to a remarkably nuanced performance by Kevin Spacey. He commands the screen with a performance of subtlety, vulnerability and supreme confidence, in which he expresses mordant self-mockery and poignancy in a single gesture. He brings flawless comic timing to Lester's self-absorbed, infantile and rapacious behavior while holding on to the pathos of Lester's rage. Benning turns in her finest performance to date and all three teen players give sturdy and courageous portrayals in roles that would daunt actors twice their ages.<br/><br/>Visually daring, dramatically astute, and beautifully acted, American Beauty is a tart, funny and tremendously sobering movie about the deepest recesses of personal unhappiness. There's a sense of poignancy at the end, but also the feeling that we have been on an incredible trip through the lives and souls of three perfectly- realized characters. The result is the kind of artful defiance that Hollywood is usually too timid to deliver: a jolting comedy that makes you laugh till it hurts!"

","Lester Burnham was born when Jung said the world changed. Lester was a young boy with our very own favorite memory (lying on the grass looking at clouds). He fell in love with Carolyn when she still had joy in her. But he got a job he hated to support a family inside a box with a white picket cage around it, a world where you can make money to buy stuff you don't need but you can't buy stuff to make you feel alive because it is not ""sensible"" (the red Firebird). Gender relations had turned upside down: his wife dominated him to where Less-stir stirred less. He literally sat in the back seat. Family broke apart: his daughter wished her parents could ""get a life of their own."" Computers proliferated: profits, losses, and suckers ran glowingly across Lester's face for 17 years. His boss was not a leader or a mentor: his boss was a Brad. With human leadership assassinated, corporate tentacles extended everywhere. Homosexuality became open—to some—scary, to others. Drugs earned a secure place in the culture: Lester gave up drugs maybe too soon and now the kids were into them, making it convenient to have a peddler next door. That's the setup.<br/><br/>Lester's libido got tickled by an inappropriate target: a young girl. He spoke back to his wife who mocked him in bed. That made him smile. He smoked with a young boy who was falling in love with his own daughter. He pounded a brad back into Brad when Brad asked him to write his own death warrant in a corporate reorganization. He quit: he quit to get alive for at least a moment before he was to die. He started working out. This was tragically mis-read by the guy next door. It's Col. Fitz who is the tragic one, not Lester. Lester dies with a smile on his face after he realizes he ""feels great,"" that his daughter loves a sweet boy, that he doesn't care who is wife is f----ing. He becomes a father to the girl after whom he lusted: he wraps her in a protective blanket to set her free. He lets her be who she really is rather than who she thought she was supposed to be. They both grow up.<br/><br/>It's not a spoiler to say here that Lester dies: that's the first thing he tells us. You can't really die until you are alive—so the rest of the movie raises Lester from the deadened life he'd been trained to live. He—and hence we—look at life from above. We learn to smile with him: particularly when he delivers the sack of burgers. We see the perfect life is antiseptic white with vased slashes of reds, the way Carolyn would have it, or reds could fall like snow, the way fantasy has it, or the reds could be messy, messy, the way life has 'em. <br/><br/>Life messes up organization if we try to force ourselves into the back seat."

","I've had an account for close to 2 years now and after watching this film I felt the need to write my first review. To sum up 'American Beauty' in one word would be near impossible, Kevin Spacey's portrayal as the sick to death suburban husband and father who's desperately trying to figure out when and where it all went wrong is undoubtedly Oscar worthy on it's own merits, but as we all know Spacey always brings something to the table that others can't offer.<br/><br/>He takes us through a journey of mid-life self discovery and is able to accomplish what many forty-something ordinary..unhappy, bored with life husbands and fathers cannot, he's the feeling in your gut, he's the voice in the back of your head, telling you to do it, do what would end the misery and open yourself to the beauty of the world.<br/><br/>To watch this film for the first time 15 years after it's release and it still have an effect on the viewer says a lot for the film itself, it is becoming increasingly difficult for anything pre-2000 to stay relevant, especially in this modern mess of a world but 'American Beauty' delves into both adolescent and adult life with the tag line '...look closer' being so subtle yet so pertinent.<br/><br/>Coming into a review it is incredibly important to remain objective, but of course if one is writing passionately it may appear subjective, reading a lot of negative reviews about 'American Beauty' it appears one of the main critical points made is that the film is full of cliché's, or is described as one big cliché. It's not hard to see where these opinions come from but it's important to realise that not all great films need to be bursting with taboo matters and subjects, sometimes the simpler stories are the most eye opening...<br/><br/>'American Beauty' along side 'Fight Club' in my opinion is one of the most life affirming films that I have had the pleasure of watching, teaching that there's so much beauty in the world, in places and things you would never even think to look twice at, you've just got to be ready, and willing to be in that place, where you've not nothing to lose.<br/><br/>To reiterate, 'American Beauty' cannot be summed up in one word, you just have look closer, if you're ready."

The main point of the movie is not directly tied to the description up above - it is something that you will figure out for yourself..if you watch the movie.

","American Beauty is the epitome of perfect emotional cinema. It boasts great direction, screen writing and performances all round, making it, in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made.<br/><br/>The story follows Lester Burnham, a man who seems to have lost all hope in life, as he is stuck in a joyless marriage and has trouble connecting with his teenage daughter. This all changes when he meets Angela, his daughter's best friend. From then on, Lester decides to take back control of his life. The question is, how will it affect those around him?<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey gives a career defining performance and once again nails it as Lester, a man so fed up with life that he needed a radical change. The evolution of the character is done to perfection and Spacey's Oscar winning work is the proof. All other actors do their parts in great fashion as well and make the movie even better. With inspired performances like these, the film only gets better with a magical combination of Alan Ball's script and Sam Mendes' debut as a cinematic director. Among other things I love about this film, I can't go on without mentioning the heart wrenching soundtrack that pulls out a wallop of emotions.<br/><br/>American Beauty is a wonderful, yet ultimately tragic tale of how people can hide their true selves. However they choose to change, one thing is certain: it will affect everything in the status quo. Lester's story is the example of that and it is one that I will heartedly support every time I watch this movie.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10"
"aaron-takhar","9","2","3","12 February 2014"," The best film of the 90's
","From the start of Sam Mendes' film we are aware of the ending. It still comes as a bittersweet surprise. The film opens with a shot of the protagonist's street and eventually into his house. The protagonist is Lester Burnham played by an incredible Kevin Spacey. In these opening shots we see his wife and her co-ordinated garden and footwear and their ""better homes""esque house. From this it sounds like a glorification of the American dream.<br/><br/>The truth is the complete opposite as it smashes it. The opening song is entitled ""Dead Already"" from the films' apt soundtrack. Lester's groggy state is changed drastically when he first sees his daughter's ethereal friend Angela. He subsequently becomes infatuated with her. <br/><br/>The film is so great because it presents so many different themes which intertwine like the plot of a Tarantino film. The themes represent all the characters as neither heroes nor villains but victims of society and excessive materialism. It is a darkly hilarious satire which clearly has taken inspiration from George Orwell's novel ""1984"" and David Lynch's 1986 film ""Blue Velvet"". The cinematography by the masterful veteran Conrad Hall contains some of the most beautiful (it's thrown in on purpose) use of colour in film. It massively juxtaposes the brilliant yet unnerving reality of Alan Ball's witty and bleak script. <br/><br/>Lester goes on a journey to rediscover himself and subsequently leaves his job as an advertising executive and applies for a job in fast food. He begins a strict work-out regime (apart from occasionally smoking drugs). He also buys his childhood dream car. He continues with this adolescent demeanor until he eventually appeals enough to Angela. <br/><br/>Now this is where the film could have ended poorly, of course I won't ruin it for you. All that can be said is that the whole film is an exploration into the definition of beauty in our current society which is eventually found by Lester.<br/><br/>The characters are treated with delicacy as the story revolves around them all searching for something intangible. The film is so effective as a satire because it neither supports nor condemns any of the characters. It presents them and their lives objectively. In many ways Lester's representation is similar to Travis Bickle in ""Taxi Driver"" (1976). Inasmuch as both films contain a character study not analysis and leave enough ambiguity to morally agree or disagree with both characters. <br/><br/>In a nutshell ""American Beauty"" is the best movie of the 90's and the best of Spacey's illustrious career. Need I say more!"

","In his directorial debut, Sam Mendes took home five Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best director for American Beauty. American Beauty is a dark comedy that takes place in a perfect suburban neighborhood with what is supposed to represent the perfect suburban family, on the surface, but what lies underneath proves otherwise.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey brilliantly portrays Lester Burnham, an unhappy husband who undeniably has no control of what goes on in his personal and professional life. His wife drives him to and from work and views him as a colossal failure and very peculiar. His voice-over in the beginning of the film confirms that he will be dead in less than a year. He also feels in some ways, he is already dead. When Lester attends his daughter Jane's (Thora Birch) cheerleading performance with his overbearing and controlling wife Carolyn, played by Annette Bening, he develops an unlikely obsession with his daughter Jane's friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) and decides to turn his life around. He begins to fantasize regularly about Angela, quits his job, bribes his boss for $60,00, pursues a fast food career, works out and even smokes marijuana he buys from the new neighbor boy Ricky Fitz, played by Wes Bently.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses, the dark humor as well as a sense on sadness for the characters takes over the viewer. Carolyn, Lester's wife, has an affair with her real estate competitor, The Real Estate King Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher), and continues to unknowingly push her only daughter further away. Carolyn always appears to be very put together, right down to her pruning shears matching her clogs, but she has several breakdowns throughout the film. Jane is disturbed and disgusted by Angela's flirty behavior towards her dad, yet she continues to invite her to sleepovers. Jane also has self-image issues because her mom accuses her of purposely looking unattractive so this rebellious teen is saving her money for a breast augmentation. The neighbor Ricky videotapes the Burnham family daily in an effort to escape his own reality, focusing quite a bit on Jane who he tapes because she's intriguing. Ricky lives with his marine father Col. Frank Fitz USMC (Chris Cooper) who runs his family like the military. Col. Fitz tests Ricky for drugs and abuses him when he feels his son is disobeying the orders and morals of the family. What Ricky doesn't know is his father has a dark secret he also has been covering as well.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes created this masterpiece by minimizing the editing on the intense scenes and having the camera slowly focus in on the character or characters at that time. Typically, the scenes allow for the mood to be clearly represented because they focus in on the character's faces and expressions. The music in this film also plays a key role in allowing for smooth transitions from scene to scene. The music in this film is soft and subtle, it's whimsical and eerie, and it is also exotic and sensual. The music becomes the invisible sound throughout, allowing a deeper focus on the emotions and the moods of each of the characters.<br/><br/>An unfortunate turn of incidents in infidelity, sexuality confusion, complete miscommunication and assumption of circumstances cause this family and their neighbors to spiral out of control, some even to the point of no return. This movie ranks high on the must see list but not based solely on the script. The music, feelings, humor and drama make this an interesting film with twists and turns you may not see coming. It is Kevin Spacey's voice-over at the beginning and the end of American Beauty though, that set clarity to the entire mood and tone of the film. The deep, dark secrets of suburban life that are apparent in American Beauty are similar to those in Little Children (2006). Little Children also represents a story of infidelity, relationships, fantasies and controlling spouses. These movies send a strong message that everyone has a battle they are fighting and based on that, you should not judge people because you may have know idea who they really are or what they may be going through."

The film owes much to ""Sex, Lies and Videotape""; some to ""Ordinary People"" and ""The Ice Storm."" Others have pointed out that the ""from beyond the grave"" narration is not original. Every book on dramatic writing quotes Tolstoy: ""If there is a gun hanging on the wall in Act One, it had better be fired by the end of Act Two.""

Everyone else was so off kilter, so nuts, except maybe for the cheerleader queen, that we needed Lester's comments out of Spacey's twisting mouth, looking at Spacey's expressive eyes, to find the humor in a decent man trapped (most of it his own fault) in a desperate situation.<br/><br/>Annette Bening, who had a role full of hysteria, handled it so well, that you felt very sorry for her most of the time.<br/><br/>I was impressed with Chris Cooper in a very different part for him, and Allison Janney, who played his wife, could break your heart.<br/><br/>There were scenes of beauty, and one, in driving rain, full of tension, danger and poignancy.<br/><br/>All three kids were good too, but it is Spacey's film, and boy, does he run away with it.<br/><br/>I'd say go see it, but don't expect to feel good when you leave.<br/><br/>Murph"

","I saw a special preview of the movie tonight. It's true. I laughed. I cried. I saw some things there that I never thought would be there. But, nothing hit me so hard as the ending until 15 minutes after I had left. I had to walk away from the group of people I was with, because I was so flabergasted. I suggest anyone who wants a movie that will *truly* leave you moved (unlike a certain overhyped with movie), I HIGHLY press ""American Beauty"" onto you. I will be there many more times."
"J-Crew","Null","2","3","13 January 2000"," **** out of ****; Grade: A
","A transcendant, beautiful film about suburban decay circa late 1990s. Dark comedy mixes wonderfully well with serious drama, creating a dreamy though realistic narrative sprinkled liberally with fantasy. Spacey has never been better; his range and delivery are amazing. Equally deft supporting work from Bening, Suvari, and Cooper, with Birch and Bentley creating a lovely, nuanced young couple that is rooted in their individual and collective uniqueness. A fiercely strong debut for director Mendes."
"xenophil","3","2","3","14 November 1999"," Pretentious fraud
","This movie contains a number each of touching, funny, shocking, and brutally satirical scenes, all lovingly photographed and acted, from several incompatible movies that the director could have made.   The problem is, he never decided which one he was making.   Some of the ones he probably had in mind were Good Neighbor Sam, Ice Storm, and It's a Wonderful Life.<br/><br/>I don't usually get so bent out of shape when a movie has an inconsistent tone, or doesn't respect its characters, or goes for the feel-good copout, but this movie really made me mad, because it kept pretending to offer things that it never delivered - from the pretentious omniscient after-I-died birds-eye-view to the 'just joking' clue about who killed the guy in the end.   (I hope you all don't think this is a spoiler. Actually, I don't see how you can give a spoiler for this film, because although the opener is red herring, the real ending has no particular meaning or surprise to spoil.)<br/><br/>I suppose I should offer some justification for how much I hated this movie. Okay: 1) How warm and fuzzy should we feel about a statutory rapist, if he can't bring himself to deflower a virgin? 2) Do you think 'I was just joking' is a good way to resolve an outrageous teaser?   (How about ""and then I woke up""?) 3) Can you feel a good, warm-and-fuzzy 'go for it' kind of feeling about a guy who suddenly regresses to infantile behavior just when his wife and child really need him? 4) Do you really think that shouting, throwing food around and ruining the furniture is a good way to reestablish legitimate male authority in the family?   And that that's what women really want? 5) Do you really so jaded that adult sex won't do it for you, and you need to see teenage breasts?<br/><br/>Fine.   Here's your movie."

","It happens very rarely. You meet people in life who leave you with a lingering sense of familiarity. People, who no matter what they are, leave you with a sense of having asked a few questions; questions you have been wanting to ask yourself for a long time but have been putting it away simply because you don't want to face them. That's what happens when you start understanding the characters of `American Beauty'. It's like looking at the mirror and seeing someone you don't want to see, you don't want to know.<br/><br/>This film is an acknowledgement of our times; the pain and the curses that it bringsand the hope that it still instills in individual inspite of it. The story begins in a slow, casual narrative with a kind of indifference that makes it extremely tragic. But then as you zoom in to the lives of the characters you sense the dormant passions, the fears, the hope. Sam Mendes has done an excellent job in scattering a handful of characters in a plot where they are caught in the ebb and flow of life. Even if they run, they don't go very far, and finally come back to where they started. The background music complements the sensitive slowness of the film in a manner that is quite soulful. The camera acts almost like a silent observer and its role is, to have no role in the story. It just documents actions, reactions, emotions and feelings. In the noninterference of these other ingredients of film making, what gains poignance is the story, the plot, the lives of the characters. All the character in this film, the father, the mother, the daughter, her friend, the daughter's boyfriend, his father, his mother the neighbours  all of them are all caught in a society which has sapped their spirits in some way making them dysfunctional pieces of life. Life, which leaves no purpose, no meaning. It is a simple rambling on of mundane existence which one seldom questions. Yet one cant blame the society because what makes a society is the people. And one can't blame the people either. They are caught in such a black hole in time, which refuses to acknowledge them, as individuals with their individual preferences, which they can't live with, can't live without! The loveless marriage of Kevin Spacey, the stage of his life determining his need for a sensuous relationship if not a fruitful one, his life drifting away in front of him like he never belonged, his wife's new lover, his unhappy job situation, his lust for his daughter's friend are not connected events yet they have a bearing on each other leaving him no room for escape. Yet he tries to be an understanding father, a compromising husband, a faithful employee. He tries but fails. He is a guy I have seen next door, you have seen next door. He could be anywhere, but only in a time like this, when individualism has brought with it the bane of isolation. You empathize with him and wonder, `Haven't I ever felt this way?' And then when you see this man changingslowly but steadily transforming himself to what he would really like to be, you feel happy for him. He is beginning to understand his space in this world and Kevin Spacey does a wonderful job of portraying that transformation in the character. He has got into the character like it was he. The collage of the other characters brings out the fears, the insecurities, and the confusions that we live with. Annette Bennings' portrayal of the frustrated wife is absolutely fantastic. The character lives through her emotional outbursts, her rigorous routine life, her crippled relationship with her husband, and her unsatisfied professional life with such amazing chaos and yet it is so simple actually. It is so natural! Her internal traumas are well portrayed by the actress and you feel sorry for her even when you know she might have had a way out of the tragic situation she is in. Thora Birch is the absolute teenager. Caught between socially accepted concepts and her own self which does not fit in there, like any other teenager anywhere in the world in times like these she wonders whether she is a freak! Allison Janning and Chris Cooper are stunning in their short roles. They portray the senselessness of a system that breeds self-denial as part of societal ethics, some cope with it some take shelter in letting their minds wander. They are like two sides of a coin, so different from each other in dealing with truth yet so similar in what they are running away from.<br/><br/>Wes Butler as Ricky is perhaps the only one among the characters who has retained his sanity. His ability to see beauty in small, inane things surface so gently through the chaos in the film that one suddenly realizes what one is missing. It questions our inability to fathom darkness and touch light, our insufficiency to deal with our schizophrenic selves caught up in the mess of societal paradigms. He retains his individuality by being a part of a system that is rotting. In fact by helping the system to rot. His dealing in drugs thus becomes symbolic of a person who is helping a dying system die. He is abnormal. He does not fit in; perhaps that is his way of not conforming. But the most poignant part of the film is the end. When you see Lester's entire life pass through a haze of the present, you feel so completely awed at what beauty life actually holds for every one of us. As the glorious days of his childhood, the loving days of his marriage, his daughter float across his mind, and you hear him say how full of gratitude he is for all the wonder and beauty life actually has to offer, you just sit there in that balcony seat and shut your eyes for a second to glance into your soul. You wonder, `Why did all that laughter have to die?'"

","I know that American Beauty won the best picture Oscar in 1999, that being said, this movie has to be one of the WORST movies I have ever seen, it is quite hypocritical and left leaning, two things I hate most about films. It involves a man who is enduring a ""mid life crisis"" instead of taking responsibility for his life, he quits his job, makes his family life hell, and fantasizes over a teenage girl. (Is this guy a pediophile or something?!) The only ""normal"" people are a gay couple living next door. (The writer, Alan Ball, is openly gay so he wanted a black comedy with gay people in it!) Even the next door neighbor is shown as a sadistic bully! Anyways, the film shows how messed up our society is if we work hard to achieve the American dream. I didn't buy it, and found the whole movie to be a complete hypocritical mess. If you want to explore similar themes without the hypocrisy, go see 1999's Fight Club starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, which is ten times better than this OVERRATED mess. A one on a scale of 1-10."
"dibvallad","9","1","1","2 July 2020"," if a movie changes your life or the way you see it, it is said that it did a great job.
","...Although it took several years for me to watch this one, I only knew that when it finished, something had changed.<br/><br/>In American Beauty we follow Lester, a forty-year-old with an unhappy life disguised as being perfect with his wife Carolyn and daughter Jane, just the protagonist that the cinema tries to avoid in his productions being the lie of the American dream, looking as if he had In a coma all his life, he decides to erase the monotony of his existence when he meets Angela, Jane's friend, no matter who he takes between the forces of his chaos, he embarks on a journey on the way to his death.<br/><br/>What I am most passionate about seeing this film is the need to destroy the concept of American perfection and what surrounds it, drops of work, marriage, home and ideal work in a rain of real misery, to achieve this we see everything through Lester's eyes, the most indifferent of the tape about what his life is concerned, he says it himself ... ""I have lost something, I am not sure what it is but I know that I did not always feel so sedated"", this man He begins to change everything to recover what he lost trying to have fewer responsibilities, less work, focusing on himself to break the chains that enslave him, in the first half hour of the film we see how there are people who do not try to show that they are happy like Jane but on the other hand there are people who lock themselves in a bubble of perfection to represent a good image and reflect success, just what Carolyn does. We can see the real despair of people like Carolyn in the ""I'll sell this house today"" scene and the final collapse of not achieving it, showing that happiness is a mask that each one forges; the film manages to criticize this system of perfection but not with the desire to make it appear as incorrect or unfair, but it does it so that the audience sees the reaction of these characters to it, it gives us stereotyped characters but capable for the public to identify themselves with them even the most selfish, a man tired of his work (and his life itself), a woman who seems to have everything under control but in reality has no stability, a teenager indifferent to what surrounds her and who does not she likes herself. The characters in the film are profound, objective, out of place, but each one has their own story and are presented in the same way, in addition to the fact that their very existence makes them influence the story in a great way, even if they are not the protagonists, something almost impossible to see in the movies where they go in a story line and forget what is around, here we have characters like Ricky Fitts, a cold boy who knows how to appreciate real beauty, his father, a strict colonel who represses his interior, Angela, a rogue girl who avoids being ordinary and the cause of Lester's awakening, just waking up surprises the audience since we are talking about a love 20 years apart but to me it seems that the relationship of Lester and Angela goes beyond a romance forbidden by age but the insecurity of a teenager and the crisis of a 42-year-old man who seeks to regain youth and his surroundings.<br/><br/>I love to see how the film is not only supported by an ingenious story with deep characters and masterful performances such as the Spacey that won him the Oscar, but the photography manages to give careful and precise shots that give it a unique touch, characteristic symbols such as roses and the fullness of red throughout the film, which could well reflect the perfection of materialism and the lust of the characters.<br/><br/>The film is not perfect and it is what it wants, as an audience we are immersed in the voice-over of the catharsis of a man who, when he dies, embarks us to the beauty of life and his shipwreck, a portrait of society, to worry about what that people think and finally understand beauty, not the American one, but everything, including a plastic bag dancing in the air."
"Mad_alhnaki","10","1","1","21 June 2020"," A masterpiece
","One of the best movies in the 1990s. Kevin Spacey was spectacular. I liked Lester Burnham he was dark and genius. American Beauty is of course one of my favourite movies of all time"
"dr_clarke_2","10","1","1","21 June 2020"," An impressive cinema debut for director Sam Mendes
","When American Beauty won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1999 and numerous other accolades it was instantly hailed as a masterpiece and widely praised by critics and cinemagoers alike. In the two decades since it was released, its star has waned somewhat, with accusations that it was simply overrated when it was first released. But that's probably because it was over-analysed and over-scrutinised: it has aged well and remains an impressive cinema debut for director Sam Mendes.
Alan Ball's screenplay concerns a handful of characters living in an American suburb, and is focalised through Kevin Spacey's Lester Burnham, who narrates parts of the film. In a foreshadowing of the story's end, the story opens with Lester describing his death; aside from a deliberately misleading scene from the middle of the film at the very start, the plot has a linear narrative: once the scene in question is reached, it marks the beginning of Lester's final day on Earth. The plot is driven entirely by the interactions of the characters and has been subject to multiple interpretations, but it sees Lester deeply bored with his tedious suburban lifestyle and rebelling against it by blackmailing his boss, smoking dope with his neighbour's son, and fantasising about having sex with his daughter's friend Angela. It's often very funny, usually in a cringe-worthy way, for example when Lester is hopelessly besotted with Angela to the horror and embarrassment of his daughter Jane.
The characterisation is strikingly effective, from Lester, through his wife Carolyn and daughter Jane, to his uptight, repressed neighbour Frank Fitts and Frank's rebellious drug-dealing son Ricky. Every character is inherently flawed, which is used to generate both drama and humour; the only characters who seem content with their lot are Jim and Jim, a seemingly happy and well balanced suburban couple who are atypical only in the fact that they are gay. Towards the end of the film, Angela says ""I don't think there's anything worse than being ordinary"", which is arguably the film's point.
The casting is perfect, with Spacey giving a typically brilliant performance that conveys Lester's sheer boredom with his life perfectly: his face lights up when he first meets Angela, and again later when Ricky offers him a joint. Annette Bening is just as good as Carolyn, who finds her own freedom by having an affair but is mortified when Lester finds out about it, thus shattering her carefully cultivated image as part of the perfect suburban couple. Chris Cooper is astounding as Frank, and once you know that the character is a repressed homosexual, watching the film again reveals whole extra depths to Cooper's performance. During the scene in which a tormented Frank approaches Lester and kisses him, having completely failed to understand the situation, Cooper's expression says far more about what Frank is thinking than his sparse dialogue. In the face of such strong competition, then relative newcomer Wes Bentley almost steals the show as the complex Ricky.
Conrad L. Hall's cinematography is crucial to the film's success, and his dynamic camerawork lends itself well to the ingenious editing by Tariq Anwar and Christopher Greenbury: the iconic first fantasy scene of Lester imagining Angela naked but for the red rose petals is a perfect example. Close-ups and slow motion are used with surgical precision. Thomas Newman's often subtle, often whimsical soundtrack perfectly suits the film's mood and includes perfectly placed diagetic music at key points.
American Beauty may not be held in quite the high regard it once was, and in its blistering satire of American family life it is perhaps a product of its time. But even at its very worst, it's still enormously entertaining, endlessly interesting and brilliantly made, and those reasons are more than enough to make it worth watching."
"iccmulan","8","1","1","18 June 2020"," Excellent
","When I first saw this movie in theaters, I found it to be very funny. When I rented it at home, I found it to be very sad and complex. Looking at it now, I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood. To some it may look trite or cliched, or maybe too un-ordinary to be worthy of its praise, but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful. After you've seen it, you know you've seen something.<br/><br/>A few notable elements stand out. The direction is superb; this is visually a superior film, for the director understands the subtle changes in tone. The writing is equally compelling; the story effortlessly interweaves multiple stories to create one amazing movie. The haunting music is also notable. Lastly is the acting. Kevin Spacey has done excellent films before, and he can add this one to the list. He may be a little to witty to suggest the overshadowed character he portrays, but he simply disappears into the role. Annette Bening is also fine; a less strong role, but she is magnificent none the less. As the teenagers, Thora Birch is able to mesmerize us with one intense look; her ""typical teenager"" role is fleshed out completely. I enjoyed Mena Suvari's character equally. It seemed that she did not receive as much acclaim, but her performance evokes both innocence and experience, and her scenes toward the end give her a depth unlike any other character. And Wes Bentley, as the video-taping boy next door, is easily the most original character. At first he seems a little tense, but, like Spacey, he sinks into the role. His ""purpose"" in the film, unlike anyone else's, is a mystery, thus making him the most enigmatic person.<br/><br/>Most films are able to make a lasting impression on its audience, but never has a movie been known to ""move"" its viewers as much as this movie. It truly says something about life, no matter how predictable or tacky it appears, this film disturbingly shows us how to appreciate our individual lives, so therefore, when they are over, we each have something to remember."

"aidanratesmovies","10","1","1","4 June 2020"," Perfect, in every sense of the word
","If I had to describe this film in one word, it would be 'brilliant.' Nothing has truly captured the mundane and inner thoughts and demons surrounding people and their human natures quite like this before, nor has any film been able to play it off in such a unique manner. It's a timeless film that somehow manages to be incredibly insightful, without ever feeling a slight bit dull or boring. It's interesting, entertaining, cleverly shot, well written, and fantastically acted. There is little to say the film didn't do right. Kevin Spacey gives one of, if not, the best performance of his career and he is well deserving of his Oscar win. His portrayal of the character Lester Burnham can often be imitated in many aspiring filmmakers works today, but even though it is often imitated, none can replicate the brilliance that Spacey puts into the performance. His acting is not only realistic, but also endlessly enjoyable to watch, and you won't want to take your eyes off the screen when he steals every scene he possibly can. The other actors in the film are quite great as well. Annette Bening gives a wonderfully poignant performance as Carolyn Burnham and provides a greater glimpse into the struggling suburban wife we have all come to know at some point in our lives. Her performance isn't just an advance on a stereotype however, and neither is the character, but rather a fresh perspective on how someone so mundane and yet trouble-filled can be living throughout their own life. Though no performance in the film shine quite as notably as these two; Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari, and Chris Cooper all give quite notable performances on their own- with somewhat less screen time to let their roles shine. The film is written beautifully, and its incite and story is so incredibly down to earth- and yet so wonderfully magical all at once. It's direction is perfect, with it being Mendes' first effort, it truly shows how impressive he is as a filmmaker. The film is also shot beautifully, and is well deserved of its Oscar win for cinematography, with its endlessly perfect and interesting shots that truly help the film to keep up its amazing stature. The one flaw I can see the film being ridiculed for, is it being slightly predictable at times, but even with this small flaw- American Beauty seems to make it not just a flaw but a quirk of its story- by providing such realistic values and lifelike scenarios- that you can't help but feel like if you were in the same situation, you could predict it yourself. In the end, American Beauty is a timeless effort from all those involved- filled with some wonderful writing by Alan Ball and wonderful direction from Sam Mendes. Spacey's performance, as is the film, is timeless and all in all both go in my personal favorite moments in all of film history.

"heyimmyx","10","1","1","14 May 2020"," Immy's review : One of my favourite movies
","What a masterpiece.
American beauty appears to be an exploration of the dynamics of a regular suburban family, however at heart it's a brutally honest commentary on society and how social expectations morph us into how we are expected to live and act. We become obsessed with the idea of finding happiness through materialism, riches, and what we are taught will make us happy, however this never ends up being the case.
Lester is the lead character here. Having been in a dormant marriage for years and barely speaking with his stroppy teen daughter, he is greatly unhappy and misses his younger days, so sets about expressing how he actually feels and finally gives into his desires he had suppressed for so long, one of them being starting a love affair with his daughters best friend.
The movie is exceptional at turning the infamous 'Mid life crisis' into something that shouldn't be frowned upon as a sign of human weakness, but more of a humans natural reaction from an oppressive system. Lester, and later his wife Angela, finally break free from all the pressures pushed onto them. Lester quits his job and starts smoking pot, whereas Angela begins a tumultuous affair, and through this we see her stiff character become more carefree, and Lester more confident. Eventually, however, Lester finally comes to see the 'beauty' of life for what it is, and that there's so much more to life than trying to obtain materialism. There's just beauty in what's there.
I adore the movie's complex and various different themes, including sexuality, family, materialism, love and conformity. Every character symbolised one of these themes and also some part of us as humans. Carolyn portraying the image and perfection obsessed wife, Lester the guy seeking freedom and youth again, Jane the self loathing daughter with low self esteem, Angela the self obsessed girl constantly seeking attention from guys (and arguably also suffering from low self esteem), Ricky the guy who saw the beauty in everyday life (him being the idealised version of where we should be) and his father Frank's violent and angry nature (which we come to learn is to cover his biggest insecurity). The symbolism portrayed through these characters is what makes this movie so relatable and moving.
My favourite scene is when Ricky shows Jane his video footage of a plastic bag floating in circles through the wind, never quite stopping, in which he remarks 'sometimes theres so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it'. Ricky truly symbolises a person who has found complete happinesses in the everyday things despite his strict father. He doesn't see beauty in materialism, but beauty in things where you least expect it.
Another theme I found particularly interesting was the idea of masculinity, and men repressing their emotions and desires, conveyed by the strict and homophobic Frank. It paints an accurate portrayal of the 'toxic masculinity' trope and how these ideas have affected men for thousands of years, leading them to, in general, develop a more violent and angry nature because of society's forced repression of their feelings.
I felt particularly drawn to Angela, as under her looks and apparent confidence was a young and insecure girl who thought that looking pretty and appearing desirable to boys was the key to happiness, however we don't really believe she is, and that's what is so engaging about the movie. It focuses on the characters flaws so we see them for who they really are, and in a sense we see their flaws in us.
The cinematography was beautiful, with the wide range of colours being hugely symbolic throughout. It almost felt like a classical 1950s movie in certain places to portray the idea of a 'Pleasantville' and the 'suburban dream'.
Overall, a beautiful and life changing movie, that might make you think a little about true beauty and happiness."

This is the Best of the 1990's and that decade had a lot of great movies came out( Goodfellas, L.A Confedintil, Pulp Fiction to name a few).

Weird film, with Kevin Spacey being the only character in the play that played more as a comedian and much less as a drama, an element that sealed the film's weird character. The film is powerful, a mirror of relationships in a modern family. A family broken up inside, where its members seek communication, joy, love, esteem, outside the family context. Just the opposite of what the family window showcases, that is. And all this is embedded in the social context, with its anchors, its distortions, its exaggerations, its impositions, but also its instability. To conclude that the family self-destructs itself, which is ultimately the only element on which she could find support."

","I decided to watch American Beauty again to see whether my initial rating of 9 would hold up after all of these years. And it does! The work is exquisitely crafted but also manages to walk a fine line between cynicism and hope, which is a rare feat indeed.<br/><br/>Lots of topics are broached here and some will certainly offend some viewers--especially the derogatory depiction of a military family--but as a record of the twentieth-century suburbs, American Beauty no doubt hits home with the many people who grew up in neighborhoods just like Lester´s, peopled with families just like his, with children who attend schools just like his daughter´s, and who had ¨friends¨ just like hers.<br/><br/>Given all of the many plot strands, it is something of a miracle that the director (Sam Mendes) managed to pull this off, and all the more, given that this was his debut. Yet he did. American Beauty richly deserves the acolades heaped upon it and is a true example of tragicomedy for the modern world."

","Age 16, this was one of my first experiences of cinematic depth containing such emotion and meaning that I could share with no one I personally knew. I remember choosing this movie to go see with my high school girlfriend and her cousin. I can say without a doubt that this movie had a direct influence on a good bit of my life, some good, some bad (though it was common sense relatable to most and to my acknowledgment, went to my head, but as I said, I was young and an idealist...<br/><br/>still am in the heart.)<br/><br/>I don't know what exactly went on with Spacey these past years what exactly what he did but his performance in this film and some others as well made him one of my favorite actors of all time. Wes Bently as the next-door teenaged neighbor was good as well and I thought it looked promising that he would have a pretty big career but that was a misfire on my end. Anyway, all performances were pretty stellar and some were very surprisingly comedic, with a very intellectual screenplay by Alan Ball, along with some daring and bold direction from Sam Mendes, American Beauty is, well, I will put it this way...<br/><br/>When someone asks me what my true favorites are, I think of maybe 4, 5 right away and then instantly after that, American Beauty is where my heart, mind, and feeling instinctive, without choice, go to.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, I thought the bag scene was really heartfelt and meaningful and **there is just a hands down great topless shot of Thora Birch (Who knew?!)

"trey-yancy-572-763547","10","1","1","4 January 2020"," A disturbing abstraction
","This is art that presents a stark and disturbing image. It is most definitely not a film for the average audience and those who pan this film all say more or less the same thing, which when translated into the absolute basics is that they didn't get it. There's no reason why they should. This film is not for them.<br/><br/>For those of us who have had to deal with extreme relationships and who have had to deal with blind, angry, people whose existence is intractably anchored to things that are ultimately meaningless, this film most definitely strikes home. The challenge is to be able to extract yourself from such dysfunctional people before you yourself are destroyed by it. Spacey's character is that person - destroyed by the soullessness but with a tiny, if perverse, ray of hope.<br/><br/>Some get this film. Other do not. It's up to the viewer. My rating is not based on the notion that it makes me happy or fulfilled, or anything like this. I rate the film on what it is, what it does, and how successful it is at doing it. If a person leaves the theater feeling torn-up, that is the point. It is intended to make the viewer take a look at their own life, to recognize the artificialities, and to extricate themselves from this."

","I just read a long review of ""American Beauty"" on Wikipedia and it stated that film critics' opinions of it had declined over time, and that it was ""overpraised"" when it was released. I cannot agree.<br/><br/>This film is deeply philosophical - it is about ""the meaning of life,"" with particular attention on the lives of middle-aged, middle-class adults and their teenaged children. ""American Beauty"" is also very funny, in a sarcastic, dark comedy manner, that I find very appealing. How many films have you seen there the ""narrator"" who introduces the film, and concludes it, tells you he is dead, but that this is not important to the story he has to tell.<br/><br/>By the way, Wikipedia did not note this key fact: the ""American Beauty Rose"" the hybrid flower that is displayed symbolically throughout the film is known to be very beautiful, but it is also prone to infestation by fungus so it often has a very bad smell. Even a flower can be ironic."
"jghbrown","7","1","1","17 October 2019"," An average review
","As of now there are almost as many reviews on this site for this movie as for ""The Godfather"". Yet, you may have noticed that they are sharply divided (in the main) between those who love it and those who hate it. It would make an interesting PhD study to investigate the reasons why this is.<br/><br/>Me, I'm going to go for average. For sure, the movie is not as profound as it seems to suggest. There is, of course, a great deal of beauty in the world about us. Yet there is also a great deal of ugliness. It's important to know the difference between the two, I believe. One should love but one should also feel anger.<br/><br/>All the characters depicted in it have their flaws, apart, perhaps, from the gay couple, whom we never get to know much about. The central character, whose ""flashback"" we are watching, is Lester Burnham, played brilliantly by Kevin Spacey.<br/><br/>Lester is by no means perfect. For one thing, he is immature, perhaps even irresponsible. If he is angry, it's seldom directed into something worthwhile. He enjoys winding his wife up when he isn't sipping a beer, or smoking dope, or fantasizing about his daughter's best friend. Yet there is a sort of guileless honesty about him, a likeable charm, a flash of childish insurrection, which appealed to me and perhaps does to others. In short, he seems somewhat human, at least by comparison to the others. He is the worm that turned, though in truth he is still mostly a worm.<br/><br/>Lester is concerned that people are treating him as though he didn't exist. This touches on one of the major themes of the movie - connectivity. In the rush to live our modern lives we are losing touch with each other and to the natural world. Lester wants to go back to the time when his family were all connected, and he spends a lot of time gazing at a photograph which depicts it.<br/><br/>His wife Carolyn, playing equally brilliantly by Annette Bening, is a sexually frustrated go-getter (in a business sense). There is little doubt that she is ""the boss"", a fact which Lester resents (and, like many schoolkids awed by teacher, does whatever he can to irritate her). There is also little doubt that she has completely lost contact with her own family. She charges on, like Liberty leading the people, towards destinations and battlefields unknown. On the way she manages to get hold of a gun, which makes a lot of noise (well, it scared my cat) and looks dangerous.<br/><br/>Sullen, sulky Jane - the daughter (played by Thora Birch) - apparently hates her parents (and possibly most other people). Though a Freudian slip she makes suggests that she actually is fond of Lester but resents the fact that he pays so little attention to her (as opposed to the time he spends salivating over her best friend). At any rate, she too feels isolated.<br/><br/>The only other person I'll mention is Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), the new next-door neighbour with a fancy camera and a shrewd business sense for dealing in dope. You could call him ""Mr Connectivity"" since he seems to have the knack for finding beauty in almost everything, even Jane (and a plastic bag which dances provocatively in the wind). He has a strong influence on both Lester and Jane.<br/><br/>There you have it. People caught up in the whirlwind of life and in dire need of re-connecting. Not a hugely original theme (compare with Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol""), but an important one nevertheless, and handled with considerable humour. Oh, and girls wallowing naked in rose petals. Seven out of ten."

","My biggest fear before watching this movie was that I felt I was going to be unsatisfied with the product, I mean American beauty is considered the best movie of 1999 and hell some say of all time. I'm happy to say that did not happen, yes American beauty is a masterpiece in its own right
The brilliant direction by Sam Mendes and permanence from Kevin Spacey (less we forget) is really what pulls it together. The dialogue was also fantastic and had me laughing at several moments ( seriously that dinner scene after spacey quits his job is absolutely hilarious).
Honestly my biggest problem of the film was the whole 'Spacey's character is going to die at the end' draw. It felt unnecessary in the theme of the plot, the ending voice over of spacey talking about his life felt quite out of place honestly.
Regardless, you should check it out, this film is only a hair away from being a perfect 10 in my eyes. Maybe you'll love it even more"

In part because it's not a complete downer and in part because it doesn't cheat the audience, American Beauty is emotionally satisfying. There's a sense of poignancy at the end, but also the feeling that we have been on an incredible trip through the lives and souls of three perfectly-realized characters. In a year that boasts few truly memorable motion pictures, Mendes can stake a claim alongside the likes of Kubrick and Egoyan as one whose cinematic vision both challenges and entertains."

The film is extremely well made with excellent cinematography, storytelling, direction and acting. The themes of dysfunction in suburbia are still relevant and American Beauty was an excellent social commentary/satire that is very engaging and well executed. The dialouge is clever and the film is equally effective with its more serious, tragic scenes as well as really funny in the more humorous ones. Say what you want about Kevin Spacey, but his skills as an actor can't be diminished. He is brilliant in this and this is one of the best films of its time.

It's an experience that will stay with you long after the credits roll. The fantastic screenplay mixes with the amazing acting to create a seamless sort of 'imagined realism' that allows for a true cinematic reflection of real life.

"OnlineObserver","10","1","1","16 December 2017"," I thank this film for inspiring the series ""Desperate Housewives"". A drama that shows life go from bad to worse!
","I had actually seen the series ""Desperate Housewives"" first and I always wondered where the unique directing style and perception on day to day life, household dynamics and social interactions between loved ones, friends and strangers, had come from. When I sat down to watch this film, I slowly noticed similarities between the series ""Desperate Housewives"" and this film.<br/><br/>The film ""American Beauty"" follows the lives of normal families living in one neighborhood and throughout the film, you get to see each family deal with their own problems as families and as individuals. <br/><br/>The film starts off with comedy and denial, and as the film continues on, you can slowly start to see each individual person start to break out of their own restricted life situations and this causes bigger problems and eventually the film ends with a climax where selfishness, self loathing, arrogance, lack of appreciation and desperation takes over and even results in the worst kinda of situation imaginable in what seems to be a normal neighborhood.<br/><br/>For me personally, I think this film is subtly showing how any human being, if they are restricted, push boundaries. If they are unappreciated, they develop feelings of worthlessness. If they are arrogant, then it might be because they are over compensating for a fragile ego. If they are selfish, it might be because they are desperate to get what they want, because in life, they are not getting something that they truly need and if they are desperate, then they can be capable of the most underhanded, extreme and shocking acts! <br/><br/>Human beings can only be pushed so far and I think if we are all pushed too far, then it becomes dangerous and this film clearly shows how any one is capable of anything!"

","While American Beauty seems to have lost the punch it once had, there are still aspects of the film that hold true. The psychology of the film, through the eyes of each of its characters, is insightful and intriguing. There are aspects of each character that are relatable: the desire to live, to be seen and understood, to succeed, to be desired, and so on.<br/><br/>The story, as told by a now dead Lester (Kevin Spacey), explores the mundane, and the natural desire to escape it, be something more and break free from the expectations of society. Spacey has lost all passion in his life. He feels smothered by his job, his family, and whatever few other aspects remain of his life after those.<br/><br/>His passion is reignited by Angela, his daughter's school friend; a girl half his age. This new vigor sets him on a new path in which he starts working out, smoking pot, quits his cushy job for one at a fast food joint, buys a flashy new car, and stops caring what everyone else thinks about him in general.<br/><br/>He observes in the beginning of the film that his wife is no longer happy. You can see this, not only in the way she interacts with Lester, but with her daughter and neighbors, and the way she prioritizes her job and possessions over relationships. She, like Lester, seems stuck in a societal hole that she feels trapped within. Her supposed salvation comes in the form of her work rival, with whom she has a passionate affair. She loves, she loses, she falls back into her hole. Her big moment in this film, in my opinion, came in the final scenes, where we make a very realistic discovery. Although the passion had gone out in their relationship, and although she was looking for love in other places, in the end, she still loved Lester in her way, which makes his death all the more tragic. <br/><br/>Then, we have Chris Cooper, who plays Colonel Fits. Fits spends the film in a state of aggression due to his repressed sexuality. Society has told him his whole life that what he feels in this regard is wrong, and so his guilt displays itself in his anger and disconnect with those to whom ought to be closest. Because his arc is never completed, his story ends violently as he sinks back into his repressed and 'acceptable' state. Cooper gives one of the best performances in the movie, second only to Spacey. You can actually feel the struggle raging inside him throughout the film, making his actions at the end terrible but heartbreaking at the same time.<br/><br/>Finally, Angela is the last compelling character in the film. Although I don't personally identify with all aspects of the character, she is the most relatable in terms of the three kids. She feels things the way normal people do. She wants to be special, seen, and desired. As she said in the film, the worst thing to be, in her eyes, is ordinary.<br/><br/>Jane and Ricky on the other hand, the demographic with whom I'm supposed to relate, are incredibly weak characters. Throughout the film, I found them pretentious and annoying. This is especially disheartening, because, as a whole, all the characters in this film are after the same thing: self-actualization and fulfillment. The reason I find this annoying is because the character who has supposedly achieved these goals is the most pretentious and emotionless character in the film... to the point where I'm almost suspicious that he may be a serial killer. I'm afraid that if the daughter does end up running off with him, that she may never be found again. Just putting that out there.<br/><br/>That being said, the rest of the film was captivating. The way the director told the story of emotional transformation through the color red was beautiful. I love the subtle but powerful details of this choice. The red door, the red car, how the characters wear red when pursuing their passion, blood splattered across the bleach white room. All in all, I can only recommend this film. Yes the subject matter and zeitgeist is a little dated now, but the emotional and psychological content is still pertinent almost 20 years later. 7/10"

Annette Benning here gives a solid performance - of its best I would say - like a hysterical, suburban, materialist wife. Mena Suvari in the role of adolescent attention whore, a permanent victim of her beauty and admiration by everyone - a classic portrayal of American dream for teen girls. Wes Bentley gives a performance of his lifetime, in the role that reminds someone like psycho, weirdo, pedophile, satanist, cult member, stalker, possible serial killer.Chris Cooper is great in the role of homophobic veteran, repressed homosexual who is driven to crime.The most shocking performance is Alisson's Janney heartbreaking silence in an almost catatonic state.Wonderful depiction of middle class, middle-age, suburban American dream drama.

How a boring film that has nothing to offer but pretense makes it this far is a complete mystery to me. Its industry popularity and critical acclaim is utterly astounding to me.  <br/><br/>        No doubt Kevin Spacey is a fine actor, but the 2000 best actor Oscar if there really is one, clearly belonged to Denzel Washington for HURRICANE.	<br/><br/>	Here, we see visuals that have no real meaning but are conjured for effect that simply deepens the meandering. We hear meaningless dialog that is nothing more than teenage angst.         This hodgepodge is nothing but a mishmash of oddball, misfiring scenes altogether not making a half-baked B-film scenario.

"Ruby-30","3","1","1","26 March 2000"," American Beauty - this film was very disappointing. It was far too transparent and predictable.
","For those of you that think this is the best film you have ever seen, you need to expand your narrow view of the cinematic world. In fact try reading some books, for instance Winesburg Ohio by Sherwood Anderson.<br/><br/>The story line in American Beauty was far from original, and the characters were tired stereotypes living the 'American Dream'. The symbols used were trite and obvious, for instance the dead dove (need I explain) and the rose petals on a virgin (they even had to tell you that later). Angela's 'deflowering' that never happened was possibly the most sensitive moment in the film, when Lester realised that she was just a little girl, and that his fantasy was just an outlet for his deep insecurities.<br/><br/>The film is about the fear and mystery surrounding death, although I feel it was trying to be about something else, which never really becomes apparent. Our fear and curiosity of death is what draws the audience. But Jane, Lester's daughter, saying that she would like Ricky to kill her father draws the audience into the film on completely false pretences, as we later find that she was 'only joking'. You should never deceive your audience.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey speaks to you at the end of the film, reminding you that you too will die one day - see what I mean? We are fascinated by ourselves and how we will die. Thats why we watch a film like this till the end, to see how he dies, it is almost irrelevant who kills him. The lame plot that surfaces - the fact that several of them want him dead, should have been cut out. It doesn't mean anything.<br/><br/>Enough films deconstructing the 'American Dream' thank you. Surely the fact that yet another has been made to such great acclaim is the irony here."
"cinesin","3","1","1","26 March 2000"," Beauty?? Where, what, and whom?
","Having seen 'American Beauty' only hours ago - I am left wondering what all the fuss is about. The film is pleasant in a passable glory but too much more cannot be said about the quality of the film.<br/><br/>Films are about stories and this film is constructed on a predictable and shallow script. The social issues concerned lack any psychological depth and it that way could easily pass for an NBC Today news item.<br/><br/>
I like Kevin Spacey (although less so from his arrogant interview on 60 minutes) but at times his portrayal of Lester was irritating.<br/><br/>Annette Benning is wonderful but her character never really explored the depths of her psyche. In this sense, she is essentially seen as the cause of Lester's problems and not the other way around (except for the last 10 minutes).<br/><br/>If you really want to see a social commentary on suburban life I suggest you see: 'The Ice Storm' or 'All that Heaven Allows'. As for the 'Melrose factor' of bitchiness - go see 'War of the Roses'. Otherwise you could turn to a seven-year old for whatever 'American Beauty' has to offer. <br/><br/>Too much hype and a weak script. Overall rating = pleasant."
"conono","3","1","1","9 March 2000"," Skillfully made film hampered by sophomoric writing...
","""American Beauty"" is better in its execution than in its conception. Ostensibly showing us the seamy underside of suburban life, and despite excellent performances from all its leads, the film instead presents a slightly sophomoric take along the lines of ""What's Wrong with My Parents"". Clearly, here's a movie imagined as subversive while actually being quite conventional.  This, in simple terms, is why it's the Oscar favorite for best film.<br/><br/>The film is not afraid to traffic heavily in tired Hollywood stereotypes: mid-life crisis; the seething frustrations of a middle-aged married couple who have grown apart; the overfriendly gay professional neighbors who present welcome baskets to new neighbors but bicker with each other, all the while staying in great shape through rigorous workouts; the hard-nosed, intolerant military officer.<br/><br/>But a lot can be forgiven when the filmmaker's still in his twenties.  The film, obsessed with showing us overlooked beauty in life's simplest things, actually succeeds here and there, and has a lively pace that slows appropriately when needed.  It's also obsessed with sex (and 'adult' enough about it that I was sorry to see so many kids in the cinema).  Still the director, and not the writer, deserves the credit for what's good about ""American Beauty"".  Despite ample foreshadowing, the Hollywood (not to say ""upbeat"") ending is quite contrived."

One aspect of the movie that hasn't been mentioned by others is the soundtrack which added tremendously to the emotional impact of the story. It was at the same time both understated and powerful.  Now I will have to go back and see other movies for which Thomas Newman wrote the score -- such as Three Kings, Oscar & Lucinda, Phenomenon, Little Women, Shawshank Redemption, Fried Green Tomatoes, Scent of a Woman...  It truly would not have been the same movie without this unusual score."

I felt I'd seen most of the themes explored (written) better in other movies (Hurley Burley comes to mind).

Chris Cooper really grabbed the screen as the all American military man raging against a morally declining world which he cannot save/help despite has vain efforts. <br/><br/>There are some funny moments; there was gentle laughter here and there, but I got the feeling the audience couldn't decide whether to laugh, wince or squirm.

","By reading the comments that have been posted on and about this movie, one would assume going in to expect, perhaps, a new ""Citizen Kane,"" ""The Godfather,"" ""Braveheart,"" some type of new form of film that would inspire. Rather, it is merely a new director's attempt to run mainstream film noir by using contemporary debates.<br/><br/>The film is centered around the character played by Spacey as a management level, middle-aged man, working his way through a mid-life crisis.  His wife, Bening, is focused completely on her job and gives and takes everything within the family.  Rounding out the family is a teenager who seems to be a normal teenager by today's standards; moody, unstable and on drugs.<br/><br/>The film follows one year of theirs lives and the interactions, which are lengthy and very withdrawn.  It seems that Bening read the script the morning of filming and her mind was elsewhere.  Spacey plays his role well; unfortunately the role is written poorly and gives off a horrible sense of his having to adapt to this throughout the movie.<br/><br/>To judge this film as ""one of the year's best"" is extremely narrow minded. It seems that every film totes a ""thumbs-up"" on their trailers but few live up to these prophecies; this is no exception.  American Beauty is rather Ugly."

","The tagline for AMERICAN BEAUTY sums up the whole two hours in two words. Look closer.<br/><br/>When we first see the suburb where most of the action takes place, the camera looks to be mounted on a helicopter.  It glides along the tree lined streets.<br/><br/>There's one house in particular where most of the action takes place.  From the outside all is normal and nice.  This could be a neighborhood from OZZIE AND HARRIET or FATHER KNOWS BEST.  Look at the family living in the house with the red door.  A man who works in advertising.  His wife who sells real estate.  His beautiful daughter.  Look closer.<br/><br/>These people are estranged from each other and, worst of all, from themselves.  At the risk of lapsing into jargon, their authentic selves have long since been abandoned.  Look closer.<br/><br/>These are three desperately lonely people.  On the one hand, the movie is hilarious.  There is wild humor here that reminds you of WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF and THE GRADUATE.  But these people are dying inside.<br/><br/>The father becomes infatuated with a girl who's in the high school drill team with his daughter.  She's a blonde beauty who's got ambitions of being a model.  She seems tough as nails and ready to do anything to get what she wants.  Look closer.<br/><br/>The family next door is even more bizarre.  The father is a homophobic, self-righteous retired military officer.  The mother seems terrified out of her wits and is in a zombie-like state.  Their son is involved with drugs. He keeps reality at a distance by videotaping everything.  He has a hauntingly beautiful tape of a plastic bag being blown by the wind that I could have watched for hours.  When he gets involved with the girl from next door, we're sure that we know what's going to happen next.  Look closer.<br/><br/>If the movie has a fault, it's that it's too short.  There are about a dozen characters we'd like to see examined in more depth.<br/><br/>Watching this, I marveled at how comparatively normal my own life really is. Teenagers can watch this movie and come away thinking that maybe their parents aren't really all that weird after all :-)<br/><br/>An important point to ponder, though.  The characters in this story didn't come to these points in their lives overnight.  Everything that's gone wrong went wrong through a slow process over the years.<br/><br/>Every person who sees AMERICAN BEAUTY will come away saying, well, that's not my life.  That was interesting but it couldn't happen in my state, my town, my neighborhood, my house.  Look closer."

","This movie is about a bunch of mental misfits and whiny cry babies who think that if they are not totally happy then they have the absolute right to act in anyway they want no matter the damage it does to others. The main characters all behave in vulgar ways that are not acceptable in any circles I am familiar with.<br/><br/>With a couple of exceptions, the characters are written and performed as caricatures with Annette Benings' portrayal being cartoonish. None of the main characters are likeable in the least and I wouldn't be interested in spending any appreciable amount of time with any of them.<br/><br/>In addition to the above complaints, there is the kiddie porn aspect. Kevin Spacey's character lusts after a high school girl. The actress may be of age but certainly doesn't look it. The actress playing his daughter does a topless scene and she (the actress) was only 16 when the movie was being shot.<br/><br/>
Hollywood has made great strides here to advance the anti-family agenda. The most sympathetic characters in order are 1.the gay couple 2. the daughter of the dysfunctional family 3. the family man, who hasn't been invested in his family for 20 years and suddenly chucks everything so he can work out to get in shape to impress a teenager and smoke pot 4. the boy next door who secretly tapes everything and everyone and makes a tidy sum selling pot.<br/><br/>The least sympathetic characters are the Marine Colonel who is shown as a brutish, self-loathing gay and the wife of the man in midlife crisis who is shown as a cartoonish real estate broker.<br/><br/>This movie stinks to high heaven. I rated it a 2 only because it had a couple of funny lines that made me laugh before I started disliking it."

It claims to be a black comedy, but it isnt funny (try fight club instead) and is basically dead boring. It is provocative (if that's what you call 'bending the conventions' as many reviewers mentioned), but this doesn't make it a good story - it makes it seem ridiculous. Kevin Spacey as usual is brilliant, making the best of an awful story, and Annette Bening is totally excessive. The other actors are nothing to write home about, except the boy next door (forget the actors name) who has some screen presence, but his character seems to confuse this.

","I went to bed after seeing this film with a rather confused feeling: I was unsure as to whether to assess the film from a purely intellectual point of view, or from a more mundane attitude, that is, to judge it for what it was rather than what it might have purported to be. Or perhaps I just thought I had missed something as it just did not seem to be worthy of five Oscars, or even one if you push me. I mean, what do you have? A rather ordinary family living a rather ordinary if disfunctional life with a rather hysterical mother/wife failing as both, who could not sell a pair of socks in a street-market, let alone real estate; added to which we have an even more disfunctional family as new neighbours with a son who makes a lot of money selling dope and filming anything and anybody and a father who is a right jerk. Most of the dialogues sounded wooden; there was no naturalness; it all came out very much too rehearsed.<br/><br/>I fear the myth-making Hollywood tradition has fed us pseudo-intellectual interpretations or reading between the lines in that great endeavour to create a cult movie; but this time it just does not come off; this film is a howler; only the most naïve could possibly swallow the supposed greatness to be found here.<br/><br/>Whether this film could possibly be indicative of normal American family situations (which would mean that the USA is very sick indeed) or whether real people out there can really identify with such characters and situations (which would also indicate the same thing), is totally beyond me.<br/><br/>A message to those who organise the Oscar charade: if there are not enough good pictures to give Oscars for, leave them void instead of showering them on films which are just not worthy of them. American Beauty is a beauty: it has kidded a whole lot of people. But remember, you can't fool all the people all the time; you can only fool some of the people some of the time.<br/><br/>Having said that, I might just run down a few of the commentaries for this film; I never do so before writing my little piece for any film."
"tommyboy-16","3","1","1","14 January 2001"," a real HORROR flick
","A true horror film. Why? Because these monsters are real! This film is a reflection of our society. The reflection is real and greatly magnified. Mirror, mirror on the wall who is the most screwed up of all. `American Beauty' answers such a question quite well and I don' t find it very entertaining. Movies that I like make me think, laugh, cry, or be p***ed off, but this one drains the dopamine out of my nerve centers. Its another depressing movie that Hollywood uses to promote cynicism of the American dream and to stereotype suburbia. The movie portrays middle class as mean spirited, oppressed, unfaithful, fake, hypocritical, gun toten homophobes who would pluck the gold from your molars before the ink dried on your death certificate. Its not by accident that liberal Hollywood depicts in this film a gay couple as the happiest, healthiest, friendliest and most wholesome of the entire neighborhood while attempting to portray a Norman Rockwell lifestyle as a bogus facsimile of an old American fantasy.<br/><br/>However,this movie does pack a powerful punch. It has great acting by Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, and Wes Bentley. It has a plot that is very artistically twisted (just like the characters).  It has an ending that surprises the viewer. It also has a smorgasbord of society's issues that many can dip onto their plate and relate to.  Lets see a sample of the main entrees: We have unfaithful spouses, mid life crisis, large portions of depression, freshly stewed low self esteem, and hot off the grill anger. It also has a very delectable side bar of tasty morsels: It serves up closet homosexuals and out of the closet homosexuals, drug addiction, murder, money and power struggles,  hard headed, violent and bigoted military figures, teenage identity crisis. And for dessert: Lets try some 17 year old breast, a woman's feet flying up in the air, sexual fantasies, a man jerking off in the shower and a mild twist of humor for flavoring. Uhmmmm ! Sounds good? Not to this movie watcher. Belch!!  Where are the `Tums'?  I didn't escape in this movie; I was sucked into this movie like a farmer pulled into a corn picker and maimed from the inside out. I see so much pain in this movie and we all grow numb of it. I found the world news more refreshing. What a downer.<br/><br/>I gave this movie an anemic 6. It is greatly overrated and I hope not a classic. If it becomes a classic I fear what we have become as a whole. Its another flick that I am amazed at the amount of high scores. Maybe that proves the old saying that misery loves company. I called this a horror movie, but a disaster movie may be a more realistic classification.  It should be called `Erosion'. Erosion of society, the American dream, and family values and gives power to pursuing ones desires first while putting everyone close to you in the shadows. I once watched a movie that reflected a part of America called, `The Grapes of Wrath'. It made me very grateful of where we have come and this one `American Beauty' makes fearful of where we are going."

","I reserved my opinion as to whether Saving Private Ryan got cheated out of Best Picture until I saw American Beauty. Now I can absolutely say that they did.<br/><br/>I was about halfway through this movie and wondered if it would be over soon. A sure sign it has some serious problems. I just don't understand what the fuss was about! Sure it had a couple of good moments, but overall it was barely mediocre."
"edawstwin","2","1","1","30 August 2000"," Mediocre at best
","It is a sad day when a film like American Beauty wins an Oscar for Best Picture (although the Academy hardly ever chooses the absolute best film of the year anymore), and is currently 3rd on a list (IMDB Top 250) with Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Dr. Strangelove and so many other truly great films behind it.  As far as the Academy goes, they can be forgiven because 1999 was such a poor year for good films.  The Matrix, Election, Fight Club, The Sixth Sense, and maybe one or two others deserved attention.  Since it had the hype, and an amazing actor in Kevin Spacey, winning over the above-mentioned films was easy.  As far as the IMDB voters go, they (we) can be forgiven for pretty much the same reason.  Films today suck.  There are exceptions, as with everything, but when a mediocre film like American Beauty gets raves like it has, you know something is wrong.  The script was the worst part of this movie.  Colonel Fitts and all three females were caricatures and made me cringe anytime any of them did ANYTHING!  Kevin Spacey was great as usual - I would love to see this character in a good film.  Wes Bentley proved himself a very good actor, but didn't have much to work with.  And talk about predictable!  What's up with telling us Lester's going to die in a year?  As soon as I saw the guns in Fitt's house, I knew he would kill him.  As soon as we understood Fitts was a homophobe, I knew why he would kill him.  (That scene where he watches through the obscured window belonged on a bad sitcom)  As soon as Angela ran her mouth about sleeping with the photographer to get a job, I knew she was a virgin.  There were so many scenes that were laughable (not funny, but so bad I had to laugh).  Extreme amateur writing.  Not that I could do any better, but hey, I'm an amateur too.  Admittedly I usually figure out the mysteries 10 minutes in, and so most films bore me.  But this one insulted me.  It looked worth a rental from the trailer (mainly because of Spacey), but I finally gave in and paid to see it at a theater just before the Oscars so I could compare all of the nominees.  Mistake.<br/><br/>Another reviewer said that anyone who rated this poorly missed out.  Well, if missing out means liking amateurish scripts, then I'll gladly ""miss out"" the rest of my life.  I urge all of you to watch this again and compare it to an Oscar winner from the 40s through the 70s (The Apartment, Annie Hall, On the Waterfront all immediately come to mind).  Doesn't belong anywhere in the neighborhood of any of these."

But this movie seemed to me a movie that should have been an airplane-like absurd comedy except for its dose of exaggerated reality formed from the worst america has to offer.  As a result, somehow this movie becomes 'fine cinema', and according to the academy, the best artistic creation of the year.  Please.<br/><br/>Yeah, there was symbolic imagery.  But geez it was all over the place, obvious and shallow.  Oh boy, there's a vase with roses.  Hey, her dress has a rose print to it.  Didn't she prune rose bushes?  Oh my gosh, the front door is red.  They might've well subtitled these scenes in flashing letters saying 'imagery relating to roses ahoy, which could mean passion and love'.<br/><br/>To me, a great movie brings out the best in us and/or makes us think.

But neither is enough reason to watch a movie in my book.<br/><br/>The script is full of clichés (dark side of sterile suburbia, empty lives, misunderstood teenagers, etc.). The characters are one-dimensional. There were parts of a good movie in it, but they're buried in everything else. It was also a surprisingly tasteless movie. The show-offy interludes that Spacey's character experiences are initially interesting but then become tiresome. The whole thing suffers from a major case of self-importance.<br/><br/>I'm truly mystified by those who feel this is An Important Movie that comments on U.S. society. I'm even more mystified by anyone who finds it humorous.

","I think that it's appropriate that ""American Beauty"" came out in 1999. In that year, I was as old as my parents were in 1967, when ""The Graduate"" and ""Bonnie and Clyde"" both came out. Those were both movies that presented things differently than most movies previously had. Entertainment Weekly called 1999 something like ""the year that changed movies"", citing ""Election"", ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""American Beauty"" and ""Being John Malkovich"" as examples.<br/><br/>Anyway, ""American Beauty"" is an indictment of the suburban lifestyle. Middle class Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) has a steady job and a typical family. His self-indulgent wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) seems absolutely bent on training their teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch) to be ""perfect"". But then, when Lester catches sight of Jane's friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) at a dance, the whole Burnham household begins to go through some massive changes. Changes which will irrevocably alter everything.<br/><br/>This may be the perfect movie. I can't even begin to describe how good it is. With top-notch performances from its main players (plus outstanding performances from Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Allison Janney, Scott Bakula, Sam Robards and Peter Gallagher), an excellent script by Alan Ball, and A-one direction by Sam Mendes, you can see why it won Best Picture.<br/><br/>Just an extra note.

"mark.waltz","4","5","12","14 January 2015"," A glorification of the destruction of the American family.
","Hollywood used to give Oscars to films of consequence, to films which ambitiously told stories of real people rising above strife and issues which touched the core of the world. But that was during the golden age of movie making when Andy Hardy's mother would smile simply because he asked for another piece of pie and Fred Astaire would gallantly guide Ginger Rogers around the dance floor. When movies about serious issues such as alcoholism, mental illness and anti-Semitism came in, one movie mogul apparently described it with the statement about realism, ""So is diarrhea, but I don't want to see it on screen."" <br/><br/>Yes, we can see through our daily lives that ""focus on the family"" is an overstated attempt by certain groups to diminish the realism that families do fail, and not with the help of the groups they don't see eye to eye with. In theatrical drama, this evidence goes back to some of the classics of the American theater, particularly plays by Tennessee Williams and Edward Albee, and those plays hold up strongly today because the elements of why those families were failing were better detailed. Even the black comedy ""The War of the Roses"" showed us the motivations behind the hatred, but all ""American Beauty"" does is show us that men are sex starved pigs, that women are bitches, that teenagers are messed up because of their sex starved fathers and bitchy mothers and that there's no hope for the future generation.<br/><br/>Certainly, this film is excellent as far as the acting is concerned, yet the characters are all extremely creepy and unlikable. Nobody plays creepy weirdos better than Kevin Spacey, and in spite of being that creepy weirdo, his character is actually somewhat understandable, albeit in a pathetic, you can't help but feel sorry for him sort of way. His lust for his nasty daughter's best friend is at first ""ikky"" to watch as is his obsession with getting out of the job that he hates with a high paid exit benefit package. Annette Bening is certainly great at playing neurotic bitches, and here she does so quite brilliantly with passive/aggressive gusto. She's quite sweet and somewhat phony with the gay couple next door, yet she turns on her husband with the venom of a cobra towards a mongoose. The sex scene she has with rival real estate agent Peter Gallagher is filmed with a lustful anger, as if what Gallagher is doing to her she is psychologically doing to her husband.<br/><br/>Thora Birch expresses typical teenaged bitterness and insecurities with the violent thud of an anvil being dropped from a skyscraper. She not only hates her parents, but is totally embarrassed by having them around, especially after a basketball game for which she is a cheerleader. Birch's character certainly doesn't have the personality of a cheerleader; In fact, on the court, she can't even force herself to crack a smile and just goes through the routine as if she was being forced at gunpoint to do what most teenaged girls would give their I-Phone (well, maybe not...) to do.<br/><br/>Mena Suvari, as her cheerleader pal, is probably the most complex character here, the typically self-centered supposedly perfect girl who actually is more insecure than she lets on. In one disturbing fight scene between Birch and Suvari, her vulnerability really explodes when Birch refers to her as ordinary. How many times has somebody longed to tell off the cheerleader type to try and break their spirit, and when it happens here, it really turns out to be sad. Wes Bentley is the new kid next door, the son of an ex-Marine (a truly scary Chris Cooper), forced by his dad to take a drug test every six months. But unbeknownst to the homophobic Cooper, Bentley has a secret life of his own, a hidden supply of drugs and an obsession with filming everyone around him without their knowledge.<br/><br/>Cooper's angry Marine is instantly incensed to find out that the neighbors two doors down is a male gay couple, but this homophobia hides something truly disturbing. Not only is there his obsession with Nazi memorabilia but his own underlying sexuality and abuse of his fragile wife (played with quiet strength by the always excellent Allison Janney). The lives of these characters intertwine to the point of an exploding volcano, a sinking ship without lifeboats, and really, the best escape from this mess turns out to be Spacey's fate. At two hours, this is a depressing and exhausting view of the messed up lives of humans too stupid to realize that they are responsible in most part for their inner destruction. After this was over, I felt as if I had been shot with a taser gun all over my body and needed extensive therapy just to recover from watching these people whom I hope never to know become more and more pathetic."

","Technically, this movie doesn't exactly break new ground--it portrays the dark side of suburbia--that's been done in the '60s (No Down Payment), 70s (Stepford Wives) and 80s (Blue Velvet). This movie does the same thing but got a lot of praise--WAY too much.<br/><br/>Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey are good. Bening basically plays a cold, materialistic ""witch"" who cares about money and furnishings more than anything else. She's never played a character like this and she's just great. Spacey plays a man who we see, in the course of the film, imploding. He feels trapped and disgusted with his job and life and goes to extremes to escape his situation.<br/><br/>SPOILERS!!! So he rebels against conforming and drives his wife (who wants to conform)and daughter crazy. Then there's a turn around with his character at the end that I didn't believe for one second. He realizes that he does love his wife and daughter and decides to make them happy. Then he's killed. So--the message here is to conform or you'll be killed. That message is pretty scary and negative. And he's killed by a closeted gay guy whose advances he rejected. That's more than a little homophobic. SPOILER END!<br/><br/>The acting is good and the film LOOKS great--there are some beautiful shots here--but it's message is horrible, negative and more than a little scary. It's now considered one of the worst pictures ever to win a Best Picture Oscar. I agree!"

"sychonic","Null","5","12","25 May 2001"," Beautifully grotesque
","Though it's fashionable to find this movie artistic and meaningful, it's mostly a collage of other films.  The essence of the movie seems derivative of the very first scene in ""Blue Velvet"" where the camera starts up high over a sleepy suburb, then descends slowly until it moves into the grass and finds a festering hole full of bugs.  The message being, of course, that beneath the clean sterile exterior is a messy, dark, and unpleasant actual existence.  <br/><br/>The film techniques were extremely reminiscent of ""Risky Business"" with the lingering closeups--and the rose petals evoked the camera shot in that movie (far better) of the hose slowly penetrating a large shrub. <br/><br/>
The movie itself takes it's central plot from ""Lolita"", self consciously so. The real problem is not with the movie per se, rather it is done a disservice by the wacky response to it.  This isn't the best movie of the decade, it didn't deserve best picture, and it isn't a stark revelation about the secret heart of the American family.  <br/><br/>What it is is a reasonably funny movie about a rather pathetic middle American middle aged father who has let his personal crisis get away from him.  In fact, the real underlying message of the movie, one I've not seen before, is that the American family is being deeply hurt by a modern culture that has rejected personal responsibility.  Spacey methodically rejects everything that is supposed to make life worth living: work, family, religion; and embraces teen sex, drugs and the cult of the body.  What does it ultimately get him?  <br/><br/>This movie is kind of a throwback to the seventies with movies like ""The Last Married Couple in America"", ""Serial"", and ""Middle Age Crazy"".  It's worth a look, but for those who start spouting about the MEANING and the ARTISTRY, I'd advise them to get a life."

It is pretentious to the point that one becomes embarrassed for the actors and writers for having created such superficial drivel.  It reminds me of what someone would say in a junior high school poetry class.  The ideological implications of the film blatant and offensive, portraying the neighbor as a reactionary conservative fanatic that is just attempting to cover up his homosexuality, and his wife as a braindead house wife, implying that for woman to do anything other than pursue a career she must be brainwashed.  The only positive characters in the movie are the gay next door neighbors.  Living a ""normal"" lifestyle and being a part of a traditional family are anathema in the movie as Kevin Spacey points out ""there is nothing worse than being normal.""

Thora Birch is pedestrian as the daughter lacking self confidence. Talk about a show stopper; Mena Suvari plays the flirtatious tart with zest. She can make any man go to the garage and start pumping iron.<br/><br/>A man making haphazard choices in trying to recover his life is not so much out of the norm.

","I've seen this one a few times before, and I never liked it as much as I did the first time; that probably had something to do with certain positive circumstances I can't go into here. In any case, 'American Beauty' has a couple of fine scenes that always greatly amuse me. You know, Angela's dance, the dance of the plastic bag and Jane and Ricky's intimate moments for instance.<br/><br/>At many other moments, though, I wish Sam Mendez had toned it down considerably. Now it feels much like an over-stylized pastiche of concentrated misery with too many angles (i.e. characters). A lot of dialogue (and monologue) feels too contrived, as does the whole story - though some of it works really well, I must add. So I can't say that it's a bad film, but for a black comedy it isn't always sharp and funny enough and for a drama it doesn't go deep enough, mainly because it has too many things going on.<br/><br/>And then there is Kevin Spacey. I love him in films such as 'Se7en' or 'The Usual Suspects' where he plays no less than iconic bad guys, but here there are only bits and pieces that really convince me. Most other actors are quite convincing, like Gary Cooper, but his role of homophobic, militaristic (helpless) husband and father is one of those 'things' that feel so overly contrived - though, again, there is a lot of potential.<br/><br/>6 out of 10."

There is a scene where Chris Cooper kisses Kevin Spacey, this scene was so not necessary, there was just no point in it.<br/><br/>Three other film were nominated for Best Picture the same year, and they all are way better then this film, take for example The Sixth Sense which should have won the Oscar instead of this film.<br/><br/>There are also two great performances that were nominated for Best Actor, Denzel Washington for The Hurricane and Russel Crowe for the insider, they were both greater than Kevin Spacey's performance, and still they were ignored by the Academy Award.<br/><br/>In the end , my rating for this film will be 4 out of 10.

","Sam Mendes' tale of self-fulfilment is a masterpiece. Everything works together in a wonderful harmony which is utterly memorable, gripping and beautiful to look at.<br/><br/>It rings true, for the most part, because of two people, namely Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening. Spacey is so sardonic, so world-weary and so precise with every word in every line that he makes every second spent with his character joyous, whilst Bening brings a pitch-perfect portrayal of insecurity and suburban façade that frankly puts ""Desperate Housewives"" to shame. The entire ensemble gels together magnificently.<br/><br/>But the film is not just made by the supreme acting but also by the fantastic dark comedy. The script, by Alan Ball, is hilarious in such a brilliantly inventive way, the likes of which have not been seen since Billy Wilder.<br/><br/>And then there's the visual style. Mendes' images are stunning, memorable and clever (plenty of thanks should also go to DP, Conrad L. Hall). The direction is detectable but not overly forceful. You're aware of the director's hand but it doesn't bother you and this makes you think. It absorbs you into the film completely.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful experience and not to be missed.

","You can probably count on your fingers the number of successful above-average films that have been made about surburban life. (""Lolita"" is one. ""No Down Payment"" is not.) Excluding the ones in which the house is taken over by a gang of rapist thugees or whatnot. There used to be a genre called suburban literature (John Cheever, etc.) but whatever visual potential the milieu of No Problem Drive may have had was drained by TV serials.<br/><br/>Here, on the other hand, is a movie about exactly that kind of dull life, centered about mortgages and SUVs, that succeeds in almost all respects, from comic (the first half) to dramatic (the last half).<br/><br/>I found it touching when it was released and figured, well, one viewing was enough, but seeing it again has only deepened my respect for the film and the people behind it.<br/><br/>Truth, goodness, and beauty -- such rarely found commodities among the wisteria and the rose bushes and the asphalt driveways and the dinner china from Hitler's table. The dinner china from HITLER'S TABLE? Yes, it's true. The Marine colonel (Chris Cooper) who moves in next door to the Burnhams (Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening) has such a platter locked up with the guns in his display cabinet. You can't tell what it is just by looking at it. You have to turn it over. On the bottom there is no sign of the manufacturer, just a small, simple Swastika.<br/><br/>The whole story is kind of about that. When you turn the pretty glistening object over -- well, you'd better not.<br/><br/>The performances are uniformly good. Kevin Spacey is outstanding. And Chris Cooper as the counterfeit colonel is especially good in a strictly dramatic role, with his military haircut and his traitorous rheumy eyes. I don't know why they had to make him a Marine though. Never in history has there been a gay marine. Well, except maybe for Ed Wood, who landed under fire on Pacific beaches during the big war while wearing a pair of panties under his uniform. But technically even he was a transvestite. Why couldn't they have put him in the Navy? All those months at sea? And no women? Cooper may turn out to be an abusive father, a homosexual, and a murderer, but you feel sorry for the guy anyway when he has to come to terms with himself. In fact there isn't a soul in this movie for whom you don't feel at least some pity. That's a feat in itself. A movie with no one-dimensional heavies. Only one gunshot fired in anger -- and off screen. And only two sex scenes -- one comic and the other unfulfilled.<br/><br/>The story is well written and well photographed. (Lots of memorable tag lines.) One of those empty plastic little bags that junk food is carried in, dancing around in a breeze, with its chorus of tannin-colored fall leaves.<br/><br/>Not that it doesn't have its weaknesses. What movie is perfect? The transition from comedy to drama is deftly handled but some of the character development seems rather abrupt and over-edited. Mena Suvari, as the empty-headed narcissistic 17-year-old is told she is ""ordinary"" by a boy her age. She calls him a psycho freak and storms out of the room, ""weirded out."" She's correct in calling him freaky. I don't believe he blinks once in the entire movie. But, okay, so someone she despises has told her she's ugly and ordinary. She's angry and dismissive. And yet the next time we see her (in a romantic moonlit living room with Spacey) her eyes are watering and she has undergone an epiphany. ""I can't stand being ordinary,"" she tells Spacey before yielding her virginity to him, or trying to. Spacey has his own epiphany when he finds out she's unsullied. He has visions of roses, of majestic vistas, of San Quentin.<br/><br/>And I guess I can't see why the movie sets us up for having Bening murder Spacey and then turning the task over to someone else. And maybe the overhead shot after the killing looks a little like ""Taxi Driver."" And I suppose having the narration by a dead man reminds one of ""Sunset Boulevard."" And the final voice-over by Spacey, about how the last second of life lasts forever and consists of memories of boyhood and husbandhood and fatherhood are a little corny. Granted some of the characters are hackneyed and all are overdrawn, but consider how unpromising the material was to begin with, as if Mozart had written a particularly difficult sonata to be played on partly filled wine glasses. <br/><br/>But that's minor stuff. This is a good movie. Lots of pop songs from the early 70s if you're into that."

It's unbelievable what he managed to capture in the time span of less than two hours. Probably the most amazing screenplay ever written. It captures perfect our modern society and the world we are living in. That's also the reason why it won't become a timeless classic: it's about our current way of living, here and now, at this very moment of speaking.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey gives one of the best performances ever in the history of film. He is probably the most deserved winner of the Academy Award of Best Actor in a Leading Role ever. I thought he was outstanding and perfectly casted as Lester Burnham.<br/><br/>Mena Suvari and Thora Birch gave both excellent performance as well. Another great actor who was highly overlooked was Chris Cooper. He gave an outstanding performance and deserved at least an Academy Award Nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. But unfortunately, we all know he still had to wait a couple of years before he finally got some recognition, and this for another brilliant performance by him, this time in ""Adaptation."".<br/><br/>What more can I say about ""American Beauty""? It probably has already been said many other times in many other comments. Nice piece of art! Maybe some advice for the people who haven't watched it, but are really looking forward to see it. There is some level of 'open mind' and 'modern thinking' necessary to appreciate this movie, I think. People who are some what conservative and who believe that the so called ""American Beauty"" is definitely real (I believe the title of the movie is meant ironically) and not at all fiction like Mendes suggest, probably won't like this movie.

American Beauty is a great film, some people might think that it's going over the edge with what goes on in the movie, but I think it's just showing every possible thing that could be going on in a family.

","A film that steals ideas from David Lynch's Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks can't be a bad thing, right? Well, under Sam Mendes's stiff, theatrical direction it's plain wrong. Alan Ball has written a poor man's Blue Velvet and it's an insult to see such praise heaped upon this unoriginal work. The film already feels dated and pompous - even Desperate Housewives is better than this pseudo-intellectual tosh. And that leads me to my next critique. American Beauty is really a TV drama series masquerading as a film. There is no sense of cinema in Mendes's by numbers direction, save the quasi- Lynchian dream-like 'after death' prologue and epilogue which now feels strained and unimaginative.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey as Lester Bunham is as languid as they come and it baffles me the praise he received in his undernourished performance. In contrast, Annette Bening as his wife gives an overstated performance that lacks subtlety and depth. Mind you, the script doesn't allow much depth for the characters because they are too busy adhering to prescribed stereotypes.<br/><br/>Worse still, the film has a dubious moral agenda. Painting Burham as a sympathetic anti-hero is not what the film does well- his attempt to seduce an underage girl is glossed over as if it doesn't matter. Ball lacks the moral courage to question the ethical judgments Burnham makes. A for the symbolism, it belongs in a cartoon book such is its simplicity.<br/><br/>This is quite an insulting film. It's as bad as any other Oscar winner. Multiplex fare for those who want to think sometimes - Lynch for the masses."

So to actually be able to sit in a theatre and watch a genuinely inspired and original piece of film as this is a very special occasion these days. Way too many current movies are aimed at 16 year olds and have more care and attention lavished on the media promotion and merchandising rights than the movie itself, so it's a real treat to see a movie aimed at adults, with characters you can empathize with, a witty and complex script, first rate acting,  fresh direction and splendid cinematography. Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his career as suburban rebel Lester Burnham. He is the obvious focal point of the movie, but I was also impressed by relative newcomers Thora Birch, Wes Bentley and Mena Suvari, and also the seriously underrated Chris Cooper ('Lone Star'). The only minor quibble I have with the movie is Annette Bening's character, which to me doesn't have the depth of the others, and often just comes across as a stereotypical shrewish wife. Apart from that, it's difficult to fault 'American Beauty'. A recent second viewing on DVD was just as enjoyable and impressive as my first viewing on its original cinema release.

I loved Benning in The American President and Spacey in just about everything he has done. However, the script in this film was such that these two actors can't do anything but ply their trade with professionalism in the midst of an abundantly grotesque story."

What it DID tell me was that the majority of people using this site have INCREDIBLY different taste than me. In fact, maybe seeing this movie helped me more than I know. I will be extremely less influenced by the rating system on this site. Because, for me personally, this is the absolute, hands-down worst film I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. I was actually ashamed of myself after viewing it for watching ALL excruciating 2 hours of it. I wish I had those 2 hours back. The characters are predictable, over-the-top, underwhelming. The acting was easy because all the characters are cliché. And besides the hateful feeling I have toward this film, in a way it left me with absolutely nothing to think of afterwords. There IS no message here. The plot holes are so gaping that I won't even start to explain them. I think the greatest insult to this film is to call it mediocre. I think the producers were maybe looking for that ""love it or hate it"" feeling in viewers. But to give this piece of trash an emotional response would be doing them a favour. So I hate it, but only because it wasted my time. And I would rate it a 5 just to show my lack of an emotional response, but at the same time I can't bring myself to lie to IMDb users and tell them it's even worth seeing.<br/><br/>This film is best left forgotten.

The bit about the slut being a virgin towards the end is also far from believable. The so-called artistic directing is also a farce.

","My expectations were really high since all I ever heard about this movie were good things but now I don't really seem to understand the reason for that. Technically and visually yes Sam Mendes did a great job and this movie is beautiful to watch but like it happened in one of his other movie (1917) the visuals didn't matched the plot.<br/><br/>The plot is really boring if you ask me and I think that people who are saying that this has a great message are just looking to close, even when a movie is about nothing there are always some ""smart"" ones who claim that it had a deeper meaning like in this case. Everything about this movie is a complete cliche. The facade wedding, the cheating wife, the father that can't connect to his teenage daughter who has also the cliche temperament of a teenager, the weird kid next door who is going to fall in love with the weird teenager who has a father that is the most cliche character in this: a homophobic and rigid Colonel who wants discipline and structure in everything and beats his son. What is the deeper meaning here? This portrays a bunch of cliches and things that are not new to anyone.<br/><br/>The acting was average overall. I don't really know how can anyone say that this was Spacey's best performance, was a good one but to me it looks like he was just kinda being himself in a lot of parts.<br/><br/>A big hole in the plot to me is that we know how they are now but we don't know how they came to this, how did the father lost connection to his daughter if he says that they used to be friends? What did happen to they're marriage? Are you just assuming that every marriage gets like this for no reason or that every adolescent disconnects to they're parents? Because that's not true. The only character that who get a background story is the drug dealer kid. Not to mention that the daughter which's father wasn't violente and rigid and his only problem was to have a crush on her friend even said that wanted here father to die, kidding or not you don't say something like that just for saying, but the boy which's father beat him and controlled his life and even shipped him to a military college and interned him said that his father was a good men and didn't wished him wrong, how does this make any sense?<br/><br/>This is a weak, cliched, non-sensed story disguised with beautiful visuals and a good storytelling and that is the truth about this movie, everyone who thinks this is a masterpiece is seeing things where they don't exist!"

","Pier Paolo Pasolini once said, ""Whatever the bourgeois do, they are wrong"", and the 20th century is littered with literature, cinema and art dedicated to bourgeois-bashing. Nothing, it seems, appeals more to the pseudo intellect and culture vulture than a good jab at the middle class.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>As Mailer slyly observed, ""the 'artist' labours under the illusion that he is fundamentally classless"". Such an individual is therefore free to attack the mores of the stilted conservative middle-brow. He is of course bohemian and liberal and free from the constraining modes of bourgeois thought. Invariably though, he is as middle-brow as the types he attacks, and sheepish at his lack of noble peasant heritage. Therefore such polemics are merely self-flagellation.<br/><br/>'American Beauty' is an incredibly contrived piece of work. Contrived to illicit huge guilt assuaging, middle-brow applause and all the attendant awards that brings. <br/><br/>Its viewpoint is that of the artistic liberal. The middle-aged, middle-class heterosexual union is stagnant and repressive. A veritable breeding ground for infidelity and discontent. The corporate workplace which financially sustains it is soul-crushing and corrupt. The harshly disciplinarian, ex-military father is a implosive, repressed homosexual who collects guns and Nazi tableware. The 'out' male homosexual couple are paragons of attractive, fully functioning gracious humanity. And guilt-free capitalists to boot. <br/><br/>All of the teenagers are deeply unlikeable and speak in inverted commas as if distancing themselves from their own existences. But they are basically good kids corrupted and misled by their parents false values. <br/><br/>These characters are drawn in crude broad strokes, reducing them to soap-opera /pantomime types and thus allowing the (almost entirely middle-class) audience a sense of detached superiority.<br/><br/>Inevitably the film trips over its own muddled morality. It's middle-aged 'hero' is merely regressing to juvenilia, his 'freedom' a contextually different reiteration of the obsession with eternal youth and beauty. The male teenage protagonist obtains his funds through drug-dealing. But the proceeds pay for his technologically assisted insight, so thats okay.<br/><br/>And, hey. It's only grass he's selling, after all.<br/><br/>Despite all of this the film is not unenjoyable. It is beautiful to look at (visually it owes a deal to Lynch and Kubrick), and the fabled Kevin Spacey charm makes it's central character more sympathetic than he otherwise should be. Thomas Newman's ubiquitous new-agey score ties it all together, cleverly adding to the films entirely spurious sense of significance. The tedious symbolism likewise flatters it's audiences (no doubt) refined sense of aesthetics.<br/><br/>One of the most overrated films of recent times."

","Please don't get this movie confused with another 1999 movie, ""American Pie"", which was a funny but rather crude movie about horny teenagers all trying to get laid.<br/><br/>""American Beauty"" is about real life, about dysfunctional families who don't realize why they are crazy. Until Lester (Kevin Spacey) figures it out. Quits his job, quits pretending he is something he is not, and learns to really begin to deal with life. There are lots of laughs, but also lots of drama.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, this is a movie about Lester's life and death. ""American Beauty"" has the courage to look at ""us"". It does so through the eyes of Lester Burnham who tells you at the beginning that he will be dead within the year. Interesting concept!!There are several other stories in the movie, but they are there only as they relate to Lester's. In some spots, it would be easy to walk out of the movie because of where you think it may be going. But stay, watch the whole thing, see how it all fits together and I think you'll agree it is a rare movie among all the special-effect, mega blockbuster that seems to be turned out like beanie babies. Although this one is totally different, the way its messages come through may remind you of movies like ""Fargo"" and ""A Simple Plan"". If you didn't think those were fine movies, skip this one.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey gives an award-quality performance. Most middle-aged men will quickly identify with his character. But turn the roles around and women should just as easily identify.<br/><br/>The reason I say this movie is not for youngsters is because they have not lived enough to comprehend and identify with the characters. But the sex and language are not nearly as bad as some mainstream movies. There is nudity, and graphic discussion of sex acts and body parts among teenagers in this movie, but it probably was necessary within the overall context. I give it 9 of 10, a must-see for any adult who enjoys examining his or her situation in life.<br/><br/>2009 edit: I have watched this movie several more times and have enjoyed it as much as I did on the first viewing.<br/><br/>2014 edit: I upgraded to Blu-Ray for this movie, it is worth it."

Then we realize how cliche and and completely amateur the writing is.  Then, for the grand finale, it's the most pointless and least satisfying ending ever filmed.<br/><br/>American Beauty stands out as a shining example of everything that's wrong with modern filmmaking.  There is not an ounce of creativity or inspiration demonstrated on the part of anyone involved, and that includes good ol' Kevin Spacey.

The themes and characters are still timeless,and still resonates with us. Also, the bullshit about pedophilia gets me wondering why any human being would believe such trolls. I guess you could interpret that however.<br/><br/>The movie is about Lester Burnham who is going through a mid-life crisis. He has a controlling wife who always nags at Lester, a rebellious angst driven teenage daughter, a horrible corrupt job, and he falls in love with his daughters friend. As you could probably tell, his life just goes downhill from here.<br/><br/>This is one compelling and engaging movie. From the opening scene you are instantly thrown into Lester's life, right down to the explosive finale at the end. I don't think people get how much depth there is in this movie, or maybe they forgot. The movie was highly acclaimed by critics and was nominated for a lot of awards, yet for some reason people started hating on it years after. The movie has a multitude of themes however, from lust, marriage, purpose, motivation, insecurities, being ordinary, and homosexuality. Those are heavy topics, but the film actually has some dark acid wit to it. It's not a particularly depressing film, the characters are very interesting as they go through their own problems.<br/><br/>The movie is a masterpiece, it has such a beautiful yet haunting score and the dream sequences were Lester fantasizes about his daughters friend gives symbolism and meaning behind his character. The plastic bag scene I have mixed feelings about, I could understand why they wanted to show it, gives meaning to one of the characters traits, but I thought the delivery was cheesy. The pace is suitably slow, I love the atmosphere of the film and how the film takes its time to flesh out the characters and themes. Sam Mendes does an excellent job at directing making each and every scene stand out.<br/><br/>The flaws I have are some questionable scenes. Like when Lester is eavesdropping on his daughter and her friend and they hear something outside, Lester thinks they hear him and loudly runs down stairs. First of all, how did they not hear Lester? They hear one tap on the window but not the loud running just outside their door? Also, like the bag scene there are a lot of heavy handed moments in the movie in terms of acting and throwing symbolism's and metaphor's.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie left an impact on me. Lester's mundane routine gets me worried if that stuff will happen to me in the future. Well, it probably will, since I already feel as though I have mid-life existential crisis's. Oh gosh.

He also has repressed homosexual desires. Are there really people like Colonel Fits? Not really. No one is that one dimensional. Are there conservatives with repressed homosexual urges? I am sure there are plenty. But this film intentionally makes Colonel Fits unbelievably one dimensional, unable to speak to his son except in the most rigid fashion, unable to express love or compassion (in the leftist view, conservatives lack this ability), completely out of touch with his own feelings, and emotionally retarded beyond belief. This incredible picture of the man is meant to help convey some leftist viewpoints; conservatives are uptight, screwed up people. They are incapable of feeling or expressing love or compassion, incapable of perceiving reality because of their emotional immaturity, etc. It is also meant to advance the idea that handguns, especially in the hands of uptight conservatives, are dangerous and likely to be used for murder. <br/><br/>These ideas are not overtly advanced. They are suggested by the story and the portrayal of the people who own the guns. <br/><br/>The movie has good actors, and was produced well. The story is interesting and the different plot lines converge together well. That helps the viewer buy into the movie. It also helps sell the unspoken leftist lessons. They are subtly imparted but not unnoticed. <br/><br/>Hollywood wants us to come away from the film saying: -why don't those uptight conservatives just accept gay people and be gay if they want to be, -people shouldn't have guns around because they will just kill people in an emotional moment of weakness, especially those uptight conservatives.<br/><br/>Most of us know military veterans or active servicemen and women and resent seeing how Hollywood portrays them.

However, after you've seen it a few times, the rose begins to wilt, unmasking contradictory characters and inexplicable events that unfold just to appease its themes of confinement, conformity, redemption and sexuality—why does Lester lecture Carolyn about materialism right after HE's the one that bought a Pontiac Firebird? Why didn't writer Ball or director Mendes at least try to make Bening's character slightly redeemable? All the many other questions to raise require spoilers, but the list goes on... Hard to completely hate because it's easy to understand why so many people like it.<br/><br/>★★½ (out of four)"

","It's a sign of how good an actor Kevin Spacey is that he makes Lester Burch so appealing, because Burch is a contemptible man who deserves all the unhappiness he has. When we meet him, he shows no interest in anything or anyone outside himself. That's his misfortune, because he has no inner resources. He has no ideas and no thoughts, only feelings of loss and unfocused resentment. There is not a book in his house. He has no apparent religion and no apparent politics. He doesn't even have a hobby to give some artificial structure and meaning to his life.<br/><br/>His present condition is the natural consequence of the youth he remembers with nostalgic longing. Lester Burch is 42 in the fall of 1998, when American Beauty begins. He is the exact contemporary of Kevin Arnold and the kids in the basement on That 70s Show. He would have graduated from high school the year Nixon resigned and from college at the bottom of the Sour Seventies. He remembers a few political catch phrases about fascism from his childhood, but he mourns the passing of no youthful ideals and no youthful ambitions. Burch describes himself as a frat boy who drank and screwed his way through college. The youthful joy whose loss he now laments is no more than the joy of a constant frat party -- life as a beer commercial. Once marriage and fatherhood ended the party, Burch drifted into his dead end job and sterile family life because he had never prepared himself for anything better. <br/><br/>When his balls galvanize his brain into life, Burch can conceive no better rebellion than regressing to the frat boy he remembers having been. He abandons any obligation to support his wife and daughter. He gets a minimum wage, minimum effort job. He listens to the bad rock and roll of his youth. He buys the car he always wanted as a teenager. He spends the rest of his money on weed and toys. He spends the rest of his time on restoring his body to what it should have been at age 19, so that a 16 year old hottie will want to have sex with him. He takes as his model the teen-aged marijuana dealer next door, who can be fearless because he has no responsibilities to anyone but himself. He deserts his family as completely as he can without moving out of the house where he lives, rent free, on what his wife earns selling other houses.<br/><br/>Lester Burch, in short, is a man who never grew up and who feels that the world owes him a party. He is useless to himself and others, and there is no particular reason for him to continue to take up air that somebody better could breathe. He only has one moment of redemption -- when he finally sees the 16 year old object of his fantasies as a confused, frightened, vulnerable human being instead of a sex toy, he has enough residual decency to treat her decently. That isn't enough. Burch cannot go back to 19. His daughter is about to run away and his wife to throw him out. He has boxed himself into a dead end, from which his fortuitous, though foreshadowed, murder is a convenient exit. While his death may be messy, it will be no loss to anyone once his brains are wiped off the kitchen tile."

","I watched this movie a around 5 years ago for the first time, and after I finished watching it, after struggling for around 2 hours, I reached the verdict that it had a boring plot, and the idea of a married man with a teenage daughter wanting to get it on with a girl his daughter's age was disgusting. <br/><br/>After recently re-watching American Beauty, I can't believe how wrong I was back then. I guess it's more of an age thing, this is one of those films that would grow on you with every viewing, the more you watch it the more you will appreciate it, this is not a simple movie, it requires a lot of thinking and touches on a lot of subjects. Subjects like homosexuality, midlife crisis, homophobic, smoking pot, disciple, work out, physical attraction, real state businessman & more. All these subjects are also shown in a more positive light. But most of all this film shows us how beautiful the world really is.<br/><br/>The plot follows different characters who are involved in all these social subjects. The movie is also very well acted as if the actors portraying the characters are the characters themselves. Kevin Spacey is absolutely brilliant as Lester, he perfectly portrays a man who is going though a midlife crisis, a boring life like he is a prisoner & getting bossed around by his wife & he could be described as sexually frustrated. After he sees Angela, Jane's friend his desires awaken, he becomes a changed man and does not take orders from his wife anymore and tries to become physically attractive. By the end of the film when he finds out Angela is a Virgin, he sees her as his own daughter. What a perfect transformation & change of character. <br/><br/>Mena Suvari portrays a teenage girl who wants to be extraordinary and the center of attention very well, and she is also beautiful on Screen. Thora Birch as Jane was fine in portraying the teenage girl who wanted freedom and also was being sort of a weird or mysterious character. At first you may find Ricky creepy but later you will feel sympathy for him and realize why he or his mother is this way and why Ricky records! Because he simply wants to capture the beauty of the world. He also wants the freedom to do what he wants without his father's interference which connects him to Jane. Chris Cooper naturally portrays the retired colonel who tries to flex his authority over his family through aggressive behavior towards them, perhaps a homophobic or a man afraid of his own sexuality. <br/><br/>Annette Benning as Carolyn is also fantastic she is quite possibly the best portrayal of a real state business woman in a movie, she cannot accept defeat, occupies superior position in her house, bosses her husband around and values materials more than enjoying life. Then her life takes a turn after Lester stops taking orders from her and she becomes very frustrated and she was also decisively losing to a competitor named Buddy, after this she started an illegitimate relationship with buddy, & she started enjoying life again till her husband discovered her affair and she broke up with Buddy and felt broken again. It was not until her Husband's death she realized that she actually loved him. Again great transformation and character development. The minor characters also put on a commendable performance.<br/><br/>All characters in this film are fantastic and well acted and the plot flows though really well because of it. The soundtrack is also fantastic and suits the feel of the movie. Some really memorable and funny scenes too, which you will feel like watching over and over again and enjoy. This film does try to tell its story but it doesn't remain serious it also tries to be funny. Thus it is a perfect blend of comedy, drama and social commentary. <br/><br/>My only gripe with this movie would be its pacing because even the film just slightly over 2 hours long, the film feels like its longer , it moves at a very slow & methodical pace to deliver its message. The viewer would also be left deeply interpreting what he saw. This affects the film's replay value. Additionally the actors who played Jane and Ricky remained expression throughout most of the film, maybe it is a part of their characters but it really makes their performance not stand out compared to the rest of the cast, plus their scenes dragged on, apart from the scene with the flying Bag & the scene in which where Ricky tells her his real story. Lester's fantasies about Angela were also overdone in my opinion. <br/><br/>But those are just minor issues of an otherwise absolutely brilliant film which is as close as a film can get to a work of art, this film absolutely worthy of the Oscar it received. The people who dislike this film or think it is overrated should actually try to re-watch it and see what they think of it now, because this is one of those films that you will appreciate and understand more, the more you watch it"

","American Beauty is about hope, love, freedom, depression, and family. Lester Burham is presented as a depressed, common man who is unhappy with his job and his life at home. He comes across as a bit of a 'loser' as his wife and daughter think this and walk all over him. The wife Carolyn is a ambitious business woman who seeks success and only cares about that as she thinks it will gain her happiness. Underneath it all, she's innocent to what she really has in her life but can't see it as she thinks too positively about business. The daughter Jane is an insecure, confused girl who resents her father for not being there for her. As the story goes on, she falls in love with the boy next door as he understands her.<br/><br/>After having enough of living a miserable, slave-like life. Lester decides to make a few changes in his life which will make him happier. The more free he gets, the happier he gets. Turning from a loser to living the American dream, Lester starts to remember his good times as a teenager. He quits his soul less job and starts to stick up for himself when his wife tries to take control of him. Much to Carolyn's anger, Lester starts to gain freedom in his life more then she does.<br/><br/>The ending is a great twist how it demonstrates that Lester is truly happy that he once had a joyful, yet happy family he was grateful for and that he has 'Beauty' in his life that is Carolyn when she was younger used to be different and in love and this movie gives the real established view of everyday life."

","Well, Its arguably one of the most brilliant performances by Kevin Spacey. The devil apparently pulled another great trick. The central storyline revolves around a guy called 'Lester' who works for an advertising agency. The film brings in a lot of musings which redefines 'Crossing the line' issues for every character in the movie that is interestingly woven in an exhilarating plot.<br/><br/>At some level, it boils to an individual's feelings of insecurity and his lookout for his/her companion. Sam Mendes has bought out this 'complex network' with an amazing sense that the viewer empathizes with each character and his conscience."
"tonymurphylee","Null","2","4","29 April 2008"," Top-notch 90s classic
","'American Beauty' is a film that deals with death. The film is about Lester's final months. Lester doesn't know that he will die. We find this out within the first minute of the film. We know this just from the opening shot of his own daughter asking her boyfriend if he could kill him for her. We know right away that he is a loser, a geek, and a terrible father and husband. <br/><br/>The film details the lives of Lester and the people around him. Lester is married to Carolyn, a perfectionist and an emotional woman. Her and Lester hate each other. They are married with a child but they are not in love. Their daughter is Jane, who is spiteful of her parents behavior. Her parents constantly argue and betray each other. Why should she be happy and proud of her parents who aren't particularly supportive of her, though they try to be.<br/><br/>During one of their attempts to be involved more with their daughter's cheerleading, Lester falls for one of her friends, Angela, who he then constantly tries to woo and impress. This eventually leads him to change himself into the person he thinks that he wants to be. Meanwhile, the family has new neighbors. Frank, the homophobic father of Ricky, who is in love with Jane and videotapes her through his window. When Ricky becomes friends with Lester, Frank begins to suspect that he is gay. <br/><br/>'American Beauty' does something that isn't done enough in American films today. It actually makes us feel for the characters. None of these characters are bad people. Their decisions are bad, but all any of them want is for things to work out for themselves. They are all very good people. They just got too caught up in what they think society wants them to do or doesn't want them to do, though Lester rebels instead. He is sick of how society treats him and how everybody treats him. He goes a different way than he is expected and attempts to become his own person. He lusts after a teenager, despite the fact that he is middle-aged. A lot of middle-aged people secretly do this, however, it's only a serious problem if they act out on their desires. Does Lester do this? It's a difficult question to answer, though I guess, in a sense, he doesn't. But why does he lust after her? Does he lust after her because he is beautiful or because she is a mirror image of what beauty is supposed to apparently look like? <br/><br/>Carolyn is an interesting character. She tries incredibly hard to sell a house at her job and berates herself for failing. Is she past the point in which she isn't able to even feel anything anymore? Has she become that numb to her problems? These people are not close and their marriage doesn't mean anything. The only people in the whole movie who are actually happy are their two gay neighbors. <br/><br/>Jane wants breast augmentation surgery, but why? Her breasts already look pretty big. Does she think that people will like her if her breasts look fake? If they were any bigger, that's what they would look like. Why does she feel that people wants girls that look fake. She is already lusted after by Ricky. Ricky, at first, appears to be a really strange person. Angela speaks of rumors involving him going to a mental asylum. They may or may not be true, but that's not the point. The point is that he is unashamed of who he is and this makes him an interesting character to compare with all the other characters. <br/><br/>His father doesn't seem to realize that his son is on to his mental tricks and that Ricky only tells him what he wants to hear rather than speaking his mind about the issues that he brings up. Frank doesn't really hate homosexuals, but the way he was brought up allows him to think that way. This is especially evident in a surreal scene toward the end. <br/><br/>What I haven't mentioned is the sheer intensity of the film and the events leading up to the death of Lester. Indeed, the last thirty minutes of the film remain very suspenseful and revealing. They are full of so many bizarre coincidences and misinterpretations that it's actually quite funny to watch at times. It's a painful final act, but it's also a surprisingly insightful depiction and comment on loneliness and being hopeless in troubles. The last ten minutes are surprisingly honest and unique in that the viewer feels enlightened when, in reality, the things we are told are things we all know but don't realize that we know any of it until we are reminded by a film like this. <br/><br/>Do people need to watch films like this? Absolutely. How else are we able to be reminded of what we know about human existence. The things that are brought to light in the final minutes are not things we learn, but rather things we know and pick up on when we are infants and are developing. As babies, we make mistakes and learn from them. We don't remember those mistakes, but we remember what we know. <br/><br/>The philosophy behind this film is that a lot of us were brought up to not make mistakes and to learn what the parents and teachers teach in elementary school and in our early years as humans. But in this being done, we are not able to develop into our own people. Instead, we take what we can get, use it, and then grow up having learned nothing except that we should only know certain things. 'American Beauty' is one of the ideal examples of brilliant film-making."

","I'm not a critic, and don't know any more about the process of film-making than what I've garnered from years of watching movies, but I know what I like, and I know what art is, and this movie is truly art. One of the many things it's about is the masks we all wear, and how well they protect the secrets that they were designed to hide. It touched me, excited me, made me so restless to explore the concepts within it that I didn't sleep much the night I saw it because my mind was so super-charged with ideas. It forced me to look at myself and everyone around me in a way I had neglected, or shied away from in the past. It gave me a new perspective - made me wonder if those masks we all so carefully-craft to protect us are really that: protection, or a prison we can't escape from. It changed me, and that's a priceless gift. I think Alan Ball's screenplay was genius, and Sam Mendes deftly drew something amazing out of the fine actors who populate this film, and then served it up unflinchingly. I am grateful for this movie. It will always be in my top ten. It's why I look at art-read-watch movies-listen to music...because there is always the chance - the perfect hope - that I will feel something like what American Beauty made me feel."

","What was interesting to me is how many of my family and some friends found the characters I especially likedLester, Ricky, and Jane to be degenerate or at least lacking in social graces. The most common objection was to the older man Lester Burnham lusting after the teenage girl, as if that kind of desire, urge, or longing is by itself proof of depravity of this man and, maybe, all men: ""No way is Lester Burnham a good guy. No sympathy. Case closed, and how could anyone possibly like the movie?!"" <br/><br/>Or if your critic is a fan of drug prohibition, then he or she is going to see Ricky Fits' unapologetic use and sale of the demon weed (he only uses G-13, the federal government-developed strain, going for ""$2000 an ounce"").<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.<br/><br/>Brian Wright Copyright 2008"

","American Beauty follows the narration of Lester Burnham, a completely average middle-aged working man. When he sees his daughter's friend at a cheer-leading display, he becomes instantly attracted to her. His attitude toward life takes a wild turn that impacts the surrounding community, ultimately leading to a tragic conclusion.<br/><br/>While some of the individual segments of the plot are uninteresting, the good parts come together to make a compelling story. The snippets of Burnham and his new mentality are simply priceless; from the moment he quits his business job to the scenes revolving around his new job at McDonalds, it never fails to satisfy. It brings to light a more enjoyable and funny concept of the movie: the rejection of a ""boring"" life to ultimately have more satisfaction with oneself. Kevin Spacey excels as Burnham and deserves his Oscar win of best actor. Chris Cooper perfectly fits the character of Colonel Frank Fits. The rest of the cast is also convincing, although some of the teenagers could have been better played. The ending is brilliantly crafted and involves all the previous content that was introduced in the film.<br/><br/>The usage of colors (mostly red) and symbolism (mostly regarding roses) is wonderful. It helps develop some of the nuances in the themes. Plus it makes the whole visual experience much more effective. The movie touches on many themes are all relevant to everyday life. It takes situations and emotions that we can relate with, and plays them to the extreme.<br/><br/>It all comes together to make a visually and emotionally effective movie. It can be analyzed for the deep messages on intriguing themes or can be enjoyed at face value. American Beauty is by no means flawless, but it elaborates on themes and emotions in a way that few other movies can. Recommended for all viewers."

A holocaust; a black plague. An experience that chews at the thin fabric of sanity like a sanity-eating rat until we're left wrapped into a fetal position on the theater floor, hugging the cool concrete for comfort in a pool of our blood and vomit, our skin bathed in cold sweat; our muscles twitching.

For the most part, reality is not this harsh, not this glaring. People live with each other, see their faults, love them or not, but this desolate despair from emotionally stunted jerks that this movie portrays as being the norm, it's almost deliberately dishonest. If that is truly the experience of the people behind this film, I feel sorry for them. It's not that way for most people. Maybe if you are a teenager you experience life that way in your immaturity. <br/><br/>An obvious hatred for what the makers of this film deem to be the morally bankrupt lifestyle of many Americans, overly consumed by the material and appearance. Everything in this world is bad. It only becomes good when they do things that are not only insane, but wholly irresponsible in people that have children that they should be caring for. Sorry, but I don't think it's acceptable to actualize yourself at the expense of your daughter. <br/><br/>Does this happen in suburbia? To be sure. But it disturbs me to see so many people talking about how realistic this movie is, it just simply isn't.<br/><br/>Furthermore, some of the stereotypes, such as Ricky's homophobic marine father who turns out to be gay himself, are embarrassingly trite, pat, and roll your eyes predictable.<br/><br/>Having said that, there are also incredibly moving scenes in this picture. Ricky's description of the beauty of a plastic bag flying about in the wind will stay with me for a long time. It is one of the most lyrical, powerful and lovely moments I have ever seen on film.<br/><br/>Also the ending, where the sometimes repulsive Lester has an epiphany and finally grows up is quite wonderful.<br/><br/>Should you see it? Yes. But don't expect a masterpiece."

","This movie has many intertwining factors to it. For one the different sanctions of the American public are basically put as a jigsaw puzzle in this movie & its up to the audience to decide where those pieces fit together. Kevin Spacey again delivers with a tour de force performance as Lester Burnham, an out of touch office worker who seems to be void of any interests. Spacey's character is somewhat of a sarcastic metaphor for the effect that routine has on our lives. Annette Bening is also at her best as the perfect housewife, Carolyn who can only adapt to a lifestyle where she is in complete control. When Lester hits a strange mid-life crisis triggered by his daughters best friend, Angela (Mina Suvari) everything in his neat little world begins to unravel.<br/><br/>As their marriage hits rock bottom, Carolyn makes a grave error when she falls into a passionate romance with an opposing real estate worker. Their daughter, Jane (Thora Birch) also quickly becomes an outcast when she falls in love with an eccentric teen on drugs (Wes Bentley) who's emotionally distant father (Chris Cooper) likes to voice his negative opinions of homosexuals. This movie is so mixed up it would be almost impossible to judge the predictability of the film's ending yet you are so intrigued to know how it will all end up! The film will lead you to believe that in all this anarchy & chaos their is ""beauty"" but in my opinion it just ends up with more perversity! If you enjoyed watching Crash (2004) or Babel (2006) you may have a little bit of an insight into multi-layered story-lines. What really makes this film a classic is the fantastic dynamics of all the characters & what social message they present. Definitely worth seeing but be prepared to face some issues that are beyond your own reasoning! A good way to end the 20th century with an internal thought provoking film.<br/><br/>4.5/5"

","Note to self: The next time you see a movie and hate it watch it again. Like Swingers and Sideways I detested this movie upon first viewing. Something drew me back for a second viewing and, ironically, I now watch it every time I need to be cheered up.<br/><br/>I can't think of a movie since Ordinary People that captures white upper middle class America as perfectly as American Beauty. In Ordinary People a family is torn apart by a tragedy. A son's death. In American Beauty a family is slowly being torn apart by a different kind of tragedy. Every day life.<br/><br/>Lester Burnham is a 42 year old white male who has been completely sedated by the rut of every day life. His wife Carolyn seemingly has everything a person could want, but is totally miserable. Together they have raised one daughter, Jane, who they are clearly out of touch with.<br/><br/>What makes this movie work so well for me is how close it is to reality for a lot of people. There seems to be an abundance of people who clearly seem disappointed by life (Lester) or are chasing the next thing that will make them happy (Carolyn). Lester chooses a more dramatic solution to the problem. He quits his job, black mails his former employer, trades his family car in for a Firebird, starts smoking pot with the kid next door and begins to lust after his daughter's best friend, Angela. Carolyn takes her frustrations out by having an affair and blows off steam by going to the shooting range to pop off a few rounds.<br/><br/>The tag line for the movie was ""Look Closer"" and I couldn't think of a better way to pitch this movie. Upon initial viewing the characters seem typical if not familiar. The movie truly requires multiple viewings to see the depth of the story and the characters.<br/><br/>Like a lot of movies that have seemingly basic plots what makes American Beauty rise above the rest is a phenomenal cast. Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening play the roles of the miserably married Lester and Carolyn perfectly. Chris Cooper does a superb job of portraying the ex military gay bashing homosexual neighbor, Col Frank Fits, USMC. A man so disgusted with his own desires that he projects them on to his son, Ricky. No one overacts their roles and all seem to understand the characters they are supposed to be playing. One of those movies that is a ""treat"" to watch.<br/><br/>I live in Naperville, Illinois. One of the largest suburbs of Chicago and possibly the most white upper middle class community in this country. I find myself driving through neighborhoods looking at gorgeous homes with seemingly happy families thinking, ""There's a lot more going on behind closed doors than people think."" And I do believe that is one of the points American Beauty is trying to make. That and life is what you make of it."

","Hadn't seen the film for three or four years until I watched it again last night. A thread in the discussion board wondering whether the film isn't over-rated got me responding and eventually I decided to post here instead. <br/><br/>It's difficult to see where American Beauty doesn't quite mesh, as it's blessed with brilliant performers like Cooper and Bening supporting a brave piece of work by Kevin Spacey, who puts his golden voice to work with autumnal beauty as well as truly inventive notes of sarcasm.<br/><br/>We've seen a lot of movies since this one using elements of magic realism, particularly the serendipity of gathering together unlikely plot and character threads,surprisingly triumphant again this year with Crash (2005), which to my mind didn't accomplish it half so well as Magnolia(2000) or the much earlier Altman opus, Short Cuts (1993). It's a difficult trick to manage without seeming contrived, and to me, here, it fails.<br/><br/>Partly it annoyed me because I felt some of the story arcs were merely limned into form, with me expected to fill in the rest of, well, the cliché. For example, imagine how dull an extensive treatment of Cooper's latent homosexuality and his son's repressive nature would be; no, we wouldn't wish Sam Mendes to have developed this further, the point being that we'd feel that way because we've seen it all before - here Mendes doesn't have anything to add to that facet of the narrative. Apply the same test to the father/daughter, husband/wife, Humbert/Lolita, midlife crisis angsts and we are left wondering what at all is fresh about the movie? <br/><br/>And while I'm complaining about sketchiness I find myself paradoxically lamenting the overt preachiness of the script, the achilles heel of virtually all American studio Serious Films, which are never satisfied when an idea is simply felt and understood, but must rather be stated like a polemic or with all the moral certitude of a lawyer's jury summation. Watch this film and then Capote (2005)for contrast - the motifs thread their way ever so lightly through the latter, subtly suggesting, challenging, provoking, drawing us further into the mysteries of complex natures rather than staking them out like the sectioned specimens of von Hagens Body Worlds exhibit. Is the comparison fair when American Beauty is on one level at least a satire? I think so, when Mendes' ultimate intent is to teach us something profound about our modern life.<br/><br/>A single case of the false notes that are struck, the telegraphing to the audience: Lester finds his nymphet, Angela, weeping in a corner, and comforts her with his restored virility and self-assurance. His conquest complete, he begins to undress her when she blurts out the inevitable, predictable fact of her virginity. Now, Lester has been shown to be an intelligent, re-invigorated and thus keenly observant man. Yet the fact that she lay beneath him visibly trembling and almost squirming with a look of terror in her eyes for upwards of thirty seconds seems to have escaped him completely. Why? For the simple cinematic necessity that the viewer discover it first, to render his shock, the crushing of his randy hopes and his quick restoration in himself of a fatherly humanity all the more compelling. This is all very nice, but it ain't truth.<br/><br/>I still like the film. You can't beat Spacey's poetic narration and his commitment to the role. There's Bening's face-smacking melt-down and heroically regained composure - and a tangible wistfulness pervading the whole, gorgeously, emblematically captured as Ricky and Jane watch his film of the grocery bag caught in a courtyard eddy.<br/><br/>It's memorable for its defining moments, and that's still saying a lot, and bests much of whatever else people are forced to watch in the narrow-casting of today's Cineplex."

","""Close on a single, dewy American Beauty rose, perfect in shape and colour. As we pull back, a pair of gloved hands with clippers appear and snip the flower off.<br/><br/>We continue pulling back to discover Carolyn Burnham""<br/><br/>This is an excerpt from the script to the film ""American Beauty"", and in this small piece of text accurately portrays one of the meanings of the story of this film, something as beautiful as a perfect red rose, symbolising life, love and passion, being cut off left to wither away and eventually die. Sam Mendes, the film's director, mentioned that ""Red roses are a symbol of Carolyn, a symbol of his (Lester's) other life"", throughout the movie red roses and dark crimson colours dominate nearly every scene in some aspect.<br/><br/>The film ""American Beauty"" deals with many issues of modern suburban life in middle-class America, but the main issue that it seems to confronted is how people who live these suburban lives can feel trapped, isolated, and worst of all, absolutely helpless to get back the joy that they once had. <br/><br/>This film is about one suburban man, Lester Burnham; played by Kevin Spacey, who breaks free from his entrapping suburban life and starts to take control, and for once in a long time, do what he really wants to do even if that means quitting his monotonous job, buying a 1970 Pontiac Firebird, smoking weed, doing weights and working in a fast-food shop a job with as little responsibilities as possible. The scriptwriter of ""American Beauty"", Alan Ball, sums this up in one quote; ""the movie is about people who are searching for the meaning in their lives"".<br/><br/>The conflict in the film was actually hard to pick out, because there was so much conflict and tension between so many of the characters already, not to mention to conflict that is shown between the individual and society, when looking at it on a large scale. Throughout the film the main conflicts are of Lester and his wife Carolyn, Lester and his job, Ricky Fits (Lester's dealer and daughter's boyfriend) and his dad last of all Ricky's dad, Col. Frank Fits; played by Chris Cooper, and himself, as shown later in the movie.<br/><br/>The tag line to the movie is ""Look closer"", this does not mean scan each scene and use a digital zoom to look for some hidden meaning. Even though there are many important features hidden in the background of the film, the meaning of ""Look closer"" is that sometimes we need to stop and just look at something to find the meaning and beauty of it, as many people in America are always in such a rush to do things they cannot see these things because they aren't looking. <br/><br/>Alan Ball commented on the meaning of ""looking closer""; ""Beauty is in the strangest places. A piece of garbage floating in the wind, and that beauty exists here in America. It exists everywhere. You have to develop an eye for it to be able to see it.""<br/><br/>""American Beauty"" deals with the issue that modern American people no longer have the time available to then to enjoy simple things in life, they have placed material goods over the joys of being alive. This is seen in a scene in the film when Lester and his wife Carolyn manage to briefly rekindle their love life, but just as Lester is about to kiss Carolyn she stops him because he was about to spill beer on their six-thousand dollar couch. Gone, the passion is once more destroyed my Carolyn's materialism.<br/><br/>Climax comes at a point near the end of the film, it is as all things seem to be coming to an end, the older characters have ended their journeys, whilst the younger characters have only just begun theirs. <br/><br/>In the last few scenes of the movie Lester is shown to know that his story is ending, but keeping to aspects and conventions of a tragedy, he does nothing about it. Lester gets an opportunity to fulfil his fantasy with his daughter Jane's friend, Angela; played by Mena Suvari, but when she tells him that she is a virgin he realises how old he really is, and the paternal side of him comes out. That is the end of his fantasy, the end of his journey of self discovery and also, to an extent, the end of Angela's journey as well, because she is exposed to the viewers and herself of who and what she really is, not what she makes her self out to be to other people.<br/><br/>The viewers are positioned to believe that Carolyn is going to do something exceptional, but her opportunity is spoiled by Frank Fits. At this point both Frank and Carolyn have also ended their journeys, the end product; Lester is dead, a hole blown into the back of his head.<br/><br/>In a conclusion I have to say that even though I enjoyed ""America Beauty"" I had troubles with it because of the sheer amounts of content possessed in the film, every single scene had an important point, comment or meaning to it, whether it reflected characters in the film, influences the story of the film, or comments on the real world there was always something to be seen or made out.<br/><br/>Directed by: Sam Mendes.

","American Beauty gives a deep insight into the lives of Americans on a different levels. And more importantly it emphasises with God's beauty that is all pervasive around us while we are blinded owing to materialistic aspirations.<br/><br/>A typical American family of Burnham's consisting of Lester (Kevin Spacey), Carolynn (Annette) and their daughter Jane (Thora Birch). Marriage is superfluous. Daughter is confused teenager who falls in love with neighbour Ricky (Wes). The pro-sake life of Lester suddenly gets spiced up when he falls head-over-heels over his daughter's friend Angels (Mena Suvari) and re-discovers his passion for life, a reason for existence and more importantly his identity.<br/><br/>All the character's parts are well-etched out. The portrayal of Lester's re-kindling his energy is portrayed effectively, as subtle and as convincingly as one falls in first love.<br/><br/>And narrative voice-over words of Kevin Spacey are extremely spiritual yet convincing. The movie did not register well the first time I watched it. However last week when it was aired on telly, and could see the subtle messages the movie is interlaced with."

","The main focus that was taught about ""American Beauty"" was that it was ""Reality vs. Appearance"". I think that the entire movie was scene though a lens. It was obvious that Ricky taped everything and saw everything in his video camera; but the rest of the movie was seen and talked by a dead narrator. This is related to everyday life for some people and it showed a story through experience. I also strongly agree that Angela is a symbol in the movie, and she represents Lester's old wife, and the way his wife used to be. He fantasizes about Angela, and whenever he thinks about her there are always roses in the scene. Lester sees how Carolyn used to be through the representation of Angela. There is definitely a comparison of these two women throughout the film."

No, academy award is supposed to be lower case as I have stopped considering them an actual awards show since this film won best picture. I figured that Titanic must have been a fluke and they were really sorry for that one.<br/><br/>Of course that's not the case. People actually like this tale of a man in a serious midlife crisis lusting after a teenage girl, and his adulterous wife cheating on him. And his daughter hooking up with the art freak drug dealer next door. Okay, we have a movie here. It could be a decent one.<br/><br/>But when you meet the art freak's father he acts so homophobic you can just say ""Yep. He's Gay.""

And yet the book is passed off as some sort of abstract art.

","I respect the significance of a film like American Beauty, but when people start babbling on about getting great deep things from it, it really gets my back up.  For the uninitiated, American Beauty is another one of those ""let's blow the cover off middle-class suburbia and expose the yuppies for the disturbed, demented, unhappy, pathetic losers they truly are"" movies, sort of like ""The Graduate"" for our times.  In fact, the filmmakers are guilty of the same sort of hypocrisy they profess to satirize.<br/><br/>
      I always have a big problem when filmmakers set out to expose middle-class life, then depict every single character as a neurotic or an aspiring nutcase.  The truth is, American Beauty is no more an accurate depiction of suburbia than ""Father Knows Best"".  If you were to show suburbia as it truly is, you have to show the characters as so empty and so mind-numbingly boring the audience would either walk out or fall asleep. But then again, isn't that the reason suburbanites flock to the movies in the first place, to escape their private humdrum?<br/><br/>
      I won't rehash the whole movie, but on the finer points:  since the story is told from the point of view of Kevin Spacey's character, everything he does is presented as heroic; when he shrewdly scams his corrupt employer for 60 grand then spends it on a hot car, or leaves his dull office job to work at Burger King (because he likes it), we're supposed to cheer him on, as we would a rebellious teenager.  Which is fine, except this guy has a home and a family and a mortgage, and he's neglecting all of them. Selfishness is cool.  Then when he gets a chance at sex with the high school kid he idolizes (that's rape, by the way), he thinks better of it and refrains.  This is supposed to be Spacey Doing The Right Thing.  It is not. It is Spacey Not Doing The Wrong Thing (if I refrain from committing murder, can I get the key to the city?).  Annette Bening's character is presented is bad because she's materialistic and a shrew.  When she and Spacey attempt to make love on a sofa, she frets because he might spill his can of beer on it and ruin the upholstery; this puts the ki-bosh on he whole affair.  But isn't a lot of what she stands for just simple adult responsibility (disguised by the filmmakers as kooky fanaticism).  Neither of them are good parents to their daughter; Spacey doesn't care, Bening only postures at caring, but at least she puts an effort into posturing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>      There are so many ways to pick this movie apart, because it touches people on so many levels, but what are the filmmakers trying to say?  It seems like they're espousing the old Timothy Leary mantra of tune in, turn on and drop out.  Just start a little Haight-Ashbury behind your own picket fence and everything will be all right.  The irony about their idea of ""exposure"" is that audiences aren't embarrassed by it; that is, they don't feel ""fingered"", as it were.  Instead, they respond in the most positive ways; they relate to the characters or they'll say ""I know someone who's just like that"" (even I know someone who's a lot like the gay Marine colonel) .  Maybe one day someone will come along and expose the filmmakers, these so-called truth-tellers as the stupid shallow cretins THEY are.  I would guess that they consider teens and young adults as its target audience, because only someone who hasn't lived would be a sucker for this trash.  American Beauty is a trashy movie, reeking of pot smoke and glorified rape fantasies.  2** out of 4"

I am probably one of the most open minded people and I watched this film with an open mind hoping and praying that it would get better every moment longer that I watched.  And I'll tell you what, it didn't.<br/><br/>This man Lester (Kevin Spacey) is going through a midlife crisis, the highpoint of his day is when he wanks off in the shower.  He lives his life in fear of doing what he wants and conforms to be the person his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) wants him to be.  See she's shagging not her husband but Buddy Kaine the Real-estate King (Peter Gallagher) her business's competition.  Their daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is the average misunderstood child, and her dad fantasizes about her friend Angela (Mena Suvari) so much that Jane says to Rickey (Wes Bentley), their new next door neighbor (he's her age) ""It'd be nice if I was anywhere near as important to him as she is.""  Rickey is your average guy; his hobby is filming things, has lots of groovy high tech equipment, his parent's are a little nutty, and yet he still manages to be a very successful drug dealer. And this my friends is what Hollywood thinks your average middle class suburb is like.<br/><br/>I watched the film again to make sure that my inner cynic hadn't missed the point (Like the tag line: I ""looked closer,"" and closer, and closer, and closer)I hadn't missed the point.  First the fantasy scenes were overused and very cliché.  Next I couldn't help but chuckle about half of what Hollywood thought it was like growing up in a middle class suburb.  In fact you could say I found this film almost offending, coming from a middle class suburb myself.  The characters were very unrealistic, maybe this is because everyone was over-acting, maybe... but I highly doubt it.  The only character who had realistic qualities was the daughter Jane, (on Rickey being sent away)""well they can't put you away just for saying weird things,"" one of the only realistic statements in the entire film, but even her character lost that off-hand reality.  The ending was a rushed, sloppy, mess making one after another thing fall creating a over-dramatized tragedy. The ending is predictable and the dialog is unconvincing, despite the fact that the film was sloppy seconds the soundtrack was fairly well written and constructed, but even that couldn't save it.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film I wouldn't recommend it."

","This is a beautifully crafted *bad* film. On the plus side Sam Mendes seems to really understand actors and draws sympathetic, detailed performances from each actor. The film's problems are almost entirely attributable to the story and screenplay.<br/><br/>The film attempts to support the premise that someone can reclaim their soul by regressing to an immature, selfish, essentially adolescent position in the world. What is amazing and fascinating is how convincing this message is being received by (a proportion of) audiences despite the lack of conviction in the writing.<br/><br/>For example, a key line is the moment when Lester chastises his wife's materialism saying ""This isn't life, this is just STUFF!"". But only moments previously we have seen him enjoying his new remote-control toy car, and know that he has just indulged himself in a new car. It appears that it's only 'stuff' when it belongs to someone else.<br/><br/>This contradiction and implied selfishness is passed over casually without notice or comment by director and author - apparently insensitive to the dynamic subtleties they encourage us to ""look closer"" at. Similarly moral boundaries are crossed indifferently. What kind of creative artist doesn't bother to acknowledge moral transgression as a device to generate an audience response? It doesn't matter whether the author approves or disapproves that boundaries are crossed - it's part of their craft to plot a course through the moral landscape it presents, because that's important to the audience. Yet Lester's blackmailing, inappropriate lust, and drug taking are presented as equivalents to playing loud rock-music whilst out driving. In what purports to be serious drama, that's just sloppy narration.<br/><br/>None of the women characters are permitted any moral redemption.

Perhaps this is another clue that the author lacks the finer sentiments needed to set a moral lead for a generation.<br/><br/>""As Good as It Gets"" more surely, convincingly and funnily tells a tale of moral redemption. ""All About My Mother"" startlingly vividly and more humanly shows people struggling to make meaning in a dysfunctional existence, and the standard for American suburban social satire is set by ""The Simpsons"".<br/><br/>I enjoyed the texture of the film, but it amounted to nothing and I was all too glad to get back on the street, feel the sunshine, smell the air, and touch the pavement again."

","Perhaps I am dating myself, which at 28 is rapidly becoming easy to do, but I can remember a time in movie history when 17-year-old actresses were not required to appear as partially nude nymphettes in order to tantalize the audience, and the hero of a movie was honorable.  ""That's the point; there are no heros in this movie"" is what some might argue, but I disagree. We were supposed to find Lester's cynicism and disdain amusing, like a child's tantrum. And our ethical hero acted chivalrously after all: after he had seduced his daughter's 16-year-old so-called friend (or she him), he chose not to take advantage of her merely because she admitted to being a virgin. Annette Bening's character, however, was quite believable and though she was painfully neurotic, at least she felt a sense of responsibility for keeping things together--even if superficially so. This movie did resort to a few cliches, like the gay homophobic ex-Marine, and the timing of the final seduction scene--pan to crying, vulnerable nymphette; enter Lester the Molester. OK, it's time now to get off my soapbox. It just saddens me to see how popular this movie is, and that the audiences want more."

","There are few films, and I have seen quite a number, that have made such an immediate impact on me as American Beauty. As soon as I had seen it I was certain it was something a bit special. Most of the widely acclaimed ""classics"" have the special combination of a very strong storyline complimented by fantastic & complex characters (i.e. The Godfather). Alternately, American Beauty's strength rests entirely on it's wonderful characters, as there is no specific story line to speak of - it is merely a snap shot into the life of an interesting (to say the least!) and apparently ""regular"" American family.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the movie's charm lies in the fact that no matter what the age and social status of the viewer, there are characters, or mannerisms of the characters, that the audience can identify with. For instance, Lester's contempt for the man he has become, for the life he has, that seems to have crept up on him without him even knowing or realising it. Or Janie's resentment for her parents - for their selfishness and apparent lack of genuine interest in anything she does. There must surely be countless middle aged men or angst ridden teenagers around the civilised world who could identify with such situations/feelings?<br/><br/>For me, the truly unique quality of this film, was that after watching it and becoming completely engrossed in the wonderful array of characters it introduces us to, I actually took a little look at myself, at my life and asked a few questions that I hadn't consciously considered before...<br/><br/>Movies that have such an impact are few and far between. Original and brilliant, I can think of few others that so genuinely deserve the 10/10 grade."

","American Beauty (1999) Starring Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening.  Running time: 121 minutes.  Rated R for strong sexuality, language, violence and drug content.<br/><br/>Meet Lester Burnham(Kevin Spacey).  He's 42 and he's having a mid-life crisis.  His marriage to his wife Carolyn(Annette Bening) is on the verge of falling apart and his daughter Jane(Thora Birch) hates him.  One night while at a basketball game, Lester spots Jane's friend Angela(Mena Suvari). Lester immediately falls in love.  He then decides that this will be his last chance at true happiness in his life.  So he quits his job and begins working out.  On a minor note, Jane falls in love with the boy who lives next door named Ricky Fitts(Wes Bentley) whose father, Colonel Frank Fitts(Chris Cooper) is a homophobe.<br/><br/>This is indeed the best movie of 1999.  Kevin Spacey has never been better on film.  He really deserved the Oscar for Best Actor.  I'm surprised that he was able to top his Oscar-winning performance as Verbal Kint from ""The Usual Suspects"" in 1995 because many actors are rarely able to top a performance.  Annette Bening was great also as the obsessive and frustrated Carolyn who later decides that enough is enough and goes to sleep with a rival realtor.  The supporting performances are great as well especially from Thora Birch who befriends Ricky.  She at first hates him because he's always filming her, as he says that he finds her interesting and later falls in love with him.  Wes Bentley should have gotten an Oscar nomination for his performance as the troubled and misunderstood Ricky.  <br/><br/>
I really liked this movie a lot.  I missed it when it was released into theaters.  I didn't get a chance to see it until it came on HBO last year. <br/><br/>

"emverano","Null","2","4","6 October 2001"," A Timeless Masterpiece Disguised As a Simple Satire
","Since the 1980's American movie audience has been inundated with mindless movies in which macho stars blow up dozens of buildings and machine-gun down hundreds of villains and their underlings.  However, I am glad to see that both critics and movie audience understood and greatly appreciated `American Beauty,' a recent movie which deeply explored the meaning of reality using methods employed by cinematic giants like Federico Fellini and Akira Kurosawa.<br/><br/>""American Beauty"" innocently and rather deceptively starts with a satirical portrayal of an ""average"" American family (with commonplace problems like the parents' mid-life career frustrations and uneasy relationship with the rebellious teen-age daughter).  However, soon after the movie begins, the viewer is faced with a foreshadowing and suspense of an impending disaster. As the movie progresses, the ""average"" family deteriorates into drug use, adultery and murder conspiracy, and the viewer begins to realize that the problem posed by this movie is not confined to the predicaments experienced by this ""average"" family.  The real problem is with the fundamental flaw in the modern American value system--its social convention, morality and what is expected of an average member of the society.  Moreover, through the use of Fellinesque fantasy sequences, rich use of cinematic symbolism and cinematic warping of time and space, this movie even questions our perception of reality.  That is to say, the movie shows us alternative ways of perceiving reality and confronts us with the fact that reality (or the perception of reality) is wholly subservient to our psyche.<br/><br/>
""American Beauty"" is a rightful descendant of masterpieces like Kurosawa's `Rashomon' and Fellini's `8 ½,' which redefined the meaning of reality. This movie is a timeless masterpiece, and the critical and public acclaim showered on this movie is well-deserved."

","The Best: Annette Benning,  the smashing majority of the characters, the plot providing an actual satire and the touching directing The Worst: Kevin Spacey's office blackmail seemed came out of Fight Club'. The darker parts of the movie might be boring to some viewers, but those who think that are the ones haven't plunged completely into it. Rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Alike millions of Americans, the Burnhams have a easy life in a nice house with green grass and a white fence in the outskirts of a big city. Lester, Carolyn and Jane Burnham are an attractive and kind family, but behind this apparent ideal life is hidden a big dysfunction. Lester, the narrator, reveals us that he hates his job, his wife ignores him and his daughter despises him. He feels his life completely on the ground but an encounter with his daughter's best friend wakes in him long time sleepy feelings that lead him into a radical change. This is the beginning point of a narrative that chronicles how a loser can become a winner even losing everything.<br/><br/>
The major strength of American Beauty are the well elaborated character interactions, that besides the Burnhams includes a teenager drug consumer/ negotiator, his father a rude ex marine core, Jane's best friend, a real estate manager lover of Carolyn, etc. In his directorial debut, Sam Mendes creates a singular, powerful, and intelligent master piece, about unhappiness, loneliness in the middle age, which tone varies between realism and parody showing Lester's possible redemption of his life, following what his heart tells to reach happiness even if it leads him into a tragic ending. American Beauty his a blast of fresh hair oh the way Hollywood satirises the contemporary society aye resulting in its five Oscars; Best Picture, Director, Leading Actor, Photography and plot."

"tommythegun","Null","2","4","8 January 2001"," This is why people deride Hollywood...
","And I'm from LA too!<br/><br/>I hated this movie.  Why?  To tell the God's honest truth, I can't entirely tell why.  It's not poorly produced or directed or acted.  In fact, it's rather well made as a film.  The acting is quite good from such a stellar cast.  The symbolism and nuance and shading is quite deep.<br/><br/>No, I hate this movie because of the message, if it has one, that it conveys, what the writer was trying to say, the way it portrayed people, what this movie means and why Hollywood likes this film.<br/><br/>Basically, this film is a quite frank, and I would say somewhat fearful, message from Hollywood about what it thinks about people and what they ought to be.  Hollywood hates suburbia, normalcy, families, convential sexuality, the people who were popular in high school, the military, etc., etc., etc. So, their response, lets show them for what they ""really"" are.  Let's say that they're all repressed and degenerate and we are the normal, good, healthy people.  Of course, none of this is reality.  Hollywood is, especially at the ""creative"" level, populated by the quiet artsy kids who spent too much time alone in high school and came to Tinseltown as refugees so need to fire a backshot here.  This was this movie's inside joke to it's own, ""See, those people out there in Middle America aren't so normal and happy.  They are shallow, lonely, screwed up, full of hate and angst, etc. They should ditch the kids, move out here, get a pair of leather pants and a big bag of pills and do what will make them 'happy'.""  This message is pretty thickly laid on from the get-go, and it reeks of agenda, of having been written by someone filled with fear and urgency about communicating this ""message"".  This is why the movie got the Oscar, Hollywood got the joke, got the message, and appreciated it, appreciated deluding themselves into believing that maybe they really aren't so out of touch and that everyone out there on the other side of the screen is also trapped in adolescence and hedonism but since they're repressed about it, it's the people at night on Santa Monica Boulevard who are ""normal"".  It was a major shot in the culture war here, and apparently Hollywood will never be disabused of it's own circular logic, since any dissent is simply dismissed as the ""surface level"" or ""living in the '50s"" and we are all required to ""look closer"" at what Hollywood thinks.<br/><br/>I'm reminded of what Oscar Levant said about Hollywood: ""Beneath the phony tinsel of Hollywood lies the real tinsel.""<br/><br/>Some spoilers below.<br/><br/>Watching this film, yes, I can pick out everything I don't like.  But, just in the general sense, I get a nagging nauseousness and uneasiness watching this.  It's just something in the film, something about degeneracy and irresponsibility at every turn.  I really wonder how anyone could actually contrive some picture of life where no one is mentally above the age of 13. The writer obviously wasn't.  No one in this film seems to be able to think more than 5 seconds down the road, look deeply within themselves or do the work with themselves or do much more than react, rather than act to their circumstances.  And the characters, all, without fail, were at best one-dimensional.  They were nothing more than cardboard cut-outs, archetypes from what someone thought they were supposed to be.  We have the not-happy, burned-out dad in the middle of a midlife crisis who snaps and just wants to do his own thing, the mom obsessed with the nice house and finding her own inner ""strength"" (""I had to grow up in a duplex!""), the normal daughter caught in the middle, the flirty, sex-obssessed cheerleader tart who, big surprise, is still a virgin despite all her bluster, the creepy, film-student kid who can't see ugliness anywhere, the big, tough, I-hate-homos-but-secretly-am-one (another big shocker), Marine officer, and all the rest.  In a general sense, I didn't like, on a personal level, anyone in this film, couldn't identify or understand a one of them.  It hit me when I realized that there isn't one character in this film, if they were a real person, that I would want to know.<br/><br/>No real creative thought or originality was put into these characters. They were, in the most basic and dry sense of the word, placed there simply to send a message, used as vehicles for an agenda, and not as characters in and of themselves.  The flirty cheerleader and the colonel are my favorite. The girl is unoriginal as hell, the joke told in every neighborhood.  And the colonel, is both an inside joke for homosexuals and liberals and serves to send the ""we hate the military and masculinity"" message from Hollywood. Also, note that the two homosexual couples shown in the neighborhood seem to be the only normal, well-adjusted people in the film (although they're only shown for a few minutes each).<br/><br/>I almost wondered about this film in the way people talk about Hollywood and it's liberal Bolshevik agenda.  But, in that sense, this film was a failure in the sense that it was clumsily executed.  This movie shows that the culture war has gotten to the point where Hollywood's bolshies are simply too far away from the people they are trying to propagandize to be effective, they can no longer craft something that can be understood and accepted by the population.  This isn't the sort of sneaky, tightly crafted, New Institute of Social Research Frankfurt School stalking-horse sort of thing that the media could do in the 30s to destroy Western culture.  This film paints in too-broad strokes and comes out too obvious and strong in its attempt, too far away from people at large and their lives, and so it misses the mark.  Hollywood got the joke with this film, so they gave it an Oscar, but Middle America wouldn't.<br/><br/>That's why this got the Oscar, Hollywood reacted to a message it wanted to hear, wanted to be flattered by, and so goofed.  Like I said, it's a pretty clear shot in the culture war, how far they've degenerated away from anything American or normal.  This isn't culture.<br/><br/>BTW, a little footnote, things can get funny in a cultural war when they start moving in both directions.  We don't totally notice this sort of sly, under-the-radar sort of maneuvering, but not everyone in ""the industry"" has become totally corrupt.  If you watch the Oscars, Mel Gibson, maybe Hollywood's best ""stealth conservative"", was presenting the Best Screenplay Oscar, which went to this film.  When Alan Ball, the Broadway-veteran writer (which tells the whole story about him and why he wrote this film...) came up, note that ole Mel didn't shake his hand, want to get close to him, and seemed distinctly uncomfortable around him.  Surprise, surprise!  This from the producer and star of Braveheart and The Patriot.  Funny indeed!"
"w_brianna","Null","2","4","23 August 2000"," Disturbing, depressing, irritating.
","Spoilers below.<br/><br/>American Beauty is one of the most depressing, yet pointless movies I've ever seen. It's well made (acting, directing, cinematography), but the story and the dialog is over-simplified, highly unrealistic, stereotipical and preachy. <br/><br/>Perhaps because I too am not an American, but of European background, I couldn't for the life of me identify with any of the characters. Spoilt and vacant is the only way I can describe them. And yes, this is somewhat the point of the movie, or is it? What is it's point? That life the way we (or Americans) are taught to strive for (nice house, job, car, child) is so meaningless, empty and rotten, that we'll either go insane or want to be dead? <br/><br/>""There's nothing worse than being ordinary"" repeated over and over throughout. As if being one of the 98% of the population who are normal, average, ""ordinary"" people is like having a disgusting disease. Unless you have some sort of talent or individuality (which of course, none of these characters do) you're destined to remain ""ordinary"", but there's nothing wrong with that. <br/><br/>It tries to be realistic, but ends up being the opposite, yes it's portraying suburban life, but the way these characters carry themsleves is incredibly cliched and anything but realistic. First, let's take Ricky Fitts. There's no way that a boy who'd been locked up in a mental institution for 18 months (which is unrealistic again, because they don't just take anyone with a behavioral problem, you have to have a legitimate mental illness -which he didn't) and with such a ruthless, cold, dominating father would grow up so stable and confident. In reality he would be at least shy, withdrawn and introverted. And as for him being a drug dealer? Now that's stretching it too far. Addict is more like it.<br/><br/>It's also very irresponsible in that it's unnecessarily misleading. Jane: ""I wish someone would just put him out of his misery"" Ricky: ""would you like me to kill him for you?"" we know they're not serious, but they talk about it as if it was no big deal, as if there were no consequences. And Ricky being such a suave drug dealer, would he be so stupid as to risk getting 20 years to life if he got caught dealing? And again, at the end when 'Colonel' Frank kills Lester, why? just because he embarassed himself in front of Lester? So? Is that reason enough to kill? In real life, no. But in movies, yes. Perhaps this is why American kids are so trigger and drug happy, because on TV/in movies, they're shown that it's cool, there's nothing wrong with it (murder) and that there are no consequences.<br/><br/>That's why American Beauty and movies like it disgust me. It's trying too hard to be cool, and ends up being foolish propaganda. Maybe I'm being too harsh, but I seriously dislike this movie."

","How this film was even nominated for any Oscars much less actually won them is beyond me.  Well, no it isn't.  Kevin Spacey is a brilliant actor.  His body of work speaks for itself.  They could put him in a two-hour, big-screen adaptation of the lamest 70s sitcom and it would be great.  He's like Anthony Hopkins and many others who have saved mediocre and even awful films from oblivion by the sheer force of their presence and their ability to create involving characters from nothing.  The showing of AB at the Oscars shows yet again that the Academy and the rest of America have little in common.<br/><br/>The main problem with this film is that it is one giant cliche - and not even a very original or entertaining one.  The Academy has developed this huge soft spot for films that pander to certain sacred cattle and this is certainly one of them.  Saving Private Ryan was another.<br/><br/>I left this film with the stark realization that I hadn't seen anything in it that was done better in ""The Ref"".  In fact, Spacey played pretty much the same character in both and the basic premise was almost too similar.<br/><br/>The film had its directorial moments but it was clearly a first attempt by a director who shows a great deal of promise but still has a long way to go. Apart from Spacey's character, the rest of the cast were dreary cardboard figures - the shrewish, philandering wife, the troubled teenage daughter, the self-absorbed bad-boy love interest, the right-wing, homophobic neighbor, the corrupt and immoral business associates...  give me a break. <br/><br/>
Bottom line:  Mr. Spacey deserved better, the audience deserved better and the Academy should have known better."

The biggest surprises in the film. besides the amazing dexterity of Sam Mendes at his first outing behind the camera, are West Bentley. Chris Cooper, Thora Brch and Allison Janney. As I'm writing this 8 years after its first release, the Oscars and the whole hullabaloo, I'm very surprised that West Bentley hasn't become a major star.

When I first watched the movie, I was thinking that human beings are too keen to pretend to be ill.

","The meaning of beauty differs from perspective to perspective. Some people may find beauty in simple things which is without any desires or wishes and some may find beauty in material things filled with lust and hunger. Sam Mendes in this masterpiece tries to tell us that the meaning of beauty in this modern world is not letting your life waste and living it upto its fullest. The movie revolves around the daily problems of an ordinary middle class man named Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) who is trying to find happiness and balance in his life. He is having a hard time in his marriage with Carolyn (Annette Bening). Their daughter Jane (Thora Birch) despises and hates them for interfering in her life often. Amidst this, Lester develops an infatuation for Jane's cheerleader friend Angela (Mena Suvari) and starts having sexual fantasies about her. I was amazed by how delicately Sam Mendes puts forth the idea of beauty and combines this with the American dream. Kevin Spacey delivers a mind blowing performance. No wonder this movie bagged five academy awards including best picture, director and actor in a lead role. This movie is a definite watch for those who want to introspect deep into their lifestyles along with some good drama and fabulous acting."

","This is a good-looking movie, why do you say that? When I watched it, I didn't pay too much attention to the progress bar, and when I reacted, the film had reached the end. It is very rare for a film to be immersed in it. ""American Beauty"" is quite natural and fascinating. After watching it, it can't help but wonder. It is no wonder that it will win five Oscars and 2000 Oscar Awards. 3 nominations.<br/><br/>This movie mainly describes 7 characters and 2 American families. Perhaps many people hate the male type of Leicester, but my favorite character is him. He is indeed ""dirty"" at the beginning of the film. He was obsessed with his daughter's girlfriends, and was in a dire situation. He faced resignation, became hot and cold with his wife, and became estranged from his daughter. However, after realizing that his daughter's girlfriend Angela was not disgusted with himself and wishing to keep fit, he became quite active after he met the new neighbor, the drug dealer Richie, who was a classmate with her daughter, and started taking drugs. Came alive from a pool of stagnant water.<br/><br/>Although the motivation and reason are not pure, the optimism, cheerfulness, and positiveness of the male lead Leicester have infected me. In the movie, there have been two changes in the male lead. The first time is his obsession with Angela and drug addiction. This change has transformed him from a middle-aged man with a middle-aged crisis, unemployment crisis, and family crisis into a new confidence in life. , Gradually recovering the family who actively pursued love, but at this time he was still quite selfish and morally misplaced; the second change was when he had Angela at his hand and worked hard to get it back, he found that Angela was At the time of his virginity, he felt a sense of protection for Angela and suppressed his desires. He regained morality, cared for his daughter, and the responsibility of a father and husband. His inner integrity became straight.<br/><br/>The transformation of the male host is complete, and the film seems to usher in a relatively good ending, ""The male host picks up the goodness of life, improves family relations, finds a job, etc."", but a gunshot sounds and the male host suddenly dies and paints the film. It came to a not-so-complete but perfect period. To quote Leicester, ""I guess I should be angry when I die, but the world is so beautiful, I should not be angry all the time."" This is the charm of Leicester in the film, calm and optimistic, always with a smile. Compared with the other six characters, I found that perhaps the person who was the most abnormal at the beginning was the most normal at the end.<br/><br/>The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Photography and Best Film Editing, and the reasons can be glimpsed from many of the lenses. The performance of the two discordant families in the film is described by a three-person long lens. The Leicester family eats at the dining table. Leicester, his wife, and her daughter sit upright, and the ritual is full, but The distance between the triple rooms is very far. As the camera zooms in, the distance gets farther and farther. Although the three people have a dialogue, but there is no lens conversion, this kind of unharmonious expression is most vividly expressed.<br/><br/>Neighbor's house, a family sitting on the sofa watching TV, a very small sofa, there should be a half position between the two, the same three-person lens, the same sense of alienation, no need to describe too much, the internal relationship between the two families The tension was conveyed to the audience.<br/><br/>A lot of symmetrical picture composition is used in the film to make it grand and magnificent, but also give people the visual enjoyment and beauty. The 2.55: 1 aspect ratio is easier to see if it is a symmetrical structure. The house, the movements of the characters, and the symmetry have always appeared. I was impressed by a scene. Leicester came to the daughter 's room to secretly call Angela. The daughter came out of the bathroom. The male owner slipped away from the door. The two doors were in the middle. One is on the right, what to do with asymmetry? The director installed a mirror on the left, symmetrical the door on the right to the left, and created a symmetrical composition.<br/><br/>The use of Richie's camera in the film is unique. I can see these two points. The first point is to use a camera to show Ricky 's love for her daughter Jenny. There is no way to say that Ricky likes Jenny in the film, but the audience is convinced. why? Because many times in the film, Richie was shooting Jenny with a camera, constantly zooming in, and putting Jenny 's face to the maximum. Even though Angela was doing various provocative movements, Richie 's lens was ""invisible"". The second is that when Jane and Rich talked about hiring Leicester, the camera's implementation of the imagery showed the expressions of the two people facing the same picture, using a lot of picture-in-picture and even making the picture-in-picture symmetrical. Of course, there are more than these. When Rich's father stormed Rich at home, the camera also played a role, so I will not list them here.<br/><br/>Before the end of the film, the dialogue between the male lead Leicester and Angela in the living room was the climax of the movie's soaring acting skills. This was the second change of the male lead and his sublimation moment, a 20-second shot, It is all interpreted by the male facial expressions, ""I'm fine,"" said the male host's sadness, and awakened his love for home.<br/><br/>After the male host was shot, many cross montages were used to explain that the male host 's wife wanted to kill the male host, so the audience had the illusion that the male host 's wife killed the male host, but the male host was clearly affectionate when he was killed. Looking at his family photo, how can his wife get it? I was puzzled. Sure enough, with the monologue of the male lead, a group of pictures with the same scene and the same direction of movement were superimposed by crossing the empty mirror with the reality. Three shots were fired. Six other characters were in the event. The last shot revealed that the murderer was a neighbor-the father of Rich.<br/><br/>It is beautiful to live, just like a plastic bag fluttering in the wind, trying to live as much as possible. This movie makes me feel a lot. It seems to be just telling a story and reflecting a reality, but it contains something else. Leicester: ""You must not know what I am talking about, don't worry, you will understand one day.""<br/><br/>However, this movie reminds us that if there is a misunderstanding, we must clarify it as soon as possible, or do not lie, because it may even cause the death of a life, let relatives go to prison, and the family broken."

""For what happened to me, I can be angry, but the world is so beautiful, it's hard to stay angry, sometimes I feel like I encounter too many beautiful things at a time, almost can not stand, my heart is like a balloon inflation, is about to blast, and then I remember to relax, do not grasp not to put, so it just like the rain washed away, and I have no feeling, only grateful, grateful for every moment of my stupid life, I'm sure you don't understand what I'm talking about, but don't worry, someday you will understand.""<br/><br/>I also don't understand, many things originally need time to fill, life is too much out of control, for life, you, I, are not a bystander, but that only by the wind is disorderly blowing by people with eye shit stare at the plastic bag."

","Despite all the plaudits - including 5 Oscars, 6 BAFTAs and 3 Golden Globes - I didn't love this film. It focuses on the trials and tribulations of ostensibly happy, humdrum daily life with all of the idiosyncrasies engendered by the bored, frustrated and jealous people whose lives are pretty empty of meaningful experiences from day to day. I struggled from the outset to see why anyone would be besotted with the rather skeletal ""Angela"" (Mena Suvari); perhaps that is what makes Kevin Spacey's performance so appreciable as the pretty unlikeable voyeur (""Lester""). Are we supposed to like him; sympathise with him, hate him - all of those? I didn't know - and I don't suppose that I really bothered much either. His self-induced mid-life crisis was rather tedious as a storyline, regardless of the actor's (superb) quality of character delivery. Clearly Sam Mendes had a vision for this - but like life itself, it is all over the place. By the time we get to the repressed gay aspects of ""Lester"" and the shame/depression and brutality that it appears to evoke from his thoroughly flawed personality I needed to come up for air... Without a doubt it is a well constructed piece of cinema, but the underlying complexities are so convoluted as to render it little more than an over-long sad indictment of American suburban existence where all human life appears to exist within one single street..."

"shelle-68863","6","0","0","13 December 2019"," Interesting look at American families
","American Beauty revolves around a middle-aged father, Lester Bernham (Kevin Spacey). Lester is unhappy with his current state in life, and seems to kind of snap and change abruptly. We follow Lester as he delves into a laze fare lifestyle in which he becomes attracted to a girl the same age as his daughter. Other plotlines branch out with Lester's wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and daughter Jane (Thora Birch). Each separate story brings to light a different cultural issue in our society. We see infidelity in the affair Carolyn has, and typical teenage drama with Jane. The big surprise and difference in this film is Lester's undying attraction to his daughter's friend Angela (Mena Suvari). As Lester becomes more and more laid-back, he begins to make bad decisions, and almost sleeps with this young girl. In an even more surprising twist of irony, the man who started to fall apart seems to wake up and do the right thing in the end.
The theme of American Beauty is family. Specifically, the unconditional love for family. We see different examples of this theme throughout the film. Two main families appear in American Beauty. The Brenham's, who seem to go through a power struggle, and the Fitts's whose structure is clear and rigid. In the following paragraphs, I will go over some examples of why I believe the film to be family.
My first example deals with the main character of the movie, Lester. Lester feels powerless in his life. Lester's wife, Carolyn, is distant and does not show any affection. His daughter views him as a creepy old man, which is not entirely incorrect. His job is looking to let people go because of indiscretions from upper management. Everything in his life seems to be against Lester, and he can't handle it. Lester begins to make poor decisions, and he stops caring about his family. Lester lusts after an underaged girl and drives his family away. Lester starts to smoke marijuana, which he gets from his neighbor Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley). Throughout the entire movie, we see Lester make decision after decision that implies, he doesn't care about his marriage or his family. This behavior goes on until just before his murder. Lester picks up a picture of his family and seems to snap out of his mid-life crisis. He realizes, just before his death, that he loves and cares for his family.
Carolyn is no saint in the movie. She has an affair with a real-estate rival. She is cold and distant from Lester, and she makes snide comments to her daughter. It seems that Carolyn, similar to Lester, is pushing her family away. This behavior continues up to the point where she is about to murder Lester herself. We see Carolyn listening to a self-help book and holding a pistol. A bright red door is all that stands between Carolyn and Lester on a dark and rainy night. We see Lester's murder and assume Carolyn killed her husband. It isn't until we see Carolyn sobbing and grasping at Lester's hanging clothes in his closet that we realize she still loves Lester. Throughout the film, we see no indication that Carolyn cares about her family, but like Lester, at the very end, it is clear that she does.
Jane goes through a similar transformation as her mother. Jane makes repeated comments about how creepy and disgusting her father is. She mentions that she can't bring a friend home without her father being weird. Lester and Carolyn push Jane away to the point where she is willing to run away with her boyfriend, Ricky. Just before they leave, they hear the gunshot that kills Lester. When Jane sees her father, she is understandably distraught.
The other family in the movie, the Fitts's, has a much different dynamic. Colonel Fitts, Ricky's father, is the ultimate power in their household. When Ricky disobeys or makes a mistake, it is met with physical violence, as opposed to the Brenham's, who primarily use passive-aggressive comments and behaviors. The Fitts's provide an excellent example of family as a theme of American Beauty. Ricky and his father do not see eye to eye. After a misunderstanding involving Ricky and Lester, Colonel Fitts kicks his son out of the house. Colonel Fitts then visits Lester soaking wet and crying. This sturdy military man is brought to tears by his love for his son, and his inability to accept Ricky. Though Ricky's father is the reason his son left, he still loves his son and blames Lester. This love for his son drives Colonel Fitts to murder Lester over a misunderstanding.
Oddly, this movie reminded me of an extremely dark version of Office Space. As far as my theme goes, the movie Click comes to mind. In both of these movies, we see a husband who has a good life but wants more. The pursuit of these desires is the undoing of both Lester and Michael Newman (Adam Sandler). In both cases, if these main characters would appreciate what they have, and work on solving problems, they would have ended up in a better place.
Many cinematic techniques go into supporting the theme of family in American Beauty. One notable example is the use of color. The color red is vital to the theme of this movie. It appears that as Lester falls into his mid-life crisis, that the color red symbolizes his deepest desires. From the very beginning, we see a flood of bright red roses as Lester imagines Angela naked. Later in the film, Lester buys a bright red car that he has always wanted. When Angela approaches Lester the night of his death, she is wearing bright red lipstick, and a bouquet of bright red roses is in the shot. This color repeatedly appears up the point of Lester's death and beyond with the bright red pool of blood contrasting the white table. Carolyn also appears in a red dress and red nails after Lester resists Angela. This use of color could be a sign that Carolyn is something that Lester desires. The red door may be a reference that he wants his family back, and he wants a peaceful home. Interestingly, color vanishes as he remembers the good times with his family. Lester holds their family photo and flashes back to happy times. The absence of color here can help to create a feeling of old memories. I think the use of black and white in this scene, in particular, is to contrast his fake desires from his real desires. While he is going through his mid-life crisis, this bright red color is tantalizing and represents his selfish desires. The black and white scenes show what really matters to him after he finds clarity just before his death. (Petrie and Boggs, 2018, p. 202-204).
Another technique that supports family as a theme is camera angles. We see two very different families throughout this film. When Lester and his family are on screen, most of the camera shots tend to stay very neutral. This angle is evidence of the power struggle in the Bernham family I mentioned earlier. From time to time, the camera angle changes to suggest more power from Lester, and other times Carolyn seems to be the alpha. The point here is that there is no dominant force in the Bernham family.
In contrast, the Fitts's have no question who is in charge. We see Ricky looking up at his father many times throughout the movie. This angle represents the dominance that Colonel Fitts has over his family. In more extreme cases, such as when Ricky gets hit by his father, the camera angle keeps Colonel Fitts way above Ricky. These different camera angles support the theme of family because it helps to create a sense of each family dynamic. This view of each family helps to make sense of the film, and illustrate the differences between the families. (Petrie and Boggs, 2018, p. 131-132).
American Beauty brings a lot of social issues to light. Many themes could be analyzed throughout the movie. I chose to pursue the theme of family. I decided on this theme because I think that the dynamic between the two main families is interesting. Also, the fact that after everything the characters go through, in the end, family is what matters to them."

","The movie revolves around a 40 something man (named: Lester Burnham = Kevin Spacey) who is dominated by his real estate agent wife and is lost when interacting with his teenage daughter (Jane Burnham played by Thora Birch). The funny thing is: he does not think he is lost, but he feels that his daughter and his wife both consider him worthless. He hates his job: yearns for self-worth even at workplace. To sum it up, the character starts deeply unsatisfied, sad and disillusioned about his life.<br/><br/>His wife (Carolyn Burnham: Annette Bening): a 40 something real estate agent is shown to be this 'act' cool wife who struggles to sell homes and tries to motivate herself - screaming, talking to herself, pepping up her early mornings with motivational chants etc. She is someone who believes she has seen troubled times, has understood struggle and accumulated as she struggled.<br/><br/>They have a nice house, they have the luxury and everything else which you associate with a happy household. But things are up to the mark. This is where the movie adds up layers while explaining their character traits even more.<br/><br/>****** spoiler follows:
Frank goes to his daughter's cheerleading sessions during one of the games, apparently disinterested. He persists with it on his wife's insistence. She reminds him of his growing disconnect with his daughter. And he agrees, but seems to be not in the mood to care or address the issue - he still hangs around.<br/><br/>When he gets bedazzled by this young, blonde cheerleader friend of his daughter. What follows is a reaction in which he yearns for contact, reimagines sex and gets excited to masturbate thinking about her, while his wife is sleeping next door.<br/><br/>This friend Angela (played by Mena Suvrai) also has an interesting philosophy - life is all about exploring and soaking all the attention. She appears to be comfortable with people admiring and wanting her, people even thinking about her and engaging with themselves. So she clearly appears strong headed and tells Jane (daughter : Thora Birch), that she would love to get attention even from her dad, who she thinks is interesting. Why, despite appearing under confident, does she engage with Jane's dad? Is she exploratory? or is she seeking adventure.<br/><br/>Intertwined with Angela and Jane is another peeing tom, their new neighbor (Ricky Fitts: played by Wes Bentley) who goes to the same high school, has a retired military father who is strict Christian Texan - in that order. Now, Ricky's life is from his video camera which he uses to capture his world. He follows Jane and captures her from her bedroom window. He keeps recording and when confronted does not get awkward or does not hide his activities.<br/><br/>His matter of factly response to situations catches Jane's attention. She admires his confidence. She admires the fact that he is outright confident and does not feel the need to defend his actions, when confronted. She admires him also because she is not confident about her own actions, which makes her stay and draw upon the more confident Angela. After her interactions with Ricky, she starts getting interested in him.<br/><br/>Stories move on and characters keep developing layers. The climax is an interaction of these characters which is not critical to the beauty of the movie. It is interesting but does not drive the Oscar."

In addition, the characterization of its characters within what is understood as a dysfunctional American family is very good. It's a good movie, it teaches us that not always what we want is what really makes us happy, that there are many feelings behind appearances and that if we don't take control of our lives we can end up in a big void.

","I loved how this small situation stood as an accurate, well developed metaphor for themes behind the ideals of suburban living as well as what tends to get in the way of these ideals or whether we genuinely believe in them or not. I also loved how quickly all these ideals sort of crashed into each other and unraveled, but it never once seemed an impossible course of action for any of the characters considering where they lived.<br/><br/>Totally makes you think about the American dream and its' relevance under the strain of mediocrity that suburban living presents, dulling the excitement and motivation, but not dulling flat desire. And it's so fascinating to watch the characters attempt to achieve desire and motivation, yet fail to change things much externally. Because that is one of the most major themes of suburban living. Comfort in living in a box taking priority over living with motivation. I think.<br/><br/>Or rather the struggle between the desire to live comfortably but in perpetual boredom, and the desire to live doing what you want and saying what you feel but being unstable.<br/><br/>There is so much of that in suburban living, like the concept of a midlife crisis, where the mediocrity of suburban living makes someone go on a desperate journey to fill their life with excitement and motivation. Ultimately, however, they tend to come back from this high or are largely expected to come back down from this high from their friends and family. Because comfort even in a box, takes priority over living with motivation. That's why this movie is fascinating. It explores the internal pain and struggle behind mediocre lives and relationships, allowing us to study what brings us together under these conditions and what drives us apart."

","I confess I expected more from this movie. Considered one of the 100 best films ever by more than one list written by more than one authority on the subject, he has won five Academy Awards from the Hollywood Academy (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Photography) and three Globes of Gold (Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay). It's an enviable record for a movie that, when we look at it, doesn't seem to justify it ... In fact, just looking at the Oscar nominees for Best Movie in that far 2000s, I liked ""The Insider"" or ""a lot more"" The Green Mile ""than this movie, which basically portrays the unfulfilled fantasies of a middle-aged, suburban middle-class man when<br/><br/>In fact, the American middle class is portrayed here in an almost dystopian way: a social group wrapped in huge paranoia about appearances and ""looking good,"" obsessed with politically correct and socially acceptable, trying to keep secrets, taboos, prejudices and imperfections hidden through a beautiful house, a spotless lawn, a new car, a good tie. The patriarch of the family lives a crisis of middle age through the nostalgia of past and underused youth, to the point of feeling a sudden sexual attraction for a teenager. His wife, in turn, is the archetype of frivolity and emptiness, living a marriage of appearances and discounting everything through an extramarital affair. The daughter of this dysfunctional couple is the typical young rebel ... until she decides to plot with her boyfriend to kill her own father. And there is much more throughout the movie. Cartoon characters in a dystopian and uncomfortable portrait, especially for those who identify with the US suburban middle class (not my case at all).<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening and Thora Birch are the central trio of actors who bring life to a family that is beyond normal. Nevertheless, the three had excellent performances and in fact deserved to be awarded and recognized for that. Mena Suvari also looked good to me as the provocative nymphet. Sam Mendes ensured careful, bold and inspired driving. Having been the first film in which he participated as a director, it was certainly a milestone in his career and secured a future for him.<br/><br/>Provocative, bold, disturbing, is a movie where taboos are put in check and troublesome truths are exposed. It is not at all a family movie or to see with children and young people nearby."
"JMichaelAtchue","8","0","0","7 September 2019"," A Solid 90's Drama
","""American Beauty"" is a solid 1990's drama with strong performances, creative visuals, and poignant themes. Twenty years later it still holds up as an entertaining story about a dysfunctional family and discontent in the American suburbs. After multiple viewings I find that I most enjoy the movie's ironic sense of humor - which comes out strongest in Kevin Spacey's turn as Lester Durnham. (Although watching the movie after the 2017 sexual harassment allegations against him makes for an uncomfortable experience).<br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie also suffers from poor dialogue and a muddled message. Lines like ""what a lame-o"" or ""Mr. Smarty-man"" are common in a script filled with similarly awkward turns of phrase from the central cast. (However Lester's dialogue is consistently well-written). The overall film is a broad critique of 1990s America, striking at materialism, homophobia, and gun culture. While ""American Beauty"" provides some fascinating insights into these themes the movie doesn't clearly communicate how they all tie together, and in the case of materialism the movie doesn't show why it's so bad. Is materialism bad because it ruined Lester's marriage? Or because it's intrinsically wrong?<br/><br/>Either way, the film's handling of this theme is problematic: all the main characters are well-off white people in the most powerful and prosperous country in world history. Should we really be concerned that Carolyn overvalues the price of a couch? Is that honestly such a horrible thing to do in the grand scheme of things? When the Burnhams, particularly Lester, complain about their lives they often come off as whiny and entitled - ignorant of the immense privileges they enjoy over millions of other people in America who lack a fancy house or an expensive car. In contrast Ricky Fitts is by far the most sympathetic character in the film because, unlike the Burnham family, he endures a lifetime of genuine abuse and humiliation at the hands of his father. The film would've done better to focus on their relationship instead of the comparatively less interesting Burnhams.<br/><br/>That being said, the movie has a brilliant ending that totally subverts your expectations in a shocking but completely memorable way. I won't go into detail here, but it absolutely needs to be seen. Was ""American Beauty"" the best movie of 1999? Despite winning Best Picture the film isn't as good as ""Magnolia"" or even ""Fight Club,"" which addressed the same themes to a more lasting effect. In fact because it satirizes instead of celebrates people like Lester Burnham, ""Fight Club"" is more perceptive and even more relevant. But all the same ""American Beauty"" is a compelling drama that's well worth two hours of your time. 8/10."

","Everyone talks about the film aspects that make American Beauty such a praised movie. Analysis videos mention how Red symbolizes love and lust or how the blood means the opposite. Roses mean lust and-simply-desire.<br/><br/>American Beauty, which won Best Picture for 1999, moves me in a different way. I am 20 years old now, and I first saw it when I was 17. I liked it when I first saw it, and that was about it. I thought of the plot later, realizing that the movie focuses on a 42 year old man in his mid-life crisis wanting to seduce his daughter's 17 year old friend.<br/><br/>I got rid of my old copy after that, but then a year later my Marketing teacher gave me a box of DVDs that his wife and him didn't want. American Beauty happened to be one of them. It's the copy I still own today, in fact.<br/><br/>This may sound like a terrible idea, but I wanted a 2nd opinion on the movie, so I asked my Grandma to see it with me.(I was 18 at this point). As I watched it again, and noticed this time that Lester(the 42 year old) tries to resist his temptation, and when he gets his chance, he stops himself. (That's how far I will go to avoid spoilers.)<br/><br/>I asked my Grandma about what she thought of the movie. She said it was okay. So then I asked ""So...what did you think of the Dad and the teenager?"" She responded with: ""Well, sometimes that happens."" From there she explained that it is not okay but we do live in a world where such things happen.<br/><br/>I responded with: Well, if I have a mid-life crisis, I'm not going to do that!"" I found myself dwelling on that discussion often, and I thought about ways Lester could have dealt with his immoral desire. And that slowly made it one of my favorite movies.<br/><br/>Forget the Oscars and the film-making aspects, American Beauty truly is a beautiful movie due to it's message of sexual purity in a parable, for lack of a better term, of what happens if you are NOT sexually pure.<br/><br/>It may make you uncomfortable, but it should. It's wrong to chase after such desires, and seeing the downfall of such behaviors will in the end make you a better person from having learned from it.<br/><br/>The tagline for American Beauty is ""Look closer."" If you do that, you will find a fascinating and thought provoking look at sex and marriage. That's what makes it a great movie...to me."

In doing so he starts to enjoy things more often and even pursue his daughters friend. The movie's well shot, well acted and well written. It's a critique on what suburban life really is like vs how it's marketed. The beginning scene shows Lester behind his desk in front of a computer with the screen showing what resemble bars from a jail cell. The other actors are pretty good: Annette Bening plays Lester's neurotic wife Carolyn Burnham who's also a real estate broker, Wes Bentley plays the enigmatic artist who likes to film things with his camcorder who's also a small-time weed seller.<br/><br/>The music's great as well. It's a combination of classic songs and original compositions. I really like Elliot Smith's cover of the Beatles Because. It's really nice to hear.

","1999 was a really good year for filmmaking. Many amazing hit movies were released that year, The Sixth Sense, The Matrix, Toy Story 2. Some movies released that year, people didn't like too much, but now it has a cult following, Fight club (one of my all time favorites), Eyes Wide Shut, The Mummy. And, there are movies released that year that many might say overrated, The Blair Witch Project, and the movie I'll be talking about today, American Beauty. This movie won best picture at the 2000 academy awards, and I found that out before watching the film. Throughout watching American Beauty, I kept wondering to myself, HOW DID THIS MOVIE GET BEST PICTURE WTFFFF. Well, I guess the academy awards in 2000 just thought that a movie like American Beauty is outstanding. As you can tell, I'm not a particularly huge fan of this movie. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, because it's not, but I don't think this movie is a masterpiece as some people have said. Let's start off with my biggest issue with the movie, the mood and tone of the movie just didn't sit right with the plot. The plot is considered creepy and weird, but the movie is a drama-comedy. Weird and drama-comedy don't mesh together very well, as presented in this movie. It's like trying to get 2 of the same poles on 2 magnets to attract to each other, IT DOESN'T WORK. I also didn't like a lot of Kevin Spacey's narration in this movie. It kind of spoils things that happens later in the movie, and I didn't like that. This isn't a con, but the scene where Ricky Fitts shows Lester's daughter the video of the flying bag was so unintentionally funny. The first time I watched the movie with my cousin, we laughed our asses off so hard. It was superbly unintentionally funny, I loved it. I'm glad that scene exists because it's so funny and memorable. Now, let's get into the pros of this movie. I'm really glad that this movie won best original screenplay at the academy, because the screenplay is really damn good. The information we need to know in this movie is presented so creatively, it blows my mind. If you watched the first Lessons On The Screenplay video on this movie, it goes over the creative methods used in the screenplay, and it is really nuts what Alan Ball did with this screenplay. The first dinner table scene in this movie is so memorable not just because it was intense, but because we learned just enough about these characters in a few exchanges of dialogue. The acting was phenomenal, especially Kevin Spacey's performance. I also like how the movie doesn't answer its questions that are brought up, because we the audience can have our own interpretation about what happens next. I think this is a really well made film. If the movie just got its tone and mood aligned with the plot, it could've been way better. 8/10"

","Career best performances from Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening. ""American Beauty"" is a comedy because we laugh at the absurdity of the hero's problems. And a tragedy because we can identify with his failure. The movie is about a man who fears growing older, losing the hope of true love and not being respected by those who know him best. The movie is the story of his rebellion. It's more about sadness and loneliness than about cruelty or inhumanity. Nobody is really bad in this movie, just shaped by society in such a way they can't be themselves, or feel joy. Thora Birch and Wes Bentley are the most grounded, talking in the tense, flat voices of kids who can't wait to escape their homes. Bening's character, a real estate agent who chants self-help mantras, confuses happiness with success--bad enough if you're successful, depressing if you're not. And Spacey, an actor who embodies intelligence in his eyes and voice, is the right choice for Lester Burnham. He does reckless and foolish things in this movie, but he doesn't deceive himself; he knows he's running wild--and chooses to, burning up the future years of an empty lifetime for a few flashes of freedom. He may have lost everything by the end of the film, but he's no longer a loser."

","1999 was the year of cinema in the US of A. I don't think I have ever had seen as many movies in terms of quantity, but also in terms of quality. It was the year of the Green Mile which I still don't like, but many cinephiles would argue otherwise. It's also the year of ""The Sixth Sense"" the outsider that year and the popular choice.
In that year, the Academy chose American Beauty. They should have picked M Night Shyamalan's movie instead.
Don't get me wrong, I love American Beauty, and still think it's a masterpiece, but I don't like the message it conveys and the agenda it tries so hard to push. 
The performances are all top notch. Whether you like him or not amidst the Me Too movement and its ramifications, he delivered what some still argue as the performance of his career. Again, the cast is top notch and my favorite character is Jane, beautifully played by a young Thora Birch. 
The movie tackles issues that are actually non issues if that makes sense. Living in the suburbs can be seen as the epitome of happiness. Not in American Beauty, where the characters are so bored they're looking for things that make them happy, only to end up completely disappointed. I'm not gonna spoil the movie for those who are yet to enjoy it, but for me, the movie is not really worth watching anymore, expect for the performances."

Carolyn is focused primarily on herself and her career while Jane is a typical, rebellious teenager that seems to be lost in the world.

Slightly magical and intriguing charms and allows to dive into the show. The movie presents that life can be like a plastic bag on the wind: unpredictable and surprising at every step. What decides about life being good or bad? Is it the wealth? Happy family? Or maybe living in general? Each of us has a limited lifetime and should make as much as possible within it. Dreams can come true, we just need to push them a little and that the most beautiful things are usually the details. Also the pressure from the community or another person can lead to an absolute madness, people can do and consider things that they would never think of normally. In ,,American Beauty'' there is both love and hate at its finest, and how it affects our lifes. The movie teaches and talks about topics of everyday life, and how it can be given a unique pace, since life and its point are the main features of this masterpiece. 5 Oscars absolutely deserved 10/10!"

"ericstevenson","10","0","0","23 April 2018"," Well, I think it holds up
","It's always great to see a movie that won none other than Best Picture and I think this movie easily deserved it! This movie tells the story of a character played by Kevin Spacey named Lester who falls in love with a friend of his daughter's named Angela. There's an important subplot about a guy named Ricky next door who falls in love with the daughter. He is shown filming everything because he wants to see the beauty in the world. It's best represented when he has a video showing something as simple as a plastic bag drifting in the wind. Ricky's father, Colonel Fitts is an extreme homophobe.<br/><br/>For awhile, it seems like they're avoiding the whole plot about Angela and Lester. What's so great is that they really only make it important at the very end. What is it with Kevin Spacey movies and having the last part of them be the best and most important part? It seems as though Lester is going to sleep with Angela, but thank God he realizes that's immoral! What's great is seeing how Angela makes him decide to change his life and do whatever he wants. I'm glad I understand some pop culture references to this.<br/><br/>The movie ends with Lester being shot. His wife was seen with a handgun in a previous scene, so obviously she did it. It then turns out it was Colonel Fitts who earlier was actually revealed to be gay himself as he almost kissed Lester. Supposedly, he killed him to cover up the fact that was gay himself. The part where Fitts thinks his son his gay is probably the best and most intense part of the movie! The music is amazing and I love how it ends by saying you can still see beauty in everything. ****"

","With some of the best writing, characters, and scenes ever put to film, American Beauty is simply a perfect movie. It has so much substance in it that you could watch it thousands of times and never get bored. Kevin Spacey's performance is heartbreaking, and most importantly, realistic.
Overall it is a brilliant drama that I would highly recommend. 10/10 for me."
"boozerira","6","0","0","20 March 2018"," I began watching this as a joke. I was pleasantly surprised.
","Call me immature, but whenever I was looking through a list of top rated movies and saw one about Kevin Spacey wanting to bang a teenager, my interest was well caught. That is genuinely how I began watching this film, just to see how well it aged considering how Spacey's career has turned out. I have to say though, I'm absolutely shocked at how well this movie turned out and how memorable it was.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey; admittedly; is a very good actor. He absolutely shines it in this role as Lester, by far the star of the show, as Kevin Spacey does do good with sadistic roles. That isn't a joke. I mean, it literally says that on his very own IMDb page, check the Trade Mark section. ""Often plays cold-blooded and sadistic characters,"" last I checked, which was as I write this, it does indeed say that. For the sake of it, I'm going to ignore the controversy, although it has bothered me how not very many, if at all, new reviews I've seen for this movie that don't talk about the issue. I definitely think it's worth mentioning for the context of the film. It's like as time went on more and more inside jokes you could apply to this movie were created, which made it so much more funny. Enough of that, though.<br/><br/>Like I said, the actual movie surprised me. A lot. I like to think of the movies I watch, and how good they are, partially based on how well I remember them after some time, along with their merit. I have to say, I've watched a few other movies after this one, but I still remember it very well. I don't even need to think about it. <br/><br/>That being said, it has its fair share of issues which keeps it being higher than a seven. I know that a lot of the dialogue is supposed to be cringe, but there's a difference between bad dialogue and dialogue that is supposed to be bad. This might be unpopular, but in my opinion, the weakest link in the cast is Wes Bentley playing Ricky Fitts. I know who he is supposed to be as a person, and he looks the part and feels it, but I genuinely don't enjoy the way he delivers lines. It isn't good. <br/><br/>Another issue I had with this movie were a few of the plot points. I don't want to spoil anything for this old movie, but Jesus, Colonel Fitts takes some huge jumps of logic to get to the conclusions he does get to. No normal person would think like that. <br/><br/>I do believe this movie is worth seeing. It doesn't, by any means, contain the most gut wrenching things I've ever watched in a film, but it'll be good for a laugh and a few, ""What am I watching right now,"" moments."

","This film took a long time to win me over. As a collector of movies featuring pretty actresses, I am used to watching flicks that aren't even remotely in the award-winning classes. As for Oscars, I'm more riding on the backs of oxcarts. So, I was kinda bemused by the prospect of an actual real genuine honest-to-goodness Oscar winner. But, you know what? I didn't experience it as anything better than my usual fare. Well, some time after midway I experienced some more character involvement, and, by the time Lester had Angela there in his arms, oh that was a poignant scene, that music ""old man lying by the side of the road, with the lorries going by"" so beautiful, such ambiance, that was a wonderful scene...<br/><br/>...but getting lyrical about a scene that is so deep into the movie while I sat here for a long, long time thinking ""nothing really special""... <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. There's just been a helluva hullabaloo and I expected something stellar.<br/><br/>All I'm saying is that it is quite far from being so perfect as most people enthuse. Even the iconic rose petal scenes aren't as wondrous as I expected them to be after seeing so many magazine pics. For me the very best scene was Mena Suvari's squirrel-cute face, the close-up in the movie in the kitchen scene with the refrigerator, the one that fills the screen. (The one in the trailer is cute too, but not in the movie)<br/><br/>I think most of the positive response simply comes from the main character speaking to the people out there. So it is perhaps not so much the movie itself, but the emotional catharsis it evokes...<br/><br/>That. And Mena Suvari!"

","American Beauty attempts to give us a glimpse into the lives of many American families where the parents stay together just for show and pretend to live a happy life. In reality they are absolutely miserable and their children resent them because they see right through the fakeness. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) thinks being miserable is all life has to offer him until he becomes infatuated with his daughters teenage friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). Lester then sets out on a course to change his life. He starts telling his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) exactly what he thinks with no regard to the consequences, quits his job, and starts smoking pot. The theme of this movie is that everything is not always as it appears. Taking a closer look would reveal that sometimes a perfect happy looking family is actually far from it. Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley) spends all his time taping the Burnham's daughter Jane (Thora Birch). Jane's friend Angela warns that he is a psycho and spent a long time in a mental hospital. Nobody realized that Ricky grew up with such a strict father and was beat frequently as a child. Jane takes the time to get to know the real Ricky and they both realize they have a lot in common between their messed up families. Throughout the entire film we here Angela talking about all the people she has been with and making herself out to be this person that everyone wants. She appears to have such confidence and seems to enjoy putting others down as she builds herself up. In the scene between her and Lester, we finally realize just how insecure Angela is. The truth is she thinks she is exactly what she tells everybody else is the worst way to be, ordinary. Lester does not take advantage of her but assures Angela that she is far from ordinary. The movie ended in a way I was not expecting with Lester being shot in the head and us wondering who did it. Although seeing the blood on Mr. Fits (Chris Cooper) shirt makes us believe he did it even though Lester's wife Carolyn was carrying a gun."

","I'm not one to tout movies, actors, TV shows etc, but this movie just hit all of those personal nerve endings in such an amazingly eloquent way that I was just left stunned. So many friends and acquaintances of mine thought this movie was depressing and I was so perplexed by that reaction because I think it's incredibly uplifting. This man finally LIVED. How many of us get caught in that vortex of everyday life we think we need to suffer through, but he somehow broke free of that. Sure, it led to perhaps an early death, but he finally LIVED! Brilliant cast, brilliant writing, brilliant music -- to me, a true inspiration. ""Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world, that my heart just wants to cave in."" So often we forget to live life for ourselves, and even when we can't have everything we want, forget to appreciate the beauty around us.

","Lester Burnham, played by Kevin Spacey, is a father and husband in his late 30's to early 40's. He has the perfect wife, child, house, and car living in Suburbia, USA; or so it appears. His wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), is overly obsessed with her job, success, and money, and his daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), is the typical teenage girl going through changes that she does not particularly like. The film begins with voice-over narration from Lester, who is dead. Lester seems to have everything anyone could need, but a closer look reveals the problems that are hidden under the ""picture perfect"" life he appears to have. Lester is missing something he cannot figure out and is more and more unhappy with the passing days. Then, one night, unwillingly, he goes to a basketball game to watch his daughter perform a dance at halftime and gets lost in her friend, Angela (Mena Suvari), who he becomes obsessed with. Once meeting her, he seems to find a lost spark and lets loose into his midlife crisis.<br/><br/>I believe the main theme to this film is obsession and passion. We may think a person's passion is an obsession and vice versa. This is apparent throughout the film in different characters. Lester becomes obsessed with Angela; so much so, anything she says he does. For example when she is telling Jane if he worked out he would be hot. So, Lester begins to work out, smoke pot, and let his inner teenager come out to impress Angela."

"nicoledeweese","10","0","0","24 October 2010"," a family who were dealing with issues in their lives and how those issues affected the other family members.
","My film choice was the movie American Beauty, which was about a family who were dealing with issues in their lives and how those issues affected the other family members. The father Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham is working at a job he hates, his wife Annette Bening as Carolyn Burnham and his daughter Thora Birch as Jane Burnham don't really seem to like him and he is becoming depressed, until he starts developing an infatuation with his daughters friend Mena Suvari as Angela Hayes. Theme is the central insight, the one that explains the greatest number of elements in the movie and relates them to each other. The two major themes in American Beauty are the complexity of human relationship and Coming of age/loss of innocence/growing awareness.<br/><br/>The first theme is complexity of human relationships and this can been seen throughout the entire movie. The first example would be Lester, he is working at a job he isn't happy at, and he is unhappy at home but has to put on a show for the outside world. He then starts developing an infatuation with his daughter's friend Angela, he then realizes how unhappy he is and begins to change his life, he quits his job, he starts working out, buys a new car and even starts a habit of smoking weed. The second example of theme can be seen with Carolyn Burnham which is really big on putting on a show of her ""perfect"" life, she is a Realtor and isn't doing so well, she knows her husband and daughter our unhappy, and she starts to have an affair with the King of Reality trying to make her life more fulfilled. The third example of theme can be seen with Jane Burnham, as she is trying to figure out who she is, she starts liking the new neighbor boy Wes Bently as Ricky Fits, who ironically is the dads drug dealer and ultimately the one who gets him killed. The second theme is coming of age/loss of innocence/growing awareness, this can be seen among Angela she comes across as a beautiful girl, who knows a lot about sex yet is a virgin and wants her first time to be with Lester. This can also be seen with Jane and the experiences she is going through with her parents and the fighting amongst them, when she is trying to figure her life out, yet she comes across as the adult in the movie an example of this is when they are all eating dinner and Lester and Carolyn are having an argument and make her sit and become a part of it. Two techniques that were used are reflection, and repetition. The first one can be seen a few times, when Lester is at work and you see his reflection in the computer, another example is when Ricky is taping Jane and catches her reflection in the mirror. The second technique is repetition of the roses which increases the significance and symbolic power of the roses each time they appear. This is the quote which says it all ""Look closely and you can find Beauty in anything - and it changed my life. I rose out of a long, deep depression and started out into the world. Sometimes there is so much Beauty in the world, I can't even stand it, and it feels like my heart is going to burst."" I feel the overall importance of the themes; complexity of human relationships and coming of age/loss of innocence/growing awareness are important to this movie more so because this is everyday life, this is the true story of many homes, not everyone shows it, that is until they reach that breaking point."

So you try closing your eyes to capture and further cherish the images, the music and the overall experience.<br/><br/>I watched the film again to find many many jewels that I've missed. Then I soon found my self watching the film a third time to fathom, absorb, and enjoy the ""dream"" as a whole.<br/><br/>Enjoy the many genius strokes of cinematography by Conrad Hall, chillingly cozy musical impressions by Thomas Newman.. All subtle and well employed by the director. The acting is nothing less than superbly amazing by namely Wes Bently (Rick), also by Chris Cooper (Colonel Frank), Thora Birch (Jane), Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening. Added th that, Allan Ball's clever script & Sam Mendez's artistic direction, earn this film in my opinion a 9/10.<br/><br/>Lester Burnham, a typical suburbia male in his forties (played by Kevin Spacey) dreams on from the start on.. He gives you many reasons to disgust him.. but not for long .. soon you'll find your self understanding and liking him a lot.<br/><br/>His wife (played by Annette Bening) invokes a laugh or two about how silly our suburban life can be, and she manages to maintain your dislike for the irritating persona much longer towards the end. Only then you discover you like her too.<br/><br/>Their teenage daughter Jane (a lovable freak) is so enjoyably genuine and vivid that you'd wish she is your daughter.<br/><br/>There comes the freaky neighbors: Frank, a US Army colonel, who constantly freaking out his son and neighbors. His wife, or what he left of her, is long worn out by him, but still finds love in her heart to inject in their son.<br/><br/>The film gives you every thinkable reason of hating the colonel, but amazingly giving him so much credibility and depth that you, even knowing what he's capable of, start sympathizing with this wreck of a human being towards the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The real admirable role in the film is their son Rick (played by Wes Bently). Although he's so f...d up, he sees a lot of life and love in everything. He earns the love of the girl at school, her father, and, believe me, yours too.<br/><br/>Don't miss this dream of a film.

Spacey, as I expected, is wonderful, ironic, and depressed sometimes and, to watch his turn from dominated husband to a triumphant and happy person is a great experience, I wanted him to send everybody to hell, but the movie showed me that it really didn't matter anymore to him.<br/><br/>The directing in this movie is very successful too, it chooses first person narrative sometimes, and the movie would not have been the same if they haven't done this.<br/><br/>We also have great character studies in it, like Fits (Bentley) and Col.

","American Beauty is the story of a depressed, cynical forty-two year old Lester Burnham (Spacey) living in suburban America, who reaches a midlife crisis. His pathetic, quasi-narcissistic wife Carolyn (Bening), and introverted, angry teenage daughter Jane (Birch) lives turn upside-down when Lester decides to redefine his lifestyle, taking an interest in an array of interests usually limited to those of several decades less than his age, including Jane's friend Angela (Suvari), and his new beauty-obsessive next door neighbor Ricky Fitz, who also happens to be a drug dealer, and appears to be intimately interested in his daughter, Jane. His life unwinds, and spins as several independent plots cross each other, to lead to his eventual death, with every character having a motive, although this is not the main focus of the film. Every character is brimming with life, and individuality, and are all exceptionally represented. Directing, and screenplay are amazing, and the artistic direction is truly original. Definitely a film you must see before you die, especially if you are a suburban American."

","The movie American Beauty is an emotional and quite disturbing film for any audience to view. The story is based on a man that is experiencing some major life crisis that will indeed send him into a major depression. Lester Burnham is living with his wife and daughter that seem to totally disrespect him in more ways than one. Lester And Carolyn seem to have this fantasy life style that his wife Carolyn is obsessed with and will work herself into a frenzy to accomplish what she wants for herself and completely not considering her mate Lester Burnham. Theme<br/><br/>The theme of the movie had a lot of interesting points that makes perfect sense in the real world of adult hood and adolescence. Carolyn had the type of personality that she wanted to interpret that she was financially stable and her career was stable. With all this being said she was putting a significant amount of pressure on her husband to be something that he was not.<br/><br/>Another theme of the movie that with all of the emotional stress in the Burnham's home it caused their daughter to feel emotional stressed as well. The movie had some low points as well as good points. I felt as though Lester should have maybe fantasized about someone his own age or maybe even someone a bit younger; not a child that was just not acceptable.<br/><br/>The name American Beauty can mean so much to a person; in my opinion it means ""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" meaning it is not just the outside of a person, it is there insides as well. The director had various ideas of beauty in my eyesight. The character Ricky was viewing beauty as filming and everything that surrounded him, the smallest things meant a lot to him.<br/><br/>Color/Insight<br/><br/>The color scene for the movie was very dark and made the movie more relevant to its characters. The characters played dark roles; so the director may have thought that if the roles are dark maybe the colors should not be bright. The writer and director wanted colors and the schemes to represent how shallow and depressing the characters was and how the lives were in shambles. <br/><br/>The costumes and makeup designs were followed with great character as well. The look of Carolyn was just as most would think; very business like with a touch of High Class style and perfection. Lester Burnham was very low maintenance and did not need very much to make him happy. His wardrobe consisted of suits when was working for the advertising firm. After Lester was released from the advertising job he then preceded into the attire of jeans and t-shirts, much laid back attire. <br/><br/>The overall concept of the movie was very much disturbing and quite amusing at some points in the film, but my opinion of the film is very modest. I think the writer/director wanted the audience to really see how things are portrayed in the life of average working people and to prove that money can not buy happiness at any means."

","This film is without a doubt a classic. It has won a whopping 88 awards, including, but not limited to five Oscars, one Grammy and 3 Golden Globes. It has been mentioned and spoofed in dozens of other movies, shows, cartoons and whatnot. Some might even consider it a cult film. But does the movie really live up to its reputation?<br/><br/>Let's start with the MAIN CHARACTERS. American Beauty centers around the typical American-dream-family Burnham, living in the suburbs of an unnamed, typical American city. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), the father of the family, is the main character and narrator of this movie. He is a 42 year old advertising agent, moaning about his boring, dull life. His wife Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening) is an unsuccessful realtor, unhappy with her unused potential. And their 16-year-old daughter Jane (Thora Birch) coping with typical teenager problems like being embarrassed about her nerdy parents or uncertainty of life.<br/><br/>As for the PLOT, Lester himself narrates his last days of his life post mortem, claiming he will be dead soon. In the beginning he is a self-proclaimed loser without any joy or excitement in his life. But this is about to change when he meets Janes friend Angela (Mena Suvari) and immediately has the hots for her. After overhearing a conversation between Angela and Jane, where Angela tells Jane her feelings about Lester (""cute, but should work out a little""), he is getting more self confident and starts changing his lifestyle by working out, buying a new car and smoking pot he buys from the boy next door. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Jane builds a relationship with this particular boy named Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley), who is filming her secretly through the bedroom window. Though Ricky is technically a voyeur, Jane starts to like him, because he is so different as he can see beauty in random things. And she happens to like people as different as she is, so these two end up being a couple.<br/><br/>In the meantime Carolyn begins an affair with a business rival, Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) to satisfy her sexual needs. Few scenes later Kane breaks up with her again due to the expensive divorce he would have to pay for.<br/><br/>Eventually, Colonel Frank Fits (Chris Cooper), Rickys father, suspects his son of having a relationship with Lester, because in one of his videos of Jane he captured Lester working out without wearing any clothes. Thinking Lester is homosexual, Frank kisses Lester, who of course rebuffs him, revealing the Colonel himself is homosexual.<br/><br/>After that Lester and Angela finally come together and are about to get it on, when Angela confesses she is still a virgin. Lester doesn't seem to like this and instead wants to have a chat with her now about their personal problems. When Angela leaves for the bathroom, Lester gets shot from behind, while Carolyn is coming home, Jane and Ricky are upstairs in Janes room and Angela was in the bathroom. As it turns out, the Colonel was the one who murdered Lester, because he didn't fulfill the Colonel's homo-erotic desires. <br/><br/>After his death, Lester recaps what happened in his life, coming to the conclusion, that it is hard to be mad, when there is so much beauty in the world.<br/><br/>This covers the plot. But is it a good movie? Well, as bland as the story might look at first glance, it has actually some clever ideas. This movie deals with the problem a man can have in a midlife crisis, the American dream and homophobia, so there might be one or two lessons one could learn. But my problem is the credibility of this movie. There are just some unbelievable and unrealistic scenes that, I think, would never happen in real life. To tell just two of them. I just can't believe Jane falls in love with Ricky. Think about it, he was harassing her by filming her without her permission, day and night. That whole ""there is so much beauty in something."" stuff is just a cheap excuse. And the second problem I have is why do Lester and Angela even come together? I mean, Lester is playing with pedophilia here, and Angela even likes it. It's just weird.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is decent, it has it's illogical moments, but also smart, deep ones. Some might consider it funny, tragic, gross or boring. I think it is okay. And judging by the success the movie had many people have liked it."

","When Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) made me laugh by his little self-introduction at the beginning of ""American Beauty"" I knew: This is a nice film. After having seen the whole movie I realized: It is even great!<br/><br/>What I liked most about this black comedy is its intention: You might think your life is ordinary, boring, not worth living. But you are wrong because there is beauty in it. Every single moment. At the beginning Lester is quite depressed: He has got problems with his family, his job, his whole life. He thinks he must do something crazy to become happy again and at the end he finds out that he is wrong, that his life has been beautiful all the time. <br/><br/>Though you could say that the story sometimes goes a bit over the top when Lester starts smoking pot and falls in love with a young teenage girl (acted out by Mena Suvari) it is one of the movie's best elements.<br/><br/>The other characters and their developments are very well worked-out, too. Carolyn (Annette Bening) thinks that her job as real estate agent is the most important thing in life which is one of the reasons leading to Lester's depressions. She starts an affair and wants to kill Lester at the end but finally realizes that her attitudes towards life are wrong. Jane (Thora Birch) is bored of her life and thinks that it is just ordinary and ugly but finds out about its beauty when meeting Ricky (Wes Bentley) who teaches her a lesson about it. Ricky is also one of the most surprising characters. At the beginning you think that he is just an evil, criminal drug dealer and stalker but then you learn about his true nature: That he is fascinated of life. Here American Beauty teaches us an important lesson: You cannot conclude to the inner qualities of a human just by looking at his outer appearance- another reason why I have been impressed by this movie. Colonel Fits (Chris Cooper) is dominating in his family and tries to hide his homosexuality but finally loses his structure in life.<br/><br/>The camera work of this movie has got a high quality: Sometimes the director is ""playing"" with the camera settings. He shows us the monotony of Lesters neighbourhood by the bird's perspective for example.<br/><br/>There is still one little thing I have to criticise: Sometimes the dialogues and the actors' performance is too static, especially when Ricky is talking to his mother or when the action takes place at school. This is why I did not give 10 points.<br/><br/>But seen as a whole, American Beauty is an impressing movie which makes you laugh at the beginning and think at the end. It is really worth recommending it."

","As many many people might expect according to the heading, my criticism could deal with a popular, successful man called Lester Burnham in his mid-forties, who takes care of his family living in a typical single family house in a residential suburban area in America. But this is not true.<br/><br/>Lester realizes all of a sudden that he is trapped in routine and boredom and thus decides to change that. He quits his job, sells his car to purchase the car he dreamed of as an adolescent. Besides he restarts to smoke pot which he gets hold of from Ricky, his daughter's future boyfriend. Meanwhile he is having erotic daydreams about his daughter's friend Angela. His wife Carolyn cannot voice anything but a good deal of misunderstanding when observing the changes he undergoes. But she changes as well; she is frustrated and starts an affair with a fellow real estate agent which helps her cope with Lester's metamorphosis. So far so good. Mendes succeeds in adding hilarious dialogues supported by well chosen field sizes that make us feel with Lester. Lester modifies his views of life in a way which seems to be childish and immature. But above all he teaches a little lesson in life: to rediscover beauty in trivial things and to be grateful of enjoyable moments in life. This makes him a likable character even though he must pay a high price."

","Where do I begin with such an extraordinary, intelligent and thought provoking piece of art? Lester Burnham is a depressed, middle-aged man, married to a hysterical wife and hated by his teenage daughter. He doesn't see any perspective in his life, hates his job and feels, there is something missing... After meeting his daughters best friend, Angela, he however decides to change all that...<br/><br/>Some wrote, there was nothing special about this plot, but it is the description of any life. There is a reason, why so many love this movie and it is because they want experience something similar to Lester. He tries to break out of his cage and believes to experience real happiness. The genius thing is, that he looks for beauty in revitalizing a long forgotten past, whereas as Ricky teaches us, beauty is to find in every bit of world surrounding us. Lester cannot find beauty and happiness in his past. Angela, the symbol of his past, reveals, that she is an illusion. Yet the past is haunting us (Col. Fits). Lester flees into his past and is punished by an environment, that is not capable in dealing with this. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong about looking in your memories and your past for signs of happiness, that is lacking in your adult life, but we have to find a way of finding this beauty in us and the world around us. Lester is a tragic figure, but he has experienced what it feels like to be free (his personal revolution). He just looked for beauty in the wrong way, it was just an illusion.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite films and it is a joy to watch it again and again. This text represents of course just my own view and I would never claim it to be true. But this is the real beauty of a masterpiece: to get something out of it for yourself and for your life, isn't it? :)"

","I'm usually really careful not to praise a film to the point I make it seem overrated, but it's really hard for me to speak about this film and not simply gush about how great it is.<br/><br/>To me, the defining factor on what makes a great film is whether or not it changes you after viewing it. If you take nothing away from it, then it's not ""great."" Great films change you and make you see the world in a different way than you had before. ""American Beauty"" is one of these films. The message is so honest and true, it really does capture the essence of this confusing, often frustrating, yet ultimately beautiful thing we call life. Some might call it pretentious and simple. I feel sorry for those people for being so cynical that they can't appreciate a message so direct and honest such as this. The main theme of the film is that when you look closer, into anything...life is beautiful.<br/><br/>The family you see on the surface in this movie is like an example of the American dream gone horribly awry. On the the surface, they appear to be nothing but a sad, dysfunctional group of individuals. But, as the tag line says, ""look closer."" This movie teaches you that even underneath the ugliest situations, there is always beauty. Even death is beautiful. Most people spend their entire lives focusing on the bad, but this movie teaches you to step back and take in the wonder and beauty of the world, even in the midst of terrible situations.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is top-notch. The acting is just phenomenal from all parties. The script is never boring, and the last fifteen minutes in particular are amazing. The structure is spot on. The directing balances just the right amount of humor and drama, without making either feel overbearing. The musical score is also poignant and, like everything else in this film, fantastic.<br/><br/>I didn't know whether to be horribly depressed or incredibly uplifted after watching this. My emotions were just swirling inside me. For a movie to impact you on that level is amazing. This movie can change someone's life. I know that's a bold statement, but I feel comfortable in making it."

","To start with, this film is probably my most favorite one, or at least one of it. I first time watched this film when I was 14-15 years old, then I remember, it hadn't had any effect on me.. I thought to myself that this is one ordinary, clichéd film, with no original or outstanding idea... Yet, after couple of years I saw this film again and now I saw it in a totally different way than I did first time. Frankly, I don't even know why.. maybe my comprehension and grasp on films has changed. But now, I realize the true beauty of this movie. It's about typical American family, which at first glance might seem to be perfect as they have everything: beautiful house, both of spouses have well-paid jobs and a teenager daughter. Yet, this family has lots of flaws, love between spouses had faded away long time ago.. Daughter somewhat despises her parents..."
"hall895","8","0","0","11 January 2010"," Look closer indeed
","This film's tagline implores you to ""look closer"". And to truly appreciate the film you must do exactly that. Is anything really as it seems? Is anyone really who they outwardly appear to be? So many characters in the film, and really the story itself, have layers upon layers to them. As the story plays itself out we peel those layers away one by one and eventually we get to the truth and to the heart of who these characters really are. And we see that in many cases the signs were there all along if only we knew to look for them. Look closer.<br/><br/>American Beauty centers around Lester Burnham, a middle-aged man with a job he hates, a wife who ignores him and a 16-year old daughter who thinks he is pretty much the biggest loser to ever walk the earth. Under these circumstances it is not particularly surprising that as we meet him Lester is about to go though a midlife crisis of staggering proportions. Part of the story's genius is that Lester, in his role as the film's narrator, immediately tells us how his story will end. Tucking this bit of information away in the back of your mind gives you an entirely different perspective as you watch the story play itself out. Throughout the story's many twists and turns you can't help but wonder how what you are seeing in any given moment will help lead to the conclusion you know is coming. And when that end comes, inevitable though it may be, it still manages to produce quite the shock in the manner in which it arrives. And then the film is over and you are left to piece it all together in your mind. It's a wonderfully crafted story and the fact that it was a first-time director in Sam Mendes who was able to piece it all together so well is rather astonishing.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey is undeniably brilliant in playing the part of Lester. He makes us feel Lester's frustrations, his longings, and allows us to really enjoy Lester's rare little moments of triumph. When first we see him Lester is so beaten down that it would take something truly amazing to jolt him back to life. Unfortunately for Lester that jolt comes in the rather inappropriate form of his daughter's friend who he lusts after and obsesses over from the moment he first lays eyes on her. Of course this 40-something year old man's obsession with a teenage girl is wildly inappropriate. But it's hard not to sympathize with Lester anyway as his newfound infatuation shakes him out of his rut and allows him to finally start living again.<br/><br/>As Lester's story plays itself out Spacey is ably supported by a wonderful cast all around him. Annette Bening plays his rather cold, career-obsessed wife Carolyn. Carolyn is a woman not immune to the occasional moment of freaking out and at times there's the sense Bening is going a little bit over the top but she's mostly fine. It is three young performers who really shine. Thora Birch plays Lester's daughter Jane and imbues the character with the profound sense of disappointment she feels in her father and in the general state of her life. It's a very mature performance from a very young performer. As Angela, the object of Lester's misguided affections, Mena Suvari has a smaller part to play than Birch but she is very good as well. We know Lester's looking closely at Angela. You should too because there may be plenty hidden under the surface there. And Wes Bentley is a revelation in playing the Burnhams' young neighbor Ricky. After seeing him here one would have expected Bentley to go on to do many great things after this film. That hasn't quite panned out but in this film Bentley gives a wonderfully nuanced, emotional performance. There's one more important role and that belongs to Chris Cooper playing Ricky's father. Here again, look closer. This film is the story of Lester Burnham but there are so many other wonderfully developed characters as well. The film has a fascinating story to tell and that story is crafted rather ingeniously. It's a story you can't help but appreciate and one which you may be turning over in your mind long after the final credits roll. Look closer. And enjoy."
"John_Truby","10","0","0","8 January 2010"," Screen writing as art
","Every once in a while a screenwriter creates an original script that manages to maintain its originality all the way to the screen. Alan Ball's American Beauty is such a script. Though it is not obviously filmic in a ""Star Wars"" kind of way, it is a classic example of the screenwriter's art.<br/><br/>To see how it works, you first have to see how it deviates from the traditional Hollywood movie structure. If there is any one story element that defines the classic Hollywood movie it is a strong desire line. The hero comes up with a goal early in the story and then goes after that goal with great speed and intensity.<br/><br/>But American Beauty cannot use this strategy because it is the story of a man who is purposeless. In other words, his problem through much of the story is precisely that he has no desire line. What's more, his wife, Carolyn, and his teenage daughter, Jane, can't stand him. So instead of a hero with a single, driving story line we have a family where centrifugal force is pulling everyone apart.<br/><br/>The writer, Ball, thus faces some crucial questions: How do you create narrative drive for a character with no desire and a family that is exploding? How do you show the journey the hero takes internally when he is literally going nowhere? How do you take the time to show the forces destroying this family when there is no forward momentum to keep the audience interested? Ball's solution is the storytelling structure. Conventional wisdom looks down on the voice-over in movies as uncinematic. Conventional wisdom has never been more wrong. The storyteller is one of the great film techniques because it allows you to sequence a story by deep structure, not simple chronology.<br/><br/>In American Beauty, the first-person voice-over tells the audience almost immediately that the hero will be dead within a year. This puts a sensational piece of information up front that is also somewhat mysterious.<br/><br/>The writer gains two great benefits from this strategy. First, he tells the audience that big things are going to happen later, so they don't become anxious in the first half of the film while the hero has no desire line. That allows Ball to spend more time detailing the mini-society surrounding the hero and so show the causes of its breakdown.<br/><br/>Second, this information forces the audience to focus on the steps of the hero's journey - both his fall and rise - instead of on what's going to happen at the end. In other words, Ball sacrifices suspense for understanding, texture and depth.<br/><br/>Problem/Need: After the initial voice-over information, Ball uses the first few scenes to depict a man living a suburban nightmare. Not only is Lester hated by his wife and daughter, he has a dead-end job from which he is about to be fired.<br/><br/>Opponent: With the voice-over structure buying him time, Ball has the luxury of detailing the hero's intimate opponents. In a wonderful filmic sequence, wife Carolyn cleans, then shows a house she represents to a number of uninterested buyers. The process ends with her breaking into tears of frustration, then slapping herself to get back on the track to success. This is an opponent with a strong desire of her own, but she is so lost in the hollow optimism and denial of the salesman's life she can only psych herself back up and try again.<br/><br/>Daughter Jane is an opponent who loathes her weak, purposeless father, but she has no purpose of her own, other than to go to school the way she's supposed to.<br/><br/>Desire: In the midst of this family nightmare, Lester gains a desire line that galvanizes him. But it is a desire line he cannot act upon. He falls head-over-heels for dream teen, Angela, his daughter's blond cheerleader friend. Every effort he takes to accomplish his desire - fawning over her, calling her, fantasizing about her - only makes him more pathetic. The inappropriateness of his desire is underlined when we hear Angela speak. She is a walking stereotype who likes when men drool over her because it means she has a chance to become a model.<br/><br/>To kick this story to the next level, Ball introduces another ring of society. Frank, an army colonel who hates gays, and his obedient wife move in next door, along with their weird son Ricky who shoots videos. A gay couple lives across the street and Carolyn is attracted to her idol, real estate king, Buddy King.<br/><br/>Ricky becomes the catalyst for the freedom of both Lester and Jane. He gets Lester high and shows him the liberation that comes from telling your boss to screw off. Through his camera, he literally opens Jane's eyes to the beauty that is all around her, even in the ""dance"" of a grocery bag.<br/><br/>Lester's desire alone cannot drive the story because he cannot act upon it. So Ball extends the story by tracking the desire lines of all the characters in this society. Carolyn wants Buddy, Jane wants Ricky, Ricky wants Jane, Angela wants to be adored by men, and Frank wants to control his son.<br/><br/>These often conflicting desire lines have the ironic effect of both liberating many of these characters and making them hate Lester even more. Lester is still infatuated with Angela, but he is also becoming stronger, challenging his wife and turning the tables on his boss.<br/><br/>This complex of conflicting desires leads to a pivotal scene. Carolyn, feeling great from having sex with Buddy and shooting her pistol at the firing range, returns home to find Lester feeling great too. He is dazzled by how she looks and comes onto her, reminding her of her wild college days."

","Alright, it is one of those movies that you don't really understand well because it is one of those that leaves you with an open ending and at your own to conclude the reflections of your inside more than anything else. One thing I can guarantee you is that you won't get bored. The story is entertaining with all the elements necessary; great actors Spacey and Benning, beautiful girls, and a story that is pretty much yours or one of your neighbors/friends/acquaintances.<br/><br/>So, the story you know quite well. The name of the lead character is Lester so you can guess the mood. He is leading the ordinary life of our everyday and this is why exactly the movie is so scary. The movie is trying to show us that though our life is simple and predictable because of the routine surrounding, it can lead us to many complications and ends in a very tragic way like Lester's. Look at your life, as boring as it is currently, can't you see that you can guess the rest of your days easily? Doesn't it scare you? That's why sometimes you need to add some dangerous elements to it like having feelings to your daughter's best friend, smoking drugs, or any other destructive activity.

","It was a Saturday morning with some friends, and I felt enlightening them with the satire American Beauty by Sam Mendes. I feel American Beauty is delivering a different dimension of dysfunction. The characters all have their own tales to tell, and the main character isn't the hero as expected.<br/><br/>This movie puts us in the shoes of an middle-aged office worker Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) who is in a terrible 20 year marriage to Carolyn (Annette Bening), the real estate agent. When Lester and his wife reluctantly attends their daughter Jane's cheer leading performance, Lester develops an infatuation with her beautiful blond friend Angela Hayes. Lester has fantasies about Angela involving bright red rose petals, and reverts to his 'glory days' of 1973 to impress her and boost his self esteem. Their neighbor Ricky, who's father is a strict marine core officer, is interested in Jane and video tapes a variety of strange things, including her. The relationship between Ricky and Jane is the most stable or loving of them all, although Jane's parents are negligent and unstable, while Ricky's dad is abusive and his mom is aging and incapable of helping anybody in her mental state.<br/><br/>A notable aspect was the film's narration. Lester is obviously exhausted from his 42 years of surviving, and says he needs a change. There is a recurring shot of his tree-lined street, as his monotone voice flows from the speakers. Its importance is for Lester's character to describe the apathy he is feeling, but without the drama of his everyday life overwhelming the viewer. The shot recurs seldom in the movie for a slight emphasis on how hectic and pathetic his messed up life is. His wife is cheating on him, a high school student is seducing him and his daughter is dating his drug dealer. It can't get too much worse for Lester Burnham.<br/><br/>Another striking feature of the film is the color scheme. Different colors appear in different emotionally or sexually charging scenes in the film. When Lester dreams about Angela, her blond hair is combined with bright red-for instance- as Lester is gazing into his ceiling, he sees a nude Angela with the reddest roses ever digitally created surrounding her and floating back onto him. Those petals contrast with the blue-gray pajamas and sheets he is wearing. The exotic instrumental music behind it creates a visually and audibly interesting scene.<br/><br/>This definitely is an American Beauty. It is one of my favorite films, although I would admit it's an acquired taste. It has a disordering plot, engaged narration, and vivid colors to establish important themes. ""There are so many beautiful things in the world"", and this is one of them."

","Everyone has got one. For some people it is The Godfather, others it is Apocalypse Now, and for some it is 2001: A Space Odyssey. Regardless, everyone has got a favourite film. American Beauty just happens to be mine. I've seen this movie more times than any other, and every time I watch it I love it more and more. There is always something new to see and something new to learn from it, like life itself.<br/><br/>When whoever it was that quipped the now age-old adage 'they don't make them like that any more', they didn't account for American Beauty. It is without question a 'modern' classic, yet it seems to span the ages of cinema with such frightening ease that it could have easily been made 10, 20, 50 years ago. It takes all that is good about cinema and encapsulates it in 122 minutes.<br/><br/>It's so difficult to describe exactly what makes this my favourite film of all time, but I'll try. Every nuance, every idiosyncrasy, every scene, shot and sound blends so delicately and perfectly with the last and the next that you often forget you are watching a film. Suspension of disbelief doesn't even begin to describe what the viewer is subjected to on this remarkable journey of an unremarkable man, who just wants another chance to live life before it leaves him behind for good.<br/><br/>It's the myriad of human feelings, emotions and traits on show that make American Beauty what it is. It's tragic, hilarious, gut-wrenching, spine-tingling and awe-inspiring all at the same time. The characters are hewn of solid granite, so incredibly well developed and matured that you know at least two or three in real life. The direction is nothing short of majestic, the camera work sublime and the script is proof of the theory that at times, life imitates art.<br/><br/>There is no point in describing what happens during the running time, because to be perfectly honest, it's been done a hundred times on these boards. What I will say though is that this film may well leave you asking a thousand questions of yourself and others after watching it, and on the flip side, many questions you had already asked are answered. It is a film about the human condition, the human spirit and human endeavour. It works on levels that 99% of other films cannot even begin to aspire to. If you haven't yet had the pleasure of watching it yet, I implore you to do so today - you certainly wont regret it.<br/><br/>I'm rating this movie at 9.4 / 10 - the highest rating I have ever given to any film. Spellbinding, devastating stuff."

","From the opening moments of the movie, we know Lester Burnham is going to die; we just do not know the specifics, nor do we realize how little the knowledge of his demise will detract from our enjoyment of the film leading up to this final act. Things appear to be perfectly fine in the Burnham household: Lester and Carolyn are both gainfully employed, have a large, beautiful house in suburbia, drive luxury automobiles and their healthy, robust teenaged daughter is a cheerleader on the high school squad. Yet, every seasoned film-goer knows to never trust appearances. Carolyn's career as a real estate agent isn't going well, so she's hoping that sleeping with the enormously successful real estate king will help rub off some of his fortune. Lester, on the other hand, doesn't have a career; he has a job. In fact, he has had the same job with the same employer for several years. The distinction between ""career"" and ""job"" is vitally important to those of us who merely have a ""job."" Sure, it might pay reasonably well, though not necessarily. A ""job,"" however, is not something we envision ourselves doing for the rest of our lives and it is certainly not how we define ourselves. In fact, we would rather not respond when asked what we do for a living. It simply does not matter to us. What is worse, Lester does not have a sense of identity. ""That's okay. I wouldn't remember me either,"" he responds when one of his wife's acquaintances mistakenly thinks they are meeting for the first time. Perhaps not many people can identify with this, though I certainly can. Lester and I are equally unremarkable, failing to make an impression on most people we meet. Maybe at one point in the past, or even still today deep down, we want to remain anonymous. It does have its advantages at times. It is often frustrating or embarrassing, however, and we realize this. Sometimes when people are indistinct, yet want to be noticed, they resort to drastic tactics. This is how murder sprees happen. But I digress. Rather than murder people, Lester nonetheless does take radical measures. With an unloving wife and a daughter who finds him an embarrassment, he chooses to quit everything in an effort to start over. In a quest to redefine himself, he returns to life the way it was before he was supposed to define himself. He was much more comfortable then. ""I want the job with the least amount of responsibility,"" he tells the teenaged manager of the fast food restaurant at which he applies for a job. Few responsibilities, not accountable to anyone and no one accountable to him; hanging out, lifting weights and smoking pot; this is life the way it was meant to be. Unfortunately for Lester, the young man (Wes Bentley) supplying him with weed happens to have an authoritarian, unenlightened father (Chris Cooper) with a particularly strong homophobic streak. Some misunderstandings occur and trouble ensues.

","This film looks very realistic. This is maybe what I like most of all in it. I am 20 years younger than Lester, but watching this movie I thought: yes, it COULD be a next-door drama of a middle-aged neighbor... and it could happen to me, too. Later. So - dialogs are good, actors' play is good. All characters are shown convincing and displayed in quite enough details.<br/><br/>I'd strongly advice to watch this film - you will have a lot of things to discuss after, with your friends or relatives.

","For this wonderful masterpiece of a film. Such brilliant direction, powerful acting and superb writing that is hard to measure up to nowadays. The list of characters is one of the most astounding creations of story-telling ever. <br/><br/>First off is Lester Burnham, a self-pitiful somewhat loser who goes through a midlife crises. His overbearing, sexually frustrated, all-too-perfect wife Carolyn drives him into rebelling against her outrageous authority and control over his life. His snotty spoiled brat of a teenage daughter, Jane, is not so popular at school, unlike her 16 year old friend Angela Hayes, who raves about her sexual encounters with various men. Much to Jane's repulsion, her father develops an obsession for Angela, having sexual fantasies about her, surrounding beds, bathtubs and kisses with rose petals. He also meets an unforgettable character, Ricky Fits, his next door neighbor, son of Colonel Frank Fits, an open and proud homophobic who is tightly closeted himself. These reasons become Lester's ultimate wake up call and he starts living his life as he has always dreamed it, like quitting his job to work in a fast-food restaurant, smoking pot and lifting weights to ""look good naked"".<br/><br/>Ricky Fits, who becomes Jane Burnham's boyfriend, sees the world through a different perspective, like a painting of the world, rather than what it naturally represents.<br/><br/>""Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it, like my heart's going to cave in."""

","American Beauty is slightly different from some movies I've seen. However, it isn't one that I would willingly choose to watch again. It's like a British Movie, showing more than one life and through different people's eyes. This movie gives the characters more realistic character traits till the point where you wonder how such people could exist, both in a positive and negative way.<br/><br/>I did enjoy seeing how Ricky stalked Jane because of herself and paid attention to her and not her arrogant ""friend"", Angela. It was refreshing to see someone love someone for who they are and not for their boobs or legs. It was sweet. <br/><br/>The thing that I thought was disgusting was the fact that Lester (Spacey) fell in love with Angela, who is his daughter's age. It's just aggravating to keep seeing movies where the father falls for some younger chick and the mother has an affair with some rich dude. It's not new, it's not different, it just shows how twisted life has become, how no one really takes anything seriously anymore unless it ends up with sex. For instant, Lester only works out and changes because his desire is to be buff enough to have Angela asking to have sex with him. <br/><br/>To me, it was a disturbing movie. The plot was different and the camera shots were good. But I'm getting sick of movies were the old man wants to have sex with a twelve year old. If this is American Beauty, then people don't really know what beauty is."

","American Beauty (1999) Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Wes Bentley, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, Peter Gallagher, Allison Janney, Chris Cooper. Original, satiric punch about a man (Spacey) living in swanky suburbia-who's not respected by the people around him including his family-with the fear of growing older; his wife Bening is a real estate agent who breaks down when she loses a sale, and teenage daughter Birch is a perturbed soul. But Spacey's life changes when he lands his eyes on his daughter's 16-year-old cheerleading friend, whom he fantasizes about and makes him want to forget about his pathetic life to explore his manly hood. A bittersweet, transcending, and earnest look at the American Dream, though to others, it may seem like a high-class soap opera. Oscar winner of three including Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Director (Sam Mendes). Running Time: 122 minutes and rated R for sexual content, nudity, language, violence, and drug content. ***"
"myrrth_sicopath","7","0","0","4 October 2003"," Kevin Spacey brings humor to a self-obsessed world
","I remember when this movie came out, it got acknowledgment from nearly all of my friends as an amazing movie, and then went on to win Best Picture. Due to some twist of fate I didn't see it until a few months ago, and I think that helps to give my opinion a more unbiased light; I'm not caught up in the rush.<br/><br/>I watched this movie with my best friend, and I'll be honest, we thought it was hilarious. Both of us thoroughly enjoyed Kevin Spacey and his very acerbic realism, because we felt he was the only realistic character, and had been stuck in the middle of a crazy, neurotic world where he was the only one looking at the world through the eyes of sardonic humor and intelligence. Let me explain.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>The scene wherein Kevin Spacey ruins his wife's first impression with someone she thoroughly admires, The King (of real estate), is absolutely hilarious. It really shows how much he doesn't belong in what is otherwise, a boring and predictable soap opera.<br/><br/>The scene wherein the neighbor's son is showing Thora Birch a video of a plastic bag, and claiming it holds such life and beauty, is hilarious. That he focuses on this inanimate bag in a gust of wind for SO LONG is very funny; it isn't deep, it isn't meaningful, it is a PLASTIC BAG! I really hope that wasn't supposed to be serious, because I felt that it implied how little people understood about what life was. If he spent this much time admiring a plastic bag, he wouldn't have ever found his way home.<br/><br/>The scene wherein Kevin Spacey pictures Mena Suvari dancing alone for him is hilarious. Such artistry is given to a scene that implies pedophilia; the true humor is in the obvious fact that she had no idea what he was thinking. Reminiscent of the scene in Pulp Fiction where Lucius Wallace pictures Tarantino's wife as black just because he is.<br/><br/>*END SPOILERS*<br/><br/>I couldn't fathom how people thought this movie was anything more than a sardonic comedy about Kevin Spacey being a character, obviously out of place, in a soap opera drama. He is what brings life to this movie, and he casts a more unrealistic and silly light over some of the other bizarre and ultimately pointless events.<br/><br/>Don't think that this is a BAD movie... but just consider that, in my opinion, it isn't deep at all. But for what it is, it's very, very enjoyable. 7/10"

","Take the movie Office Space, expand it to the work-and-family-life setting, throw in some drama and depth, and sprinkle shallow metaphors on the top and you have American Beauty.  The film is not without its good points and charms, however, it's somewhat over hyped in reviews.  Certainly not award worthy, but then again, like the Oscars would know anything about award worthy material.<br/><br/>It earns points for exploring a narrative angle I've never quite seen before in live action cinema (even if it does borrow heavily from the `let's-make-a-movie-about losers' film trend like with Clerks, Office Space, Straight Story.)  At least American Beauty is about fictitious characters and their portrayals remind of Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands, that other-worldly, suburban-storybook-ish, caricature-or in other words: none of the characters in American Beauty are real, but we don't care.  It's not supposed to be.  I won't bash them for being unrealistic, but I will criticize them for boring me.<br/><br/>I found Kevin Spacey's character the most entertaining, but then again I always like the characters who stop giving a damn and start speaking the thoughts we all want to say to the people around us.  Beyond Kevin Spacey's performance and his character, not a single character throughout the rest of the film managed to keep my interest.  Beyond that, none of the characters managed to acquire credibility in my mind.  So with a cast of one interesting character, I didn't feel like lending my imagination to this film, didn't feel like getting into this film's world or suspending my disbelief too terribly far for it (ie this film really did nothing to capture my interest.)<br/><br/>The provocative' plot points came across as rhetorical and pseudo-philosophical instead of something genuinely worthy of discussion; the characters these provocative snippets come from seemed quite cliché and typical of what you'd expect to hear from them: the meaning, pleasures, and importance of life and beauty from a loser and a freak respectively.  `Don't judge a book by its cover.'  Lesson learned.  Moral earned.  How ironic! Been there.  Done that.  Bored me there too.<br/><br/>I do appreciate American Beauty's lack of a serious attempt at a plot.  It moves along at its own pace, documenting the loose correlations of isolated events at key points in the timeline about these characters.  Like with Kevin Smith's Clerks, American Beauty proves how overrated plot is and attempts to build on the characters alone and their lives, trials, and tribulations.  The result is a quirky original film, which I love original and like quirky . . . but since I cared very little for the characters and the philosophy I didn't really like this quirky original film."

","I waited a long time to see this as nothing I heard about the film seemed interesting. Now, I am glad I waited and went to the less expensive matinee.<br/><br/>I am left feeling that America has an awfully short memory. There is nothing in this film that hasn't been done, story-wise, before. A lot of the themes seemed to be left over from an earlier age. Vacuous teens and the pathetic lives of the materialistic middle-class were done to death in the sixties and seventies, with better sex too. I had hoped to see something more original but I guess a lot of very young movie goers will never see all the old films so this is their introduction to some very tired, overworked old themes. That left me wondering out loud what all the hoopla has been about, so I tried to find something redeeming here.<br/><br/>The director did a good job with the material he had. Not too hard to stand above that script. (music, costumes and sets were mundane, nothing striking, but well executed for the setting.)<br/><br/>The acting was the one saving grace. Spacey and Benning played characters I have known. They gave realism to the pathos. Their portrayals with the material they were handed was excellent. The real standouts (because of their newness) were the younger actors and actresses (ladies, there is nothing wrong with being female).<br/><br/>Wes Bently showed real talent in his restrained portrayal of the edgy - otherwise stereotypical - young rebel. He saved what could have been a joke.<br/><br/>There has been a lot of talk about Mena Suvari in this film. She was OK, but nothing to live up to all the hype, foul mouth notwithstanding. (Note: I am fully aware that hoards of young girls now talk like this character. It is not cute or funny, it's kind of pathetic, which was the point I suppose.)<br/><br/>The real shining talent here was Thora Birch as Jane. She managed to breath what little life there was into this film while managing to look much better than Suvari doing it; no mean feat. She is stunning in both talent and beauty and there is a great future for this fine young talent, as well as the others.<br/><br/>Chris Cooper's portrayal was true to the script, I am sure, but it left me with ""Huge Hollywood Stereotype"" running through my mind. His acting was excellent, the script wasn't up to what he brought to it. The character was disappointing, in the least. Allison Janney as his very disturbed wife was a little over the top too. It left me thinking the screenwriter and director were both really straining to paint villainy with these two characters. It smelled. Has no one heard of originality? Nicholson did the last credible evil Marine Colonel. There may never be another.<br/><br/>That about does it for me. I know I sat near the rear of the theater and saw four couples leave shortly after the garbage mouth scene from Suvari. I think she did it well, though. Too bad this is what we have degenerated to. She doesn't represent some far-out rebel, but a main-stream young woman. How sad.<br/><br/>As for the film's theme, decadent America has been done to death, so forget it and look for something new, will ya? I would have even liked to see Benning naked more than Suvari, at least that might have been more real and seemed less crude, crass, exploitative and pedophiliac. Besides, she's every bit as beautiful as the younger girls in this film."

","Sam Mendes of Road to Perdition fame first directed American Beauty a haunting, sad, and funny life of suburbia gone wrong. Kevin Spacey, who won a Best Actor Oscar for his role, is Lester Burnham, a depressed 40's husband with a droll job in a magazine. He's constantly pushed around, especially by his successful real estate wife Carolyn (Annette Benning) and his rebellious teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch). He decides to get noticed and not be the scab that everyone flicks at.<br/><br/>First, he blackmails his boss; he does drugs, and others, to name some. Carolyn starts to see a rival real estate dealer (Peter Gallagher), Jane falls for a voyeuristic new neighbor Ricky (Wes Bentley), who is supplying Lester with his drugs. Lester also falls for Jane's best friend Angela (Mena Suvari), while his father, recent Oscar winner Chris Cooper, abuses Ricky. Although these stories do not seem to have anything in common, they flow together simply.<br/><br/>As I was watching this movie, I was reminded of two movies: Far From Heaven and Ghost World. The former had an affluent family with one problem that leads to the next, while the latter, besides that they both star Thora Birch, have troubled high schoolers. I thought that the acting was capital. Spacey was an `all-singing-all-dancing crap of the world' who slowly turned himself into something greater. I thought that this transformation was simply amazing, and so was Spacey's acting. It was just outstanding. I really felt for him. Benning was also very good, but I understand why she didn't win an Oscar, and she cried too much.<br/><br/>One thing I enjoyed about this film is that it accurately portrayed upper-middle class families. They have special sofas, luxury SUVs, and more. Although the people there only think materialistically, they have no idea that everything can turn to shambles. However, Jane realizes that her life isn't normal, and she doesn't do anything about it. Birch was great, too, but nowhere near as great as her performance in Ghost World. All of the others were great too. I especially liked Suvari's Angela, who thinks she is perfect and shuns her inner feelings. I also liked the `twist' that Ricky's father undergoes.<br/><br/>Small aspects make or break a movie. Here, they make it. The music was simply outstanding, sometimes sad, sometimes happy and gleeful. Also, the cinematography was great. Billed as a dramedy, it succeeded in both parts, but not was much as it could have. I didn't laugh as much as I wished, and I wasn't as touched as I wanted to be. Other than that, I really loved taking this trip down the not-so-long-ago.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for strong sexuality, language, violence and drug content."

In the end, Lester died, and that was all there was to it.  It was such a beautiful story I can;t believe it.  I don't see a lot of movies, but I have to say, that is the most touching movie i have ever seen."

","what an amazing movie. Truly the millenniums first classic slice of great cinema. This is as life defining, and as life altering as the fantastic dead poet's society. The film is wonderfully shot, and directed. Full of colour and jaw dropping gorgeousness. The movies score ranks as one of the most beautiful in film history. With it's quiet, sparkly piano's and echoey spooky synths. All the actors give great performances, most notably wes bentley, chris cooper, and of course kevin spacey. And the script, by alan ball, is precise and incredibly knowing of life's small but memorable moments.

","American Beauty (1999) D: Sam Mendes. Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari, Peter Gallagher, Allison Janney, Chris Cooper, Scott Bakula, Sam Robards. Thought-provoking, realistic tale of a midlife crisis. A first person account of one man's quest to turn his life around and how he turns everyone else's life into a living hell as a result. This film has everything: humor, drama, violence, and several plot twists. The acting, especially by Spacey, is superb and the twist ending is a nice added touch. Certainly not for all tastes, as the subject matter is less than squeaky clean. RATING: 9 out of 10. Rated R for strong sexual situations, profanity, violence, and drug use."

"khouston86","Null","0","0","17 March 2003"," Good, but Donnie Darko is far better
","This is a good movie.  It accurately presents adult feelings of wanting to feel alive and in love and loved and desired and younger.  But the movie is depressing for its own sake, and that doesn't elevate it to the status of high art.  You don't have to be boring and wear black and hang out constantly in coffee houses or love Fight Club to be deep.  The irony is that what Spacey's character is after is more joy, but I doubt many of American Beauty's (or Fight Club's) fans are joyful, truly passionate, courageously passionate people.  Those types of people will prefer Donnie Darko, and they will get to use their brains, as well as their hearts, so much more intensely watching that film.  Indeed, Mendes' follow-up effort, The Road to Perdition, deals adeptly and emotionally with fathers and sons and is probably a better movie than American Beauty."
"garb-1","10","0","0","13 March 2003"," Still my favourite
","A bizarre and poignant tale about two poles apart: the idea about safety and success, and the personal reality of the Burnhams, their loneliness and empty comformity. It's not hard to identify ourselves with the characters, almost all of us have felt years go by, we could lose faith in the possibility of true and sincere love, and we were not accepted. American Beauty points out the absurdity of the character and the bounds of life, but forgives those who want to live in a different way. It is more than the satire only of the American mid-class: a mirror to people everywhere who live in a rut of indifference."

","1999 would be known for the year of great movies. ""American Beauty"" really puts the ""d"" in dysfunction. This movie dealt with a lot of egotism in everyone's lives. Kevin Spacey really played his role well enough to get an Oscar. Being an unhappy yutz is one thing, but living the life he now would be murder(hence the fact). Spacey will make magic in just about any movie he makes. ""The Negotiator"" was suspenseful when learns the truth about his superiors. In the movie here, learns how to regain his ""lost youth"" at a time of crisis. Thora Birch was really awesome playing a daughter who downright insecure, and is spooked by the next door neighbor with a camera watching her every move. The most intriguing part of the movie is when she really came out of her ""shell"" to the neighbor. BOLD MOVE, but I'm not going too far with that detail, NO WAY!

","Midlife crisis:  it's something we've come to expect from middle-aged men. And we've all seen the stereotypical manifestations:  a `normal' guy goes out and buys a Harley, or has an affair, or just becomes a royal jackass around the house - more so than usual, that is.  It's so damned clichÃ©.<br/><br/>American Beauty transcends the plethora of hackneyed truisms about midlife crisis for one reason:  it deals with the social and cultural forces that produce it, and not just the dramatic changes that come midway through life, changes that Jung insisted are inevitable.  The difference between American Beauty's Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) and Married with Children's Al Bundy is the difference between Dante's middle aged man who, awakened, enters a deep, `dark wood,' the creative and spiritual side of life (not without it's perils!), and Sinclair Lewis's `Babbitt,' who boasted that he had never done anything he wanted to do.  It's the difference between following one's bliss, and stashing one's life on a shelf until the balance of years expires.  It's brilliant because when Lester Burnham, who used to be a Babbitt, reforms his Babbitt-like ways, he pisses off all the other Babbitts, especially his wife and next door neighbors, the `Fitts.'  With Babbitts everywhere to be found, it's not a wonder that a midlife crisis is necessary.  It is a wonder that anyone succeeds in finding the dark wood, and not an ersatz experience, like the herds of men with leather jackets and Harleys.<br/><br/>What's more, the conflict between Lester Burnham and everyone else is not only pithy social satire, it's outrageously comical.  Anette Bening is simply brilliant as Lester's wife, who is anal, materialistic, and completely fanatical about financial success.  (She was robbed of the Academy Award in 1999, I think.)  Her daughter's phony friend spots her immediately as a phony (takes one to know one), as she effuses fake good cheer and beneficence.  I've worked with people like that.  Let me tell you, they can kill your spirit.  They can make you sick.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, rent it."
"WriterDave","10","0","0","6 March 2003"," Smart, Subversive, Contrived, and Forever Open for Debate
","""American Beauty"" is one of those rare and audacious films that begs the question, ""what defines art?""  I don't think there is a film that received better pre-release hype, more overwhelming praise when it was released, and more cries of ""FINALLY!"" when it swept the Oscars.  Yet it has spawned some of the most heated backlash of any film in recent memory.  Does the fact that it has created so much debate make it art?  Maybe. <br/><br/>
This is a film that subverts the traditional American ideal of suburban life.  The moments of ""conversation"" at the dinner table are both the most horrific and funniest moments ever put to film.  They resonate at both ends of the spectrum because they ring so true.  Who hasn't been a part of or witnessed such tantrums at the dinner table, a place where families are supposed to connect and rejoice in their everyday life?  Does this type of subversion define art?  Maybe.<br/><br/>This is a film that was very deliberate in its direction.  Plastic bags and rose petals have never been more beautifully shot, or more pretentious. Suburban streets have never looked this good, and white picket fences never whiter.  But again, there's something crackling under the veneer, both of this film, and of the life it depicts.  Is this what art is supposed to do? I think so.<br/><br/>The performances are phenomenal from Spacey and Benning.  The script is ultra smart and ultra clever, but in the end probably too contrived.  Was the message of the film that our ""American dream"" is also too contrived, just like this movie?  Or was the message that even suburban schmucks like Lester Burnham deserve a chance to live out an authentic life of their own choosing?  We may never know.  I actually think that twenty or thirty years from now this movie will be looked upon as one of the all time greats by critics, with the then modern-day audiences perplexed and asking, ""why?"" That, my friends, is art."

","But most American men who are either fathers or not fantasize at least sometimes about teenage girls that are either their daughters friends, or son's girlfriends, etc.  This movie was actually very disturbing, but like most of the guys on imdb.com, they voted for this pretty much not because they liked the movie, but because they liked the drug content as well as Mena Suvari baring her breasts at the near conclusion to the film.  As a movie this movie really disturbed me as I saw it Oscar week before it won, and I was all by my lonesome in the huge theatre on a week night.  It pictured the American Family as screwed up beyond all hope, and I have a hard time believing that every seemingly nice person I meet is either a drug dealer, adultress, or pedophile.

","Undoubtedly the best film of 1999, American Beauty won best picture and rightfully so. I believe it deserved more praise than it got, actually, and should have gotten nominations for Chris Cooper definitely, and its teens, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch, gave the best angsty performances since Timothy Hutton won for Ordinary People. The film does have its flaws, mind you, as do all films, but the idea is brilliant, the execution done well, and the acting superb. The film's pacing is off a little, and at times it feels it has an incredible introduction (probably one of the best beginnings I've ever seen of a movie), and a powerful ending, but no middle. This has little bearing, and, indeed, I do feel this movie was almost perfect, though people may think me over-zealous.<br/><br/>The film's take on the issue of homosexuality gets somewhat heavy-handed at times and overdone, but it is a small issue. I found this movie the most emotional and raw film I have ever seen about life in suburbia. It says so much about life, consequence, love, and loss. It deals with characters with incredible flaws, some doing things that can't be forgiven, but the audience always feels compassion for them all. It is by no means predictable, but doesn't dwell on its surprises. I really believe this movie is life-changing. A film everyone should see!"

The acting is absolutly outstanding with great performances from Annete Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper, Wes Bently, Mena Suvari and especially Kevin Spacey in his Academy Award Winning role, who gives his best performance since 1995's The Usual Suspects. The plot is very interesting = it's about a man Lester (Kevin Spacey) and his suburban family including his over acheiver real-estate agent wife Caroline (Annete Bening) and his weird and depressed teenage daughter (Thora Birch). After Lester gets layed off he starts to work in a fast food restaurant and smoke pot, which really bothers his wife. Since his wife is fed up with Lester and can't find a way to sell many more houses, she decides to have an affair with a real-estate agent Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) who calls himself ""The King"". The daughter befriends a strange and nice boy (Wes Bently) who is new to the neighborhood, and he also befriends her dad Lester too, and becomes his main pot supplier. There is a hilarious scene in the movie where the new kid's dad (played by Chris Cooper) thinks his son is having an affair with Lester. This film is an excellent film, with great writing and directing too (This is the director, Sam Mendes's first film). The film scored a lot of Academy Awards including Best Actor - Kevin Spacey, Best Director - Sam Mendes, Best Original Screenplay - Alan Ball and Best Picture of the Year. This is an excellent drama and should be acknowleged as one of the best films ever made! People who enjoy this movie will always enjoy the series 'Six Feet Under' who was created by Alan Ball.

"sungwon444","8","0","0","15 February 2003"," Do not misconstrue this film. It's simply a social, satirical film
","Spoiler Alert! I watched American Beauty for the first time last night, and I had mixed feelings about it. I was disgusted with the movie, but at the same time deeply moved. I hated the movie, but also liked it at the same time. It's very hard to describe how I really feel about the movie. One thing about American Beauty is sure. It is thought-provoking and disturbing. Sam Mendes was bold to create a movie that defied the moralistic messages and ""happy endings"" usually found in the best movies such as the Shawshank Redemption.<br/><br/>In my opinion, I believe American Beauty is a satirical movie that depicts the personal problems that can wreck an American family in our society. The thing that baffles me the most is how so many people on this site have said that the characters in American Beauty are all characters we can identify with. Are you kidding me? Sam Mendes never meant for these characters to act as the most ridiculous, base people that can exist in our society. We SHOULD NOT be able to identify ourselves with these pathetic characters.<br/><br/>Look at Lester for example (Kevin Spacey). He represents a father who has absolutely no responsibility or direction in his life. He is a father who lives a life of debauchery and pleasure (shown by sexual passion toward Angela). He is a father who shouldn't even be called a ""father"" since he dosen't care a tad bit about his wife or daughter. Next, we have Karolyn (Annete Benning).<br/><br/>Karolyn represents those people who have no stability in their lives. These are the people who are too systematic, materialistic (shown by the ""Don't spill you beer on this $4000 couch"" incident), and shallow at the same time. She is too obsessed with success and the American Dream, that anything less will surely depress her.<br/><br/>Let's analyze Angela (Mena Suvari) next shall we? Angela, a prideful cheerleader, represents those people who are excessively obsessed with self-image, self-worth, and significance. She's only friends with Jane because she can feel good about herself (since she's ""supposedly"" prettier and more sexualy active than Jane is""). She rants on about her potential to be a model and even lies about her ""active sexuality"" in order to build herself up.<br/><br/>Haha, finally comes the Kernel (or Rikki's dad, played by Chris Cooper). The Kernel represents those people who are unreasonably stubborn and act as ""CONTROL FREAKS."" These people like Rikki's dad only see things their own way and they dictate other people's lives. In fact, the Kernel is so freakin oppresive that he shows no love to his wife, and later, we find out that he's gay (not surprising why).<br/><br/>Like I said, I do not know how people on this site say that they can identify themselves with Kevin Spacey's character, Lester, or Mena Suvari's shallow chracter, Angela. For Heaven's sake, you're not supposed to be! Man, if you can relate to them, I'm kind of concerned about you. These are farcical characters that we're supposed to laugh at while we watch the movie.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, that I haven't talked about all the characters. There are two characters (Thora Birch's role, Jane....and Wes Bently's role, Rikki) whom I respect very much. I respect Jane because she grows up so much in this movie. In the beginning of the movie, she also cares too much about self-image and always depends on her shallow friend, Angela for advise, but as the movie progresses, she learns that self-worth cannot be found by what society tells us that it can be found in (sex, popularity, drugs, money). I feel sorry for Jane since she has horrible, pathetic parents and she has every right to criticize them, because they don't give a d*mn about her. Fortunately, Jane does meet someone she whom she can relate to (Wes Bentley) and we hope they can live happy lives.<br/><br/>The most significant character in my opinion is Wes Bentley as Rikki, a son of a repressive father. Rikki is not a perfect character (he lies, does and sell drugs) but he has true emotions and sees beauty in things that most people don't. He fully appreciate's God's creation while everyone else is ignorant to it. He finds beauty in simple things, a dead bird, a floating plastic bag, and even Jane (whom most people do not find beautiful). I believe Jane and Rikki are the two real and focal characters in this movie.<br/><br/>While everyone else is mentally breaking down, these two chracters have self-worth and composure. They have something to hope about. I think too many people take this movie to far and misinterpret it. This is not a movie shwoing us the truth and realities of American families (if it did, we would be feeling insulted). Instead, it's a satirical movie that pokes fun at people who we would hope not to be like (I sure do hope you people think the same too!).<br/><br/>What a weird and disturbing movie, but at the same time, a beautiful movie....   man, this one is a fun movie to talk about.<br/><br/>A good, but not brilliant movie (movies like Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, and the Green Mile surpass this one). I give this one 8 out of 10 stars."

","First off, the idea of sounding the Death Gong for suburbia had been done perfectly a year earlier by Todd Solondz's ""Happiness"". No one else could improve his ideas. ""Donnie Darko"" had to incorporate Time Travel and a demonic rabbit to take Todd's ideas further.<br/><br/>Secondly, all of the characters in ""American Beauty"" are horrible cardboard cut-outs of human beings. And that WASN'T intentional. It was just bad writing. A self-loathing homophobic ex-military character? How is that not a stereotype? Hey, Allen Ball, how long did it take you to come up with that one? Or the career minded mother who has NO redeaming qualities? Mena Suvari's character was the only one with any substance, but she looks like a martian and I can't buy into the idea that Lester is really attacted to her or what she stands for.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the heavy hand of the director or author's voice manifests in the character who constantly carries around a CAMERA and NEVER MAKES A MISTAKE. That is a poorly conceived and executed idea. It's like they think their audience is dumb and needs to be spoon fed principles of symbolism. I can picture the process of creating that character. I bet Mr. Ball and Mr. Mendes thought it was a great idea. That's a huge part of the problem.<br/><br/>There is a principle in writing called ""Killing Your Baby"". If you have an idea you think is good, the only way you can be sure is if you dismantle the idea. If you can dismantle it, and the idea retains its goodness, then the idea is good. In the dismantling process, you can find the problems in the idea and fix them.<br/><br/>Some of the problems with Ricky Fitts are a little obvious, like the fact that he is a dramatic character who is unfaltering and without any tangible conflict. Oooh, he hates his ex-military disciplinarian father. Ooooh. It's just another two-dimensional aspect. A truer conflict would be if he resented the homophobia and disciplinarianism but also loved his father very, very much.<br/><br/>If anything, American Beauty shows that you can take a horrible script, give to talented actors, dress it up with slow fades, pans, and tracking shots, top it off with a great soundtrack, and fool millions of Americans into thinking it is a great work of art. Really what you have is a pretentious, heavy handed, and dumbed down soap opera quality flick. At least the title has some irony.<br/><br/>btr<br/><br/>Dave Hendrick"

I dream of being Kevin Spacey and changing my world around. I hope desperately that something will rescue me from my drudgery, just as he is saved by his mid life crisis.

Its the small things that get me. things like ""sometimes i feel there is too much beauty in the world"" and scenes like the plastic bag.<br/><br/>Also : The music is sensational. without the music, the movie would be half of what it is. But the music is appropriate and plays with your emotions like it was your ex girl friend.<br/><br/>Some say its a guy flick, and it is..as much as ""apocalypse now"" and ""seven samurai"" etc, though less of an epic. Guys would defnly relate to it more, since the women in the movie are underplayed. And annete defnly isnt a member of the stereotype in this movie. theres no susan sarandon or oprah winfrey here for the women to relate to. (i think thats a good thing..the world has too many chick flicks)<br/><br/>This movie somehow falls short of being an epic, all time greats movie, mainly because of its cliched roots and subject matter..(something like jerry maguire..the movies great..but the subject is just soo done) and no matter how different or good it is..it doesnt escape its own ordinariness, much like the movies characters.<br/><br/>Definitely a nine out of ten. I would give 9.5 if i could. Its really sad that spacey hasnt produced anything better since this movie."

","As I write this, I realise that I'm ruining the symmetry...1999 comments on a film made in 1999!<br/><br/>Anyway, this film quite rightly hails as one of the best films ever made. Sam Mendes deserved that Oscar so badly for Best Director - not bad considering that this was his debut - but was denied for some reason (could it be because he aint American... sorry to my fellow wonderful Americans, but I'm pretty cynical when it comes to things like this...). Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening definitely deserved Best Actor/Actress and the overall film, surprise surprise, was Best Film.<br/><br/>Having said that, I saw this film on a recommendation from a friend (she thought it was awful!) and loved it immediately. I bought the video and watched it three times back-to-back, each time it was different. How many films can say that?<br/><br/>I'm biased in a way because I count Kevin Spacey in my all-time top 5 actors (currently he's #1), having seen him in The Usual Suspects and LA Confidential, but this film was different. At least as clever as the others but more thought-provoking. It made you look deeper at what these normal people were like on the inside. Lester Burnham's regression to an almost adolescent indifference to the rules of life is amazing. I'm not afraid to say that the ending has made me cry on more than one occasion.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd give the film 10/10 without hesitation or reservation. See this film at least once. I thought it was excellent, so hopefully you'll get some satisfaction from it (Mena Suvari, gentlemen?!)"

I do not like to criticise films, i only look at the good points, and this film had many. (watch out, spoiler coming...) I laughed when lester was caught masturbating and when he and ricky were caught smoking a doobie behind the building. I cried at the irony of a mixed up Colonel Fitts hating all gays. And i was awe struck at how on the outside, such a possibly mundane film could be so utterly engrossing.

","I have to admit, when I first saw this movie I did not like it. At all. I thought that it was immensely boring and not at all funny. I couldn't understand why it had recieved so much praise and all those Oscars! It wasn't until about the third or forth viewing that I actually started to like it. A lot. <br/><br/>While I find the music boring and very annoying at times, everything else about this film is fantastic. The repetitive use of roses is such a pretty touch - forgive me for sounding girlie, but it captures the essence of beauty that the film is deliberately pointing at. I really like the 'repeating' of single shots - the bit where Lester is imagining Angela dancing for him during the cheerleading scene and she looks over her shoulder at him. <br/><br/>After seeing this film about 6 or 7 times now, I can fully understand the Best Picture and Best Director Oscars now - it's an original, strange and yet beautiful film that I think everyone should watch at least twice.

","One of the three post-modern must see films (along with Fight Club and The Matrix). American Beauty is the stand-out American feature of the time. It's just one of those good films, one which i can't see anyone disliking. It has a plot, and is crafted perfectly; one for the critics and the movie-goers. One for society; what IS American Beauty? So many things are said in this film, that you'll take enjoyment from it time and time again. I cannot stress how much you should see it.<br/><br/>The film takes us through the life of the suburbian white American family, the father, mother and daughter. Alongside them, we have another, father, mother and son. The story chronicles their relationships, their absurdities, and questions almost every facet of society, and the pretence of it all.<br/><br/>It is not something which will make you cringe with politics, all this can be escaped should you want to not see it. You don't have to sit and wonder at the iconography either(why the roses, why red?), or wonder about mise en scene, and why things are so bland, the greatness in it lies in the fact that it IS there, should you want to, but isn't the focus point of the film.<br/><br/>It has everything. Titilation (in the bluntest sense!), thought, feeling and humour. So much so that it cannot be categorised. Watch it, you'll see. American-Beautiful!"

","American Beauty exemplifies a broadway play on film.  There's no usage of camera trickery or fascinating shot perspectives, rather, Sam Mendes uses his playhouse background to demonstrate the use of music, lighting, and strong storyline (Alan Ball).  The color contrast that appears on the screen in terms of RED (front door, roses, etc.) is simply authentic and stands out making an exclamation.  And the plot is well thought out by Alan Ball.<br/><br/>There's more to this storyline than just a disfunctional family (which is such a simplified definition of the movie).  Each character is played to a tee by its actor counterpart, in terms of depth and inner analysis.  The character of Lester (Kevin Spacey) is a triumph of a man that gains confidence and finds what made him happy.  Carol (Annette Bening) is one word...POWER - in all aspects of the definition.  Thora Birch (Jane) and Mena Suvari (Angela) were strong characters of the embellished problems during a high school lifestyle in terms of lost identity, questions of love, and parental influence.<br/><br/>When such good acting, strong screenplay, and quintessencial use of lighting, directing, and correct use of music....why would it be a wonder to its oscar winnings?"

","(Spoiler alert!) At first I thought this movie was just an ordinary dull problem family drama, but then it started doing parody of that kind of stuff. No wonder American Beauty is so popular, Lester Burnham does about everything an ordinary fellow dreams about doing some day but is just too scared to try. Seemed like everyone was ready to kill him and it was only about who was going to do it first. I guessed the right person, probably because I missed a few minutes from the beginning on the first time watching and didn't get affected by the scene where his daughter hires the boy next door to kill him. But then it was the Colonel after all. Never believed the wife could actually shoot Leslie, all though she was mad, and at least not when he was staring the family photos. That would have been too thick. A great ending anyway, for some reason the main character getting shot is always a good selection."

The father, Colonel Fitts, a marine nazi fanatic with homophobia, his deranged wife Barbara and their 18 year old son Ricky, a peeping tom, who films everything he can with his video camera. At a highschool basketball match, Lester sees the cheerleader slash so-called friend of Jane's called Angela and he steps into midlife-crisis mode, has a teenage crush on Angela and starts working out just to impress her. Everything around Lester seems to be falling apart when he quits his job, his wife starts having an affair and his teenage daughter gets involved with the drug dealer slash peeping tom Ricky. All Lester seems to care about is Angela and his body.....<br/><br/>A hilarious movie with lots of quick sarcastic remarks from everyone.

Conrad Hall's beautiful cinematography and Alan Ball's darkly comedic and incredibly brilliant screenplay exaggerates to varying degrees all aspects of the modern American family, to create a startling film that is both a caricature and a portrait.

","There are very few movies which I've watched and instantly fallen in love with, but this definitely has to be one of them. So why is this movie supposed to be so good? Here's why...<br/><br/>Lester Burnham is simply the anithesis of the anti-hero. He is stuck in a dead-end job, receives little support or loving contact through his wife, and his only daughter seems to despise him. However one day he meets his daughter's friend (played by Mira Sorvino) and is instantly transfixed. This sets off a rebellion insider him, encouraging him to quit his job, fantasise about the girl and smoke illicit substances.<br/><br/>Not exactly a moral, wholesome two-hour experience then? Well, no but neither was the Godfather but people judge that to be a masterpiece. What it is is superbly acted, wonderfully directed and hugely funny. It has some wonderful one-liners (""There is nothing worse than being ordinary"") and possesses real depth. It is a movie that challenges the perception of what you think you are, and how you lead your life, and an analysis of what really makes a person happy.<br/><br/>It is also refreshingly dysfunctional and cynical in its attitudes towards the modern-day suburban ideal in middle America. Love it or hate it, you can't help but discuss this movie for weeks to come."

","Watch American Beauty again and look closer. It is less of a ""film"" and more of one of the most brilliant art ""projects"". It is essentially a montage of scenes that are self contained mini-essays on reflections about the American suburban experience and the collection creates a staggering whole. The pot-smoking scene outside the gym and the angry wife calling for Lester to go home; The video of the shopping bag floating in the air and how it opens up and creates a strong emotional connection between Ricky Fitts and Jane Burnham; Lester working out and checking himself in the reflection of the window is its own little montage about our obsession with ""looking good"", then the movie takes a wonderful twist and seamlessly moves to Ricky filming Lester and we have yet another montage about Ricky and his endless video taping. <br/><br/>This movie is definitely required viewing for any film or art student that wants to see modern movie techniques put to perfect use. All the characters in this movie will never be in a movie as great as this one, it is one of the master strokes of modern cinema.<br/><br/>One of the most ironic things about American Beauty is that it is viewed as a ""mainstream"" comedy-drama movie but it is far from that. If you watch the movie and pay attention to what the director is trying to accomplish in each scene you'll see it is far from ""mainstream"".

I disagree completely, I saw the movie saying that despite these shortcomings the characters may suffer from, they too are human beings despite, and underneath, their foibles.

I didn't see this movie as an attack on anything American, so much as I saw it an attack on what plagues *all* humans; greed, lost youth and insecurity.<br/><br/>Even the ex-Marine, who if this movie were true ""Liberal propaganda"" would *never* be portrayed as a thinking and feeling human, is shown to be an insecure, confused man who despite the facade of fascist-like control is actually plagued by his own demons, and is shown to be very, very human after all. A man who was truer to what others thought was right than a man who was true to himself, and suffered for it to the point where he can't even really be a father no matter how much he wants to.<br/><br/>Pay attention to the messages this movie delivers, rather than whether or not you thought the messenger lived up to your moral standards."

I´m not really a fan of that message.  However, this movie is more about selfishness.  Every character who had a screw loose in this movie (and that´s nearly everybody) got that way because of selfishness.  Their wanting more lead to their downfall. Looking at the movie that way made it a better movie for me.<br/><br/>If I were to give this a rating, I would give it 7/10.

That we should feel enormous gratitude for every little moment in our stupid miserable life. And that we should feel happy and satisfied inside ourselves no matter what happens around us. We should appreciate little things in life and success after all is not everything. Lusts are pure once we understand them and identify the reasons why we have them.

These being the acting, a superb collection of actors featuring the likes of Kevin Spacey (on top form), Annette Bening (also on top form) and supported by the likes of Thora Birch, Wes Bently and Mena Suvari. The movement of the camera is a homage to the director and cinematography and the script is an accomplishment rarely seen since the late 80's. I just hope that Hollywood continue to support Sam Mendes and that we are priveleged to see another piece of his work in the near future that is on par with American Beauty.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"tlarry858","9","0","0","19 October 2002"," American Beauty is a kind of Lolita for the new millennium.
","American Beauty is a kind of Lolita for the new millennium, an imaginative look at contemporary American society. In director Sam Mendes's reappraisal of American mores, that American suburban scene is killingly dull-an oppressive miasma looms depleting the atmosphere of oxygen and covering those captive in its oppressive clouds with a deep layer of pain and angst. What American Beauty chronicles is a collective failure, both of energy and of spirit in American society. What has become defunct in our me-first, dot-com society is our capacity for wonder and our ability to conduct valid human interaction. What we now have, instead, is a tremendous vacuum and a collective longing that must be filled at any price.<br/><br/>The film has the New-Age flavor of people seeking desperately for meaning in their lives and for spiritual sustenance. American Beauty depicts middle-aged suburbanites Lester and Carolyn Burnhams' misguided attempts to exorcise this longing through extra-marital sexual liaisons. These desperate attempts to recapture love and security are obviously doomed from the start. Lester (Kevin Spacey) becomes infatuated with his daughter's beautiful friend, Angela, and Carolyn (Annette Bening) initiates an affair with fellow real estate agent Buddy Kane. These parallel quests to recapture what they have lost-Lester in pursuing the specious passion of youth, and Carolyn by imbibing the Lethe of her career and new love interest-create the dramatic tension of the film.<br/><br/>Lester is a walking dead man. This is not a spoiler; we learn this fact in the first few minutes of the film. The film comprises, then, a kind of retrospective of the dead, a look at what went wrong in Lester's life and marriage-and why. The film does not provide any useful answers for the audience, however, who, we assume, may very well be suffering in some degree the same problems that plagued Lester prior to his death. Any implied solutions are easily negated by the fact that Lester has little time to savor his new-found wisdom, for he is snuffed out, a victim of a cruel twist of fate. And this is not exactly a fair return for one's troubles. Given these considerations, it is difficult for me to believe that Lester especially wanted to die, after finally having solved his angst and his spiritual and sexual frustrations.<br/><br/>Carolyn is not as aware as Lester that there is a deep emptiness in their lives. But she too seeks some value some thing in which to believe, and this becomes here career which soon subsumes all of her other passions and interests (except, perhaps her gardening). In an earlier decade she would have been a political radical, as Eric Hoffer terms it, a ""true believer."" She approaches her work as a real estate agent as if were a religion that will save her from the emptiness she feels in her life. One morning we see her compulsively cleaning a throughly dirty house she wishes to show later that day. She is almost frenzied in her effort, almost losing control at one point, until she cries her mantra, ""Successful people project an aura of success."" But mere capitalism, however decadent, is not to blame here.<br/><br/>American males (and I am not exempting myself in this accusation) appear to be plagued by a fetish about certain female institutions: cheerleaders (because they remind us of our lost youth, Bruce Springstein's ""Glory Days""), and young girls (the Lolita syndrome) for the same reason. Both are subconscious attempts to recapture our lost youth, a time when sex was a mysterious ""potentiality"" and sexuality still a potent, mythical force in our lives. If we wish to verify the truth of the Lolita syndrome, we only have to remind ourselves of the debacle on Long Island a half dozen years ago. The press sensationalized Amy Fisher (Joe Buttafuko's 16-year-old lover) as the ""Long Island Lolita."" She has recently been granted parole and is writing a book about her experiences. Perhaps we shall be seeing this book made into a picture by Hollywood?<br/><br/>In American Beauty, the rose is an ambiguous symbol at best. The more one reflects on the symbol, the more it resonates with meaning upon meaning. Traditionally, in literature, the rose has been a symbol of perfection. In T. S. Eliot we have the rose garden as the ultimate symbol for man's vision of perfection, the ultimate epiphany, and farther back we have Dante's vision of God as a multifoliate rose, a beatific vision of paradise. In the film, we have the rose as sexual metaphor, and not a very subtle one at that. The ""American Beauty"" is a type of rose, of course, the very type that Carolyn cultivates, and the ""American Beauty"" is also the daughter's friend, the object of Lester's lust and his misplaced romantic idealism."
"billymac72","Null","0","0","17 October 2002"," If it weren't for the performances...
","Is it just me or has anyone noticed how similar in tone & structure this film is to Ang Lee's ""The Ice Storm"" from the year before? (which, in my opinion, is a better film) I like ""American Beauty."" It is a quality piece of work, but I've always felt it was completely overrated. The subject matter concerning the alienated, troubled, even psychotic mentality lying beneath the surface, conformist veneer of American suburbia is certainly nothing new to film. ""Ordinary People"" was all about that. Hell, ""Rebel Without a Cause"" is largely about that! So we all now know good & well that everyone who lives in the suburbs are completely unhip to the city, living a life of denial and don't know how to communicate accept in a destructive, passive-aggressive manner that ends in tragedy. Right? Don't tell me ""American Beauty"" is anything new. Filmmakers have hated suburbanites since there were suburbs.<br/><br/>That said, the performances completely redeem my quibbles with the material (there are actually MANY more things I have problems with, but I've long since grown bored with the discussion, as well as these tired plotlines. Now comes the time on Sprockets when we dance!). Lester Burnham is perhaps one of THE great characters ever put on film, and that wouldn't have possible without Kevin Spacey. Thora Birch, apart from being a natural beauty, is mesmerizing in her vulnerable alienation (if you haven't seen her is ""Ghost World,"" seek it out. Her performance was THE best I've seen from last year.). Annette Benning's bitchiness rivals that of Kathleen Turner's in ""War of the Roses"" yet she manages to maintain a certain level of sympathy about her character. Mena Suvari is engaging and likeable in the way she can always be counted on for, even in fairly bad films like ""Loser."" Without a doubt, all of these performances are completely deserving of major praise.<br/><br/>
Sure, there are those of you who will say: just because the subject material is familiar, the entire movie shouldn't be held to fault. After all, wasn't ""High Noon"" or ""The Searchers"" just another western? Wasn't ""Reservoir Dogs"" just another heist flick or ""Jaws"" just another monster movie? In a certain sense, the answer to those questions is yes, but I would also add that each of these films brought something so new and profound to their genres that make you completely forget about the cliches the filmmakers were using. I don't see this with ""American Beauty."" As I watched, the expected happened, as well as the unnecessary. By the end, the audience is bludgeoned with a point already made abundantly and numbingly clear. This, I feel, betrays the brilliance of the performances. Did I mention that I still, nonetheless, like this movie?<br/><br/>7/10"

"dsd2d","10","0","0","29 September 2002"," American Beauty got right what Sirk's films went wrong
","Douglas Sirk is renowned as the key director of the 1950s family melodramas. He saw through the facade of jolly suburbia to the imprisonment of that society.  Mendes, in probably the greatest directorial debut since Orson Welles's Citizen Kane, captured the beauty and dysfunction of suburbia. With Conrad Hall's stylish cinematography which is similar to that of Sirk's Technicolor features and Alan Ball's brilliant script, American Beauty goes much deeper than Sirk ever did.  The brilliance is even more with the balance of drama and black comedy.  Sirk's films had many characters that were so static and unemotional they seemed like motionless statues of particular lifestyles for instance any Rock Hudson role in Sirk's films. Mendes goes further into the characters so the audience at least empathizes with all the characters.  Also instead of only one character saved from societal imprisonment by an outsider, an intruder is helping all the characters in American Beauty.  The 50s might have been the golden age of family melodrama, but it wasn't till 1999 before it got its Citizen Kane."
"lindquistbob","10","0","0","28 September 2002"," A great modern rehash.
","It's been said by many that this film covers nothing new.  As an angered colleague of mine put it ""Who couldn't see the ending from the very beginning?""  However, this doesn't mean that it's impossible for it to be a masterpiece, as a little-known author named WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE did the exact same thing in his classic ""Romeo and Juliet"" with superb results. Thus, we can interpret these opening lines as an allusion attempting to show the viewer that foreknowledge of the plot and a storyline that has been done to death (also like Shakespeare's two star-crossed lovers) can actually be a great thing, because it allows people to be perfectly understood with the plot from the opening lines, thereby removing the need for familiarizing them with it and allowing the performances of the actors (performances that deservedly received Academy Awards) and the brilliance of the dialogue to shine through unhampered by common restraints."

","I am disgusted by the fact that American Beauty has been portrayed as nothing more than a movie about sex. Peoples opinions of this movie are so poor. They do not realize that this movie was not about sex, but about the appreciation of beauty. Did you honestly think that the entire time when the boy who was in love with Lester's daughter was talking about beauty, it was just there as filler? No! This was an intriguing work, about how often human beings mistake their own appreciations of beauty to be something else. The camera angles were stunning, and the music set the mood perfectly. Watching Lester follow his path of self discovery was exciting: you could feel your heart racing as he blackmailed the CEO of his company. At times I laughed histerically, and at others I cried mercillesly. The writing was incredible. I think too many Americans are only interested in sex, and they too make the mistake of equating lust with their own love of beauty. I give this one 10/10 Kevin Spacey is the most brilliant"

","This picture is one of the finest made. Personally, I love films that make you think about your own life, then as the film progresses, it twists your own mind. American Beauty is one of these films. Now, for a film that is an eye-opener, you wouldn't expect so much comedy that just works beautifully. Once you see this film, you will always remember it forever. You will remember it for its stunning perspective on suburban life. You will remember it for its stunning view on family life. You will remember it.<br/><br/>I can't say enough good things about this phenomenal masterpiece. Sam Mendes does a great job of bringing this excellent screenplay to life. The atmosphere that he creates, which is in the lighting, sound, and immersive, trance-like music does me in. To be blunt, this movie rocks.<br/><br/>The acting is superb and deserving of all merit given to it. Kevin Spacey, an actor who I always love, does an unrelenting performance as Lester Burnham, a burned out married disaster. He exudes that feel of lifelessness so well, you would think you're watching one of those hidden camera shows. His narration is spot-on bringing you tension and joy and the story brings you for a ride. Annette Bening is great as usual. You can feel sad and mad at her at the same time. That is remarkable acting. She oozes bitch and sorrow, which just puts you more into the perspective of Lester. The daughter also shows more than the typical teenager, angry for nothing at first, but is slowing realizing life's ending futures. Ricky Fitts is great at showing his undying confidence and the dad shows you where it comes from. All the rest of the supporting cast did a great job as well.<br/><br/>This movie is one for the ages. Keep it in your DVD/Video collection and watch it in any mood. I guarantee you, it will cheer you up."

","I have never seen such an extraordinarily ordinary film in my life. I realise that may not sound too good but believe me, this calibre of film will never be made again.<br/><br/>This is the story of an ordinary man and the mundane and often boring life he leads. Nothing excites him any more. That is until he meets his teenage daughter's best friend. Suddenly he finds himself waking form a dream and he begins to live his life the way he wants instead of just going through the motions.<br/><br/>In the process of fulfilling his own dreams he comes into conflict with his wife and teenage daughter who don't understand his desire to improve his life.<br/><br/>This is a very similar story to James Joyce's epic 'Ulysses' in that it is interested in the very mundanity and ordinariness of peoples' lives. The film often seems bleak and hopeless but its message is ultimately one of hope and perseverance.<br/><br/>The beauty of this film is its very ordinariness. Nothing of huge importance happens, there are no action scenes, no car chases and no real romance but that's what's so good about it. It shows us life as it really is, without pretension or facade and that is what I love about it. Hollywood has so much of a stranglehold that it's hard to find a film about real life these days.<br/><br/>All of the cast was wonderful especially Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham. He plays apathy with great aplomb but his evident loneliness is also touching and heartbreaking. Annette Bening was also wonderful and Thora Birsh (the little girl from 'Hocus Pocus') was great as their angst ridden daughter.<br/><br/>A word of warning for anyone who's into action and adventure, stay away from this, you'll be bored out of your wits and you won't get it. This is a movie for those who like to ponder ideas and the meaning of life."

","This movie is quite dark. I certainly did not enjoy the pedophile angle by Kenvin Spacey who I thought was much better in Seven and The Usual Suspects. In addition, the movie shows nothing new, just recycled ideas from David Lynches Blue Velvet, that all is not what it seems in suburbia.  Who could not see the ending coming from the first line of dialouge in the film?  Not to the mention the weird kid with the camera who likes to film floating garbage bags.  Definitely did not deserve the Oscar for best picture or actor in 99.  Watch the suberb, powerhouse acting of Russel Crowe in The Insider, which I beleive should have won best actor, director and picture in 1999.

The idea of the film is to show you that, people are very good at hiding their true feelings. We the audience are told that Spacey's character is going through a mid-life crisis, yet by the end of the film you feel he is the most sane character there. Superb performance by Spacey and a career best by Mena Suvari as the ""Lolita"" like object of Spacey's desire. Benning is also fantastic, if a little over hammy at times.

"magic_marker","8","0","0","16 August 2002"," Cliche, or true originality? Does it matter?
","All things considered, it is rather astounding that ""American Beauty"" has attained the status it has. The story is hardly original, constructed as it is from every tired stereotype about the middle-class, middle age and middle America; the materialistic, self-destructive wife for whom the American Dream has become a psychotic delusion, mid-life crisis man, who assumes the way to regain his vitality is to flirt with teenage girls, smoke pot and drive a firebird, the borderline pervert kid next door who is really just a passionate misunderstood artist, and rebellious, sulky teenage daughter.<br/><br/>Many scenes are lifted from the bottom of the movie plot stock barrel; the dead man narrating his story from the grave, the wet dream of the girl in the bath (""I was hoping you would join me...""), the suddenly predatory office worker who threatens his boss with exposure, the snarky one-liner upon catching someone in flagrante delicto, etc, etc.<br/><br/>So, how, after all of this, does this film manage to seem so compellingly, wildly original?<br/><br/>The answer, I think, lies not with its story but with its execution. The gorgeous, ethereal cinamatography by Conrad Hall, the wonderful precussive score by Thomas Newman, the wildly orginal editing, and above all the stunning performances by its top-calibre cast.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey is brilliant here, creating a character that is both believable and yet incredibly charismatic. As his wife, Annette Bening finally redeems herself for every performance she's given since ""The Grifters."" Her portrayal of a hysterical corrupted soul is both terrifying and sympathetic. Thora Birch seems ready to take the mantle from Martha Plympton and Christina Ricci as cinema's pet crucible of female adolescent angst.<br/><br/>The beauty of ""American Beauty"" is that it manages to turn a stale and reheated story into a meditation on the nature of life and death. That in a way is a far more profound achievement than turning a discarded plastic bag into a symbol of the purity of nature."

","I just saw this movie for the first time last night and I can't stop thinking about it. It is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen and I think it has an extremely important message which is hidden by the denial of people in society and the shamelessness of the people in Hollywood (see my trailer comment at the end). The trailer did not interest me and I dismissed the movie as another piece of hollywood crap, but after seeing the movie I'm speechless.<br/><br/>I've recently made a lot of drastic changes in my life and it seems like this film was exactly what I needed to see at this time. I think it has had a profound impact on my life in a time when I'm questioning almost everything in my life from friends, to family, to career. I think it is an accurate portrayal of the dark underbelly of a society of posers and people in denial of who they are, what life is about and what it has to offer.<br/><br/>I think one of the main reasons I loved this film is that I can definitely relate to many of the characters including Ricky (artistic and observational), his father (in denial of his sexuality and projects his anger at his family), Lester's daughter (sees her parents' breakdowns first hand), and Mena Suvari's character (totally fake personality, need to feel unique). The film does an excellent job of exposing the reality behind many people's false exteriors and presents us with another view on life and how a person can change they're life....if they're willing to.<br/><br/>I have to give this movie a 10. I was busy in the middle of college when this movie came out, so I don't remember what awards/ nominations this movie or its actors got, but I think it'd be one of the greatest snubs if it didn't win a lot of awards. I'm an artist and I can say that even though the trailer led me to believe that the ""American Beauty"" was Mena Suvari, the true American Beauty is revealed with the brutal honesty of this film.<br/><br/>The people who focus on the so called ""negative"" aspects of this movie (Lester's lust, murder, death, etc.) completely missed the message delivered in this film and I feel sorry for anyone who cannot relate/understand it."

","American Beauty is an Oscar-winning account of a man's mid-life crisis and the hell he puts his family through while experiencing it. I will say that this movie is well acted and the cast was good. However the story line was extremely dark and sleazy. Kevin Spacy plays Lester Burnham, a middle aged man with a wife (Annette Benning) and daughter (Thora Birch). Lester starts to realize his life isn't how he would like it to be and starts to raise hell about it. He deserved an Oscar because his portrayel of this easily hateable character, makes you just want to reach into the screen and punch him. Despite the superb acting,  *SPOILER AHEAD* all the sexual content, inuendo's, drug content, and language, takes away from the film. There are some comical parts, however, I find alot of the subject matter to be extremely distasteful and inappropriate. I understand that the movie is supposed to be that way, but I find it to be distracting. The almost-sex scene with Spacy and Mena Suvari was unnecessary and so was Thora Birch's nude scene. If you don't mind a very R-rated movie, this is the movie for you. Again, some parts are funny and the acting is great, but I wouldn't reccommend it to those of you who aren't into all that stuff."

","**SPOILERS** I saw American Beauty shortly after it was released and I can still remember most every scene. That doesn't happen very often with a movie.<br/><br/>The motifs in American Beauty are intelligent -- tight roses when the frigid Carolyn Burnham is in a scene, loose petals when lascivious Angela (an ""angel"" who comes to liberate Lester) is in a scene. (A rose is a vaginal symbol.)<br/><br/>The most important clip in the movie is when Lester is flashing through the highlights of his life and for a split second, his wife is caught in her youth on a amusement ride -- a free spirit. It is the woman he craves and who does not exist any more, save for in the character of Angela.<br/><br/>Lester has no possessions in his own house. He is a visitor there. The only thing that belongs to him in the house is his weight set. He lives in the garage. He is just passing through. It's true of a lot of us guys.<br/><br/>
There are strong religious themes in the movie. It is redemptive. Lester is delivered from sin. When he dies a few minutes after being tempted by the forbidden fruit, for the first time in his life his soul is clear. He is ready to be welcomed into the Kingdom of God.<br/><br/>On judgment day, it is pouring rain. Lester opens his garage door and confronts the devil. Lester welcomes and tries to comfort the devil without realizing to whom he speaks (but the audience knows). This scene is similar to one of the best movie scenes of all time in The Seventh Seal when the Crusader is in the confessional and unknowingly reveals his strategy to Death. What Lester says to Col. Fitts in his garage is benign on its face and yet is threatening enough to cost him his life.<br/><br/>Nothing is as it seems. Everything is misinterpreted. Redemptive, yes, depressing, no.<br/><br/>Sorry spoilers, American Beauty is still worthy of a 10 on IMDB's scale. Despite your low rankings, it should still be in the top 10 of all time, certainly ranking far above Raiders of the Lost Ark (16) and others that occupy spots above its current rank of 21."

It made me open my eyes and look at the world in a new way, it made me appreciate things that I had taken for granted, made me appreciate every day that I am alive, and made me appreciate my family. I'm not saying I was a sad pathetic guy in need of a morale boost. In fact I was a normal guy. Normal job, normal house, normal family. Its that kind of person that will appreciate this movie the most. the normal person. Because it will make you realise one very special and uplifting thing. You're not normal, you're special. Guess what? So is everyone else.<br/><br/>Everyone is different, everyone is unique, everyone has the potential to be the happiest or most depressed person they can be, and it is all up to that one person.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey takes us on that journey through Lester Burnham. In this epic tale, we see him become that normal person into someone that realises that he is special, and if the world doesn't appreciate that, then screw it. Its a marvel to behold the transformation, and you cant help but be pulled in by the amazing script, intially off-putting but then embracing imagery and visual style and untilmately tragic ending. It is almost magic. Movies should do this to its audience. Movies are meant to be thrill rides that you use to waste 2 hours away. Its not meant to change the person.<br/><br/>This one did, because it knew it was special, and that can be a very powerful thing."

","I'll keep this short. This is a fairly smart, well performed and constructed movie. It has soul, it has character. But it isn't quite the special flick I expected it to be. I enjoyed it wholeheartedly, but I do feel it's one of the many movies which, while very, very good, aren't *quite* the masterpieces critics say they are. Gladiator and Lord of the Rings (This one is a close call) spring to mind.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend it, but it maybe seems to not be as good as perhaps it thinks it is."

","American Beauty deserves pretty much all the awards it garnered, especially the award for Kevin Spacey!<br/><br/>The film itself, for me, is disturbing yet in a weird way comical. Dark comedy, if you must. The cinematography is also terrific. It depicts the mood of the characters so well. All in all, this is a very good movie. With lessons learned too, to live life at the fullest, because the only time you might realize how important life is is when it's too late.<br/><br/>But the ending got me depressed.

","It's been a few years since I've seen American Beauty now, and I've seen a lot of movies in that time span (it's what happens when you work in a video store).  This is still my favorite.  It's not a style of movie that everyone can enjoy and is largely a love it/hate it film.  But it's got amazing acting in a well-written script that includes not only a great deal of humor, but a depth that is almost unheard of in movies.  With the numerous layers incorporated in the film, you can spend days thinking about this movie, and there's still no beating the feeling that comes to you during the final words. 10/10"
"trinitycm","7","0","0","19 July 2002"," overly praised film saturated with symbolism
","The visually stunning debut film of director Sam Mendes came in a year when films looked like they were produced off the back of a Hollywood truck.  In the midst of all the awful films, American Beauty, a good film, seemed to be the savior both of Dreamworks and Hollywood.  I think this was why the film received so much attention...simply because all the other films released were terrible.  But next to the likes of Michael Mann's ""The Insider"" and Norman Jewison's ""The Hurricane,"" American Beauty's cast of anti-heroes falls short.<br/><br/>Alright, enough about me complaining, now I'll say why.  Mendes and Conrad Hall (cinematographer) seemed to have an infatuation with the color red and its ties to passion-hatred-and just about every emotion associated with the heated color.  But instead of letting this hue subtly infect the audience and the film as well, they seemd to use it as a bat; hitting the audience over the head with its symbolism and screaming, ""IT'S SYMBOLIC! DO YOU GET IT! IT'S SYMBOLIC!""  This relentless pelting removed me from the film and made me angry with it because I was not allowed to view the film on my own terms.  I was told where and when to look at certain things (I will remain vague so that I will not reveal any plot to those who still wish to view the movie) and then told what to think about them.  My other problem with the film is the antihero.  A useful tool in films like Nolan's ""Memento"" and Aldrich's ""Kiss Me Deadly,"" the antihero is supposed to be an average person who does some bad things to try to do good and manages to draw sympathy from the audience.  However, because of all the truly awful deeds committed by the characters in American Beauty, I had no sympathy for any of them. **************Spoilers coming...you have the jist of my feelings...do NOT read of you don't want spoilers******************* When Kevin Spacey's character, Lester Burnahm, ends up dead I did not care.  I wanted him dead because he was sexually obsessed with a young teen.  And his wife cheats on him, so when she feels miserable, I dont feel for her either.  Every character has some major flaw like this:  whore, drug-dealer, raging depressive, homophobe.  Because I could not connect to any character and simply did not care what happened to them on top of being told what to think about nearly every scene, I refuse to praise this film as everyone else does.<br/><br/>One more quick note:  I must say that this is still a good film.  It is not a great film.<br/><br/>I would also recommend:<br/><br/>Road to Perdition (a much better collaboration with Mendes and Hall); Muholland Drive;  Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain;  Forrest Gump"

"jmorrison-2","Null","0","0","17 July 2002"," If you pay attention, this movie has much to say
","I wasn't sure quite what to expect when I sat down to watch this. It seems, at first, to be a kind of screwball, suburban comedy. It was actually the third time watching it that a lightbulb kind of went off. All of a sudden, I got it! This is a very, very good movie with a very unique way of making it's points. <br/><br/>We seem to go through our lives all wrapped up in the garbage of modern life; the over-commercialization of virtualy everything, the constant race to capture what we think we want, what we think we need to be happy. We forget all about the things that used to make us feel joy, the things that used to just make us feel good inside. This movie, to me, was almost like driving home from work after a bad day, and stumbling on a radio station playing a song from your adolescence; a song that you hadn't heard in 20-30 years, and had completely forgotten about. You hear the song, and you suddenly remember the way it used to make you feel, the crush you had on the girl in your class, the sights and sounds that used to make you feel everything was alright with the world. We grow up and forget all about those things, and we get completely caught up in all the things that are supposed to equate to happiness in the grown-up world: money, status, more and better ""things"". We suddenly find ourselves in middle age thoroughly depressed, and utterly unhappy with where we are, what we're doing, and how we got there. Part of what this movie is about is the story of a man who reaches to find that person he used to be; to rediscover the things that used to make him feel good, to feel alive, to feel like a man. That the movie ends tragically is almost beside the point. He had finally found it, and now finally understood. <br/><br/>This is a fascinating movie to watch, and there is alot more here to interpret than you can see on the surface. A superb acting job by everybody involved, especially Kevin Spacey."
"VivienLeighsnumber1fan","Null","0","0","9 July 2002"," One of the Best Films of 1999.
","The first time I saw the now famous poster for American Beauty was months before it opened. I was going down the escalator of a posh local multiplex, and there it was at the end of my descent. I looked at those red roses adorning an actresses midsection, and I remarked to a friend that this looked like a very special movie. I don't what it was about the artwork that made me say that, but it turned out to be an accurate remark. The movie opened in a limited engagement in September 1999 and went on to build and build. In March, it won Oscars in major categories - Best Picture, Best Actor [Kevin Spacey] and Best Director. At the time, there were some nay-sayers who said the film painted too dark a picture of American life. I won't debate this, but I will say that there are precedents in the Academy Awards. For example, Billy Wilder's The Apartment, a scathing comedy about how morally low some people will go to move up in corporate life, won Best Picture in 1961. Brilliant is brilliant, no matter what the subject is, and America has had a seriously cynical side to it for decades.<br/><br/>Welcome to the Burnham household. Meet Lester and Carolyn [Spacey and Annette Bening] and their lovely teenage daughter, Jane [Thora Birch]. The Burnhams have it all - the lucrative jobs, the topflight public schools, the perfect suburban home, the immaculate lawn with its borders of American beauty roses. What could possibly be missing from their lives? Oh, just little things like happiness and fulfillment. Lester and Carolyn certainly no longer love each other. Theirs is an uneasy truce. On the surface, Jane comes across as a snide and ungrateful child, but you have to ask yourself who wouldn't be eager to leave such a dismal scene? How often many of us point the finger at our children when what we are showing them are lives devoid of love, passion, honestly and integrity.<br/><br/>Jane is a cheerleader at the local high school, and one night the Burnhams decide to attend a game. They want to show support for their daughter, who truly doesn't want them there. Lester sees another cheerleader, a friend of Jane's, and instantly falls in lust. He becomes obsessed with the girl. He quits his job and blackmails his boss into giving him $60,000 severance pay. He buys a red Pontiac Firebird. Carolyn, who constantly berates herself for not being a success, retaliates by starting an affair with an arch rival in the real estate business. Their actions are not exactly what they appear to be. Lester's pursuit isn't all about an older man / young girl relationships. Its about the loss of youth and passion and about the dire consequences that can be spawned by living a whole lifetime of fitting in. Carolyn feels she has totally lost controlnot just of Lester and Jane, but of life as a whole. I think they are after the same answers, only Lester uses a brutally honest approach. And now Jane is really ready to split.<br/><br/>
Compounding all these problems is the arrival of some strange new neighbors. Col. Frank Fitts is a retired Marine who's feelings are so repressed he's become a walking time bomb. His wife has retreated into a haunting, silent world of her own. Teenage son Ricky is obsessed with videotaping everything he encounters, including Jane. He supports his hobby by dealing vast quantities of dope. Soon Jane and Ricky have a thing going, and everything climaxes for all involved in one bizarre night of the most memorable and improabable miscommunications. <br/><br/>Is this a comedy or a drama? That's hard to say. Many viewers do not relate to the Burnhams specific problems, but they do identify with their general feelings. In laughing at them, many of us are laughing at ourselves. Take the problem of trying too hard to fit in. There is nothing wrong with doing this, unless you lose your own identity in the process. And many would agree that, while there is nothing fundamentally wrong with being American, there is currently something fundamentally wrong with American life. Personally, I think it has less to do with moral issues than it does with a basic spiritual emptiness that comes with being obsessed with external appearances and with material goods. <br/><br/>American Beauty is a brilliant movie and, to me, probably was the best American film of 1999. Like a few others before it, it stands uniquely on its own, owing very little to movies that came before it. I love the way it peels away the layers of the Burnhams' lives like onions. I admire its essentially nonjudgmental point of view. Best of all, I like the way that everyone is somehow redeemed at the end. Its a movie that makes you wish there were a few more great ones like it out there."
"perni","Null","0","0","7 July 2002"," Odd, twisted, sick, and oddly fascinating
","This is the first 'real' movie I'm reviewing. All of my other writings on this site have been for MST3K B-movies or animated films. American Beauty, however, was Oscar-nominated and heralded by many critics, so I take this task a little more seriously. Like I said, this is one dark and twisted film. The whole pacakage, from the wife smacking herself in moments of hysteria to the husband who fantasizes about a high school senior, is about as weird as you can get. But if you prefer something with a little more edge in your movies, this is perfect. Every single character is worth a second look, and both the opening and closing monologues are classic (I'm going to use the opener for a theatrical audition, if that tells you anything). There are also some good comedic moments that are both sly and funny, though you may catch yourself holding back the chuckle. Again, this is some fuzzed up shoot, if I may take a note from the Superstation channel. Red is a major color in this film, from the bold roses to the door on the main character's house. I am not quite sure what its meaning is, but you can be sure I'll find out. This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I certainly enjoyed the experience. Oh, and check out that ending! You knew what was going to happen from the first minute of watching, but still...4 out of 4 stars."

This movie proves why Kevin Spacey is one of the best actors up to date, and personally my favorite. I'm still amazed in the fact that Wes Bentley didn't atleast get an Academy award nomination for his brilliant performance as Ricky Fitts, the strange ,but beautiful, boy next door.

","Even more amazing as you realize that there is no particular tight structure holding the various strands of the story together. The only unifying idea is the lack of one and an invitation to total freedom of interpretation. Yet in spite of this the you have the feeling that you are witnessing an impecable performance which is at all times perfectly kept in hand and perfectly symmetrical.  A film of no restrictions-in subjects it dwells on and people it allows itself and the audience to love-a cannabis dealer, a sometimes pitiful middle aged balding man searching his path; no moral judgment is passed, no condemnation uttered. American Beauty is a film about beauty-and nothing you see through its transforming camera lens can be anything but beautiful. Sam Mendez is at his best using a full blown arsenal of theatrical devices; often you can imagine any of his characters standing on a stage; there is theatrical care for placement of the characters in the set and the sound track oscillating between 70s tracks and the haunting instrumental motif composed by Thomas Newman gives it unforgettable atmosphere. Total freedom, art at its best; it will stay with you through every look you take again at the world. My all time favorite."

"DahManDatWuzzinDare","10","0","0","15 June 2002"," A masterpiece of longings, deep-seated emotional complexes and lost innocence
","A masterpiece of longings, deep-seated emotional complexes and lost innocence, American Beauty is one of the finest films I've seen in a long, long time.  Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey give excellent, award-winning performances as Lester and Carolyn Burnham, a frustrated middle-aged couple living in suburbia.  Their lives are mundane and they spend their time searching for redemption and happiness in their otherwise dismal lives. Their daughter Jane is a depressed teenager with a poor self-image and is described as a `regular teenager' in the screenplay.  Thora Birch gives the finest acting of her brief career, displaying many complexities to a layered role.<br/><br/>The tragedy of Carolyn and Lester is that they can't find true happiness and they get emotionally attached to the wrong people.  In the beginning of the film, Lester becomes obsessed with Jane's best friend Angela (Mena Suvari) and undergoes a physical transformation so as to appeal to her.  By the end of the film he's accomplished his goal but before he has sex with her he sees her innocence and the guilt consumes him.  He can't do it because he finally see's himself as a middle-aged man and her as little girl, reviving those lost feelings of paternalism. Lester has many aspects, but this is by far the most engaging facet of the character.  He doesn't want to let go of his youth so he goes into denial about his life.  When he lays his eyes on Angela for the first time he becomes a teenager again, and is insecure.  At the same time his whole life has undergone a transformation because he's began to act like a teenager, without a care in the world.  Fantasizing about lost temptations.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey gives the finest performance in the role he was literally born to play (the role of Lester Burnham was supposedly written exclusively for Spacey.)  While he has received critical acclaim for his work in Se7en and The Usual Suspects, Kevin Spacey proves that he lives up to the title of the decade's greatest performer.  He exhibits a bizarre stillness, and says more in his facial expressions than any actor can in mere words.<br/><br/>Carolyn is completely withdrawn from Lester sexually and emotionally. Their relationship is a tapestry.  After Carolyn has an affair with real estate agent Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) and is discovered by Lester, she has an emotional breakdown (which occurs several times in the film) and is convinced by a motivation tape that she should kill him.  But of course when she discovers that he's dead, she symbolically falls forward into Lester's clothing, hysterically crying.  She didn't know what she had until he was gone.  She realizes that she really loved him and her desire to kill him was only a manifestation of her own self-loathing and guilt.<br/><br/>The tagline, `Look Closer,' may be an overstatement as the film's psychologically-charged sub-plot is far more interesting than the mere aspect of pushing the envelope and `breaking down walls.' Films like Happiness and The Ice Storm were successful in looking far closer than American Beauty has, but this film is a perfectly constructed masterpiece. Every shot pulsates with raw emotion.  The lush colors and desolate landscapes supplied by veteran cinematographer Conrad L. Hall are exceptional.  Hall won an Oscar for his brilliant use of light textures and emotionally draining photography, his second after his work on the all-time classic Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid.<br/><br/>Although this is his first film, Sam Mendes is a directional visionary. Each shot perfectly exhibits the feelings and emotion with a lot of emphasis on facial expressions and subtle movements.  He perfectly choreographs every scene, texturing them with subliminal motifs.  Mendes is big on stillness and is a master-blocker.  The icing on the cake is the darkly sparse score.  Like most great films, the music changes to adapt to the feeling of the sequence, and motifs are used to foreshadow events to come.  Mendes' motifs are some of strangest the cinema has ever produced. The color red is used to predict tragedies about to occur (e.g. the roses from his fantasy sequences with Angela; Lester's dream car) and the illusion of prison bars (which were originally connected with the film's original ending, in which Jane's boyfriend, next-door neighbor Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) is wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of Lester) are also ever present.  The Fitts family supplies another interesting sub-plot.  Ricky's father Frank (Chris Cooper) is a latently homosexual former colonel and Allison Janney delivers a brilliant performance as his shell-shocked plate-holding housewife.<br/><br/>What makes American Beauty a true enigma of modern film, is the complete and utter desolation of the setting.  It's creepy without containing creepy people.  The characters are normal people.  The `Look Closer' element comes in when we realize how painful these peoples lives are.  Where as Happiness and The Ice Storm paints a portrait of delinquents and pedophiles with no closure in life, American Beauty depicts the self-loathing skeletons in the closet, and their redemption.  The normal, day-to-day soap opera of mundanity that is modern living."

"Rub-a-Chicken","Null","0","0","9 June 2002"," An Important Movie: You Will Love it or Hate it
","SPOILERS, SO BEWARE ======================> American Beauty is an incredible journey into the psyche of normal middle-class suburban Americans. Each character portrayed in this film appears to have a normal life, but as we soon discover each character is dysfunctional in their own way, with their own point of view on the society in which they live, and their accepted moral values. It is a social comment on the contemporary state of suburban America. This film dares to explore many important, and vastly complex modern issues.<br/><br/>Firstly, it explores the inter-personal relationships between husband and wife, parent and child, schoolyard social interaction, and the employer / employee relationship. The main characters clash with each other constantly as they meet common situations with vastly different points of view. Lester Burnham clashes with his wife Carolyn constantly on issues of capitalism, and the portrayal of her shallow self image. Carolyn clashes with Lester about his lack of respect for the rules, the law, success, and his self image. Jane (the disturbed teenage daughter) clashes with her father Lester over his lack of attention towards her, the (perceived) lack of love for her, and of course his crush on her beautiful school-friend, Angela Hayes. She perceives that her father loves Angela more than he loves her. Ricky Fitts clashes with his schoolyard collegue Angela, as their different approaches to life make them poles apart. Ricky's past history with the mental hospital only agrovates this situation. Ricky also clashes with his father, Colonel Frank Fitts of the US Marine Corps, who wholeheartedly believes in the discipline that he learnt from the Corps. He is constantly disappointed that his son does not fit his mold, and is deathly afraid of his son's involvement with homosexuals.<br/><br/>Secondly, it deals with homophobia in a very daring way. Colonel Frank Fitz is portrayed as a very conflicted character, deathly fearful of homosexuals, steadfastly opposed to their way of life, and yet displays a great deal of repressed love for his son, which he is unable to convey, and which leads to frustration. There is a telling scene toward the end of the film where the Colonel kisses Lester, which indicates his own repressed homosexual impulses, which may have finally offended his homophobic nature so much that it caused him to crack.<br/><br/>Thirdly, it deals with beauty. Although it is not beauty in the conventional sense, as shown by the fall from grace of the very attractive and beautiful Angela Hayes. As Ricky Fitts points out, under the surface Angela is ordinary. It delves into the unseen beauty that can be found in ordinary everyday things, beauty that is most often overlooked by people who are too busy to slow down and appreciate it. Beauty it seems, can be discovered by delving below the surface, and exploring that which you cannot see with your eyes, but with your mind. It is definately mocking a society driven by surface beauty (glitzy advertising, super-models, luxury cars, and the 'surface image' of success). It mentions discovering beauty in the most unexpected places, and for a brief moment, this is like looking into the eyes of God.<br/><br/>Four, it deals with perception versus reality. Scattered all throughout the film, are examples of perception (or image) being more important than reality. Carolyn and the King have taken this to extremes, with his telling comment, ""In order to be successful, one must portray an image of success at all times"". Carolyn tells Lester to ""act happy tonight"" when they go out to a function. Her obsession with appearance also reaches home, with her Italian silk sofa, her beautiful Mercedes, her beautiful garden, the way her garden shears match her clogs!  Angela Hayes is also afflicted with this modern disease, she is very attractive, and often discusses her willingness to have sex, or use sexual attractiveness to realise her dreams of becoming a model. Again, this is an image that she is projecting (as Lester finds out in the pre-sex scene where he finds out she is really a virgin).<br/><br/>Most importantly, it deals with life, and how to live it. ""Above all else, be true to thyself"". This is the lesson that Lester slowly begins to learn, with the help of Ricky Fitz. He stops believing in the lie, and living the lie that just makes us better consumers. He learns to love again. He learns the meaning of passion, and the persuit of passion (Carolyn pulls up in the driveway to find Lester's new Pontiac Firebird!). He learns to speak his mind when faced with adversity or injustice, and not just roll over and accept his fate (the classic scene where he blackmails his boss, by speaking out about his boss blowing $50,000 on hookers, and the hypocrisy of his being fired). He struggles to deal with his wife, and her capitalistic approach to life - the accumulation of 'things' and 'stuff', as a benchmark of their success. Her devotion to 'Me' centered living, and the surface image or portrayal of success at all costs, even at the expense of (it seems) her own dignity. He begins to lose respect for his wife, as he pulls away from her ideals and returns to his own. The final straw is evident in the discovery of his wife cheating on him with Buddy Kane, the King of Real Estate, in the fast food drive thru. ""You don't get to tell me what to do - ever again!"". This lack of respect is also evident later on, when Colonel Fitts questions him, ""Your wife is out fooling around with another man, and you don't care?"".<br/><br/>There is a lot to learn from this film. If you've only seen it once, do yourself a favour and see it again. It took several watchings for me to truely get the point, and I believe there are still things I have missed. And don't be put off by the disturbing content.<br/><br/>I'm still not entirely sure about the closing statement from the Narrator, but there is an important message here. ""[the beauty...] Try not to hold on to it. Let it go, and it will flow through you like rain, and you will feel nothing but gratitude."" I guess this is a throw-back to Ricky Fitz and his video camera, desperately trying to record and hang onto his moments of true beauty so that he can remember them. Let them go, Ricky ! [10/10]"

","""What we have got here is a failure to communicate!"" That's mainly what I derived from watching this worm's eye view of a ""typical"" (?) moderately affluent neighbourhood. Apart from one household consisting of two homosexual males who seem fairly well adjusted to life, every other one in view is totally dysfunctional. Could that hint at an ""agenda"" on the part of writer or director? The film could be viewed as ""Chekovian"" comedy perhaps, but the eminent Russian's characters while living lives of quiet (mostly) desperation at least maintained some hope for the future. You could say they ""tried"". Or perhaps it is a ""modern film noir"". Certainly, almost all the characters are losers. ""Lester Burnham"" may have ""turned his life around"" as has been said, but if so it was in a direction of almost certain ultimate chaos. Only ""Angela Hayes"", late-teenage girl friend of ""Lester's"" daughter ""Jane"" seems capable of salvaging something from the mess.<br/><br/>One could explore the bleak aspects of the other characters: ""Jane"", totally estranged from her parents in supposedly ""typical"" teenage fashion, wife ""Carolyn"" who just occupies the same house as her husband ""Lester"" without actually ""living"" with him, or ""Col.Frank Fitts, U.S.Marine Corps"", a repressed homosexual whose brutal treatment of his family is graphically displayed, or finally his son, who has ""coped"" with life by becoming a voyeur and very successful drug dealer. Only in this last case are we shown the root causes of these dysfunctions. This is not what I would charaterise as a ""positive"" film.<br/><br/>There are some rewards, though, in spite of the foregoing negative comments, which derive from my personal dislike of films which emphasise the worst aspects of life. The tawdry and sordid, much beloved by William Faulkner who could well have written this script, are not high on my list of preferences. Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening give outstanding performances with many nuances which limn their characters. The rest of the cast seem ""over the top"" to me, but, but what the heck?!. In a film like this, subtlety might go unnoticed."

","SPOILER ALERT---although it was released in 1999, so if you were ever to see it, you SHOULD have watched it by now!<br/><br/>With all movies, you have to suspend some disbelief, but above all accept the movie in it's own terms.<br/><br/>Here, we have a movie that satirizes happy, American suburbia, the corporate world, personal values (a homophobe having homosexual feelings, a teenage model sexing her way to success), enthusiasm (Janie being on the dance team), and society-defined responsibilities (not smoking pot, not having sex with a teenager, and just punching the 9-to-5 clock like a good little adult). Is it successful? In my opinion, yes. Why? A satire can use as many clichés as people say it uses and still be original and funny. I believe the movie succeeded in that.<br/><br/>The film's cinematography is what media production classes in college should use as textbook material.<br/><br/>The acting, from Spacey and Bening to the teens and to the supporting cast, frosted and topped with cherries an already excellent screenplay. Many a movie painfully shows their actors not connecting with the script---nary a line of dialogue, a character nuance, nor a detail of a situation passed by or flew over the heads of this cast.<br/><br/>And, of course, only a theatrical director could bring such brilliant stage vision to the screen. Every scene could have easily been presented in a proscenium-arched stage, a feat sadly not attempted by filmmakers.

","Oh my God!! I have never watched a movie so undeserving of its praise. I'm serious. It isn't the worst movie of all time, but it certainly does not deserve to be #20 on this site, and possibly not even in the top 250. Yes, Kevin Spacey is a brilliant actor, that gets no argument from me. ""The Usual Suspects"" is proof of that alone. But OH MY GOD this movie is overrated. It is not ALL of that. Yes, it's funny, but only sporadically. It's pros are its occasionally funny script, Wes Bentley, Wes Bentley, and, oh yeah, Wes Bentley. Maybe the most interesting character in the movie. Yes, the cinematography is beautiful, and Spacey gives a great if not somewhat overrated performance. But the simple fact is, in a year that produced The Sixth Sense, Fight Club, The Insider, Three Kings, Magnolia, and even The Hurricane, there is no way American Beauty was better than all of those. Thought provoking, yes. Profound? Excuse me while I laugh my ass off. Things are not always what they seem. How many times have we seen that before? Oh, so the pretty girl turned out to be a virgin. Stop the presses! The homophobe is gay? Alert the media! I mean, jeez! The only Oscar this movie deserved is maybe one for cinematography. In five years, it will be forgotten. No psycho will be trying to assassinate George W. Bush in order to win Annette Bening's, Thora Birch's, or Mena Suvari's affection. Best movie of '99? IMO, The Sixth Sense or Magnolia. I do not want to make snobby generalizations, but if you love this movie and call either ""The Godfather"", ""Goodfellas"", or ""Raging Bull"" overrated, then you need serious psychiatric attention because those movies effortlessly deificate on this PASSING FAD!!"

","""American Beauty"" has got to be one of the most poignant, incredible films of our time. Not only was it wonderfully directed, acted, and produced-it made sound points about the way we live-and what's wrong with it. Some complain that it has no plot. That's because our lives have no plots. How many people do you know whose entire world gravitates around one conflict or event? That's what I thought.<br/><br/>The homophobic dad was a classic example of gay hate being rooted in a personal insecurity that one is, in fact, gay. Jane's dad conveyed that many of us are just wasting away our lives behind desks and computers when we'd rather be ""jerking off in the shower."" Jane's mom shows how so many wives these days are totally repudiated by their husbands and that infidelity is not always the eighth deadly sin. Jane herself was the typical morbid teenager full of angst, but quite believable. Ricky was proof that sometimes the most sagacoius people you'll meet with be on drugs or voyeauristic and you'd never guess they were so beautiful if you didn't form a connection with them. Angela proves the same thing, with her ditsy manneurisms and brazen attitude about her sex life. I can't divulge the ending, but I will say this: This movie revitalized my zeal for life. Few movies make me cry, and this was one of them."

"Nimrod-14","Null","0","0","17 May 2002"," A taut dissection of the soft underbelly of American life.
","SPOILERS! American Beauty is not a literal story.  It is an allegory and, I believe, a powerful one.  It is a taut dissection of American life, mores and the ascendance of appearance and `spin' over what is real.  The film is set in `Anytown', America; people's lives are apparently neat and well ordered. Look at the interior shots, just about every one shows an almost unreal tidiness.  The film then scratches the surface and gradually reveals the disorder and hypocrisy hidden behind the layers of veneer.<br/><br/>The film deals with appearance verses reality; The marriage that is a sham, the nympho who is a virgin, the drug dealer, Ricky, who fakes his drug test, the `liaison' between the Lester and Ricky that is not what it seems, the homophobe who is in fact homosexual.  The distinction is cleverly blurred further, with the dream sequences and Lester's desire for the girl that, once he has the opportunity to fulfil, he realises that this was fantasy.<br/><br/>It is no coincidence that Lester sells advertising space: advertising deals is generating perceptions that are generally not in total accordance with reality.  Even when Lester is fired what is important is that he can use a lie, of a sexual advance, to secure better terms; it doesn't matter what happened it is what he can get people to believe that is important.<br/><br/>Remember what the real estate salesman says; to be successful first you must appear successful; appearance before reality.  Angela wants to become a model, this is the height of her ambition, she wants to have breast enhancement surgery to improve her chances, she is obsessed by how she looks both physically and, by bragging about her sexual experiences, socially. She is transfixed by her appearance because that is what society expects.<br/><br/>How a sofa looks, and what it cost is seen by Carolyn as more important than the opportunity to redeem her marriage when, fuelled by beer, Lester makes an advance.   She has failed to achieve success; with her job and her husband; her daughter is a disappointment.  She seeks solace in an affair with a successful (in a small town way) man; the `King of Real Estate'.  If you cannot be successful then get close to someone who is.<br/><br/>Colonel Fitts is the archetypal hard-bitten military disciplinarian who rails against homosexuals, as we find out, the image that he projects to the world is a sham.<br/><br/>After he is fired, Lester tries to recapture his lost youth (innocence) a simpler time, and in some sense, he is redeemed.  Lester begins to care less about appearances and starts to live as he wants, symbolised by the new car and the change in music at dinner.  He has become a man with nothing to lose and happier than before.<br/><br/>The sanest people are in fact the ones that live outside the constraints of society; the drug dealer, who makes a living from enabling his clients, who are `respectable citizens', to escape reality and the daughter, Jane, who wants to live as a `freak'.   Ricky is the character, who, as the film's tag line says, takes a closer look.  He becomes Lester's personal hero by not conforming.<br/><br/>The film puts under the microscope America's obsession with success, money and appearance; the conclusion is that these obsessions are vacuous and corrupting."
"cmramsey30","Null","0","0","11 May 2002"," American Beauty's Suburbia
","In the opening minutes of the film American Beauty, there is a close-up shot of a red, vibrant rose.  No sooner has the viewer had enough time to appreciate the rose, when a pair of clippers comes into the frame and snips off the flower.  It is in this scene that the voice of Lester Burnham introduces the viewers to his wife Carolyn. He dryly remarks, `That's my wife Carolyn. See the way the handle on those pruning shears matches her gardening clogs?  That's not an accident.' American Beauty's writer Alan Ball and director Sam Mendes waste no time placing us into the world of upper middle class, suburban America. The neighborhood is uniformly pristine: white picket fences, lush green lawns, and sport utility vehicles parked in driveways. We have been placed in a world similar to the one inhabited by the Cleavers, the Nelsons, and the Bradys. This is the American ideal that Eisenhower introduced, Ronald Reagan promised and Bill Clinton delivered. This is the world that Lester Burnham yearns to escape.  For all its uniformity, normalcy and security, the suburban landscape is littered with dysfunction, infidelity and boredom.<br/><br/>In his review of the American Beauty screenplay, Peter N. Chumo writes, `The main narrative thread of the script is Lester's regeneration, which is sparked by one of his daughter's classmates, Angela Hayes, the archetypal American dream girl' with whom he is immediately smitten when he sees her performing in a cheerleader routine. While Lester obviously lusts after Angela and has vibrant, literally rose-tinted dreams about her, she becomes more than a sexual fantasy. She reawakens in Lester a zest for life that the years have knocked out of him.'  Lester's feelings for Angela are completely inappropriate. But unlike Professor Humbert Humbert in Kubrick's adaptation of Lolita,  Lester's lust is born out of his sexual frustration with his career-obsessed wife,  who refuses to have anything to do with him sexually. When his wife catches him masturbating, she is disgusted by his behavior and questions the validity of their marriage. Lester responds,  `This hasn't been a marriage for years. But you were happy as long as I kept my mouth shut. Well, guess what?  I've changed. And the new me whacks off when he feels horny, because you're obviously not going to help me out in that department.' Lester's re-awakening is more a return to his youth. A return to a time when he didn't have responsibilities and the future seemed full of opportunities. His transformation is signaled by his use of marijuana and his desire to become more attractive to Angela by becoming physically fit.<br/><br/>The darker message that lies underneath American Beauty's comic tone can be unveiled simply by adhering to the film's tag line `look closer'. A closer inspection into the Burnham household would reveal that although it appears they have achieved the American dream, in fact, they are steeped in dysfunction; as are their neighbors, Col. Fitts, his shut-down wife, Barbara, and voyeur son, Ricky. American Beauty moves beyond being a story about Lester's mid life crisis and becomes a story about self-examination. This message of looking closer and digging deeper is expressed best by Ricky Fitts when he describes the day he videotaped a plastic bag floating in the breeze, `That's the day I realized that there was this entire life behind things, and this incredible benevolent force that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid. Ever.' American Beauty in many ways shares many of the same dark qualities as David Lynch's Blue Velvet.  Lynch stripped away at the façade of suburbia to reveal a sinister evil. Lynch began his film with his camera gently moving down a very normal neighborhood street featuring white picket fences, lush green lawns and friendly neighbors. The camera slowly sinks into one of the many green lawns and tunnels its way deep into the dirt, where beetles can be seen swarming under the surface.<br/><br/>Another masterful theme that American Beauty portrays is real beauty by forcing us to re-examine all the things we hold dear: sex, career, home, cars, guns, happiness and death. In the opening sequence of the film Lester's voice tells us that he is dead. But, he is very much at peace with his after-life and by telling us the story of his last year on earth we too will have a similar peace. This is It's A Wonderful Life in reverse. Lester doesn't get Clarence the Angel to save him; only death will give him the distance to appreciate true beauty. Lester says:  `I guess I could be pretty p***ed off about what happened to me but it's hard to stay mad, when there is so much beauty in the world.'  Through death, Lester escapes the conformity, vanity and daily drudgery of suburbia.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Alan Ball wrote that his inspiration for American Beauty came from the Amy Fisher case. The Amy Fisher story is a tale of lust and attempted murder in middle-class suburbia. Ball wrote,  `The media circus had begun, and the story was swiftly being reduced to its most lurid elements, with a cast of cardboard stock characters acting on their basest impulses. But underneath it all were real human lives that had gone horribly astray...'<br/><br/>American Beauty's director, Sam Mendes, wrote this description of the film,  `It was a kaleidoscopic journey through American suburbia, and a hugely visually articulate one at that. It was a series of love stories. It was about imprisonment in the cages we all make for ourselves and our hoped-for escape.' American Beauty won Oscars for best film, best original screenplay, best actor and best cinematography at the nineteen ninety-nine Academy Awards.  Without question, it struck a nerve in this country. It gave us a darkly comic tragedy about the price attached to materialism as a way of life.  Like the tag line says `look closer' and real beauty will show itself."

","Thank you to Alan Ball for his writing genius and to Sam Mendes for taking it upon himself to direct this movie.  Kudos to both!<br/><br/>And thank you to Debra Zane for finding the perfect cast! <br/><br/>
What an insightful look into modern American suburbia.  There is an essence of this film that is unmistakably dark, but it also creates an atmosphere of understanding.  It almost seems a personification of a ""Walter Mitty"" wet dream.  What I appreciate most about the film is the fact that there is nothing hidden, nothing for the camera to miss.  The very fact is that no one's life is edited, and what we see on the outside, is rarely what is going on inside!  <br/><br/>The true gem in this film is the writing, and the simple photographic art - anything too risque would have ruined the illusion of simple life. <br/><br/>

But at least her dad isn't complex and cruel as her nieghbour/boyfriend Ricky's dad, Frank.  Lester has something of a crush on Jane's friend, Angela.

Lusting after a teenage girl and smoking weed are not my way of being joyful, but that's not really what the movie is about; it's about finding beauty in your life and enjoying it for what it is.

","What more can be said about this excellent film. Unlike a lot of Oscar winners in recent memory, this movie actually deserved every Oscar it won. It is a riveting portrait of American life in the suburbs. Probably there are few families quite as dysfunctional as this one but I bet almost all families can relate in a small way to the Burnhams.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening play the Burnhams, a middle aged couple who are going through their mid-life crises. Spacey is working for a magazine trying to sell advertising spots and Bening is a somewhat successful real estate agent. They are stuck in a loveless marriage and while Spacey's mid-life crisis revolves mostly around his physical appearance and sexual prowess, Bening is hungry for success and feels that she is a failure. They also have a teenage daughter who thinks her parents are crazy and has basically withdrawn from any type of relationship with them.<br/><br/>There are so many things happenning in this film that it would be hard to explore all of them at once. Spacey's character becomes infatuated with his daughter's best friend, the daughter developes a relationship with the ""psycho"" boy-next-door and Bening's character carries on a love/hate relationship with the town's truly successful Real Estate King.<br/><br/>
What's most interesting though is that about half of the movie is way over the top while the other half is quite suttle. And it is the suttle parts that are the most interesting. The parts where you need to ""look closer"" as the tagline suggests. There are not a lot of answers here but there is a lot of food for thought and American Beauty is the kind of movie you are still thinking about days later.<br/><br/>With that said, there is one scene in the movie that seems totally out of place. It is one of the last scenes, so I can not fully describe it but it really felt out of place in this film. The scene involves Spacey and his next door neighbor. Other parts of the film were understated and they worked really well. For example, we don't really know what is wrong with Ricky's mother but she is barely conscious and her memory is shot. We do not know whether her condition is caused by being beaten or by some sort of degenerative disease but Ricky is obviously scared of ending up the same way. So when we see the hundreds of videotapes in Ricky's room and he gives the speech about beauty and never wanting to forget, we can understand the motivation for his behavior. This final scene however clashes with the style and pacing of the movie. <br/><br/>I was impressed by the acting, the story, the style of the movie and everything else. This movie is truly a must see. If it were not for that one little scene, this movie would be a perfect 10. As it is, I had to give it a 9/10 although I would have given it a 9.5 or even 9.75 if the system allowed for it."

","Now, several months after I first saw ""American Beauty"" is prompted to thinking about it again, not so much by the Oscar hoopla, but rather by a comment made recently by esteemed screenwriter William Goldman, during an interview on Charlie Rose - he said that the only real difference between ""The Ice Storm"" and ""American Beauty"" is that the latter is a financial hit, while the former was not.<br/><br/>What is the element that seperates these two, essentially similar films, equally well-made films, that accounts for the disparity at the Box-Office? Mr. Goldman would say simply that people wanted to see ""American Beauty"" and did not want to see ""The Ice Storm"" - though (and he knows this) it goes a little deeper than that.<br/><br/>Both are keen studies of suburban inertia, the key difference is that ""The Ice Storm"" is a hermetically sealed one, it does not seek to engage the audience in a way that ""American Beauty"" does, it is a tightly focussed character study.  ""American Beauty"" engages us from the get go, with the ""Sunset Boulevard""-esque voice over delivered right to us.  More precisely than that, ""American Beauty"" speaks to something universal in all of us - we ALL believe that we see beauty in a place that no one else does, it alone is OUR beauty, because we have taken the time to look closer.<br/><br/>(When I told this to a friend he pointed out that it had nothing to do with the above point, but that people would rather see Mena Suvari seducing Kevin Spacey, than Christina Ricci seducing little boys in bathrooms)."

I think what they are trying to say is that although everyone has major problems in their lives, there is still so much beauty in this universe all around us.

"Arkaan","10","0","0","1 April 2000"," An absolutely incredible experience
","American Beauty was recently re-released in my town after having a shamefully short run.  I had seen it the first time, without hearing any of the hype, and thought it was a stunning achievement.  After seeing it again, I still think it's a stunning achievement.  Is it the best film of 1999? Yes, there is no doubt in my mind.  Magnolia is the only one that comes close (in my mind) to it's power.  <br/><br/>  A lot of people have been comparing to Happiness and The Ice Storm.  I liked Happiness, but not The Ice Storm.  However, American Beauty tries to be neither.  Though it is similar to The Ice Storm, the characters in American Beauty were human, unlike the ice figurines found in The Ice Storm. Happiness was far more ambitious than American Beauty, but focused on the mordant characters.  This film tries to find real beauty, and that is it's strength.<br/><br/>  The performances from the actors are truly magnificent.  Kevin Spacey deserved his Oscar, and gave edge to some brilliant lines.  The power he gave to this line ""You don't get to tell me what to do.  Ever.  Again"" could have taken oil off a potato chip.  This is his finest role (and performance) to date.  Annette Benning is also great, but the supporting actors deserved more mention than they received.  Wes Bentley gave a powerful performance as Ricky Fitts, and I would have loved to see him get an Oscar nomination. Thora Birch and Mena Suvari were also excellent.  They each had scenes that they handled incredibly well (Suvari's final scene with Spacey, Birch's fight with her father).<br/><br/>  Alan Balls' screenplay was written exceptionally well.  The emotion and power he gives his characters brings them to life on the screen.  Conrad L. Hall's photography was majestic and awe inspiring.  Thomas Newman's score was perfect, as was the editing.  <br/><br/>  I can't believe this is Sam Mendes first film.  He directs with skill and talent (though you can tell he was a theater director) and brings together the performances, script, and technical details to make one the finest film of 1999, weaving tragedy, satire, and irony to make a truly touching movie. <br/><br/>
  To compare this film to the Oscar pageantry of The Cider House Rules would be ridiculous. A lot of people will say that American Beauty was overhyped, and maybe it was.  But consider this: American Beauty is not an Oscar film (Spacey pleasuring himself in the shower, vs cute little orphans), but it has the audacity, originality, and brilliance to shine a light at American suburbia in late 90's."

"ross.francis","Null","0","0","31 March 2000"," A Phony Film
","In the words of Holden Caulfield, this film is phony.<br/><br/>American Beauty is a Hollywood film, so it comes as no surprise that the film is full of cliches and under-written characters. What is surprising is the hype surrounding this film. It simply doesn't live up to expectations.<br/><br/>How exactly is the film tragic or comedic (actually, it's supposed to be both)? Lester may be a pathetic figure but he is not tragic. After all, he can (he tells us) do whatever he wants. Where is the tragedy in that? His death, of which we are informed just seconds into the film, is not tragic because he tells us at the beginning that he feels dead already. So where's the tragedy when his death finally arrives? Furthermore, where's the comedy? Are we supposed to laugh when he quits his job and starts doing drugs? Stupid maybe, but definitely not funny.<br/><br/>And what is the function of the plastic bag swirling in the wind? This scene is supposed to represent beauty. Maybe it is beautiful - who am I to say? - but how does it relate to who the characters are and where they are trying to go? I think the plastic bag is intended to divert viewers' attention away from the shortcomings of the film. We are supposed to think ""what beauty, how exquisite"", not how this image has no relationship with any of the characters. Presumably the roses are used for the same reason. The roses are beautiful, therefore the film must be beautiful. Wrong. The film is beautiful only if the roses are integral to the plot, not just a stylistic device. Unfortunately a stylistic device is all they are. Unless, of course, the roses represent Angela's innocence. But surely the film's makers wouldn't resort to using such a trite metaphor?<br/><br/>When I think of colour used for effect, I think of Kryzstof Kiewloski. But ironically his films are known for their substance more than their style. In 'Bleu"", in which Julie's husband and children die early on in the film, the viewer is drawn into trying to understand what Julie is thinking and feeling. We know what an awful situation she is in. How would we react in the same situation? How does she react? She doesn't react in the way she would if she were in a Hollywood film.<br/><br/>American Beauty is nothing like ""Bleu"". In American Beauty, the characters are sketchy; we don't really know what motivates them to do what they do. We don't know what they feel (we don't even know if they are able to feel). They are like robots, who are programmed to behave in a way that someone wants them to behave. They don't have minds of their own. I am beginning to think that many of those who rave about this film have the same flaw."
"The Truth","8","0","0","31 March 2000"," Good, but overrated.
","American Beauty is a well-written and enjoyable film, but it's strange how most of it's major flaws seem to have escaped the critics' attention. Because the film has gathered so much appraisal, I'd like to comment on it's drawbacks.<br/><br/>First of all, American Beauty's way of treating it's themes is somewhat over-emphasizing and clichéed. I agree with James Berardinelli that the voiceover is completely unnecessary. This is not a children's tale, so we don't need to hear the moral when the story ends. It's far better if we figure it out ourselves. Also, the character played by Wes Bentley (the teenage boy next door) is used in a way which is very typical of American films. He's the wise outsider who sees through everyone and knows everything (see Magnolia for better use of this cliché), and when he says things like ""there's so much beauty in the world I can't take it"" or ""you're not really beautiful, you're ugly"" he very much serves the same purpose as the voiceover: to tell the less intelligent viewer what's going on in this film.<br/><br/>Secondly, although the actors do excellent work most of time, they do tend overact; this most evident in the scenes between Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening. This exaggeration is clearly deliberate and though it works most of the time, some scenes just seem to be fishing for cheap laughs.<br/><br/>I might have liked American Beauty more, had I not seen two recent films with similar concepts: Todd Solondz' Happiness (1998) and Ang Lee's The Ice Storm (1997). Happiness deals with the same themes as American Beauty (the pursuit of happiness amongst middle-aged, middle-class people), but is more insightful and far more daring. The Ice Storm, on the other hand, has a surprisingly similar structure to American Beauty(the two neighboring suburban families, and the relationships between the adults and the teenagers), but it's approach to the subject matter is more subtle and less preachy. For these reasons, both Happiness and The Ice Storm deserve four stars (out of four) and American Beauty only three."

","We have food, homes, toys, activities to keep us busy and yet some of us come to see that this is all meaningless, that to be really satisfied with what we have and what we do, we have to be who we really are.  That is the message of American Beauty.  It's a theme that has been explored before in film, sometimes beautifully (The Graduate, Grand Canyon), but nobody has done it better than Mendes in American Beauty. Through the eyes of an adult, it explores what it means to be a person--an adult man numbed by a cocoon of empty comfort, a teenage girl struggling in the depths of estrogen poisoning, a woman who has relinquished the joy of life that she had when she was first falling in love and tries to fill it by selling more houses.<br/><br/>American Beauty is a grand, multilayered, nuanced symphony without even one false note.  Every detail felt true, both the ""real"" ones (the pretty,full-breasted teenager who feels so ugly that wants to have breast enlargement, the exquisite Nazi platter in the collection of a repressed, retired Marine colonel, the condescending downsizing expert that Management installs to increase the bottom line) or the more symbolic ones (the god-like view of the suburb where the action takes place, viewing the world through a digital videocamera, the recurring and fascinating use of red rose petals).<br/><br/>Fascinating movie, and profound, with the message that we can transcend the system we have unwittingly created for ourselves and find out and become who we are.  It can be the catalytic event of saying ""I quit.""  It can be having a 1970 red Firebird, the car we lusted after but could have only dreamed of when we were kids.  Or it can be having the longstanding object of our lust in the most vulnerable possible position and backing off, showing compassion rather than taking what seemed so desirable and easy.<br/><br/>At its core, this is a simple plot: a man caught in a box escapes it.  But how he comes to his senses, what he sees along the way, and the profound sense of fulfillment upon escaping makes this poignantly funny, darkly comedic tragedy a triumphant affirmation of life.  Spacey, who was very good before, is absolutely brilliant, his subtle expressions telling volumes about his trials and transformations.  If there is any justice, he'll get the Oscar for Best Actor.  Bening is superb, having the courage to eschew the charismatic charm of her role in The American President to take on and ace the least attractive role of her career (even less than the one in Valmont).<br/><br/>There's even a question that remains unanswered to make us think long after the powerful, emotionally layered denouement: was the seductive nymphette lying about her many sexual conquests or about her virginity?<br/><br/>Either way, and for the sophisticated yet life-affirming message, the plotting, the cinematography, the acting and the direction, American Beauty elbows its way into my already crowded 10 Best Movies List."

","American Beauty as the title is a play on Annette Bening's character Carolyn who obsessess about her roses which are ""American Beauty Roses"", a type of rose. Notice that all through the film there are vases stuffed with these roses and that the color red and the rose petals of Lester's lustful fantasies destroy the ""flower-ness"" of the American Beauty roses.  Also remember that the theater poster says ""look closer"".  Deflowering means destroying innocence.  Take a lit class, pal."

","An excellent example of the emancipation of the north american male in today's society.<br/><br/>Emotionally beating up on men is not only tolerated but actually accepted in today's society, as demonstrated by Lester's wife and daughter.<br/><br/>Lester decides to rid himself of his shackles placed on him by society's expectation of ""shut up and do your job.""<br/><br/>Via his meeting the teenage boy next door (whom Lester calls his personal hero), Lester learns the lesson of being responsible to himself.<br/><br/>To quote Milton, ""Better to rule in hell, than serve in heaven.""

","I've seen A LOT of movies in my 16 years.I'm an all around film buff, I pretty much live on movies. American Beauty stands out in my mind though- we can, I think, all relate to it in some respect.  I think your very close-minded and downright naive if you refuse to like this movie because of its subject matter.  Adultery, substance abuse,lusting after a teenage girl-sure, it's a bit harsh and a bit on the extreme side, but compared to most other movies, this is PRETTY damn mild.Watch the news once in awhile folks!  I just hate all this whining, ""Oh no! He's selling weed!"" or the always classic, ""What a depressing movie, blah blah blah"" Depressing? Is that your excuse? Well, if a movie depresses you that much, you need more help than the characters do.  You people just need to read the fine print. American Beauty's message of not taking your life for granted will stand the test of time no matter what.  If you fail to realize that because of some harsh subject matter that you can't seem to swallow, then well, that's your loss.  For those who loved the movie, I don't know about you but, Lester Burnham will have a place in my heart forever."

","Without a doubt, this movie is a masterpiece and gives the audience a blisteringly honest look into the life of two ordinary families in 1999.<br/><br/>The first family is the Burnhams. Kevin Spacey (Oscar winner for his touching performance) is Lester, a sexually frustrated man who is looked upon as an idiot by his wife, Carolyn (Oscar nominee Annette Bening) and daughter, Jane (Thora Birch). He's just simply misunderstood. The spark has long been out of the marriage and they just tolerate one another.<br/><br/>The second family are the Fitts. Chris Cooper is the father, Frank, a military colonel, who abuses his son Ricky (Wes Bentley) and makes him take a urine test every six months to ensure that he's not on drugs. Allison Janney is the mother, Barbara, who seems to be emotionally neglected and is often seen as very sullen and distracted.<br/><br/>These two families intertwine when Ricky and Jane begin dating which leads to a shocking climax.<br/><br/>There's also a subplot involving Lester, who develops a crush on Angela (Mena Suvari), Jane's friend. The infatuation isn't disgusting, just showing a man who has finally met his dream girl.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very honest and engaging film that received five Oscars, including Best Picture."

Rarely in my life has a movie affected me in the way that this movie did.

"abneunie","Null","0","0","27 March 2000"," Have I Missed Something?
","Fresh from the Oscars could someone please explain why American beauty has been voted the top 2 film of all time because 2 weeks after seeing it at the cinema, I feel I've missed the point. This film is supposed to be a portyal of American surbubia. Well if that's the case and is supposed to be a true reflection, then the only conclusion I can make is that America is one f****d up society. I would be furious if I was a surbubian American watching this movie.<br/><br/>I would find it offensive and full of stereotypes, yet by reading some of the other user comments, it seems that the yanks are the ones who are giving this film the most praise. You have a middle aged man who is fantasising about having sex with his daughters best friend, a SCHOOLGIRL. I mean how immoral and perverted is THAT. Lester should have known better. I found his fascination and sex scene with Mena Survari not only sick and upsetting but very disturbing. I'm sure some mothers at the cinema who have young teenage daughters were livid. The fact that he was suckered by a teenagers silly provocation just proves how perverted Lester is. I mean this girl knows absolutely nothing about love or sex yet Lester took blatant advantage of her. Was I the only person to notice this??? Fantasy is one thing, but trying to have sex with a schoolgirl is another. How an earth can he, (the writers, director and the studio) justify this, allowing this whole infactuation to take place. Would they like a middle aged suburbian man to try it on with their 16 year old daughter? I think not. It takes me back to a quote said (ironically) by Satan, in the Devils Advocate,""Look but Don't touch"", ""Touch But Don't Taste"", ""Taste but don't swallow"" and when it comes to middle aged men and schoolgirls, I think this is sound advice<br/><br/>I could identify more with the ex-marine (Colonel Fitts) than Lester (at least he had an excuse. What was Lesters?). Honestly, is this what Americans like to see. Middle aged men fantasising about schoolgirls. This is the stuff peodophiles are made of. That aside I thought American Beauty was pretty good but no way near as good as to vote it the top 2 movie of all time. Better than THREE KINGS?????!!!! It had good direction by Sam Mendes and cinematography, but Kevin Spacey as best actor??? He has a boring monotone voice with no variation whatsoever. He sounds like Fox Mulder. He was the same in the Usual Suspects AND the Negotiator and he rarely manages a smile. Annette Benning (although annoying) showed far more variety and effort in her performance. At least you can tell she was acting (I can't with Spacey). Spacey's performance was nothing special and the fact that he won best actor just confirms how insignificant the OSCARS really are. I don't need to see Russell Crowe or Denzel Washington with a gold statue in their hand to know that their respective performances in the Insider and the Hurricaine were FAR  better than Spaceys. I even thought Michael Clarke Duncan put in a better performance in the Green Mile than Spacey in American Beauty. In fact, i don't think Spacey was acting at all. Its as if he had come to work without his suit He was almost like a Robot, uninterested and without a care in the world. The best performances were by the Kids, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) and Thora Birch. I liked Ricky's charachter.<br/><br/>Overall American Beauty is a pretty average film, but full of cliches and stereotypes. Middle aged man going through a crisis, unhappy wife, unhappy daughter, sexually fustrated wife, weird neighbours, dopeheads, wife and kid don't appreciate me, kid embarrassed by me (what teenager isn't embarrassed by their parents), best friend thinks she's miss world, i'm a teenage girl who thinks I'm fat and ugly blah blah blah blah blah. Really, are all Americans like this? I mean we've heard it all before. We didn't need a film to highlight what goes on in peoples minds evey day, not just in the US, but in the UK too.<br/><br/>
The fact that AMERICAN BEAUTY won best picture, best actor and best writer (anyone can write about their family and their neigbours and it would be on a par with this movie) not only proves how stupid and overated the oscars are, but how immoral (and racist), they are aswell. (When was the last time a DESERVED Black or Asian actor or actress won an oscar?. Why didn't M.Night Shymalam win for best screenplay? Remember, this film is an 18 certificate (when was the last time an 18 won best picture. It is an 18 for a reason), and most of these academey members have wives and kids, yet they voted a man who's charachter nearly molests a schoolgirl, as the best performance of the year? It says alot about the Academy. Think about it.<br/><br/>If you want to be entertained and appreciate a far better movie with better direction and cinematography, then then go and see Three Kings."

In this respect, the film has a complete tone of<br/><br/>irony throughout.<br/><br/>Spacey is a suburban Thoreau who leads the search for freedom from the quiet desperation of people trapped in<br/><br/>the ordinary.

","#2 movie of all-time on this database?  That's a bit hard to swallow.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie is quite good.  But it is also quite flawed. The central message of this movie seems to be that one need not be afraid of anything.  There's also some overtones to suggest that irresponsibility can be more than an amusing tangential for a middle-aged man, but that it can be a reasonable goal for this person.  Lester is portrayed as a hero for blackmailing his boss, threatening his wife, ignoring his daughter, smoking dope, and generally fighting back against his feelings of powerlessness.  Yes, it's great to fight back against a feeling of powerlessness, but Lester's solution rings false.  The answer to the problems of adult life is not to behave like a 16-year old, up to and including the job at the local burger joint.<br/><br/>The movie could have been interesting had Lester been forced to get his way out of the messes he was developing.  But instead, he's just killed off.  (This is no spoiler, you learn this in the first minute of the film.)<br/><br/>This might sound moralistic, but that's not really my intention. Lester has problems and he's not dealing with them at all. He's regressing.  The really interesting movie would be how he adjusted himself to fit back into society."

","...odds are, he would have either made something like ""American Beauty"", or been one of the numerous people who have seen it over and over again.<br/><br/> American Beauty is the wonderfully uplifting tail of the destruction of a man's life, and the deterioration of his family -  and no, I'm actually not being sarcastic.  One day, when mild mannered and hapless Lester Burnham realizes the travesty his life is, you can hear something snap in his head at dinner with his family.  He breaks down his daily routine, and asks himself why he hasn't killed himself yet.<br/><br/>And the answer is, he decides he has nothing too lose, and therefore, has too much to live for.  He can do whatever he wants, without a care in the world, risk free, because no one he hurts really cares about him.  His actions effect others, and he honestly has no real reason to care.  His flaky wife finally admits to herself she left him emotionally, and his daughter is shaken up when Lester develops a huge crush on her flirty cheerleader best friend. The Hitchcockian elements of the film are Lester's reasons, his actions, and their effects.  In such a simple setting with simple characters, the wierdest things happen to show the beautiful simplicity that is life, and only Lester and his neighbors abuse Son realize this, nobody else ever catching on.  <br/><br/>While it may seem that the film is fraught with depression and unbearable tension, the truth is that it is, but that is one of its many beauties. Going insane proves to be the only way to stay sane in the world, and Lester enjoys every minute of it, as does the viewer.  We watch as he happily destroys the false holds everyone around him holds dear too, and can only hold onto Lester's wild ride.  A dark, comic, beautiful ride that doesn't make us, but helps us realize the beauty beneath God's world. <br/><br/>

There is a tenderness to this film which makes its black satire intensely involving -- not the cheap bleakness and cynicism of Tarantino and his equally sophomoric imitators.  The characters in this film, even at their worst (and they do behave badly), are fully human and demand compassion even while making us sick with contempt or when they're just plain pathetic.<br/><br/>The cinematography was effective and innovative, especially the scenes-within-scenes (on Bentley's TV/digital video monitor), to give us both detail, gentle irony and multiple perspectives.<br/><br/>In a plot with several plausible endings, it was gratifying to be unsure of the precise outcome because, as in real life, so many possibilities existed and were developed.  Spacey can act -- he doesn't have to give us a ham-fisted monologue for us to know his thoughts and feelings.  What a moment of grace for his character Lester when he hears ""It's my first time"", and how convincing and understated is his awakening from the tunnel vision of his obsession to the humble truths, his and hers.  <br/><br/>I would predict Oscars (certainly there will be nominations) for this film for Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Actress in a Leading Role, and Best Supporting Actor,  as well as, perhaps, best screenplay and Best Actress in a Supporting Role, except I know the voters for the Academy Awards are mostly village idiots who collect Star Wars trinkets for intellectual stimulation and rarely see half the films they vote on anyway, but that's another matter, eh?<br/><br/>Recommended without reservation -- ""10 out of 10"", first film over an ""8"" this year for me."

I can not understand why so many people are jumping a ""bandwagon"" for this film calling it the best ever and perfect. This film is no where near the best film ever nor is it perfect. American Beauty has not even been out for a year and you people think it is the best ever and a classic. I don't know about other people, but to me classic means that the film has withstood a test of time and has been looked upon as a fundamental film over the years. This movie has yet to withstand any time. Don't be so quick to say it's the best ever. In my opinion far from it. Another thing that annoys me is how it can be #2 on the top 250 or how any 1999 film can be in the top 10. Where did this come from? I don't see how you can rank this or any 1999 film ahead of such films as 2001, Raging Bull, Casablanca, Chinatown, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane etc. I'm rather disappointed to see how the majority of the public views movies. 8 movies from 1999 in the top 50? give me a break. the only film from 1999 worthy of top 50 may be American Beauty, but I'm still not sure.

","This is perhaps the greatest film I have seen for a very long time. OK, maybe it would appeal to a 39 year-old divorced man who had a similar epiphany in his life but it also appeals because it deals with fundamental philosophical issues. One comment on the database maintains that it is not beautiful because it is not moral. This seems to me to be a most simplistic and superficial assessment. The whole point of the film is a questioning of the wisdom of accepted norms and morals. It asks us in a very Nietzschean way what it is we do with our lives and how we really want to live them. The point of it being narrated by a dead man is that he has to look at his life and ask himself whether he would do it all again. The final look on his face before he dies not only justfies an oscar for Kevin Spacey as best actor but shows that after going full circle and living in despair he returns to his family and sees it as the beautiful thing it is. In that sense it is a hghly moral fim which should not upset any of the Christian moralists out there (perhaps that is the only bad point of the film) but arrives at that conclusion after only through a process of self discovery. As Nietzsche said, you have to become what you are. Being is therefore both process and state. Lester Burnham goes through the process and the end result is both shocking and beautiful. This film is a masterpiece."
"Firas","8","0","0","21 March 2000"," It is a surprisingly good movie about our social masks, loneliness and inability to see the beauty in the world
","Usually the more a movie gets Oscar nomination or prizes the more I don't want to see it. Generally it was one of my rules in the pre-evaluation of movies and it is based upon many bad experiences. In the case of ""American Beauty"" this rule was not applicable at all. I got encouraged to watch the movie after I heard so many contradictory opinions about it Usually when a lot of debates are aroused about something it is worth seeing. It is in fact a movie among a serious of excellent low budget socially critical American movies that are made in the last three years like ""Happiness (1998)"" and ""Sue (1997)"". At the beginning it has the amazing ability if making you laugh on things that are principally very sad. The main characters are 'usual' people but after taking a deep look along the movie you find out that they are not usual at all! Everybody is behaving normally in  way the society wants it but they are deeply ruining their lives. It is a critic about their loneliness and inability to communicate with each other. It is also about the image that one should have in the surrounding society ignoring ones real feelings and running after the material world leaving his 'human' self behind. A middle aged man is fed up with his stupid work and the his boring life and falls in love in the friend of his teenager daughter. His wife is running after her own career forgetting the many things that make people happy in their lives without thinking about money. His daughter is feeling neglected by her parents. Her best girl friend  personifies the 'American beauty' with her long blond hair and excessive make up and keeps on telling about her big sexual adventures and how a great model she will be. She is surely also of course totally dumb! A neighbor, who is an ex-officer in the Marines, runs his home with military order. His son makes his money illegally in order to afford buying expensive video equipment in order to document everything around him. The impact of this film comes from the similarity between this people and all of us. Are we also so unhappy? Unlike the end of ""Happiness (1998)"" and although it is principally sad, it's very optimist! The photography is simple but effective. Using the video camera in some scenes helps contemplating these scenes with other eyes. I am still astonished of the great success of this movie. Usually such critical movies don't encounter the enthusiasm of the spectators especially the North Americans. Is it a new tendency in Hollywood to make movies with a deep meaning? Or at least with some meaning?!"

Here was a man who truly desiered to get his boring, lackluster life to be what he wanted it to be.<br/><br/>I have gone through and read the many of the comments that others have written and I would just like to say that I disagree on one point. There are those who have said that this is a movie purly for adults, or more enjoyed by males, well I am a sixteen year old female and I don't think that age or sex has anything to do with the heartfelt poignancy of this movie.<br/><br/>

I don't think there is anything that I or anyone else can say to properly do justice to this masterpiece of art.

Well let me tell you something.  I have lived a mere 17 years on this Earth and I have seen a lot things.  Many of which put the shocking behavior many have commented about in this film to shame.  I've seen things, heard things, done things that would make many sick to their stomachs.  And the truth is I'm bound to see and hear and do a lot more in life.  I'm a normal, middle-class, Suburban teen.  Still just like the movie much of my life same as anyone elses that I've encountered is just a commercial.  ""The truth is stranger than fiction.""  And.  ""Fiction has to make sense, the truth doesn't.""  Are two little phrases that come much to mind when I watched this movie and read many reviews.<br/><br/>Okay maybe that wasn't short.  Still, my point is this.  American Beauty is very real blurring the lines between fact and fiction like no movie, no anything ever has done before.  While still remaining an art form with many deep and true messages for those willing to open their minds and accept them.  Who the hell said that the movies or TV couldn't teach you anything? Noone.

","American Beauty is a movie about a dysfunctional suburban American family.

So, the story evolves around these two main events, plus some interesting subplots which you need to see to appreciate.

","Thud.<br/><br/>Thud.<br/><br/>Thud.<br/><br/>This is the sound of the heavy hand I heard emanating from the screen as I watched American Beauty.  The characterizations are so broad and cliched as to be almost cartoonish.  These characters are -- the whole movie is -- about as deep as the paint on my walls.  (Less so, in fact: I used two coats.)  Like the city of its origin, it's a gaudy board covering a deep hole, platitude ornately expressed.  It's bumper-sticker philosophy.<br/><br/>Is it fun and sometimes very funny to watch Kevin Spacey make war with (the filmmakers' idea of) convention?  Sure.  It's also painfully adolescent.  It gives an out to pent-up angst.  But Lester Burnham's carpe-diem catharsis is the worst kind; it's not bravery to act the way he does in his release, it's bravado.<br/><br/>How much of a epiphany can it be when it's not enough to spur him to regret and apologize for his shameful behavior?  He's been just as guilty as any of the other guilty parties in the film of being blind to the implications of mortality, yet when his eyes are opened, he doesn't seek to expand on that understanding.  He doesn't use it for anything other than an excuse to become self-indulgent.  That's not courageous, that's selfish.  I'm supposed to admire him for this?  I'm supposed to admire a guy for not having sex with a minor?  This is how low our standards have dropped?  Frightening. Good for Lester for seeing the light, but shame on him for not learning anything truly worthwhile from it.  The same admonition applies to the filmmakers.<br/><br/>Basically this is yet another movie that espouses the idea that personal happiness is more important than moral behavior, which is why American Beauty is so popular.  People are more concerned with how they feel than how they act.  They'd rather be happy than moral.  It's easier.  Definitely American, but it ain't beautiful."

Some folks just didn't see the movie I saw (nor I the one they saw, evidently).<br/><br/>The film is nuanced and careful; it is at the same time a dark comedy, a murder mystery, an obsidian-sharp dissection of modern American mores, and an exploration of the nature of beauty.  It succeeds in being all of these things, although maybe less at the last of them than at the others.<br/><br/>Being a parent of a twenty-one-year-old daughter and the quondam stepparent of four stepdaughters who are all older, I have a R/L base to use in evaluating the two girls' performances, and must say that they are directly on target.  There are other kinds of teenagers than those two, but both portraits are accurate and clear.  The girls are used both to illustrate the effects of suburban life in the USA on ordinary people (this film puts one, indeed, in mind of the film of that name), and to show the vapidity of the adults' lives and souls.  Not a new device to be sure, but well executed here.  The ""psycho"" young man, who is probably the most sane character in the movie (again, not a new concept, but done to a ""T""), serves as the primary source of exegesis and plot development; his camcorder is the leitmotiv which illustrates life's burdens, benefits, and absurdities, while allowing him and his development to act as a counterpoint to and illuminator of the slow awakening of the main character.  The kids are thus both very well portrayed and superbly used organizationally by the director and writer.<br/><br/>The central couple, Carolyn and Lester, are stellar.  Lester has led a lackluster life, as he thoroughly realizes, and his sudden infatuation with his daughter's purportedly promiscuous friend awakens him to the need to do something about his situation.  His frenetic, perfervid wife, devoting herself to the kind of empty Babbittry that is so common in the States today (I have known people *exactly* like her, and the commentators who feel that Bening is over the mark obviously don't know the mark she's targeting), shows with crystalline clarity how easily we can lose humanity for superficiality (again, not a new tale, but one always worth telling), and acts as the perfect foil for her husband's slow development of understanding and self-awareness.<br/><br/>The ending is no surprise (after all, we're told in virtually the movie's first line that the protagonist dies), but the how-and-whodunnint aspects are not totally predictable until, maybe, five to ten minutes before the end; it's well done.  And by the end everybody but ""Col. Mustard"" (now, there's a spoiler, I guess) has developed into pretty much a good guy of some sort -- or at least an ordinary human being.<br/><br/>Now, that's not too shabby, is it?<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this, do."

Everything comes to a head by the end of the picture when we found out how Lester dies and how the other characters are involved.<br/><br/>Alan Ball has crafted a thorough and surprising screenplay, well deserving of its Golden Globe.  Ball is not afraid to flirt with copping a legend as Lester provides narration from beyond the grave a la ""Sunset Boulevard,"" nor is he afraid to be edgy and subversive as Ricky, a self-acknowledged drug dealer,  provides the theme of the film.  Beneath everything lies beauty. We see this beauty in Lester's transformation, of course.  Every character, however, is allowed a shred of vulnerable beauty.  Bening brings a human despair to Carolyn, especially when we see she is just as unfulfilled as Lester.  Suvari's slut brings forth an insecurity that is palpable and empathetic.  No one is one-dimensional, which is an amazing achievement for a film that could have very easily slipped into surface satire.<br/><br/>The credit must go to the cast and director Sam Mendes, Golden Globe winner for best drector.  Mendes has worked prior to the film with theatrical productions of ""Cabaret"" and ""The Blue Room"" with Nicole Kidman's acclaimed performance.  Mendes' theater-upbringing is evident as he allows for the characters to be three-dimensional.  Burnham's lusting after Angela could very well have been distasteful and crude.  But Spacey imbues him with such awkwardness that it is not unlike a nerd's crush with Miss Popular.  His immature behavior is a nice humorous touch, but eventually this deepens into something poignant and bittersweet.  Lester Burnham may be as archetypal a film character of the millennium as Benjamin Braddock was for the 20th Century.<br/><br/>This also bodes well for directors as Mendes' arrival may herald forth a theater/film renaissance on par with Elia Kazan and Mike Nichols in the 1950s and '60s.  In fact this is already holding true as Julie Taymor, who directed Broadway's ""The Lion King,"" is making a film version of Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus.  Not to say that this is filmed play. Mendes proves to be a visual poet with evocative use of fantasy sequences involving lots of rose petals, and the counterpoint of suburbia at its drabbest.<br/><br/>But look closer...for as ""American Beauty"" teaches us in its epiphanal finale, nothing is without beauty and grace if one is willing to look for it.<br/><br/>American Beauty ****"

","Well, according to the posters, the tag line for this film is/was ""look closer..."" Unfortunately, this film makes it's ""meaning"" so obvious that you really don't need to. Everything is clearly laid out, and any confusion is swept away by Lester's closing monologue which approaches cliche (""you don't know what I'm talking about... but you will""). This film really isn't as ""deep"" as everyone says it is. The themes dealt with are standard ones (overwork, materialism, teen agnst, etc.) and are unfortunately rather stereotyped. That said, I must admit that I really enjoyed the cinematography/acting/etc. This film is definately worth seeing, but does not, by any means, deserve the honor of ""Best Film Ever""."

","I'm so glad that they re-released American Beauty in the theaters. I missed it the first time around and since all my friends loved it, felt I needed to go see it on the big screen. I knew about the Oscar nominations and felt that it would really have to deliver to impress me and live up to the hype. When it was over...I was in such a state of awe that I could barely move!<br/><br/>   This movie is possibly one of the greatest of all time. I've seen great movies (Citizen Kane, the Graduate, Taxi Driver, Clockwork Orange, Silence of the Lambs, etc.) and this movie definitely ranks up with the big boys. First of all, the acting was superb. Kevin Spacey is brilliant and we see some of the insanity in his character that we saw in SEVEN. Annette Benning is easy to hate but at the same time you feel so sorry for her. Every actor in this movie delivered. The cinematography was wonderful as well. It had a ""film-noir"" look at times. I loved the rose petals and the other symbolism.<br/><br/>   With that said, this was an unbelievably well written movie. There were so many twists and turns. You were on the edge of you seat even though we all knew the main character was going to die because he told us so in the first minute of the film. Having a dead character as the narrator is quite original as well. I loved this movie more and more as it went on. Almost every character is despicable but yet it is easy to sympathize with each. Even the horrible marine officer neighbor is a truly woeful character.<br/><br/>   This movie is so great because it is not the typical movie. It does not have a happy ending nor any truly happy moments. It carries a resounding message that things are not as they seem and people suffer. Yet at the same time it shows that beauty can shine through ugliness. I was speechless after this movie! Go see it on the big screen while you have the chance! It deserves all the numerous Oscars that it's nominated for!!! A masterpiece!"

","I saw American Beauty the other day and thought this was the best movie of the year. The performances of Spacey and Wesley were outstanding; perhaps Wesley like Carrey was robbed for not being norminated. Benning performance can either be seen as over-acting or someone who is trying to make a false face for herself and a makeshift image of success. Nevertheless, after seeing Richard Farnsworth performance in 'The Straight Story' I realised that Richard deserved the oscar if it was just a race between him, Spacey and Crowe. Whereas, Spacey relied upon good camera direction and words to convey emotions, Richard went a step better just by seeing his slow movement across the screen - he didn't even have to talk to convey ideas and emotions and when he did Richard as Alvin summed up World War Two far better than three hours of 'Saving Private Ryan' could ever do. For me this is the best movie I have seen since La Vita e Bella and that was over a year ago!!! This is one of the greatest movies of all time for the following reasons: 1) The acting by all the characters were outstanding, something you cannot claim for American Beauty. 2) The storyline was more thought-provoking as it's the type you will appreciate more when you are adult enough to understand. 3) There are moral lessons here that are far superior to American Beauty.

The first (like me) thought it was funny..but not worth the hype. The second hated it saying it was perverted and sick...I was told that half the people left the cinema while seeing this movie. And the third absolutly loved it and overhyped it, so ruining everyone elses perseptons of it.<br/><br/>
Yes it is a good movie but it is not worth the overall 9/10 rating.<br/><br/>
It was spoilt by the beginning where we are told the main character will die (I don't see this as a spoiler because it is the first thing you hear when you see it) which in my opinion ruins the ending. I think the ending would have been more shocking if it was not anticipated.<br/><br/>The blonde teenager was overly sterotyped...I absolutly HATE the ""sterotyped teenspeak"" and the plastic bag thing was boring..BUT served a brilliant symbolic purpose. I laughed for all the wrong reasons in this film, I see it as a black comedy, and thankfully there were no really gratuatis sex scenes in it, however it is cringe-worthy through out the film as we see (among other things) the fathers disgusting fantasies about his daughters friend.<br/><br/>
All in all a good way to spend your afternoon, but I would only give it an 8/10. I am the type of person to rate movies based mainly  on how entertaining it was. However, just because *I* rated it that does not mean the whole board should give it such a high rating. I know is sounds silly, but when you compare other films of a much greater calibre which are given lower rating it seems such a shame. Overall the board should have given it a 7 or an 8.<br/><br/><..>"

","I waited a long time to see this as nothing I heard about the film seemed interesting. Now, I am glad I waited and went to the less expensive matinee.<br/><br/>I am left feeling that America has an awfully short memory. There is nothing in this film that hasn't been done, story-wise, before. A lot of the themes seemed to be left over from an earlier age. Vacuous teens and the pathetic lives of the materialistic middle-class were done to death in the sixties and seventies, with better sex too. I had hoped to see something more original but I guess a lot of very young movie goers will never see all the old films so this is their introduction to some very tired, overworked old themes. That left me wondering out loud what all the hoopla has been about, so I tried to find something redeeming here.<br/><br/>The director did a good job with the material he had. Not too hard to stand above that script. (music, costumes and sets were mundane, nothing striking, but well executed for the setting.)<br/><br/>The acting was the one saving grace. Spacey and Benning played characters I have known. They gave realism to the pathos. Their portrayals with the material they were handed was excellent. The real standouts (because of their newness) were the younger actors and actresses (ladies, there is nothing wrong with being female).<br/><br/>Wes Bently showed real talent in his restrained portrayal of the edgy - otherwise stereotypical - young rebel. He saved what could have been a joke.<br/><br/>There has been a lot of talk about Mena Suvari in this film. She was OK, but nothing to live up to all the hype, foul mouth notwithstanding. (Note: I am fully aware that hoards of young girls now talk like this character. It is not cute or funny, it's kind of pathetic, which was the point I suppose.)<br/><br/>The real shining talent here was Thora Birch as Jane. She managed to breath what little life there was into this film while managing to look much better than Suvari doing it; no mean feat. She is stunning in both talent and beauty and there is a great future for this fine young talent, as well as the others.<br/><br/>Chris Cooper's portrayal was true to the script, I am sure, but it left me with ""Huge Hollywood Stereotype"" running through my mind. His acting was excellent, the script wasn't up to what he brought to it. The character was disappointing, in the least. Allison Janney as his very disturbed wife was a little over the top too. It left me thinking the screenwriter and director were both really straining to paint villainy with these two characters. It smelled. Has no one heard of originality? Nicholson did the last credible evil Marine Colonel. There may never be another.<br/><br/>That about does it for me. I know I sat near the rear of the theater and saw four couples leave shortly after the garbage mouth scene from Suvari. I think she did it well, though. Too bad this is what we have degenerated to. She doesn't represent some far-out rebel, but a main-stream young woman. How sad.<br/><br/>As for the film's theme, decadent America has been done to death, so forget it and look for something new, will ya. I would have even liked to see Benning naked more than Suvari, at least that might have been more real and seemed less crude, crass, exploitative and pedophiliac. Besides, she's every bit as beautiful as the younger girls in this film."

The fact that a movie could suggest that the problem with America today is a profoundly spiritual one is something worth celebrating. So is a movie that forgets car chases and violent explosions and really explores the small details of our everyday lives.<br/><br/>I found the movie so riveting that I forgot to even eat my popcorn! It was a beautiful fusion of an intelligent script, fine cinematography, and (mostly) wonderful acting. Kevin Spacey's performance was a marvel: in the most economical way, just with his mouth and eyes, he conveys rage, sarcasm, despair, sneaky triumph, and yes, even tenderness. The change in his posture from slumpy to buffed was wonderful. The young actors were also brilliant, particularly Wes Bentley, who is so incendiary you just know that he has a huge career in front of him (""Yeah, keep after me, Dad"").  The only wrong note in the acting, I thought, was struck by Annette Benning: she seemed to be overacting (except for the moments when she was drunk and was at her softest). I know her character was tightly wound, but it could have been portrayed more subtly.<br/><br/>I thought the script had a few flaws, too.  The story was strong enough that it almost didn't need the suggestion of murder and the ""whodunnit' hook. There were a few contrivances that were almost sitcom-like (for instance, what Colonel Fitts thought he saw through the window vs. what was really going on). Perhaps that's because the writer, Alan Ball, apparently got his start in TV.  But that didn't prevent the whole film, particularly the ending, from being deeply moving.  I saw this film last fall, and am still thinking about it now, months later.  That's great moviemaking!"

I despise suburban living as well, but I really don't think that this movie spoke volumes about the 'burbs.

","Since it was released in early September, I guess we can technically call this a summer flick.  In a way, this movie deserves to be put up against the big summer blockbusters for comparisons sake.  But then again, it probably does not since it has far more depth and entertainment value than anything that was released this past year.  <br/><br/>Kevin Spacey was amazing in his role as Lester Burnham.  He gave me flashbacks to Usual Suspects, when he played the carefully-crafted Verbal Kint.  Lester is a complex individual who has been a slave to the ordinary over the years and has finally discovered his new-found freedom that allows him to keep living life.<br/><br/>The ensemble of characters that compliments Spacey is excellent.  Thora Birch and Wes Bently do a wonderful job. Annette Bening's character, Carolyn, is a perfect foil to Spacey's.<br/><br/>To top it all off, the movie is edgy.  It covers areas that seem to still avoid mainstream cinema.  Because of this, I feel that the Academy will ""overlook"" this film when it comes to Oscar time, like they have so many times before with other deserving works.

Expendable in his job and ignored by his family he proceeds to have a midlife crisis which affects all around him. He develops a crush on his daughter's friend (Mena Suvari, playing the nymphet role to perfection) and starts changing his life to follow his dreams.<br/><br/>The film manages the almost impossible task of displaying true humour and then ending with an emotional note but you can't see the join.

","The movie could have done without the narration at the beginning and end of the movie. This, in fact, was the biggest problem I had with the movie. The acting and cinematography were excellent, without a doubt, but I got a little hung up on the storyline being told from the perspective of ""Lester"" as there were so many scenes that he was not in, and could have had no knowledge of having happened. That's one of those thematic flaws that seem to happen a lot. It's because of that that I think Sixth Sense is better overall as a movie, with the continuity along the same person's perspective being able to make more sense. American Beauty was a pretty good movie, and a 7 of 10 is a much fairer assessment as to where it belongs. But I truly do wonder sometimes what movie all the folks who gave it a 10 saw. I missed that one! Maybe it's just because with all the other dreck out there (right now especially) that they couldn't help but overvalue it. Better than Shawshank Redemption or Schindler's List?

"Sam_Gray","10","0","0","6 March 2000"," Movies are almost never this good
","I have long resisted commenting on this movie because so many reviewers have compared it to Happiness, many claiming that Happiness is the better picture.  As a result, I became convinced that I needed to see Happiness before I could responsibly comment of this film.  Well, I saw Happiness this weekend, and it's no contest; American Beauty is definitely the better film (you can also read my scathing review of Happiness if you like).<br/><br/>By the way, I'd like to note that I saw American Beauty when it first opened, so I liked it before all the hype.<br/><br/>I'm in college now, but I grew up in the suburbs (including suburbs of Atlanta, Dallas, and Washington, D.C.).  I can promise, without hesitation, that this is the best representation of suburban life I have ever seen. True, the characters are arguably stereotypes, but they are REALISTIC stereotypes.  I can point to specific people in my past that are exactly like each of the three main teenage characters.  And, while I consider my own family to be extremely functional, I know several people who's family lives are similar to the Burnhams.<br/><br/>But, to me, the reason American Beauty transcends other films that have addressed this subject is that it is both realistic and optimistic.  This film acknowledges the problems with suburban life, but its message is one of hope and redemption.  I don't understand why some have interpreted this film as cynical or depressing.  From my view, American Beauty is a reaction to cynicism and, furthermore, a rejection of it.  The film's characters are only redeemed when they abandon their cynicism and/or negativity.<br/><br/>By the way, my personal opinion is that the female characters in the film are redeemed just as the male characters are (a lot of reviewers don't seem to agree).  For example, I think Carolyn's last action in the film really demonstrates that she is beginning to heal.  Think about what she does and keep in mind that she is not yet aware of another recent plot occurrence.<br/><br/>A perfect cast, a talented director, an inspired script, even an appropriately quirky musical score - American Beauty has it all.

","I surprised myself walking out of the theater, realizing that this movie was the best I have seen to date, inching Heat and Seven a notch down the ladder. It that takes great force, because they have been steady as rocks.<br/><br/>There are many many reasons for me liking this film so much. It is beautifully shot, with some great camera work - both in the film and the film itself! The actors perform extremely well, with Kevin Spacey at the front - but he has never performed badly, so... <br/><br/>The situation that the people in this film have become entangled in is a poignant look at what may come if you lose your lust for life. Trivial, boring and numb. The film has captured that very well.<br/><br/>There are depths to this film that I had no idea of before I went to see it. The final minute in this film is probably one of the most beautiful, serene and meaningful piece of film I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Another point about this film is how meaningless change becomes to some people if you let your boring, suburban life get the better of you; it doesn't matter to Lester's daughter whether he changes or not, she still thinks he's an idiot. And to his wife - well, she is just appalled at his ego trip.<br/><br/>And the way Lester drags the events with him as he goes on to rearrange his life and become more laid back and cool - he even becomes so cool about life that he in the end turns down the very reason for his want to change.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this film, and I am going to see it again very soon. It didn't change my life because I'm nowhere near being there yet. But it knocked the wind out of me nonetheless."

","I went to see the movie not only because of the heaps of nominations it received and the buzz surrounding it. But I like such dramas with irony, parody and dark humor.<br/><br/>The starting was good, and held my attention and laughter pretty well. I was disappointed however when the movie started focusing on the daughter and her relationship with the neighbour's only son. In my opinion, it was on the excessive side. On the other hand, Anette Bening's character was fun, full of sarcasm and totally a high point. It would have been better if the movie could elaborate why she was such a control freak and so concerned with career success when she has everything she needs in the material sense.<br/><br/>For a while too, it also appeared to me that the focus was on the dysfunctional neighbour family rather than Lester's. Again, we do not know why the mother (neighbour family) seems mentally unwell. Does the movie assume that the audience understand? Or expects the blame to be on the husband? I could not figure that one out too well.<br/><br/>My final query is: what came over Lester at the critical point? Why did he not indulge in fulfilling his fantasy?"

","""American Beauty"" is an interesting first film from a promising director. Still, like many first films, it lacks depth and proportion. At times, the film conjures images that cleverly lampoon the vacuousness of suburban America. However, these images never develop into much more than a knowing snigger. As a result, the film ends up appealing to the very smugness and complacency that it pretends to criticise. In fact, the movie's plot and imagery too often wallow in a jaundiced flippancy that sends middle-class audiences streaming out of cineplexes feeling oh-so-clever, but hardly challenged, and not even a little bit threatened."

So instead I will ask those of you who have already seen this motion picture a couple of important questions: <br/><br/>Can you take constructive criticism?  Can you avoid the natural human knee-jerk reaction of shutting off all rational thought when confronted with things disturbingly familiar?  If you can, then you probably walked away from this film marveling at its message and realizing that there is an entire world of truth and beauty beneath the surface of the everyday things we think so important.  If you cannot, then you are probably reacting to these words the same way you did to the film, - with loathing.  Truth hurts. But you know something, -- it need not.  <br/><br/>I went into this movie with an open mind, not looking for reasons to hate it or put it down simply because the vast majority seemed to love it.  I sat back and allowed it to work its ethereal and insinuating magic on me.  The truly beautiful thing about this film is that it will strike chords within you that will resonate throughout your soul, -- as long as you allow it to. The movies main message is that we are NOT perfect (nor should we try to be, regardless of what society says), --- only by accepting this fact in ourselves and in others can we truly reach peace and happiness.  However, before we in the audience can do this, we must first learn to get over the fear and embarrassment of having our naked souls bared before us, of seeing our own reflections in this disturbing but ultimately transcendental mirror known as AMERICAN BEAUTY.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

","American Beauty is a stunning film, superbly directed by Sam Mendes with a great screenplay by Alan Ball.  Its message is not entirely original (the themes of suburbia repressing people's true natures; appreciating beauty in the world; being true to yourself have all been explored before).  Rarely, though, has a film been this passionate about them.  This is in large part due uniformly superb performances from the cast.  The standouts are the mesmerizing turn by newcomer Wes Bentley and the absolutely brilliant performance turned in by Kevin Spacey (it will be a travesty if he doesn't win the Oscar).  Bentley's Ricky is creepy at first but slowly we come to understand that his intensity and serenity are due to an absolute appreciation of the world around him and its beauty.  Spacey, meanwhile, is stunning as Lester, simultaneously cynical, rueful, tender, sad  and sarcastic.  In the movie's second half, the actor achieves a level of acting that can be described as art.  As Lester comes closer to his own final epiphany, the final step in his quest to recapture the joy of living, Spacey will blow you away.  This is one of the greatest performances of the last decade and it is only the greatest achievement in a spectacularly good film."

The red door, the red car, the red flowers, the dark shadowed lighting - all melting together to make what is the movie - American Beauty.<br/><br/>This dark comedy runs its roots deep into a type of analytical psychology, casted on the audience by the directory and narrator.

","I would suggest that the makers of this film have no real sense of irony. A shame, because if they did then maybe American Beauty would be a great, as opposed to merely quite good, movie.<br/><br/>During the first 90 minutes I was tempted to give this film an 8 or 9 (though not the 10 that a staggering 53% of voters have given it), but its final quarter made me drop this rating to a more realistic ""7"".<br/><br/>The picture is beautifully shot, as befits the title, with its imagery of pure red roses against the naked human body a cinematic high point. I must confess to being a little disturbed at seeing 17 and 21-year-old girls (though both presented as 16 year olds) having to perform topless shots, though not the elder Annette Bening, who keeps her blouse and bra on even for sex scenes. Okay, that's a knee-jerk reaction I admit, but seeing a virtual minor disrobing is a little disconcerting in a movie. Then again there is much about American Beauty that is subversive. Does this film contain the most prominent usage of cannabis on celluloid? There is no moral debate about its use; other than it makes you high.<br/><br/>It's hard to describe what the film is actually about, as it has so many themes and issues coursing through it without it ever feeling forced or scattershot in it's approach. The basic thread of a man's midlife crisis and the stoic nature of middle-aged suburbia is something that was memorably approached in the British sitcom ""The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin"". Spacey doesn't end this film by faking his own death, though his wife (who is also undergoing a nervous breakdown) does have a tendency to scream in parked cars. The commentaries on the nature of beauty, death, sex and sexuality, commercialism and individualism are all well-noted, and it's worth the ticket price just to see Quantum Leap's liberal-but-macho Sam (Scott Bakula) as a homosexual. <br/><br/>But where it all falls down is in its need to constantly beat the viewer with its ""issues"". We are never allowed to make up our own minds about what is being played out on screen, there is no ambiguity or need for interpretation. This is a well-made, well-packaged film, and Spacey gives a career-best performance, but ultimately its agenda is billboarded throughout its duration.<br/><br/>This is certainly several steps up from the ham-fisted dictates of the similarly-overrated ""Truman Show"", but cinema-goers can enter the auditorium and switch their brains off for its two-hour run time. That's not to say that American Beauty is dumb - far from it. Just that every nuance, every satirical barb is spoon-fed with a saccharine coating so that no effort is required on behalf of its audience. The last few minutes conclude with an over-earnest justification from Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley), and Spacey wraps it up with a moral-of-the-story. It did make me want to take up weight training, though. Where's that bench press?"

","Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) plays a middle aged father whose role in life had been eroded at home and at work.  Times have changed and have passed him by.  His solution?  Simply let go of responsibility and live out the dreams and desires of his youth. He may be older but he's got the money to do it and nothing to lose.  Or so he thinks.  Burnhams wife (Annette Benning) is too high on her own career aspirations to take notice of her husbands midlife crisis of sorts.  Having totally embraced her role as a nineties woman exploring the limits of gender equality while actually undergoing a role reversal as the main bread winner of the family, she is essentially blind to her husband's dilemma.  The few glimpses she does get she matches with threats of divorce, to which her husband reminds her just how much her present career has been leveraged by his own self sacrifice.  And of course, stuck in the middle is the daughter who considers her father's recent behavior changes as downright creepy, especially since her teenage girlfriend is ground zero for his youthful fantasies.<br/><br/>But what makes the story truly fascinating is the character of Ricky Fitts, the Burnhams teenage neighbor whose interest in filming the world around him extends into the private world of the Burnhams.  He alone is in a position to understand, in his own unique way, the problems of the Burnhams.  His video recorder is like a key that allows him to capture what is missed by many: the hidden beauty in nature and people, just waiting to be shared and absorbed by the voyeur. <br/><br/>Similar to Mrs. Burnham, Ricky's dad has also been a victim to his career (as an ex marine colonel). Yet like Mr. Burnham, he has been left behind by changing times: his utter contempt for his homosexual neighbors, who the film wonderfully portrays as really the only truly happy and normal people in the local neighborhood, despite how society may view their sexuality.<br/><br/>Mrs Fitts is just the opposite of Mrs. Burnham, she has been frozen in time, probably a time more familiar to the fifties, and is totally subservient to her husband's world. She is basically a zombie, with none of Mrs. Burnhams dreams or goals, but like Mrs Burnham she is without the essential emotions to understand what is happening in the world because she is locked up in hers.<br/><br/>The film doesn't offer the viewer any new insight into life, only confirms what we probably feel or have felt.  But it does so in a manner that's very fresh.  It doesn't preach to us the way things should be, rather it puts a cross section of life under the microscope to be dissected and analyzed. American Beauty could have been a little shorter I think, and some parts seemed to drag out the message a little too long, but the acting, especially Spacey is very good."

","American Beauty, like The Graduate, exposes the issues of a generation.  The dysfunctional suburban American family as the nucleus of society, is shown in all its humanity, divisions and fading glory, as the new generation, in the form of the hero with his video camera and unique insight, is left to pick up the pieces of an older generation's conflict and shattered dreams, portrayed by the two middle-aged men- one who is a naive, unsuspecting victim who has just begun to realise his lost dreams of youth- his deep attraction to young Angela, (who is  one aspect of ""American Beauty"",) and the other an embittered, paranoid authoritarian whose intense, video-camera-eyed son shares a genuine bond that spans the generations with his unsuspecting generational counterpart. Jane, who represents the elusive, complex beauty that is for the first time within the artistic and psychological grasp of the new generation of filmmakers, finds love with this young hero who finds beauty in both life and in death. The opening and closing words of the film are those of Jane's youth-driven, socially alienated father. His fresh realisations as to the meaning of his life- elusive and barely reborn even as he unwittingly prepares for death, are passed on to his daughter Jane's newfound soul-mate with the camera.  As the new chronicler and artist- complex, darkly aware, and above all, human, he must now carry on a lost legacy and fresh hope,  in this passing of reins from one generation to the next. As a sixties ""boomer,"" of The Graduate days I was greatly impressed, reminded, and uplifted by this entertaining and poetically cinematic piece, and it was not without some degree of recognition and sadness that I realised how we had our chance, and whatever hope there was must be now handed down to my daughter's generation, who will reinterpret, criticise, glean insight and meaning in all aspect of human existence,  and make something that has never been made before. This is the job of any artist, and indeed according to the film's insightful director, of any human being who cares to give his life meaning.  Picking up the pieces from an older generation's legacy and heretofore unexplored conflicts, cannot be easy, but the work has begun and it astounds me. Go see the film."

","If there was any doubt that Kevin Spacey is the finest character actor of his generation, then American Beauty is the film that dispels it. My fear is that he will not be rewarded with an Oscar, a movie that so viciously attacks family and everything that America holds dear is unlikely to hold favour with the academy. Spacey's performance is yet another in a canon of ""career-bests"" and for the first time, as well as displaying his wonderful dramatic skills, his performance shows his capability for impeccable comic timing, for while the film is dark and brutal, the tremendous dialogue bristles with humour.  Spacey's performance while exquisite, is not the best or most suprising aspect of this movie.  Annette Bening, my experience of whom being limited to the rather dissapointing Mars Attacks, shows herself to be an actress of considerable range and talent - but in danger because of this of becoming steriotyped into neurotic, career minded characters. American Beauty will never be completely forgotten because it has the ability, as do all good films, to leave something that will linger forever. The 'plastic bag' scene is one of these moments - being funny, then ridiculous, then poignant and deeply affecting.  Thats the moment the critics will remember. What will stick with the rest of us are the scenes where the dialogue crackles with wit and panache, scenes which come along all the time. Revelations (like kids that can act ) add to the feeling of intense satisfaction that a film can come so close to the beauty it describes. The irony lies in the title. The beauty it promises is delivered, but is at the same time exactly what the film is attacking, tearing apart what lies at the centre of America. It dessecates what lies on the surface of perfection, and in delving deeper, into the ""deep filling"" of the American Pie it uncovers the reality, one that is both reaffirming and brutally cynical."

While I laughed thru much of the money, I was also continually disturbed.

One awakened to the breath of life and the others brought down by the ambiguity of life. `American Beauty' chronicles these surreal questions as we watch a family unwind. Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham who is sick of his wife, plagued by his job and wondering where his youth evaporated to. Lester's quest to unravel these problems and find a better path pits him head to head against his family. `American Beauty' is a movie that allows us to explore a little about ourselves and even more about the paths we take in life. The always bickering, frustrated Burnhams remind us that once in a while our lives just don't fit with the way we perceive things. The surreal boy next door who videotapes life has the ability to step back and look at just exactly how beautiful the world around us is. But I think the real revelation is we all have to ask life's question so we can relax and enjoy the journey we are on. As the movie unfolds and Lester's eyes open more and more we begin to see bright scenes of crimson red which detail his awakening. The magical tenderness of the rose petals detail Lester's obsession for youth but also show a sweet innocent tenderness in the object of his obsession.  Is this tortured teen the nymph she has been bragging about or does she to need to be awakened? This movie asks a lot of questions and erupts with an ending shocker. I have to take my hat off to another first-time director in Mendes who has given us a movie we will be looking back on for years to come. (4.5 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer"
"sirwinston","10","0","0","29 February 2000"," Take *Shawshank Redemption* and *Forrest Gump* and combine them with great films like *Godfather II* and *Amadeus*, and you have the most uplifting great film of all time...
","I cannot express how great a masterpiece this film was.  It's at once uplifting and emotional, visceral even, while still being a great film with great cinematography and a great script.  I once took a film course at a prominent liberal arts college, and *American Beauty* is easily the equal of any of the 25 classics we explored.<br/><br/>Now that I've used the word ""great"" so profusely, let me tell you why.  The script and its character-driven subplots aren't stereotypical, as some have demurred; rather, the characters are believable archetypes, true to real-world people most of us have known.  We can see truths in Kevin Spacey's portrayal of a man romanticizing his youth and lusting after its symbol, Mena Suvari as the cheerleader who looks like a 16-year-old wearing too much make-up in the belief that it makes her appear more mature; we can see truths in Ricky's lust for life and attempts to ""capture"" its essence--it's beautiful how Ricky, the quintessential outcast ""crazy"" and ""loser,"" is through his understanding of death the only person in the film who understands the meaning and beauty in life.  Reminds me of the poet Wallace Stevens' writings, in which ""Death is the mother of beauty""--i.e., the transitoriness and ephemeral nature of everything is what gives it beauty.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this film has a powerful philosophical voice speaking in harmony with delicious imagery of the beautiful--from Mena Suvari's supple bare adolescent breasts to the changing seasons you see in the trees, from rosepetals and flesh to the not-so-obvious beauty of a dead bird.  The most striking image is perhaps the confining suburban sameness of hundreds of identical houses and streets in a grid which we see at the start of the film--but most striking is that, as the camera pans out over that same suburban sameness at the end of the journey, it kind of looks beautiful, no longer oppressive, and peaceful.  Only a truly powerful film could subvert that image so completely.<br/><br/>The acting performances were also incredibly strong, which is important because above all this film isn't about imagery as much as it's about people and their relationships.  There's almost a pantheistic feeling to the film, in that happiness is found only by communing with the world around you, and loving your fellow man.  I am the type of person who lets a few tears slip when I see or read something truly moving, which is seldom; certain parts of the Bible and the Tao te Ching bring a tear to the eye; Alanis Morissette as a joyful God who childishly plays in the grass in *Dogma* brings a tear to the eye; but three times, at the bag-dancing climax in the middle, at the sight of Mena Suvari almost in tears by the moonlight, and at the surprise anti-climax at the end, three times did this film affect me that much.<br/><br/>To sum up, if this film doesn't affect you, you probably don't understand its subtexts and its truths.  If it doesn't, please watch it again and try to understand what it's like to be in these positions--which are very common ones--and to see the beauty of the imagery here and the philosophy depicted. It's rather like *Eyes Wide Shut* in that you either *understand* the film viscerally, or you just can't see its truths; but *Eyes Wide Shut* is about things most people won't understand unless they're middle-aged men, while *American Beauty* is more universal in its scope."

","Not surprisingly, most of the recent comments for American Beauty are more negative than positive.  Unfortunately, many people are seeing this film in its re-release after receiving eight Academy Award nominations, and are setting their expectations tremendously high and being disappointed. (Also, there are the ""I'm just too Bohemian to like any film that the masses like or the Academy chooses"" people who leave negative comments for spite).<br/><br/>American Beauty is gorgeously shot, and all of the performances are top notch (especially Spacey and newcomer Wes Bentley).  Most of the complaints revolve around the characters being too ""stereotypical"", and one comment said, ""Are we to believe this is where American society is heading""? Heads up people, we are already there, and these ""blatant stereotypes"" are you, your friends, and your neighbors.  Any person familiar with middle-upper class white America will find a morbid fascination in American Beauty, for the film presents a compelling, sordid, tragic tale that seems unlikely and dramatic - until you realize that you or someone you know is living it (or at least parts of it).  The best joke in American Beauty is that people are urged to ""look deeper"" and are unable to abandon their expectations of a mind numbing, happy trip to the movies to see that they themselves could be the apathetic man in the middle of a mid-life crisis, the cold, career driven wife, or the homophobe who alienates his children.  If you want a feel-good movie, go rent something with Julia Roberts or Sandra Bullock in it.  If you want a fascinating case study of just how bizarre but plausible life in modern America has become, American Beauty won't disappoint."

","I finally saw American Beauty the other night. I like to see all the oscar nominees.  I was really stunned that this movie was nominated for an academy award. The movie got off to a slow beginning. The characters were incredibly dislikable. The issues were cliche, and I think if the overall message was supposed to have been ""there is beauty all around us, even within all this ugliness"", that it was so subtle as to be practically insignificant. The movie simply wasn't beautiful enough for me to pull it out of all the ugliness. I found it disturbing, with little depth. If these people are ""modern archetypes"", then please just kill me now because I sure wouldn't want to be living in their neighborhood, I don't think I do, nor any of the rest of us..at least I hope not!  I have never been so stringently opposed to a particular movie winning the oscar in my life.  This was one of the least uplifting films I have ever seen..my feeling..just not that many good movies made this year and American Beauty is one of them. It is elevated to a status it doesn't deserve. It frightens me a little that people seem to identify with it so strongly..are we really such an angst filled people? I found it depressing and ultimately disapointing."

","The best movie I've ever seen! It's not very often that you see a movie that's so straight forward on real-life issues, and attacks what life really means.  This movie made me really think about who you are as a person based on what you do in life. Ah... and my favorite part of the movie, his job description.  Paying $7.00 to see the movie just for his job description would have been good enough for me!  This is a completely new kind of movie, and I believe that there should be more like it.  Kevin Spacey does the best job with his role as Lester Burnham than any other actor could have, I believe.  Definitely a MUST see."

","They say the american dream is to find that beautiful successful significant other for a lifetime, live in a two-story house  with a white picket fence, and have two children that are  not a disciplinary challenge. This will make you happy? Right!! Think again! We are now almost living in the 21st century my friends! Things have changed! The american dream is now to breakaway from your significant other by craving for your daughter's sexy friend, start buffing up so she could crave for you, and begin smoking some good weed. The american dream also now consists to have an affair with your business competitor but be careful not to get caught so your two-story house with that white (or should I say black) picket fence could still be yours. I have just described the plot of one of the best films of the year- ""American Beauty."" Without a doubt, it is the best-acted film of 1999. Kevin Spacey has just become the frontrunner for the Best Actor Oscar. There will be reason to suspect if he does not get nominated. You could beatty I mean bet that Annette Bening will also get nominated. Co-star Chris Cooper's performance is gripping, insightful, and simply sensational. It will not be too cool if Cooper does not get nominated for a Supporting Acting Nod. Young stars Mena Suvari, Thora Birch, and Wes Bentley execute some real cool thespian stuff also. It was just a film with all-star performances. I also congratulate the filmmakers of ""American Beauty"" for making a film that has put the black beauty back into cinema. This is one beauty that should not get away! *****Excellent"

","I saw this movie after it got nominated for best picture.  I have been a Kevin Spacey fan since seeing him in The Usual Suspects, but American Beauty was not high on my lists of movies to see.  Well, now I know why.<br/><br/>American Beauty is a not totally disinteresting look at what happens when pretty much every character hates his or her life.  I felt like this movie was far too depressing to be funny, save for a few lines that are just catchy.  The scene with Spacey and the consultant are outstanding from an ""office space"" point of view.  However, the movie tries to make comedy out of some really heavy subjects, and I found myself thinking about the true content of the movie too much to really enjoy the movie.  A favorite for best picture?  I don't see it."

","American Beauty is a highly intelligent movie with a clever balance of humour and seriousness. Every major character has a story, all of which are deftly interwoven, resulting in a touching, wonderfully funny film. One might imagine that seven or eight stories might crowd the plot of the movie, and yet American Beauty presents us with them with ease, and without seeming rushed or overfull. Kevin Spacey (as Lester Burnham) was truly brilliant as he always is; perhaps even better than usual. In fact, the casting is flawless, especially the seven or eight major characters - Spacey as Lester, Annette Bening as Lester's wife, Carolyn, Thora Birch as their daughter, Jane, Mena Suvari (who played Heather in American Pie with great grace and skill) as Jane's friend Angela Hayes, Wes Bently as Ricky Fitts, Chris Cooper as his father, Colonel Fitts, Allison Janney as his mother, Barbara, and Peter Gallagher as Buddy Kane. Quantum Leap fans also get the surprise of a small rÃ´le for Scott Bakula! Through an unusual set of circumstances, I ended up being given a couple of tickets to an exclusive preview screening (the release date of American Beauty for the UK and Ireland was 4 February 2000) of American Beauty. What a film! ... and to get to see it almost a week and a half before the rest of the country, and free of charge... You can't get a better deal than that. This is a thoughtful, contemplative movie, a beautiful and funny movie, and more than worthy of your time and money to go and see it."

","So, is this movie really so good, as so many critics praising it to the skies and so many mesmerised common viewers tend to think? It definitely struck a very ill American nerve with its chosen theme - A Great American Mendacity. The film starts off as a satire on shallowness of everyday life in Anytown, USA: Kevin Spacy's hero Lester Burnham is stuck with a dead-end job, whining money-grabbing wife, alienated daughter. LOOK CLOSER -Where does the story go from here? He meets his daughter girlfriend and gets extremely lusty about her. His re-awaken libido makes him do rather stupid things for a common upper-middle-class American, he starts body-building, trades in his Camry for a vintage hotrod, sends his employers a memo, proclaiming that his only desire in life is to have a regular masturbation, starts smoking pot, gets a Macjob at a burger joint. And, then he finds himself happy. Yes, that's all he ever wanted he's on cloud 9. This is presented like a realization of the American Dream according to the filmmakers of American Beauty. And they seem dead serious about it. This part of the plot is for boomers (one of the biggest stratum of the US movie-going audience). The other one is for another big movie-going stratum - teens. There's a dorky guy, who lives next to our typical American dysfunctional family. He's a home-movie enthusiast and a dope-dealer. He's moving force for the romantic part of the script. He falls in love with Burnham's angst-ridden daughter and they contemplate one of the most popular love-struck teens' plans since maybe Romeo and Juliet - to get away from their parents. This dorky guy has also another important element in the story - super macho tyrannical father, who adds a little spice to the somnolent pace of the movie by repeatedly beating his son for no particular reason. The father, who hides his Nazi aspirations, has his tour de force in the end when he performs 2 most ridiculously weird acts, he reveals his homosexuality to Burnham and then murders him. LOOK CLOSER: the reasoning for the final gruesome plot twist is arguable: perhaps the ex-Marine got ashamed of himself for revealing his true nature and decided to commit a final vendetta and go to prison for such a crime to nature. But more likely - the filmmakers didn't have any more ingenious way to end the picture but for this show-offy finale. The only scene where there are some signs of real life is Burnham's chance meeting with his cheating wife at a burger joint. It seemingly reveals the filmmakers affection for Beavis and Butthead cartoons, where scenes on this location were continuously perfected. In the beginning of the film, Spacy's hero says that he feels ""sedated"", that can be said about the pace of the movie. It's overly long: big meaningless pauses. The filmmakers were probably aware of this so they couldn't do without the usual attention-grabbing tricks. Like such trusted weapon as nudity (within certain politically correct limits, certainly). There's plenty of it: some justified, some - not very much. LOOK CLOSER - Why Burnham's daughter does perform a striptease in front of her nerdy boyfriend when he's videotaping her from his house? Well. She's got excellent pair of jugs of course, but is it really demanded by the story? Or, the filmmakers want to spice up the lifeless plot. And about the characters. LOOK CLOSER - Do they seem real? They are just caricatures, certain models that display particular typical traits. It's impossible to care less for any of them. Spacy obviously overplays his character, he plays Burnham like typical all-American bored 40-ish man. He plays him eh - boring. So, let's face it, AB is a formulaic lifeless product of marketing-savvy filmmakers. It has the usual pairing of good guys versus bad guys, only this time it's not some sort of Doomsday scenario, but a black comedy with socially acute theme. It's all the more fitting that it ends on another ridiculous note - Lester's voice speaking after he had been dead.<br/><br/>This film has taken America by storm. After similar unprecedented success of such zero-content marketing ploy as the Blair Witch Project anything can happen. P.S. There's no awe-inspiring metaphysical poetry in the plastic bag flying in the wind. PP.SS. In case you want a much more exciting portrait of an American family, go for Happiness instead."

","The first I heard of this movie was when watching American Pie this summer. In the lobby, there was a big cardboard standup of a newspaper article lavishing praise on the movie. Kevin Spacey is my favorite actor, and as soon as I read that he and Annette Bening were in it, I had to see it. Three months later, my friend at Berkeley saw it at a sneak preview and she loved it. So, the week it came out, I saw it. After I walked out of the theater, I didn't, or should I say, couldn't speak a word. I was in shock at how brilliant the movie was. I returned to see it the next day with another group of friends. A week later, I saw it again with a friend from another school. I saw it three times in seven days, and I couldn't stop thinking about it. This is honestly one of the best movies you'll ever see, if you appreciate brilliant acting, fine directing, and a picture-perfect movie. The cinematography and the colors are, appropriately, unreal. The storyline is brilliant, the score is touching, and the performances by Spacey, Bening, and everyone in the movie are incredible. If this movie doesn't sweep all of it's Oscar noms, then the Academy is a travesty. Last year's shrug of Saving Private Ryan was ridiculous, and if this movie doesn't win the top five, then I refuse to watch the Oscars again. Watch it with an open mind, and I promise you won't be let down. Furthermore, this cements Kevin Spacey's status as the most gifted actor in the business today. He departs from his ""usual"" character, and brings a nuanced, subtle, yet dynamic character to the screen. Watch his transition from a hunch-backed low-eyed loser, to a pumped-up, strong character. You will be impressed. I promise."

","I'm surprised at the popularity of this film, as it felt like a fable, but instead of archetypal characters, is populated mostly with contemporary stereotypes: The husband in midlife crisis; the status-starved wife; the body-image disordered daughter; her self-esteem deficient girlfriend; etc. Have these stereotypes crossed a line in the collective unconscious to become, as some have suggested, ""Modern archetypes?""  I don't think so. Archetypes are by definition very old, so for something modern to be one, it must in actuality be connecting to the deep-rooted, old form.  With the exception of Lester and Rickey, who seemed to be different sorts of pilgrims, all these basically dysfunctional characters seemed to me to map to a single, fairly static archetypes; the lunatic. While feared and revered, it doesn't do well to have too many lunatics in one story. Archetypal tales stick with one. A day after seeing it, ""American Beauty"" is already fading for me.

Nobody could possibly played a better performance for that character than him.<br/><br/>All Annette Bening movies are good (except The Siege), and she showed us how great she can be in this movie.<br/><br/>The quiet boy who likes to film everything...

He did one hell of a job.<br/><br/>American Beauty is one of the most realistic films of it's era, and it will be remembered for a long time. This movie isn't just about a story that *COULD* be true, but maybe it never happened. This movie was not based on a true story, but it did represented facts that happen in real life.<br/><br/>All those family problems can be real, and we all know that in this same moment, as I'm writing this (or you are reading this) there are people with the same kind of problems.<br/><br/>I really liked the way the movie focus on every character's way of thinking and sadness. All those people in there were miserable. Even the girl who thought she was something more than the rest of the people realized that she was nobody, and started crying.<br/><br/>The good thing is, some of the characters find a way to become happy and forget about their sad and miserable lives. Spacey's daughter finds the ""filming"" boy and they seem to be really comfortable together. Spacey quits his job but is still making money, and at the end before dying, his last words were ""I'm great"", which means, he didn't deserve to die.<br/><br/>It's such a tragic way to die, he was looking at his family picture, and thinking about all the good things, of course. His wife was realizing that she was not a victim and she was on her way to talk to him.<br/><br/>I really liked the way Spacey handles the fact that he found his wife with the ""King"". And they surely did have a good time together.<br/><br/>This movie shocked me, a lot. I can't stop thinking about it.<br/><br/>One of the things that makes you feel the movie inside you, and really feel that it's getting into you, is the background music. Yes, the background music played all the time was amazing. The people in charge of that department did a great job.<br/><br/>The movie's ending wasn't very nice. I wasn't expecting something like that. I wanted everybody to be happy.<br/><br/>This movie might have a message for the people who see it, it depends on how they interpret it.<br/><br/>I'll personally think it's telling us to enjoy all things in life. Don't waste time. Spacey himself said he felt like he was coming out of a coma, where he was for 20 years.<br/><br/>I'll rate this movie with a 10 out of 10. It's great.<br/><br/>And remember, the only day that can be called ""The first day of the rest of your life"" is the day you die."

","""American Beauty"" is the name of a kind of rose that doesn't have either thorns or scent. As such, it stands as a symbol of Lester's life, a life without peril (other than being threatened by the possibility of being laid off by a kid half his age), but also without charm or passion. The ways in which Lester seeks to escape such a life may strike us as puerile, but the fact is they are not important. The important thing is the call for personal freedom, and the refusal to live according to unacceptable standards simply in exchange of pretty things, like a big house, a neat garden and an Italian silk sofa.<br/><br/>The characters are all certainly clichÃ©s, but nevertheless they come through as real people: the fact that we have seen the man suffering a middle-age crisis, the unsatisfied wife, the beautiful but empty headed beauty queen, the disciplinarian marine, etc. in a hundred movies doesn't mean that such people doesn't exist in real life, and unlike other such movies, they are not presented to us here as beasts with curious habits to be shocked about, or as caricatures to be laughed at, but essentially as human beings that deserve our compassion. They are not heroes: like the flying plastic bag, they are ugly and cheap, but they are ultimately moving and poetic.<br/><br/>The performances are all brilliant, especially Kevin Spacey's: he wins all our sympathy, something that is not as easy as you may suppose, since his character's embarrassing and cheap side is shown to us in all its ridiculous glory. I don't know if he'll win the Oscar (which after all is mostly about studio politics), but his is one of the best performances I have seen in the last years. A few small sillinesses of the movie (such as Lester spitting his beer when he hears that Angela is going to spend the night in his house, or the Marine watching old Reagan movies) are not bad enough to spoil the general effect. I must say it is nice to see a movie that tells us how precious and unique life is, and does that without pouring the saccharine in. Hope it starts a trend."

","Here in the UK there is a total consensus that American Beauty is everything you could ever wish for from a film. Utterly baffling, if you ask me. It's also being held up as an illustration of how Hollywood is tackling those anti-American Dream themes traditionally left to the more independent-minded film-makers. In fact it's a perfect demonstration of why Hollywood should keep it's nose out.<br/><br/>American Beauty has it's moments: the plastic bag blowing in the wind begins a nice evocation of the banal beauty that surrounds us, but the rest of the film is either superfluous or has been done much better many times before. It's not profound in any sense, it's certainly not witty, it's implausible, the direction is stagey, and it's characters are, at best, updated stereotypes (so the film's sensitive, sympathetic figures are the two weird kids who dress in black? What a surprise).<br/><br/>And as for that performance... Kevin Spacey looks like nothing more than a Big Hollywood Actor beamed into a low-key film to do his stuff. He twitches and grins and smirks and wisecracks like, erm, Kevin Spacey! They might as well have cast Al Pacino and let him loose to chew up the set. Annette Bening, however, is great. Small consolation.<br/><br/>If it's valid for commentators to herald American Beauty as the epitome of a nebulous 'Suburban/Middle Class Underbelly' genre, then it's equally valid for me to say forget AB, see 'Happiness' instead."

I gave this movie a 9/10, but wanted to give it an 8.5.  On it's own merit, American Beauty is very well done, the acting and story are solid.  The most interesting thing that I found (it's been almost a week since seeing it) it what this movie does to the viewer.  It seems to suck you in and hold you in a place where time doesn't matter.  At one point I looked at my watch to see how much was left and was surprised to see how early in the movie we were, but then it seemed like the movie was over.  The curious thing is that even though the movie captivated my attention, it also manages to keep the characters from really involving you.  What I mean is you have a strange, morbid fascination with them, but you aren't encouraged to care for them.  It's like being a fly on the wall.  But is this movie worthy of a perfect 10 or even a 9?  I guess it depends on how you rate movies.  I use my past experience in deciding on what value this movie holds for me.

Even from the opening of the film, where you learn of Lester's eventual death, it is still a very shocking thing to see, something you never really expect to happen.

","I saw this movie in preparation for the golden globes, and I was terribly disappointed by the foreign press. This movie has to be nominated in every possible section! I was petrified by the brilliant dialogue, every scene being memorable standing alone and working towards the climax. While I thought Annette Bening was acting well, the performances of Thora Birch, Wes Bentley and Chris Cooper were outstanding. But no(!) actor can prevail against Mena Suvari and - as usual - Kevin Spacey. While Spacey is probably Hollywood's best actor at the moment, and a less-than-perfect performance seems impossible for him, Mena Suvari totally surprised me. I even went to see 'American Pie' just because of her. If it weren't for the age difference, I'd say I experienced the birth of a new Bogart-Bacall type of duo. Anyway, the film is great fun to watch, and throughout the whole movie you pray that Lester isn't going to die, even though it's probably the only way that poor guy is really able to leave his miserable life. I seldomly watched a comedy that was so tragic, a satire so serious, a fiction so true and REAL characters in a gripping, romantic, excellently-shot movie about the last week of a typical American (is he?). And all in one movie! I won't even start to mention the fabulous camera, directing, music, story, or the small parts which are all equally well played.

Reality nailed with unnerving ease. Unnerving on one hand but refreshing on another.

"Philby-3","Null","0","0","22 February 2000"," Escaping the Human Condition
","This is  a mordant tale of suburban angst in an age where success is mostly about money and moral compromise. Probably not everybody has a spouse having it off with the King (her real estate competitor), conceives a passion for one of his daughter's school friends (a ditzy cheerleader who does however look great covered in rose petals), has a paranoid military type move in next door, finds his daughter, who despises her parents has become involved with Colonel Crazy's weird son, and loses his job, like Lester Burnham. <br/><br/>
No wonder Lester tells us by voice over at the beginning `in less than a year's time I'll be dead'. A terminal mid-life crisis, in fact. Yet there is an element of universality about all this. The only work the economic machine offers a talented writer is doing P.R. brochures. Comfort and security are provided to those who conform, in thought and action, to the ruthless commercial ethic, like the rutting real estate brokers. Clever mavericks, like the mad marine's son, are able to play the system they reject. Honest rebels are shot.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey is fine as Lester, and I thought Annette Bening, though a bit full-on, gave us a good portrait as the adulterous wife, stimulated by sales performance rather than intimacy. The kids were all great too, especially Wes Bentley as Ricky, the weird boy next door, who turned what could have been a blue-eyed monster into a sympathetic character. As a mainstream picture from a big studio plenty of money has been spent on the production, itself something of a commentary. The direction has a light touch and we are not battered with the obvious.<br/><br/>At the end I wondered if the punches had had been pulled somewhat, especially where Lester's passion for the cheerleader is concerned. Wasn't he just a bit too nice? For that matter wasn't his wife just a bit too nasty? Well, it's a comedy, I laughed a good deal, and thanked my lucky stars I don't work in P.R. or have a wife in real estate."

","If only more American movies would be of the type of 'American Beauty'. I am beginning to spot a trend of more and more American (widely published) movies becoming less and less commercial. Recent examples are Doug Liman's 'Go' (1999) and John McNaughton's 'Wild Things' (1998; although I was annoyed by all the sudden plot-changes that for me appeared to be too much focused on surprising the viewer), But all in all it's a good development.<br/><br/>As a European one of the main reasons I can come up with why 'American Beauty' was such a huge hit in America is the fact many Americans recognize themselves in it. The perfect America family, as they want to be, is pure fictious. One can wonder if this makes 'American Beauty' a good movie, because adding some real American elements in the movie might lead to world-wide, but especially American appreciation.<br/><br/>But I must admit that Mendes did a pretty good job both making fun of and developing sympathy of America and the American dream (still one of the biggest fictions ever). But maybe it was Mendes' British background that makes the movie worth the appreciation.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey is marvelous and so is Annette Bening and Thora Birch absolutely is a talent as the ever-complaining, never-satisfied rebellent teenage-daughter that is annoyed by her father's hormones that still haven't laid to rest. And Mena Suvari as Birch's friend Angela is the perfect all-American Barbie-doll.<br/><br/>I loved some of the symbolism in the movie like the rose-petals (which reminded me a bit of the slowmotion effects in Bronwen Hughes' 'Forces of Nature' (1999)), although the talk about plastic bag was too much forced intellectual gibberish.<br/><br/>I guess (and I am writing that before the Golden Globes have been given away) that American Beauty will definately receive some Oscars and what I hope even more is that the trend of making un-American American movies will be continued, without really becoming a true trend."

","Sam Mendes' American Beauty is the most auspicious directorial debut since, well, Citizen Kane. American Beauty is a sprawling, kaleidoscopic masterpiece of a film. It's not flawless, it has more than few quirks (Spacey's contradictory alcohol abuse/physical fitness obsession, for instance), but in the end, none of them matter. The virtuosity of Mendes' direction is totally captivating: this is one of those rare films where every camera angle and movement seem to be completely perfect.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening give the performances of their careers. Spacey's work is utterly spectacular. He steals every scene he appears in as he adroitly shifts from self-loathing loser to ecstatic rebel. This is the film he will be remembered for. Bening is superb as a self-absorbed, power-obsessed real estate agent. Chris Cooper is also excellent in a role he seems to have been typecast for, the apopleptic and abusive father.<br/><br/>The film has an excellent pace, wonderful cinematography, and the most powerful use of visual metaphor in recent memory. It's better than GoodFellas, better than Pulp Fiction, better than Schindler's List, better than The Shawshank Redemption, and better than Life is Beautiful.

When I saw the film I said to myself Is this the way the American family has gotten to?  The movies and TV portray the family as how the world sees it.  This film is disturbing, but it is correct that the family is not as strong holding or moral as it has been.  That parents and their children are not as close anymore.  Marriage is an boring institution, work for success is what we should long for.  American Beauty is good that it shows us the realism of todays American family sad but true.

","What this movie is about is that everybody has some beauty in them, and that if you, as the tagline says, ""look closer"", you might see something unexpected.<br/><br/>The plot is about a middle-aged loser, Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), who is stuck in a dead-end job in American suburbia.  His marriage with his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) has gradually turned lifeless, and he has a difficult parental relationship with his daughter, Jane (Thora Birch). All that occupies his dull daily thoughts are his fantasies about Jane's best friend, the sexual predator, Angela (Mena Suvari).  Next door are the Fitts family, who are even more dysfunctional than the Burnhams are.  The father is a brutal ex-army general (Chris Cooper) who takes out his sexual frustration on his voyeuristic, dope-dealing teenage son, Ricky (Wes Bentley).  Also around the house is the ghostlike mother (Allison Janney).<br/><br/>In the course of the story, the characters pair off with each other in unusual circumstances - again giving us new insights into their psyche that we never thought were there.  The strangely obsessive Ricky and the repressed Jane; Carolyn and her real estate rival, ""the King""; and our hero Lester, with Angela.<br/><br/>But this is only the most basic of plot descriptions.  Allan Ball's script is punctuated with moments of uproariously funny encounters and observations, as we see Lester go through life discovering, in less than one year, what has taken him more than four decades to find existed.  Kevin Spacey gives an outstanding performance as a once-boring man that has now learnt how to enjoy life, and is now hilariously unpredictable and spontaneous.  He thoroughly deserves the Best Actor Oscar come this March. Spacey is also ably assisted by the marvelously materialistic Annette Bening and the charismatic Wes Bentley.  In fact, Bentley's character, Ricky, is perhaps what Lester is aims his life at.  Ricky has sensed the beauty of the world, and says that now he is ""not afraid"" of anything. Sam Mendes provides a stunning directorial debut, one that mirrors the materialistic world of suburban society at first, and then peels back the layers to reveal life's many dimensions.  He too, deserves to be honoured at this year's Academy Awards.<br/><br/>Of course, there are flaws in this film, just like any other.  Some may find the pace a bit slow going, and even more will find it a mite pretentious. But most will find American Beauty, if nothing else, entertaining and funny. It will win the Best Picture Oscar this year, and if for that reason alone, go see it."

I would add a little more vigor to the movie, a little more of this change the main actor goes through, and more humor.

","Reading some of the comments here on IMDB makes me sad.  Those people who can't see past the plain plot and only get the ""full of beauty enough to explode"" message are missing a real treat of metaphorical content and soft-spoken beauty.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie's characters are a suburban family.  Those people who think that the movie is *about* suburban life are really missing the key.  The movie describes a seemingly plain family in a plain neighborhood;  yet the family is surrounded by beauty (internal and external) and doesn't know it. In one sense it helps that they are in suburbia because it would seem that life there is so plain.  In another sense it really hinders the point from getting across, because everyone now assumes it's just about ""life in the suburbs"".<br/><br/>Somehow I doubt that I am the only one who is either afraid of becoming a victim or is already a victim of the sedative, coma-inducing nature of every day life's hum-drum.  The reason this movie excels is because it doesn't take the easy route (ala Fight Club) and seemingly condemn this type of life as some sort of torturous affair.  It's easier to be negative than positive. Fight Club takes the easy route.  Granted, it does a terrific job of taking the easy route.  The hard route -- somehow transcending the drudge of everyday life -- is far more difficult.  That is where American Beauty really impresses me.<br/><br/>To say the movie is simply about one man who is rediscovering his youth is grossly oversimplifying.  All of the characters in this movie at some point *do* something about whatever it is that is bothering them.  For this reason there is no character in this movie that could be described as ""pure evil"" as we might see in other dramas made poorly.  Even the homophobic father, although certainly not someone to admire, at least is better understood and is someone to be pitied.  And the young daughter, whose inner beauty remained invisible to her superficial high-school peers; who is so beaten-down with the superficial images of society that she more or less assumes that it must be her breasts aren't large enough and that's why she isn't as happy as her ""friend.""<br/><br/>And yet there are many other levels to this movie.  The use of colors is astounding.  I could write an entire college paper on the use of red (although I might end up paying a lot of money to see the movie multiple times).  So many metaphors in this movie... the neighbor's ""plate"",  the symbolism of flowers (the mother has a garden where she prunes and keeps them;  Lester's visions;  the roses in the vase towards the end, etc).<br/><br/>This movie reminds me a lot of the Graduate.  In fact this movie could almost be said to be a sequel to it -- about a period in life / society a bit later but still with similar existential undertones.  And, at least in my book, it ranks right up there with the Hoffman classic.  This is my favorite movie this year, ranking higher than the utter masterpiece Princess Mononoke and the strange but beautiful Magnolia.<br/><br/>This movie is moviemaking at its best -- an enthralling plot dripping with metaphors, beautifully filmed, and with superb acting.  If you want teeny-bopping cheesy love stories with lame endings, go see Titanic.  If you want more obvious feel-good stories, stick with Good Will Hunting or Dead Poets Society.  If you want quality drama/black comedy dripping with metaphors, go see this one."

The cast is excellent (Kevin Spacey has never been better!) and some fine directing, editing and cinematography make for a darkly satisfying experience. Yet beneath all this, there is a deeper, more compassionate message.<br/><br/>Even the apparently oxymoronic title is clever, since it describes the journey which the movie takes. From `American' to Beauty, from superficiality to depth, from lust to compassion, and from a lliving death to a true appreciation of life in the moment of death.<br/><br/>A central image of the movie is a video, taken by the boy next door, of a plastic bag dancing in the wind. To him this was the most beautiful thing he had ever filmed. To me this summed up what this movie was all about. The bag was a metaphor for the characters presented to us: empty; products of a consumerist society; plastic people'. Yet something - the wind - was animating this bag, making it dance and swirl, making it beautiful. Just as the breath of life was animating these characters and making them beautiful, even if they didn't know it. This is the ultimate truth which is stated so clearly by Lester at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The tagline they're using on the advertising material for the movie is `Look closer'.

"Josef Tura-2","6","0","0","24 September 1999"," Twisted! Brilliant?
","Is this film a work of genius or perversity? Firstly, Kevin Spacey deserves all the credit for everything good in this film. Few performances have moved or puzzled me more. His character is sympathetic and sickening, hillarious and terrifing. The movie revolves around him, the other characters are merely his foils.  His performance was spellbinding and because of it I want to like this film. But I can't... well, not entirely.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes and Alan Ball seek after perversity and controversy too methodically. It is the difference shock art and art that arouses controversy. The underlying force was attracting attention rather than showing us a personal vision. Perhaps that is why Spacey's performance is the core of this film. It is in a sense the vision of the film. Another actor might have destroyed the film by simply acting the material for an Oscar nomination. Spacey is the film.<br/><br/>Only Spacey and Wes Bentley seem to care about their characters. The other actors and the direction feels exploitive. I was especially disturbed by the Col. Fitts character. He was too much an intentional counter-stereotype and not enough a real person. He resembled a one-dimensional villian from typical Hollywood fare, scripted only for plot development. First, he behaves in a completely stereotypical manner, even grunting at a paper ""the world's going to hell"". Then his character's reality is sacrificed by the film for shock-value. In other words, first he only does what we expect, then he only does what we do not expect. Rather than a character he is a convenient cipher who can be sacrificed with out arousing politically correct controversy. I am disappointed that a film that in other respects was so innovative had to resort to cheap tricks for plot development. The gay neighbors too, are only stereotypes. They are caring, genteel, urbane and completely manufactured. <br/><br/>The film's strange finale approaches the spellbinding level of the best films of all time. It combines the strengths of the movie and turns a sickening tragedy into a strangely poignant and hauntingly uplifting conclusion. Just for that ""American Beauty"" is worth seeing even if it falls short of its true potential."

","This film is not a tragedy whatever anyone else says. And I know I won't give too much away when I say it has what I consider a happy ending (for me that means like...satisfactory closure). This, an original american tale by english director Sam Mendes. Watching the first 20 minutes the story seemed to follow a formulaic line regarding dysfunctional families, etc etc. I kept waiting for the inevitable plot developments to kick in except the formula didnt follow its usual route much to my surprise and the rest of the audience too I suspect. There are worthy performances all round here and both Spacey & Benning have recieved worthy mention. But light praise must also be given to Wes Bently & Thora Birch for showing us the angst and pain of growing up different in that special world inhabited by teenagers where being the same and trying to fit in is all that matters. Not my pick for best picture this year (I give it 7/10)but a well structured film with some touching moments regarding the basic human flaws in us all....And its also not a bad commercial for Sony digital camera's.<br/><br/>I might just get one.

","What is beauty? Surely, few people are able to answer to this question, but watching ""AMERICAN BEAUTY"" it is easy to know what beauty is, what is its meaning. I have never, NEVER, left a movie feeling so sure of how beautiful is the world we live in, till I've seen this masterpiece. Some people, who did not see the movie, asked me my opinion about it, and the only thing I was able to tell them was ""Nothing I can tell you about ""American Beauty"" can be compared with such a beautiful poetry this movie carry in it. Kevin takes place as one of the most important actors of cinema history, and every, EVERY single character has a special beauty in this movie. Benning is brilliant and there's no one who can substitute any of the actors in scene. Director SAM MENDEZ made a great job, the cinematography is fantastic, wonderful editing, that proves that is possible to make classics without using more than 2 hours of projection. The only thing that's not perfect in AMERICAN BEAUTY is its characters, because they are real. This movie is real, so real that you will leave the theater with the great sensation of feeling that beauty can be found just by your side and everything you must do to appreciate it is... look closer."

Kevin Spacey gives a brilliant performance! It has been so long since I have seen a really good movie. I will definitely see it again! As a side note, I got my hands on the real script and though the story is essentially the same, it provided a rather unusual twist as bookends in a courtroom.

I think it's the best film I've seen in quite a while.<br/><br/>I won't go on, but let me say this.  For those who didn't like the movie, there's something in one of Spacey's last lines that addresses this -- a very ironic twist, as if he's anticipating that some of the audience won't understand the movie's point.<br/><br/>I remember that line more than any other in the movie ... if you didn't like the film, it probably slipped right past you and you  won't remember it.

","What you are about to see is, perhaps, the best performance ever given by Kevin Spacey. This truly spectacular film by director Sam Mendes is a tender yet violent, happy yet angst-ridden journey into suburban America and into one perfectly-average family with no skeletons in their closet. Or are they? As the trailer would suggest, 'look closer'.<br/><br/>Reminiscent of The Ice Storm, it is about the dysfunction of the average family, but far more. American Beauty is a truly original work, with surprising humour and depth. It is a work of art; a cinematic masterpiece.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around the Burnham family; father Lester (Spacey), mother (Annette Bening), daughter (Thora Birch) and her best friend (Mena Suvari). Career-minded Bening seems to call the shots; henpecked, long suffering Spacey is about to lose his job, daughter Birch is dismayed with the pair of them and friend Suvari is superficial, believing that she is the most attractive girl of her age, but offers nothing more in depth.<br/><br/>So far, you might be thinking, this is like a great many pictures centering around a family with problems. Wrong. American Beauty is full of surprises - not in the dramatic twist sense of films like The Sixth Sense - no, this is far too subtle for that.<br/><br/>As the central couple's marriage begins to fall apart, in a non-aggressive form of boredom and attrition, the characters begin to regress to their unfulfilled youths, in an attempt to accomplish all the things they never did, tie up loose ends, and 'find themselves' again.<br/><br/>It's nearly impossible to explain this film in text. It needs to be seen. From whichever way you look at it, be it cast, acting, script or photography, this film is awesome. Do I need to say any more? Get your tickets."

","Stupendous film debut from theatrical director Sam Mendes (""Cabaret"", ""The Blue Room"") that's a must-see for anyone who enjoyed Ang Lee's ""The Ice Storm"". Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening are at the head of a small family who it appears are coming apart at the seams: Bening's real-estate business can't seem to do as well as ""real-estate king"" Peter Gallagher, and Spacey hates his job so much he's willing to quit and work flipping burgers at a fast-food joint. Their daughter Jane (Thora Birch, in an amazingly mature performance) has to deal with insecurity and self-doubt in the face of her gorgeous model-hopeful best friend (Mena Suvari), plus figure out what to do with the intense neighbour (Wes Bentley) who seems to be obsessed with her; Bentley has his own plot on the side dealing with his military-obsessed father (a terrifying Chris Cooper) and his positively vacant mother (Allison Janney). Mendes' switch to film was the perfect thing to do; he seems to have no difficulties in understanding the medium, layering the film with incredible subtext and getting his actors to underplay over-the-top roles. Spacey absolutely shines as a man breaking free of a suburban nightmare and trying to really find the ""beauty"" in life, as does the ever-beautiful Bening, who seems to grow more fascinating as the years go by. Thomas Newman's unsettling score is one of the film's greatest assets of this, one of the very best films of the year."

","Life, as Lester Burnham (played by Kevin Spacey) tells us in the opening scenes is not as perfect as it appears. ""We're only a commercial for a happy family,"" he says. With an emaciated, brittle, acquisition-driven wife played by Annette Bening, and a seemingly uninterested and inscrutable Thora Birch as a typical detached ""my parents are total ***holes"" daughter, it is no wonder that Lester is numbly standing on the edge of the precipice.  And what a precipice it is.  Birch's friend, a Lolita of unlimited bravado thinks Lester is ""sexy"".  Next door a pot selling eighteen-year-old follows every move around him with a video camera, while dodging urine tests and beatings by his Marine Corps father (brilliantly played by Chris Cooper). In fact the only normal family on the street are the gay couple, Jim and Jim who welcome the baffled Marine to the neighborhood with a basket of flowers and pasta.<br/><br/>Spacey is well known for the all-important 'nineties-style irony in all roles. Roles such as the robber who follows Meryl Streep to her therapy group in ""Heartburn"" wielding a gun while saying ""sorry about your ring, lady"", and as the SOB in ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" and the wise-too-late detective in ""L.A. Confidential"" established him as a kind of humorous/tough wise guy. In ""The Ref"" he played a kind of put upon husband done lite.  But here Spacey is a weak tree thrashed by the demands of his frustrated wife and brown-nosing job.  When the whack finally comes the core of his ego and longing emerge with startling effects. He seems to leap into his life free of responsibilities. But is it a leap or a fall?  He clearly enjoys every minute of it, savoring his newfound freedom and the chaos it creates.<br/><br/>As the confluence of events lead to a stunning conclusion, you will find everything you thought you knew about these characters blown away. Those who approach the film with preconceived notions of familiar character types should check them at the door. Because in this house, as in most houses, you really have no idea about what takes place within.<br/><br/>This is a movie that must not be missed.

","The most remarkable thing about this movie is its success, considering that is not a particularly remarkable film. Very capably scripted, acted and directed I found it to be compelling viewing that entertains and, up to a point, illuminates in its examination of a regular family in the 'burbs.<br/><br/>But the 'great' movies as measured by box office success or critical acclaim are generally characterised by more extreme situations and characters than we find here. So what is it about this piece that has struck a chord with cinemagoers and critics alike?<br/><br/>Perhaps it is the very ordinariness of the characters, who would be almost caricature stereotypes of people we recognise if they were not so well drawn? Maybe the rutted tracks of domestic life, love, work and parenthood are too poignantly familiar not to make us squirm inwardly, but with pleasure? Could it be because the main protagonists all manage a form of escape from their lives of quiet desperation - even central character Lester Burnham (superbly played by Kevin Spacey) appears to have cheated death by speaking to us from the grave, no mean feat even by 21st century standards.<br/><br/>
Overall, I suspect a major factor in its success is that audiences are finally ready for mainstream releases with simpler, well-told and portrayed stories that help place us. From the beginning, movies have been seen as vehicles to take us out of ourselves by showing us a bigger, more exciting and dangerous world beyond our neighbourhood.

Regular film goers should already be well aware of Kevin Spacey's class, but it's Annette Bening who really shines. If only to stop anything with Tom Hanks in it, then 'American Beauty' could be that rarity. A decent Oscar winner."

","Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a man who wakes up one morning to discover he has been in an emotional coma for the last 20 years. That evening he attends a high school basketball game, where he meets his daughter's jailbait best friend Angela (Mena Suvari). She inspires Lester to return to his youthful vigour and completely reinvent his life. This forces his family and neighbours to reinvent their lives. As events become more and more convoluted, Lester finds himself less and less in control of his life... <br/><br/>This film has already been hailed as the greatest of all time even over the likes of Citizen Kane and The Godfather. But is all this praise deserved? Well I certainly think it is. Director Sam Mendes and screenwriter Alan Ball both make their feature debuts: Ball used to write sitcoms, while Mendes is an acclaimed theatre director, whose most recent success was last year's The Blue Room. Mendes is also British and lends an outsider's viewpoint to Ball's very American story. It portrays each participant as both a caricature and a human being, something great comedy writers excell in doing. <br/><br/>I am running out of adjectives to describe Kevin Spacey's greatness, but now ""funny"" can be added to the heap. The film's comedy takes almost every form, from traditional (Lester picks up his briefcase and the contents fall out), to wit (""Today I blackmailed my boss for $60,000. Pass the asparagus""), to farce (Lester's neighbour thinks he is paying his son for sex, rather than dope) to very dark satire. The entire cast is outstanding in fact, but the best performance is Chris Cooper's as the afore-mentioned psychotic neighbour, who violently beats his son.<br/><br/>It takes some time after the film to digest everything that has occured and work out what it means. The script shares major similarities with Fight Club (a man rejecting upper-middle-class to violently rediscover himself) and 70's British sitcom The Fall And Rise Of Reginald Perrin, which has an almost identical story, several hundred shades lighter, and is a source Mendes himself acknowleges. But whereas Fight Club is about being human, American Beauty is about being as human as possible. It shows that we can learn about ourselves, that we all have hidden depths. Sometimes they are exposed,  sometimes repressed, some are constructive, some destructive. But we must never be afraid of them. They make us what we are, who we are.<br/><br/>So what, other than a film, is American Beauty? A comedy, a tragedy, a drama, a murder-mystery, a social comment, a psychological comment... But it is one thing above all others. It shows that we don't really know who we are, and that we really ought to find out. It is a state of mind."

"Tim Gomersall","9","0","0","15 February 2000"," A bizarrely optimistic film that finds beauty amongst ugliness.
","By the time this film reached Britain the rave reviews it received in America had long since found there way over here- this is of course a mixed blessing; nothing ruins a great film like unrealistically high expectations. I was pleasantly surprised, then, to come away genuinely moved.<br/><br/>This was mainly due to the fact that the tone of the film was nothing like what I was expecting; reviews and trailers alike make the movie out as much more of a comedy than it actually is. While there are indeed some very funny moments, this is principally a poignant film. It suggests that all we really need to do to achieve the happiness we spend our lives searching for is realise that we are constantly surrounded by it, we just don't recognise it. When we are invited to see the most beautiful thing that the camcorder obsessed Ricky has ever taped, we expect anything other than the fluttering plastic bag which it turns out to be. It's an interesting point; anything, if viewed from the right perspectives, can be beautiful. On the way home from the film, every piece of flying garbage I passed seemed that much more pleasant.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes' direction is fantastic in its understated and discreet approach, which makes the apparently every day family's blatantly non-everyday activities all the easier to swallow. The score is perfectly balanced, at some times the stuff of fairy-tales, and at other times hauntingly moving; I am a great believer in the importance of a good score, and American Beauty is complemented well by the quiet and subtly affecting music which Thomas Newman has furnished it with. The plastic bag scene would only have been half as memorable without the sense of sadness that the music helped to instill in it.<br/><br/>The acting is first rate throughout; I don't think Kevin Spacey has ever put a foot wrong, so his fine performance is no surprise, but all the other actors in the film, particularly the younger cast members (who give courageous and utterly convincing portrayals of mixed up youth in an equally confused suburbia) are equally excellent.<br/><br/>The message of beauty amongst ugliness is the driving force of the film, and it's an interesting one. Whether or not you subscribe to the theory that a plastic bag flapping in the wind is the most beautiful thing you'll ever see is down to your own personal judgment. This film, however, with its strangely optimistic message that you can always find beauty and happiness if you stand back from your ingrained perspectives and look for it, should move even those who don't see the appeal of such projectile polythene."

","Frankly speaking, I appreciated the movie quite a lot, but I don't understand all the hype about it. It is good, but not so extraordinary.<br/><br/>It reminded of French movies such as 'Une liaison pornographique', or 'Chacun cherche son chat'. I am also tempted to compare it with 'Short cuts', from Robert Altman, or 'Happiness' (Tod Solontz), not for the same reasons of course. The formers because of the characters' psychological complexity' (no good/evil divide here), which are ordinary people with human feelings and reactions, not caricatural heroes. One of the great  plus of the movie is indeed to succeed in combining these characters with a satirical portrait of modern life, and the pressure it puts on individuals: the imperative to be a winner, to look handsome and attractive and not ordinary. It stresses quite well this new kind of conformism which oblige people to become 'unordinary individuals'."

"gagliano","Null","0","0","13 February 2000"," First of all....I liked it.
","First of all....I liked it. ""American Beauty"" is definitely a unique film. After viewing it, one can definitely say that it is highly unlikely that they have ever seen a film quite like it before. Do I recommend it, well it definitely depends upon your frame of mind at the time you plan on seeing it. There are a few frames of mind in which I think you should see this film...1) if you are in a good mood and not willing to take life too seriously; 2) you're feeling cynical about the American family and are questioning our values and need supporting evidence; or 3) you think your own family is messed up and need a point of comparison. If you are in any of the above three frames. I think you will enjoy this film tremendously. However, if you are going to a movie to escape life's problems and be entertained...I suggest you stay away. Kevin Spacey plays a father going through a psuedo mid-life crisis, quits his job and searches for happiness in his marriage and in daily living. Annette Bening is Spacey's wife, who has passed through her mid-life crisis and has embarked upon life's next stage....only to be brought back to reality by her husband's behavior. Add to this setting, an introverted daughter, gay neighbors, and a militaristic conservative minded neighbor and his rebellious son and you have a typical American neighborhood....and maybe not. Dreamworks produces a film that crosses many boundaries and embraces quite a few taboos without questioning the impact or challenging the results of such behavior. The film simply presents a version of an American family and their neighbors and then lets the audience decide whether or not to accept it. Can the audience relate the characters? You sure can. Can you identify with each and every character?..probably not....but again you don't really know your neighbors or the people down the street do you? Bottom line....you may feel that American Beauty is a very good film, but you will definitely agree that it is not a feel good film."
"Daff-4","8","0","0","13 February 2000"," A superbly crafted film. Intelligent, amusing and thought-provoking.
","This film is superb.<br/><br/>When I first saw the preview, I wrote it off as just another cliched piece on dysfunctional families and mid-life crises.  It is far from that.<br/><br/>
If I was to pick one thing that really sets the film apart from your average Hollywood dross, it would be the number of well-defined characters.  Even in a GOOD film, it's rare to find more than one character that you can relate to or feel any empathy with.  This film has MANY.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey is, of course, the stand out.  His performance (as a man whose passion for life is rekindled after he becomes infatuated with one of his daughter's teenage friends) is stunning.  His character is at once funny, poignant and moving.  I laughed at virtually every word that came out of the man's mouth.<br/><br/>Annette Bening is also very solid as his wife and I thought Thora Birch did a great job as the slightly troubled teenage daughter (a role which is almost always screwed up).<br/><br/>Wes Bentley (aka 'the spooky guy next door') was also impressive, as was Mena Suvari (who looked like being the ONLY two-dimensional character in the film, up until the final moments).   Even the cameos are good!  (watch out for Peter Gallagher's 'who's the king, who's the king', 'how does it feel to get done by the king!')<br/><br/>All in all, it's hard to fault this film.  It's extremely funny, easy to relate to and quite uplifting (in its own weird way).  It also manages to steer clear of the usual cliches and stereotypes that films like this normally ooze (with the possible exception of Colonel Fitts - and even then I still enjoyed his character).<br/><br/>Don't miss it."

The kiss given by Mr Fitts to Lester is a clue of the weakness of a man, who loved nazis theories for their strength and hated homosexuals, the weakest people in the world. Angela invents a lot of sexy stories to erase that virginity never lost. Lester was a ""false strong"", but he tried to be real (and weak) and to let discover to the others their humanity, made of weakness too.

","American Beauty is the kind of movie that adults go to see.

I would almost rate this as a 'slice of life' kind of movie.<br/><br/>What lack in so many of today's movies are movies that have meaning, and Hollywood is so caught up in the explosions and trucks overturning... Makes you feel like staying at home and watching ""The Dukes of Hazard"".  But this movie has content; this movie has issues that any adult who has lived their life and been out in the workforce has thought about.  Aren't there more times than we care to admit, where we would rather do it all over again.<br/><br/>
Kevin Spacey's character decides too, and Annette Bening is dealing with life crises of her own.

This is a great movie to watch because so much is happening."

","This is rather an accomplished movie. It's easy to make generalisations about national identities, typically negative and insufficiently self-critical. Certain aspects of American contemporary culture even grate against the sensibilities of this reviewer, but I was delighted to have recognised an aspect of the American psyche that I'd hitherto found appealing represented in this film.<br/><br/>That aspect is best represented in an intimate moment between the teenage neighbours, Wes and Thora, after the couple have viewed Wes's favourite piece of film-making. Moved by his own commentary of the footage of a plastic bag vacilliating in the wind against a brick wall, Wes is comforted by Thora in a moment of pure, unadulterated confiding, culminating in their touching. What I found particularly commendable about their exchange, and peculiarly American, was the candour and confidence with which they related to one another each others' feelings.<br/><br/>The film is littered not with plastic bags but with equally dramatic exchanges, such as Lester's compassion (played by the superlative Mr Spacey) towards the tragi-comic, and misdirected, coming-out of his neighbour, Colonel Fitt; and his equally noble resolve not to penetrate Angela, his dream-object come submissive in real life . . at the moment at which she most confided him.<br/><br/>Beauty may not be only skin-deep, but in exploring that aesthetic, the film does us the service of not disregarding whatever evident beauty may prefigure in Angela either.<br/><br/>There is also a beauty in the disembodied voice of Lester, at the beginning and at the close of the film, alerting us both to his future demise and to the putative general truth of the facts about ours. I have only to say that this is one of the few successful voice-overs in cinematic history (see also Fearless (1993)), the potential for wanton audio-visual narrative clash being the norm (e.g. (The) Fight Club (1999), Bringing Out the Dead (1999), Legend of 1900 (1998), to name but a few recent hang-overs).<br/><br/>It is typical of the accessibility of this film that it depicted in its vision of beauty an everyday, non-biodegradable object, a plastic bag."

A comedy which dealt with issues like nothing else. Annette Bening acting well? It was too much. There was flawless acting by the whole cast except for maybe Thora Birch who was good, but not flawless. Kevin Spacey gave me one of those acting moments you only get once a year. One of those moments which are so real it's scary. So real that you shiver in your stomach. Although this moment wasn't as strong, the only other actors who have showed such complex and intense emotions were Toni Collette in 'The Sixth Sense' and Meryl Streep.<br/><br/>To round up,a  great and very in-depth screenplay, well deserved of the Golden Globe, very good acting, good directing and a great thought provoker."

","This Sam Mendes film truly is a coup de grace among mediocre substitutes. This scarily accurate portrayal of the various people who all appear sane on the outside, but inside are all as dysfunctional as each other and joined by the fact that everything about them is a lie, is moving and a powerful tribute to the fact that it is possible to make classic movies in an era where it is one good film per thousand. The cinematography is good, especially with the interaction between normal film and home camcorder, the original score served its dramatic purpose (thanks once again to Thomas Newman) and the casting is inspired. Though the essence of the film is obviously not in its technical side, but in its deliverance of its central message. The narration of Kevin Spacey, who gets better in every movie he is in, carries us along the delusion and degradation of his existence and he wakes up to the fact that he does not like what he has become. His voice merely echoes what most of us either feel or have felt that we do not live up to what we saw for ourselves when we were younger. The harsh reality of it lies in that no matter what we do to try to obtain what it was we lost, we can strive forever but something will always get in the way in the end. Undoubtedly this film will make you want to get up off the sofa, switch off the TV and do something about yourself, and so it should. If we get one thing out of Mr. Mendes' masterpiece, it should be to live for the moment and enjoy your life."

A bit less money spent on it and it would be the American equivalent of the European movie, acutely observed, natural-seeming characters as they go about their lives - a bit like The Ice Storm.

"faornelas","10","0","0","6 February 2000"," An American Beauty! Look closer...
","Bought by Steven Spielberg for Dream Works Pictures, the screenplay of ""American Beauty"" was given to the British director Sam Mendes (this is his first movie) with just one condition: ""Don't change even a line"". Result: the movie is being acclaimed by American and international press  and, due to its favoritism (American Beauty is the winner of three Golden Globes: best screenplay, director and picture), it is being considered the motion picture that will probably win the Oscar for best picture of the year, in March 26th. ""American Beauty"" is one of those unusual motion pictures, that eventually come up to show that the  industry of American cinema is not restricted to commercial productions to be consumed by the public, without any sense of criticism. <br/><br/>It is a narrative, starring Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, that concerns the appearances of our lives, based on the relationship of an American family. What the movie try to and does demonstrate is that, in fact, nothing is what appears to be. (that is why the movie tagline ""... look closer"" makes sense) In ""American Beauty"", almost all the characters pretend or seem to be what they really don't are. All except Lester Burnham, the character performed by Kevin Spacey, who, with nothing to lose, do vanish all appearances, starting to behave like a teenager, as a try to escape from the familiar coma. Slowly, this brilliant story discard the apparent American beauty. There is no more American way of life, there is just life. And the beauty is found in the most ordinary thing of life. We just need to look closer. And this is the essence of the movie, this is what makes it special, an excellent American film, with excellent screenplay, direction and performances.<br/><br/>""American Beauty"" has many in common with the movie ""The Ice Storm"", specially for the way it depicts the family relationship: with coldness, lack of dialog, and conjugal crisis. Both pictures consist in a social critic to this institution, which is the family. The American family, to be more exactly. But that is all, because  Ang Lee's film is a serious story, full of metaphors, that takes place in the Nixon Era, a moment of changes in the social situation of America. ""American Beauty"" is a light film, which constantly sways between comedy and drama, and takes place in a suburb of contemporary America.<br/><br/>Hollywood makes history with ""American Beauty"", marking a time of turning its attention to more mature and better written scripts. Now, it is going to be perfect if the public accepts this new style of American movie and start to face cinema as an art and not a mere entertainment. So, take a look! We don't see a film like this every time we go to the movies."
"danielll_rs","10","0","0","5 February 2000"," Words are not enough to describe the beauty of ""American Beauty""
","As I've already said in many of my comments, the year of 1999 was really great for the movie history. We had the opportunity to see Stanley Kubrick's 'grand finale' (""Eyes Wide Shut""), an intelligent, surprising and twisted supernatural drama (""The Sixth Sense""), one of the most inventive comedies of the '90s (""Dogma""), a hilarious satire about ambitions (""Election""), a fast and exotic comedy about the 'generation X' (""Go""), the most enjoyable romantic comedy of the decade (""Notting Hill"") and even a wicked and fun teen flick (""Cruel Intentions""). There were other great films last year, including some that were not released in Brazil yet (as ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley""). But there was a certain movie, with a U$15 million budget, which stayed not only as the best of '99, but also the best of the '90s. Its name is simple and beautiful: ""American Beauty"".<br/><br/>I started admiring it some months ago, when it was released in the USA and the IMDb users elected it as the second best film of all times. At first, I thought that was quite weird: will a small film be better than true masterpieces as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" or ""Psycho""? This may be a little difficult to say, but the answer came last night, when I saw the sneak preview at a local movies. And the answer for that question above is:... Well, wait for my conclusion.<br/><br/>First of all, ""American Beauty"" is a satire. A satire about the society of the '90s, about the family, specially the American. What seems to be a happy family is nothing but facade. What seems to be a happy marriage is nothing but convenience. Everything is kilometres away from a perfect existence. But some facts will change the lives of these 'ordinary people'. The way as director Sam Mendes and writer Allan Ball turn all this into a dark comedy (a dramatic-dark-comedy, in fact) is really amazing. They're both geniuses, specially Mendes, on his direction debut. And pay attention at this: the movie can be resumed in a simple, ordinary phrase- 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder'. Mendes and Ball care for each character, and each of them has a great importance in the whole film.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey wonderfully plays Lester Burnham, a middle-aged man who lives his life without being cared for none, including his daughter Jane (Thora Birch) and his annoying wife Carolyn (Annette Bening). But one day he meets Jane's friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), and starts to be obssesed by her. While that happens, Carolyn gets involved with Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) and Jane falls in love for the 'psycho next door', Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), whose parents (Chris Cooper and Allison Janney) are an army coronel and an 'alive statue'. Spacey gives his best performance since ""The Usual Suspects"", and I see another Oscar on his shelf. Bening is in a wonderful, also Oscar worthy acting. The rest of the cast is worthy of as much recognition as the main couple, specially Bentley, Birch and Suvari, as the nowadays' 'lolita'.<br/><br/>Everything in ""American Beauty"" is perfect, from the soundtrack to the brilliant film editing. It has many memorable scenes, quotes, and wonderful images. It's difficult to say that it is the best film ever made if we take a look at Kubrick's and Hitchcock's films. But skip for the last line of the comment if you want to.<br/><br/>I could say many other things about such a complex film, but the IMDb wouldn't accept my comment for being so long. So make your Oscar bets, because this is surely best picture. I give you my hands...<br/><br/>My conclusion: ""American Beauty"" is cynic, wicked, funny, entertaining, disturbing, powerful, warm, brilliant, emotional, superb, wonderful -- The best film of 1999 -- The best film of the '90s -- And, in my mind, at least for some time... The best film ever made (!)"

","With all the hype and word of mouth surrounding this movie it would have been very easy to have gone to see it and then said 'It wasn't as good as everyone made out'. The fact is though, that it actually is, and on a personal level, possibly even better than that. What makes the movie so memorable, above the actual film, was the experience and understanding that this movie is about us. Not many movies can boast that but it was a movie that we can all relate to and all empathise with.<br/><br/>Look Closer, was the tagline for the movie and that is what is needed to experience this film in its true beauty. As well as the surface material which we see on the screenthere is always so much more going on outside of the action. There is such a continuos motion and speed to the movie that never lets up and this is what life basically is. It keeps going and going and before we know it we have lost so much time. Its the story of an (approaching) middle aged man who realises that he has wasted the last twenty years of his life and so decides that he is going to rectify his mistake and live the way he used to. That is the the story of the central character (Spacey), but what makes this movie so captivating is the numerous subplots which closely link to Spacey and his family. The subplots are not merely drawn in at the beginning of the movie and then resolved at the end. Instead they pop up throughout various stages and then are resolved on a natural timeline. The film cannot be sub-genred, it is far too detailed and unique for it to ever be labelled as a family-drama, or a black-comedy. The thing that the movie most closely represents is a soap-opera. However, should American Beauty and its story be put into a soap it would take a good 4 weeks or so to wrap up everything that happens. That is the films main strength, it does not lose itself amidst the mass of story which is taking place. The action is very sudden and the timescale realistic. Before you know it the end is upon you. The cast is fairly impeccable. Spacey can always be relied upon to give a solid performance, but this is his best work, probably ever. He illuminates off the screen and empowers every scene he is in. They say that the hardest roles to play are normal people and that is where the triumph is. He makes a normal person seem very real. Annette Benning plays off Spacey so well and leaves us wondering whether they are actually married. Chriss Cooper has a small but perfectly acted role and then there are the youngsters. Mena Suvari and Thora Birch play off each other with great naturalism and make their relationship very emotive. Then there is wes Bentley, a relative new-comer but a definite star for the future. His role maybe a close representation of him but the beauty he brings to the film is worth the two hours alone.<br/><br/>Look Closer but by all means just look."

","The title of this film really describes it. This film is almost flawless  I say almost because beauty is never perfect, but this comes pretty close. It's about the search for beauty amid modern dreariness, and how we tend to look in all the wrong places. But it can't be summed up in one line. It's a film made up of stunning formal elements  beautifully photographed, great characters, and a tight script that never flags despite the length. And magnificent acting. It's a nice example of how craft and art can combine to produce something more than the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>American Beauty borrows heavily from other arthouse films of the past  most notably Ang Lee's Ice Storm  especially in its style and characterisations, and if you've seen Ice Storm you can't miss the influence  and it's just as good if not better. It's a celebration of life as well as a heavy critique of modern lives and values. This is a team effort and everybody pulls together. Kevin Spacey is wonderful  he just leaves you wanting more. His minimalist style just suits this part  you need to probe beneath the surface, which is exactly what the film is about. Thora Birch as the confused daughter and Wes Bentley as her boyfriend with the secret of life are sensitive and subtle with their roles. <br/><br/>The only jarring note  the flaw in this beauty  is the curiously shallow character of Caroline portrayed by Annette Bening. Compared to the rich complexity of the other characters, Caroline is flat and predictable. We never discover what really makes her tick or how she lost her joylessness. She's just there to be a vehicle for her husband and daughter, which is a puzzle. She has none of the depths that Mary Tyler Moore's character played in Ordinary People, for example. Perhaps Sam Mendes wasn't particularly interested in the character. But it doesn't matter too much as the film is so good it can take a few sour notes. <br/><br/>This is a film I could watch again and again  and I can't wait  and still find more depths to plumb and more issues to think about without feeling I've been lectured about life, which so many other heavy-handed Hollywood directors do to their captive audiences. A light hand on the reins, as Sam Mendes has here, can produce a far better result. 8.5 out of 10."

It never lets up, every scene left me on the edge of my seat in anticipation of what would follow, and no scene failed to surprise or delight.

","In my opinion, ""American Beauty"" has got to be one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen.  In one instance, it is a cautionary tale on how to avoid a bad marriage.  On the other hand, it appears to be a cross between ""Ordinary People"" and ""sex, lies, & videotape,"" with shades of ""Sunset Boulevard"" and ""Rear Window"" thrown in for good measure.  While it's true Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, among others, give extraordinary performances as the troubled married couple, this is one film that makes you reflect on your own personal life while it tickles your funny bone.  And just when you think you know how the movie's going to end, director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball yank the carpet right out from under your feet.<br/><br/>Though ""American Beauty"" makes you think and laugh as you're watching it, it also disturbs your perception of American suburbia, similar to ""Blue Velvet,"" where decay is hidden within homes surrounded by nice, white picket fences.  ""American Beauty"" ultimately serves as a devastating wake-up call to all of us.  Not only must we return to strong family values, we also need to reach out to one another with genuine love and understanding. Moreover, in its own quirky, oddly optimistic way, ""American Beauty"" reminds us to work nonstop on keeping romance alive within our marriages, and to look for the wonders of everyday living, hiding in plain view before our very eyes. I give the movie an 8/10 rating.  It's not necessarily for the squeamish, and having an open mind BEFORE you watch it helps."
"Mike Sutton","Null","0","0","30 January 2000"," A breath of fresh air
","AMERICAN BEAUTY is a treat and such a breath of fresh air that it is bound to be overpraised. It's rather like a modern SAVE THE TIGER, with less sentimentality and none of the cheap melodrama. Sam Mendes's film also reminded me of THE ICE STORM in it's willingness to present complex characters and run the risk of alienating the popular audience.<br/><br/>
The story of the suburban man breaking free is hardly original, but it is given tweaks by the screenwriter, Alan Ball, that make it seem more daring than it is. I loved the dinner table conversations that slowly turn into pitched battles, and the device of the teenager who tapes everything is treated with sensitivity. The dialogue is constantly surprising and has a barbed wit.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey gives a great performance, but what else is new ? He's been giving great performances for the past ten years, even in slop like DAD, and he gave Pacino a run for his money in GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS. However, this is a brave performance because he lets us see inside the character and understand why he is doing the things he does. He risks being embarrassing, which is the risk all good actors need to take if they are to produce memorable work. Annette Bening is also astonishingly good, giving a witty and unsentimental performance as the mother from hell. All the supporting cast work wonders with the material, but Chris Cooper deserves special recognition for his heroically unforthcoming performance.<br/><br/>
Sam Mendes does superb work as director, capturing the mise-en-scene of suburban life with a promising eye for absurd detail. His best stuff is actually the beautiful dream scenes, and the achingly poignant shot of the bag being blown about in the wind. He also has a flair for comedy, keeping the camera moving for the gag. The heartbreaking scenes at the end, shot in black and white, are nicely done as well, stopping just short of saccharine sentiment. Conrad Hall's cinematography is as good as one would expect from such a wizard.<br/><br/>This is a film which kept making me laugh nervously, as I recognised bits of myself in the character of Lester, rather more than I would have wished. The final ten minutes are the most moving moments in a film since the devastating conclusion of WINGS OF THE DOVE. It's a brave, uncompromising film which treads familiar ground with enough originality to make it more than welcome. If it doesn't quite have the sharp edge of an independent film like, say, HAPPINESS, well ... you can't have everything."

","American Beauty is one the most outstanding directorial debuts of recent years, and one of the most beautiful, thought-provoking and human films to have come out of Hollywood in a long time. Narrated by Kevin Spacey's character, Lester Burnham, the story relates the melodramas, micro-dramas, and hidden inner lives of suburban America, culminating in an explosive climax.<br/><br/>Lester, at the start of the film, tells that he's going to die, so in one sense the film, as it approaches the end, becomes something of a whodunnit. But it's so much more. At the start of the film Lester is barely alive, merely going through the motions of his humdrum suburban life. Quite frankly, and by his own admission, he's a loser. However he's shaken out of his torpor by an encounter with the son of the new neighbours, Ricki, and the sight of his daughter's friend, Angela, with whom he becomes fixated. Overhearing a conversation between the two girls, he decides through sheer force of will, to become a different man - an iron-pumping, dope-smoking, employer-blackmailing übermensch.<br/><br/>This both shocks and disturbs his uptight realtor wife, who seems to have traded in the bloom of youth for security, a big house, and a front garden full of red roses. No longer able to bust her husband's balls, she finds her own diversions, forcing her and Lester even further apart.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Ricki from next door has captivated the younger Burnham, Jane, and struck a profitable relationship with Lester. But his Marine colonel father, a barely suppressed cauldron of violence and conflicting emotions, is watching him, and eventually jumps to the wrong conclusion, setting off the climactic chain of events...<br/><br/>American Beauty is almost perfect. Almost. My only qualm is with the death of Lester. We know he's going to die, but by the end of the movie we don't want him to, as we've come to love the guy for his beauty and humanity. He transgresses the rules of suburban life by striking out and going his own way. So is the film a morality play? Is Lester ultimately paying the price for not playing by the rules? Is the film adhering to another Hollywood convention? If so, it sucks.<br/><br/>Personally, I don't believe this is film's intention, but the result does mean supporting a conservative morality. This is a shame, because no doubt the Right will use the film to draw the conclusion that if you break the rules, you have to pay the price.<br/><br/>I don't think that I like the destination, but Lester and co took us on one hell of a journey."

","Sometimes you can tell how well a film is effecting its audience by the way that people respond in the theatre.  Moments of depth and meaning sometimes transcend the ability of those who lead a more pointless and shallow existence or who simply aren't paying attention. You can tell these people easily sometimes;  they laugh when they are not supposed to laugh because they are totally missing the point of what they are seeing;  and in this case a film so accessible and so understandable as this one further highlights the fact that they are sadly looking right past what they are seeing.<br/><br/>The packed cinema in which I saw this flim was such a place, there were pockets of these pointless individuals here and there;  people who totally missed the point of what they were seeing and saw only the surface of the fact.  That this happened in American Beauty really hammers home just quite how deprived these people were.  This is neither a difficult nor an obscure film, nor is it detached from its audience;  in fact it's a long time since I've seen something that was so immersive, so involving and so compelling. Indeed The Sixth Sense was a film of such quality but in a totally different way so perhaps comparisons are a tad unfair in this case.<br/><br/>This is a film of great depth, character and meaning which elegantly conveys its depth and communicates with its audience in a careful, considered  and very thoughtful manner.  This sense of depth is felt throughout the entire film and is cemented in the last few scenes, the point of the entire story is given with such clarity that it is hard to misunderstand what you are seeing.<br/><br/>I think everyone will perhaps pick up something different from this film based on how it relates to them and their own experience.  It will speak volumes to some, quiet whispers to others;  it will nudge and prod and suggest to some people who have been there, done that, others will just find it an interesting and deep story that stays with you long after you've left the cinema.  I think that the elegance of this film is in its simplicity and the way that a profoundly simple concept is explored and concentrated into the final point in the film, something that not only requires truly great writing but equally strong production, direction and last but not least, very strong performances.<br/><br/>I found all these things in this film and I was swept up in its brilliance, its simplicity and indeed its complexity.  Not only is it so clever as to be very intellectually impressive but it also achieves a level of accessibility that it may be understood by almost everyone.  I now pity those who miss this film or those who see it but still miss all that is in it;  those who want to look at pretty pictures and disengage their brain for a while had best not see this film.  They indeed have my pity.<br/><br/>
All I can recommend to you is two things.  Firstly go and see this film. And secondly ==pay attention==.  You'll be grateful that you did;  it's worth every moment that you give it."

","American Beauty is not about one person (Lester Burnham) - it's about everyone. We're all represented in one of the main characters - Lester represents midlife, his wife (Carolyn) represents ambition, his daughter (Jane) represents youth and his neighbours (Ricky and Colonel Fitts) represent wisdom and repression respectively. It's typical of this film that the wise character is a teenage boy (Ricky) rather than a wise old man. It's certainly *not* about a mid-life crisis - that's simply a vehicle to get a few laughs.  Lester's condition is terminal - and not some short-term crisis.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly superb but it's the direction and cinematography that really shine. This film is visually stunning. If there's a weakness it's the storyline. Really great films (like The Shawshank Redemption) have great stories to tell - and this movie doesn't... because the story is known to us all - most people are unhappy. But it's not a glum film. The movie's real message is that we don't have to be unhappy - the world is beautiful - the tagline should have been ""smell the roses"".<br/><br/>I like the movie more today than I did last night and I think I'll like it even more when I see it again. The two hours passed in a flash and I will watch it again and queue to buy the DVD when it's released. So it's a great film. But not flawless. I gave it 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if a young audience could relate to this movie since it deals with mature themes (relationships, happiness etc.).

","American Beauty is one of those films that comes from nowhere to completely surprise and delight the cinema going public. Sam Mendes makes his directing debut with a film that shows us American suburbia and its inhabitants in all their glory.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on Lester Burnham, a middle aged advertising executive who hits his mid life crisis.   Lester deals with this by quitting his job (and blackmailing his boss in the process), smoking pot and obsessing over his 18 year old daughter's best friend.<br/><br/>Much of this is documented on video tape by the son of the Burnham's new next door neighbours.  Ricky Fitts always has a camcorder with him and seemingly tapes everything.  His parents are a bit strange too.  His mother is always in a world of her own and his father is a committed United States Marine Corps veteran and, true to stereotype, is repressed, regimented and obsessed with discipline.<br/><br/>The performances are excellent , Kevin Spacey, in particular, is on top form and could well be in the running for an award this year.  Annette Bening is great as Burnham's wife, an uptight Estate Agent who ends up in the arms of one of her rivals.  Thora Birch comes of age in this movie with a mature performance.  She plays Jane Burnham, Lester's daughter, who is horrified to find her dad obsessing over her cheerleader friend (played by American Pie's Mena Suvari).  The rest of the cast perform admirably - Mena Suvari is the cheerleader vamp, Peter Gallagher plays the Estate Agent shark Buddy King, Wes Bently shows promise as Ricky Fitts and his parents are played well by Chris Cooper and Allison Janney.<br/><br/>Watching this movie, I identified with Spacey's character.  The urge to just quit your job and spend your time smoking pot, dreaming about your 18 year old daughter's school friends and working out so that you will ""look good nude"" has been kept in check for now - but for how long?"

Both preached a flavour of existentialist anarchism (anti-conformity, if you like) but in 'Fight Club' the message was painted with bleakness and masculinity, whereas in 'American Beauty' a rose was used to highlight the point.<br/><br/>Briefly though, I've seen very few movies that touched something within me and reassured me that my stance and ideas were worth living for. 'Dazed and Confused', 'A Clockwork Orange' and 'Fight Club' are about the only other really notable movies that have had a similar effect on me.

","I would define American Beauty (AB) as a documentary investigating American life as we enter the twenty-first century. Sam Mendes does a superb job depicting almost every major aspect of American lives, while ambitiously investigating aspects of society in a very successful manner. There are subtle and not so subtle implications throughout the film on topics such as relationships, employment, socialization, and violence- just to name a few. The relationships Mendes investigates are not all the same but cover a variety of differences, such as internal and external family relationships, and marriage. Mendes even gives us his cynical views of love through the actions of each of the characters.<br/><br/>Also intertwined in these issues are broader ideals such as living in a patriarchal society and the effects of commerciality and television. All the topics Mendes insightfully manages to address in AB contribute to what I believe to be the main topic here: The results of living in the modern capitalist society (as I was reassured of by a lady wearing a Mao shirt early in the film, as Carolyn Burnham [Annette Bening] stresses over her very competitive job).<br/><br/>The story of Lester Burnham [Kevin Spacey] offers us a view into the life of an ordinary man, but what many viewers don't realize (at least at the theatre I was in) was that the apparent humour was actually making comments on all of our own lives. I believe the film was very adeptly able to portray how disastrously many parts of our society have turned out. And in my opinion, the reactions much of the audience showed to this film exemplified their naivety to the world we are living in."

That the screenplay features cliches we have learned to accept as the movies' version of real people is negligible. In my opinion, they are all stock skeletons given haunting performances by a divine troupe of actors; skeletons save our hero Kevin Spacey, in a role I've rarely seen perfected on screen (admonish my noviceness if you will - I don't deny there are other such films - but breathe. This is simply one of them: and at the moment, I review it alone). That one role I know, because he made tangible what I thought to be an intangible feeling of instant simultaneous, despair and joy.. catharsis.. Despair at a bad thing: but rise above it by suddenly realizing how little what you thought mattered actually matters - maybe the pointlessness of your own life. You rise up laughing above the tiny clowns at your feet, those who ""don't get it"", that's joy: but still despair for their and your present sad state. and the emotion of feeling itself. The film is like a resplendent poem with words you heard elsewhere - but not together and not in the same context. Now some poor guy said in his review something to the effect of ""talks about beauty in everyday life. So what? What if we knew it already?"" The film might not be revelatory, but like I said it is necessary, like sparkles on the sea, or a bag on the wind to be noticed in passing, rare hints of a greater purpose. There is naught but simplicity here. The tag is misleading: do not look closer. Look no closer than the nose on your face. Thinking will get you nowhere. It is a very emotional movie with tendrils from logical thought. If you follow them perhaps you find religion. Empty the mind. Try feeling nothing at-all. Beauty in sparity. Hold the bag in one place in your mind and release it to let it drift. Think not. I repeat, look no closer than the bag. No: not what the bag means. You're looking too hard. Just bag on wind. Wind and bag dance and leaves scuttle. You won't be surprised at what you find when you ""figure it out."" That's the point. Some say that when you die - God is like an old friend. The beauty is the film is beauty is truth, a la Keats... and there is truth to be found here. To me this movie was like someone whispering, comforting, sort of like love, except it was from without, not within, more ethereal, more removed. Like watching the stars from a night-lit boat; or listening to it snow. If you've never done these things, I advise it immediately. The film is only tragic if you miss the hope splattered blood-red on the kitchen wall. I think it means death is inevitable, of course it is. Everyone will die: but it is natural. There is hope if we shake off human burdens at least occasionally and understand it is all natural. Please read my review and tell me what you think. And don't forget to see the movie."

","The story is back.  The only special effect that will never go out of fashion says Sam Mendes, the director of American Beauty, a sharp-edged triumph of direction, acting and story.  Here is a story about anarchy that resides not in the minds of terrorists, but in the lives of people whose every move is designed and calculated, people whose marriages are a sham, people who lack compassion and tolerance and whose lives behind their white picket fences are emotionally stunted.  Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a forty-two year old piece of damaged humanity who is married to an uncomprehending, neurotic wife Carolyn (Annette Bening).  They live in a pleasant, pretty house and have a daughter Jane (Thora Birch) , all gloomy resentment and dourness.  This may seem on the surface to be another dissection of the human condition but it is much, much more.  Sam Mendes has taken Alan Ball's script and crafted a film that is compelling and deeply moving and, ultimately, a complex and richly layered chronicle of our troubled times.  Into this world come the strange young man next door Ricky (Wes Bentley)  who has flashes of insight through his video camera and his parents Chris Cooper and Allison Janney) a retired colonel of the Marine Corps who harbours more than a streak of fascism and homophobia and the almost invisible mother who has all but retreated into her own personal Twilight Zone.  By the time the film ends, all these characters have changed and have made their escapes in one way or another but we as an audience have been deeply shocked and moved by what has unfolded.  This is a savage satire where the title of the film takes on different shades of meaning once you have seen the film and the repeated motif of red roses and rose petals take on layers of meaning that enhance and accent this story of a society in pain.  Kevin Spacey brings brilliance to the downbeat, sorrowful Lester and his infatuation with Angela (Mena Suvari), a high-school cheerleader, traces the course of his redemption as he begins to sort out what is and what is not important in life.  All of his attempts at ""self-improvement"" are pathetic but they are born out of clear, honest cleansing anger and rage as he becomes aware of his shortcomings - emotional and  physical.  Lester is one of the great characters of cinema.  Annette Bening's Carolyn, lacquered and hysterical, has an affair with Buddy (Peter Gallagher) in a deluded desire to soak up some of his success as a real-estate king and fails to see that her husband and her marriage are in danger of imploding.  Lester constantly imagines her the way she was when he married her but she is a long, long way from those times.  The household has moved from mere dysfunction to anarchy.  This film boasts some superb cinematography and editing - the wide-screen compositions are breathtaking - and  a satirical use of music to accentuate the images.  Incisive, intelligent and witty - an astonishing film  - a beauty."

He is our hero, as he is our powderkeg waiting to explode beneath a picture-perfect exterior.  Sex is the call to life, and that is what Lester finds: in the form of a sexy, young teenager - probably the first sexual fantasy of every young man's life.  From that point forward we are taken on his roller-coaster ride of being reborn; with new eyes, new courage, and humorous desperation.  Lester finds much more than he could see at the beginning of his path, and it is true Beauty.<br/><br/>This is a must in a collection!"

","American Beauty revisits the existential dilemma, the banality and absurdity of life.  Spacey faces the realization that life is meaningless, at least in as much as what he's asked of it, and takes drastic steps to react against that.  Camus or Sartres would have liked this film I think.  There is no true resolution, as there never is in these circumstances, and the ""meaning of life"" remains elusive, or rather hints that such a search is ultimately an exercise in futility.  Life is to be accepted for what it is, and lived accordingly.  If the mundane is pursued, the mundane is achieved.  A brilliant film..."

Then, on December 5th{I remember because I had the choice of this and seeing the senior class play at my high school for a second time,that was incredible. I'm very glad I choose this film, though},1999, I walked into the 6:25 of American Beauty with my friends. One had seen the film3 times previously, and his Girlfriend had seen it once. {note:I am giving you all these details to tell you how vividly this night stuck out for me} I was with him and his gf and my soon to be gf. We sat down, and the movie began. I was expecting a masterpiece..I got near perfection. My expectations were so high..It killed them all. The film just moved me. It made me shake,laugh,cry several times, and just love life. it made me see the beauty in everything around me. That was the night i asked the girl i was with out. The movie just made me realize the beauty in everything.

","This movie is one of the greatest I have ever seen, The characters are developed beautifully, and each line of dialogue, action, and even soundtrack has a significant meaning. Not since Kubrick's films has a film been crafted to the smallest details as this one. The tiny details, like the placed vase of roses, or the mother clutching the nazi plate after her family's facade is torn apart, made this film beauty itself. I also liked the hidden philosophy of ""marijuana = enlightenment"". It is obvious that the characters that have ""figured it out"" about life did so after hearty doses of pot. In fact, many of the most important lines of dialogue are spoken by characters when they are smoking. As with Angela and Jane in their car smoking pot, Angela points out ""everything in life that is meant to happen does"" and ""There's nothing worse than being ordinary"" major themes in this movie."
"NicolasC","9","0","0","21 January 2000"," What a surprise!
","I went to see that movie because it starred Kevin Spacey, who I consider one of the most talented actors still in the business. But, given it was produced by Dreamworks, I was fearing an over-production in the purest Hollywood fashion, and thus, waited for it to be played at a theater that offers $2 tickets.<br/><br/>I was wrong. Spacey was indeed awesome, and the performance of the rest of the cast was up to his level. The plot, albeit simple, sounded real. Of course, the subject is quite common: everybody knows that the weirdest situations don't happen in bad neighborhoods, but in middle-class families. And this movie is just an illustration of that, but definitely sounds true.<br/><br/>It's the story of a man's midlife crisis. And the subject is extremely well tackled. I won't say anything more, go see it. If Dreamworks starts releasing such movies, I might actually reconsider my position on the issue of Hollywood vs. the independent market.<br/><br/>My favorite movie of 1999, 10/10, and I'm usually harsh."

"DannyBoy-17","Null","0","0","22 January 2000"," A mess, but a fine, compelling mess
","This is not the best picture of 1999.  It however may be the most accessible picture of 1999, in that it tries to be cutting-edge and yet mainstream, cynical yet heartfelt, Todd Solondz and Frank Capra at once. Real-life suburban America is as pathetic as it is gorgeous, as shown by Ricky Fitts, a video-maker/drug dealer who spends his free time showing the beauty in what many do not consider worth a glance.  I know I was getting teary while I was in the theater, yet something changed once I left: American Beauty is very compelling, excellently shot (who is the cinematographer?), edited, directed, and acted.  However, it's also rather false/crude: it condenses way too much and ends up giving caricatures and surface in the disguise of poetic monologue instead of real depth.  The film settles for titillation with its overstepping of social boundaries when it could actually try to be provocative. <br/><br/>   You've probably read enough reviews to know the plot and the characters. All of them are pretty over-the-top, with the exception of Alison Janney as Ricky's mother, wonderfully absent in the film.  She perhaps says more about the life of a housewife with her line ""Sorry for the way the house looks"" than Annette Bening can in her incessant rage.<br/><br/>  Spacey is as always incredible, but there's something missing, or forced about Lester Burnham.  That last Kodak-like monologue reflecting on his childhood, the moments when he speaks nostalgically about college life and meeting Carolyn, even the way he says ""I'm great"" at the end, all seem very scripted, like a great actor striving to reach a character from a mediocre script.  OK- He's in a suburban daze!  Right, and he wakes up and remembers how good it was to be young cause he meets this hot chick!  And then he dies right when he's happiest!  Finally, he gets this great monologue about how great it was to be alive!  Raymond Carver, this ain't.  It's way too forced. <br/><br/>   It's worthwhile and certainly compelling, but the film shouts things in its dialogue that need not be SAID.  It contains crudely drawn characters reaching for a 3d dimension.  For me, the actor most transcending his lines is Chris Cooper, playing a truly repulsive human being who somehow ends up stirring you and making a lot of sense.  <br/><br/>  Again, the film is worthwhile, but not the best of 1999, especially if you consider the int'l market.  See All About My Mother for a film about the interactions of extreme/pathetic characters well-drawn out and excellently acted, Fight Club for a film that really deals with breaking out of the 90s shell, and The Dreamlife of Angels for the real beauty in the simple things. American Beauty is like a Reader's Digest edition of the three: worthwhile but only a rough draft."
"636","8","0","0","20 January 2000"," Kevin Spacey gives an Oscar worthy performance.
","I think anyone who enjoys an Oscar winning performance should see ""American Beauty"" because Kevin Spacey gives an Oscar worthy performance. His enigmatic smile and the twinkle in his eyes adds to the impact of the zingers he delivers with such adept verve that you can not help bursting out laughing. There have been many movies made concerning the male mid-life crisis but this movie does it more creatively. If you hate personnel management people (particularly the hired gun short term types) and would love to tell your employer where to shove your job then behold how Spacey's character does it. Who says that blackmail does not pay. It is even more hilarious when he applies for a job flipping burgers. The dinner scene when he explains how his day went to his wife and daughter is a classic. In so many of the films lately (Insider and Any Given Sunday) all the wife is concerned about is their upper middle class status and what the loss of income will do. As part of his mid-life crisis Spacey's character lusts after his daughter's friend. It is really touching how the climax of this relationship is handled. I was confused and disturbed by the ending of this film but there is no doubt in my mind that Kevin Spacey is solidifying his place as one of America's most talented actors."

","I thought the 'beauty' aspect of the film was kind of corny and that the movie would have been just as good without it.  But this film was excellent nonetheless.<br/><br/>It's almost a whodunnit, almost a comedy, and almost a tragedy.  In fact, it has elements of all of those combined and that makes it interesting.  On top of that, its almost Titanic in that you know from the beginning that Lester (Spacey) will die, but your interest never wavers.  You are given reasons to believe that any one of 5 people may kill him, and you are amused along the way.<br/><br/>The marriage depicted between Carolyn (Benning) and Lester seems quite realistic.  Carolyn has certain career goals and seems intent on making them at the expense of everything else.  She appears to be pleased to appear successful, regardless of whether she is or not.  Lester is unhappy at work and at home because neither is fulfilling.  Work is work, his daughter Jane (Birch) is in the awkward teenage years when you hate your parents, and his wife is not interested in him in any way until he tells her that he quit his job.  Then she gets very interested in the fact that his income will not be there.<br/><br/>All of this changes when Lester sees Jane's friend Angela (Suvari).  A teenage cutie who he finds himself fantasizing about.  Angela for her part is obsessed with the idea that she will become a model one day.  She likes the idea that men look at her and she brags to Jane of sexual exploits. When she gets the idea that Lester doesn't just see her as Jane's teenage friend, she plays with him, making provacative comments to see his reaction.<br/><br/>This is the setting and from here we're taken on an interesting journey that is quite funny and real.  It's not complicated or deep, but it is compelling.  Its hard to imagine anyone coming out of this one disappointed. I sure wasn't."

"moviebuffcole","5","0","0","13 January 2000"," A mixed-bag of much brilliance but also much condescension
","""American Beauty"" has been praised exorbitantly by both film critics and audiences across the nation. The time has come for a real assessment of this picture. The truth is, that perhaps the hype surrounding it has clouded how good it actually is. Do I think it's a bad picture? By no means. Do I feel it's a strong work, flawed by good intentions? Yes. Let's start off with the character of Carolyn, the burnt-out suburban wife who grows tired of the same-old life. She is played with gusto by Annette Bening. I think the role is written as a bit too much of a caricature to be as affecting as it's meant to be. Bening is memorable in a difficult role, but I do wish Mr. Ball would have taken greater care in making her seem like a woman, rather than a shrill schoolgirl. I almost think a slight bit of misogyny runs underneath this portrayal. However, this role is retrieved with the role of Janey, played by Thora Birch. She makes a sharp contrast to her mother, and perhaps is the way it's meant to be. I hope so. Then much of my hesitancy about the film will be quelled. Kevin Spacey is astonishing in a role both funny and feeling. He captures the innocence and the devastation life causes. He's a man who has become a puppet, and he wants revenge. Spacey is dynamic and quite amazing. The rest of the actors, with the exception to the underwritten Mr. Fitts, are all terrifically appealing. Another strong aspect of the film is its writing (excluding some minor problems in the structure of the conclusion). Alan Ball's screenplay is ribald and haunting, true and beautiful. Seeing it come to life on the screen is a tragic, moving experience, as is the film. Sam Mendes' first-time direction is never less than hynotic. The way he uses the camera and the widescreen is admirable. Every shot seems to be perfectly set, and somehow the camera is in tune to this cold, harsh environment. The direction is first-rate, and among the best of 1999. The first hour of this picture is among the finest I've seen. It's a stunningly biting comedy about suburbia and the hell it brings. Everything is told sharply, with the edge of a scalpel. Satire is wonderful if handled right, and boy is it. The only problem with the film is its climax, which feels a bit preconceived. There's a plot element, involving something using an Austin Powers-like gag that leads to misunderstanding, which sets the final machinations in order. Nevertheless, the ending works because we know it from the beginning. The plot comes full circle. Seeing the last 10 minutes of the movie were akin to an avalanche of emotion, most of them sad and eerie. ""American Beauty"", much more so than ""Happiness"", is a sad work, one in which there's no perfection to be had. The point is told well, and in memorable fashion. AB is a memorable picture in many ways. Anyone not in tears as the inevitable death is played out is doubtful to ever cry. The movie also doesn't force its emotions. It earns them through character observations. All in all, AB is a fine motion picture experience, even if I was a bit bothered by the mechanism that it took to get there. Grade: B+/A-. A fine, sad, penetrating picture. AB is flawed, but at its best, it's moviemaking of the first order"

","When I went into ""American Beauty,"" I expected something completely different; I thought it was just going to be about a man in the midst of a midlife crisis- something I could only relate to from an outside perspective. What I got, however , was a lesson in appreciation. A film which pointed out how much people take for granted. This film's themes has something for everybody, and I guarantee that if evryone let themselves go, and allowed ""American Beauty"" to influence and touch them, they would live better lives. You can't say that for many films.<br/><br/>Also, ""American Beauty"" should be called the ""ultimate teen film."" I say this because teenagers are the ones who should learn the most from Lester's experience throughout the film, and realize that there is SO much life can offer. There are even teen characters to relate to. Unfortunately, the reason why ""American Beauty"" isn't called the ""ultimate teen movie,"" is that the bulk of movie-going teenagers would rather go and see crap like ""Drive Me Crazy,"" and ""Cruel Intentions"" than actually learn something valuble about themselves. ""American Beauty"" is no doubt a classic, and will stand appreciated for years to come, owed without a doubt to Sam Mendes, Kevin Spacey, Allan Ball, and Wes Bentley."

","Yes, i managed to see American Beauty six times already.  Two screenings and 4 regular showings because here in LA it came out on Sep. 15th. and im going again as soon as my car gets out of the body shop. I actually scratched it a little when went off the road after driving from my 6th viewing.  The movie overwhelmed me so much and i drowned in my own thoughts about it that i didn't pay much attention to the road.  Now just don't think that the movie is dangerous, it's just me, but please go see it, you will laugh, you will cry, and then you will laugh again untill your eyes are red, your stomach hurts, and you're all exhausted with emotions because every single second of that movie brings some kind of reaction in you.  Depending on your taste, mood, and your own life story you will react differently.  As i noticed while in the theater, some people laugh, some gasp, some express other kinds of reaction and all at a different time, although there are more moments when everybody applauded and cheered than in any other movie i ever saw at the theater, and i see around 2 movies each 3 days. So if you ever want to experience something that incredible as you only imagined to yourself then go see American Beauty, it will be everything you expected and everything you didn't, it will make your head spin and you will forget about your body, your life, your feelings and problems and transfer to the lives of the characters for one hour and fifty eight minutes, it will suck you in and won't let go even after two or three nights full of dreams about the movie!!!  And each time you see it afterwards, it will become less and less funny and more of a lonely, sad story.  With each viewing a layer comes off and you can look deeper into the characters, something you missed last time, something that totally turns around and upside down your previous perception of the picture.  Oh, and if anybody reads this, then please, if you will have time, write another review and mention Ed-232 in it.  I just would like to see how many people my message got to.

But to me, it wasn't about that... the movie's about waking up, having your heart lead you and not having your career, your looks, or your money lead you. Lester Burnham used to live a very happy life that was alive with his wife and daughter, but somehow it disapeared through the mist of what a lot of us can relate to.<br/><br/>I think that all the performances in this movie were grade A.

It's that rare proof that big Hollywood studios are really able to make great and interesting movies if they set their mind to it, and for once give up the idea of making another big budget blockbuster with a lot of stars and a lot of explosions, but with a story that's too silly to be true! As far as I know this is the first really interesting movie made by Dreamworks, the studio founded by Hollywood's boy wonder Steven Spielberg and friends. The expectations about this ""independent studio"" were very high, but so far never came true. Now they finally do. This is the kind of movie one expects from intelligent film makers. It's all about a ""disfunctional family"", and all kind of strange things that happen to them in their suburban surroundings. At times it all seems a little too much, but eventually everything falls into place, and the film is never predictable. The storytelling of the narrative voice over brings back memories of ""Hollywood Boulevard"" ( without giving away too much about the plot). It's especially the movie of Kevin Spacey! He's simply fantastic, and on his way to becoming one of my favorite actors ( after for example his roles in ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""L.A. Confidential""). The scenes with him are the very best of this film, but the rest of the cast is also of very high quality. The film is beautifully shot, and has the wit of a good Woody Allen movie, and reminded me a bit of last years much praised ""Happiness""."

Wes Bentley shines in this movie as a cross between Boo Radley and Jimmy Stewart from ""Rear Window"". Thora Birch and Mena Suvari do a wonderful job, Thora as a typical teenager who is oblivious to her own beauty, and Mena as a self-absorbed teen model (which, by the way, I swear I went to high school with this character). Chris Cooper deserves many kudos for his potrayal of Ricky's father, Col. Fitts. Even Peter Gallagher was good in this movie. The cinematography is excellent, with colors made to both blend in and stand out. Many kudos to the entire cast and crew.

","My two-month high on life has been in a major funk this past week and ""American Beauty"" is just what the therapist ordered.  This spectacular, dark, funny film should be added to the best 100 films of all time.  This is filmmaking at its best and if you only see one movie this year, make it ""American Beauty"", it doesn't get any better than this.<br/><br/>Lester Burnhan (Kevin Spacey), 42 years old is in one hell of a major funk, even though he appears to have it all. A well paying job, a beautiful house along with a beautiful wife (Annette Bening) and a smart daughter (Thora Birch).  But deep down and really not that deep, Lester is dying inside with not much to look forward to.  Then two things happen in his life, he walks out of his soulless job and he becomes sexually fascinated with his daughter's high school friend (Mena Suvari).  Soon Lester is recapturing his youth and living life the way it should be lived.  He chucks his mundane existence for the happiness that he and all of us deserve, but of course like everything in life, there is a price to pay.  One of the characters in ""American Beauty"" says, ""You can't go around doing what you what, there are rules in life"".   Well, Lester proves that statement is wrong and thus begins his self-odyssey in this very funny, intelligent and relevant film. Lester is not the only character in the film to challenge that statement, but he is the only one who does it with such sheer determination, pleasure and joy.  Some critics have said that this is a film about suburbia and domestic life, but it only takes place in the suburbs and focuses on one particular family, this film go much deeper than that.  The heart of this film is about the walls and cages that we trap ourselves in that we think will bring us happiness, only to find out that they don't and that is the simple things in life, the beauty to speak of, that does it for us.<br/><br/>Every once in a while a film clicks completely together with the writing, directing, acting characters the whole kit and kaboodle.  Well, ""American Beauty"" is complete perfection.  There is not a false note or move in this entire movie, not one small weakness or flaw.  Director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball have put together a masterpiece on life in the last part of the 20th century and some of the best performances on screen this or any other year.  The wonderful Kevin Spacey's smugness has never been put to better use than here.  Hands down, this is the best performance by an actor this year, an Oscar winning performance period (don't even mention Jim Carrey in the same sentence).  Annette Bening has never had a better role or been this good in her entire career.  Just maybe this will put her back on the map other than as Warren Beatty's wife.  It is such an honest heart-felt performance as the unhappy wife who is dead inside, but just can't come to terms with it.  A high price to pay for all the material things that she thinks brings her happiness.  Thora Birch as the their daughter Jane and Wes Bentley as the odd next door neighbor Ricky Fitts are excellent, especially Fitts who has some wonderful moments on screen.  I sure hope to see more of this young talent, rather than the damn Leo kid.<br/><br/>I did say that the film had no flaws, but there is one tiny one I did not mention.  Eventually this movie had to end.  This year's best film, don't miss it or if you have already seen it, check it out again.  Highly Recommended. × × × × × out of 5"

","There is a moment in each great film when I know that I am watching something special and what was a pretty good movie becomes a great one.  I knew that `American Beauty' was a great film when Ricky Fitts, played by Wes Bentley, zoomed his camcorder lens past the shallow, seductive Angela (Mena Suvari) and onto the reflection of the deeper and more genuine Jane Burnham (Thora Birch).  That shot basically sums up the oh-so appropriate tagline for the best film of 1999, `... look closer.' The film never lets us down from there.  It challenges us with issues as far-reaching and deep as the true meaning of beauty and the struggle to find some worth in life, to simply how we, if we should, relate to our own children.  Even with all this baggage that would sink lesser films into excessive preachiness, `American Beauty' is never anything less than completely entertaining with its biting humor and rich visuals.  Kevin Spacey's performance is a masterpiece of nuanced understatement, just as Annette Bening is perfectly overstated.  Though we know from the first few minutes that the film is a tragedy, it does not make us any less sad when the inevitable climax comes.  If the ending is not entirely realistic, it is, in a deeper sense, entirely true.  `American Beauty' is `The Graduate' for the 90's generation."

From Wes Bentley's inspired monologue on the subject of Beauty itself, to the shot of the bag framed by the heads of the two lovers, to Lester Burnham's dream sequences of rose petals, this movie flooded me with beautiful images and ideas.  A story of suburban angst and disillusionment worthy of comparison to `The Graduate', coming from the unlikeliest source (Alan Ball, screenwriter for TV's `Cybill') and sublimely acted by Bentley, Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, Chris Cooper and Allison Janney, this film sparkled with an iconoclastic yet, in the end, gentle idealism that I have not witnessed since my favorite film of last year, `Pleasantville.'"
"vbz","9","0","0","28 December 1999"," Best Hollywood film of the decade
","Arguably one of the finest dramas to come out of a major studio since modern cinema's heyday in the 70's, ""American Beauty"" owes much of its style to a longlasting independent tradition - it's a veritable marriage of Todd Solondz's bitter, detached commentary in the guise of a sitcom-like comedy of errors, and David Lynch's subversive, dark visual poetry, rich in dreams and hidden meanings. And what a glorious marriage this is! Pure irony is juxtaposed with pure tragedy here in a fashion both funny and painful, since the first-time director and a noted stage veteran Sam Mendes permits the audience to actually get to know his characters well (something that most 90's filmmakers, Mike Leigh aside, never bother to do). Essentially, Kevin Spacey's post-mortem recounting of a crisis in two very different disfunctional suburban families, the film speaks volumes of about the trouble with the current American attitudes and social behaviors with surprising eloquence and complexity. Unlike its cynical predecessors who often just throw the wreckage upon us and then leave it be, ""American Beauty"" does offer alternatives to the widespread pursuit of happiness through financial success (meditation and aesthetic awareness ), all the while without succumbing to blatant, didactic posturing. No simple solution is offered, however: even the characters who manage to bring themselves closer to the noncoformist, more desirable state of being, achieve it through questionable methods. As close to perfection as the picture may be, a few inevitable flaws do creep in (a predictable, Hollywood score; a few cases of overstatement, when the plot carries itself a tad bit further then credibility would allow), yet none inflict enough damage to lessen the overall effect of this superior work that should serve as a wake-up call to a nation of self-deluding automatons."

The acting from Spacey and Bentley is some of the most inspiring acting ever captured on film and Annette Bening is astonishingly perfect as the eccentric wife.<br/><br/>The movie is a plethora of beautiful sights as the director Sam Mendes fixates your eyes to the screen in scene after scene after scene.

"Allan-14","10","0","0","21 December 1999"," As good as movies get
","What an achievement this film was! Perhaps the most interesting film I have seen this past year, it certainly tops my list as the best film of 1999. It is perhaps in my top 5 of the decade. Brilliant direction by stage director-turned film director Sam Mendes brings to life an intelligent script that is free of the contrivances that so many other films have offered as an excuse for intricately woven material. <br/><br/>Ever since ""Pulp Fiction"" ushered in a new wave of independent films (they're cheaper by the dozen it seems) we have seen one too many dozen bad excuses for an ""indie"" film; sometimes it seems they become more conventional than your typical Hollywood cop-buddy film: you know, a bunch of colorful characters who get together to pull off a crime, they wear dark clothes, they swear more than they actually converse, and then about 99.9 % of them die by film's end. Even Tarantino himself has secluded himself from the film world it seems, only occassionally taking part in a film production- maybe the impact Pulp Fiction had was a little imposing for him.<br/><br/>
And here we have Mendes' American Beauty, one of the freshest takes on the lives of ""everyday Americans"" I have seen. Kevin Spacey leads a very fine cast in this tale of an emotionally (and morally) bankrupt man whose family detests him. Spacey, through the crush of a girl less than half his age, manages to find new ways to redeem himself: he smokes marijuana and starts working out to lose that flab (sometimes both at the same time!). He even gets a very decent settlement from his employers, which leads to his buying a 1970 Pontiac Firebird... and a new job at a fast food joint he's been dying to work at. Now you gotta love a guy like this. <br/><br/>It is funny however, no matter how much you rave about this film, when people hear the story, there is always at least one eye brow raised. But forget those Hollywood anxieties. This Beauty is a blast."

The portrayal of the Marine father is such a cliche, it's almost embarrassing. Yes, by all means see this film; it is well worth the price of admission, but it is not a great film by any stretch of the imagination unless your personal film viewing history is very short.

","This is an amazing piece of work and it probably tops ""The Insider"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""EdTV"" and ""Bringing Out The Dead"" as my favorite film of the year. Alan Ball's screenplay is one the modern wonders of the world and Sam Mendes's direction matches it (I can see why he bested Michael Mann as the L.A. Film Critics director of the year). Where did these guys come from? This story of an American family and the tiny slice of the world they live in is unspooled before us with the precision and fascination of a geneticist unravelling a strand of DNA through an electron microscope. This is not to suggest that the film is cold (far from it). It just felt like I was watching the characters lives from beneath their skins. Rarely have I felt like I knew an entire cast so well. This will be a hard movie to reward at Oscar time because every single performance hit exactly the right key (""L.A. Confidential"" had the same problem), but obviously Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning should lead actor noms. Spacey has played laconic many times before (I can't think of a film where he hasn't been this way before), but not with the dry wit and comic timing he displays here. Even when he blows up it is dry. Benning has her best role since ""The Grifters"" and makes the most it. She is a Stepford wife with real ambition. They are a married couple who long ago gave up on the American Dream but are too comfortable to give up the Amercian Facade and this is Ball's key contempt. It is a very unique view. While the adults know that they are screwed up the kids still fight to have hope. It is their rebellion. Thora Burch is outstanding as the lone child of Spacey and Benning who is getting killed by her parents' cynicism. The most frightening performance is given by Wes Bentley as the next door neighbor kid who is constantly peeping and taping other people's lives, but also finding beauty amid the ugliness and chaos in some of the film's most moving scenes (a lot people will not get the significance and meaning of the paper bag, but those who do understand the film completely --I thought is was awesome). I think he is acting as the filmakers. Finally Mena Suvari is a revelation as the smart-ass and all-knowing teenage friend who reveals a heartbreaking vulnerability. This film is very dark but like ""Bringing Out The Dead"" there is a redemptive quality leaves you with hope at the end. I was floored by this. It is also a very funny film. American Beauty may be the best film of a very good year."
"GregRG","9","0","0","13 December 1999"," Lester Burnham has everything he wants, except a life
","American Beauty is the latest of films that attempt to dissect the vapidity and repression of suburban America.  It is also the movie that the others hint at becoming, a movie where the walls of repression have been stripped, and both the viewers and characters are left to watch the remnants of what remains.  Unlike Ordinary People and The Ice Storm, we see early and often the misery these people live with, and while Mary Tyler Moore remains ice cold throughout Ordinary People, Annette Benning and the rest of American Beauty have a complete meltdown before our very eyes. 	When the story opens, we learn of the tragedy that is about to unfold during the course of the movie, and we also see one of the most desperate characters in movie history, Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey).  On the surface, all looks well.  He has a good job, and a beautiful wife and daughter.  The problem is that he is despised by all three, and confides early on that he feels dead.  His wife (played by Annette Bening), a self absorbed real estate agent, is more willing than her husband to play the game of suburban respectability, but is clearly equally as miserable.  Benning plays this character so well that you completely forget how charming she was in The American President.  Their daughter (played by newcomer Thora Birch) plays typical teenage angst with such aplomb that it actually seems fresh and heartfelt on the screen. 	Each of the Burnhams enters into a relationship in the movie that helps each feel more alive.  Lester meets a teenage friend of his daughter, that ignites a passion in him that he thought has long since been dead.  Annette Bening's character meets her match in real estate king played by Peter Gallager, who is quite possibly even more self absorbed and greedy than her. Finally, daughter Jane meets an enigmatic boy next door, who films her every move, sells pot to her father, and has a homophobic, straight laced military father (Chris Cooper).  The ironic thing is that he is the happiest, most stable character in the movie. 	While these three romances ignite passion in the Burnham clan, they each highlight the vapidity of their alleged family.  This leads to some shocking and surprisingly funny scenes where suburbia goes under attack, to the relish of both the characters and the audience.  All this while Lester begins his mid life crisis.  He starts working out at the suggestion of his love object (Lena Suvari, as the sister's friend), quits his job and black mails his pension, and starts buying pot from his daughter's new boyfriend. While these actions are on the whole at the very least unwise, we see why Lester has made these choices, and we see his desperation turn to hope because of them. 	We also see some very interesting cinematic decisions being made, particularly with the color red.  It is used to highlight roses, lips, doors, and blood, and eventually we see that the red comes to mean beauty and hope for the characters, even in the final scene, when tragedy takes place. 	And the final scene.  Because we know the tragedy will happen later on, the question becomes how the tragedy takes place, and not will it.  The plot has a lot of fun teasing us with this information, and we are interested ourselves, until we reach that conclusion:  It doesn't matter.  Who eventually causes the tragedy isn't important.  What is important is that there are many characters desperate and sad enough to cause it.  When we realize that, we see what Lester sees.  We see the red as hope."

","This movie reminds you what movies at their best can do better than almost any other medium.  First, they offer beautiful pictures--what is a movie after all but a succession of images? Yes, story is important, but there are lots of ways to tell a story; a movie requires you to look at pictures. These pictures ought to be memorable, or else why are you bothering to go to the movies.  This movie asks you to appreciate the beauty of ordinary objects, epitomized by the movie within the movie of the dancing paper bag, and the beauty of people, not just the conventional pretty blonde that the Kevin Spacey character falls for, but also his daughter Jane, as in the scene where the neighbor kid's video camera moves in past her blonde girlfriend to focus on Jane's face. <br/><br/>Second, the best movies are about freedom.  Anything can happen in a movie; movies do not need to respect the conventional boundaries of time and space.  Characters should be believable and true, to draw us in, but they should also be capable of the unexpected.  They should help liberate us and show us life's possibilities.  We know from the beginning of this movie that the Kevin Spacey character is doomed, yet we rejoice in his liberation.<br/><br/>Don't be afraid to laugh at this movie, even though some of the scenes are grim, and none of the characters are particularly likeable.

Rickey is his alter ego, in fact all the characters can be seen as Lester's sub-personalities.  And the closeted gay man killing Lester is a powerful statement of what we all need to do to let our false selves and shells die.  Lester kills his false self and is set free for eternity.

Between the imagery and style of The Matrix to the gritty idealism found in Fight Club, not to mention several other films, I was sure that it couldn't get any better.  I was wrong.<br/><br/>American Beauty is such an immense and captivating film, the type where after you leave the theater, nothing from the movie felt awkward, no portion was unnecessary or gaudy.  I found myself just as intrigued watching it the second time as I did the first.  Kevin Spacey has proven beyond any reasonable doubt that he is one of the best actors America has to offer, if not THE best.  Although famed for his turns in Seven and The Usual Suspects, playing downright nasty villains, American Beauty shows that he can truly make an audience sympathize and pull for him as he portrays Lester Burnham.<br/><br/>
Meanwhile, Annette Bening should also easily be up for an Oscar.  I was amazed at how much she could make me hate her character, Carolyn Burnham, the perfectionist mother who is obviously frustrated with her lack of ability to apply her finishing touches on her husband and daughter.  Bening is blissfully oblivious as to how far apart her and her daughter have drifted.<br/><br/>Every character in the small cast performs flawlessly, including newcomer Wes Bentley, who plays the camcorder-obsessed Ricky Fitts.  Mena Suvari's portrayal of Angela Hayes, Lester's salvation that turns out to be, in a way, an illusion to him was much more enjoyable then her choir-girl outing in American Pie.<br/><br/>This movie impacted me so quickly that without hesitation I would easily consider it as one of my 5 favorite movies of all time.  This movie is flawless in its execution, and as Ricky would point out, beautiful in so many ways.  10 all the way."

","By the end of this film, I was so emotionly drained, I found it hard to walk.  True, this movie said things we already know, but even something we know is shocking and powerful when said outloud this bluntly.  Every single actor in this movie was wonderful, but all paled in comparison to the subtle and amazing  preformence by Kevin Spacy.  The plot twists around in so many unexpected ways, that it is impossible to predict.  So, maybe it's not the best film ever made.  It's still really good."

Sadly, those around him are so caught in their petty lives, they do not discover the secret of his redemption.  In a single moment, he grasps for the first time his true role as a human being, and before he has time to savor it, things take a tragic turn."

","There's something about AMERICAN BEAUTY that just doesn't do it for me. The cinematography is hands-down glorious and the acting is superb. Yet, there's too much dysfunction going on, it's a little cartoon-y. Or maybe that's what was intended.<br/><br/>After all dysfunctional families in film is certainly nothing new. Maybe that was what was so tiring to watch. <br/><br/>The film does have some great scenes of vengeance with Kevin Spacey screwing over his boss and coming out as some kind of hero or something. But the resolution is so pat and preconcieved.<br/><br/>Poor Chris Cooper comes out as a cartoon and Allison Janney's talent is wrongfully wasted as his wife. The confrontation between Cooper and Spacey was also a little eyebrow-raising. But I loved Wes Bentley in this movie, I hope this helps his career in the future (he was great competition with Spacey).<br/><br/>AMERICAN BEAUTY I think is too clean, too well cut for it's material. From the beginning you know the fate of Spacey's character, so there wasn't really anything to surprise you with (unless the identity of the murderer counts), so AMERICAN BEAUTY was sorta, dare I say, predictable. I guess I could say worst things. After all, it was very entertaining, very lovely, and very beautifully photographed. If only it was inspiring or gave us something new to watch, with such a grand production."

"joe-457","Null","0","0","29 November 1999"," good film, bad story
","This film was captivating and well-made, the acting was exquisite, but the overall message in the film was quite disappointing.  The story is filled with characters who test the boundaries of morality and never seem to find any value in their own lives.  Those who do find a reason to live actually find nothing but faith in mysticism, marijuana, and the afterlife.  There are many themes in this film, but the one that insulted me the most was the constant jabbing at capitalism.  Corporations are evil; materialism is for the soul-less; greed leads to the decay of morals.  The filmmakers have surely read the Bible; their world is just as sinful and hopeless as the one which Christians presume to live in, and their only salvation is in life after death.<br/><br/>I do not wish to trash this film, for it was actually very entertaining. but in the end, quite disappointing.  I just wanted to remind all of you out there that there is no such thing as original sin, and that money is not the root of all evil; it is the root of the pampered lives that all of us Americans enjoy.  However, if you enjoy movies which try to make you feel guilty and hopeless, then American Beauty is for you.  I, however, would prefer to see movies which make me proud to be a hard-working human being who finds happiness in creativity and industry, not in God and marijuana."
"NickD","Null","0","0","30 November 1999"," A beautiful film about nature, human and otherwise
","This is a remarkable and surprisingly touching film about the masks we all wear -- the faces we present to our families and the world to hide our insecure and vulnerable selves. Although exaggerated for effect (and to address logically in a 2-hour movie), the relationships in ""American Beauty"" are as complex as any in life. And while the catharses that most of the characters undergo are a bit overly contrived, the truths that the film puts forth -- among which is that the joys in life can be found in being true to one's own nature and in nature itself -- are amazingly potent. This is a beautifully directed, photographed, scored and acted film -- everyone concerned does a masterful job. Much has been said about Kevin Spacey's performance -- it's great -- but I was particularly impressed by Wes Bentley as the film's ""control subject"": the one character who is honest in his actions and emotions, a boy to whom the whole world is an amazing spectacle. Yes, ""American Beauty"" is popular mass entertainment, but even within that often constrictive form it is a true -- and memorable -- work of art. I think its stature and regard will grow over time."

","I am glad I went to see this without knowing anything about it. I had rushed to the multiplex for a little time alone (my wife was busy) without having done any movie homework. I ran into a really old friend (nursery school!) who was waiting to meet a friend and see American Beauty. Neither of us knew anything about it, but she said she had read good reviews and I know her as a serious person with pretty good taste.<br/><br/>I left this movie laughing the deep, ecstatic laugh of the crazily fortunate.  I have only been hit like this once before: The Unbearable Lightness of Being.<br/><br/>I was in a state of bliss for several days afterward, and my only question was how can I learn to make something that beautiful.<br/><br/>People have compared this to Fight Club in terms of its anticonsumerist wakeup call message, and I agree as far as that goes.

","After reading the reviews for American Beauty, I thought ""It sounds good but can it really live up to the exemplary ratings that it received?""----Yes, it can.  I was skeptical at first--not sure if it would leave me awe-struck as it did for so many in its opening weeks.  American Beauty has a way of pulling you in--making you live the plot with characters--experiencing their smiles and tears.  It teaches you that beauty is all around you and it is up to you to see something for what it really is, through your eyes alone.  Its about finding happiness and love in a point in your life when everything seems to be in an exponentialy-growing, downward trajectory.  I was lucky enough to see American Beauty before its fame (my theory of its projected fame) hits the entire country.  If possible, try to see it before you hear anything more about it.  All of the actors/actresses are incredible--my favorites are Kevin Spacey and a tie between Thora Birch an Annette Benning for actress.  Don't get me wrong--I didn't think that there was a bad or even mediocre actor/actress in the entire film.  My only regret is that I don't have the means of writing an astounding review for this awesome film--I just don't have the words.  My semi-pedestrian comments are no match for the excellence that the movie achieves.  Everyone who sees it will take something different away with them when they leave.  So see this film as soon as possible and be ready to laugh, cry(in some cases I'm sure) and see it again."
"BIGROD","8","0","0","26 November 1999"," Very Good but not Great
","I saw this film a couple weeks after it came out and I agree with most people that it was worth the $4.50 that I paid to watch it, but I don't think it is so revolutionary as some may come to believe and it definitely is not worth the #2 rating all time it has for IMDB users.  It was good, but right behind the Godfather, I don't think so.<br/><br/>I think the reason that this film has had so much widespread acclaim is that it is one of few films that gets talked about that actually is different from the rest of what gets widely played these days.  I've had HBO and Cinemax a good part of my life and have seen a number of films that haven't seen the theater, but are good films that tell stories about what could actually happen to real people, who talk about the thoughts and problems we all have.  A movie that comes to mind immediately is the Pompatus of Love which is another different movie about relationships.<br/><br/>I think the best thing about American Beauty was how it showed a seemingly perfect family's dysfunction played out perfectly by lead actor Kevin Spacey.  I wish more actor's would take chances and play people in NORMAL situations instead of always playing people in these fantasy worlds we know are far from reality."
"tetzel1517","10","0","0","26 November 1999"," Best of the Decade? An understatement.
","Warning: somewhat subtle spoilers ahead. I have just returned from seeing this movie, and am still in awe. Granted, I'm in awe after seeing quite a few movies, but the important thing here is that that feeling has not faded the slightest bit since leaving the theatre. Not only do I want to see it again, but something in me tells me I NEED to see it again. Kevin Spacey solidified his status as the best modern American actor with his incredibly complex, yet totally convincing portrayal of Lester Burnham. A Willie Loman for suburban America, Lester is one of the best acted and written characters in years. Now that I have my Spacey praise in, on to the film. This film (the word ""movie"" is an insult here) is simply the greatest study in insecurity and hiding I have ever seen. Every character has a trademark insecurity that they constantly try to get over. This film is about these characters fighting against their insecurities and trying to grow beyond them. The metaphors for hiding are of the quality of a classic novel -- from the use of clothing to dinner plates to video cameras. American Beauty is, in my opinion, The Great American Tragedy. In fact, it is a tragedy right up there with Shakespeare's best. A man, in his quest for liberation from his insecurities, brings about his own demise. His pursuit indirectly inspires others to do the same. Their futures are left in the air. We can only hope for these people (yes, this film is so good you actually CARE about the characters as though they were real people) that they succeed, because after all, we see a little bit of ourselves in each of them. And finally: I'll never look at a bag blowing in the street in the same way again. A work of art. A perfect 10."
"EThompsonUMD","8","0","0","26 November 1999"," Familiar tale, entertainingly told, but no masterpiece.
","I was tempted to give this movie a lower rating than it actually deserves (about an ""8"" I'd say) just to help bring it down from its ridiculously lofty IMD perch as the second greatest movie ever made. Having just watched the DVD releases of Joan of Arc, Chinatown, and Grand Illusion, I would rank American Beauty as maybe the fourth best film I've seen in the past week. Is it a good film? Yes. Is it worth the extraordinary hype it has received? Certainly not. The cinematography is excellent (as one might expect from Conrad Hall, the cinematographer of In Cold Blood, Butch Cassidy, and Cool Hand Luke among other truly great films). The script has some clever turns and some wonderful black humor. And with Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening for starters, the casting and acting is first rate. However the story and its themes are painfully familiar, bordering on the clichÃ©d. Maybe the studied allusions to other movies (e.g. Sunset Boulevard; Sex, Lies, and Videotape) are intended as clever post-modernism (i.e. the film is really about earlier films), but most audiences seem to think the film is making some great statement about the sterility of contemporary American family life.

","My God! For all the positive press ""American Beauty"" has attracted, it certainly struck me as an elaborate series of defiant set-ups, with Kevin Spacey as the one who gets to dispatch all the straw men. He finds work dehumanizing, so he gets to ""tell the truth"" in his job evaluation, then blackmail his employer for a year's salary for his severance. He finds his wife's obsessions with materialism intrusive and suffocating, so he jerks off while she sleeps, and rants about the furniture and their bloodless marriage. He later gets her under his thumb when he catches her in an amorous embrace with another man...<br/><br/>The only graceful note in the whole tirade, is that he DOESN'T f**k the nymphette, who miraculously transforms into a vulnerable woman/child.<br/><br/>Hey.

"Cinewolf","10","0","0","22 November 1999"," An American Masterpiece of Originality
","American Beauty is a small American masterpiece.  Director Sam Mendes aims dead center into the bitingly funny, dark and confused hearts of two parent and child sets entwined together somewhere in SUV-land, with devastating consequences.  The film's narrative offshoots revolve around Kevin Spacey's transitional quest to wrest joy and meaning from the vacancy of his life through an obsessive preoccupation with his daughter's alluring cheerleader friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). Waking up, searching for meaning and taking back your life can be a deadly business.<br/><br/>One quickly recognizes the misplaced dreams and ideals in Lester Burnam's(Kevin Spacey)sleepwalk through a manicured life alongside his controlling and abusively compulsive wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening). Roses become a metaphor for both confinement and for spiritual liberation. Sizing all of this up, daughter Jane (Thora Birch) leases her existence between these pathetically incapable child-parents with contempt and longing for some way out, if she just only knew what is was.<br/><br/>The emergence of newly moved-in next door neighbors completes a head-on collision with sexual yearnings, lies, truth, and disaffection -- much of it watched through the camcorder lens of the new neighbor's son, Ricky (Wes Bentley).  The neighbor, Marine Corps Colonel Fitts (Chris Cooper), wages war on his marginalized and broken wife, Barbara (Allison Janney) his drug-dealing son, and ultimately himself.  Ricky's camcorder brings it into pinpoint focus one dark, fearful, tender and revealing night.  Through it, Ricky drinks in the unseen and momentary beauty within an often painful and ugly life.  To be ""ordinary"" is to be dead, and at the right moment, being dead can evoke God's steady and unblinking gaze looking back through the camcorder lens.<br/><br/>American Beauty is integrated along every edge of the production seam. Director Sam Mendes left little to chance.  Good dark comedy films are easily vindicated when the dark and funny elements weave effortlessly back and forth.  In American Beauty, they are so integrated as to be nearly indistinguishable.  These days, an audience is grateful for an honest arrival to the optimum moment in a story, even if it knows what is coming. This film repeatedly rips viewers from comfortable expectations, bringing them much closer the heart of important moments -- leaving them as surprised and emotionally swept up as the film's characters find themselves<br/><br/>American Beauty is a visual story splendidly complemented by the brevity of its dialogue.  The camera is not merely present to reveal a story but part of the story itself. The characters are facile, funny, moving and wretched. Annette Bening keeps the comedic tones of her character intact while revealing an underbelly of fragmentation and a need for control as expressed in the furious pursuit of material success.  Benings's potentially Oscar worthy performance is capped in a scene in which her character viciously berates herself after an all day effort to sell a house ends in failure. Spacey's performance is a steady centerpiece to which all other characters and narrative elements launch and repeatedly return. Wes Bentley and Thora Birch team-up as counterpoints to Bening's and Spacey's empty existence by seeking some measure of the meaning eluding both their confused and destructive parents.<br/><br/>American Beauty is perhaps the most unique, creative and affecting film since Pulp Fiction and arguably the best American film of 1999."

","American beauty is about an American family, the father, the mother and the teenager, who lives in a big house.  The father, Lester Burnham, is tired of his boring life.  His wife does not make love with him anymore, he has a problem with his troubled teenagers, etc.  One day, he falls in love with his daughter's best friend.  Every night he has erotic dreams with her in a bath full of roses, for example.  And he will start to do some exercise to shape his body.  And also, there is a new neighbor who likes to film beauty, etc.  Well a lot of things happen in this special movie.<br/><br/>I have to say that the story is totally original in his development and in his story itself.  The way it describes an American family and its neighborhood is very interesting and funny and tragic.  The first part of the movie is funny and captivating.  The end is shocking, excellent, and very sad also.   This is definitely not a conventional film.<br/><br/>
The characters are extremely good and realistic.  In the first part, Lester says that his daughter is a cliché teenager, but we see that she is more than that, more complex.  It is the same thing for the mother, who seems totally crazy and hysteric.  Every character is well developed during the movie.  At the end we are attached to all of them, even the superficial roses girl.  The interpretations are so good that I think they are the most convincing I've seen this year.  I could say it is normal because the movie director worked in theater where the interpretation is the most important thing.  Well, Kevin Spacey (excellent like always), Annette Bening (Funny and marvelous),  Thora Birch (Surprisingly good, there was a long time that I have seen her in a movie) make this movie one of the best of the year.  It is provocative, hilarious and so sad.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes is incredibly talented.  He id a great job with all the actors. He knows how to directed people and we can easily see that in the film. Also,the images are beautiful, powerful and shocking sometimes.  He knows what to film and how to film it.  I can't wait to see his next film because he his very impressive.<br/><br/>This is a movie that stays in the skin for a few weeks.  The story is haunting, strange, realistic and original.  It shows things that we do not see a lot of times in American movies, and this is a good thing.  Nothing is cliché, there is no judgment on the character and it makes me feel good. The wife cheated on his husband, he loves his daughter's best friend, their neighbor are gays, the others are a drug dealer, a military man and his special wife, and we do not hate them,  I don't hate them.  Everything is important in this movie, it shows, I think, what is  American beauty, and this is not necessary a good point of view.  The end is not unpredictable but for a part yes.  I thought that this movie was playing with clichés about who will die, why and who will be the killer, and everything else, that's how I can explain the beginning. <br/><br/>Well, It's now one of my seven favorite movies and I will see it again because it deserves it. 10/10  a masterpiece."

","American Beauty is a very very good movie.  One of my favourite sayings is that 'perception is reality'.  This basically means that most of the problems that people have are really just caused by the way they see the world.  For me, this movie is full of people who have a variety of problems because of their distorted views of the world and the people around them.  I found this to be summed by Colonel Fits when he says to Lester ""I seem to have got the wrong idea"".  Too right, but he is not the only one.<br/><br/>A good central theme does not alone make a great movie.  American Beauty also features stunning performances from Spacey and Bening, supported by a superb cast playing a host of larger than life suburban weirdos.  The cinematography is also fabulous as you'd expect from Conrad Hall.<br/><br/>My only gripe - why did the films' title have to feature the word 'American'?<br/><br/>Well done Sam Mendes.

","I was somewhat surprised that this film is ranked #1.  I don't think it's THAT good, but certainly one of the best film of this year.  However, it does fall shy of last year's HAPPINESS, which it resembles in some ways. The lead acting by Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening is nothing short of perfect, as are the supporting roles.  Spacey plays a burned out yuppie, strangely remniscient of the Edward Norton character in FIGHT CLUB, who's tired of his job, his wife, and his life.  That is until he meets his daughter's pretty Lolita-like friend.  Bening is a real estate agent who will do almost anything to get ahead.  There are also some strange neighbors who move in next door.  These plot threads overlap and intersect each other, leading to the inevitable conclusion.  This film is a remarkable achievement in part because the writer and director are both making their debuts here, and it's possible they might walk off with Oscars in March.

I am a huge film fanatic and it is not often that a movie will surprise me.  This movie did.  I never knew what would happen from one second to the next.

Every element of this film is perfectly measured and portioned. The comedy and the tragedy work well together.  WAR OF THE ROSES meets FARGO somewhere in middle America.  Stunning. Provocative.

","American Beauty is a very interesting film in my opinion.  I will discuss the plot and ending, so don't read if you don't won't to hear about the ending.  To put it simply I like this movie.  I look at films as nothing more than a form of entertainment.  Sometimes there are exceptions to this. This film had the feel of one of these.  I loved the idea behind the movie, an average middle aged man has his rebirth and regains his youth.  Kevin Spacey's character desides on day that he is feed up with being a good man and getting nothing in return.  It takes the meeting of a somewhat unusual young man.  He follows this kids example and decides he is going to do what he wants.  He ingeniusly gets $60k from his company and quites.  I love that, the balls that guy shows.  Then he goes home and tells his wife how shit is, loved that part.  To top things off he gets a car he likes, a job he likes, and starts exercising to improve himself.  These actions are the things that stick out most to me.  All of which show what teenagers are supposed to do, have fun.  Kevin Spacey's character shows how important that this is.  Well I have never done this and am tired of writing so see it and make your own opinion I guess."

","This is perhaps one of the most original dramas to come out of a Hollywood studio in a long, long time, and as a result it almost fails in it's desire to be audacious. In trying to pick apart the myth of happy American suburb life, the characters and situations are so completely striking it almost is unbelievable. As the masks of each character fall off it almost brinks on absurdity. But thanks to powerhouse performances by Kevin Spacey (who will get nominated and probably win Best Actor) and Chris Cooper (who should get nominated, but probably won't, for Best Supporting Actor) and a tremendous directorial effort by Sam Mendes the film is indeed a triumph.<br/><br/>Lastly, it might be best to arrive at the film five minutes late to skip the opening narrative which for some inexplicable reason gives away the powerful ending, which would have been more effective if hadn't been given away two hours earlier.<br/><br/>If you liked this movie, see Happiness, which covers the same ground, but I think much more effectively."

American Beauty is presented to it's audience with near perfection.<br/><br/>(SPOILER ALERT) Had the film not started out with the videotaped conversation of his daughter, this film would be a perfect example of what great film making is.

","""Look Closer"" the trailer quietly teased moviegoers for months.  Well, last night I did---and I loved what I saw.  I had high expectations going in to see this movie.  As I had read in the various movie magazines:  It's an Oscar contender, Spielberg claims its the best movie he's seen in years, first-rate cinematography, yada yada yada, blah blah blah, so on and so forth.  Drama has never been my cup of tea.   I never bought into the whole ""Shakespeare In Love"" hype--a movie that most people claim to love, but rarely go see a second time.  And, I thought the Ice Storm was boring.   The Piano?  Give me a break.  Well this time, I have to say I was won over. Like the others, in a packed theater in LA, I was surprised at the in your face comedy and the larger than life characters.  Kevin Spacey was sensational, Mena Suvari a dream come true, and a cast that's just first-rate.  It's an incredible script made by a director who knows what he's doing.  But, the film's not for everyone.  At certain points of the movie, I can see how some people who were raised on Disney Films could be deeply offended by the subject matter.  I wasn't.   After sitting through countless movies this summer where I could pretty much predict the turning points, crisis/climax, and the cookie-cutter resolution, I was dying for something... I dunno fresh, well-thought out, really good...  <br/><br/>
If you want to see something safe, go see Runaway Bride, but if you want something absorbing and just flat out funny then this is one for you.   My final analysis of the film:  It's flat out the best movie of the year--I'm saying this keeping Sixth Sense and Bowfinger in mind, which will also go down as some of the great films in cinematic history."

The rest of the supporting cast (namely the 'kids') were strong and added greatly to the overall skill factor in this movie.<br/><br/>I was a little uncomfortable with the nudity and overtly sexual nature of the two female teenagers, but since it's life in all its blemished glory, one really can't complain. I must admit to squirming a little at seeing teenage nudity. I'm not normally a prude, but this was maybe just a little too much for me. But then perhaps that was the point. I have no desire to see young girls/women getting deflowered/fantasised over. Smacks to me of a little paedophilia that is definitely *not* necessary.

","WOW!  That was the only thing I could say about this movie for days.  It was the only thing I could say about anything, because I was so engrossed in the story, still thinking about the things it revealed about life.  Every now and then I hear the theme music playing in my head, and think about the beauty of a simple leaf as it is blown to the ground.  This movie changed my life.<br/><br/>And now to those who would pooh-pooh this movie, I say to ""look closer"". People have missapplied the tagline, thinking that it is speaking about the plot.  The plot is perfectly possible, everything that happens could possibly happen.  However, people are suddenly on this reality hit.  If they haven't seen something happen, then they don't believe that it can happen. People call this movie weird, they think that it is degrading or insulting towards women, they think Ricky Fitts is a jerk just because he is a drug dealer, they flat out don't get it!   People are so caught up in what they think they know about characters, that they don't realize the subtle hints to surprises that come later.  It is because they don't ""look closer"" at these people that they find this movie ""weird"" and don't understand the underlying motives.<br/><br/>Let's take Colnel Fitts's repressed homosexuality.  His earlier comments about homosexuals, if taken at face value, totally belie his later actions. That is what makes his kiss with Kevin Spacey totally shocking.  However after this action takes place we ""look closer"" at his actions you realize that his grandstanding against homosexuals was a smokescreen to cover his hidden homosexual tendencies.  Same thing occurs when you find out Mena Suvari's character is a virgin after she has bragged about having sex with thousands of guys.  She is bragging to cover up her embarrassment of how ""ordinary"" she is.  Also if we look closer at her we realize that while she is (as Ricky says) totally ordinary, we also realize that through the eyes of Kevin Spacey who ""looks closer"" at her, she is anything but ordinary. Even in the bag that Ricky taped we hear the movie's message.  At a glance it is a plastic bag being tossed around by the wind, but if examined closer it is a beautiful metaphor for the life of a human.<br/><br/>Those who do not like this movie should realize that they are the subject of the satire.  Alan Ball is making fun of YOU!!!  Those of you who do not see the beauty in dead things, who like to fire guns and listen to tapes based on ""me-centered livng"", those who live their life in a catatonic state, those who are so caught up in their jobs that they forgot to be happy.

I didn't buy what I consider to be the basic premise of the movie, the lusting of Spacey's character toward his daughter's teenaged friend.  It seemed like a minor plot device thrown in at the last minute, but the entire movie centred around it and Spacey's increasing disenchantment with his life.<br/><br/>I laughed a few times, but those times were few and far between.  At least I made it through the entire movie, though.  A friend walked out of the theatre half-way through, completely bored and preferring to go for a walk instead.<br/><br/>I found myself begging (silently) for at least a nude scene or two once I realized the movie wasn't going to be to my liking, but even those seemed contrived and added as afterthoughts to the screenplay.

","""American Beauty"" is a most remarkable amalgam, combining powerful elements from a number of well-loved films. Fans of ""Lolita"" will immediately recognize the tortured agony of Kevin Spacey's character, drawn like a moth to a love than can never be. There are shades of gritty movies like ""KIDS"" and ""Fun"" as the younger members of the cast struggle on the edge of their developing lives. Finally, Annette Bening's shrill Mrs. Burnham might remind some of the loose cannons ""Thelma and Louise"", attempting to get her life together while having neither the ability nor the intelligence to do so. As one writer once said about ""KIDS"", ""American Beauty"" is a film that remains riveted to the viewer's consciousness long after the credits roll. The agonizing monotony of suburban life--from which there is no escape. The torture of a human being caught between his public persona and his true self. The onset of youthful sexuality. Each incendiary element combines in ""American Beauty"" to form an unforgettable tapestry. Sombre though the premise may seem, there are some wonderful light moments. Mena Suvari offers a funny and most refreshing take on sexual objectification in one of her monologues. Even more hilariously, Thora Birch obsesses about her breast size and saves her allowance for augmentation--ironic considering the character she played in ""Now and Then"" was similarly concerned about her cups, even filling balloons with vanilla pudding to augment her bust. One or two problems plague the script: Kevin is inextricably drawn to Mena, yet no attempt is made to challenge the tired Western stereotype that adult man cannot love teenage girl. And the ending of the film suggests a punishment that does not fit in with the overall message of the movie. However, all in all, ""American Beauty"" is a treasure of a film and a must-see. And even if you don't like films that make the viewer think, Thora and Mena doff their tops, making everything worthwhile."

That there is some fundamental force that is a part of all of us, and we can tap into it.  When we die we do not cease to exist, but are somehow transformed into some other energy that is at base connected to this universal fabric. We need not fear.  This `benevolent' force will always be there and if we tune inmaybe, just maybe we can experience it in all it's wonder and beauty.

","This has been a good year for original movies.  Movies such as the Blair Witch (which I didn't enjoy, but is original nonetheless), the Sixth Sense, and Fight club are all movies that deviate from the norm.  American Beauty is no exception.  It is refreshing to see a movie that portrays the ""Typical"" American family in a realistic manner.  I do not want to delve into the plot, for that would give away the essence of the film.  What I can tell you is that you must pay attention; Do not see this movie simply for entertainment value, but bear witness to the message the movie is attempting to convey. Kevin Spacey offers an astonishing performance.  His supporting cast is not exactly world renown, but they do a good job nonetheless.  This movie is a must see for anyone who considers themselves an avid movie goer, or for anyone who simply wants to see a phenomenal journey through the mind of a typical, suburban male."

","This movie is the second movie of the year to bring tears to my eyes, the first being ""The Iron Giant.""  This is a very difficult and emotional movie that I highly recommend to everybody.  The movie is more about the characters and their eccentricities than anything else.  Kevin Spacey does make the movie, though.  It is very real, funny, sad, and tangible.<br/><br/>Acting- Top of the line.  You actually believe that Kevin Spacey is pulling himself out of the rut, and going through his mid-life crisis.  You believe that a woman like Annette Bening can be so vapid and empty, while finding her happiness.  Everybody acts the way that they are supposed to.  But, the shining star was Wes Bentley as the next-door neighbor.  Although I think that the video helps him to remember as well as to hide from the real world. Everything looks distant through a camera.  On the other side, everything is vulnerable and exposed.  Thus creating real feelings and thoughts come out.  <br/><br/>Story-Interesting take on people's search for happiness.  The other really good one solely on the subject that I have seen is ""Happiness,"" which is much much darker, and more depressing.  This movie ends up to be a beautiful movie with a beautiful ending.  No, i am not sick for thinking that, but it was fitting and realistic. The neighbor also went through his own change and transformation, which means that the movie is all inclusive in shells, and the search for happiness.<br/><br/>All in all, i think that this is what Hollywood does best.  This is a great movie, that is only feel good once you intrepret it.  Hollywood should learn how to make movies that let you feel what you want.  People can be saddened by the movie if they want, i was cheered.  Plus, the movie was just so well done that everybody should see it.  However, do not expect anything or learn the plot.  I didn't know what it was, and loved it.-----10"

","As someone who enjoys personal stories told with truth, respect for reality and the movie goer, and humor, As someone who hoped there were still people willing and able to produce movies that reflect the way life is truly lived without stereotypical characters, As someone who loves the movies and the power they can and, all-too-occasionally do manifest for me, ""American Beauty"" is one of the finest movies I've seen. It's the quite believable tale of true life in America, particularly suburbia. It's a finely-written and courageously and stunningly acted story of loneliness, self-respect, the possibility for change and redemption, and the different paths we can take and what effect living our truth and lies can have."
"krouskop","10","0","0","4 November 1999"," There is something wrong if you don't enjoy this movie.
","This movie is simply beautiful. In fact, beauty is one of it's central themes. Yes - I just said that this movie has themes! And that's why it's good.<br/><br/>It has moral questions at it's base which provoke the viewer.<br/><br/>And what really gets me is these people who post about the terrible nudity and sex in this movie. They make it sound like some kind of porno. Really, there are only three brief scenes of nudity. And there are no scenes of actual intercourse. As well, the scenes of nudity present a theme of innocence - not something dirty. In fact, one nude scene is used to show the true interest Ricky has in Jane. As she removes her top, he adjusts his filming to - her face.<br/><br/>Other complaints about stereotypes are equally unfounded. Again, like the nudity - they are present, but their presence is used to develop the movie. The reason stereotypes exist is because, well... they exist. Everyone uses them. Right or wrong, they are a reality, and this movie tries - and in my opinion - succeeds in presenting a reality.<br/><br/>The movie is good because it presents themes based in a presented reality. Nudity and stereotypes both exist in our reality and are used to further the themes. Unless you are some type of extremist or reactionary who can not simply look at the presented value of the nudity and stereotypes of this movie, you will enjoy this movie. In fact, you'll enjoy this movie a lot.<br/><br/>And, if you don't enjoy this movie - you either are incapable of deep thought which this movie attempts to provoke or are such an extremist you are distracted from the actual content of the movie.  ....Or some punk thirteen year old kid who shouldn't have been allowed in the theater in the first place was making out with his girlfriend behind you the whole time, which would run any movie."
"tullymox","9","0","0","4 November 1999"," Believe the hype (*SPOILERS*)
","As I sort through the enormous volume of user comments, I am surprised by how many people disliked this film.  While not perfect, in my opinion, it was at least one of the best films of this decade.  Kevin Spacey gives the best performance in a continually improving career; this guy has been great since he played Mel Profitt on Wiseguy and just keeps getting better.  I think people should stop listening to the reviews, their friends, the user comments on this board, and any other sources of pre-rendered opinions of this movie.  Some people have tried to compare this with The Ice Storm, which tried to be everything that this movie was and failed miserably.  I feel that American Beauty succeeded where TIS did not in that both groups, the adults and teenagers, were well-written and acted.  In TIS, the adult performances were just not very good, although I think much of that had to do with the writing.  One of the more perplexing aspects of the criticism has to do with the ""gratuitous"" female nudity.  I am one of the most vocal critics of ""An Officer and A Gentleman"" mini-porno sex scenes that have nothing to add to character development and have everything to do with female exploitation.  However, the two scenes of nudity in this film were EXTREMELY important to the film.  The first, Thora Birch exposing herself to Wes Bentley, relates to her lack of self-esteem about her breasts and body. Initially, she is searching Breast Augmentation websites and views herself as unnattractive.  It is exactly that quality that Mena Suvari's character feeds off - someone with lower self-esteem than her who can make her feel good about herself.  Bentley's interest in her makes her realize that she is genuinely beautiful, and her willingness to share her body with him is a great step in her development as a character.  Suvari's scene is even more effective.  As Lester pulls her shirt open, revealing her beautiful breasts and increasing his already powerful sexual desire for her, she reveals that she is in fact, a virgin.  I have never seen a better representation of a penis-deflating moment in my life.  Within the same camera shot, a character changes from a purely sexual creature to a childish innocent.  I would gamble that most men watching this movie had the same reaction that Lester had.<br/><br/>Also, I can't understand why so many people disliked Bening's performance. The complexity of her character is amazing to me. She comes off as a cold, inhuman ice queen, but the displays of vulnerability are very well-done. Remember, Bening doesn't undergo the same epiphany that Spacey does in the movie. She has an affair, reawakens her sexuality, and takes more chances with her life.  But, the couch scene should make it perfectly clear that she is not completely transformed.  Her insecurities are totally obvious as she prepares to confront her husband just prior to his shooting; she still can't open up the way Lester wants her to, the way that she used to in the early years of their marriage.<br/><br/>Finally, the Chris Cooper character may be similar to many of the other macho, militaristic characters we've seen before, but both the actor and the writing give him so much more depth than the cliche-ridden caricature that many have criticized him as being.  This is a man who has destroyed the mental health of his wife and very nearly his son because he is latently a homosexual.  you can see how tortured he is by his own self-loathing from the very beginning; he is not a hateful antagonist, but another pathetic example of how the roles society expect us to play can torture us with their limitations.<br/><br/>American Beauty is an incredible example of how compartmentalized our society has become; very much the epitome of the folk song 'Little Boxes"". We isolate ourselves in our cookie cutter homes, going to ubiquitous fast food chains and mini-malls; sitting in our car for the two hours of our commute, we blind ourselves to the existence of beauty in the person sitting in the car next to us.  We sit in cubicles all day long, sacrificing social interaction for the painful isolation of a computer screen that slowly but surely sucks the life out of us.  We come home to a family that no longer has any desire to interact with each other - they're too wrapped up in their own trips.  Eventually, the years pass us by, leaving us to reflect on the people we once were so long ago.  Lester shows us that that person never truly dies but just goes on an extended vacation, waiting to be reawakened. In his death, Lester is resurrected; the final moment of realization reflected in Kevin Spacey's face as the gun slowly moves to the back of his head is one of the most beautiful ever put on film.<br/><br/>This film deserves every kudo it is being given and will ultimately surpass 99% of the other suburban nightmare films that have come before it."

","Big-ass spoilers follow.  I had heard incredibly good things about this movie before I saw it, and I was prepared for a big let-down.  Luckily I was not disappointed.  I rarely enjoy a movie as much as I enjoyed this one.  I kept telling my girlfriend throughout the film---  ""I just absolutely love this movie."" ""That was so cool!"" ""That guy is my idol.""  The characters connected with me in such a personal way I could not believe it.  The disgust that Lester shows for his pathetic suburban life, and Spacey's fantastic performance, excited me to no end.  The arty drug-dealing teenager was my favorite, though.  His calm and confidence were inspiring.  A friend of mine had a hard time believing that anyone would find things like dead birds beautiful.  Well, I went to art school for five years, I have artist friends, I make art myself, and I have known and even momentarily been this character many times during my life.  I've never known anyone with a supply of genetically engineered super-weed, though.  Anyway, when the shot of the teenagers watching the plastic bag on the screen came up, I nearly wept.  I loved these characters because for all the qualities I admired in them, there was something about each one that I totally despised.  They were like my friends and family--- I loved and hated them.  The dinner scenes were some of the best work I have ever seen in any film.  If only more hit movies had this kind of depth and this kind of humor.  American Beauty gives me hope for the future."

","It's high time that someone reminded those Americans with particularly tight sphincters that they (and those around them) could enjoy their lives more (and discover more meaning in their lives) if they dedicated themselves to enjoying their lives more. And that might mean remembering stuff they once enjoyed doing and trying those things again. Here in the Land of the Free, this seemingly benign prescription becomes radical stuff when it involves both risking one's pathetic career and firing up the evil weed. There's a lot more going on in this movie and I'm not going to try to cover much of the ground, largely because it's so lovely discovering treasures on your own.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey is building a legacy of greatness, both in his shrewd choices of roles and in their execution. Here he is allowed to do his finest work to date in a part that seems custom-made for his range of emotion and larger-than-life screen presence. Annette Benning is superb as The Wife, as are the remaining members of the cast. The directing by first-timer Sam Mendes is simply fresh and inspired, particularly in the sumptuously choreographed and filmed dream sequences involving rose petals and a perfectly slutty little cheerleader.<br/><br/>But the inner beauty of this film is in the way it manages to deftly and comically savage a rich suite of dysfunctions  eroding the mental health and general contentment of the contemporary American family while paying very close attention to positive, hopeful qualities in almost every character. I was amazed and impressed that it was The Wife of all people who brought tears to my eyes. That the audience is allowed to empathize with these folks, rather than simply pointing fingers at their all-too-human deficiencies, is the film's genius."

","THIS ONE IS A DEFINITE SPOILER, SO BE WARNED!!! If you ""look closer"" at this movie, you may find the horrible truth. It is easily the most over-rated film of the year. It disturbs me that so many people call this movie great. We start off fine and dandy. Tensions at the dinner table, a sexually frustrated married couple, a horribly pessimistic and self-loathing Lester... This is the best thing the movie has going. When Lester catches his first glimpse of Angela, his daughter's teenage cheerleader friend, we have one of the most beautifully done movie scenes in recent history. The momentum continues only for a short time after this. Lester eavesdrops on his daughter and her friend and overhears some tips on how to be more attractive to his young goddess. Kevin Spacey is briefly brilliant as the 42-year old obcessed with impressing this teenager by lifting weights. He takes a new outlook on life, and becomes rebellious. The tremendous discomfort at the dinner table scuffles is the last good piece of movie left in ""American Beauty."" As Lester says during his morningly masturbation ritual in the shower, ""It's all down hill from here."" We are less than half-way through the movie, and the focus turns to Lester's daughter, played by Thora Birch. She does not have the skill to carry any drama, let alone a struggling, lopsided one like this. A weird, poorly acted role of a drug-dealing, teenage peeping Tom character wrestles his way in and ruins everything. He and his father are such pitifully formulaic characters that it makes me sick. Are we supposed to believe that an 18-year old would actually go around recording plastic bags floating in the wind or a dead man on the side of the road because he's obcessed with beauty? So much so that it makes him feel pain? The end was a pitiful attempt at surprise. . . In my opinion, it would be much better. . The production design of this movie is great. It actually is beautiful. It is wildly funny and clever at the beginning, but strains and spins out to a dismal end. It's a half-baked script. I like the performances of Kevin Spacey, and this is one of his better ones, but I still think he has a long way to go. Because of poor writing, he turns from being the perfect Lester into an actor miscast in a strange role. Annette Benning gives the best performance out of the bunch, and deserves Oscar consideration. All of the young actors were terrible, but I can't blame them. Leaving this move will give you a weird feeling. It is definitely entertaining at times, but is for the most part half-baked. The most tell-tale sign of a poor script is the obvious plug for the legalization of marijuana. Frankly, I think the first half of this script was written sober, and finished while high. I'm glad to see a movie like this get such popularity (as opposed to a movie like ""Armageddon""), but this just isn't the right movie. If you want a good one, go see ""Bringing Out the Dead."" I'd give it a 7 out of 10, but for reasons that most people can't appreciate. I share the view of themes it expresses, such as 1) A fully-grown man can be happy with a fast food job, even when his wife is making a lot more money than him, and 2) Material possessions mean nothing (as it is presented through the couch scene). I give Sam Mendes credit for the effort, but the fact is, if you look closer, you'll not see the underbelly of suburbia. You'll see the underbelly of a borderline flop."

The movie is about the dehumanizing effects of 1) repressing feelings and 2) pretending that everything's ""spectacular.""  The only 'real' characters were the daughter (Thora Birch) and the guy next door with his camera.  And they're constantly branded in this film as being ""weird"" or a ""psycho.""  The movie really impacted me to the point of actually developing a different outlook on life.  It's that good.  The ending is perfect.

I wanted to watch a movie about real life with my mom so we could have something more interesting to talk about and I thought this would do it. It did. This movie tells the very truth that, I think, most people block out of there minds. Life is full of problems and we all have them. Even if they are differant than other people's problems, they still affect us all in the same way. I would give the movie an A just for that message. Also, most people on this Earth are too preoccupied with their life because they think they have it so bad, that they never stop to look at what they've got. If they were to look and see the many beautiful things in life just once, they'd see that their life is great for that reason alone. Well about the movie, it's great. I think it's the best movie this year so far. The performances are undescribable. Everyone does outstanding jobs, but the best by far is, of course, Kevin Spacey as the ever so true Lester Burnham. He does so good at bring the character to life that it's the best performance I've seen in my whole life and the best in movie history. He is your average person who starts to get fed up with his whole life and lives like he should've lived his entire life: doing anything he feels like doing. Even if that means masturbating right in front of his wife. His life being changed sets off the whole mess that messes his family up more than it already was, which was to say, a lot. He smokes weed, works out, listens to his music he used to when he was a wild teen, even falls in love with his sisters friend. More and more he changes, so does his family.

","American Beauty- A journey into the dysfunctional land of Middle America. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is in the throes of a mid-life crisis: he hates his job, has an antagonistic relationship with his shrewish, manic depressive wife (Annette Bening), his daughter hates him and he has a crush on his daughter's best friend.  And courtesy of the boy next door (whose family is even more messed up!) we get a step-by-step videography of Lester's therapy in action.<br/><br/>The trailers for Beauty intrigued me, and I was thrilled to stumble on an advance screening.  I was not disappointed: Spacey delivers another in a long line of fantastic performances (the Usual Suspects, Seven, Swimming With the Sharks).  I tried to think of another actor who could have done this role, and drew a blank - Spacey just blends into his parts so well. This is his best work yet (not a statement to be made lightly).<br/><br/>Bening gives her best performance since The Grifters - I have been so disappointed with her recent movies, as they simply failed to showcase her acting abilities.

","This is the darkest of dark comedies, and part of the humor is how the viewer is pulled in and dragged down with the characters. At first, the film seems quirky but funny, with Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning playing a disfunctional but almost cartoon-like suburban couple with a rebellious child. Nothing new there, right? Well, soon it becomes obvious that there is a lot more to it than that, and we are pulled along by a fantastic script as the conflicts emerge. I have never before witnessed such a beautifully accurate portrayal of modern dilemmas. Like much of the 1990's, this film is in-your-face and has no compassion for the light-hearted. Homosexuality, young lust, identity crises, bigots and power-mongers seeth through the film, tearing apart two families and leaving no pure hero, and no obvious villain. We are allowed to see both sides of all characters, and so instead of caricatures, we see real human beings, and so the tragedy of it all hits even harder."

This is the same sort of beauty that struck me in Spacey's character. He is a synthetic dope, the lifeless end product of a lifeless culture, who rails against the bars of his cage with a final burst of passionate awareness. He is not a hero in the classic sense. He instantiates no social change, he quells no tangible beast. But, he is courageous. He wakes himself from a twenty year somnambulance to taste the bitter fruits if his reality and, more importantly, to do something about it. Like the plastic bag, he is allotted one final pirouetting tumble before the storm."

The Alan Ball script is so strong that even the image of a bag blowing in the wind is completely captivating - not once, but twice.<br/><br/>American Beauty celebrates life amidst adversity with a boldness similar to that found in Life is Beautiful.  Visually, it is in the same innovative league as the recent Run Lola Run.  American Beauty has the emotional content and power that was missing from Eyes Wide Shut.<br/><br/>After already establishing himself as an extraordinary actor in Swimming with Sharks, the Usual Suspects, and Seven; after redefining a classic role in Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh on Broadway earlier this year; Kevin Spacey's performance in American Beauty somehow manages to raise the bar of excellence even higher.   He may not have received a Tony Award in 1999, but as far as I'm concerned, the upcoming Oscar for Best Actor might as well be given to Kevin Spacey right now.  Annette Bening also gives the performance of her career. Best Line:  `Never underestimate the power of denial.'"

","This was amazing!  Everything about it was perfect!  The story, the directing, the timing, and especially the cast.  Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning were both superb in their roles and seemed more like real people than characters.  In fact, all of the roles were done perfectly -- not overdone.  It's a refreshing change from most movies and tv shows these days that really play up the stereotypes to get a few laughs or tears.  I just really think this was such an incredible film, one that would take you through just about every emotion if you let it, and would teach you something about yourself if you paid attention.  It's is by far the best film of the year, and if you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out.  Go see it in the theaters where you can get completely engulfed by it.  Go see it... yeah, right now!

","So far, American Beauty has had more good reviews than bad ones on this message board. But there is one constant negative reproach made to it, and it is the lack or originality of the story. And I agree that the Frustrated Man Going Through his Mid-life Crisis is not the freshest subject. But... to be realistic, one has to say that there isn't many truly original stories anymore, except maybe in sci-fi. And there is not two human stories alike.<br/><br/>As to the fact that Spacey and Suvari have a rather...risky scene together, I think that they are perfectly tasteful and relevant to the story.<br/><br/>Of course, this may not be the best movie of all times, maybe not even of the year, but it is a truly sensitive treatment of human despair and hope.

","Annette Benning plays a success driven, neurotic wife to Kevin Spacey's suburbanite dissatisfied with his job, home and sex-life.

It is neither trite nor hackneyed.  American Beauty is, in one word, beautiful.  Sam Mendes' camera angles create a mystical atmosphere that allows the audience to see the pure beauty of life. Now you think it's hokey and sentimental.  Once again, you're wrong.  I hate sentimentality, but I adored this movie.

","I just think that too many people are making too big a deal about this film. Sure, Spacey is great, as usual, but was there really anything that original about the characters?  A father on a mid-life crisis (something so common there is a NAME for it), a mother who defines herself through work, both trying too hard to be a part of their daughter's life, their daughter trapped in suburbia, a pretty girl who's insecure, a hard-line patroit who turns out to be sort of gay, his submissive wife, and of course the two gay guys.  Did I leave anybody out?  (other than minor characters, all stereotypical themselves)  These type of people are ones I have seen every day of my life, and feel that many others have, too.<br/><br/>But still, it does hit you on an emotional level, and I like that.  That nightmare of modern life, the empty lies we tell to everyone else, and even ourselves, need to be expressed in art, and often.  With some characters that I haven't seen before, it might have been a classic. 7/10"

It's so easy to get stuck in a rut, and this movie is, at least, a reminder that no rut is too deep to escape.  Was I holding my breath at the end, waiting for the outcome, uncertain of the outcome?

His wife, played by Annette Benning, is a failing real estate broker whose business is as shakey as her marriage and her sense of security. The daughter, completely ignored by her parents, falls in love with a boy who has just moved in next door that deals drugs for money he uses to buy film equiptment so he can film ""beautiful things"" such as a dying animal. His father, an ex-Marine Colonel asks for a urine sample every six months. Nice happy family, isn't it?<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey does an amazing job narrating and playing the lead.

","Well, it looks like nearly everyone truly loves this movie, and so do I.<br/><br/>A lot of movies that are artistic and admirable still don't really grip you all they way through, but this one did for me. When I saw it a second time, I still felt completely involved at every moment. There was always an image on screen worth looking at, even studying, for all the details of the composition: the composed squares of windows at night and camera viewfinder and so on. There was attention to this. Every performance was just perfect.<br/><br/>Annette Benning was hilarious and really perfect. So funny and moving even as she played the type of character who isn't usually sympathized with. You know it really does ruin the mood if the guy attempting to have sex with you is holding a beer bottle slantwise near the upholstery that you've struggled to buy and maintain. That's why Spacey sounds trite, as one commenter commented, when he rants to her about caring about things. Hey, remember that scene begins with him playing with his new toy and pleased at having bought a new car. You aren't supposed to actually buy his throwback to the sixties mentality: he's just discovered his inner teenager there. Enough has been said about Spacey.<br/><br/>I just want to identify the two actors I'd nominate for their supporting roles. First, Chris Cooper. The long wet closeup is a great sustained performance that feels completely real and unbearably painful. Just to think of it now gives me chills.<br/><br/>Second, Mena Suvari. She is absolutely perfect in this role, funny, moving. I didn't notice how great she was the first time I saw the movie, because she was such a type until toward the end, but the second time I noticed all the perfect detail in this performance. I also saw her in a TV interview: she looked nothing like the character in the movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, I would have said I'd like to see these four actors sweep the acting Oscars except that I'm still trying to deal with the immense awe inspired by Ving Rhames in Bringing Out the Dead."

The story unfolds at a decent pace, but so many different things happen that by the end of the movie, it's a little overwhelming when you try to analyze the film.  It's one of those films that leaves you in awe of everything.  You feel strange when you get out of your seat.  It's really hard to describe whether the film is a comedy, drama, or maybe even horror on an intellectual level.

","This film struck was a mixed bag. On the one hand, some of the characters (Lester in particular) were well written and well acted. Kevin Spacey is a delight to watch as he fully inhabits his character and makes us care about and understand him. On the other hand, several characters are overdone to a cartoonish degree: Annette Benning and Chris Cooper's characters in particular. I found the unrealistically dysfunctional military family particularly offensive. (Why, whenever there is only one set of characters in a film who are associated with the military, they are invariably psychotic? If other types of people were so regularly misrepresented there would be an outcry.)<br/><br/>So, I'd say that ""American Beauty"" was interesting, fairly well done, but still somewhat flawed.

","When Sam Mendes' camera is focused on Kevin Spacey's Lester Burnham, who has to be one of the most interesting characters in recent cinematic memory, ""American Beauty"" is a pretty terrific, engrossing film. Unfortunately, there's more to ""American Beauty"" than just Lester. The man seems to disappear for (very long) stretches of time, leaving us to the devices of Annette Bening's shrill, one-dimensional character, or, even worse, Thora Birch's unbelievably obnoxious Jane. The subplot concerning her and the creepy next-door kid is totally out of place and takes up waaaaaaay too much screen time. Somewhere hidden under the ""Dawson's Creek"" outtakes and lame New Age philosophy, there is an interesting character study going on, but we'll have to settle for just glimpses of it."

It's ultimate message (delivered in the most unbearably heavy handed monologue I've heard in a while) is that if you appreciate the beautiful things in the world then you will make yourself happy.<br/><br/>The ""good guys"" in this movie are the people who became true to themselves like the Lester, daughter Jane, and boyfriend Rickie. The people who tried to be things they weren't, like the closet homosexual colonel, and dirty girl Angela, suffered. The characters were not ""multidimensional"" or realistic, as other comments have indicated, just caricaturized highly emotional stereotypes.<br/><br/>The numerous plot twists seemed to be completely unnecessary. There was no reason for Kevin Spacey to die other than to create shock value in the beginning and to get the audience to play ""guess the killer"" as the movie became less interesting later on. Similarly the Lolita subplot proved pointless and didn't go anywhere.<br/><br/>I am being hard on this movie because of all the acclaim it seems to be getting.

","It seems that Kevin Spacey makes any movie that he is in great (or just about any movie he's in).  Once again, he gets to display his tremendous acting talent.  In fact, ALL of the performances in this movie were fantastic.  I particularly loved Annette Bening's performance.  It's always a delight to see her act in movies, but she totally outdid anything she's done in movies before.  Her performance is this movie was marvelous.  I think that the best thing about this movie was that it had some of the best performances I have seen in movies.  Beyond that, this movie can be described in many ways.  Among other things, it was hilarious, witty, touching, and moving.  I really enjoyed seeing this movie, and I'm thinking of going to see it again.  I highly recommend it, and I think that EVERYONE should see this movie.  However, I think this movie is overrated.  It definitely is ranked too highly on IMDB's top 250 (the #1 movie???).  It definitely is not the best movie of all time, nor is it one of the top ten movies of all time.  Mind you, there are movies in the 101-250 range that SHOULD rank higher than this movie.  Yet, could this be THE best movie of this year?  It's too early to tell--the movie studios usually roll out the ""big guns"" at the end of a year.  But ""American Beauty"" surely is ONE of the best movies of 1999.  It's a shame that 1999 has been such a bad year for movies.  In my opinion, this has been the worst year for movies in recent times.  I'm still waiting to see ""Boys Don't Cry"" and ""The Emperor and the Assassin"".

This story is relative to anyone who has attempted to define themselves at one point or another by material posessions and status.<br/><br/>Personally I was moved to learn that I am not the only person who has been through something like this.  After you wake up you think you are seeing things knowbody else can, Spacey  brings the reality of this growth to the screen.<br/><br/>Big thumbs up to Wes Bentley for a performance that will most definitely bring him to the big screen many times in the years to come.

"Movie-12","10","0","0","21 October 1999"," The best picture of the year!!! **** out of ****
","AMERICAN BEAUTY (1999) ****><br/><br/> How do you review a movie with as much emotionally harrowing power as ""Amer ican Beauty,"" being able to only use words, and still give the film the justice it deserves? It is next to impossible to do. ""American Beauty"" is not a comedy, even though it's surprisingly hilarious at times, and contains some very witty and outrageous dialogue. The film is not a drama, nor is ita thriller or an action picture. If the truth be known, ""American Beauty"" doesn't fit agreeably into any given category. What this film is; easily the best picture of the year to date. That said, the film isn't for everyone. It isn't a date movie, a feel-good movie, nor is it appropriate to take the family to on a Sunday afternoon. Sam Mendes has constructed a flawless and mesmerizing production that is mature and adult, intended for people who are emotionally effected by movies---and it sure is a beauty.<br/><br/> The film centers on one main character, who is going through a mid-life crisis. His name is Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), and at first glance, it may appear that him, his wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), and his daughter, Jane (Thora Birch from ""Alaska""), have a perfectly happy family life.<br/><br/> While things look as if they are going well for the Burnhams, in reality, it's everything but. Lester's fourteen year career is going nowhere. His boss is just about to start layoffs after they decide who is needed and who isn't. And Lester's presence sure isn't required for the company to function properly. His wife is hiding her inner emotions behind a fake smile that she puts on for all her friends. She is having an affair with the opposing real estate agent, Buddy, after learning how much the two of them have in common.<br/><br/>His daughter hates him and they barely communicate with each other, not to mention the fact that she is saving up money for breast implants, not that Lester cares about her. His new neighbors are a strict family in which the father, Colonel Fitts, beats his son and hates the fact that he lives right next door to two homosexual lovers. His son, Ricky, is actually a successful drug dealer, whose business later becomes involved with Lester. He is also obsessed with uncovering and videotaping  the beauty in things.<br/><br/> ""American Beauty"" is the story of Lester's reincarnation. Once he lays eyes on the love of his dreams, one of Jane's best friends at a cheer leading seminar, he instantly wakes up to the world around him. He feels that there is a meaning to his life, and won't let anyone, not his boss, or his wife, or his daughter, take that away from him.<br/><br/>Director Sam Mendes pays close attention to each individual character, giving them an inner personality, depth, and most of all, complexity. Lester is the center of the story here, that is obvious. But what precise, detailed emotional characteristics explored with the character here. The result is hypnotic empathy for most of the movie's main characters---who are perfectly cast and wonderfully portrayed.<br/><br/>Of course, a character is only as good as the performer playing him or her. In the case of ""American Beauty,"" the starring roles are acted by first class performers. I have always been a huge fan of Kevin Spacey, who is most famous for his superb performances in ""Seven,"" ""The Usual Suspects,"" and ""The Negotiator."" In this film, he defines his character with the right amount of emotional depression and inner complexity needed. Once again, the Oscar goes to Spacey. Annette Bening also has her career high with her performance. She provides the hidden suffering and unhappiness that Carolyn Burnham requires. She fills her with determination and personal respect, all that exists falsely down deep. The actors involved with the Burnham family form the decisive formation of a realistic dysfunctional family.<br/><br/> The movie not only triumphs with its characters, design and presentation, but also with the unique and elaborate structure it beholds. The film is held together with conflicts in the narrative through line--a series of events that connect to one other. The internal and external problems are faced within the narrator, Lester. The tensions arise, become more and more complicated, then the issues are solved. But this is not your ordinary climax, here. It is not necessarily unexpected, but when it concludes itself, one would be lucky to walk out of the theater without an emotional reaction---regardless of how heavy it may be. The movie ends how it needs to end. It leaves us with not a message, nor a moral, but a character who has lost everything yet feels the best about himself as he has in the longest time.<br/><br/> ""American Beauty"" is a rare film. More than just a big production hoping to gross millions of dollars. It is a lot more than that. It is an explanation of  why I love the movies so much."

","American Beauty, the American directoral debut by Sam Mendes, is a life preserver for those who feel they are drowning in a sea of sickeningly sweet, and or sophomoric teen movies.<br/><br/>No time to test the water, American Beauty plunges right in- Jane Burnham played by Thora Birch, in effect opens pandora's box as she discusses in a home video clip why she thinks her ""loser"" father needs to be ""put out of his misery.""  This, as well as our knowledge that her father Lester Burnham, Kevin Spacey, will be dead within one year, comprise the skeleton to which the meat of the plot is bound.<br/><br/>This dark-comedy packs much more emotional punch (to make an understatement) than all of the She's-All-That-s or Never Been Kissed could ever hope todo.  One aspect of the film that seems to set it a notch above the rest of the rabble attempting to accurately depict teen life, is that this one is not only about teens.  Mendes manages to pull off  a cinematic concept rarely attempted.  He incorporates teens and adults equally into the movie, without entirely favoring one group or the other,  and allows you to sympathize with the parents as well as the children in the film.<br/><br/>Lester, played by Kevin Spacey,  is introduced as a depressed middle aged man stuck in a suburban hell.  One day his nagging, real estate-selling wife, played by Annette Bening, coerces him into attending a high-school basketball game to show his support for Jane who is a cheerleader.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, his half-hearted attempt to connect with his daughter ends up driving them farther apart when he spots Jane's best friend Angela Hayes, Mena Suvari, the stereotypical cheerleader (i.e. tall, thin and blond) and promptly becomes infatuated with her.<br/><br/>Lester's obsession becomes the catalyst for a life-wide makeover.  Although throwing off the shackles of suburbia and basically regressing to adolescence is good for Lester, Carolyn doesn't take it so well, and is driven into the arms (and bed) of her rival.<br/><br/>Mendes could have made the film an all out tear-jerker.  Rather, he opts to leave all of his characters flawed, permitting the audience to take a more objective and detached view of their less than ordinary lives.  By leaving each with a shred of dignity (only a shred mind you) Mendes has the capacity to fashion American Beauty into an emotional roller coaster- soaring up to the hilarious and laugh-out-loud, and plummeting to the heart wrenching, and frequently spiraling through the two simultaneously, all the while being conducted through the complex plot safely by Spacey's tremendous performance.<br/><br/>And the new neighbors arrive just in time for the party.  Ricky Fitts, Wes Bentley, the strange son whom Jane first meets when she catches him filming her, seems practically normal in comparison to his violent, homophobic, ex-military father, Chris Cooper, and his essentially catatonic mother, Allison Janney.  The Fitts provide the icing on the cake of the plot.<br/><br/> Despite the stellar cast,  American Beauty, is not flawless. Carolyn's contrived caricature of the overworked, underappreciated career mother appeared particularly muted in comparison to her family, to all of whom could be applied the film's tagline, ""look closer.""<br/><br/>Teen flicks are fun, but they are all the more entertaining when viewed as part of a balanced diet, and in moderation.  American Beauty is the perfect supplement, or perhaps even nicotine patch, to help high schoolers get off their sickeningly sweet teen flick sugar high.  If you cannot decide whether you want to laugh or cry, American Beauty is the perfect movie for you."

And the visuals are both beautiful, and simplistic at the same time.<br/><br/>Many people would say the Tom Hanks is the actor of the decade, but I think that this movie clinches that title for Spacey. This role has more depth than Verbal Kint, and unbelievably, more suprise. Everyone else is amazing as well, but Spacey is the glue.<br/><br/>I can't say enough good things about this movie. You have to see it for yourself to believe it. So stop sitting there and go to the theater. You won't be dissappointed."

","Red Roses.  The Red American Beauty Rose, an apt symbol for this film of deep emotions. Some films have an interesting beginning or ending with not much in the middle -- this film has it all! Narration in a film rarely works for me because I have found it is usually a cover up for a poor script or story.  Here, narration does work for me (as it does in the classic, ""Sunset Boulevard"", worthy of comparison).  Through the initial narration and a ""preview"" of a scene that is shown more fully later, we learn early that our main character will be dead in less than a year (or in 122 minutes, depending on whether you are in real time or movie time).  It is appropriate that we know this because the comedy is so masterful, we might be tricked into thinking it is a comedy with perhaps some pathos.  It is a movie which cuts across genres.<br/><br/>The foundation for the film is an intelligent, courageous script (thanks, Alan Bail) which was turned over to masterful direction (Sam Mendes ) and acting.  I noticed and appreciated the crafting of little details, such as making Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) look small and lost in an office as he faces the potential of losing his job; red American Beauty Roses and rose petals carefully placed throughout; and varied settings/backgrounds that were perfectly suited to the individual personalities.  It explores ordinary people somewhat reminiscent of ""Ordinary People"" and shows us intertwined neighborhood families somewhat similar to ""Ice Storm."" <br/><br/>The story takes place in an unnamed suburban town, which seems appropriate as this film does not need another character.  We are taken into the intimate lives of nearly a dozen characters, each with different relationships.  Each phrase, each action, each scene tells us about these characters and their relationships, while conveying several interwoven stories.   I can only speculate at the many scenes that must have been written and eliminated in order to create the script that told so much.   I found the sexual fantasy scenes to be very original, and the pacing to be steady.    <br/><br/>Kevin Spacey is nothing short of brilliant, with his expressions of a full range of emotions, giving us Lester Burnham, an original character.  He changes in many ways through this film; I especially appreciate the change that is shown in is face and actions and but a few words in the last scene with Angela (Mena Suvari), his teenage daughter's girlfriend.  Carolyn Burnham is also a distinct character  (Annette Bening, who did not look or sound anything like Sydney Ellen Wade in one of my all-time favorite films, ""The American President"").   Ricky's father is played eloquently by Chris Cooper, one of my favorite character actors.  These three actors I have seen in many different roles: I say this is acting at its best -- unlike so many popular stars who play the same character again and again.   <br/><br/>I also want to applaud the work of the three teenagers.  The young women (Thora Birch  and Mena Suvari) were believable and poignant.  The 18-year old neighbor Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) is wise beyond his years.  The insights written into his dialogue seemed perfectly placed, as he is the one who sees the world through the eyes of a photographer. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this as one of the finest films of the year and beyond.  It is deep, likely to make a lasting impression."

Kevin Spacey was frighteningly good in this movie and I foresee a mighty prominent future for him in films. I appreciate him as an actor and he brings an amazing complexity to this film. As others have discussed, the ending is disappointing, because the resolution feels conflicted and somewhat convoluted, but the realism of this film made me realize the misery of our world today, and how many of us are truly wandering blind and emotionless, and how this film was the honest step into the brain of our world today.

So last weekend, she came home, and we saw it.<br/><br/>At first, I was really looking at it like, ""Okay, where is this gonna go next?""  I didn't think it was that good to begin with.

Once I got through half of the movie, I started to relax a little and realize how good of a film it really is.<br/><br/>Yes, you can consider it an American satire.  The characters are shallow enough until the last twenty minutes or so, but then it reaches a major enlightenment and the last twenty minutes of the movie make it an eager watching for anyone.

","American Beauty is a funny and disturbing film.  There are echoes of the voyeurism in ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape"", the sickening inbred suburbia of ""Edward Scissorhands"", and the dark humor of ""Twin Peaks"".  In other words, this is really good stuff.<br/><br/>The film is constructed from the archetypal cliches of suburbia.  Lolita cheerleaders, depressed goth teens, harried real estate agents, overbearing ex-marines, and our hero, a free spirit who lost his soul in the 9-to-5. Everybody (and I mean everybody) in this movie is leading their own quiet life of desparation, while outwardly displaying a suitable guise of stability and satisfaction.  This theme allows the movie to quickly paint the personalities of a quirky and eerie bunch of folks.<br/><br/>We seem to have fewer and fewer options as we mature.  The film asserts that plenty of options remain, but that we are simply (perhaps justifiably) too afraid to persue them.  When we recognize this truth, and question our own definition of success, we are ripe for a mid-life crisis.  Everybody in this film succeeds by rejecting their assigned roles, which leads to exquisite failure in their established lives.<br/><br/>What happens when a sleeping soul wakes up and discovers he is truly free? What if everybody around him is just barely hanging on under the status quo? What if that awakened soul is the wonderfully understated Kevin Spacey? It's a huge subterranean train wreck just waiting to happen, yet the viewpoint of the protagonist and narrator is removed and sardonic.  We are left feeling helpless, giddy, fearful, and perhaps motivated to break a few conventions before we petrify."

","Sam Mendes, the 34 year old director of this movie, is noted for his stage work but had never directed a film until American Beauty.  He has gotten some terrific acting out of his talented cast.  If there are not a few Oscars handed out next year, then the Academy should pack up and go home (I suppose there are some who already believe they should).  Like Blue Velvet and a few other similarly themed movies, American Beauty exposes the facade behind the American dream. I have a feeling that many who will see this film will doubt that such ""goings on"" could occur in such ""nice"" suburban homes. Well, I have just seen a special on Frontline on PBS about a large group of teenagers in an affluent suburb of Atlanta.  Their foray into group sex and drugs makes the events of American Beauty look like Mary Poppins by comparison!  Don't let those beautiful houses with their neat lawns and outwardly smiling occupants fool you.  To quote the famous line from Cold Comfort Farm; ""there's something nasty in the woodshed!""<br/><br/>The familiar actors in the movie, which include Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Peter Gallagher and Chris Cooper, are augmented by some very talented unknowns.  I was especially impressed with Thora Birch, who plays the teenaged daughter of the Spacey and Bening characters.  But then, Mr. Mendes has gotten excellent performances out of everyone.  If I have any reservation at all about any of the actors, it would be that he has gotten too much performance out of Ms. Bening.  I found her histrionics to be a bit over-the-top.  I am a Bening fan and have loved her in her other films, but I thought she went ""above and beyond"" here.<br/><br/>I have seen this film twice.  The first time was with relatives during a recent trip to Connecticut.  The second time was with a good friend who thought it was one of the best he'd seen in a long while.  I thought long and hard about American Beauty before submitting this review and concluded that I was incorrect about a few initial reservations that I had, which I changed my mind about as a result of the second viewing.

For all the film's indications to ""look closer"", there seems to be very little beneath the surface.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey is quite good as Lester, going through a mid life crisis after he quits his job one fine day.  Yep, he's pretty cool when he blackmails the company (""pass the asparagus""), and he's pretty funny when he says the highlight of his day is masturbating in the shower, but though he's always compelling to watch, there's something about his performance - something a bit mannered which makes it not quite ""real"".  It's fine, intelligent work from a gifted craftsman, but I never felt an emotional resonance underneath - I never particularly cared about his plight.<br/><br/>As for Annette Benning, she's mannered to excess.  Her role (and performance) are akin to nails running down a chalkboard.  Those glaring eyes, that mouth set in a curt, silent shriek at all times.  I will confess, however, that her funniest moment is also her most pathetic, when she fails to make a real estate sale and starts slapping herself in the face over and over again.<br/><br/>The kids are effective, and the neo-nazi ex-marine next door (Chris Cooper, from Lone Star) is not as awful as you might expect - they manage to downplay the nazi stuff, and this character gives the film it's one interesting twist.<br/><br/>* * for American Beauty"

","When 'welcome to the dollhouse' (which I didn't particularly even like) and other similar movies in which the characters began to consider their personal condition more began to gain popularity, I was really into that. I was sick of the blockbuster phenomena and was glad that films like 'clerks' were becoming accessible.  However, through time, more and more and more and more of these movies came out and next thing I knew, America was ga-ga for self-indulgent film-making.  Which I don't think is wrong, but I think the manner in which it is done on 'american beauty' is a bit (a) melodramatic and (b) copied.  'American Beauty' is an amalgamation of, follow me here closely, happiness, office space and ordinary people.  In previous reviews, people mentioned annette bening's character being similar to mary tyler moore's character in 'ordinary people'--but I find that the family next door was closer to that of timothy hutton on 'o.p.'  The neighbour's father in this one (I'm awful with names) is more like mary tyler moore's character though he may have a bit of the father from 'shine' in him as well.  I did not dislike this movie necessarily, but I felt ...and still feel...that this movie is the defining film where people will say years from now, ""Boy, that american beauty sure did destroy the arty nihilistic films of the 90s.""  It took what was more significant in indepedent film and blew it wide open for the backstreet boys generation.  The relationships were poorly developed, the dialogue was stilted, and the misunderstood artist characters are overdone.

","What I love about this movie is that there are several different layers upon which one can enjoy this film as a work of art. First, the cinematography is fantastic. The scenes with the rose petals are very sensual and beautiful yet with a ""whimsical"" quality. Secondly, as human beings, there are more complex emotions and experiences than can be described in the words of any language. The quotes I found most memorable were when Ricky Fitts describes to Jane what he feels when he films--how there is so much beauty triggering so many emotions at once that he feels as though he will ""cave"" in. And again, at the end of the movie when the lead character describes what he experiences, the film again makes what I consider a brave and successful attempt to describe feelings that are haunting yet beautiful and all-consuming; feelings which are extremely hard to put into words. These two speeches carry the theme(as does the rest of the movie) that although so many moments in life may not stick out in our minds there is always beauty and meaning to find there. Also, (as a fair feminist) I like how this film speaks up for the overworked, underappreciated, middle-aged, American father. I enjoyed watching him standup for himself throughout the film. Watching this prepared me for events later in the film. I thoroughly loved how they touched on what really matters in life. They did a fantastic job presenting Lester's miserable, ""plastic"", materialistic wife and her ""struggle"" with understanding what truly matters in life."

","Hilarious at times, painfully sorrowful at others, ""American Beauty"" is, undoubtedly, one of the best movies in this decade.  While it doesn't make you cry (I assumed the it didn't, 'cause 'making you cry' is *so* not the purpose of this movie), as, i.e., ""Schindler's List,"" does, it wallops an emotional impact just as strong.  I read one review, somewhere, that the reviewer doesn't like the movie because he can't 'root' for anyone in it. Well, surprise of all surprises, you *aren't* supposed to root for our sad bunch of characters.  In fact, I can't even feel any sympathy for them, but I can empathize, as if their lives were my own.  Lester Burnham, our narrator and protagonist, at the beginning of the movie, said that his daughter thinks of him as a chronic loser.  And she's completely right; he *is*.  So's Carolyn, his wife; so's the daughter, Jane; and so's the daughter's best friend, Angela.  In fact, most of them are extremely selfish, and all of them, regardless, are a pathetic bunch of people. That's the exact point, for 'Life,' unfortunately, is never fair.  We're f**ked from the very beginning and we know it.  Intellectually we might have known for years, everytime that Life dealt you a harsh blow, but this movie made absolutely sure that you'll feel it thoroughly.  That's why, I think I can safely say, most of us have that feeling of being hit extremely hard on the head, that feeling of being completely stunned and blew over.  As much of a cliche as it is, I'm still going to say it, this movie forces us to think, to 'look closer' at our own lives.  And, quite frankly, we all need to do so.  As Socrates has said, a life unexamined is not worth living."

","I will admit that I wasn't particularly keen to see this movie when it came out.  It didn't really seem to have a major reading on my ""I must go see this movie"" meter.  But, I'm glad a couple friends did want to see it and dragged me out along for the ride.  Having seen it I can say that I would have been sorry to have missed such fine performances.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey is the central character in this black comedy/drama as the henpecked, overworked, and verging on middle-aged Lester Burnham .  The narrative at the beginning tells you that he was murdered, but who did it is almost incidental in comparison to everything that happens to him before that point. Somewhere in his past, he gave up his dreams and his ability to fight for them in exchange for status quo and a comfortable home.  His success-driven, bitch-on-wheels wife, Carolyn Burnham is played by Annette Bening.  Her portrayal of a Stepford Wife-like real estate agent who seems to do everything just right is soon revealed as a woman on the verge of some kind of breakdown every 5 minutes.<br/><br/>The dysfunctional couple does have a daughter, Jane (played by Thora Burch) who is smack dab in the middle of her ""The entire world is evilÂ…..and so I will be too"" brooding adolescent phase.  You can't help but be sympathetic, however, when her parents are more interested in quarreling with each other than they are in just talking to their only child.  This role is a Grand Canyon-sized departure for Thora Burch, who has, until this point, been the pint-sized and pig-tailed, cute-as-a-button kid in various roles since she was 6 years old.  If you look past the grunge-look dye job in this movie, you might recognize her as playing the daughter to Harrison Ford's Jack Ryan character in two different Tom Clancy movies from years past.<br/><br/>Things get really interesting in this story when new neighbors move in next door.  Teenaged video voyeur, Ricky Fitts (played by Wes Bentley) becomes drawn to his introverted and intriguing neighbor-girl, Jane.  Although seeming a bit on the strange side, he does have an eye for interesting visuals that is a bit intriguing.  What's more intriguing though, is his ""double life"" between playing the dutiful son to his Marine Colonel father and almost catatonic mother and yet secretly dealing high-end pot out of his dresser drawer to any and all with the means to purchase it.<br/><br/>The final pieces are put into place when Spacey's character falls head over heels for a beautiful Barbie doll on his daughter's cheerleading squad, and frightens everyone around him as he starts changing his attitude and his life.  It's terribly uplifting and somehow freeing to watch him liberate himself from a job he hates, a life he's bored with, and a middle-aged body he's neglected.  There are some seriously funny moments where you look at the screen and think ""boy, I wish I had the guts to do that"".<br/><br/>While some might consider some of the points to be a bit romanticized, I don't think that there's one of us who doesn't know these people or, even more frightening,  isn't one of them ourselves.  This movie is graced with some wonderful filming visuals that actually make a 40-something year old man's crush on a teenager a romantic rather than lustful concept.  He's not in love with her body, per se, but the whole idea of actually being the man that a girl like that could be in love with.  Spacey's performance in this is truly superb, and is alone worth an exorbitant movie ticket price.  I smell multiple Oscars in this movie's future."
"njh108","10","0","0","19 September 1999"," Post-Modern America at its finest in dysfunctionality
","From trailers alone, ""American Beauty"" showed the most interest in my mind this year. It is a deep, dark, and sometimes depressing movie about that which makes up our post-modern America. We have Lester Burnham, who Kevin Spacey brilliantly brings to life, starring as a 42-year old man in the midst of a mid-life crisis. He does not pull any punches on the decline of his life. He is stuck in a dead-end job for a company looking to lay people off. He has a wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), who is a typical working mom: She truly believes she is Supermom, despite that she treats young Jane (Thora Birch) like dirt. At first, you may think that this family's values are the core of the film, but this is an idea shortly put away.<br/><br/>
On one side of the Burnham house is a homosexual couple who do not flaunt their sexuality but are not ashamed of it. On the other side is an empty house, finally sold at the beginning of the film by Carolyn's long-time real estate rival, Buddy King. Buddy is the very successful business person that Carolyn only wishes she could be. <br/><br/>The new family that moves in is the Fitts. They are a retired member of the US Marine Corp, his stay-at-home wife, and their son, Rickey. Colonel Fitts is a 'stereotypical' military man, full of homophobia. Barbara Fitts is mentally depressed. Rickey has an illustrious aura about him from the very beginning of the film, full of voyeurism and mind-expanding drugs.<br/><br/>
At this point, one is compelled to think we have all the makings of our society, but alas, we have yet to meet Jane's friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari). She is the super-skinny, sex-minded wanna-be model. She tries to flaunt her body so that she can have any boy or man, whenever she wants it.<br/><br/>At any rate, Kevin Spacey is flawless in his sarcastic delivery. In the movie trailer, we see the Burnhams eating dinner and we get to hear Kevin say ""I just quit my job and blackmailed my boss for almost $60,000! Pass the asparagus."" <br/><br/>As serious as the movie gets, it also left me in stitches. In the midst of fights, in the midst of everybody's personal dysfunctional flaw, there is black comedy that is a notch below disturbing, and in this, it should invoke laughter. This movie was well worth the $9.50 per ticket to see it in limited release, and I highly recommend it."

They complain about the lack of lush greenery and plants around the pool.

It is said that we laugh at that which is most true, and indeed, this film touched several genuine personality components that most certainly occupy myself, my children, and several ""lovely"" neighbors.

There is no hero here; all of these people do bad things at some point during the movie. But there's someone here that everyone can identify with.  I was bothered by an extra twist that's thrown in near the end.  It was unnecessary and made one character a little too implausible.  Some scenes are hilarious, some almost painful to watch.  The scene where Spacey works a fast food drive thru window should be reason enough to nominate him for the Oscar.  Annette Bening should be a favorite to win best actress.

","In case there was any doubt that suburban life is a brain-freezing chasm of stifled joy and that the well-manicured surface covers emotions that could explode to the surface at any moment, American Beauty comes along to shatter that myth.<br/><br/>The film sets up a typical American family, or at least its idea of one, then lights a match and sets the straw man ablaze, which is all well and fine, if one could discern the slightest message that the film is putting across. If the message is ""carpe diem"", why does it mock the Kevin Spacey character? Get in touch with your emotions? Something? Anything? There are no real characters in whom the audience can place anything resembling identification.<br/><br/>Well, that might not be true. There is a young man who is charismatic and vaguely disturbed, which means he appreciates Art and Life and Beauty. If he finds Beauty in the Thora Birch character, who is for all intents and purposes a shrill, self-absorbed character, are we supposed to follow suit?<br/><br/>With great pains to avoid spoiling the Big Shocking Ending, which is discernible from a mile away if one squints through the pinkish haze of enough red herrings to threaten Iceland's economy, the message seems to be that happiness is impossible in the sterile, artificial environment. OK, fine. So Kevin Spacey takes a job as a fast food cook (?!?!?...not fine). His wife is portrayed by Annette Bening as a grotesquely repressed caricature, but it seems neither Bening nor the screenwriter gave too much thought to how she got that way. She just is. Deal with it.<br/><br/>There are a couple of good performances in here, sort of, given how unplayable the characters are, namely newcomers Mena Suvari and Wes Bentley (as the Enlightened Oddball Youth), and Allison Janney in a tiny role. Chris Cooper does as well as he can with a terribly written part. Bening has some good moments but brings very little insight to the table; Kevin Spacey is Kevin Spacey.<br/><br/>That said, the movie is not unwatchable, moves along smoothly to the bigger-than-it-needs-to-be climax, and actually does have the guts to follow through on a couple of the themes it introduces. In the end, though, once all the blood and thunder is over, I was struck by how the climax served less as any sort of catharsis, but rather simply as a way to tie up the loose ends. The striking imagery is enough to suggest that director Sam Mendes could make a great deal out of better scripts."

It's simultaneously extraordinarily touching, tremendously funny, and sometimes so unbelievably real that you wonder if screenwriter Alan Ball hasn't been peeking inside of your own home. Everything about the film, from its cinematography to its dialogue to a mesmerizing performance by Kevin Spacey is excellent, but it is the uplifting attitude despite some often very weighty issues that really marks ""American Beauty"" as a stand-out.

"Hubajube","10","0","0","13 October 1999"," a more balanced look **mild, nonspecific spoiler**
","American Beauty reminded me most of Happiness and Your Friends and Neighbors, two other examinations of modern-day suburban evilness great and small.  The biggest difference here, though, is that those two movies were completely about the ugliness and pettiness and excluded any kind of joy or sense of redemption.  In those movies, every moment of hope revealed was quickly crushed.  On the other hand, the glimpses of beauty in American Beauty weren't just limited to ironic beauty!  These moments formed the centerpieces of the film (even though, like the others, the cruelties took up most of the screentime).  This balance is what made the film work.  Even the humor wasn't always relegated to a disgusted I-can't-believe-I'm-seeing-this snort.<br/><br/>I was also impressed by the way it kept this examination of beauty at arm's length, not letting it become overwhelmingly trite like most movies do. Note, for example, Spacey's character's narrative at the end.  While the words seem emotionally over-the-top, his deadpan voice lets you know beforehand that his speech will end with something like ""my whole stupid life"".  Another nice touch was the creepy fixation that Ricky Fitts had with beauty, culminating with the grin that crept across his face while contemplating Spacey's peaceful expression at the end.  I don't think, as others have said, that Ricky Fitts was necessarily treated as a hero.  We were encouraged to laugh at (and be disgusted by) his vivisections of beauty; do you really think we were meant to agree with them?<br/><br/>Besides one nagging hole in the plot (Why would Ricky do anything at all like that in what he knew was full view of his father?), my biggest complaint was the ending.  Ya know, there doesn't have to be one of those whodunit--ha! fooled you, you were wrong--endings at the end of every drama. Did every drama filmmaker grow up watching To Tell the Truth or something? That last switcheroo seemed tacked on and had no impact on the true themes of the movie.<br/><br/>Not a groundbreaking movie at all, but entertaining and very accomplished for a first-time director."

Saving $4 at the matinee would be no bargain.<br/><br/>Before I get to the semi-spoilers, let me say that I give this movie a 10/10.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie one can draw sustenance from in the barren desert of 1990's cinema. Yes, it contains everything we can expect from a studio film; one-line character descriptions, a formulaic-sounding plot about male menopause, PC ideas about hate and being different, an ""artsy"" color theme, a popular lead actor. But the genius of this movie is the way it brings together all these elements to form a skeleton, upon which the real flesh of the film is supported.<br/><br/>First, Kevin Spacey kicks a** in this movie (again). His ability to play the pathetic Lester of the films first act, then lead us through his transformation into a man at peace is amazing, and there is nary a misstep.<br/><br/>There are those who would portray Lester's transformation as depraved (After all, its primary genesis is his lust for a teen cheerleader, and is fueled by marijauna use.), but they would forget the final moments of the film, wherein he discovers peace by becoming so free with himself and others that he finally sees that the family he had come to hate was the truly beautiful thing in his life, for all its faults.<br/><br/>This movie isn't about showing yet again that Suburban America is sick and twisted in its heart, but about the fear of desire, rejection, and love that lead Suburban Americans to pursue their perversions, pettiness, and hatreds so vigorously.<br/><br/>Again, 10/10... And don't give in to your temptation to see it again."

","My favorite reviewer, David Denby of the New Yorker, highly praised this film and I was expecting a lot from it but I was disappointed.  Lester, played by Kevin Spacey in a wonderful performance, is bored with his suburban existence.  It's not surprising as Lester is really a boring character, obsessed with his own personal freedom, smoking pot, avoiding responsibility, screwing teenagers, etc. He's never grown into an adult, yet longs for another adolescence.   If he were just an object of satire, that would be one thing, but I think the filmmakers expect us to view him as a hero; yes, he has a couple of moments of human decency  near the end of the film, but they do little to make me care about this self-involved narcissist.  The elements of satire here are somewhat amusing, but nothing really insightful.  Bourgeois suburban  life is a pretty easy target.<br/><br/>Mostly this is the view common among thoughtful adolescents who have little understanding of the complexity of life. I'm sick of reading about poor unfulfilled housewives in a lot of popular literature; now we have the poor house-husband to worry about.  As I was watching the movie, I wondered how the unemployed might feel about poor Lester's whining about his boring job.<br/><br/>The movie left a sour taste with me--the ""artist"" character was so creepy and morose.  The notion of beauty he advances (the plastic bag)  seems pretentious and a bit silly.  I like a good, nasty movie every now and then, especially if the nastiness comes from irony or superior intelligence (think of Jack Nicholson), but this movie's nastiness is just based on contempt and a feeling of superiority on the part of the filmmakers.<br/><br/>I expected more from this movie based on its reviews. Contrast this movie with ""Dreamlife of Angels"" (France) and see which you think is more profound."

","When I stepped into the theater to see American Beauty, I must admit I was a bit skeptical.  Whenever a large mass of people urges me to run to the theater and view a film, my first instinct is to run in the other direction. For this particular film, I resisted the urge.  I must say I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>A synopsis of the film can be found in others' comments.  Hence, I will forego the summary and cut to the chase.  American Beauty is only moderately Beautiful.  The film is not a profound comment on American society. Neither is it a well-focused, original piece of art.  What American Beauty is, however, is a collection of beautifully wrought moments created by the union of actor and director.<br/><br/>Listening to the words of the film, one feels that the writer is trying to tell several stories at once.  Sure, this kind of  writing can pull awe from any audience, of the wow-I-can't- believe-he-got-so-many-things-into-one-movie variety, but the same can be said for special effects artists who manage to effect a bridge explosion and a monster's foot in the same movie.  As audience members, do we seek breadth or depth?<br/><br/>If you seek breadth, this movie is right up your alley.  Not only does it tackle unhappiness in the workplace, it ties it in with marital degeneration, gays in the military, drug dealing, teenage sex/high school angst, and sexual power, but it ties it all together with the uber-concept of ""Beauty.""  It's a pity that all these cliches don't add up to some larger ""whole"" that communicates something to the viewer.  Indeed, the attempt to do this seems harried and last-minute.<br/><br/>There are some good moments, as I said.  Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey are superb, and the teen actors do a wonderful job of fulfilling the roles simply, without Hollywood ""emotion."" For all the good acting and good direction, though, I wasn't watching a movie; I was simply eating a ""scene salad."""

","By any other name, the film American Beauty would not be aptly titled, even though there is nothing redeeming about the storyline, nor the characters in this film.  <br/><br/>Is it American tragedy?  Maybe.  How about American hypocracy?  Sure.  Or, what about American violence?  Oh, yes!  The title, American Beauty is really a facetious remark that fits aptly into the theme of this film.<br/><br/>While twisted and ugly, this film is beautiful to watch.  The photography is gorgeous.  The acting is first rate.  And the direction is perfect. <br/><br/>
It is the story of a suburban middle class family that is falling apart at the seams.  While we have seen suburbia captured so well in past films (Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands immediately comes to mind), this film paints a fresh new perspective, offering us a hollow landscape of false values and cold emotion.  When Annette Benning waves at a passer by, or when the gay couple bring a welcome basket to their new neighbors, it is quite apparent that something unnatural and forced is taking place.  <br/><br/>Kevin Spacey is Lester Burnham, the father, about to lose his job in the midst of a midlife crisis. Annette Benning is Carolyn, the mother, an eager real estate agent who believes that 'image' is everything!  Their marriage is falling apart and their daughter Jane (played by Thora Birch) has lost interest in them.  <br/><br/>Jane seeks solace in the bedroom of the neighborhood freak, who passes the time videotaping her from his bedroom window.  Her best friend, Angela, is a self centered prom queen, who espouses her MTV values on Jane, and anyone else willing to listen.  <br/><br/>Spacey's character finds himself suddenly in love with Angela.  He quits his job and begins working out in an effort to bed her down.  Meanwhile, Benning's character finds happiness and opportunities with the King of Real Estate, Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher).  <br/><br/>Kevin Spacey has already proven himself to be one of the great actors of the 90's, and this film (perhaps to become his signature piece) only proves that.  He is the films center of gravity.  He is funny when the plot gets too dark.  He is poignant when the film becomes too serious. <br/><br/>
Not since The Opposite of Sex has a film blended so well, teenage angst with dark humor.  While Spacey's character narrates the story, it is the teenagers that manipulate the plot and offer their wisdom.  The adults are merely along for the ride.   <br/><br/>American Beauty is 'laugh-out-loud' funny, and Spacey's character utters 'in-your-face' lines that are destined to become classics.  The film, however, does not leaver the viewer with any hope for middle class suburbia. If anything, we are left to wonder whether family values really existed in the first place.  The film is dark and bitter, and so it should be.  If you have to fake it, it can't be beautiful."

I've never seen a movie with a cast of characters as unique and individual as the characters in this movie.  While each of them was a far cry from being perfect (but who really is?) I felt that I could relate with every one of them, and though their actions were quite bizarre, they were all within the scope of reality. Kevin Spacey's narrative, as well as his performance, was nothing short of amazing. He found the meaning of life (and what is the meaning of life, you ask? It's right in front of your face.) ""I can have only gratitude for every moment of my stupid, little, life.  You probably don't know what I'm talking about, but one day, you will."" The perfect ending to a nearly perfect movie.

","American Beauty was a fine example of neo-expressionism in cinematography, replete with mystical imagery, multileveled symbolism, and of course, a woven tapestry of intermingled lives and the plots that they so graciously generate on the behalf of the director. The glimpses and snapshots of lives filled ""with quiet desperation"" fused with the ethereal impressionist images of flowers,colors, textures, and  other tangibles, gives the viewer a Vance-Packard style white light exposure of fictitious existences in a graceful artistic format, freed from the 60's style concreteness of the film's predecessors. The film is more palpable and yet more transcendental at the same time. This is because the viewer allows himself to be caught up in the up-close n-your-face passions, but still sees the action like a bird in flight,soaring high above the cozily wooded streets below. American Beauty, even  the title is multileveled, on the surface is about a guy who experiences his personal equivalent of the oft-maligned ""midlife crisis"". Is there something vaguely reminiscent of the classical Greek ""fatal flaw"" in our protagonist, or is he merely buffeted by the forces of fate around him.  Did the presence of all of the ""Brads"" in the world simply catch up with him, or was he just a tired middle aged man looking for a pick-me-up in his shabby Willy Loman life? An attractive 16 year old girl is hardly, by anyone's reasonable standards, an appropriate choice for this 42 year old fellow old enough to be her father. But after the repetitive assaults on his self-image, the audience actually comes close...not quite there all the way...but close, to forgiving him.<br/><br/>There are too many subplots and character analyses to get into here, but I did find myself wondering who was the most totally screwed-up, boogered up, psychopathological specimen in the film. At first I thought it was the ""psycho kid"" next door. You must admit, he was weird with that video and all. But then, hey, little Jane bore a striking similarity to that kid in Beetlejuice, dark side and all. The real estate agent and his ""projection of success"" was a bit cartoonish, but what about the Colonel. Now there was a piece of work. It was a pretty close duel for dufusness between him and his brain-dead wife, who obviously got that way through years of putting up with his militaristic craziness. Little Miss Perfect was really a cartoon of herself as well. So, when the chips were counted, I figured that they were all nutty in their own way, with maybe the Colonel out  in the lead. And just then, after the credits rolled and the lights came up, I looked around. And I realized that there were some more weird people in the audience. Lots of em."

","American Beauty appears to be the best movie of 1999 and secures a place for Kevin Spacey into the ranks DeNiro, Nicholson, Keitel, Pitt, and Cruise as one of the greatest actors alive. The movie is near flawless in direction, acting, cinematography, pace, writting, charecter development, entertainment value, and accuracy. Kevin Spacey has the performance of his career and yet it is equalled by the brilliant acting of several others most noticably newcomer Wes Bentley and sexy young Thora Birch. The movie portrays suburban America better then anything I've ever seen and manages to be funny, dark, dramatic, violent, and sad. A virtual roller coaster of a movie that flows perfectly between scenes that are on all opposites of the emotional spectrum. The flow from a dinner scene where Kevin Spacey explodes with rage is hilarious smoothly into the next scene of Thora Birch teaching Wes Bentley about beauty thats dramatic, and finally into a violent confrontation between Bentley and his on-screen military father. The filming of it goes hand in hand with the marvelous directing. The theme of each person seeking out what is beautiful to him or her also teaches the drawbacks to finding it. Spacey does a hilarious and convincing stoned seen. And I'll never be able to get the image of him lifting weights and smoking weed out of my head. I'd like to see Kevin Spacey from Se7en argue with Kevin Spacey from this. (Kevin Spacey in Se7en believed that the whole world is ugly and horrible) (Kevin Spacey in this believe there is beauty in everything) They could each have a partner in the argument too. Morgan Freeman for Se7en Sapcey and Wes Bently for American Spacey.<br/><br/>There is possibly a bit too much drama in it and I could see how some people would say there's nothing mystical about a bag floating on air, there's no deeper meaning, just as there is no deeper meaning to life or anything else into the universe. To think other wise is to believe in a religon of nature, and would be reading too much into a bag floating on air. This movie is kind of too optimistic. But the movie knows that by telling the veiwer the beauty is in the eye of the beholder, to each his own. I would'nt blame anyone for changing their philosophy on life a little after seeing this. Even though changing your life because of a movie is kind of shallow and self defeating in this case. Director Sam Mendes has a good future if continues to direct like this and continues to get such performances from his actors and actresses. Annette Benning, Mena Suvara, and Chris Cooper make the absolute most out of their roles and do more then an ample job at it. This movie has more charecter depth then any movie I have ever seen. You can see how each charecter is multi faceted, and has a personality, and their basic charecter flaws, and how each charecter percieves the world in more then just one way. Each charecter can be seen to have multiple emotions running through them all at the same time, like in real life. When they are angry they aren't just angry, they are angry and scared and happy and sad all at the same time. With the exception of Wes Bentleys mom who seems to be the creepiest person in movie history. And it's not often I use the word creepy. Plus many small details are paid attention to in the movie. Like the poster in Spacey's garage of the pot leaf and colors. Posters such as that are usually a staple of any free whelling pot smoker. The messy garage with shelves cluttered with junk is a part of suburban Americana. The way Annette Benning treats her couch is how lot of people are about couches, again Kevin Spacey's first scene of being stoned is truly perfect. PERFECT. He must have really smoked weed to get it so perfect. Just as perfect as the stoned performances of Cheech and Chong during the first thirty minutes of Up In Smoke. So accurate it doesn't even seem like acting. My only problem with this movie is where to rank it on my all time best. Because while it does weigh up to such movies as Reservoir Dogs and The Wild Bunch which are at the very top of my list, it doesn't seem to hold a candle to movies like American History X, or Taxi Driver which are a little lower. But all in all it is a breath taking picture worthy of a slew of Oscars and quite possibly could be one of the best peices of cinema since Citizen Kane. As for me I give it a definate 10 out of 10. And I've seen it three times including opening night."

To a younger crowd this movie might seem ground-breaking and I guess it was in some ways, but not in any way I found particularly significant.

The audience is entranced by the film's look at the state of the human condition.<br/><br/>Many people ask what the film's about.  That's not the point of the movie. The plot's not essential.  It's the characters and what they show us about this world that is.<br/><br/>The film will make you laugh unexpectedly.  It may also bring you to tears. Behind the angst in this film is an uplifting message.  Through the drama is a shining light.  And that's what the film ""American Beauty"" focuses on. Not the dark moments in life, but the fun that can be had in between."

Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his life and the supporting actors such as Annette Bening, Thora Birch and Chris Cooper are also great.  The plot doesn't sound like much and when I went in i was expected to be dissapointed or to be bored but instead I was riveted and amazed at the movie which has heart, passion, strangeness, and even true joy.

","From the opening scene to the rolling of the credits, ""American Beauty"" offers an unsettling presentation of human nature as it pertains to family, marriage, and midlife crisis. The film is as funny as it is tragic. Characterization is so tight that you get a true and palpable sense of all players as they grab you and drag you through this twisted middle class, suburban odyssey. A brilliant piece of work by director Sam Mendes. If you only see one film this year, this is it. Trust me!"

","It's a sorry state of affairs when a movie masterminded by the creator of ""Cybill"" is treated as the second coming, but for once I can understand the hoopla.  American Beauty is a very seductive film -- so seductive that it's easy to overlook the fact that it amounts to roughly bubkes.  It's ironic that the tagline is ""Look closer,"" because this movie ONLY holds up when left unexamined -- under scrutiny, it crumbles like Annette Bening's empowered-woman facade.<br/><br/>What an anomaly!  Scene-by-scene American Beauty is brilliant; overall, it's shoddily conceived, full of holes, and more than a little sophistic.  At the end -- don't worry, I won't spoil anything worth spoiling -- Kevin Spacey's character says ( in voiceover, yech ) something about how we must enjoy the little things in life, and that's basically the whole philosophy here; true child-of-the-60's stuff.  Just to take a small example of the film's many missteps, Spacey -- who has undergone a Kubrickian metamorphosis from downsized sadsack to teenager reborn -- makes a break with his materialistic, status-seeking past by... Buying a car?  Drinking beer? EXERCISING?  Excuse me, but isn't that what yuppies do?  And there's a mistake within a mistake here, because no one who has suddenly become a fitness nut would also become a drunkard at the same time, even if he is trying to show his wife how liberated he is.<br/><br/>As for the director, Sam Mendes, let's just say that the guy definitely knows his way around a camera but fudges a few things, most notably the substory of Spacey's crush on his daughter's best friend.  Middle-aged men who want to prong underaged girls generally do not fantasize about them shooting rose petals from their chests, not even if those middle-aged men are professional poets, which Lester -- who writes ad copy -- is most assuredly not.  Subliminal cuts of the girl in various pornographic poses would have been more honest, but then again, this movie is about as edgy as a donut, despite what the critics will tell you, and always opts for prettiness over provocation.<br/><br/>Now for the good news:  American Beauty is a rare case of a film where the actors are more important than anyone behind the camera, and all the actors -- except Annette Bening, who appears to have been coached by a different director than everyone else, perhaps Friz Freleng -- rise to the occasion admirably.  Especially Kevin Spacey.  He has been impressive before, of course, but here he's simply... Well, ""Voila un homme,"" to quote Napoleon. He's the essence of humanity, as hyperbolic as that sounds.  Thank god for this man who doesn't indulge in Oscar moments, never cries, never speechifies, just radiates intelligence and common sense and joy in his own talent.  His performance and character make the movie great, even though it's not a great movie, and he has now officially paid Pacino back for his reported rudeness on the set of Glengarry Glen Ross by becoming a much better actor.  Headhunters of the press, DO NOT ask this man if he's gay again -- he needs to be free to play whoever he wants.  Julia Roberts already has her tart-tongued sidekick, okay?  Leave the guy alone.<br/><br/>The high school scenes in American Beauty were shot at my alma mater, by the way.  I don't know why I feel compelled to mention this but I do.  I almost fainted dead away at the sight of those Spartanettes.  Ah, the memories..."

"Christie-10","Null","0","0","8 October 1999"," Slightly sexist; ""Our Town"" remake?
","[DON'T READ THIS IF YOU'VE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE] I did not find characters of the wife or the slutty girlfriend to be sexist, but I was bothered that the daughter (Thora Birch) resolved her questions about life by going off with the classic type of movie and romance novel hero:  tall, good-looking, wise beyond his years, confident, and well-heeled.  The fact that he's also a voyeuristic drug dealer is just a 90s twist.  He's presented as wonderful as Gary Grant, Sean Connery, or Harrison Ford ever were.  The daughter gets to tag along in life with this supreme being, while who she is and what her talents might be are left out or to the imagination.  I don't see this as a major flaw in the movie, but I wish for a little more self-actualization and autonomy from the hapless daughter.  If the neighbor boy was able to become as incredibly self-possessed and wise even while living in the hell hole of his dysfunctional family, why couldn't we see the daughter be portrayed as more than a pawn and a passive ward, first of her parents and then of this perfect man's love?<br/><br/>I do agree that the character of Ricky Fitts is too good to be true and has inherent contradictions.  I appreciated the IMDb post that gave a clinical and psychological explanation of what I sensed instinctively.<br/><br/>
Have you ever seen Thornton Wilder's ""Our Town""?  I had the thought after seeing American Beauty that this was a 90s remake of that 1930s(?) play. The movie's portrayal of the dynamics of a nuclear family, a neighborhood romance, all in the context of an all-American culture echo the play.  And the ending scenario is the same:  A person after death marvels at life and exhorts the audience to appreciate every moment."

","A couple days ago, I saw an advance screening of the movie ""American Beauty"". It is an amazing film. <br/><br/>The ending of the movie is intentionally given away in the opening minute, which really threw me at first. But it actually makes the rest of the film more powerful by continuing to keep you on your toes as you await a certain character's fate. Basically, American Beauty is the story of a family that is pretty darn disfunctional, but is really not all that much different than many families in suburban America.<br/><br/>The movie features a remarkable performance by Kevin Spacey. He is gonna get an Oscar nomination for it, I have no doubt. The physical and emotional changes his character undergoes are just stunning. I was also very impressed with youngster Thora Birch, who shows that a slight smile and no makeup can be beautiful and sexy in a way that the perfect blonde bombshells from Hollywood could never imagine. Annette Benning has a sex scene that is among the funniest I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The direction is fantastic. Very stylized and artistic. In one particular scene were Kevin Spacey is dreaming, check out the way he blinks (you will know what I mean when you see it), it is a detail that could easily have been glossed over, but shows me how careful the people behind this film were about crafting it. <br/><br/>It is not a movie for everyone. If you are only into escapism you probably won't enjoy it because it is not a simple film and it not exactly uplifting all the time. I does deserve its R rating as it has a little bit of nudity and plenty of sexual talk/swearing, but all of that stuff is far from gratuitous and really works well within the plot. There is also a spot of violence and blood, but again, it is absolutly neccessary to the story. Mostly, the movie is funny and insightful.<br/><br/>Bottom line, I'd be willing to bet that you will not be sorry you saw this one. It is the rare film these days that is actually worth the price of admission."

","I thought this movie was really good, and goes on my top ten for the year. I seriously doubt that it is deserving of the number seven movie of all time (which it is listed as at the time of this review, but will probably drop as more votes come in).  There are two faults I found with the movie:<br/><br/>a) I didn't believe Benning's character would want to shoot Spacey.  There just was no motivation for it. b) As it is today, the movie breaks little ground and seems full of cliches.<br/><br/>Great acting and great direction stop the movie from becoming boring and pretentious.  The characters are fully developed, with the exception of Benning's, which seemed to be developed up until the end.  I think Spacey was really good, but Benning was the stand-out.  Spacey didn't have a ton of challenging material here, and if you've seen him an any of his other roles, you'd realize this is a cakewalk for him.  Still, great acting!  Just not mind-blowing.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Mike-469","Null","0","0","9 October 1999"," A Different View
","I was not immediately swept up and absorbed by this film as so many other people apparently were; I think that that is due in part to the fact that (1) I have not spent most of my life in the suburbs and (2) I have never had a corporate job like the ones Kevin Spacey or Annette Benning have in this film.  That said, I couldn't quite relate to the isolation and anger that their characters felt.  And frankly, it scares me to think that so many people could relate to these characters' lives...  It's a sad commentary on the state of American culture.<br/><br/>That said, I still thought the film was very good.  The writing was sharp, the acting was impeccable (especially by Spacey and Benning), and the direction was focused.  There are many memorable scenes (ie. Spacey's fantasies, Ricky's video-taping, etc.).  Still, the movie had its problems (**WARNING** **WARNING**:  **PLOT SPOILERS**):  First or all, the whole series of misunderstandings that led Col. Fitts to believe his son was gay was just too improbable.  Those types of misunderstandings, (especially what the Col thinks he sees when he's looking from the window) belong in silly romantic-comedies.  Also, I could see the Col's little secret coming from a mile away.  I mean, when a character in a movie like this is so defined by his opinions on one subject, you know he has to be hiding something. Furthermore, I wasn't convinced that Carolyn (Benning) would have really had the guts to shoot Lester (Spacey).  She would have gotten blood all over her $4,000 sofa if she'd done that.  :)  More likely, I think she would have just continued with her affair and ignored Lester and his mid-life crisis.<br/><br/>
Okay, maybe I'm just trying to find fault with the movie just to go against the hype and bring the movie back down to earth.  It's still a great movie, and deserves to be seen.  I'm anxious to see how it stacks up on Oscar night.  My prediction is that this one will go all the way, unless it's died down too much by the time March rolls around.  Oh -- after the movie, it struck me that this would be the kind of movie that Billy Wilder would have made if he were still directing today.  After all, it did borrow the technique of having a dead man narrate the story from Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard.""  This movie's tone and attitude reminded me of a '90s version of ""The Apartment.""  Not in plot, or anything like that, but just in style. Does anyone have any opinions on that?  I'd be curious to hear what others have to say on that subject."

"bopdog","9","0","0","9 October 1999"," Some Oscar acting, but a thin, incomplete, cliche of a movie overall
","Give Kevin Spacey his Oscar now, to avoid congestion next February and March. The directing and writing, though is a little more suspect. Something rang false in the set-up of the story, and the way the movie brought itself to the conclusion. But what, exactly??? I honestly don't pretend to know, but I'll make a guess.<br/><br/>Some of ""American Beauty"" is great. But there the family and the neighbors and the workplaces were ""stock"" elements from a recently emerged indie/reality/'Oh my God how daring' kind of movie making. Ten years ago they might have been revelations-- today they are cartoons of gut-spilling (as in spiritual and emotional exploration, etc.).<br/><br/>What was the point of much of it? And NOT in the academic sense, but rather to me as an audience member? My buttons were not pushed by most of the movie. Oh sure, ""She was nasty,"" and ""Gosh, that's quirky/interesting/arty, etc."" But other than occasional voyeurism or revulsion, my own personal and actual emotional buttons were not pushed. Nothing meaningful in me was addressed-- again, not in some easily definable intellectual sense, but in a visceral, emotional way.<br/><br/>The director was taking the obligatory ""chances"" with the material, but very much like Spacey's character in the shower scene. The movie felt more like the Sunday afternoon ruminations of a stoned, self-indulgent, and frustrated young artist just getting over his first divorce than any kind of real mirror held up to the world.<br/><br/>The kid's sullen, the husband's a suppressed loser, the wife's become a hardened, dried out bitch. Duh. We've been churning that plot around and around since Rod Stieger's 1967 ""The Pawnbroker."" And these days that is such a cliche and such a common TV set-up that it is only unusual when a theatrical family ISN'T that way. And again, to what purpose? What's new here? Or even, what of what's here is being shown in a new way, or even a full and thorough way?<br/><br/>A lot is missing from this movie that I needed for it to have been personally meaningful. Oh yeah-- there were lots of great naked scenes, and a pretty effect or two with the rose petals (and for any Europeans or whatever not knowing this, American Beauty is the real, and well known name of the kind of rose depicted in the scenes. Such a clever, clever, clever play on words: Oh my God, the Art! Quick, somebody get my beret.)<br/><br/>American Beauty is like the emperor in the kids' story: The dishonest tailors utilize millions of dollars worth of the emperor's jewels and gold to make him a new set of robes. They steal the money, of course, but to hide their crime they tell the emperor, and his toadies at court, that the new clothes can only be seen be wise people. The emperor, not wanting to appear out of the loop, walks through town naked, pretending to be dressed in fine duds that he, of course, can see. Everyone is buzzing and applauding the emperor's new clothes, not wanting to appear unwise and uncool themselves. Finally an innocent little kid shouts out-- ""Hey! The emperor has no clothes on. He's naked!"" Then everyone wises up and sees the scene for what it is-- a naked guy who foolishly vaingloriously spent millions of dollars getting that way.<br/><br/>This movie, I think, might be naked. Or at least walking around in its underwear. But Kevin Spacey-- man, what a tremendous job! And the others-- good, too, but without a full movie to act in, their efforts are somewhat wasted. I gave it a ""6."""
"Ray-107","Null","0","0","7 October 1999"," Brilliant portrayal of what American careerism breeds...frustration and discontent
","It plays on your mind for days after seeing it. Disturbing, truthful, painful and honest. Those who haven't seen it..pay no attention to the close-minded moralists who walked out on this film. They think for some reason that it's still 1947. They haven't the guts to look out their own window and see the results of not declining morals, but something much more complex than that. The tragic results of malcontent, blind careerism and parents failure to communicate with their children. The film isn't trying to glamorize these people, idiots, its trying to shove a truth in your face. And its all done so brilliantly.. at times with drama, and at times with humor.<br/><br/>This movie was brilliant at conveying the creeping brooding undercurrents of American suburbia. It's a portrait of why we are failing, and perhaps why we have already failed. This is what you get when you have a culture that isolates their children as precious little artifacts not to be touched, loved, listened to or cared about, until they are 18 of course, and then suddenly they are shoved on the fast track to senior VP. We could learn so much from this film. We could learn from other cultures where jobs are the LEAST important things in their lives. The cultures who cherish family, conversation, community, eating, loving and taking major portions of their day to simply relax and look at nature. When we value community and family and each other, and forget about the Mercedes truck and who got promoted and $3,000 sofas some magical things start to happen...we will start to value our children as real people with real opinions, our families as something to value and love forever no matter what the cost, and mid-life crises might just disappear as well.<br/><br/>And I also strongly disagree with the statements that the films characters are stereotypes or caricatures.

"lulia","Null","0","0","7 October 1999"," A great film.
","I read many of these reviews, and what is good is that nobody thought it was just plain (at least in the reviews I read). It shows that it elicited passionate responses. You have on one side the die-hard fans, those who adored it, and on the other side those who fear for those sacred family values. But that is exactly what this film is about. Working your *** off all your life, being recognized only by your outside appearance and enduring humiliations only to please your boss are not family values. What the screenwriter and the director wanted to show is that what is the most important in life is life itself. It may not be the most original subject for a film, but it's a perennial one.<br/><br/>To comment on the movie itself, I'd like to talk about my two favorite scenes. The first is when Col. Fitts goes to Lester thinking he (lester) is sleeping with his son (Ricky). That man is so miserable, when he tries to kiss Spacey's character and realizes he was wrong... It is so heartbreaking, that man trying to confide his gayness into someone. I almost cried at the poignancy of his despair. A lot of ""closeted"" homosexual persons will be deeply affected, I'm sure.<br/><br/>The second scene is when the young Angela goes to Lester to admire his new muscles. She visibly is in a flirtatious mood, and his very masculine, almost predatory reply frightens her. She was going to torment his middle-aged desire, and he responded like a man sure of himself, not like the pack of hormones of earlier in the film. I thought it was very accurate."

Therefore, EVEN IF the male characters do treat women as 'objects', it does not mean that the director agrees nor is he propagandising this idea.

","Are you happy?  This is the question that is essentially being asked in ""American Beauty.""  Sam Mendes makes his directoral debut in this film that at first seems to be a simple little story, but in fact is a dramatic ride from start to finish.  Kevin Spacey, in the greatest role I've seen him in, plays Lester, a man whose favorite part of the day is masturbating in the shower.  As the film develops, Spacey is searching for what makes him happy.<br/><br/>
Although Spacey delivers as usual, the three younger actors give performances that equal or are better than that of Spacey's.  Thora Birch plays Lester's daughter, a loner who is looking to for her place in the beautiful world.  Mena Suvari plays Birch's best friend, a cheerleader who is pursued by Lester.  Finally, there is Wes Bentley.  He plays Ricky, the new kid next door who loves to film everything in which he believes beautiful.<br/><br/>The entire cast gives outstanding performances and this helps to make the movie so great.  Each character is looking to experience life to the fullest in their own eyes and this helps the movie to continually develop.  I walked out of this movie wanting to experience and live my life to the fullest. It had almost the opposite effect because I realized that there is no possible way to do every little thing you want to do.

","""American Beauty"" is in many ways like a rose itself; On the outside, its surrounded with a captivating beauty, but as you get involved with it, you will understand with great pain and sadness that it also comes along with sharp, nasty thorns.<br/><br/>
     This is not your everyday American satire, instead, it is a stunning combination of family drama, character study, illicit love story, social commentary and modern tragedy. Sam Mendes has brilliantly created a film that displays the true beast that rages behind the walls of a perfect suburban home, and proves that the saying ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" is nothing less than the truth. ""American Beauty"" has many elements that make it work, the main thing that struck me about this film was that even with it's scathing story of two families tragic exploration of moral decay and happiness, it still successfully combined both provocative humour and brutal honesty.  I was  astonished with it's overall sense of sincerity, it penetrated right into the dark heart of American society.<br/><br/>
    Another thing that makes this film soar is it's profundity, I was overwhelmed with it's enormous rush of richly layered meanings and thoughts, you will not believe how deeply it will impact your mind.<br/><br/>
    But of course, what would a film be without the performances? Kevin Spacey and Anette Benning are simply spectacular as the couple stuck in a loveless marriage, Mena Suvari, Chris Cooper and Wes Bentley are equally as impressive. The way this film explores these character's lives is remarkable, there is a consistent tone of complexity and truth in these people, and even though they couldn't be more flawed, we still sympathise and identify with them on so many levels.<br/><br/>     ""American Beauty"" is definitely one of the best films of 1999, it shines with intelligence, imagination and heart. A triumph."

","American Beauty shines because it shatters genre barriers and includes amazing performances.  It's a very serious adult drama, often a laugh riot, and other times an adolescent coming-of-age film.  Composition of certain shots is extroardinary.  (For example, when Lester is called into his boss' office, we see him in the center of the shot; blank emptiness of the room on either side of him to indicate his isolation.)  This is clearly a film which communicates with imagery.<br/><br/>The plot twists and surprises always keep you guessing.  Just when you think you know where it's going, you learn something new.  It challenges, provokes, and stimulates the emotions.  Brilliant directorial debut for Sam Mendes.  Best film of the decade!"

","Up until now Thora Birch has been known mainly for her roles in Disney films.  The cute little girl of ""Monkey Trouble"", ""Hocus Pocus"", and ""Alaska"".  Up until now the most difficult acting she has had to do is in ""Patriot Games"", where she had to act as though she was sans spleen.  But now with ""American Beauty"" she has moved beyond that.  Like Jodie Foster after ""Taxi Driver"" she is on the next tier of acting.  Unfortunately like Ms. Foster she may find the roles available for someone her age not of the same caliber as ""American Beauty"".

His cohabitant Carolyn is some sort of ""bitch wife"" played as a preposterous ""career driven"" eccentric. Their daughter; Jane, is the most coherent of this dysfunctional family and neighbors, and her attraction to the Ricky Fitts, a somewhat deranged drug pusher, only skirts reality.

I pray to God to relieve my anguish and destroy this life instantly if what I view is really entertainment. I was not prepared for this creative genre eulogizing lust and a promise of death with zany interludes of human moral decadence.

I would like to insist on a detail - a way to thank the director and his team for their superb work. When you close you eyes, after the screening of American Beauty, what you see in your mind is ""red"". Red is the dominant color of this film: red are the roses, the petals of roses and also red is the blood of a killed person. Light Red is also the wall of bricks in front of the plastic bag is flying. Red is the desire of this adolescent, red is the background of the dream, red is the color of life - the blood.

","Words really can't describe how wonderful this movie is, and I don't want to use too many words such that I would spoil the movie, but let me say this, see this movie.  It is amazing.  Kevin Spacey in one of his best roles, probably the best since L.A. Confidential. But the person I'd like to focus on here is ""Thora Birch"" who was excellent in this role.  The movies she's played in before she has been the highlight of the movie, in ""All I Want For Christmas"" just being a cute kid, and in ""Patriot Games"" and ""A Clear and Present Danger"" she had a small, but well done role as Harrison Ford's daughter.  This movie however could be the dawn of her future career. Watching this movie it almost seems like they wanted Christina Ricci to play Jane, but Thora Birch is definitely the best person for this movie.<br/><br/>This movie reminds me much of ""The Ice Storm"" with a more comedic twist to it.  The main thing in common I see is that this could do for Birch what ""The Ice Storm"" did for Ricci, being that it pushed her out of the family movie roles and into more adult movies, and broadened her career showing her true potential.  I look very much forward to seeing Birch in many other movies, and I hope that this spawns a great career."
"halnexus","Null","0","0","4 October 1999"," *** 1/2 (Out of four)
","Sam Mendes' ""American Beauty"" is one of the most sumptuously saddening looks at suburban decay ever made.  Although for my money it lacks the even-handed emotional resonance of Ang Lee's ""The Ice Storm"", ""American Beauty"" one-ups the previous film by trading the irreplaceably funny Oscar winner Kevin Kline for yet another irreplaceably funny Oscar winner by the name of Kevin, Mr. Spacey.  Of course many Americans have seen Spacey chew the scenery in such dynamically lively roles as ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Seven"", ""A Time to Kill"" and ""L.A. Confidential"" without ever being able to identify him by name.  ""American Beauty"" should remedy that situation right away.<br/><br/>Spacey plays put-upon advertising executive Lester Burnham, a man with a penchant for masturbating in the shower, ""masking his contempt for the a****les in charge"" at the office and sitting spinelessly at the supper table listening to the insomnia-curing dementia of Tin Pan Alley tunes preferred by his rigid realtor wife Carolyn (Annette Bening). Indeed he no longer communicates with his daughter Jane(Thora Birch), a rebellious young cheerleader playing a nondescript game of follow-the-leader with her model-wannabe colleague Angela (Mena Suvari).  Of course Angela awakens Lester out of the apathetic hellhole he had been entrenched in before, and with the help of his new teen-age next-door neighbor Ricky (Wes Bentley), Lester tries to overcome his encroaching middle age through a cycle of working out, smoking pot and fantasizing of Angela in a heap of rose petals.<br/><br/>Ricky's life indeed is no picnic, as he tries to escape the demented militance of his ex-Marine father (Chris Cooper) through a gallery of videotapes which include everything from a dead bird to a plastic bag blowing gently in the breeze.  Although labeled as an outcast at school, young Jane looks past the superficial ramblings of her ""experienced"" best friend and proceeds to look beyond Ricky's initial facade.<br/><br/>As framed by cinematographer Conrad L. Hall (""In Cold Blood""), ""American Beauty"" has the same falsely bright, almost dizzyingly surreal colors which have defined such similar films as ""Blue Velvet"" and ""The Truman Show"". Unlike those two films, however, ""Beauty"" doesn't try to evade its material through metaphor or Lynchian vision; instead, it stares unblinkingly into the lives of a group of people, each with their own little hang-ups. Indeed what forty-year old man wouldn't identify with Lester as he flips the finger to his malcontent superiors and shrugs off all responsibility in returning to that haven of simplicity, the fast-food chain?  And who wouldn't admire the sheer combination of bravado and insight Ricky contains as he provides his inspiration for Lester?  These identifiable characters form the core of Sam Mendes' debut film, an exquisite find which at times manages to expose an inherently mechanical processing behind its plotting through unbelievable shifts in logic. One scene in particular essays this (READ NO FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!): Ricky's father sees what he believes is his son performing oral sex on Lester when in reality all he's doing is supplying him with pot.  This is a low point of Alan Ball's screenplay, which sketches this character almost to the point of stereotype (were it not for Cooper's masterly performance, one would be inclined to write this mistake off as bigger than it is).<br/><br/>Yet this is one of the few flaws which periodically punctuate Alan Ball's biting screenplay.  Although millions of Americans live in the suburbs even now, very few have the courage to admit their own narcolepsy resulting from such deceptive terms as ""comfort"".  By the end of ""American Beauty"", Spacey's character begins to merit a sort of predestined glory which makes his inevitable destiny seem both heartbreaking and, finally,life-affirming."

Well, after reading 6-7 other comments, and seeing the uncanny resemblances to the way I felt about ""American Beauty"" I felt I just had to say a few words.<br/><br/>First of all, this movie (as others have said) has renewed my faith in Hollywood and movies in general.  I see a lot of movies in my day, and I actually really enjoy a few from time to time. However, the movies seem to be few and far between.  The last ""real good"" movie I saw was ""Sixth Sense"", and although that movie was just released this summer, it was the first ""really good"" one that I had seen in years. Before seeing ""American Beauty"", I feared that I would spend the rest of my life watching ridiculous ""MTV"" movies about teenagers looking for dates to the prom.<br/><br/>But once I saw this film, my heart rose out of my chest with awe, knowing that there are still good movies being made.  Also, another thing I found intruiging when reading the other ""imdb members comments"", was the mentioning of ""Shawshank Redemption"" and how it was the last GREAT movie to have come around.  I TOTALLY agree ""The Shawshank Redemption"" happens to be my favorite movie of all time, numero uno!  However, ""American Beauty"" is not far behind at all!<br/><br/>And one last thing.

","""American Beauty"" is one of the finest films ever made.  It is masterful in plot, story, character structure and development, dialogue, set-up and payoff.  The performances are the pinnacles of everyone's careers. Hopefully, this will be next year's Oscar gem.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey deserves his second Oscar for his performance as Lester Burnham.  Spacey is an actor who lets his character's through-line carry him through the story and it works beautifully.  Spacey is one of the greatest actors of our generation and shows how he can preserve a role and let it develop the actor.<br/><br/>Annette Bening is at the top of her form as Carolyn Burnham.  This is among her best work, including ""The American President"" and ""The Grifters.""  She carries her own weight against powerful Spacey and they play their scenes well with the perfect amount of cynicism and malice.<br/><br/>I remember the first film I saw 17-year-old Thora Birch was ""All I Want For Christmas"" back in 1991 when she was 9 years old.  She has done various supporting roles since in ""Patriot Games,"" ""Clear And Present Danger"" and ""Now And Then,"" to name a few.  She has never made such an impression on me as she has as Jane Burnham.  She has developed immensely as an actress and her maturity, mentally and physically, works well for here in this part. She seems to be one of those rare child actors, like Drew Barrymore, that's slowly making a transition from child-to-adult roles.<br/><br/>Newcomer Wes Bentley, 21, plays next-door neighbor Ricky Fitts, n one of the film's most difficult and challenging roles.  Bentley makes a very sympathetic character, despite what he feels real beauty is (i.e., dead pigeon, plastic bag blowing in the wind).  We, the audience, feel for him because of his heated relationship with his father, his deep appreciation for Thora Birch's character and his loneliness, which lurks within all of us.  He has very nice chemistry with Thora Birch that's always interesting to watch; he's an intense star in the making and I hope to see more of him.<br/><br/>Mena Suvari, 20, makes an intriguing and provocative career move as Angela Hayes soon after recently playing ""Choir Girl"" in this summer's hilarious teen comedy, ""American Pie.""  At first, it appears all her character must do throughout is act bitchy and seductive, but her last scene in the film signifies how good she was.  She plays a cheerleader, who tries to seduce Spacey to reassure herself that she's attractive and above ordinary. I'm sure many of us, including myself, have felt that way before.<br/><br/>Last, but not least, Chris Cooper rounds out this wonderful ensemble cast as the stern, militant father of Ricky who has a few hidden secrets of his own. I have known Chris Cooper to be a great supporting character actor and here is no exception.  By the end, we understand the reasons for his actions, even though we, most certainly, don't agree with the resulting outcome.<br/><br/>Every main character in this film is rather over-the-top, but they were played with such skill, style and finesse that it makes them believable all the same.  We sympathize with Lester because we sense his discomfort and rediscovery all the way to his inevitable downfall.  I understand why this 42-year-old man will fall for a 17-year-old girl.  Of course, there are many reasons why it's wrong, but Lester doesn't so much love her, but the idea of her.  There are no real villains in `American Beauty' and there doesn't have to be. It's not impossible to see Lester using Angela as an outlet to become more spiritually aware.<br/><br/>This film has `psychology' written all over it.  Screenwriter Alan Ball has done a masterful job with his dialogue, character development and his view of `contemporary' American life and its `mask.'  These characters are definitely stuck in `The Matrix.'  Director Sam Mendes has an extraordinary visual style that translates to the screen with beautiful, vibrant colors and set design.  He, also, knows the irony and satirical tone each scene hints at and requires.<br/><br/>The film has elements of other recent pictures, such as `Happiness,' `The Ice Storm' and a little bit of `Office Space.'  Those were three well-made films, yet `American Beauty' exceeds all three combined.  `American Beauty' is an exceptional exercise of the right actors with the right script at the right time.  It is the year's best film so far, passing `The Sixth Sense,' even though both films have very little in common.  The film's closing credits appeared and numerous couples sat in silence, staring at the screen and taking in the experience.  When I went into the theatre parking lot, I watched an empty styrofoam cup flailing about in the breeze.  Right then, I understood what Ricky Fitts meant by beauty.  One of the most beautiful things I have ever seen is `American Beauty.'"

","Kevin Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, the husband/father in a dysfunctional family, in Sam Mendes latest film, `American Beauty'. His wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), is a real estate agent, and his teenage daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), is suffering from typical adolescent angst. Into their lives come three people who will change their lives and upset the precarious balance of everyday existence. Lester becomes obsessed with Jane's beautiful cheerleader best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). Carolyn falls for Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher), a competing real estate agent, whom she lusts after and idolizes professionally. Jane meets Ricky (the excellent Wes Bentley) who conveniently lives next door and furtively photographs her at every opportunity. Of course this is all a prescription for disaster. Alan Ball, screenwriter, has devised some wickedly funny daydream sequences for his characters.  These are all stunningly photographed by Conrad Hall and scored by Thomas Newman. There is a passionate synergy of all these parts sweeping these characters toward the tragic conclusion which is more than hinted at in Lester's ongoing narration. This is only weakened slightly by a rather predictable last half-hour. Spacey continues to add to a gallery of extraordinary performances (Usual Suspect, L.A. Confidential). Beautiful Annette Bening displays her growing range as a mature actress. Both Thora Birch (Now and Then) and Wes Bentley give career-making performances. Chis Cooper and Allison Janey, as the next door neighbors who are even more dysfunctional that the Burnhams, also etch fine portrayals. This comedy/drama will probably be on many `best lists' and hopefully won't be forgotten at award time. All creative hands here have brought an entertaining tale to brighten the fall film season."

While some may not enjoy it, I found it to be an incredible motion picture--without doubt the best I have seen all year.  As I watched the story unfold on the screen, I became totally immersed in the characters, the imagery, the multitude of subplots.  And when the movie drew to a close and the credits began rolling, I felt a bizarre euphoria, as if had ingested a large quantity of psychotropic drugs--the movie just completely blew me away.  I sat there, speechless, watching the credits roll until the immediate effect of the film faded and I walked with my wife to our car. On the way, neither of us spoke a word.  While normally we will discuss what we just saw (as when we saw ""The Sixth Sense"" we said things like ""I never expected that"" and ""Wow, that was really cool""), this time we just walked quietly, amazed.

(this is NY, only a few people in NY movies this year bothered to cheer! and they were wearing chewbacca suits).<br/><br/>I just sat there, stunned, and then struggled to get out of the theatre... not to move on, but to find a quiet place to pick over some scenes. Parts of my feelings matched those I had when pulling myself out of a car wreck that had left me with just one tiny cut but demolished the car... a feeling that I had been in the passenger in an elaborate car crash, but had been handed back my life.<br/><br/>Oh this is all very dramatic. As someone further down says, in possibly the understatement of the IMDB, it's certainly worth $9.50...  there are so many scenes.. to those who think Annette was too stereotypical? forget it! She portrayed the power cassette tape playing sales lady to a T, gun-firing, social climbing, success projecting, secretly crying sales people are not stereotypes by accident. They exist in great quantities. And when she collapsed into an armful of his clothes at the end, she was real enough for me.<br/><br/>Anyway, go see this, dont listen to anyone, especially dont read reviews like this and any others here, and unless you've got some chip on your shoulder, you'll have a great laugh, and if you're lucky, it'll evoke something in you that you forgot movies are capable of doing.<br/><br/>Deconstruct it later if you will, when it ceases to enthrall, but dont spoil it for people! for many people the end of this movie will leave them with the most alive feeling they've had all year!"
"nunculus","Null","0","0","16 September 1999"," Middlebrow elegy
","This debut feature by the director Sam Mendes and the screenwriter Alan Ball seems to move people deeply--it's a haunting elegy for lives of quiet desperation to some. The hero, Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a middle-aged wage slave who wakes up one day with a new slant on life. His wife (Annette Bening) is a success-crazed, sexless android more obsessed with her pruning shears and her garden of ripe red roses than the conjugal bed. His job at a media magazine, he finds, consists largely of ""masking my contempt for my superiors."" And his daughter is as sullen and insulated as a hedgehog, filled with recrimination for her absentee-landlord parents. The joy of springtime only arrives in the form of the daughter's best friend--a snooty blond cheerleader (Mena Suvari) onto whom Lester projects lusty fantasies: he imagines her popping her training bra, and an avalanche of ripe red rose petals pours out. In this seemingly ordinary girl, if nowhere else, Lester finds a way to make his drab life into a Rose Bowl parade.<br/><br/>As directed by Mendes, in the underlining style of early Mike Nichols, AMERICAN BEAUTY has the bland but polished-to-a-gleam appearance of Quality Television. It's like a serious one-hour drama's Emmy submission. Alan Ball was previously a writer for CYBILL, and has a new series debuting called OH, GROW UP!, and the movie suggests the pitfalls of trying to construct a tragic dimension onto characters who are conceived in sitcom terms. Ball and Mendes want to have it both ways--they want characters as huggable and familiar as sitcom characters, but they also want to haunt us with the inevitability of their collapse, in the manner of one of the Coen brothers' what-fools-these-mortals-be noir scenarios. (Ball's script would be better served by the arctic detachment of the Coens' style in FARGO.)<br/><br/>The movie sets up a series of dissatisfied suburban characters of different ages, including the most successfully drawn of the lot, a steel-plated teenage video artist with a savage Marine for a dad (well played by Chris Cooper), who is like a Victorian aesthete with the pressurized manner of a Vulcan. As this level-headed kid--surely an idealized self-portrait by Ball, the artist as the ultimate cool cucumber--the newcomer Wes Bentley gives a vivid, straight-shooting performance that's as refreshing as a faceful of cold aftershave. But as the shlubb hero Lester, Kevin Spacey seems incapable of conveying the sleepy depression of a very ordinary guy. Spacey is all subterfuges and subtext--that's the tricky delight of him as an actor. He makes the audience feel they're eavesdropping on his secretest, dirtiest thoughts. But he seems to have been cast here to make certain things about Lester questionable without having to state the questions outright, and the sight of him leering at a cute teenage girl is far creepier than Jeremy Irons' quivering in LOLITA. (Spacey's one-on-one scenes with Bentley have far more crackle.) Mendes' favorite acting style seems derived from a boffo Broadway show: he likes actors who illustrate emotions rather than being bulldozed by them. The whole movie feels overrehearsed, tidy. (Conrad Hall's cinematography makes diagrammable points.)<br/><br/>You can see why the big cheese behind this movie, Steven Spielberg, responded to the material: Lester is like a Joe Sixpack hero in a Spielberg movie put through ""dark"" and ""harrowing"" paces in the clearest, most digestible way. After the filmmakers set up the characters, there's nothing left except to watch them hang out for an hour, and then wait to find out who will precipitate the tragic outcome. It's telling of the thinness of the movie's conception that the one character who never gets to become three-dimensional is Annette Bening's Caroline; even her moments of yearning and pleasure are cartoony, James L. Brooksish. The movie is as trapped in its need to please, to be ""presentable,"" as the harpie Caroline is.<br/><br/>All this said, the movie has stayed with me hours after seeing it. The sticking power of the picture, I think, is in Wes Bentley's character--his helplessness before his awe at the video images he records. He's the one person in the movie who genuinely doesn't care what other people think of him, and his mixture of ineffable loneliness and determination is affecting. With no irony intended, Ball suggests that the way out of hell for the characters young enough to escape is to flee to New York City.<br/><br/>The thought that bohemian life in New York might not be its own rose-lined prison may be the funniest thing in the movie."

"Starks","9","0","0","4 October 1999"," An American Classic!!
","This film is a masterpiece... I had heard some reviewers comparing this film to The Graduate not knowing whether that was just hype or what.  After seeing this film last night, I can tell you that this is not hype - American Beauty is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen while at the same time one of the saddest.  As the Graduate took you behind the closed doors of suburbia and revolved around Dustin Hoffman's rebellion against society's expectations, American Beauty takes you back to suburbia and is centered around Kevin Spacey's desire to rediscover the man he used to before a marriage, fatherhood, work and suburbia destroyed what he used to be. Spacey, playing a disgruntled middle aged married man named Lester Burnham, is the centerpiece of this movie and he is magnificent. His performance is intense yet never over the top. He is also very funny (Oscar voters -> While it is early on, I doubt you will find a more worthy Best Actor Oscar candidate than Spacey). Annette Bening is also wonderful as his wife Carolyn whose finds her marriage and her relationship with her daughter crumbling away.  I never knew she had this type of performance in her.  Thora Birch is also powerful in her role as their daughter Jane. But for my money the most amazing performances in this movie came from Wes Bentley as Rick Fitts and Chris Cooper as Rick's father Col. Fitts.  Bentley is phenomenal as the boy next door who can see things for what they really are through his video camera. He is perhaps the ""smartest"" and ""wisest"" person in this film because he has not lost track of what truly matters in life, even though his homophobic ex-marine father constantly presses him to become a better man. Lastly, kudos to Mena Suvari who is this year's American women with a great role in American Pie and a nice dramatic turn in American Beauty.  I look forward to seeing her again.<br/><br/>There were great performances in this movie but without a great story there would be nothing.  This script is terrific, it zips along at a nice pace and the dialogue is so witty.  I think it is tough to do comedy, tough to do drama but to do both so well in the same movie is an achievement.  If this movie does not win a best screenplay Oscar - then I wanna see the movie that does win it because that script is gonna have to be phenomenal. Lastly the direction and cinematography was right on the mark!! Go see this movie, they don't make films like this often."

There were so many wonderful lines in the movie that he delivered with such perfection!  He is a genuine actor.  All other actors should go see this movie and take notes. Benning did a great job as well. I usually don't care much for her, but I thought her performance was excellent.  The balance between serious and comedy was well written.  It's a hard look at life.

","All of the actors were great in their roles, the photography was beautiful, the pace just right. It's a good movie, it could have been far better. What bothered me was the characterization of Ricky Fits: his character and condition is the fulcrum around which everything else pivots. <br/><br/>The actor did a marvelous job of portraying him as written. <br/><br/>But to me (a clinical psychologist who's worked with adolescents, pot smokers, personality disorders, & schizophrenics, &c.), the character as written was just unbelievable. It was as if the writer(s) of the screen play went through the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual (the guide delineating symptom clusters and their official diagnoses), clipped out various symptoms from various diagnostic categories, and then pasted a collage together. <br/><br/>The screen play characterization of Ricky puts together TOO many qualities that are typically incompatible. WHEN would you EVER see: continuing pot smoking from a young age with very successful adolescent entrepreneurship?; being a long established & practiced voyeur with a sudden capacity for somewhat warm relating?; severity of mental disorder/weirdness of perception with non-distorted perceptions of people and warm relating?; etc., etc. These writers either have to have been from another planet, smoking something illegal, or grossly unaware of mental illnesses.<br/><br/>All other psychological dynamics portrayed were acceptable or believable enough (given that this is a movie and its story must be told within a certain frame and limits). <br/><br/>But the character of Ricky Fits doesn't fit at all and giving him THAT last name (""Fits"") doesn't make a sufficient bridge to reality: there are plenty of people with mental conditions--these deserve compassion, and they have an almost infinite variety of symptoms--but one like Ricky Fits NEVER, EVER exists."

","What a funny and poignant analysis of my narcissistic baby-boom generation this is.  Not only are the portraits accurate, but, for the first time, I feel some sympathy for this current crop of teenagers as opposed to teenagers in general.  Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening are excellent as the lead characters.  Especially Bening, who managed to make her repulsively obsessive character interesting and three-dimensional.  I actually felt sorry for her as her life crumbled. Kevin Spacey's character, on the other hand, left me cold.  Perhaps if he had done something besides whine, leer, blackmail, and indulge himself, I would have felt better about his general kindness.  His performance was engaging and believable, but other than retrieving the plate of asparagus, nothing he did made me want to root for him.<br/><br/>Chris Cooper did his usual outstanding job playing complex individuals with inner demons, but Wes Bentley was the standout in this film.  His portrayal of an intense controlled teenager who found beauty in death and emptiness defined the film for me.  It was nice to have Thora Birch, a first-class teenage actress, playing the sanest member of the cast.  Birch and Bentley together made me care about the devastation wrought by their self-involved, if not catatonic, parents.<br/><br/>When I first left the theater, I thought the ending was too contrived and off-handed.  Over time as I replayed the scenes in my mind, it made more sense to me.  Each adult had been struggling so long to survive and to keep up appearances that they had forgotten why they bothered to do so. Somewhere they had lost whatever was of value in their lives.  Now, like Ricky's dancing bag, they were all just twisting in the wind and dragging their children along with them until the wind stopped blowing."

As portrayed in the film, most of us are sleepwalking through life, not really *living*. The character of the neighbor boy is out of place (and thus must leave) because he is the only one who *sees* everything -- both the beauty (the white bag) and the ugly and violent (death). It's all part of life, but within our suburban cocoon, we see none of that.

"silvrmn","Null","0","0","3 October 1999"," An older man's perspective on this incredible film
","Writing as a 55-year old man who's had more than one mid-life crisis, I think I know a little about what Kevin Spacey was going through in the last year of his life.  So many of the reviews I've read on-line and in the papers are from the point of view of younger people - people who haven't been knocked around by life very much yet.  They cop an attitude and fail to see the essential truth of each of the characters in the story.<br/><br/>
I've known a great many real estate brokers, for instance.  Annette Bening's character is not over the edge.  If anything, she's typical as hell.  Just try selling a house that the former owners have left filthy and empty.  It ain't easy, folks.  Of course she has to pump herself up to do it.  And when she endures rejection from a stream of losers who look like they probably couldn't afford the place anyhow, her tears are very, very real.<br/><br/>And what's the deal with the shock and outrage that I've seen expressed over Kevin Spacey's character's fantasies about his daughter's friend, the blonde cheerleader?  Hey, that's the way men are wired up.  A drop-dead gorgeous young girl summons up all sorts of emotions in an older man.  Pedophilic emotions?  (There, I said it.)  Yes and no.  On the one hand he'd love to be able to have sex with her.  (""Making love"" is not the sort of experience that she represents to him.)  But on the other hand, and waaay more importantly, that kind of girl represents ""lost youth"" more dramatically than any number of theatrical metaphors could.  And that's exactly what a mid-life crisis is all about, isn't it?  Failing powers: physical, sexual, and - for Spacey and many of the men he represents - the loss of joy in life.  She's just the trigger, the splash of cold water, that wakes him from his coma.<br/><br/>Even Spacey's attempts at rapproachment with his daughter ring true.  Ask any father of a teenaged girl and you'll learn that their adolescence marked their withdrawal from their former closeness with their father.  More than a withdrawal, there is that whole package of contempt, angst, and hostility for what the father (and often, mother) represent.  Adolescent rebellion against familial control is a cliche that's true, even though it appears to be well-justified in this particular family.  Had Spacey's character lived longer, he'd have learned that this passes to be replaced with a new kind of familial closeness as his daughter entered her 20's.<br/><br/>I've known men who in their 40's were ready to throw away their entire past lives for a last shot at youth.  Some actually did it.  Others entertained the notion, and an ""entertaining"" notion it is.  And one died from it. Honest.  It killed him.  Twenty-five years ago I was working for a man who had just turned 40.  He had a successful business, a 20-year marriage, two children, a house in the suburbs, and a beautiful, blonde secretary.  She was sweet, understanding, a college grad with a degree in piano who could play wonderfully.  But she was 25 and he was 40 and overweight.  So he started swimming two miles a day at his club and eating a fat-free diet. They went to lunch together a lot.  Eventually, he found excuses to stay in the city overnight - at his club, he told his wife - but really at the secretary's apartment.  He bought a red convertible.  He threw out his old Brooks Brothers suits and bought a stylish new wardrobe.  He lost forty pounds and toned-up.  He saw a psychiatrist twice a week to try to get to the root of the stress and rage and unhappiness he felt so often.<br/><br/>
On the Thursday before the weekend on which he planned to tell his wife that he was leaving her, he was sitting in the sauna at his club.  The guys in the sauna were complimenting him on how good he was looking and asking him how he did it.  He told them that part of it was isometric exercises.  To demonstrate how it worked he showed them how he could tense-up his body even when he was driving his car during the commute.  And at that instant, when he was tensed, he toppled off the bench and - according to the coroner - was dead before he hit the ground with a massive coronary.<br/><br/>
He died of a mid-life crisis.  The stress of his impending confrontation with his wife was the proximal cause, sure as hell.  Not that his wife or family ever knew this.<br/><br/>So I guess now you all might understand why ""American Beauty"" rang so many bells for me.  The final coda was not ""over the top"" or ""manipulative"" as I've seen it referred to: it was Pure Revealed Truth.  Ignore it at your own risk."

","AMERICAN BEAUTY is one of those rare films that is shot following a screenplay, yet the way the film was made, at times you think it was real.  It's a movie that looks at the typical American family of the 1990's, which is usually disfunctional. And it also helps the viewer find the ""hidden"" beauties in life that not many people see or they're just too busy to see.      Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a employee at a advertising company who feels that his life has come to a dead-end.  Lester tells the viewer that his life is empty, and the only excitement he gets everyday is when he ""pleasures"" himself while in the shower.  Annette Benning plays his wife, Carolyn Burnham, a real estate agent who wants life to be perfect, a<br/><br/>perfect family, a perfect marriage, a perfect job, and a perfect lifestyle. Unfortunate for Carolyn, only the lifestyle is what Carolyn can do perfect, perhaps too perfect.  Thora Birch plays their teenage daughter, Jane.  Because of the father that doesn't give her attention, and the mother that wants what's good for the mother, not for herself, she's become alienated among many people at her school, except for her friend Angela (the beautiful Mena Suvari, ""Choir Chick"" from AMERICAN PIE) and the ""freak"" who lives next door, Ricky (Wes Bentley). Angela has the face, body, and attitude of a super-model, she also likes to brag how boys fantasize her.  Ricky on the other hand, doesn't know many people and is considered a ""freak"" by his classmates since his military strict father (played by the always wonderful Chris Cooper) sent him to a mental institution for two years. It isn't until Lester sees Angela for the first time, that he finally feels alive.  He forgot how good life is, and that it should be enjoyed while it lasts.  So Lester decides to do things the way he wants to do them, which also includes quitting his job. This gets Carolyn angry, and the only pleasure she finds is having a affair with a competitor real estate agent (Peter Gallagher). Jane finds her pleasure by getting close to the boy next door, she finds out that he is actually intelligent, and has a good eye on seeing beautiful things that most overlook. AMERICAN BEAUTY isn't like any film that I have ever seen. Usually a film one have one of these characters in a movie. And usually that one character would be the most intresting person in the movie. But not AMERICAN BEAUTY, all of the characters are intresting, and they are all unique in a different way. I found AMERICAN BEAUTY to be a masterpiece when it comes to character study, these are very different and complex characters.  Yet, when it comes to describing the plot, it's just a story about different people, there really isn't much of a plot.  It isn't complex or thick, like L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, PULP FICTION, and CITIZEN KANE.  Yet that doesn't make it a bad movie, it's excellent!  It's still worth watching.  I'm guessing that people complain that many films today have character's which are just cardboard and phony.  You won't get any phonies in AMERICAN BEAUTY, all of them seem very real, which is why I found this to be one of the best films of the year! ***** (out of five)"

"Eyes_of_Emerald","10","0","0","1 May 2002"," American Classic
","A true American classic!  Funny, unnerving, poignant, repugnant, each character in the movie has their own flaws and foibles yet you manage to feel sorry for each one of them in different ways.  Annette Bening is marvelous as the obsessively driven matriarch of the family. Kevin Spacey is perfection as her husband, who has been literally pushed aside by his wife and daughter.  When he finally does decide to rebel, he does it with a fabulous bang, one of my favorite scenes is (MINOR SPOILER ALERT) when he's quit his office job and taken a job as a fast food employee, and his wife and her lover pull up to the drive-through window to pick up their food, the scene is priceless.  Kevin Spacey delivers his lines to perfection, dripping with sarcasm and understatement.  I was not familiar with Thora Birch's work before this movie, but she has the right combination of teenage angst and ennui down pat, with the total disgust and disrespect for her father as well.  It's not an action movie but it's one you can view more than once and pick up on more little nuances you may have missed the first time.  The ending was quite a surprise as well, I will definitely not spoil it here. A great movie with superb performances from all, leaves you feeling vaguely unsettled but it's definitely worth the watch.  I give it 5 out of 5 stars."

This film leave a question at the end is Lester beter off now he's a pot-smoking dead pedophile (OK so he didn't shag Angela but he nearly did and besides thats not the point) I think he is because it was what he wanted to do and not what society wanted him to do. The best character was Lester's wife, however. superbly acted and bacicaly what every middle class profetional who wants to be upper-middle calls ends up acting like.

At the same time, it amazed me how thoroughly and completely such a huge number of people could have missed the meaning.<br/><br/>Cliches? That's the point.<br/><br/>It starts with a typical happy suburban family, presenting the ""image of success."" And looks beyond it to see anything but happiness. People who work so hard at pretending to be things that they're not that they kill themselves emotionally.<br/><br/>The typical overachiever mother -- who is working so hard at repressing her own misery that you can't help but pity her. The moody daughter who refuses to smile during a steps performance -- who warms up at the slightest attention. The drug-dealing stalker -- who worships beauty in every form. The bitchy model slut -- who has no sexual experience due to overwhelming fears about her own inadequacy.<br/><br/>And, of course, the overworked, underappreciated father -- who becomes to an unemployed pot-smoking pedophile. And the change is exactly what he needed to be happy.<br/><br/>This movie is about looking behind the cliches behind the cliches. About seeing the beauty in things that seem, by societal standards, as nothing but reprehensible. And the people that missed this are perhaps the ones that needed to understand it most of all."

","This is a great movie for many reasons, and it works so well as a whole. The cast is superb with every member giving the screen their all to materialise their characters.  All of the characters are memorable in their own unique context, each having a quote that you will remember.  Speaking of quotes, the Lester voiceover provides more quotes alone than about ten average movies, and this really helps you feel for him by the end (it really is upsetting to see his fate as you knew it was coming from his opening comment).  The film is really clever as it shows how each of the different characters perceive beauty: Angela sees it as physical appearence, Carolyn sees it as material possesions, Ricky sees it as nature and Lester varies as he changes his lifestyle. let us hope that Mendes can keep it up, a good British director is a very rare thing, let's hop it is not a fluke!"

","This movie is somewhat pretentious and cliched, but it's also quite well done. The characters and the basic premise are nothing if not a series of cliches. You've got the repressed suburban family, Dad is stuck in a dead end job he hates and is on the verge of a midlife crisis, his wife is a Hillary Clinton style frigid overachiever, and their daughter is moody and hates both of them. Next door is Sergeant Psycho and his son, the sensitive, misunderstood loner who videotapes everything and has ""insights"" that seem like the greatest mystical wisdom ever to silly Jane, the aforementioned moody girl. And of course her best friend is a blonde airhead nympho, the film version of ""Married ... with Children's"" Kelly Bundy. A blonde bimbo, say it ain't so! And Marine Corps Daddy next door is a rabid homophobe because (Get This!!!) he's secretly in the closet!! Gosh, that's not a cliche or anything, is it???<br/><br/>OK, so there's plenty about this film to poke fun at, especially the times when it takes itself waaay too seriously. Nonetheless, it is well put together. The acting is first rate, and there are numerous moments that are comic genius, most notably, the setup that causes Major Dad to think his son and Kevin Spacey are having sex together when in fact they're smoking pot and the scene where Wifey and the Real Estate stud get busted in the drive through lane at the fast food joint where Spacey is manning the register.<br/><br/>
So, the bottom line is - ignore the pretentious bits where this movie tries to send a ""message"" and just enjoy the parts that are funny as hell.<br/><br/>

","This is one of my favorite movies. It was spectacular! I couldn't believe how well every thing tied together. This movie is great on many levels, be it the incredible acting, or the fantasy (not fairies and dragons, of course) that has become one ordinary man's life. I think what I liked best, though (besides the best lead acting job I've seen since Robert De Niro in 'Raging Bull'), was how two separate and already incredible stories enter-twine into a spectacular ending, that leaves you feeling better and with what seems like a new way of looking at life. This is just me, though; because many people hated it (I just don't think they fully understood, but maybe I'm wrong).<br/><br/>Now some of you out there might be enraged that I put that quote up there, thinking that I ruined the film, but I actually didn't. It's the first line in the movie! That is one of the reason why this is such a great movie, though. It told you he would be dead by the closing of the film, so that made me think that this would be great, because it doesn't depend on a sad ending to make it a good movie. The ending wasn't really sad, but more enlightening. It wasn't an ending for Lester, it was a beginning. Lester's story is about him becoming a man that he likes to be. He goes from a repressed, prideless loser, to a happy, healthy (both physically and mentally), care free man. He starts doing what he likes and getting what he wants (which leads in to my favorite line in the movie, where he goes and arbitrarily buys a beautiful Camaro). <br/><br/>Meanwhile, there is the Burnham's new next door neighbor Ricky Fitts, who is overwhelmed by all the beauty (most of which people would describe as awful), and tries to show other people (mostly Lester and his daughter Jane, who Ricky is in love with) how beautiful life is. Ricky really changes the Burnham's lives. He shows Lester how to live (with a little help from pot), and shows Jane how to love. While this is all happening, Annette Bening's character is being alienated by her family, bu it is really her own fault. Rickies dad is a very interesting character. He tries to hide his emotions with a shield of callousness and hatred for everything he doesn't understand, but throughout his appearances, you can tell the shield is getting smaller, and it eventually isn't there any more (he is a major part in the end).<br/><br/>Beside Ricky, Lester also undergoes a life style change in order to get Jane's friend, Angela (who is played greatly by Mena Suvari), to notice him. He is infatuated with her, and he is willing to do anything to get her. She is a very good character. What I realized about this movie the second time I saw it was that every character in this movie is repressing there true selves in some way, trying to be very convincing about what they want every one else to see, but they are all miserable, and want to reveal themselves. This is the movies mantle, but I think the core of this movie is that life has to much beauty and happiness to waste being miserable and trapped by there own doubts and insecurities. <br/><br/>This movie is not for every one, because it is pretty harsh at parts, but it has such a meaningful point that the harsh parts are able to be excepted (I didn't think it was harsh, but I know people who did). I recommend this to any one who enjoys beautiful films, because I think this is the best movie in 10 years. Enjoy! 10/10"

In my opinion, it just gave the film an air of pretentiousness and superiority which put me off greatly- a ""look at all the beauty in the world that you haven't noticed before because it took this film to show you""-kind of message.

","They say it's hard to write about something you like a lot. Well, I'm gonna try.<br/><br/>This film is really a rare gem, a film where the jury is out: a big hit with audiences and critics alike. I mean, let's face it, a lot of decent films find favor either with audiences or critics - seldom with both.<br/><br/>AMERICAN BEAUTY is unabashedly honest and has a script to die for. I found its handling of sexuality to be forthright and very tasteful at the same time. Kevin Spacey delivers - he's oh so easy to identify with, and is a real hoot, to boot. The script really allows him and the other players a lot of latitude in making their characters transparent and believable.<br/><br/>The casting seems perfect, and the acting is uniformly good. Aside from the obvious kudos to Spacey's bravura performance, Chris Cooper's contribution in the tricky, difficult part of Colonel Fitts is notable as well. Cooper is one of the greatest and most underrated American actors. He deserves more leading roles - one of his best appearances was in John Sayles' 1987 film MATEWAN. Wes Bentley as Ricky Fitts is also worth mentioning. I empathized quite a bit with his outlook on life.<br/><br/>I saw it for the first time alone in the beautiful Tuchinsky Theater in Amsterdam, and it was an incredible experience - I hadn't had that much fun and inspiration at the movies in a long time. Also, seeing it in Amsterdam did enhance appreciation for certain finer elements of the pot... uh, I mean plot.<br/><br/>I suppose that some people will take issue with the fact that the film isn't completely realistic. Indeed some characters, particularly Lester and Ricky are larger than life, but then that is a significant part of their appeal, and part of the intrepid brilliance of the film as a whole. They do some things that some of us only dream of doing, but there's enough of them that's similar to us to make us like them immensely, and take a moment to reflect on what makes our lives worth living.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see Sam Mendes' next films: ROAD TO PERDITION and PHANTOM OF THE OPERA."

","When we all look at our lives, do we ever think of what people on the outside think of what is going on in the inside? Well that is exactly what the film American Beauty allows us to do, take a look at an ordinary suburban family and see how extraordinary there lives really are. What goes on behind closed doors isn't always what you think.<br/><br/>Look closer at forty something ad man Lester Burnham and his status-seeking wife, Carolyn, as their marriage and lives slowly unravel. Lester's wife hates him, his daughter Jane regards him with contempt, and his boss is positioning him for the axe. As Lester decides to make a few changes in his life; the freer he gets, the happier he gets. But Lester is about to learn that the ultimate freedom comes at the ultimate price.<br/><br/>American Beauty is a cinema masterpiece. I cannot remember a film that astounded me so much after watching it. The story of this movie is fantastic. To be placed within the hectic family of Burnham's and there neighbourhood was great. I love how this movie was filmed. Being from almost one man's perspective was just wonderful, in addition to the way the character Ricky Fitts uses his video camera is another unique piece of cinematography. The credit for this part of the film has to go to Cinematographer Conrad L Hall, who did a superb Job. Also praise has to be given to British director Sam Mendes, who did a fantastic job bringing American Beauty to our screens. Both these men deserved their Academy awards they were awarded.<br/><br/>Then what can you say about the cast of American Beauty. In one word, it was BRILLIANT. The star was of course Kevin Spacey, whose Academy award winning role was outstanding. His role of Lester had many touchy subjects related to it, but he handled it with the greatest amount of class that I have seen from any actor. Spacey is a legendary actor. His on screen wife, Caroline was played by actress Annette Bening who was also very good in her role. I enjoyed her performance in the drama, The siege. The way these two performed together onscreen was just great.<br/><br/>The role of Jane, the Burnham's daughter, was played by Thora Birch. She was very good in her role as the ignorant and frustrated daughter. Her onscreen chemistry with Wes Bently, who played Ricky Fitts, was also very good. Then you have the most librated character on the whole film, that of Angela Hayes portrayed by Mena Suvari. Her role was extremely controversial, with the nude scenes that she plays extraordinary. I love the use of rose petals with her character, and the way that both Spacey and Suvari handled there semi-love scenes onscreen. It is a shame that Suvari will no longer be doing these sort scenes since she has had a clause put into her contract.<br/><br/>
There are many funny and very unforgettable scenes in this movie. The funniest and most tense of them all, would have to be at the dinner table, when Lester cracks the sh_ts with his family after losing his job. It was a brilliant scene and one that I could imagine might have taken more than one take. There are many personal scenes played by Spacey that I have so much respect for the man as an actor. The other funny scene is in the drive-thru, when Lester catches his wife cheating on him, very funny.<br/><br/>This movie is also a great view of how sinful our world really is, that is if you believe in sin. There is many situations that a religious person can say that this is the case with this film. Firstly there is infidelity, then there is reference to and there is murder, homosexuality, hatred and bitterness. This movie really does portray what life really is like.<br/><br/>So all in all, American beauty is one exceptional film. It has everything that you could want. It gives a good look at what life is really like. I can relate to this movie, considering my family was not unlike the Burnham's. It was like this between our mother and father, and family for that matter. It was an act for us and there was an act for everyone else. It was sort of fake in a way and it is exactly what American Beauty is trying to say I think. I love the dialogue between Lester and his Neighbour Frank, when they say:<br/><br/>`Where's your wife?'<br/><br/>'Uh, I dunno. Probably out f__king that dorky, prince-of-real-estate guy.'<br/><br/>`Your wife is with another man and you don't care?'<br/><br/>'Nope. Our marriage is just for show. A commercial for how normal we are when we're anything but.'<br/><br/>I believe many marriages and family's are just a commercial, but perhaps I am being a little general and biased in my observation. Anyway this film deserves all it accolades that it got and I am going to one day add to my DVD collection. This film is an 'American Beauty', look closer at it by all means.<br/><br/>Rating: 5 Stars or 10/10"

","""American Beauty"" is a great movie about a bored suburbian nobody (Kevin Spacey) who on on day decides that he doesn't give a damn about anything anymore and starts doing the things he really wants. This leads to some very funny situations, but the movie also contains enough of a message and really shows the futility and emptiness of middle-age family life (wow, how did I come up with that one). <br/><br/>Of course, every now and then things become a little too dramatic or symbolic (I remember watching a scene with a plastic bag being moved by the wind for about 5 minutes), but the phenomenal part of Kevin Spacey more then makes up for this. Other acting is also great, especially Thora Birch as the daughter. And the ending of the movie is quite a surprise....<br/><br/>***`1/2 out of **** stars"

The music is haunting, Thomas Newman could not have done a better job.  And the acting: Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning at their very best, unbeatable. But very the magic of this movie is the way that screenplay writer Alan Ball weaves the dynamic characters and ""been done"" events with wit and incredibly deep insight, an a way that totally redefines ""beauty."" He and Sam Mendes are a team that we will not soon forget. For those who haven't seen the movie, I cannot give a stronger recommendation for it."

","Oscar-winning movies don't always live up to their hype (the Shakespeare in Love Rule), but this one does. I was completely blown away. I have seen this movie probably 12 times now, and it still gets to me every time.  Alan Ball's masterpiece script is brought to life by a uniformly superb cast; Spacey earns his Oscar every step of the way. Each line is perfectly delivered; nearly every scene makes you want to laugh and cry at the same time. The plastic-bag scene and the stunning ending sequence are beautiful and uplifting without being preachy. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.

","the purpose of this is not to praise this absolute masterpiece, but rather to help those to who it was intended.  this movie serves a purpose, and one that i think some movie should have for a long time now.  there are too many people in this society who just cannot step out of their shoes for a few seconds, and just realize who exactly they are, and how good or bad things and people are around them.  if you called this boring, cliche, or you just didn't get it, than I pity you.  the purpose of this movie is to show unfortunate souls like you, what REALLY is important in the life that you live, not your materials, presentability, or money (a road in which we have all traveled), but the absolute abundance of BEAUTY that lives around us. Maybe it can even live in us, as Spacey so truthfully transcribes at the end, and than you are truely happy in life.  Before this movie I was beginning to lose faith in any modern day film delivering a real message. But I have a challenge for anyone who watches this film.  We all have the characters we hate, and they seem to correspond with the type we hate in real life (wonder why that is...), and when you watch this the first time, you really only take liking to those you can familiarize yourself with. The reason we do so is because plain and simple; we don't understand.  We do not comprehend what that person's life is like, and why they act the way they do, but the way this movie is presented, all the main characters well defined, and the more you force yourself to take a liking to all the characters in this movie, the more BEAUTY you see in them, and in life. Only then do you even realize the full reason for the title, and the purpose of this movie.  And only after attaching yourself to all the main characters, do you walk out of the movie theater (or your living room) with a better understanding, and understading of the beauty in the people and life around you.  Personally I hated Jane's friend the slut (forget the name) and Col. Frank Fitz, but the more I looked into them, the more I appreciated people like them all around me.  There might be greater films in this world, and I have seen many a film, but this is the only one where you can truely walk out at the end, with a smile on your face and a glow in your heart, that will last for days to come."

","If you haven't, then see this movie. Lester Burnham is a man, miserable in his marriage, has a horrible job, and is rejected by his own daughter. He's depressed, and ""jerking off"" in the shower is the only thing that brings him any joy. Then, one day, for no good reason, he sees things in a new light. Why should he follow the stupid rules in life if all they're doing is holding him back? This is one thing I love about this character: how he is able to seize his life and start controlling it the way he wants to control it.<br/><br/>I admire the way this film shows life in many middle class families. The husband doesn't abuse the wife, or cheats on her, yet they are constantly fighting. The daughter, who openly despizes her father and mother and is looking for a way out. The boy next door, and his abusive father. All these people who look so ""normal"" when you pass them in the streets have so much more to them. <br/><br/>This film deserved Best Picture, and Kevin Spacey did an absolutely wonderful job playing the man who finally takes control of his life. The funny thing is, I'm only 15, and a movie like this depicts life in my family pretty well. Bravo to the film makers and directors. And to the actors who played the characters.

","Ok, I absolutely adore this movie; it's one of my favourites, but there is one demeaning factor of this movie and is just that it is almost too perfect. That doesn't really make alot of sense to some people, and I have difficulty explaining much better than that, but once you see what I mean you'll agree with it. I think the best way to put it is that it's just trying a little too hard to be a 'great' film. Anywho, all that is DEFINATELY forgiven as this movie just does SO many right things in so many right ways. Oh, I should mention another problem people have with this movie, and that is that all the lead characters are physical attractive, and that makes it unrealistic. Well, I think the point of this casting choice was to show that even beautiful looking people are messed up on the inside and actually usually have more problems than the unatractive ones. This movie is beautiful to look at, and the cinematography Oscar was a shoe in (anybody notice how obssesed I am with cinematography?). Kevin Spacey's and Annette Benning's performances were both OUTSTANDING, and an implicit yet strong theme ran throughout the movie. This movie wasn't about Kevin Spacey being a pervert, Annette Benin being unfaithful, the blondie (can't rememer her name) being a slut or Ricky being a drug dealer. This movie was about all of the characters trying to find out what they wanted, and actually trying to do it! So many people told me they found this movie depressing but if that isn't a positive thing to take from a movie i don't know what is. We could all be a lot happier if we just did what we wanted in life, but of course we're all too self-conscious. In fact, right before the 'tragedy', every character is finally setting out to do what he/she has been wanting to do. Unfortunately one character's worries about how society will view him are too powerful and he destroy's the little tower of happiness. But the movie still manages to be uplifting in many ways, with a hugely positive message coming at the end that really changed the way I look at life."

","It has become commonplace to see a movie take a peek at the average man living in American suburbia; a man with the basic household consisting of a wife, a daughter, two cars, white picket fence and blossoming garden. However, few filmmakers touch on the slyly concealed dysfunction of such a perfect and average family. American Beauty touches on the hidden and specious beauty that is present in the world. Simply said, the film lives up to its tagline, `Look closer.'<br/><br/>American Beauty, a black comedy with many dramatic elements woven in throughout the plot, tells the story of Lester Burnham (played by renowned actor Kevin Spacey) as he meets and fights a mid-life crisis. Between his constant fights with his materialistic wife Carolyn, (Annette Benning) and his dejected teenage daughter Jane, (Thora Birch) poor Lester has little to be happy about. At the discretion of Carolyn, the family does their best to maintain a normal appearance in order to boost her confidence level as she steadily falls into depression herself.<br/><br/>All three family members are roused at nearly the same point in time by a string of seemingly unrelated events. Lester has his dying interests revived Jane's best friend, Angela, (Mena Suvari) for whom he has an uncanny infatuation from the day he first met her. He has many sexual fantasies involving Angela, all of which portray her covered in the petals of the American Beauty Rose. Through his obsessions with Angela, Lester begins to regain interest in his high school past-times, which include lifting weights, flipping burgers for a living and smoking marijuana on a regular basis.<br/><br/>Carolyn has her lively attitude rekindled through an affair with fellow real estate agent that simply calls himself The King. After her affair, her respect and tolerance for Lester's are lowered as she looks closer at his imperfections, thus creating even further static in the already failing marriage.<br/><br/>Jane experiences what seems to be her first encounter with a happy life when Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) moves in next door. Ricky, the son of a strict, racist ex-marine (Chris Cooper) and a cliché military wife (Alison Janney.) Ricky is infatuated with beauty, and helps Jane see the true beauty that exists throughout the world. All she has to do is look closer.<br/><br/>Mendes doesn't really do anything special besides a few noticeable close-ups and a few shadow effects towards the end, both of which further reiterate the already recurring theme of  `Look closer.' It's through these simple effects that his visions of the masterful screenplay come to life.<br/><br/>American Beauty is a flawless film, which truly helps the view to see hidden beauty and dysfunction in the seemingly average world and in its people. Amazing acting by Spacey, Benning and Cooper further boost the film's emotional power, almost asking the viewer to look closer at their own life."

","American Beauty:<br/><br/>	Have you ever just gone through the motions of life? You get your degree, get married, have the requisite child, and then go on autopilot. Day after day you struggle out of bedmaybe kiss your wife hellomaybe not.grunt at your child and struggle in to work. You manage to smile and slink your way through the day and then it is back home again. You struggle through a meal with your wife and child where neither pays the least bit of attention to you and then it is off to bed. This is where it really gets fun since your wife wants to have nothing to do with you at this point. How would this make your feel or act? Better yet how would you act if suddenly you woke up and saw what was happening to your once promising life? American Beauty, directed by Sam Mendes, and written by Alan Ball explores this scenario and the consequences that follow. 	Lester Burnam has the life I described above. His wife, Carolyn, and his daughter, Jane, really have nothing to do with him. Carolyn has become the homemaker from hell with perfect meals accompanied by the sound track to South Pacific every night. She makes a living outside of the house as a real estate agent and seems to be having more success at it than Lester does in his job with a magazine, and she doesn't let Lester forget this. Lester's daughter Jane is going through all the typical high school angst trying to figure out where she fits in and she has no interest in having Dad as part of her life. 	Everything changes the night Carolyn drags Lester out to see Jane and her dance team perform at the high school game. As Lester blearily observes the performance his eyes are slowly drawn towards Jane's friend, Angela. While he is watching her something in him begins to awaken and stir. She is a blond vision of sex drenched dreams. 	Shortly thereafter Lester attends a work function with his wife. While Carolyn is making eyes with the top realtor in the area, Lester comes upon his new teenage neighbor working as a waiter. They end up out back in the alley talking about life and, well for lack of a better word, smoking dope. When the headwaiter appears to chastise his errant waiter Lester is amazed to see him tell his boss where he can stick his job. The creature that was stirred by Angela is now fully inspired. 	Throughout the rest of the movie we see how Lester reacts to everyone that formerly had some means of control over him. The consultant at his job, his wife, and even his daughter are amazed but not necessarily pleased by the new Lester. The movie continues from this point showcasing how Lester, Carolyn, and Jane all react to the changes in life and how it effects each of them. 	Kevin Spacey plays Lester as if he was born to this role. He starts off the movie barely able to move from room to room. The bathroom scene shows how is wife has affected him and his despair at going to work shows through as he is barely able to stay awake. His wife runs roughshod over him and he crumbles. When he begins to undertake his transformation Spacey takes us a little step each time showing the Lester that once was as he comes forward. Spacey's timing and dialogue skills are shown to great heights throughout. He turns a simple sentence, `I rule!' into a battlecry for all downtrodden men. Very few actors could have handled this as well. 	Annette Bening, as Carolyn, also does a fine job as his wife however many people could have handled this role as well. She runs the gambit from total controlling wife/mother to falling apart woman but something was missing in how she did it. 	Thora Birch, Jane, handled her part better than Bening. She had the teenager embarrassed to be seen with the parents down to a t. At the same time she also had her own awakening to the fact that she didn't always have to play second fiddle to her star friend. 	This was an exceptionally well written movie. It did have some `artsy-fartsy' moments in it that slowed some of the scenes down but Spacey powered through them in one of his best performances yet. I highly recommend this film. ***1/2"

","The only reason I am writing this is because so many of the people who have commented were apparently oblivious to the purpose of this movie.  First of all I'd like to clarify why the movie is called American Beauty.  Remember the red roses that keep showing up throughout the movie?  Well those specific type are called ""American Beauties.""  Second, this movie is primarily about redemption.  Until Lester Burnham meets Ricky Fitts, he has been living life for all the wrong reasons.  As Lester said in the beginning, part of him died twenty years ago.  By learning from Ricky, he is finally able to get that part of himself back.  At first he thought that missing part could be fulfilled with erotic desire (Angela), but eventually he realizes that it was all the simple things in life (remember the flashback?) are what he is missing.  This is why it was appropriate for him to die smiling at the picture of his family next to the bouquet of American Beauties.  In some sense, his redemption seems to be religious, although I need not go into the details of that."

","When this movie came out, I wrote on 9/22/99 the following: ""American Beauty may well be the last great film of the century, and this is perfectly fitting. The film, on the surface, examines a dysfunctional family in a 'perfect' suburban environment.  But the film actually wants us to look at ourselves.  Things need to change.  We need to change.  Or we will become 'plastic' or 'sedated' like Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey's characters. The movie is about the dehumanizing effects of 1) repressing feelings and 2) pretending that everything's 'spectacular.'  The only 'real' characters were the daughter (Thora Birch) and the guy next door with his camera.  And they're constantly branded in this film as being 'weird' or a 'psycho.'  The movie really impacted me to the point of actually developing a different outlook on life.  It's that good.  The ending is perfect.  The film borrows from other movie sources like 'The Ice Storm,' 'Happiness,' 'Ordinary People' and even 'It's a Wonderful Life' and creates something wholly unique, funny and extraordinary.  I doubt I'll see a better film this year.""<br/><br/>Well, over two years later, after everything that has happened since September 1999, the film still works.  Although the romantic side of me wanted to change my life like Lester Burnham after watching this, the<br/><br/>pragmatic side of me said ""be careful.""  But it's alright to fantasize, and live vicariously through Lester Burnham (who did pay a price for his ""freedom,"" of course).  <br/><br/>This film, which closed the '90s, and ""Joe Versus the Volcano,"" a tremendously underrated movie that opened the decade, actually work as bookends for me.  The films have many similarities, despite their tones (dark and cynical for American Beauty and light and romantic for Joe). <br/><br/>Both are about unhappy men who find comfort in death (or dying, in the case of Joe).  Lester and Joe both take extreme steps to improve their ""situations,"" and watching their stories unfold on film continues to give me great pleasure, even after the 10th viewings.  Both films are lyrical and quite beautiful, and both require the viewer to ""look closer"" (to borrow American Beauty's tagline).  This is especially the case for Joe Vs. the Volcano, which has been trashed as a ""silly trifle"" by many but is just as deep as American Beauty if you do ""look closer."""

","[Some possible spoilers ahead...]  The thing I enjoyed most about `American Beauty' (**) was that it gives an experienced moviegoer an opportunity to play the game of pointing out all the cliches, stereotypes and caricatures contained in it by naming some of the (usually better) old movies that could have inspired it.  For example(s):  (1) the middle-aged executive who drops out of his job and marriage and reverts back to his adolescence (`The Arrangement,' `The Swimmer,' `All Night Long'); 2) the discontented , anal-retentive housewife (`Harriet Craig,' `Ordinary People,' `Diary of a Mad Housewife'); 3) the rigidly disciplined military man who turns out to be a closet homosexual (`The Sergeant,' `Reflections in a Golden Eye'); 4) the flirty teenage sexpot who turns out to be a virgin (`Lolita,' `The Last Picture Show'); 5) the rebellious son/daughter who hates his/her parents (too many youth-slanted teenflix to name); 6) the voyeuristic drug dealing boy next door, who seems to have stepped out of a David Lynch movie; 7) the gay male couple next door, who seem to be the happiest and best-adjusted characters in the film (a new politically correct cliché); and last but hardly least, let us not forget 8) the supposed horror of affluent living in the suburbs (""Loving,"" ""The Graduate,"" ""The Chase,"" ""No Down Payment,"" ""The Ice Storm,"" etc. etc.). Kevin Spacey is fun to watch in the scenes in which he makes some drastic changes in his life, but Annette Bening is much too hysterically shrill as his wife (the only character in the script who isn't given any slack whatsoever).  I hated the coy and unnecessary way in which the director plays games with the audience over the demise of the Spacey character, and I couldn't help but think that if everyone in the household had just kept their blinds closed at night, this contrived story wouldn't have been made at all.  And then finally, after all the snide cynicism we've endured, comes a conclusion that would be right at home on a Hallmark card: we should all be more aware of the beauty in the world.  My favorite scene: Annette Bening giving Thora Birch as her sullen, `ungrateful brat' of a daughter a resounding slap, something I had been wanting to do for quite some time."

","American Beauty<br/><br/>Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a lonely and disillusioned 40-something man. Working at a job he doesn't like, married to a woman (Annette Bening) he doesn't love, and parenting a daughter(Thora Birch) that has long stopped talking to him, Lester is a zombie in a world that he once had such high expectations for. Living in nameless suburbia, Lester's neighbors are a rigid military man(LONE STAR's Chris Cooper), his clinically depressed wife(DROP DEAD GORGEOUS's Allison Janney), and their 18 year-old son named Ricky(Wes Bentley). Ricky's only love in life is to videotape everything he considers beautiful. The sky, the wind, dead birds, and Lester's daughter Jane are all caught in Ricky's camcorder. When Lester falls hopelessly in lust with one of Jane's friends Angela(AMERICAN PIE's Mena Suvari), he begins a mid-life crisis chain reaction that will forever change the tranquillity of Lester's ideal neighborhood, and permanently alter Lester's life.<br/><br/>This directing debut of Broadway's Sam Mendes(THE BLUE ROOM, the CABARET revival), AMERICAN BEAUTY cannot help but bring to mind the film RUSHMORE, the wonderful picture from last February. Both movies share an amazing similarity in tone and appearance. Both films are the product is minimal studio tampering, and most importantly, both films are the result of directors with fierce imagination and visual gumption. A English director making a film about American suburbia might be odd on paper, but Mendes captures the deeply woven world of BEAUTY with impeccable precision.<br/><br/>
It's the script by TV writer Alan Ball that I feel is BEAUTY's largest Achilles Heel. While the screenplay is wonderfully nuanced, chock full of strong characters and universal emotions, I couldn't help but to feel that the subject matter of hidden emotions lost in middle-class suburbia has already been done way too much. Ranging from Robert Redford's ORDINARY PEOPLE, to even the putrid actioner THE BIG HIT, every other movie these days seems to think it's breaking new ground by suggesting that suburban America might not be all it's cracked up to be. It's rather bland and unexciting, and AMERICAN BEAUTY's best moments come whenever that particular message is tucked safely away. The film has more fun with subplots involving Lester's mid-life crisis, his wife's infidelities, the neighbor's raging homophobia, and Lester's pining for Angela. Mendes has a great eye and Ball has a great ear, I just wish their targets were more original.<br/><br/>With Kevin Spacey, I must admit that I had yet to fall under his charms. While a technically proficient actor, I really never enjoyed his performances as much as the fellow filmgoer. BEAUTY gives Spacey a much needed change of pace. Instead of creating a deeply pathos and dark character, Spacey takes the opportunity to showcase his sharp comedic skills. While not everything that happens to Lester is meant as comedy, Spacey takes each moment and works it for every emotion possible. We see Lester contempt, his pain, and his joy in each close-up. This is Spacey's best performance to date, I hope he doesn't lose the formula in future roles. Annette Bening also delivers a gangbusters performance as Carolyn Burnham. It's a role that is trickier than Spacey's, a character that doesn't invite much audience sympathy. Bening is a pro and works the angles nicely to give us a character that is never a monster, just a woman with her own problems. Thora Birch and Mena Suvari are underwhelming in the teenage roles, leaving only Wes Bentley alone to shine is his lead debut.  Peter Gallagher, Allison Janney, and Chris Cooper are all fine in their supporting roles. <br/><br/>The deep angst that AMERICAN BEAUTY covers is nice for a change. A film that takes some minor chances with plot selections and overall tone. BEAUTY is a film that often could be considered brilliant, only minor disappointment comes when the film cannot seem to keep a even pace. I think Mendes and Ball have created a film that will stir many emotions out of the audience. A thought provoking film told with moxie and care. BEAUTY will forever be remembered as the film that was this close to genius.-------------- 8/10"

Suburbia equated to three ideals: status, unity, and conformity--the ""American Dream"" of a generation that rose up from the ashes of poverty, war, and anxiety.<br/><br/>Unlike the popular culture movement of the 1950s, which endorsed the preceding three principles within the context of such classic television shows as _Leave It to Beaver_ and _The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet_, the 1990s (an era in which the sons and daughters of ""The Greatest Generation"" found themselves in a position of political and social power--Bill Clinton was the first U.S. president to have been born after the Second World War) witnessed a deconstruction of the ""Ozzie and Harriet"" cultural archetypes. In an age of political correctness and social questioning, the facade of status, unity, and conformity (the principles of the ""Greatest Generation"") were exposed for what they truly were--Status, as epitomized in the white house with the white picket fence, inhabited by the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant household; Unity, as demonstrated by a marriage not based on the principles of fidelity, compassion, and love, but on financial need and social climbing; and Conformity, daughters who obey their moms and dads, and moms who cook for their husbands and do not question their roles or the roles of their neighbors, be they two male ""roommates"" or the African-American couple who must be ""moving on up.""<br/><br/>That is what Sam Mendes seeks to show in _American Beauty_. Beauty is a facade and so is anything American. Although Mendes is not the only director to explore this theme in recent cinema, one can certainly recall such films as _Pleasantville_ and _American History X_, he succeeds at getting this point across to his audience because he is not directly influenced by those principles; he is a British director whose purpose is to be unbiasedly and unabashedly didactic.<br/><br/>I give this film 9 out of 10 points. The reason I chose not to give it a perfect score was, more than anything else, the fact that Mendes tries too hard with some of his visual motifs--the roses, the bag in the wind, and the young, virginal cheerleader. Both Spacey and Bening turn in accomplished performances as the antithesis of Ozzie and Harriet Nelson, and Thora Birch successfully demonstrates that ""Wednesday Addams"" does exist in the ""perfect"" world. _American Beauty_ will be disheartening, especially if you understand the commentary it makes, but to fully appreciate it, you must realize its goal: the facade isn't all that beautiful . . . in America."

","This film hit me the first time i saw it.  Not being able to watch it all at once (for various reasons) I was pretty disapointed coming away from the first half, but i see now why it needs to be watched properly.  This isnt a comment on society as so many people think it is, but i saw it simpley as a story of a man trying to escape himself and what he has become.  Whether this happens to other people is irrelivent.  At first i wasnt sure about the casting of kevin spacey, and although he was excellent im not sure he was the man for the monologues.  Having said that, a fool could read out those monologues and it would move people emotionally.  The whole thing was brilliantly written, and looking back, it has to be one of my favorite films.  I dont quite know why the shawshank redemption music* was played at certain points, but in both films, it is effective in what it is there to do.  Whether or not you think you'll like it, you should watch it.<br/><br/>*dont have a clue what it's called, but the piano music played when Jane it undressing, and on and off after that in american beauty, and both when Brooks's letter is read out and when red gives the monologue after he is let out of prison.

Thora Birch also gave a powerful performance. Mena Suvari was good, but not worth a nod at the Oscars. I think Thora Brich should have gotten a nod for this.

"Gorilla Punk","10","0","0","19 January 2002"," By far, the deepest movie EVER
","American Beauty has got to be the best movie ever.  Better than Citizen Kane, Star Wars, Casablanca, any movie.  First of all, it is so simple. No epic war sequences, no fancy symphonies, it's just the story of a suburban family.  Yet, there is so much to learn from this movie. I have never been the same since seeing this movie.  This movie has helped me realize what beauty truly is.  Beauty isn't just good lucks.  Beauty is anything that strikes you as amazing.  Beauty uplifts. The story is about Lester Burnham, a somewhat-disgruntled middle-aged dad, who gains a second wind in life after meeting his daughter's cheerleading friend Angela.  A forty-two year old dad and a high school cheerleader are perhaps the most unlikely pair.  But the important thing is that Lester realizes that everything has beauty.  And, with help from his pot-smoking neighbor Ricky, Lester embarks on a quest to make radical changes to his life. I liked this movie because of Lester's rebellious spirit.  No social chains hold him.  Lester is free like an eagle. I urge everybody to watch this movie."

","This film was billed as a comedy, and it is more effective as a comedy than any film I've ever seen before. Here's a note to anyone writing a screenplay. If you are writing a comedy, please take notes from this film because the jokes are original. I don't know if I heard very many jokes in this film that I had heard anywhere else.<br/><br/>More importantly about this film, though, is that it deals with something that is very close to my heart -- the perception of beauty. People think of different things when they think of what beautiful is. Some people think of Claudia Schiffer. Some people think of a flower in the middle of a vast grassy field blowing in the wind. Some people think beautiful is a personality trait. Whatever you believe it is, this film effectively deals with our perceptions of the world and how unimportant a lot of the big things are in the grand scheme of things. ""Look closer..."" is what the movie is all about.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not ruining ANYTHING by telling you this, but if you don't want to know... stop reading! It's my policy not to ruin a movie unless I don't want you to go see it.  kevin spacey dies.  He tells you within the first minute of the film in the form of an omnipotent voice-over... almost a voice from the grave really. Now, I really love Kevin Spacey. His films are always intense, and his acting style is to die for. His character is probably more dynamic than any other character in the film not considering that at the top of the movie he is living and that at the end he is dead. Oh, and for you ladies... you get to see his butt.<br/><br/>Annette Bening plays his wife. They don't get along very well, and they don't mind showing it. She also has this obsession with having things very particular. Her performance was a little overly dramatic for my tastes, but that probably meshes well with her character. Certainly you know someone in your life who acts very fake in front of other people, but is a completely different person when not. That is her character.<br/><br/>Thora Birch (the daughter) and Mena Suvari (the daughter's friend) have different views on life and have completely different personalities. Mena Suvari, who you may remember from American Pie, is a very luscious teenage sex kitten. Thora Birch is a depressed-with-her-parents, don't-know-how-to-escape person who is going on a journey into free thought with her new neighbor (played by Wes Bentley). Both of their characters are part of what the movie hinges on, but it is even more predominant in Birch's character as Spacey's daughter. Remember, he's gonna die at some point.<br/><br/>I'll spare giving the movie away, but if you have ever asked yourself, ""what is the meaning of life,"" then this movie will without a doubt answer it. It is very good, and I will definitely be going to see it again.<br/><br/>As a first in my entire reviewing career, I've decided to give this film 10 stars.  It has an OUTSTANDING score, and the plot was terrific.  This was most definitely the best movie of the year (knocking the Sixth Sense down from the perch)."

But for those who can admire a brilliant work of film, then American Beauty is a haunting, riveting, and amazing journey into the depths of the American suburbs where nothing is as it seems on the outside. American Beauty tells the tale of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), suburban recluse turned suburban rebel. After the image of his teenage daughter's friend inspires radical change into the ordianry world of Lester, he sets out on a mission to find his last shot at true happiness. Along for the ride are his cold and money hungary wife Carolyn (Annette Bening), his misunderstood teenage daughter Jane(Thora Birch) and their mysterious next door neighboor Ricky Fitts (Wes Bently).

"vetevana","Null","0","0","13 January 2002"," One of the best movies of the 20th century
","I went to see American Beauty without knowing much about it in advance - somehow the hype had entirely missed me and that is probably the reason I liked it so much. What is great about American Beauty is that it's not a ""one-timer"" (at least not to me). There's a lot more than meets the eye. So far I've seen it three times and I want to see it again. 1999 was a great year in movie industry - I think Magnolia, too, was a great success. More than anything else, however, I liked AB. Not many movies have moments in them when you watch and you suddenly realise you're looking at yourself, no mirrors, no censored scenes, no bigotry. Just the life you live, taken and mixed with Hollywood magic, no apparent exaggerations or over amplified kicks and punches, etc. Another great factor that works for the movie is the soundtrack, a crafty mixture of old and specially composed new tracks.<br/><br/>I think American Beauty is a ""culturally challenged"" film - it may have no way of interpretation in some (if not many) cultural backgrounds. As for me - in a way, even the setting of the movie is not too different from where I live. Besides, it IS called AMERICAN Beauty, which in itself refers to a highly restricted cultural span. Even though it deals with a number of perceptions of beauty, it needn't necessarily be as straightforward to people with a different background. Even though many people may not like it, American Beauty is a must-see together with some other ""classics"" such as Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf and Moulin Rouge. I should think a lot of people disagree with me, though... Another thing that is, in my opinion, quite important about American Beauty is that it's a cinema film. I think that a dark hall full of people laughing or silently staring at the screen when you do is an important factor, especially in forming a first impression. There is no way of feeling or thinking what one feels or thinks at a cinema, in a cozy armchair by a fire place."
"dumbshiznit","10","0","0","17 January 2002"," What can I say about American Beauty that hasn't been said before?
","I can say that for me personally, it's an uplifting experience everytime I watch it. I don't often connect with movies on an emotional level but American Beauty is an exception. Aside from humor, the brutal truth about suburban life, and the interesting characters, I think many would be able to find a sense of hope and peace in their own lives if they can find a way to relate to Lester Burnham.<br/><br/>The story sounds not entirely original. Set in a suburban neighborhood, Lester(Kevin Spacey) is bored, depressed, and sexually frustrated with his life. His job is going no where. His teenage daughter Jane(Thora Birch) despises him for one reason or another and refuses to bond. His perfectionist wife Carolyn(Annette Bening) rules the house with an iron fist. And as he realizes he has little to lose in life, he begins to live it how he sees fit, starting one night when he meets Jane's best friend Angela(Mena Suvari) and begins an unhealthy yet almost necessary lust for her. Angela is only a contributing character to Lester's new found desire to live life to the fullest, as Carolyn makes Lester realize what he doesn't want, Jane makes him realize what should be important, and new neighbor Ricky Fitts(Wes Bentley) brings back Lester's youth in a sense, and you see how Ricky himself is like a younger version of Lester. Ricky himself seems to express much of an artistic side, which at times seems exaggerated, but still in a way that you can enjoy it, and think about your own life. The most meaningful scene to me is towards the end, through out all of the suffering and pain, Angela asks Lester how he is doing, and Lester grins and realizes that he is doing well, and says he is great. This is a movie I watch whenever I need to feel better, and so far, it hasn't failed me yet. I haven't begun to describe this movie as far as the story goes, just what it expresses. It deserves at least a chance from everyone, so if you haven't seen it yet, give it a try.<br/><br/>Perfect 10."
"campboy_tc","10","0","0","12 January 2002"," A masterpiece
","Kevin Spacey is one of the great character actors of American cinema, and here Kevin Spacey /is/ Lester Burnham, a dispirited living-by-numbers 40something middle class white American, with a dying marriage and a daughter who has long since ceased to regard him with respect or even affection, living in a nice, normal, boring middle class suburb. Lester is inspired to rethink his life, and he begins to make sweeping changes. Superb as Spacey's performance is, his co-star Annette Bening threatens to steal every scene she is in as Lester's wife Carolyn, driven by her belief in appearances, career and material things, but above all a desire to be in control of her life and her family, who starts to make a few changes of her own. The other actors are uniformly flawless, lead by a strong performance from Wes Bentley as the unconventional, strong-willed boy next door who is, surprisingly, the most ""normal"" of the characters in many ways. The direction and cinematography are perfect, every shot carries meaning, but the recurring theme, reinforced by the design of the sets, is of life that looks normal at first glance, but is often lived constrained by the social norms it observes. Alan Ball's script is brilliant, darkly funny but never flippant, intelligent but never self-congratulatory and moving but never contrived. An unequivocal 10 out of 10, and deserving winner of five Academy Awards."

Perhaps there were tiny flaws I missed, but I was too mesmerized to notice any beyond the slight shakiness of the camera panning over the neighborhood near the beginning.<br/><br/>It is a lost cause to try and label this masterpiece as hailing from any particular genre.  It has comedy, drama, drugs, hate, love, sex, violence and a powerfully positive sense of overall purpose.  It combines a plethora of interesting story-lines that by themselves have dominated countless lesser productions.<br/><br/>Beyond the key fact that is revealed almost immediately, the story is completely unpredictable- the plot twists will steer your suspicions  awry until the very end.<br/><br/>The acting was perfect.  Every character was played convincingly in a realistic style.  I had great respect for Kevin Spacey's ability before seeing this picture.  Now my admiration for his talent has risen to a new level.  He assumed the role of a lifetime and shined as bright as a star can.<br/><br/>My only regret is that I fear I might never see anything better.  I feel as though I've climbed the highest mountain of cinema and anything else will pale in comparison.  Yet, I will never regret having watched it and I hope to view it many more times.<br/><br/>The message this rose of a film so effectively delivers is that what is truly beautiful about life becomes obscured as we become consumed by all of the negative, as we endeavor fruitlessly for security and a firm grasp on our destinies.  Instead, it suggests we should cherish the joyful experiences of our pasts, look above the pain of all the thorns and take the time to appreciate what is gorgeous about the here and now.<br/><br/>It is a given that not everyone will be as floored as I was.  Some will inevitably find much of the subject matter offensive. Those of the opinion that film noir reigns supreme are sure to have issues with my assessment as well.  Still, unless you are completely repulsed by some of the content you will be extremely hard pressed not to appreciate this movie by the time the closing credits roll.<br/><br/>In closing I should add that in my own life I have been anything but the positive, hopeful sort to take this movie's message to heart.  If someone else had posted these comments and I read them before seeing American Beauty, I would have laughed my ass off at them and wondered what illicit substances they were under the influence of.  I even did scoff at some like-minded opinions beforehand.  All I can say now is, ""Boy, was I ever wrong""!"

","""American Beauty"" is clearly the best movie of the year.  This is the kind of film where, half way through, you can't wait to see what happens next and at the same time dread that each scene you take in is just leading you closer to the ending.  You wish you could spend forever with these fascinating characters and their eventful lives.  The film is an affirmation that beauty is out there and that it's not too late for any of us to be a part of it.  Physical beauty is perhaps the easiest to recognize.  But human qualities like sincerity, kindness, playfulness, sensitivity, and confidence are just as beautiful.  Beauty can also be found in the recognition that there are some things that can't change, and must be let go.  These concepts and more are conveyed through humor and serious drama -- a difficult combination to pull off, but this film does is superbly.  It is truly a great American film. <br/><br/>23Skidoo-3 made some comments on October 1, 1999 that I'd like to respond to: You call the movie smug and self-important and imply that the filmmakers believe they are better than their characters, and yet you are the one starting off your review with ""I'd rather pound nails through my fingers than watch this movie"".  Who's smug?  Who's self-important?  You've analyzed the movie; now try yourself.<br/><br/>You go on to say that the filmmakers want to have it both ways by pointing out the lack of warmth in humanity while exalting the beauty of life.  I say life IS both ways and the writer and director realize this.  There is beauty in life, but many don't see it (like the Annette Bening character in her older years).  The film is about a few people who've discovered beauty -- some not for the first time in their life.  It's about people changing... from cold to warmth.  Next you'll be criticizing ""Terminator 2"" for portraying cyborgs as both cold-blooded killing machines and as loyal, tender guardians.  I mean, can't the director make up his mind?  Sheesh, yeah?"

When I first saw this movie, I was stunned.  This film cemented the fact that their are problems with everybody everywhere even though it was set in suburbia.  The issues dealt with in this movie are pretty sick but it had to be done.  I loved this film and it is one my ten personal favorites.<br/><br/>10 out of 10.  This is a freaky film.

I found American Beauty very touching, describing in a realistic way the dark and strange world we live in today. Acting and music score is great too.

","I remember staying up all night, drinking copius amounts of Diet Coke and chomping on butter popcorn. Oh them were the days. Why? The Oscars, of course. For many years the event was the bread and butter of my video shop employee tenure. Don't know why. It's not like it was a shock or anything when the winners were finally announced. Anyone who had kept their ear to the ground generally heard who was going to emerge victorious. My favourite moments were when Nic Cage won for ""Leaving Las Vegas"" or when Kevin Spacey finally got well deserved recognition for ""The Usual Suspects"", having been a fan of his for about 5 years.<br/><br/>So what's this all about? It's all about the world finally realising just what a genius, and world class actor Kevin Spacey is. I marvelled at his performances in ""Glengary Glen Ross"" and ""Swimming with Sharks"" and cringed in complete shock as he for some reason chose to star in the dismal ""A Time to Kill"". Must have been for a bet.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm rambling.<br/><br/>""American Beauty"" is the story of the final months in the life of Lester Burnham (Spacey) and his search for some form of happiness in his life. He's a middle-class, average America who has worked hard in his job for 14 years. The result of this hard work is a 42 year old man with a daughter who hates him (Thora Birch - ""Monkey Business""), a wife who nags him (Annette Bening - ""Bugsy""), and a life that bores him. We are introduced to this scenario by the now-deceased Burnham, which places an interesting spin on things seeing that we view the movie in the knowledge that the lead character will be dead by the end.<br/><br/>In the opening scenes we see that all is not well in the Burnham household. The troubled couple do their best to portray 'business as usual' by attending their cheerleading daughter's big night at a local basketball game. When he should be admiring his daughter's cheerleading skills, Lester instead gets entranced by her fellow-dancer and best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari) which leads the tormented father into a bizarre sexual fantasy the type of which he's never experienced before.<br/><br/>When he meets new neighbour, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) at a function soon after, Lester gets introduced to the wonders of smoking pot. He is further impressed by how the bar employee quits his job in such a matter-of-fact manner when caught hanging outside the building by his boss. Suddenly Lester begins to see that life is there for living. Knowing that Carolyn may not support his new outlook on life, he decides to take things by the scruff of the neck. Can the reckless abandon which Lester has planned really deliver happiness?<br/><br/>And thus is the premise of ""American Beauty"" - the 1999 Oscar winner for Best Picture.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that it is a controversial movie. Themes of homosexuality, masturbation, drug use, underage sex and adultery are prevalent throughout the movie. But for some reason, it never becomes a vulgar experience, or a film that should offend. It is a black comedy, maybe even a tragicomedy.<br/><br/>The performances from pretty much the entire cast range from excellent to outstanding. Spacey of course was rewarded with the Best Actor oscar, and there was a nomination also for Annette Bening (Best Actress). Thora Birch is wonderful as the angry teenage daughter and her strange relationship with the equally impressive Wes Bentley is one of the movie's great achievements.<br/><br/>It works so well because English director Sam Mendes does such an outstanding job in his directorial debut for which he was rewarded with the Best Director Oscar this year. Equally as important is Alan Ball's wonderful (Oscar winning) screenplay. There are many moments where you can't wait to hear what Spacey is going to say next and when he does deliver, it's normally a biting comment that has you laughing your ass off.<br/><br/>Wonderful stuff and a justified winner of it's many Oscars in my book.<br/><br/>Rating ****"

","When I saw American Beauty for the first time in the theatres I was literally blown away by such compelling story telling.  The way in which a simple tale of lost family values and redemption was turned into a visual and conceptual masterpiece was beyond my comprehension.  Never have I sat through a film so enriched with meaning and reality as I did with American Beauty.  Sam Mendes, by far, gave the best directing for what probably shouldn't have been such a visually beautiful film.  And Kevin Spacey gave the acting performance of his career most likely as the perverse and doomed Lester Burnham.  I can truly say for this film, as I cannot with so many of the films today, that a jewel of cinema is forever embedded into the collection of the great films of all time.

The crude beginning may have offended many viewers and may have shocked them, but these scenes intrigue the viewer to keep watching.<br/><br/>The story of Lester Burnham is depressing and tragic, a middle aged man chatting up his daughter's best friend are perfect examples of many sexually depressed men.<br/><br/> The character of Lester, is what men never want to be. Stuck in a non-active marriage with a daughter that hates you and a career that ends up in a fast food restaurant.

"arteitle","10","0","0","1 September 2001"," So many misunderstandings
","My apologies for posting a second commentary on this film, and for including *SPOILERS* (Warning Warning Warning).  I loved ""American Beauty"", but I can see why some others did not.<br/><br/>Other reviewers, both pro and con, argue about whether certain people ""got"" the film or not.  With a movie this complex, I believe it is possible to ""get"" the film on many different levels.  Those whose understandings stayed on the surface, with the events happening onscreen, are the ones describing ""American Beauty"" as primarily a ""comedy"" or a ""whodunnit.""  On the other hand, those who were able to delve deeper into the character interactions and the intricacies of their developments over the course of the film tend to be the ones hailing ""American Beauty"" as a masterpiece.  I will agree that, solely as a comedy or a murder mystery, the film is far from exceptional.  I can even see why people viewing it in these terms described it as ""dull"" or ""boring"".  The murder isn't meant to be suspenseful, which is why it is revealed far in advance through Lester's narration.  The identity of the murderer is relatively unimportant.  Focusing too much attention on trying to solve the crime will likely detract from the real meat of the film; on the other hand, viewers able to ""look closer"" and observe the transformations of the characters will see much more action and substance.<br/><br/>I'll grant that characters like Lester and Caroline are, overall, somewhat unlikeable.  But I disagree with anyone who calls them ""unrelatable"".  Only someone steeped in denial, or those rare few who truly are at peace with themselves and the world around them, could miss identifying with at least a few of these characters' flaws and neuroses.  Who doesn't feel depressed, or frustrated, or hopeless at times?  Who doesn't wish they could drop their pretenses and better connect with, become closer to, the other people around them?<br/><br/>On some more specific issues:<br/><br/>Is Lester a pedophile?  Surprisingly, I would argue that he is not.  In his conversation with Ricky about the long-lost summers of his teenage years, he begins to realize what he has lost from his life.  Though he had spent whole summers flipping burgers, he'd still had a lot of fun, something which is now sorely lacking from his life.  This realization begins his regression back to his teenage self.  He drops his stifling office job in favor of his old vocation, fast food; he buys the car he always wanted as a teenager; he goes back to smoking pot; and, he lusts after a 17-year-old.  In many ways, he has become a teenager himself, mentally (and to a certain extent physically as well, after he begins exercising and loses his middle-aged belly).  He regresses back to when he could still enjoy his life, before responsibilities and societal constraints had put so many restrictions on his life.<br/><br/>Did Colonel Fitts murder Lester because he spurned his advances?  That wasn't how I saw it.  Lester's rejection of the Colonel, gentle as it may have been, snapped Col. Fitts out of his momentary vulnerability, and brought back the shame and confusion over under which he lives most of his life.  For a moment, right after the final, explosive confrontation with his son, the Colonel actually let his guard down long enough to reveal his secret to Lester.  When lester rejected him, besides being hurt, the Colonel's defenses slammed down again and he reacted to this emotionally charged situation just as he had previously with his son: through violence. No explanation is ever given for Mrs. Fitts' psychic catatonia, but it seems consistent with being the spouse of a repressed individual who can only respond to emotional stress with his fists.<br/><br/>After I first saw ""American Beauty"", I was impressed with the magic that Lester works on the people around him.  In their interactions, he spreads openness and honesty (and even catharsis) almost like a virus.  Once he receives the seeds of this self-realization from Ricky, he attempts to pass it to Caroline (who shows hope, momentarily, during their scene on the couch, but later rejects his ideals).  He passes it to Angela, who has just had a particularly scathing argument with Ricky and Jane; she breaks down in his arms, admitting her secret and her insecurities.  He even touches the Colonel with this catalyst, however briefly.  But the Colonel is the least ready to accept this sort of change, and as mentioned above, he responds very badly to it.<br/><br/>Clearly, not everyone in the world is at a stage where they can cope with, or even achieve, this kind of self-awareness.  This reviewer can honestly say that he is not, though he aspires to be.  There is always hope, as Lester expresses in his closing narration; even if you don't yet know how to find the beauty in everything you see and do, ""Don't worry.  You will, someday."""

","For obvious reasons, I don't make it a habit to see twice a movie I loathe the first time.  With 'American Beauty', I made an exception - something so universally praised has to have some redeeming qualities, right?<br/><br/>Well, not really.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey's performance is good.  Of all the statuettes scooped up by the film, his was probably the most well-deserved.  His character was the most fleshed-out (which, in this film, is saying VERY little), and he showed us Lester from every angle.  He made a man contemplating statutory rape seem sympathetic and even downright likable, and that is certainly worthy of praise.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the rest of the cast does not fare so well.  I personally believe this is less to do with the skill of the actors than with the horrible, birdcage-liner of a script, although I'm open to arguments otherwise.  Annette Bening flails her way through the film until she's virtually unwatchable, Thora Birch plays a to-the-letter stereotype of the sullen teen, and Wes Bentley plays the eccentric artiste.  Mena Suvari is probably the strongest of the younger cast, playing on her sexuality while showing enough restraint (which is in short supply in this film) to avoid turning into the sexpot cheerleader cliche.<br/><br/>The tagline is perhaps the most abhorrent thing about this film.  'Look Closer'.  In a film as shallow as this, where the idea of materialism and career being secondary to love of family is actually presented, in all seriousness, as a revelation, the idea of 'Looking Closer' is downright pretentious.  If 'The Jerry Springer Show' decided to use it as their new tagline, is it not still just a show about adulterous trailer-dwellers and midgets with odd sexual fetishes?  Methinks it is.<br/><br/>This isn't an unappreciable film.  All things said, its actually wholly entertaining, but the problem is, its a film that thinks its something its not.  This is whats known as a Popcorn Movie.  Like 'Pearl Harbor', like 'Con Air', 'Armageddon', this is a film simply to entertain.  It's mindless entertainment.  There isn't necessarily anything wrong with that - we all need that sometimes.

It was just like reading a fantastic novel where you can completely relate to the character's perspectives and experiences.  to those who claim this film merely mirrors a repeating theme in hollywood movies, i have to say that i don't know what you are talking about.  i have never seen a movie that shows a dysfuctional American family as accurately and with as much character depth as this movie.  It is very easy to empathize with all of the characters, even the stuck up teenage girl (i know girls just like her!) when, at the end, you realize she too is fragile and human.  Just watching it, i could honestly see echoes of people I know in every single main character. If you can't relate to this movie, then just look next door or across the street from your home, because the same thing is happening all around you.

Kevin Spacey gives one of my favorite performances of all-time as Lester Burnham. A man who feels completely trapped as a pathetic loser in his world (""...in a way, I'm dead already""). Annette Bening is amazing as well as the controlling wife. Thora Birch (an actress who has definitely come a long way since her roles in movies like Hocus Pocus and All I Want For Christmas) plays what appears to be the role of a typical teenager, but eventually grows into something much more than that. And a large supporting cast including Wes Bently, Chris Cooper, Allyson Janney, and of course the always enjoyable Mena Suvari, not to mention the ingenious direction by Sam Mendes make this film completely worthy of all of the recognition that it received back in 1999.<br/><br/>
I haven't talked all that much about the plot and I don't think that I should. American Beauty is a film that requires to be viewed without any knowledge of what's to come.

","Ever since watching Arlington Road, I have had small problems with films which do not have happy endings, or at least, in some way, adequately resolved. But then, there were two things different to this film. Firstly, (this may be considered a spoiler) you knew he was going to die from the beginning, and secondly, it is debatable whether this was actually an unhappy ending. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) played not entirely impeccably, but commendably nonetheless, reached his desired climax - he learns to appreciate real beauty in death. His wife (Annette Benning), played well but sometimes annoyingly to me, did what she had to to retain her 'principles', as such, though we can never know exactly how she will live after this. Both their daughter (Thora Birch), who perfectly presented teen angst and worry, and the complex life that we lead which many adults fail to see, and the boy over the road, (Wes Bentley), who portrayed his double life perfectly and powerfully, reached their own freedom and release in different ways to similar ends. Their ending is not an ending, but a beginning, and so cannot be measured in its 'happiness'. The boy's father (Peter Gallagher), an immensely powerful role, well done, is an exception. He is left confused, angered, enfeebled, and above all, wet. But Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), the daughter's friend, who plays both experience and innocence with equal care and rate finds the right ending for herself.<br/><br/>I rated this movie ten, but I was tentative about doing so. There seemed to be too much wrong, too much not accurate about modern society. But then I know I am not qualified to talk about the issues it presents, and instead rated it on it's enjoyment factor.

","American Beauty. Where do you start talking about a film that has so much depth, so many wonderful characters, such glorious acting, writing, directing, sometimes a surreal feeling, and such powerful themes about our everyday life? For many (my parents included), American Beauty is a trashy disgusting movie about a sick old man and his sick neighborhood. I hate to say it, but there are many who feel that way. And the thing is, they're kindof right. Is Lester demented? Maybe a little? His daughter and her friend talk numerous times about having sex with adults and have some really, Hmm, how to put it, not so Leave it to Beaver-ish conversations. But, from what I've heard from girls, and know, being that I'm a guy, it's very realistic. People do talk about these things because people are curious. Nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>American Beauty is perhaps the most realistic movies ever made. Take anyone's neighborhood, ANYONE'S and you search deep into those people's minds, and I think you'll find things much more startling than what's in this movie. Because, EVERYONE problems. A friend of mine didn't like it because he couldn't find a ""Likeable character."" I told him that's because we know everything about them. In most movies, we don't know ALL about the characters, but here we do. It's hard to like someone when their entire life, all of their thoughts, are exposed. Society today hides their problems for the most part. People cover up their demons and throw them in the closet, and they throw away the key. That reality is questioned here. Lester even says, (SPOILER if you haven't seen or heard anything about this movie) ""Our marriage is for show. It's a comercial for how normal we are when we're anything but.""<br/><br/>All that being said, I found this to be one of the most redeeming movies ever. Lester is a man trapped in a little box called life. And it sucks. (Some may see this as a spoiler. WARNING!) Throughout this movie he is searching for happiness, that's my feeling anyway. He stops trying to control everything and he realizes that he needs to start living. And the at the end (SPOILERS AHEAD!!!) when he's looking at his family picture, his three simple words communicate everything: ""Man, oh, man."" Nothing else needs to be said.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is just top notch. Kevin Spacey is just ""THE MAN"" He always chooses interesting movies, and this film is his best in my humble opinion. He is dramatic, funny, sarcastic, sad, everything. I thought Annette Benning did very well, too. She didn't win the Oscar, and I don't think she should've but she was great. And someone tell me, where was Chris Cooper's Oscar nomination? WHERE? He deserved one. Wes Bently was great as Ricky Fitts, the two teenage girls were both very good as well. Alan Ball's script was nothing short of breathtaking and awe inspiring. He's now writing the HBO series, ""Six Feet Under"" and I've heard nothing but great things about that. And director Sam Mendes, who's now working with the likes of Tom Hanks and Jude Law, did a fabulous job directing. He took us inside the mind of Lester, with eerie dreams and fantasies, and what a beautiful neighborhood that was.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is brilliant. My 8th favorite movie of all time is ""Ordinary People,"" which is very similar. But ""American Beauty"" seems more like a combination of that and Billy Wilder's ""The Apartment,"" which deals with masking sexuality and lying, etc. Interestingly enough, all three of these films won the Best Picture Oscar. Hmm. And I saw a lot of ""American Beauty"" in another great film, recently, starring William H. Macy called ""Panic.""<br/><br/>This film works on so many levels. It is funny while being deeply moving, sad while offering redemption. What more could anyone possibly want in a movie?"

","I went to see American Beauty with considerable expectations; after all, a movie with Kevin Spacey ought to be a killer!  Well, it wasn't his fault, it was the movie's.  Being non-American I can't guess to what extent he symbolized or satirized the average married American midlle-aged guy, but his world sure ain't mine.

Annette Benning is also very good as a suburban wife on the edge of a nervous breakdown. The supporting cast is excellent as well, adding even more twisted spice to this darkly hillarious cauldron of suburban macabre. American Beauty is cleverly written, originally directed, and even though it may turn off some viewers with it's themes of statuatory rape, child abuse, masturbation, marajuana, and murder, it still has my vote for the ""feel good"" movie of the year."

To watch this film and not be astonished and freaked out (to a degree) is to be partially dead inside.  Talking about ALL the great things in the movie would take days.

IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM, BEGONE, SCAT, FLEE, RUN, RETREAT, RUN AWAY.<br/><br/>Friends of mine have said the ending is a downer.  Far from it.  Think about what happens.  Lester is shot dead, and after a short shot of Caroline reacting, we get a series of shots with Lester's voice-over, explaining what went through his mind as he died.  Pictures from the past fill the screen, and he fondly recalls the memories that mattered the most.  Then he talks about becoming calm and relaxing and allowing the beauty of the world to pass freely through you until you become so full of beauty that you're about to burst.  Does this make sense?  ""Don't worry,"" he assures us, ""it will.""<br/><br/>This humble fan found this ending sequence to be almost unbearably beautiful.  It reminded me that, where Lester's life is over, mine is stretched out in front of me.  How many chances will I squander before I come to his realization?  (""IT'S JUST...A...COUCH!!!"")  How many opportunities will escape before I remember to reach out and grasp them? How many years will it take?  One?  Two?  Thirty?  Better do it soon.  The one year you decide to make the most of life might be your last.<br/><br/>I could go on.  But I'm not going to.  If you've read this far, you know how I feel.  Take a moment.  Go outside.

","This is a movie that will divide households.  Either you will watch it and feel as though you related to each character or you will think they are all really twisted people who complain too much.  Honestly, if you can't somehow relate to the characters, then you are probably an ego maniac (""Never underestimate the power of denial"").   The idea here is that nobody is perfect, and the hardest thing to do in life is know your flaws. Each of the characters has major flaws, and that is why it is hard to like them. The process of learning what each character is hiding under the surface will either bore you or intrigue you.  The movie has many genuinely funny moments, and all the acting is brilliant.  It is very rare that a movie this funny can be so unsettling.  So, if you're looking for thoughtless Saturday night fare... you will hate this...go rent something else.

","***Warning! Spoiler Alert!!!***<br/><br/>This movie is what usually happens when mainstream Hollywood wants to make an `edgy, independent-type' movie.   The theme is so hackneyed, the characters so two-dimensional, that nothing in the movie really seems new. Before I get into why I didn't like it, I will say that there was much about it that was good.  It had an amazing look to it, and the acting was good. Kevin Spacey is always good, and all the other major characters were portrayed well, too.   I will say that the first time that I saw it I liked it, but after thinking about it more and more my opinion of it got lower and lower. The characters, every one of them, had nothing new about them whatsoever. A middle-aged family man who begins questioning his job, his family, his values?  Ditto for his wife.  These are nothing new, and were not presented in any way that we've never seen before.  A teen-angst daughter rebelling against her parents?  And the best character of all, the avowed homophobe who turns out to be (gasp) a closeted homosexual himself? I've never heard of that before!  I am by no means anti-gay, but what I am against is trite crap I've seen many times before. The whole message of the movie seems to be `there is beauty all around.' Wow.  I've never heard that expressed before. That is revolutionary. Also, moviemakers do not need to hit us over the head with their messages. We'll figure them out with a little less help. The last big problem with the movie was Lester's death.  After having a rebirth and discovering what was truly important in life, a spurned Marine shoots him? (And what was the point in trying to make us guess about who was going to kill him, and then showing clearly who ended up doing it?)  There was absolutely no need to have Lester die at the end, the only reason I can think of was because the writer's couldn't think of a better ending.<br/><br/>So, I did `look closer' and I found that there wasn't all that much to see. By the way, I was not offended by the movie at all, so that is not the reason I didn't like it."

Very few movies can be funny (the dining room scene after Spacey quits his job is a classic) and be sad & complex at the same time.  I found myself reevaluating priorities in my own life after watching this film, and if that was the filmmaker's intent, he succeeded.

","--This review is written on the basis that you don't mind references to certain particular events in American Beauty: if you haven't seen the film and don't want to know too much about the plot, I suggest you skip this review--<br/><br/>I loved American Beauty.   The first time I watched it was over two consecutive evenings; after the first evening's viewing, I wasn't too sure what I thought of the film, the characters and the film's message to the viewer.   When I finished the film the following evening, I knew I had found my favourite film.<br/><br/>The plot of American Beauty is very intricate - there isn't really one main character: Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) does take on some narration (voiceover) parts at certain points of the film, but the film doesn't solely revolve around him.   Apart from him, there are plots also led by Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening), their daughter Jane (Thora Birch) with Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) and Ricky's Father, Col. Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper).<br/><br/>Lester Burnham, a self confessed `whore for the advertising industry' leaves his job working for a magazine because he realises he's had enough - this sequence of events is brought on because he meets Ricky Fitts, who introduces him to the `power of denial'.   Also, Lester becomes infatuated with his daughter Jane's best friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) - we are lead through his mind as he dreams and fantasises about this seventeen-year-old girl with whom he shouldn't really have any opportunities.   Lester's life is changed by the principles he glimpses in Ricky Fitts' life and tries to start afresh.   However, his family is still clinging on to the old Lester Burnham.<br/><br/>Lester Burnham's wife, Carolyn, runs her own Real Estate firm, competing against the `King' of Real Estate, Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher), who has his own philosophies that Carolyn soon becomes enveloped in.<br/><br/>Jane Burnham wants to fit in at school.   In her adolescent ways she purports to hate her parents.   She is best friends with Angela Hayes, but it soon becomes clear that Angela is all talk - as Ricky Fitts points out, they're not really friends, but instead Jane is someone that Angela can use. Jane becomes increasingly interested in the new boy next door who continually uses his camcorder to spy on her from across their drives.   I found it very interesting that despite the fact that they were becoming increasingly involved, Ricky never overtly spoke to Jane about the fact that he was supplying drugs to her father.<br/><br/>The downfall of the Burnham family is progressively more imminent as the film proceeds with the three members of the family going their different ways - Lester towards a life of trying to seduce Angela, Carolyn and her affair with Buddy Kane, and Jane, encouraged by her parents' examples, relying more and more on Ricky Fitts for company.<br/><br/>I have read through the other reviews on this site (scroll down to read some if you haven't already), and I am impressed by the number of people who really hate American Beauty.   Of course, they are perfectly entitled to their own opinions and I know I shouldn't try to change those even if I could.   There are several aspects of the film that people dislike about the film: (1) Lester Burnham masturbating in the shower towards the beginning of the film, (2) the film's continual drug use, overuse and abuse, (3) Lester acting as a paedophile having dreams about a girl who is entirely out of his league in more ways than one, and (4) Lester becoming childish in taking a job that has the least responsibility possible.   I can't help the fact that Lester masturbates both in the shower and in the middle of the film - the two events are just included in the Screenplay.   The use of drugs in the film is merely an incident - I don't feel that Lester's life changes so dramatically because of his rekindling of an old habit, but instead because he meets this inspiring young man, Ricky.   Perhaps Lester wouldn't have so fallen for Angela if Carolyn hadn't let him become so frustrated - because of this Lester takes up the `irresponsible' job in Mr Smiley's, so that he can get his own back on his wife and prove certain things to her about the change in his lifestyle.<br/><br/>It is difficult to say what genre American Beauty falls in to.   It's not really horror, so we can rule that one off.   Some people didn't like the film because they didn't think it was funny enough.   Enough?   I don't think it's supposed to be funny at all except for those with very warped senses of humour: it's not a comedy.   Perhaps we can call American Beauty a modern tragedy in the true Classical sense of the term - it shows the downfall of a character (Lester Burnham), leading to his death at the end. It's a MODERN tragedy because it's hardly very orthodox in the way the tragedy is laid out - I recently watched a more `normal' tragedy, which I found excellent - it was the two French films Jean de Florette and its sequel Manon des Sources: if you get a chance to watch these films, I would highly recommend them.   I'd be very interested to know your own thoughts about American Beauty - just send me an IMDb personal message.   Thanks for reading the review - sorry it was so long!"

","WARNING SPOILERS!<br/><br/>This stunning portrait of American malaise could have been so much more. As it stands it is a series of outstanding vignettes (the opening, Benning's character's attempt to sell the house, the reading of Spacy's character's letter to his employer, the ludicrious ""real-estate sex scene"", the drive-thru confrontation and the toy car, ""I rule"" exchange) within a discursive mess.  The homosexual and poetic/social outcast side-plots come across as gratutiious.  Especially ridiculous is the percieved gay oral sex scene, complete with a conviently placed window pane and contrived positions (something like this was funny in ""Something About Mary"", but it doesn't work here, because it is not meant to be funny). If the objective of the homosexual incidents was to somehow juxtapose them with Lester Burnam's prurient escapades they fail miserably.  This film works best when it focuses on the theme of suburban ennui.  There are three stories here and infusing them all was a mistake.<br/><br/>
Bottom line, some great scenes with an convoluted story."

","I dunno how you can call a film really good, when it's about the main character having a midlife crisis, becoming a pothead, and a complete a-hole to his wife and daughter, and constantly fantasizing about a teenage girl. I gave this film a lot of chances to get on my good side. When I rented it, it I watched it 3 times, then 2 more when my parents rented it (shame on me for not warning them about this movie). I just couldn't get it, the characters were not likeable, especially Kevin Spacey's character, and the ending seemed rushed and just odd and out of place. Kevin's character turns out to be such a pervert, and we're supposed to relate to this guy? Annette as his wife, even though at the beginning the seems like a total b*tch, you begin to feel sorry for her because her husband is a pervert, but then she goes and cheats on him, and then she's back to being a b*tch. Thora Birch plays a cliched pseudo-goth, parent hating teen, a role which she doesen't deserve. Her love interest is creepy, and seems like he'd be planning to go postal on his school rather than video record everything. Mena Suvari as the girl Kevin is lusting over is the worst casting ever,  I wouldn't lust over her. All of these totally unloveable characters are put into a plot that is just depressing and creepy, and boring none-the-less. The only thing that kept me watching was the fact that Kevin says he is going to die in the first line in the movie, so I stuck around to watch.<br/><br/>WARNING SPOILERS: I think the ending was crap. Sure the dad of the boyfriend acted like guy who was repressing homosexual tedencies, but when he actually came out, it was just wierd and out of place, then to have Kevin killed by him is even more stupid and confusing. And if Kevin had had sex with Mena, I wouldn't even have watched it a second time<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film is depressing, pointless, and feels like it was written by pediphiles, do not let the critics or the oscars fool you, this is one to avoid."

If you are the type of person who doesn't appreciate every minute of your life or the people around you, then you may just need to see this film, and learn to appreciate its full potential.<br/><br/>This film is original and clever in story, interesting in premise, acted sharply by its well-rounded cast, directed in a manner made all the more absorbing, and edgy and humorous enough to keep me going. Before I go on any further, let it be said that an actor by the name of Kevin Spacey rocks! Okay, now that I got that off my chest, let's go on.<br/><br/>How about Thomas Newman's score? Usually I never really care about the score, let alone notice it in films. But, when there wasn't any dialogue in certain scenes and just the music, it also helped make the movie more absorbing. From the hauntingly eerie music that's in the background when we first meet Ricky when he's filming Lester and Jane in the kitchen to the music we hear when Lester dreams about Angela in the bed of roses on the ceiling.<br/><br/>With that said, I feel as though Alan Ball may just be becoming my favorite screenwriter these days, he's very smart and funny and with this film and the series ""Six Feet Under"" to his credit, makes me want to see more films he plans to write in the future.<br/><br/>And whenever Spacey took center stage, man stand back, cause that guy will suck you back into the thick of things, like he did to me! Having said that, this film is definitely a film to be savored by people who are in touch with themselves and appreciate a frank, sometimes brutally honest, look at their pathetic and drab existence. I personally enjoyed the strong performances by the cast, especially Spacey and the friend of his daughter, played by Mena Suvari, the finale, which seemed like it was going one way but then kept curving back every now and again, and the dark humor, which filled many of the scenes. Certainly an overly valiant effort from first time director Sam Mendes, who seems to have a solid grasp on the pulse of characters going through varied difficulties in their lives. So check this film out for yourself and see how you feel. It may just help you appreciate certain aspects of your life much better. Just look closer...

","I've found it difficult to get people to agree with me, but I feel American Beauty functions well in all of the major aspects of film; photography, script, direction, acting, editing, score, production design, etc.  Most of the people where I live have a hard time with the content of the movie; the language, sexual references, nudity, substance abuse, etc.  And although I myself don't approve of those things either, I felt that American Beauty does not glorify them.  In fact, the movie made me feel glad that my life is not that bad.  Admittedly, the characters are very cliche and represent a specific stereotype, but I think I could identify with some of the characteristics of all of the characters.<br/><br/>I felt that the editing between the different story lines was great.  It kept moving between them and kept the viewers interest in the story.  All of the actors did a wonderful job.  I love Kevin Spacey and I'm looking forward to more work from Wes Bentley.  Alan Ball's script is witty, and biting. And I loved the films score.  It wonderfully accompanies the mood of the story.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil the movie for anybody who hasn't seen it yet, so I won't reveal any plot specifics.

","*WARNING MINOR SPOILERS* It seems that those who didn't like this film either belong to the same middle-class complacent stereotype as Lester Burnham and his family, are complete outsiders, or take too much from the scenes overflowing with teenage angst. Yes, these characters are stereotypical. The film does NOT pretend otherwise. In fact, they are the archetypical versions of their stereotypes! This exaggeration, however, merely serves to further the film's ultimate message and purpose! Didn't Dickens employ the use of archetypical character portraits for most of his serials, as well? Didn't this, too, help broaden the scope of his views, and lend to thousands of English readers an idea of the poverty of the working class? Well, the same exact goes for American Beauty, which paints the American middle-class lifestyle for what it is: a materialistic enterprise and empty ideal, replacing for its followers a longed-for sense of happiness with petty materialism and hopeless monetary fulfillment. THe film's characters are the idea, the American dream of hope and life which eventually, inevitably, surrenders itself to stasis and inertia. That's why the characters are so stereotypical! THey *are* the dream! In fact, they are an extended version of the dream. Anette Bening's character sells the dream itself, in the form of suburban real estate, and in her failure(which suggests to her the unthinkable notion that what she does for a living provides only emptiness) aspires to be an even higher, more unattainable ideal: the real-estate ""king"" who represents to her a synthetic notion of perfection and contentment, succcess. In fact, the man is an a**hole himself! As for the teenagers: yes, this is what middle-class teenagers are like! Believe me, I know. I am 17 years old. The contrived ""beauty"" of the floating bag does not lend any insight to the next-door neighbor, but rather attests to the pretense of these ordinary things being considered beautiful. Lester's obsession with the ordinary, everyday luxuries, the marijuana, the finetuning of his physical being, the reattachment to some idea to which he attributes ""happiness,"" also seems empty and unfulfilling, ultimately leading to death(which is why the perpetrator is more or less tagged on as an afterthought: it doesn't matter!). This is the danger of creating the idea and fixing your reality to inertly reflect it. It is not real! Happiness is a completely internal phenomenon, achievable only by some direct realization of the self, not some contrived ""idea"" of the self as presented in such novels as ""The Great Gatsby."" This is the message of the film! Thank you. Have a nice day!"

","This movie portrays the true nature of how money can overrun families while simultaneously painting the very real picture of suburban life.  At times, one can find connections with F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby.  The ending follows the end of Fitzgerald's novel, which may lead to a message the director was trying to get at through this piece of cinematic genius;money does not buy happiness. <br/><br/>The movie itself is able to capture the feeling of growing tension in the house.  The use of the neighbor as an unopinionated observer, again a connection with The Great Gatsby, adds to the story because he provides a view from outside of the family looking in.  This is craftily done and provides a unique and necessary point of view in order to give the story more depth.<br/><br/>All of this said, this movie is indeed a well crafted piece of cinema that we, the audience, rarily has the opportunity of seeing in this age of popular novel rip-offs."

","Although this film was the award winner and the masterwork of the year, I found it to be too much to digest at one time.  This film is an obvious attempt at fitting every controversial subject into one two hour movie. It includes adultry, homosexuality, drug use, child abuse and child pornography.  Some would claim that this is the most pure and honest way to make a movie, but American Beauty defeats itself by stringing together one eye-opener after another instead of focusing on one or two issues, thus killing the effect. So instead of this being an enjoyable movie with a real plot, it falls more into the category of the hordes of daytime talk shows and professional wrestling.  Not to say that I wasn't in the least entertained, It was wonderfully acted by all involved and it made for some of the most believeable characters in recent films. And of course we all have our guilty pleasures of listening to gossip and being interested in the ""who did what with who"".  But as far as making a film out of it, count me out. I could just phone a relative and get as much dirt as is in this movie."

","When I was returning home from the movie theatre, I couldn't help but think about what I had just seen. What was really good about it was the stillness of it all.  The mood of the whole thing was pleasent, it was so easy to watch.  The first half was a comedy, and I found myself laughing my head off, especially at the childishness that I saw in Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey).  The second half for me, began when the two teens watch the most beautiful thing Ricky (Wes Bentley) had ever filmed.  The comedy was still there, but it was shadowed by just how moving it all was.  The characters on the screen were people I found myself caring for, and I wanted to know what would happen to them. The final 15 minutes were hypnotic.  I don't think I blinked during that time, and even when the credits rolled, I was sitting in my seat still not blinking. For me (as you can probably tell), watching this movie was an absolute pleasure.  And as a person who doesn't feel that movies influences social behaviour, this movie did influence me."
"chrisbrown6453","8","0","0","6 July 2001"," A wonderful depiction of midlife crisis.
","American Beauty, directed by British theater director Sam Mendes (Cabaret, The Blue Room) and written by Alan Ball, is a film which focuses on a suburban-American family, portraying its characters' dysfunctional relationships as a direct symptom of their unorthodox conceptions of what beauty is. As its title implies, the film begs the question ""What is American beauty?"" and without providing a concrete answer, it explores the endemic problems haunting many contemporary families: consumerism, unemployment, drugs, peer pressure, loneliness, discrimination and violence. American Beauty opens by having its protagonist, Lester Burnham (a convincing Kevin Spacey at his best) declare: ""I'm 42 years old. In less than a year, I'll be dead. Of course, I don't know that yet. In a way, I'm dead already"". In this simple manner the film establishes its somber tone, its dry sense of humor, its non-linear narration, and its character's fate. Having revealed the fatal outcome, what follows is a brief view of the final days of Lester's frustrated life; of his wife Carolyn's, amazingly enough played by Annette Bening, systematic belittling of him and all things associated with him; and of their daughter's (Thora Birch) overpowering contempt towards both of them. Coupling and/or contrasting these characters' conflicts with those of their repressed neighbors (Ricky Fitts and his ex-Marine dad, played by Wes Bentley and Chris Cooper) and their sexually uninhibited peers (Angela and Buddy King, played by Mena Suvari and Peter Gallagher), American Beauty discovers those harsh elements that lead to infatuation, adultery, murder, and --lastly-- self-reflection."

The thing that I did not like and or agree with in this movie is the fact that Lester didn't get along with his wife or daughter but he fell in love with his daughters school friend. That is simply unnormal. You will see a lot of strange parts in this movie including the parts when Ricky (neighbor) stalks Lesters daughter. At the end of the movie Lester is shot in the head by Rickys father because he thinks that Ricky is having an affair with Lester (that is another sick thing about the movie in my opinion).

","American Beauty was an interesting foot note in the explosion of avant garde films of 1999.  But I have a severe problem putting it close to the top of that year.  Most people feel that one of the more overlooked films of that particular year was Fight Club which deals with some of the same ideas only on a much broader and more anarchistic way.<br/><br/>American Beauty should be looked at as an American tragedy much like A Raisin in the Sun. But just because it's ""like"" A Raisin in the Sun doesn't mean it's also great.  <br/><br/>The film contains some great acting from Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, and the entire cast but the story is overly cliche at times and lacks the reality that it sets itself up to be.  If all of this is supposed to be taking place in a real world, as Mendes sets up, there are several substantial problems.  It seems in his world POT has no smell and successful drug dealers are not the brightest bulbs in the house.<br/><br/>To many times this film tries to be a character study and is unable to because of the unbelievability of the characters. Again, this is not a problem with the acting but rather the film making.<br/><br/>I suppose I was more impressed with The Sixth Sense and Fight Club as potential motion pictures of the year.<br/><br/>Again, not bad, but not great either."

It saves us all a lot of time--when Yosemite Sam walks into the saloon, you don't have to spend five minutes of dialogue to establish his motivation. He's Yosemite Sam. If you thought this flick was obvious, unrealistic, and pedantic, you're right.  On the other hand, they didn't make this movie for you.

","I suppose one laudable aspect of this movie is that most of my comments are content-related, not stylistic.  Stylistically, this is an unimpeachable movie.<br/><br/>One thing that somewhat worries me is the way Lester's anger is managed in the movie.  Of course, there is absolutely nothing which insists we see Lester's snippy, antagonistic attitude as part of his heroicism.  But I'm concerned that the movie sells his failure to find a path that might include his wife (producing reconciliation) as part of his heroic charm.  That his wife is so powerfully painted as emotionally self-checking, hence unapproachable, only suggests to me that she might be a bit too much of a straw dog.  It would be a very rare, real, live person who would be such a cartoon caricature of lost-in-the-id middle-class power-mongering, don't you think?  I think that, as people finely find their way out of the muck that can be their lives, they figure out how to bring their loved ones along with them.  My own way of digesting this anger content is to see an intent to make Lester very human, therefore fully fallible.  It's just that one usually sees this kind of behavior being lauded as a strong point of the hero (stark, confrontational, direct, ""honest"", etc., etc.).  I'm not sure the direction willingly gives the viewer the option to see otherwise.  I know it's just a movie, and I can see it's a borderline farce, with somewhat farcical characterizations.  But it winds up wishing to comment on the big goal, the boodle, the dharma, the ball o' wax; and I'm not sure the movie succeeds in this, given what appears to be a lack of investment in emotional requisites, at least with respect to Lester.<br/><br/>What else?  Lots of very glorious moments.  Someone else mentioned the daughter's posing semi-nude in the window for her video-wielding boyfriend; I'll chime in on that one.  Even though it sounds perverse and cheezy in reading, the film very effectively sets up that scene, so it works as a sweetly vulnerable and moving moment.  The garage scene at the end with the Marine father--giving in momentarily to his primal need--just might be the most incredible piece of acting I've ever seen in my life.<br/><br/>In the end, I'll say that I liked the film, and didn't feel I wasted my time watching it, and I might recommend it to certain people, under certain circumstances.  But I don't think it'll stand the test of time.  And I certainly hope I'm wrong, since the creative people involved took a stab at delivering the Big Message, and one would like to think they hit their target.  I hope it hits in a meaningful and even useful way for many.<br/><br/>P.S.:  The pop music (not mood music) bits sometimes didn't work for me. For example, when the Lolita goes downstairs to console herself listening to the stereo, the filmmakers would have us believe she'd put on some contemporary singer/songwriting singing Neil Young's ""Don't let it bring you down"".  I mean, like, give me a break...."

","The writers, producers, directors of this effort would have you believe that this is some sort of artsy, deep, deep portrayal of ""middle Americans'"" their values, their hypocrisy and the empty lives they all lead.<br/><br/>The film fairly hammers the audience with this message so that even the dimmest can get the point. The real estate wife, fairly whimpering with frustrated greed when she can't sell a house and who sleeps with the boss because she admires his salesmanship.(Is this REALLY believable?) Her husband (Spacey) who, while not only an unadmirable character,(he's a blackmailer), seems to be able to quickly strike up a close relationship with the completely alienated son of his next door neighbour but can't seem to do the same thing with his own equally alienated daughter.(Why is she alienated? We're never told.) The homophobic neighbour who just happens to be a latent homosexual and (surprise, surprise) a military man to boot! Good grief, the film is wall to wall cliched characters all of whom are overdrawn and frankly, not believable in either their dialogue or their actions. However, where the film really fails is that by the end of it and looking back, I can't recall one character that I ever truly cared what happened to or felt some sympathy for. Like the Spacey character himself, I felt cut off from the events before me and seemed to be watching it all through uncaring eyes. Maybe that was how one was supposed to feel and that was the ""genius"" of the film. But somehow I doubt it, since one can experience the same emotion watching ""Freddie Got Fingered"" - and that ain't no work of genius."
"Jeremy Bristol","8","0","0","30 May 2001"," Great movie, but I'm not sure it's timeless.
","As much as I love this movie (8/10), I have this nagging feeling that twenty or thirty years from now our grandchildren and movie historians will laugh at us for buying into it.  There's way too much of a baby-boomer/overgrown hippie mentallity.  For god's sake, The Grateful Dead had an album with the same title (and I have a sneaking suspicion that Mendes and Ball are playing off that by making Lester grateful that he's dead).<br/><br/>Spoilers: The biggest problem with the movie is that most of the character shifts are way too formulaic and predictable to warrant the tagline, ""Look closer."" Basically, whatever the character denies the most is what he or she really is.  Annette Bening tries to put on a strong facade because she is really weak.  The boy's father hates gays because he is gay (anybody else think that is insulting?--admittedly, though, our society does make it extremely stressful to be gay, but there's hardly any lead up to it, and I disagree wholeheartedly with the DVD commentary by the filmmakers in which they said they needed to keep it a surprise by excising or trimming sequences that hinted at it).  And of course, Mena Suvari's character is a virgin because she keeps talking about all the men she's slept with (funny, but even though she's a liar, I still believe the part about men staring at her as a young child).<br/><br/>Lester, on the other hand, doesn't change at the end of the movie--he changes at the beginning. In fact, the majority of the movie is a very interesting, near-brilliant look at the consequences of this change--a man trying to be a teenager again.  By the end of the movie, when he returns to being a father (as the moviemakers point out) when he's lying on top of Suvari, we understand a lot about mortality and the pains of growing older (and it's a lot more than no longer being able to have the pretty young girls).  In fact, by the end, Lester had become so earnest and honest that I couldn't imagine him saying what he says in the voice over without him actually meaning it--despite the fact that it is obviously satiric (""You will someday""--right, after you're dead like him. That's too late, hence the satire).<br/><br/>The other interesting story surrounds Lester's daughter, who seems to be repulsed by the neighbor boy.  Of course, she ends up being in love with him because he in turn is not the creepy pervert he sets himself up to seem. However, they (as a kind of coming-of-age subplot that parallels and counterpoints Lester's main story of the ending of life) change in numerous other ways, like real people. Despite the viciousness of the violence surrounding it, my favorite scene in the whole movie is when she lets him watch her undress--a very tender and beautiful/sad scene, one of the best pseudo-sexual awakenings on film.<br/><br/>Spoiler: By the way, didn't anybody catch that the American Beauty rose that permeates the movie (especially Lester's daydreams of Suvari's character) is representative of Annette Bening's character?  Which would mean that Suvari's character also represents Bening's character (the young one that mooned police helicopters).  I haven't decided yet whether that's brilliant or formulaic."

","american beauty is my favorite movie of all time.  i basically registered on this site so i could add this comment and address some of the negative stuff people to throw at this film.  Its so hard to explain why i love this film. so many times a person can walk away from a movie and take much more out of it than others, and it often comes down to personal taste.  This however is a unique case.  I dare say that i believe the people who didn't like this movie, at least most of them, simply didn't get it.  Or didn't get all of it.  If someone actually walked away feeling the message of the movie, its hard to disagree or not like it becuase the message is how we should not take anything in life for granted, and that theres is beauty in even some of the worst parts of life; the key word there being life.  Life is an amazing, mysterious, crazy and difficult thing, but something that usually, if we don't enjoy, its our fault.  So much of it is state of mind, the same thing can happen to two different peoeple but they can each be effected differently becuase of their outlook on life.  This movie tried to suggest maybe we should change the way we look at things.  Maybe we should realize that, in the end, and no matter how far away it seems the end ALWAYS eventually will come, so much of the crap we let get in the way just doesn't matter.  We don't need to arrive at the end to finally learn this lesson. Enjoy life as you live it, look at the big picture and see life as a good thing, even though individual cases may not at first seem that way.  I watch movies to enjoy them, not to find the meaning to the universe. After american beauty, however, i actually took something with me after the credits rolled.  It helped me realize that life isn't always beautiful in the sense of happy-go-lucky disney type cheerfulness.  It is often stressful, unfair, sad, (and for those of you out there who write that they've never encountered such dysfunctional families in real life...consider yourself the lucky minority, or maybe you just haven't looked around hard enough) but beauty doesn't always have to be so obvious. Look for it, and its there, because life itself is the most beautiful thing. Well...after reading this over i realize i may sound like a wierdo to anyone who doesn't agree with or follow what i'm trying to say, but the bottom line is american beauty has a very important message.  If you don't feel that way, watch it again.  It may be a bit more cinematic than real life, but it gets the point across."

The performances from the younger actors,Thora Birch,Wes Bentley,and Mena Suvari are just as good as the performances from Kevin and Annette. Thora Birch plays Jane,the teenager with a low self-esteem, mostly thanks to Angela ,who every day she has to deal with her bragging.But just when she thinks that nobody can understand her she meets Ricky. Judging from her performance you can tell that we'll be seeing her around more often. Wes Bentley as Ricky is to me a hard part to play. He films everything he sees and buys all of his equipment from selling drugs.He falls in love with Jane and eventually get to know each other.Bentley is someone you don't see every day.Ricky to me is a mature character and Bentley is one of those young actors who will spend his life working with legendary actors and matching up to their performance. Mena Suvari is a talented young actress who is remembered as playing Angela Hayes,the seductive teen and when she sees that Lester likes her,makes him a target. And as we can see in Lester's dreams that she really seduces him In conclusion, there are a lot of movies in my opinion that win Best Picture at the Oscars and are not worthy of it. It just got picked because of it's gross.For example, Gladiator won Best Picture this year and I loved the movie but hearing from reviews many think Traffic was more worthy of it. American Beauty is one of few films that certainly deserved the Oscar."

","Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>The term Â‘comedy drama' does this film no justice. It merely confines an unsettlingly beautiful film with the restrictions of an insipid label that it so clearly surpasses. The superlative level on which all this films operates is unchartered territory- never before has a film come so close to being an actual work of art. American Beauty contains a disturbing composition of escapisms never before explored in modern cinema.<br/><br/>American Beauty delves us into the banal world of Lester Burnham, (Spacey, in serious Oscar form), a bored 42 year old writer who's highlight of the day is `whacking off' during his morning shower. He has lost all affection for his vain, realty agent wife, Caroline (Bening), his bitter teenage daughter Jane (one very mature Birch) reviles him, (`I wish someone would just put him out of his misery') and he antagonises with them both on a daily basis. Worst of all, he feels tired, alienated and ordinary living in the dull realms of upper middle class suburbia.<br/><br/>This flat world of resentment and hypocrisy comes to a startling halt when Jane's beautiful best friend Angela (American Pie's Suvari) enters his life. Along with her comes a glorious fantasy world in which Lester becomes lost, yet oddly liberated. He quits that boring job, he begins to smoke pot, he starts working out. He does what he feels again.<br/><br/>Peppered throughout what is essentially Lester's mid-life crisis, are a menagerie of erratic and unstable characters who each have their many complexlayers peeled back petal by petal as the film progresses.<br/><br/>In Caroline, Annette Bening plays out the insecure and temperamental icon that is the modern woman with such magnitude and vigor, that each movement, each expression she makes is brimming with a multitude of complexities.<br/><br/>Birch composes a creature of diverse radiance and intellect in Janie, a true beauty in the sense of the word, trapped in an oppressive, unsuppourtive environment. Suvari as the object of Lester's affections produces an enigmatic creature in Angela, extensively ranging from confident to vulnerable, fibreless to fragile-her character surprises you.<br/><br/>Bentley proves himself a breakthrough force to be reckoned with as Ricky Fittz, the Burnham's voyeuristic neighbour, drug dealer and sometimes waiter who steals young Janie's heart. His poignancy and vulnerability invoke both pity and hope as he pursues something more pure and beautiful than any of the other flawed characters are capable of.<br/><br/>The most disturbing and powerful performances though come from Chris Cooper and Allison Janney in the relatively minor roles of Ricky's parents, Colonel and Barbara Fitts. Both portray their fragmentary and removed characters with such a masterful helplessness, that they resonate an eerie presence on one's memory that remains long you have left the theatre.<br/><br/>In his first venture into celluloid, theatre director Mendes has captured all the beauty and culture of the stage and transcended it onto the screen. He skillfully extracts each wrenching emotion and each sarcastic moment from both his cast and Alan Ball's poignant screenplay. This, combined with Thomas Newman's unsettling score and all the other brilliant aspects of this film creates a uniformed creative relationship that allows them to play out the breath taking realms of fantasy as well as the harsh actualities of reality on the screen.<br/><br/>Despite the anger, the banality, the bitterness and basic ugliness of everydayness that plays out on screen, American Beauty is a beautiful and lucid film with an oddly calming effect. It is a one of a kind. Disturbing yet beautiful. Haunting yet hilarious. Touching yet distant.<br/><br/>Go and see this film, you've never seen anything else like it."

American Beauty gave me a personal level of understanding. I identify with this film because i often feel very much rejected in society and am shunned by others for being different.

","One of the main faults I found with this film (and I will admit I looked for them because of the hype) is that many people said it reflected real-life, yet it's atmosphere was too surreal to allow the viewer to feel any relation to the film.  Likewise the characters and their situations were all too far to the extremes in their makeup to reflect the much more complicated lives we lead.<br/><br/>In a more entertainment driven sense, however, the performances were very good and the script was well-written, funny and full of the right amount of emotion.  The story was immersive and includes a few instances that genuinely leave you guessing until the last minute.<br/><br/>It's not quite as deep as the hype made it sound, the overall message seems fairly simple, that we should understand what we want better and try to avoid the repressive things in society or they will bring us down, basically to relax more.  If the lives in America's suburban neighbourhoods are more like this overall then I think they do have serious problems. Looking at my own life and those of people around me, even we of the working class suburbs who work most of the time lead much more varied and colourful lives than here.<br/><br/>There is a tendency today to overemphasize the number of problems in family life, something perpetuated by the perception of problems in family life and looking too deeply into minor things that were ignored in the past because people didn't have the time to notice them and just got on.  There is no denying that there are more divorces and single-parents e.t.c. but is this necessarily a bad thing, might it just be a step forward into creating less rigid relationships that allow us to be happier, I think these are just freedoms that weren't expressed before because society didn't allow them but that the number of genuinely happy families is the same, if not higher than that of previous generations.<br/><br/>Or am I just too much of an optimist in that sense."

","Dear Lester Burnam:  <br/><br/>I was sorry to hear of your death, mainly because I was very curious to see how your experiment would have ended.  You blackmailed your employer for a year's salary.  Had you not suddenly died, what were you planning to do?  Maybe someone will one day write a 'sequel' to your story, one set in a parallel universe where you didn't die, and after the money ran out, you had to decide what to do next.  <br/><br/>It's not surprising you've come to the conclusion that old=bad, teen=good. All the grown ups around you are fools.  All the teens are wise and kind.  The only real problems the kids have are their loser parents.  <br/><br/>Lester, the critics talked about how you chose to purge your life of what is 'bad' and get in touch with what really mattered. They were wrong.  You criticize your wife for loving a couch, but a moment earlier, you told her you 'ruled' because you bought a classic car.  <br/><br/>I couldn't help but notice that what was 'bad' was invariably grown up, while what was 'good' was invariably youthful. You drift away from your wife and focus on a teenage girl.  You give up your mature, responsible job to work at a fast food place.  You buy the car you wanted to have as a kid.  Lester, the critics have it all wrong.  You're not 'improving' your life, you're infantalizing it.  You're turning your back on grown up life and trying to act like a kid.  <br/><br/>Lester, you are not alone in your youth obsession.  Years ago, teenagers went to movies and watched with fascination as grown ups like Cary Grant and Grace Kelly fell in love.  Today, people in their forties watch 'Dawson's Creek' and 'Titanic.'    It's a new world, one where being a kid is cool and sexy, and being old (my God, forties!) means being dead.  <br/><br/>Personally, I'm having none of it.  I was miserable as a teenager and I'm looking forward to the rewards of maturity.   Rent 'Welcome To The Dollhouse' or 'Lord Of The Flies,' and I guarantee they will cure you of your teenage fascination.  Grown up life has a lot of pluses.  Raising a daughter is one.  A marriage where the years spent together have created a unique bond that no one night stand can come close to is another. <br/><br/>
Your failure to make your grown up life work, and your desire to regress to teenhood is not something to feel proud of, Lester.  You can't turn yourself into a teen, no matter how hard you try. And even if you could, you shouldn't.  The solution to your problems would have been to fix your life.  Don't like your job?  Quit and find a better one, and not at a fast food place.  Don't like your marriage?  Don't obsess over teen girls. Get some counseling.  And pay attention to that teenage daughter of yours.  Grow up, Lester.  It's not so bad. I"

"b-a-h TNT-6","6","0","0","20 April 2001"," Pretty good but deeply flawed
","American Beauty tries really hard to be a intense commentary on modern society in the so-called ""civilized world"". The portrait of a disillusioned middle-aged man given by Kevin Spacey is superb and deserved the praise it got. Although his character shows obvious psychological and moral flaws, one could only sympathize for his decision to choose sincerity as a cure to his disillusioned life. Spacey's character, the flawed man that conveys more humanity than anybody else, is nothing new to the cinema industry: think about One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (which is, anyway, a far superior film) for instance. But while not revolutionary, American Beauty is very well crafted around Spacey, and the rest of the actors give out fairly good performance. On the psychological level, this is a film about comprehension and respect, and a beautiful one.<br/><br/>However, on the social level, this film fails miserably. And that's where ""beauty"" comes in.<br/><br/>Such lines as ""there's so much beauty in the world"" and the infamous plastic bag scene are absurd and irritating. There's nothing beautiful in a piece of trash that pollutes our environment, there's not that much beauty in the world anymore considering that we keep destroying it, considering that numerous species of animals seem doomed to extinction, and especially considering that none of the characters in the movie seems to care about it AT ALL. The plastic bag scene would have worked with a bird... or even with a rat, if one wants to find beauty in what most people can't... but with a plastic bag it's just fluffy and hypocritical. Fight Club - another movie that explored the ground of psychological disillusion and flaws in our society - got into a lot controversy about its violence when, in fact, was delivering a much more carefully constructed message about respect for nature and what our society has to avoid.<br/><br/>In other words, this movie works in a beautiful way around the human characters, but all it pulls out is a ""enjoy your life"" message that ultimately seems, if not in contrast with what the movie was saying in the beginning, very mild and inappropriate anyway.<br/><br/>That's why I think this movie is interesting, but not a masterpiece at all. Not even close.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Go see American Beauty.  All of you.  Just try to make sure to see it by yourself, in an empty theater.<br/><br/>OK, so you can't do that.  But I'm convinced that doing so is the ideal way to get into the feel of this movie.  It's a film with a lot of atmosphere, mostly of loneliness and quiet desperation (Thomas Newman's sparse, dissonant score is a great touch).  In addition, there will be times which make you want to gasp when others are laughing, and times when you want to laugh while others are gasping.  It's just that kind of movie -- a must-see for introverts with a penchant for navel-gazing.  <br/><br/>Lester, Carolyn, and daughter Jane are the Burnhams, your standard American dysfunctional family.  One can tick off the basic indicators on one's fingers -- hen-pecked Dad hates his stultifying position as a low-level executive, control-freak Mom is obsessed with her real estate job, low-self-image teenager hates her parents, everyone is distant.  The family has managed to establish a stable but tenuous equilibrium in their interactions, straining to maintain a facade of normality in their lives. <br/><br/>
When the Burnhams are introduced to some people (the Fitts family, Jane's friend Angela, rival real estate agent Buddy Kane), however, the facade quickly comes crashing down, with some astonishing consequences.  Lester gets reintroduced to pot, quits his job, and becomes infatuated with Angela; Carolyn begins an affair; Jane realizes that Ricky Fitts is videotaping her (he defends himself by saying he's ""not obsessing ... just curious""). <br/><br/>
It's not so much about what happens, though, as about how it happens. American Beauty outright tells us at the beginning what happens at the end, and yet the finale still manages to come as a shock.  The interweaving lines of the plot are familiar territory (Lester's Lolita complex, Jane's insecurity, Ricky's rebellion against his disciplinarian father), but they only serve to guide the audience through the characters' transformations. These transformations are ultimately what drive the film, providing moments of comedy, sadness, and even horror.  It's up to the individual viewer to decide which moments are which; some are all three.  <br/><br/>The characters are intentionally drawn as two-dimensional and slightly caricaturish, but stellar performances make them tangible and deeply sympathetic.  Special mentions have to go to Wes Bentley, whose Ricky Fitts provides the film with the closest thing to a moral center, and Kevin Spacey, who turns in a workmanlike performance as Lester which should be solid enough to garner an Oscar nomination (but probably won't be spectacular enough to win).  In fact, the only quibble in this department would be with Annette Bening, whose portrayal of Carolyn is slightly more over-the-top than the rest of the cast.  <br/><br/>Gorgeously shot by cinematographer Conrad Hall and first-time director Sam Mendes, and overripe with metaphor, American Beauty will attack each individual audience member's center of gravity and challenge their assumptions.  It is profoundly disturbing, but it is also achingly tender, and ultimately contains glimmers of hope and tender soulfulness.  In the face of so much pain and dissonance, it remains hauntingly beautiful; as Ricky says, ""Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world, I feel like I can't take it.""  It's the perfect summary for this extraordinary film.<br/><br/>Look closer..."

","Souls are bared and individual vulnerability is exposed in this film in which the dysfunctional family becomes the norm, and a man at last confronts the fact that his life is simply not as it should be, and determines to do something about it.  `American Beauty,' directed by Sam Mendes and starring Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, rips the facade from a typical American family to reveal a not-so-typical family after all.  Or are they?  For who among us, living in this finely woven tapestry that is modern American life, can really define `typical?'  Or for that matter, `normal?'  In what is to be the final year of his life (though he doesn't know it), Lester Burnham (Spacey) finally acknowledges to himself that he is in a loveless marriage, has a dead end job, and has for some time (too long) been a mere observer, rather than a participant, in his own life.  His wife, Carolyn (Bening), a fledgling real estate broker, disdains him, and his teenaged daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), accords him nothing but disrespect.  He has a new neighbor, Colonel Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper), a U.S. Marine who is the virtual embodiment of the `Corps,' with a wife, Barbara (Allison Janney), he has disciplined into a trance-like state of existence, and a teenaged son, Ricky (Wes Bentley), who sees beauty in the least likely of places.<br/><br/>	It's a stylized, thought provoking film in which Mendes lowers the mask and raises a mirror to reflect the true nature of a society too often willing to cast the first stone while refusing to first seek out the detritus in it's own eye.  Devoid of stereotypes, the characters herein represent a realistic and concise cross-section of individuals who form, not only the periphery, but the core of that very same society.  And though personal experience and frame of reference will go far in determining how accepting a viewer may be of this picture of urban misalignment Mendes presents, there is no denying the reality of the attitudes and situations represented here.  To deny this depiction as accurate would merely be a turning away from the truth.<br/><br/>	Once again demonstrating that he is one of the finest actors around, Kevin Spacey deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Lester. It's a finely tuned expression of a middle-aged man, not just in crisis, but lost in soul wrenching turmoil.  Many may find it difficult to sympathize to any great extent with Spacey's Lester, but regardless, they (as well as those who are able to sympathize with him) will at least be able to identify with him.  For in Lester we find all of the variances and complexities that make up this journey we call life.  And Spacey captures it all, from Lester's apathy and ambiguity, to the emotional peaks and valleys of his epiphany, with a truly memorable performance.<br/><br/>	Annette Bening, also, turns in one of her best performances, for which she was nominated for Best Actress.  She shines as Carolyn, a woman repressed and frustrated who hides her discontent with hyperactivity and denial, and puts on a mask of pretentiousness that is so animated at times that it's nerve-wracking to watch.  But it's a great piece of acting, through which she certainly brings her character to life.<br/><br/>	Giving a performance that demands mention, as well, is Wes Bentley, who achieves an introspective depth with his character that establishes what a tremendous ability he has as an actor.  This is one young man from whom we can expect great things in the future.<br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes Peter Gallagher (Buddy Kane), Mena Suvari (Angela), Scott Bakula (Jim), Sam Robards (`JB'), Barry Del Sherman (Brad) and Erin Cathryn Strubbe (Young Jane).  A cutting-edge character study, `American Beauty' is a probing and revealing contemporary fable that is uncompromisingly honest; probably too honest for some.  It's a film that refuses to allow the viewer to take an `ignorance is bliss' stance, and instead insists on a truth that lays waste to hypocrisy and self-righteousness.  For when you're forced to stare into a mirror, there is only one image you're going to see staring back; and whether or not you like what you see is going to be entirely up to you.  And therein lies the real impact of this film.  I rate this one 10/10."

","Definitely the best movie I have ever seen dealing with the intense emotions and acute depression ordinary families endure.  The comedy offers relief from what could otherwise be an emotionally torturous two hours of watching the players careen towards inevitable breakdown.  Fortunately you leave the theater satisfied yet shocked at how much you sometimes feel like the characters."

","Among many critics of American Beauty` I found exactly one negative. Almost everybody likes this film and, although I have to agree with the author of that bad critic in a few points, it is really almost perfect. I would not say the story is new, it's just the old American-Dream-loser-story presented again in a quite exaggerated way, but who cares? The topic will be interesting as long as the American Dream exists and if there is a good film about it, it's this one. Kevin Spacey was the logical cast for the male lead, but Annette Bening gives a surprisingly superb performance as his wife. Also the young actors do a good job. The best stories are those you can't summarize in a few sentences. I don't think it's necessary to go too much into detail, I just wanted to add one more absolutely positive comment. If you haven't seen American Beauty` yet, go and watch it."
"agfletcher","Null","0","0","4 April 2001"," American Beauty: A classic ? Or just another great film ?
","On the screen, when actors become real people, when lines become real voices, when a plot becomes a compelling, often humorous real-life drama, and the whole chronicles something about ourselves and our times, then we may have to at least consider that this might be  ""A Classic.""<br/><br/>American Beauty is a rich film which works in almost every department; the plot with its whodunnit/whydunnit tension, the acting performances; the photography and music enhancing some scenes as backdrops, prominently at the forefront and exhilerating in others; the wholly original and theatrically influenced direction and faultless production values. They all combine here to produce a great film.<br/><br/>Films earn the label ""Classic"" through time. Time is as much a judge as are film critics or straight forward contemporary popularity. It's a little premature to rank American Beauty up there with Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Twelve Angry Men, Cuckoo's Nest, The Godfather, Schindler's List et al because Old Father T. hasn't yet mused on the issue long enough. It's quite possible that in 5 years' time, we'll be wondering what all the fuss was about. However, I'd wager that if OFT had to choose one film made in the last 5 years which might be in the frame for Eternal Citation, American Beauty would be it."

","I don't think this movie rates quite the high vote it gets. Firstly being an avid watcher of European film and so-called 'art' movies, the concepts in this film are not all that new. The general ideas and feelings expressed in this movie make it good to watch and quite enjoyable. Kevin Spacey acts very well here.The ending is quite good too. But that is just it. Everything is 'just good'. There is nothing particularly new here. The movie has all the required bits like humourous moments and sad moments and somber moments and tense moments and... you get the idea. I think most credit for this film should go to the director and editor which put everything together very well indeed. All in all an enjoyable experience but not memorable."

"chndnnyk","10","0","0","25 March 2001"," puts our definitions of Normalcy and Beauty under scrutiny
","This movie blew me away. It puts society's definitions of Normalcy and Beauty under heavy scrutiny. What appears ordinary is often captivating; what appears unique is often forlorn; what appears powerful is often empty; what appears strong is often weak; what appears strange is often beautiful.<br/><br/>Every character in this film is brilliantly chosen and interrelated thematically. There's a high-school girl who is insecure about being ordinary. Another high-schooler who has ""made"" herself unique by molding her persona and ambition around what others have deemed desirable. A working mom who desires social ambitions so much that she is losing sight of her life. A domineering father who has long-since lost sight his life and who has taken social mores and discipline to the extreme. A reticent mother whose life is dead and who is trapped in perpetual depression.<br/><br/>But, wait - there is hope. He is a teenage boy who lives next door. A strange kid who is both spontaneous and genuine - without social ambition, without social inhibition. He finds beauty in the purest form(like a dead bird or a floating plastic bag). He inspires both his girlfriend and her father to change their lives. Most notably, this happens with Kevin Spacey - the underappreciated husband, hated father, and corporate kick-boy who, inspired by his unique neighbor, recaptures his life by liberating himself from his suburban shackles."

"Howlin Wolf","9","0","0","17 March 2001"," Superbly crafted.
","The puzzling thing about this film for me is that no single scene will make you think ""That was great"".  Instead, after a few moments reflection when the credits roll, you'll probably find yourself thinking, as I did, that you've just seen a great film.<br/><br/>   (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)<br/><br/>   IMO, the film deserved its Oscars.  I don't think the film offers us ANYTHING we haven't seen before, to a greater or lesser degree, but I think that is the film's strength.  In the characters and the way they act we see so much of ourselves, our frustrations made public and our inner desires laid bare.  We've seen all of this before in good movies and the people we know intimately because it relates to US, in the way only the best movies and the most honest people can.  Where I feel it differs from other movies that explore similar themes (I know they're out there, I just can't think of a particular example at the moment!) is this:<br/><br/>  In satire it is all too easy to take a broad swipe at the obvious targets. The disenchanted middle-aged, for example (man or woman), without really digging under the surface and exposing what might perhaps make us a little uncomfortable.  So you get the middle aged man, but you don't get him attempting to act on his desire for his teenaged daughter's best friend;  OH NO! that would be too controversial and be sending out the wrong message! What the makers of ""American Beauty"" seem to understand is that a toothless satire just doesn't work, you need to have the courage to take your exposure to the very limits, or you shouldn't bother trying at all.  ""American Beauty"", thankfully, doesn't pull its punches when showing the audience what life is REALLY like.  The tone is also consistent throughout, which means it doesn't fall flat on its face by turning its characters into caricatures half way through.<br/><br/>   This is down, in some way, to the script, but also to the beautifully judged performances delivered by all the cast.  I think it would be deeply unfair to single out any one individual for special praise.  Suffice to say that Kevin Spacey is a superb actor, as most would agree, and not even the less experienced members of the cast (Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari) look out of place acting opposite him.<br/><br/>   One thing I don't understand though:  WHAT is so profound about a plastic bag blowing in the wind?  I look hard, and I don't see a symbol of life's beauty/fragility, I just see litter!  Greenpeace must be fuming about this...  In all seriousness, though, it strikes me as one of the only false notes in the movie.  It really is quite trite, and seems to be at odds with the subtlety displayed in the rest of the film.  The characters themselves have done a perfectly good job of emphasising that sometimes we have to look closer to see real beauty, the point doesn't need to be laboured by such a blatant attempt at emotional manipulation.  After all, it IS JUST a plastic bag!<br/><br/>   Dubious attempt to use a device for transporting shopping as a hamfisted metaphor aside, this really IS a great film.  The 90's has had its fair share of classic cinema, this is definitely one such example."
"sisyphus-12","8","0","0","15 March 2001"," Entertaining...but Not Much More
","Perhaps I'm judging this movie a little unfairly--that is, against the hype and excessive accolades it received rather than against only its own successes and failures. It IS, after all, an entertaining, enjoyable film. But I would not call it a great film. Enough has been said about the great performances--yeah, they're great, but....<br/><br/>It is a message film about middle age, suburban American life, and base materialism. As a message film, though, it is very odd. Lester Burnham,<br/><br/>successful executive, burns out, blackmails his boss, quits his job, and develops the hots for his teenage daughter's best friend.<br/><br/>
His shrewish wife, meantime, starts a romp with a local hot shot real estate agent, who turns her on not only to adultery, but to shooting, too, offering the cliched explanation that it makes him feel powerful.<br/><br/>Lester's daughter starts hanging out with the weird, pot-dealing son of the fascistic Marine (yes, THAT old cliche) next door. The boy's father beats the tar out of him routinely, and with particular violence when he suspects his boy might be gay. Not soon after, during a painful scene of misunderstanding that results from the boy assuring his father that he and Lester have been having sex (not true; he said it to hurt his father), the father makes a pass at Lester. Yes, ANOTHER cliche: the Nazi-like homophobe (who actually collects Nazi war relics!) who is really gay himself!<br/><br/>
And what about the other messages? That the best way to deal with a difficult marriage, and life's disappointments is to quit your job, start smoking dope, and paw your daughter's friends? Seriously?<br/><br/>The only normal, well-adjusted people in this movie are Lester's gay neighbors (the other neighbors), whom we only briefly meet. I wonder...is this a message, too?"
"Skooru","Null","0","0","13 March 2001"," The Whole Is Greater Than The Sum Of Its Parts
","Being someone who is rarely impressed by Hollywood's output, American Beauty came as a complete surprise. But looking over these comments, I'm seeing a lot of arrogant and elitist claims that anyone who liked American Beauty is simply shallow, naive and inexperienced. I, and I'm sure many others, find this extremely offensive.<br/><br/>As my title says, ""the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."" To pick apart American Beauty is to ruin the entire effect of it. Yes, the characters are stereotypes in premise; yes, we've seen this story's outline done before. What we haven't seen, however, is an explanation of how these stereotypes came to be, and that not all ""good guys"" are illogically selfless. Deny that ""good"" people are imperfect, and keep living in that fantasy world. Deny that you haven't known a Lester Burnham, and deny that the sun sets in the east.<br/><br/>The film's so-called gratuity in sex and other ""offensive"" themes is blown entirely out of proportion. Maybe I've become too desensitized to real life, but if someone finds something as natural as ""masturbating"" disturbing, then this film is mocking you, not beneath your high-and-mighty moral standards. It's not attempting to shock or be profound, it's just being honest. It's not saying that everyone is like the Burnhams, it's just saying that there are people like this out there, much as society would like to paint otherwise. American Beauty shakes the foundations of propaganda and plasticity, bringing these ideas crashing down to reality. It's not trying to tell people how to live, but to never lose sight of what life is about. Surely I can't be alone when I say that I deny reality when it all becomes too much to handle? American Beauty is a film that tells you that if you face up to problems rather than gloss them over with sugar-coated ignorance, life will be a hell of a lot easier.<br/><br/>All in all, I found American Beauty to be an absolutely stunning work of art filled with equal portions of hilarity, poignance, and downright beauty. A rare work of brilliance; an all-time classic. Not to be missed, and I mean that both literally and figuratively."

","American Beauty was the first movie to win the Oscar deservedly quite possibly since Rain Man. Unfortunately, I suspect that the artistic aspects of the film were not all considered in the award. I will admit that the gorgeous cinematography got its proper recognition. However, the underlying theme is perhaps the most powerful aspect of the film, and perhaps the most overlooked.<br/><br/>The key to the movie lies in two things. First, there is the title: American Beauty. Second is the crucial scene with the plastic bag in front of the garage -- described as beautiful. The short monologue there, about how there is beauty in everything, coupled with the title leads us to begin to suspect a connection. And connection there is: the entire movie is about that kind of beauty in the seemingly ordinary. The daily lives of these people, their ups and their downs, blowing around their lives like the plastic bag in that film -- sometimes lifted up to almost beatific heights, touching the sky before they fall back down -- these are the things that make, in the mind of the filmmaker and in the mind of myself, America beautiful. It, like Fight Club is a very Zeitgeist type movie, capturing the spirit of the times in a few hours of film."

","Spacey gives his best performance yet; Bening does well (for once not being grating). Supporting cast is good. This film makes no claim to attempts at realism and is more akin to a weird, unimportant dream. A film that keeps you interested but has nothing that compels to watch again. This entire film feels as though one is being transported through an insomniatic skism- the super-dysfunctional mother (Bening) that most of saw growing up at a friend's house (but never our own). A Dad, basically an O.K. but uninterested (but interesting) guy in a doldrum-rut finding a spark to reignite his libido/life (daughter's g/f- played by Mena Suvari) and augmented by new neighbor kid/pot dealer played very intriquingly by Wes Bentley. The daughter seems to be, along with new boyfriend (Wes) one of the few with 2 feet planted firmly in reality. Well-known TV-quality actor Scott Bakula finally portrays the role he seemed destined for- the stereotypical gay (as portrayed in the non-PC days when ""gay"" roles entering mainstream film) other neighbor. Chris Cooper- the hugely underrated actor (he was the father in ""October Sky"") is too disturbing as a retired hardcore Marine Colonel and Wes' father. This is a melodrama played up for the moment due to a lack of current input of fakish Lawrence Kasden fare, but without the fake 'tude attached- the psycho-tropic flippantism still intact. See this movie, be entertained for a while then go see other films."

","When I first saw this movie I instantly fell in love with it.  It was after the Oscars (American Beauty won for Best Movie) so I figured...it must be good.  Even though I don't usually like movies that get so much hype.  I know I'm a little young to be in love with a movie like this but hey...what the heck?  The movie is basically about Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) going through kind of a mid-life crisis like stage in his life, to try to change it for the better so that it is more enjoyable.  Although I thought his relationship with Angela (Mina Suvari) was kind of disgusting...I'm glad that they didn't take it to a place that was down right tasteless. <br/><br/>
All of the actors in this movie were well casted.  Kevin Spacey played the title character...Lester Burnham..a 40 something year old man just looking for a little bit of realism and happiness in his seemingly perfect life. Annette Bening excellently portrayed Carolyn Burnham, A suburban wife trying to seem perfect to everyone on the outside.  In this desperate attempt to please people, she doesn't really please herself until she has a lusty affair with Buddy aka The ""Real-estate King.""  While doing this she completely ignores her husband and her daughter, Jane.  Jane is played by Thora Birch, who is IMO a wonderful actress.  This is a new kind of role for Thora, who is usually playing a little sweetheart.  But she does a wonderful job playing the confused, and bitterly unhappy Jane.  Someone that most teenagers can relate to.<br/><br/>Right next door live the Fitts family.  They, also putting on an act for everyone.  Well, all of them except for Ricky played so wonderfully by newcomer Wes Bentley.  Colonel Fitts is played by Chris Cooper.  He does a wonderful job playing a homophobic marine.  And Mrs. Fitts is played by Emmy winning Allison Janney.  Even though she barely speaks in the movie...she gives a beautiful performance.  And then there is Jane's best friend...Angela.  Angela is a beautiful blonde young woman who wants to always be unordinary is beautiful.  She is also the image of Lester Burnham's infatuation.<br/><br/>This movie had everything working for it.  From the marvelous actors, beautiful cinematography, and the original score by Thomas Newman. I also loved the symbolism of the red on white effect that you kept viewing during the movie. Even thought you don't agree with everything that Lester Burnham does on his quest to become happy and try to be kind of like a kid again...you have to admire him.  This movie takes you into the lives of a seemingly perfect suburban family.  My score...9 out of 10.  Definately worth seeing"

The entire cast devotes themselves to their roles and, while Annette Benning, Kevin Spacey, Chris Cooper and Allison Janney deliver superb performances, it's Wes Bentley who stands out with his speech about a flying bag.

","This is a (V.O.

I won't pretend to tell someone what they missed, or what to look for. I will only say that this film works on so many different levels that I believe each of us who have seen it come away with a feeling that is similar, but especially unique to each of us. I find it rare these days to find a film that is made with such intelligence and perhaps even more rare to find a movie that doesn't try so hard to make each of us feel or think a certain way.<br/><br/>American Beauty is one of the best movies I have ever seen and it continues to impress me each time that I view it. The ""look closer"" theme that was used in promoting this movie works equally well as a vaguely tantalizing introduction and a nice epilogue.

And I can't.  Because this film is about so much more than teenagers who think their parents are insane or adults that are on the verge of insanity and are so focused on what they want to see that they don't see the beauty in the truth until it is too late... so much more. The cinematography, script, direction and acting are nothing short of incredible.  Both Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening give the performances of their careers and I expect to see them with golden men in hand on a certain March night.  I should also say the same about Thora Birch.  I rarely enjoy watching actors of my own age but her performance was so brave and so touching...  Wes Bentley, whom I have never seen before this film has made a lasting impression.

","One of the best pictures all time. Story which we see in that film is true and often happening in our home. A crisis middle-aged is main line of that film. Our life is so short, but we don't understand it. We living don't see how many beautiful things around us.  And Lester Burnham begins to live how he wants. He is seeing all beauty, which we don't see in everyday crazy life. That beauty everywhere: at home, at work, in the store, at school and it give us a power to live.<br/><br/>This is very clever picture. Kevin Spacey plays absolutely fantastic. I think it best role in his career. In the film appears a new star of American cinema: Thora Birch, Mena Suvari and Wes Bentley. They played very good, too. This is my favorite film."
"Leonard Shelby","9","0","0","24 February 2001"," A beautiful film
","American Beauty is above all a film about feelings. Lester Burnham is a middle age man whose life has become too boring, everyday he has the same routine, till one day he decides to change. This could be a brief summary of the film. However, there is much more in this film that we can see in its plot. The films mainly deals with the American society, Lester is a product of that society, and how the ""American way of life"" can degenerate in a culture where life is a monotonous experience. At the same time this film wants to show that it's never too late, that people can change, but above all that life has to be enjoyed. We cannot allow our lives to become an empty experience. In the film there is a contrast between people who believe this, and act according to it, Lester, Ricky and Jane, and the other ones who live according to a society that is imposing rules on them, who live more worried about keeping appearances than about enjoying life. Lester's wife ambition to improve in her job, or Ricky's father obsession with discipline are two examples. The aim of the film is to show the life of these people living in a small street,  when we see the first image of the film, we have a huge  perspective, then it concentrates on Lester's street, because it could be any other street. The American beauty is all this, the way of life, ordinary people with ordinary jobs living in an ordinary home. However, if you look closer you realize there is more, each of this people is living a different life, the film shows these people to make us know that this is what life is all about, a man himself doesn't make any difference, but at least we can try to be happy in our ordinary lives."

This is an American movie, but not the ""We've got to help George Bailey"" kind of cheesy film.  Nobody in this film really hits it off, and after watching it, I thought ""all life is travesty"".

","The first time I have seen this movie I felt like ""What was this film about?"". Then I saw it a second time and a third time and it became better with every view. I can't remember a lot of American movies with THAT deepness and ""brain"". AMERICAN BEAUTY is far away from stupid Blockbuster-Popcorn-Entertainement and it isn't a boring independent film. It's just incredible how good Kevin Spacey plays ""Mr.Everybody Lester Barnes"". In my opinion, this IS his best role, far better than John Doe in Se7en or Keyser in Usual Suspects. Remember this film is Sam Mendes' first film as a director. But everything is just perfect: The music, the stomach-punching scenes, especially the end. The actors are well-chosen, from Spacey to ""materialistic wife"" Annette Bening, from ""Weirdo Next Door"" Wes Bentley and ""Lolita"" Mena Suvari to the incredible ""Addams Family-look-a-like"" Thora Birch. But please don't expect a non-brainer with silly jokes and stupid sex scenes. It's without question one of the best films of the 90's with a lot of things which are worth to thinking about. I give this film, as the only one beside ""Run Lola Run"", ""Dead Poet's Society"" and ""La vita e bella"", the highest possible rate: 10 out of 10. I'm looking forward to Mendes' next film.

","American Beauty is the kind of film that will capture your attention and never relent, yet at the same time allowing you to discern what the message is for yourself.  I experienced so many different emotions during the course of the film that I can say with 100% certainty that this movie won't inspire numbness, the inability to feel anything and not feel yourself changing as the film unfolds itself.  Indeed, you'll be changed, but will the closing message really mean anything to you?<br/><br/>The story, actually, is a rather simple one.  Lester Burnham(Kevin Spacey), your average American Joe, has been ""dead"" for a number of years.  His wife Carolyn(Annette Benning) orders him around, his daughter Jane(Thora Birch) is full of teenage angst, management at the workplace wants to fire him, and he sees no purpose or meaning in life.  To be blunt, he knows he doesn't matter in life and has an inability to do anything about it.  This all begins to change when he meets Jane's attractive friend Angela(Mena Suvari), as he is so overwhelmed by her beauty that he can't maintain control over himself, and he feels old sensations he had been blind to for so long.  She gives him a newfound mission and hence a new meaning for living life: He will win her heart and make love to her.  This inspires a direct rebellion of his life itself, and he vows never to be the same again.  Lester's metamorphosis during the rest of the film is very intriguing and fun to watch, as he finally is able to refute his selfish wife and become a ""winner"".  He proceeds to enjoy the splendors of life and ends up changing everyone else's as a result.  However, the message of the film does not come from Lester, but instead comes from new next door neighbor Ricky Fitz(Wes Bentley), a at-first-glance creepy 18-year old who is infamous for always carrying a video camera around with him.  When the viewer learns why he is always carrying this video camera, the main lesson of the film is taught, and enlightenment begins.  To say more about the plot of the film would be a crime, as it is best to experience it firsthand.<br/><br/>It was no surprise to me that American Beauty won 5 Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor.  It's uncanny that this is a directorial debut, from theatre expert Sam Mendes, and I'm anxiously anticipating his next work.  Every performance of the film is superb, with special recognition to Kevin Spacey and Thora Birch, the latter  being one who I could previously never imagine in a film like this after ""Hocus Pocus"" and ""Monkey Trouble"".  What really is endearing about this film, however, is the message.  Life is truly beautiful, and as the film demonstrates it in subtle and non-subtle methods, you can feel the exact elation Lester Burnham feels as he is emancipated from his old boring life.  This truly makes this a masterpiece, as it is not so much about what goes on during the film but what you feel as you watch. The idea of this film, while seemingly not too different than Ordinary People and The Ice Storm, is a LOT different.  The Ice Storm was too cynical and existentialist, and Ordinary People was a bit in the same vein.  All three films expose the hypocrisy of modern American society, but only American Beauty leaves hope, and how truthful and God-inspired it feels.  This film is truly a masterpiece and one that every person should be privileged enough to see.  I recommend it with all of my heart, and I encourage anyone reading this to view it with an open mind, as it might seem a little wacky and hence distractful of the message if you're not careful.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10, a truly must-see film."

","This is a great film. Give the Oscar to Spacey, and probably one to Bening.<br/><br/>
This is a hard film to categorize. I'm reminded of Princess Bride, not a similar film, but a film that was also hard to promote because it wasn't just one kind of movie. I didn't know much about the film when I went, but was put off by the only plot line I knew, that a middleage dad falls in love with his daughter's friend. That never dominates the film, fortunately. As Spacey is swept away by his personal life changes, the question of will he or won't he make it with the daughter's friend is put on the back shelf for most of the film.<br/><br/>This is a completely wonderful film, but it left me wondering something. Virtually everybody's life in this movie is destroyed. It leaves the viewer to speculate how each character left standing will adapt. Why, then, did I have such a feeling of wonder about it? In many ways, it's Ordinary People with laughs. It works because Spacey shows how somebody can find himself after years in a wasteland. Wes Bentley, the boy next door, has a gift for seeing the beauty in all things, and for feeling a connection with the flow of the universe. The film shows us those gifts, and that's part of its success. <br/><br/>The movie also shows on a subtle plane the power of the spoken word. There's this idea that anything we say is broadcast to the mystical universe, then created for us if our intention or power is strong enough. There's a point in the film when Spacey says he will frame the company's management evaluator, Brad, for sexual misconduct. Later in the film, it is Spacey who is framed for sexual misconduct, as seen by the retired Marine colonel. Similarly, Spacey's daughter wants her dad dead, Wes Bentley offers to do it, and even though they both agree it isn't  something they really want, conditions are changed just enough to create that reality.<br/><br/>
I hope this film gets the Oscars, but it's dark and risky. I admire the cast for putting so much into this film, knowing that when they entered the project. You can't run ads for it as a feel good movie, but I left the theater wanting to see a plastic bag being whipped around by the wind."

This is the kind of movie that you have to be smart to watch, and it gives me just so much inspiration and warmth inside. <br/><br/>Everyone in the movie you can somehow identify with, like Lester trying to recapture his innocence of youth, Carolyn and her willing to strive for excellence, Jane and how we are always trying to change something about ourselves that is not exactly necessary or even needed, Angela, and out wanting to be perfect and socially accepted, Colonel Fitts, who wants order and discipline in life, and Ricky, who is confident and supportive, realizing there is so much beauty in life that people just cannot understand. Directing was excellent, and so was Ricky's speech about the bag, Lester's speech at the end, and everything else.

","I was really unprepared for what I saw when I first watched 'American Beauty' - having seen various clips from the film I was expecting a middleweight comedy-drama about a man in mid-life crisis. I assumed the fixation that Kevin Spacey has with his daughters Lolita-like schoolfriend would allow for some poignant humour all concluding in an upbeat happy ending. On realising instead that the film offered a bleak examination of the meaning of life, it was difficult to adjust my perspective in time.<br/><br/>Needless to say 'American Beauty' is quite superb - as a directorial debut it rivals 'Citizen Kane' and as a total package the film scores on every level. The performances are outstanding across the board; as good as Kevin Spacey is, his character doesn't dominate the film and he is matched by the trio of younger performers. Mena Suvari is perfect in a role that could have been so shallow - whilst Wes Bentley and Thora Birch breeze through more demanding parts with ease.<br/><br/>This is one of those rare films which is enjoyable to watch, but also manages to raise issues that make us question our outlook on life. <br/><br/>BEST SCENE - lots of contenders, but the shot of the plastic carrier bag being blown around has to get my vote."

","American Beauty is a good film whose reputation has gotten way out of hand and whose quality and artistic merits have become far too overrated.  Yes, it is better than a lot of movies out there, but it is not the masterpiece that everyone seems to think.  It was not the best film of 1999, nor did it deserve all the hype, awards, and attention that were bestowed upon it.<br/><br/>Its story and themes aren't anything original or shocking, and all the great weight and meaning that it thinks it has are much more hollow and shallow than it wishes to believe.  Suburban, white-bread America isn't perfect? You're kidding me!  American Beauty is a glossy Hollywood satire that has the usual Hollywood ego of thinking it is an artistic masterpiece.  It is well-written - there are some funny and beautiful moments, not badly directed, well photographed and scored, the acting is sincere, I think, and everyone involved seems to have good intentions, but, at the end, it doesn't add up to as much as it aspires.  It was better the first time I saw it when it was called The Ice Storm, or the other time when it was called Ordinary People (Best Picture 1980), or the other time when it was called The Graduate, or the other time as Rebel Without a Cause.<br/><br/>Aside from the fact that it is just retreading some of this old material, there were a few other things that bothered me.  One of the major drawing points is all the fetishized female teenage sexuality; this and all of the unnecessary nudity bothered me - these are teenage characters, after all - it's uncomfortable the way in which they were sexualized and objectified. Also, aren't we past the point as a society where the psycho ends up being the repressed homosexual?  Also, Kevin Spacey's highly acclaimed performance consisted of being sarcastic for 2 hours.  He's been much better in other films that required a greater range of his dramatic skill.  Finally, what's the point of telling us at the beginning that Lester is going to be killed? Don't tell us, and let the end come as the shock that it could have been."
"xiabelle","10","0","0","3 February 2001"," Sublime and affecting
","I finally saw this film after having intended to ever since I first saw the trailers and I have but one word to say about it: sublime. This movie is beautiful, but it is the kind of beauty which is horrifying to behold. Much of what is said is not what is said physically, but is represented in the way the camera pans, or the dialogue is delivered. The events that happen within the film are absurd, but they're jarring: they could be real. It's entirely possible this could happen. What's lurking beneath our facades? The fact that Lester is not happy until his life begins to fall apart is terrible, but the message is not that we should have our lives fall apart, but that we should live. Even though the style of living the characters choose is terrible, what the film is underscoring is one simple fact: they're alive, and they're suddenly living and breathing and feeling the air like they hadn't before. It's not a promotion of the lifestyles -- it is a depiction of what happens when we allows our lives to become so bogged down in others that we forget about ourselves, and our only solution is a violent ricochet in the opposite direction. Lester's moment of clarity, that he is going great even when life has been horrible, is telling.<br/><br/>
It's a rare film that leaves me in tears, but this was one of them: the resonance of it stays with you, and keeps you thinking. The beauty here is dark, but it exists. It lies within the irony of our every day world, and the way we all create our own beauty, as we see it, when we live."

""American Beauty"" is  the story of a man breaking free of everything that hinders him from true happiness: his wife, his job, his responsibility.

Is there any other better description of a suburban family?  ""American Beauty"" tells the story of their lives, and the people they meet, and the development which takes place.  ""American Beauty"" was just full of unique, well casted characters who showed how they lived and how their actions affected others.

"MotoMike","Null","0","0","30 September 1999"," ""Beauty"" is barely skin deep
","It's rare that I disagree with so many critics and other viewers about a movie, and to my surprise, that happened in this movie with two of my favorite screen actors: Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening. I would willingly watch Spacey read a phone book, and Bening can do no wrong in my book. Yet despite their absolutely top-notch performances, great direction, and snappy dialog, I can't put this movie on the same level as other viewers have for two major (to me) reasons:<br/><br/>1. The Burnham family is initially in a state of deep dysfunction. They don't talk; they don't often get together, and they appear to evince a lot of symptoms of a family with deep problems. But why? Problems of this sort are usually caused by way too much career involvement on the part of one or both spouses, substance abuse, or some pretty strong personality problems - yet none of these is happening. Carolyn has time to cook those dinners (asparagus and all!); Lester is only working one job, and neither of them shows any sign of real burnout. In fact, those dinners are a symptom of what's wrong with the script: families that take the time to eat together regularly typically have far fewer problems than those where they never do. A far more realistic scenario would have been Carolyn never being home for dinner or weekends: that's what real estate agents do. The point is that if this is intended even slightly as a cautionary fable, we are not told how they got into this state. A contrast is the film ""Ordinary People"" (which this film resembles in many ways), in which the precipitating incident was the brother's death. Here we are expected to take it on faith that these smart and relatively with-it people have allowed their relationship to deteriorate to this point. I know a lot of suburban families with teenagers - I live in American suburbia myself - and I don't know any families like this: that have deteriorated to this point of mutual loathing.<br/><br/>2. The other beef I have is with the characters. They are what I call Hollywood characters, in that they all are more recognizable from having seen their ancestors on the big and little screens far more than in real life. Carolyn is a caricature of Mary Tyler Moore in Ordinary People; Col. Fitts (next door) is the way-too-controlling ex-military sicko we've seen over and over again in Pat Conroy's books and on TV. Angela is straight out of Fast Times at Ridgemont High as well as Beverly Hills 90210; Jane, dialog and all, is out of My So-Called Life; I could go on, but you get the point. The only characters that were fairly original were Spacey's and Ricky, the neighbor kid. Now, for Hollywood characters, they were well written and I liked/disliked/empathized with all of them as expected - they weren't cardboard cutouts. But they were the type of character written by people who spend most of their time in the movie or TV business - and I will never know people like them.<br/><br/>I think that the excellence of so many other parts of this movie either overcame these objections or seduced a lot of people into thinking that this movie is better than it is. It has crackling dialog, and the climax is amazing in how it brings resolution to so many story lines woven together. I liked Lester's redemption and the last line enormously. It's just that I came away with a slightly sour taste in my mouth from this NutraSweet film."

What Lester confronted and experienced is happening to 'middle-aged' men all around the world, not just in suburban America. Call it mid-life crisis or what you will, but I'll bet there are thousands of men who identified with Lester, even though they may not openly admit it. 10/10."

","Frankly, the academy should have not ruined the greatest year of film making by calling this movie the best one.  There is a lot intregue in this movie but it full of errors and has no sense. Kevin Spacey is the only reason this film got any attention and I found his performances were better in The Usual Suspects and The Nagotaitor. The worst thing about this film is it demonstrates that irresponability in a adults is a good thing. If that is true our world is about to fall a part. This movie almost glamorizes drugs. Enough of the Negitive! The movie is slow but brings out life in middle age people and that is why it is so popular with the Acedemy. The charactors are powerful and it shows us that money doesn't give us life it takes it away.  This movie doesn't campare to Episode I, South Park,The Matrix, Dogma, or The Sixth Sense for 1999 movies but is entertaining at least."

","You know what it's like...everyone tells you that you should watch a film. You sit down bristling with anticipation .... and end up sorely disappointed. Well, with American Beauty for once that didn't happen. Sam Mendes has directed a film which is very close to perfection. A lot of this hangs on the script - a subtle subversion of American suburbia. As others have said, this film is about more than a man suffering a mid-life crisis - it exposes how fragile the make-up of our daily lives can be. Through following the Burnham family we get a comic, tragic, sad, exhilarating glimpse of life. And this is achieved largely from the fabulous performances Mendes extracts from the entire cast. Kevin Spacey, as ever, is flawless. This man must be one of the greatest actors of his generation. Annette Bening excels as his frustrated wife, and the young cast who play the teenagers all demonstrate admirable talents. I can not recommend too strongly that, if you haven't, you try American Beauty.....a film that truly deserves all of the enthusiastic attention it has received."

","A true horror film. Why? Because these monsters are real! This film is a reflection of our society. The reflection is real and greatly magnified. Mirror, mirror on the wall who is the most screwed up of all. `American Beauty' answers such a question quite well and I don' t find it very entertaining. Movies that I like make me think, laugh, cry, or be pissed off, but this one drains the dopamine out of my nerve centers. Its another depressing movie that Hollywood uses to promote cynicism of the American dream and to stereotype suburbia. The movie portrays middle class as mean spirited, oppressed, unfaithful, fake, hypocritical, gun toten homophobes who would pluck the gold from your molars before the ink dried on your death certificate. Its not by accident that liberal Hollywood depicts<br/><br/>in this film a gay couple as the happiest, healthiest, friendliest and most wholesome of the entire neighborhood while attempting to portray a Norman Rockwell lifestyle as a bogus facsimile of an old American fantasy.<br/><br/>
However,this movie does pack a powerful punch. It has great acting by Kevin Spacey, Annette Benning, Thora Birch, and Wes Bentley. It has a plot that is very artistically twisted (just like the characters).  It has an ending that surprises the viewer. It also has a smorgasbord of society's issues that many can dip onto their plate and relate to.  Lets see a sample of the main entrees: We have unfaithful spouses, mid life crisis, large portions of depression, freshly stewed low self esteem, and hot off the grill anger. It also has a very delectable side bar of tasty morsels: It serves up closet homosexuals and out of the closet homosexuals, drug addiction, murder, money and power struggles,  hard headed, violent and bigoted military figures, teenage identity crisis. And for dessert: Lets try some 17 year old breast, a woman's feet flying up in the air, sexual fantasies, a man jerking off in the shower and a mild twist of humor for flavoring. Uhmmmm ! Sounds good? Not to this movie watcher. Belch!!  Where are the `Tums'?  I didn't escape in this movie; I was sucked into this movie like a farmer pulled into a corn picker and maimed from the inside out. I see so much pain in this movie and we all grow numb of it. I found the world news more refreshing. What a downer.<br/><br/>I gave this movie an anemic 6. It is greatly overrated and I hope not a classic. If it becomes a classic I fear what we have become as a whole. Its another flick that I am amazed at the amount of high scores. Maybe that proves the old saying that misery loves company. I called this a horror movie, but a disaster movie may be a more realistic classification.  It should be called `Erosion'. Erosion of society, the American dream, and family values and gives power to pursuing ones desires first while putting everyone close to you in the shadows. I once watched a movie that reflected a part of America called, `The Grapes of Wrath'. It made me very grateful of where we have come and this one `American Beauty' makes fearful of where we are going."

","Simply a perfect movie.  Sam Mendes' gives us a spectacular adaptation of Alan Ball's tale of the hidden underbelly of sedate suburbia.  Kevin Spacey is subtly breathtaking as Lester, a man on the verge of his mid-life crisis. Annette Bening is equal to the task as his neurotic possession-obsessed spouse.  The tension between them is palpable and convincing, as is the conflict they have with their daughter played wonderfully by 17-year-old Thora Birch.  Through their family dynamic as well as the one examined next door at the Fitts household, we see that all is not well within the confines of our white picket fences.  Mendes' use of slow motion photography and music gives us ample opportunity to peer into the fantasies Lester Burnham has created to combat the tedium of his anaesthetized existence.  The object of his lust, a superficial yet vulnerable comulsive liar, is portrayed beautifully by Mena Suvari, who rebounds in a big way from her somewhat wooden role in American Pie. This movie blossoms on every level and obviously smelled sweet to the Academy. As Lester would say, this movie RULES."

","A line from Keats' ""Ode on a Grecian Urn"" has stuck with me over the years: ""Beauty is truth, Truth beauty."" I think that could have been the tagline for this movie. Many people have seen this movie and not understood what it was all about, but if you pardon my immodesty, I think I kinda got the message. The movie begins by introducing us to some characters who are all unhappy for one reason or another. However, when one of them (Kevin Spacey, who deserved every award he got for this performance) begins being true to himself by 1) admitting that he is unhappy and 2) taking steps to change his situation, he is finally happy. Then, throughout the course of the movie we learn how everyone else is being false to him or herself, and when they acknowledge their unhappiness they can finally take steps to change. The only character who is happy through the entire movie is Ricky, whose eyes have been open to beauty and happiness much longer than everyone else's. Once you mull over this movie carefully, you realize that it is a spectacular commentary on today's society; we see a lot of people who should, according to society, be happy (they have family, success, etc.) but they are not because they aren't being true to themselves. It is up to everyone to find his or her own happiness."

It typifies Hollywood in the late 1990's in that it is completely politically correct, stereotypical and elitist. What shlock. If a screenwriter were told to sit down and write a script that derided every aspect of American life that liberal Hollywood actors, directors, producers etc. despise, and to do it in as stereotypical and obnoxious (not funny, except for a few rare moments) a manner as possible, this movie would be the end result.

"Gary-161","Null","0","0","5 January 2001"," *SPOILERS*
","I suspect the reason this film is so awful is due to studio politics and the compromises that have to be made in order to get projects off the ground in an increasingly prohibitively expensive medium.  Certainly the director Sam Mendes had to abandon his first attempt, probably because the script is such piffle it's hard to make it work.  He gave it his best shot though, fair enough. This isn't the truth about America, it's one script writer's view of his audience and judging by his CV he has not done a great deal other than work in sitcom, which says a lot about the structure, approach and choices made in this film.  Trite scenes such as the throwing of the plate (queue canned laughter) and Bening's unconvincing behaviour in selling a house for instance.  Nothing works or convinces, especially the fatuous notion that a father should be murdered for 'ignoring' his sibling. I suspect the writer threw in other stuff garnered from 'Sex, Lies And Video Tape' and a tasteless who-dunnit element in an attempt to make the picture seem familiar and entertaining for the audience.  The bottom line was always money, not profundity.<br/><br/>I think I'm right in saying Geffin had a hand in backing this film and there has been talk recently of a 'gay clique' in Hollywood and it's influence on the film-making process. I don't know if that's the case here but the gay couple are signalled straight away as being the happiest.  The film also plugs the usual gay propaganda that anyone who dislikes gays must automatically be in the closet.  The scene where such an alleged person punches his son full in the stomach for touching a plate is particularly unconvincing and pernicious.  The portrayal of the wife and women in general all seems to come from a certain questionable perspective.<br/><br/>The so-called spiritual element about the nature of beauty produces an unbelievably laughable scene involving a bag.  One character looks at the blood matter of a brain with a hippy dippy stare that seems to say ""Wow man, it's so bea-u-ti-ful!"" I cannot believe anyone takes these preposterous contrivances with dead birds and the like seriously.  It's palpable nonsense.<br/><br/>All this huffing and puffing just for a reactionary 'Wizard Of Oz' homily about a family picture and 'there's no place like home.' The film then fobs you off with some sentimental voice-over guff about leaves and the loss of youth.  As the camera pulls back over suburbia and the patronising final sentiments are spoken, I get the impression that someone's behind the screen giggling ""My God, are they really BUYING all of this?"" Only the sheep.<br/><br/>The reality is that America has oppressed a large number of weaker and poorer countries over the last three decades in the guise of fighting Communism.  Very few people seem to be aware of the real horror that has gone on in central America and America's hand in it and the third world in general, and at the expense and loss of life of some of the poorest in those societies.  America is not the evil of the world but in the light of this enormous suffering and loss of an experience that only comes once to us all, are we really expected to care about the facile 'sufferings' of Burnham and his wife and their arguments about damaging the sofa?  Americans love this film because very few of them have suffered real injustice in their lives, the kind you suffer if you're born in Sudan, for instance.  A price has been paid for such comforts and Americans should be grateful for the lives they have, and not whinge.  Materialism does not necessarily mean the loss of inner worth or the ability to deepen one's world.  Many have been freed to pursue personal expression, such as making drivel like this film.  We should all be grateful for what we have in the time we have left, which in the face of increasing super-technology weapon attainment, may not be long.<br/><br/>American Beauty's sincerity is disingenuous.  It's purpose is to make Americans feel safe and good about themselves so that the people behind it will be successful and make money.  There is a machine that has to be fed and a huge amount of talent-less people are out there figuring out increasingly desperate ways to do just that. 'American Beauty' incapsulates all that is glib, meretricious and plain wrong about modern cinema and as such is, in my opinion, one of the very worst films ever made."

","The trailer of this movie, and I am referring to the original trailer and not the new one currently being circulated(Which I have not seen yet) creates this great enigmatic vortex that sucks you in.  ""Look closer"" it says and pretty soon there is no way you can resist unraveling this enigma. What is so different about all of these characters?  We'll see.<br/><br/>Coming of age stories have been recently...maturing.  With movies like Rushmore in which it is hard to see what separates adults from the young folk they once were we have a new view into what it takes to really ""Come of Age"".  It is an acceptance for what happens and what will happen, but not with complete compliance.  It is about being understanding and open.  It is seeing the world not from categorical norms, but from a new heightened level.  It is the desire for progress, and not accepting the limitations that we or others have placed on us.  It can happen at anytime. <br/><br/>
In American Beauty it does...to a number of people.  These characters are fascinating.  They are a complex web.  The more you study it the easier it becomes to notice the individual strands that make up this unit and the ones that form each individual as well.  And these strands, these people you can sink your teeth into and say 'I know that taste...It tastes like me'.<br/><br/>After one viewing I have perceived this much and more that still awaits processing.  While watching this I was enveloped by these enigmatic characters and circumstances and it will take a number of viewings to peel its outer wrapping and its inner wrapping and its protective shell to finally see all that it has to offer.  I like that.<br/><br/>This is a powerful and deep movie, and not just because of what you might not understand just after its first viewing, but also due to what is understood.  <br/><br/>Still one question remains that may or may not be so important, but is a big part of the Enigma surrounding this film...Why ""AMERICAN Beauty""?  Is it because this type of coming of age is only possible in the states?  Is it due to the fact that it is an American movie?  Is it because the filmmakers were influenced by Mena Suvari who earlier in the summer acted in American Pie?  Maybe next time I view this film it will dawn on me.  Maybe not.

","I bought this on DVD, having missed it in the theaters, because I wanted to have the best possible viewing experience.  I'm glad I bought it, and I'm glad I watched it, and I'll watch it again .... but this is not the masterpiece that the hype suggests.  It's far from being the sixth-best film of all time, no matter what IMDB reviewers say.<br/><br/>Good things first, though: the performances of Spacey and to a lesser extent Bening were terrific.  Spacey is cementing his reputation for being one of the most versatile and compelling actors of his generation.  Bening's performance here is probably her best; normally, I would consider her a passable actress, but she is simply excellent in AB.  The supporting cast delivers solid or better performances.  Peter Gallagher was quite understated.  (But what the heck was Scott Bakula doing in such a throwaway role?)<br/><br/>**** SPOILERS AHEAD *****<br/><br/>While the dialogue and plot were well thought-out, I was somewhat annoyed by the standard Hollowwood archetypes and scapegoats.  The talent of Bening and Spacey avoided making their characters the now-standard emasculated hubby/castrating wife stereotypes, but didn't Spacey cover some of the same ground in ""The Ref""?  It seemed to me that The Ref's satire was more biting and more true than here in AB.<br/><br/>Isn't it time to retire the abusive-military-guy-who-hates-gays-but-secretly-is-one cliche?  Chris Cooper is an excellent actor but even Olivier couldn't rise above this characterization.  He's a seething cauldron of hate, so guess who's the bad guy at the end of the movie?  I saw that one coming a mile away.  While we're at it, let's let the BRUNETTE be a bimbo for once and let the BLONDE have more than 5 working brain cells, okay?  And can we please, please, PLEASE get rid of the ""I'm brooding, so I must be deep and philosophical"" characters.<br/><br/>The problem with this very good film is that Hollowwood considers suburban family life to be its arch-enemy (along with the military), and AB's point of view is jaundiced by this and therefore lacks true substance.  I wound up thinking that although the movie was well-made and well-acted, I didn't know any of the people, except Spacey and Bening.  There was no resonance to any other characters.  The end result is that you feel deeply involved in the action, but the characters (and ultimately, therefore, the plot) seem contrived.<br/><br/>I'd definitely recommend it for viewing.  If you feel suburbia is greatly peopled by the above stereotypes, you may have more appreciation for American Beauty than I did."

He relies much too heavily on caricature, and overused caricature at that. As a result, we're kept at a distance from the very people we should be seeing up-close and in intimate detail. These lives feel designed for our instruction rather than actually lived, and ""American Beauty"" feels like a warning against some imagined suburban lifestyle rather than a drama about fully rendered human beings."

Masturbating in the shower is the high point of his day he tells us,""it's all down hill from here"".

","I have seen just about every movie made in the last 20 years. In my family saturdays have always been movie nights and have been for a long long time. We see 90% turkeys and 10% classics. American Beauty goes above and beyond them all. The most intelligent, thoughtful, passionate movie I have seen in a Decade or more.  I found myself asking again and again how can this be so good? How can it be so sad and hysterically funny at the same time. With the absolutely perfect sound track to make your emotions run the gambit, and a stellar cast who did an incredible job with this amazing script. With a director who made his debut legendary, this film surpassed my wildest expectations.  It made me feel more emotions than I do in my ordinary life everyday.  It also made me ""look closer"" at my life and the peoples around me and I saw beauty and strangeness I had never noticed before.  Thank you Mr. Mendes and the entire cast of American Beauty for making a film that actually makes desensatized people like myself actually begin to feel something again. I recommend this film to anyone with a brain.  However, people who are easily offended, prudish, or sheeplike and unable to think for themselves should steer clear of this movie due to the fact that it touches real yet uncomfortable subjects such as drugs and homosexuality/homophobia. This movie gets the highest rating possible in my and many others opinions... So... Look Closer... and ENJOY!"

","What else can be said about this truly stunning piece of film making.  I remember leaving the theatre after viewing the film and ""wow"" was the most original thing I could come up with to describe my thoughts and feelings about this movie.  I was blown away. So blown away that it is impossible to put it into words.<br/><br/>When I first heard about this movie, I will admit, I had no desire to see it.  However, with the high accolades it received at the Oscars, I figured the film had to be about more than a 40-something guy who falls for a teenage girl.  And it was.  <br/><br/>This is the type of movie that requires several viewings - and on each subsequent viewing, you will surely see something that you hadn't noticed the first time.  The signature of a truly great and thought provoking film. It is almost impossible to view this film without seeing something of yourself in one or more of the characters.  I surely did (although I won't mention which one), and it is a real eye opener and often not flattering to see ""yourself"" and ""your life"" portrayed on screen in such a way.  Albeit, it may be taken to the extreme, but the effect is there. <br/><br/>
The stunning performances by the entire cast were truly the focal point of this character driven movie - with Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening deserving the accolades and awards bestowed on them.  I could have done without Mena Suvari as I found her character to be quite irritating, but I suspect that this was the intention.  <br/><br/>It still amazes me that there are so many negative comments about this movie - I personally know several people who thought it was the dumbest movie they ever saw.  My only comment for this small percentage of the viewing population is that you just didn't get it.  Perhaps, it just hit a little too close to home and that admitting that it was a wonderful film would be admitting that you saw a little of yourselves in this film and didn't like what you saw.  <br/><br/>This is a movie about everyone's search for beauty in their own lives and how beauty can mean so many different things to so many different people. It is deep, thought provoking and goes far beyond what you actually see on the screen.  See it if you want to change your outlook on life - it will help you see beauty in even the simplest of things and in your quest for beauty in your own life.  <br/><br/>A masterpiece!"

This is another typical Hollywood screed against the regular American family ala Blue Velvet, the Ice Storm, etc which tries REAL hard to be a 'realistic portrait', when in reality it's about as accurate as yer average episode of 'Dallas', 'Barney' or 'Sanford and Son'(Personally I'd go with Fred Sanford myself...).<br/><br/>Everyone is neurotic, shrill, a fake or doomed. No one is like the average regular fellers you and I grew up with, went to school with or are related to(well, not All of them anyways...)..I fail to see what great truths we have here. People get mid-life crisises when they are in their 40s at times. Yeah, so? People have marital problems, sometimes they screw around on each other. And? Teenagers, some anyways, lie about how much sex they've had, or do drugs, or hate their folks. Yeah, this was true in 1958, '66, 76, '88 and it will be true 50 years from now. What is the great point here?<br/><br/>I took away nothing from this save that Spacey, Bening, Cooper and co are all fine actors, though I preferred Cooper in 'Lonestar' and Bening always has the same affect on me as Carol Burnette-the teeth get to hurting after too much exposure.<br/><br/>The blonde gal was cute but way too Alicia Silverstone/Kirsten Dunst/blonde of the month for me to notice much. I liked Thora Birch's Christina Ricci turn though.<br/><br/>Personally, I am Very glad I only rented this one for 3 bucks, anything more and I woulda walked outta the theatre half ways.<br/><br/>**1/2 max from me.

","Had it not been for Hillary Swank's unbelievable performance in ""Boys Don't Cry,"" Annette Benning surely would have won ""Best Actress"" as this was possibly one of the best performances in the past decade. Kevin Spacey, confirmed by his oscar, also did a superb job. But strong performances are not the only elements of a masterpiece, and this film lacks certain qualities or attributes that would elevate it to that status.<br/><br/>Despite the humor and irony, this film is quite perverse, not necessarily because of Lester's obsession with a teenager but because almost EVERY scene involves dialogue that centres around sex (and it is often quite vulgar). Had it not been so unrelenting, I would not be bothered by this, but we are bombarded with crude dialogue throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>This is something I did not notice the first time I saw ""American Beauty"". However, watching for a second time, I couldn't help but feel that it was overdone and inappropriate.  Had it been a bit more subtle it would have been perfect, but it was too much.<br/><br/>Next time you watch this movie, try to take notice just how often there are crude references or sexual images.  Normally I have no problem with such things in a film, but in one so lauded and praised, I had a hard time understanding the appropriateness.<br/><br/>Concerning the plot, I was eerily reminded of a Seinfeld episode gone awry. Such misunderstandings would not occur in real-life because people would not behave in the way these characters did. Although the character Lester might be easily related to by many men (and maybe women too, I don't know, I can't really speak for them) the situation surrounding him and events that occur around him are a little hard to believe.<br/><br/>It is these factors I feel detract from this film and keep it from the level from which critics have elevated it. A superb film, one deserving the Academy Award for best picture? Perhaps.  But not an all-time classic."

","It always surprises me how when stuff like this ends up on ""The Jerry Springer Show"" (and he does have TONS of stuff like what's in this film), it's touted as ""trash"".  Yet, when it finds its way to the big screen, it can win Oscars.  Hmm.  And number 6 on IMDB's top 250 list?  Wow!  Anywho, a working stiff loser (Spacey) decides to spice up his life with hasty decisions.  Meanwhile, his perky-beyond-belief wife (Bening) shakes things up as well, and their sad sack daughter (Birch) begins a fascination with a peeping Tom (Bentley) next door.  That's basically it, but writer Ball juices up the proceedings with trendy, 90's explicit dialogue and outrageous situations.  That was my only problem with this.  In terms of pace and entertainment value, the happenings were fine.  In terms of believability, I didn't think for a second this could take place where it's all set.  Upper class suburbia?  Not-uh.  Where Jerry Springer's guests reside, maybe.  The fact that two families, equally mentally unbalanced, could be living next door to each other, was too unrealistic for me.  At least the performances should grab you.  Spacey, doing yet another rendition of his soft spoken, cool, confident type characters, is terrific as the sarcastic Lester. Bening, I would guess, purposely overdid the phoney, smiley housewife well enough.  Birch, a looong way from her child acting days, does nicely as the alienated teen.  Supporting them were Suvari, the sexy teen bimbo obsession of Spacey's, and Bentley as the creepy guy next door.  They give you lots to chew on, plus an ending with a couple of surprises.  But as we usually see in films, after the big climax, the credits roll and we never find out the fate of some of the characters.  Always annoying.  Though I would never hail it as high as most, still a graphically interesting ride for those not shy about sex and morality."

","Lester Burnham hates his life. He hates his mediocre job and the corporate brown-nosing it involves, he hates the fact that his wife and daughter think he's a total loser, and he's none too impressed with the inevitability of middle age decline either. But rather than having a mid-life crisis, Lester instead opts for a much more positive approach - a sort of mid-life rebirth. To some extent, his newly rediscovered youthful vigour is triggered by the resurgent lust he feels for his daughter's teenage friend, Angela.<br/><br/>
Suddenly it's time for radical life change; he quits his job - an occupation which apparently involves ""jacking off to a fantasy life that doesn't quite so closely resemble hell"", befriends the weird teenage loner next door, starts smoking copious amounts of extremely potent weed and begins a fitness programme that will make him ""look good naked"". <br/><br/>It's almost impossible to categorise this film, as it encapsulates so many themes and dramatic conventions. Kevin Spacey's narration immediately signifies that his character is deceased - so there's the who-done-it? element. It's extremely funny in parts, but in no way could it be described as a comedy. It's a romance of sorts, where love and relationships are at first satirised and dissected, but ultimately idealised. And to call it melodrama is oversimplifying matters, ignoring the depth of social commentary and indeed the whole promotion of a philosophical discussion on the meaning of life and perhaps more significantly, death.<br/><br/>
Spacey has misfired in a couple of questionable roles recently, principally 'The Negotiator' and to a lesser extent 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil', but his Oscar winning turn as a latter day Willy Loman sees a successful return to the kind of form usually associated with 'The Usual Suspects' and 'Seven' star. Annette Bening is in career best mode as Carolyn, the most frighteningly neurotic female lead since Liz Taylor's Martha in 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf', and the newcomers Wes Bentley as Ricky, Mena Suvari as Angela and perhaps the biggest revelation of all - Thora Birch as Jane - all hold there own in an excellent ensemble cast. In fact this movie succeeds in interweaving a series of slice-of-life plotlines to better effect than Paul Anderson's plodding 'Magnolia' or even the benchmark by which all multi-layered American dramas are judged, Altman's 'Shortcuts'. The reason this structure works so effectively is that it doesn't insult the audience's intelligence by employing scenarios that entirely rely on coincidence, alternatively using a more realistic narrative approach. <br/><br/>The movie has a feel of 'Peyton Place' gone awry, or a 'Blue Velvet' minus the Lynch-esque surrealism. It's a tribute to the faith invested in debutante Sam Mendes directorial skills that this thought provoking masterpiece was handled with such understated flair and sincerity. Mind you, he did have all the experience that years spent as a theatre director brings and award-winning Conrad Hall as his cinematographer, and along with Thomas Newman's poignant score, this combination dictates the whole atmosphere.<br/><br/>

","""This is the highlight of my day.  It all goes downhill from here""  This line delivered by Kevin Spacey in his usual dead-pan voice while his character, Lester Burnham, is masturbating in the shower, sets the scene for the entire film - a film that left both me and my friend dumbfounded as we left the cinema.<br/><br/>As I hadn't read any of the reviews before going to see the film (as is my custom), I had no idea what I was going to see.  All I knew was that this was the film that had sold out across London's West-End while on limited released.  What I received is one of the most awe-inspiring and deeply profound films I have ever seen!  Not only does it rip open the pretense that everybody in America is happy and ready to live the American Dream, it deals with a subject that many films are afraid to show - an older man lusting after an under-age girl.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey is wonderful as Lester, a man trapped in a pitiful life.  He deserved his Oscar and might well become the Jack Lemmon of our generation - an acting genius.  However, I feel that Annette Bening's nomination was undeserved - yes she was brilliant as Carolyn, but she didn't have the emotional underlayings that Spacey gave to his character.  If I were on the Academy, I'd have nominated Wes Bentley as Best Supporting Actor and Thora Birch as Best Supporting Actress - both gave their characters their all, and managed to portray them so realistically!<br/><br/>My one complaint about this film is Mena Suvari.  I think that she was cast in the role of Angela simply because of her looks and not her acting ability.  However, saying that, I can't imagine anybody else in her role!"

","Wow is a one word review of this film. This year has brought many beautiful surprises but none shine as bright as American Beauty. The story however tragic, is uplifting at the same time. Kevin Spacey is magnificent and plays his role perfectly. I would imagine this role will earn him an Oscar nomination because frankly it is the best performance I've seen lately. To give a basic run down of the movie think, Falling Down without the hostility. Kevin Spacey is awakened from his monotonous daily life where the only thing he looks forward to is jacking off in the shower every morning. Suddenly, he is a new man. Doing what he wants when he wants. Risks aren't risks, they just become decisions. No worries, no problems. He lives life like everyone wants to but at the same time, aren't willing to take the risk to do it. At the same time, Spacey's daughter hates her parents. She thinks her dad is a complete idiot and has no interest in her (which couldn't be further from the truth). Her mom is a Martha Stewart in the making , minus the compassion and patience needed in raising a child. All the while, the new neighbors move in. Their son is a voyeur (a s***ty label but what else do you call someone who videotapes everything) who has taken an interest in the daughter and silently watches from afar. That's about all I wanna say so you can experience this movie. Like the director says, it sounds like a messed up sitcom but believe me when you see it you won't feel that way."

","American Beauty is a perfect example of why the movie industry might as well post ""Adults over 40 not admitted"" signs in front of every theater in the land. Combine every kind of deviant behavior this side of Silence of the Lambs with good acting and quality lighting and photographic effects and you have a recipe for best picture. I guess. One of the younger set said this: ""There weren't any good movies last year."" I guess not. Yes, this is a thoughtful presentation and Kevin Spacey, in particular, does a terrific job of delivering the script and the director's wishes. But this is life? This is beauty? It's not impossible to do quality without visiting the seamy side. Give me an hour and I can give you a list of 100 movies made in the last decade that offer a quality look, compelling dialogue and thought-provoking circumstances -- without glorifying anti-social behavior or getting into the world of guns and drugs. Most of the time, the politicians and do-gooders who want to clean up Hollywood turn my stomach. But if the industry and the movie-going public feel American Beauty is top of the line, maybe it's time to listen to the clean up Hollywood bunch."

","If anybody still clings to the decades old ""Leave it to Beaver"" style interpretation of a nuclear family, then American Beauty will shatter that image. <br/><br/>Kevin Spacey is incredible as Lester Burnham, a man that hates his job, is manipulated by his wife Carolyn, and ignored by his daughter Jane. Into this humdrum life comes Mena Suvari, whom plays Jane's friend Angela. Lester soon finds himself fantasizing about Angela in the worst way. Next door, a retired Marine Colonel and his son with a propensity for video taping every move Jane makes moves in next door. Several plots exist throughout the film, the most intriguing is Burnham's gradual awakening as to how he can improve his life. We see him go from being a depressed shell of a man to leading a carefree existence, when he is no longer afraid of speaking up for himself.<br/><br/>
American Beauty is certainly not for everyone's tastes. For many viewers, this movie may uncomfortably hit home, with adultery, drug use, homo-sexuality, over-achieving, (and under-achieving) in the workplace, communication breakdowns within the family, and so on. But for those who can look at the world with truly open eyes, and be ready to be let in behind the closed doors of the neighbors, it is a fantastic piece of work."

","The first time I saw this movie, I am not sure how I feel about it.  It seems different from the other movies from the cinematography and story development aspects, but I got the feeling that the movie is written solely to be different.  The story doesn't have a very good flow, it's like forcing pieces of puzzles together.  Sure if you throw in murder, nudity, in-closet homosexuality, adultery, drug, child abuse, dysfunctional family, insanity, masturbation into any one movie, it'll be disturbing (I think that's the director's purpose). So I am not sure what the other movie reviewers were talking about, the overall impression I got from the movie is anything but beautiful.  And the work of the plastic bag literaly gave me goose bumps, that's how lame I think it is.  But Kevin Spacey's role, Lester definitely gives us some laughs and is the only reason to see this movie.<br/><br/>This film isn't terrible, but certainly not brilliant.

It was hard for me to recover from such a masterpiece overflowing with brains and beauty.<br/><br/>Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) finds rebirth after his daughter's jailbait buddy Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) zings his long-buried sexual antennae. Immediately, he starts pumping iron, develops a range of taking-no-more-c**p retorts and drops out of his dronehead job to flip burgers at a local drive-through. Alongisde his frefall are his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening)'s more direct self-destruction and his estranged daughter Jane (Thora Birch)'s own sexual awakening.<br/><br/>The story is plain and simple, but Ball's script is one of the most intelligent, engaging pieces of screen-writing I have seen for an extremely long amount of time. The performances are all perfect, Spacey and Bening got lots of credit, which they rightfully deserve; their performances been strong and powerful, but my personal favourite performance came from Thora Birch. She pulled off a stunning and real performance as the uniquely beautiful daughter Jane. Other stand-outs where Mena Suvari's Angela and Wes Bentley's Ricky.<br/><br/>This movie is so brilliant, that, if you haven't actually seen it, you should be shot.

Sometimes I think, ""Everyone else goes to concerts and buys CDS, and here I am buying movies.  Worthless movies."" Then I come across something like American Beauty, and I realize why I decided to do devote my life to movies.<br/><br/>American Beauty is one of those movies I love.  Much like Fight Club, the movie starts out in our normal, everyday world.  Only in Fight Club, it was the world of apartments and Startbucks, in A.B. it's the suburbs.<br/><br/>And ,like Fight Club, one man has a simple idea to change his life, and then it all goes horribly wrong.<br/><br/>I compare the two movies because I love this kind of plot.

Any movie that takes aim at society is a movie I love.  But this movie does it with style and taste.<br/><br/>This is a movie about sex, drugs, and everything you're not supposed to do. The movie sort of makes fun of middle class families, so if you are a middle class house wife with high morales, then this may not be your movie.  But I liked it.

I refuse to reveal anything about the plot or storyline.  Rather I would suggest...go see the movie yourself, and formulate your own opinion. If you have the will, then you will see the brilliance which moved me to cry, laugh, and think alike.  If you allow things such as religion, stupidity, conventionality, provinciality, or any other dysfunctional malady to interfere...than you will have a corrupt opinion, and we do not want to hear what you have to say.

","I'm a middle aged, middle class, married suburban man with a one child, a daughter and a working wife similar to the family  depicted in the movie. I am truly familiar with the material in this movie. In contrast to others, I didn't like the movie much. It is basically rehash of Ordinary People(1981), Ice Storm and other movies commenting on suburban family lifestyle. By now, we know that this lifestyle  is not without problems. While those older movies broke some ground, American Beauty has many one-dimensional characters, especially the military homophobic neighbor. While the acting is generally good, there is much missing information about these superficial characters. How did the wife get so cold? Does the daughter *really* want the Dad dead? Is the next door boy really dangerously crazy or not? Why has it taken the father so long to react to his situation?  Why does Spacey's middle-aged crisis or epiphany have to involve being rude to everybody? There was also no need for him to be killed in this movie. It served no purpose other than to help the film-makers avoid getting deeper into the character development and plot. Surprisingly, the most interesting character is the teenage rose-petaled girlfriend who eventually shows a vulnerable side. A better movie on this whole topic would be Happiness.

"Buddy-51","Null","0","0","10 November 2000"," sometimes shattering vision of American life
","If you've ever wondered what life was really like in the Ozzie and Harriet household after the cameras stopped rolling, `American Beauty' might well afford you a good indication.  Although this is certainly not the first glimpse into the dark underbelly of modern suburban life - films like `Ordinary People' and `Blue Velvet' long ago shattered any myths about the subject - `American Beauty' is clearly one of the grimmest and least compromising.  Writer Alan Ball and director Sam Mendes paint a disturbing portrait of a family and a neighborhood in serious moral crisis.  They transport us on an often painful journey to a world whose residents lead lives of quiet desperation cozily hidden behind the tranquil faÃ§ade of tree-lined streets, white picket fences and exquisitely manicured lawns and gardens - a neighborhood and, perhaps, even a family not too unlike some of our own.<br/><br/>In his Oscar-winning performance, Kevin Spacey stars as Lester, a 42-year old man suffering a major case of mid-life angst, stuck, like so many other men in his age bracket, in both a dreary, meaningless job and a dreary, meaningless marriage, in his case to a consumer-conscious wife whose personality has long since been drained of the passion and spontaneity that once defined it.  Lester also has an alienated teenage daughter who suffers from feelings of worthlessness and a consequent inability to relate in any positive way to either her parents or the materialistic life they have made for her.  Feeling utterly empty, Lester begins to become infatuated with his daughter's beautiful blonde schoolmate, an obsession that leads to pedophilic fantasies as well as tortured feelings of unrequited passion.<br/><br/>What is remarkable about the film is that Ball and Mendes don't concentrate merely on Lester's problems but manage to weave a full tapestry of suburban despair by shifting their focus to a wide assortment of other characters as well.  Many of the secondary characters, who could easily have slipped over into stereotype or caricature, actually are allowed to breathe and develop in three-dimensional ways.  Thus, we come to understand that, in her own way, Carolyn, Lester's wife, is just as unfulfilled as he is and just as unsure of how to cope with that bewildering situation.  Jane, his daughter, is just a good-hearted kid who craves affection and moral guidance from parents who seem too self-possessed or too emotionally burnt-out to provide her with those needs.  Like so many of today's youth, she suffers from feelings of inadequacy because she doesn't measure up to society's view of ideal physical perfection - her main goal in life is to undergo breast augmentation - and she really only wants to find someone who will love and accept her on a deeper, more spiritual level.  This she finds in the form of Ricky Fitts, her strangely `different' next-door neighbor, a boy who spends his life filming his experiences and whose amazing self-confidence and self-assurance inspire others to label him psychotic and Jane to fall in love with him.  Ricky is, perhaps, the most controversial element of the film because his blatant drug dealing never seems to come under any moral censure by the film's makers.  After all, at least Lester eventually backs off from his planned conquest of Angela, the seeming nymphet, at the last moment.  When he comes to the realization that Angela is really only a sweet, mixed-up kid, he envisions the psychological damage his exploitation of her would inflict - both on her and on himself.   Therefore, before his demise, Lester discovers that he is not quite as morally bankrupt as he has led himself - and us - to believe.   Angela also is revealed as a complex character, a girl so afraid of being `ordinary' that she devises an entirely fictional persona to present to a world that, ironically, really doesn't care about her anyway.  In a way, Angela defines the theme of the film, in that it seems to suggest that there really is no such thing as `ordinary' in terms of human existence and that we all spend our lives in a fruitless attempt to achieve or at least replicate it.  Of the entire cast of characters, Ricky's father, a homophobic, hardnosed ex-Marine, perhaps suffers from the worst case of just such self-denial and emotional repression.   Thus, he becomes the device through which the final tragic outcome is eventually set into motion.<br/><br/>All involved - writer, director, actors, cinematographer Conrad Hall - deserve immense kudos for their moral courage and their technical expertise. Still, one begins to wonder if all these thoroughly dire views of suburban life are really any more true or accurate than the preposterously sunny portrayals of the 1950's.  Isn't it possible that the truth may - as with all aspects of life - lie somewhere in between?  `American Beauty' takes us to a particular place filled with a particular group of people.  As a result, it is safe to say that, while it provides `a' vision of modern suburban life, it is yet to be shown that it provides `the' definitive vision.  Like all great art, it offers only a part of the overall picture - but that part, in this particular case, is profoundly disturbing and truly unforgettable."

Several of the characters are intentionally empty, generic; they speak blankly and in cliches.  And they are all selfish.  Selfish, self-important, perpetually insatiable, and unhappy.  It is ""me-centred"" living that makes them so. Only when characters really begin to care about others, and when others care about them, do they begin to feel happiness again.  The message is presented well, not at all in a schmaltzy manner...all this and they even managed to include a pseudo-happy ending without destroying the point made elsewhere in the movie.<br/><br/>Painful to watch, yes, and yet still one cannot help realising that what he is watching is brilliance.  Brilliant writing and a very interesting directorial interpretation and style.  To witness it is worth the pain, at least once.  Would I watch it again?  Well, not if I were in a very giddy mood, and not if I were in a very depressed mood; this is not a good choice to watch if you are very emotionally charged.

I rented it yesterday and have been kicking myself ever since because I didn't rent it sooner, and when I return to the video store today I will be buying it!! I became a fan of Kevin Spacey after seeing him in ""The Usual Suspects"" as Verbal Kint.  In fact I have enjoyed him in just about everything he has done. But his performance in American Beauty was amazing, ensuring that the character of Lester Burnham, once understood, will not be forgotten for a very long time. Annette Benning, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Ricky Fitts and Mena Suvari all give excellent supporting performances as well. I can't recommend this movie highly enough."

","Every few years a film comes along that both critics and the moviegoing public just fall for completely and rakes in a ton of money...a few years ago it was 'Forrest Gump', now it's 'American Beauty'.<br/><br/>'American Beauty' is art-house light, a film that was unquestionably crafted from the moment the first words of the script were typed to be an 'important' film.  Nothing was left out - you've got your drug use, homosexuality, infidelity, voyeurism - 'American Beauty' has got it all. It goes without saying to really explore each of these things with their relation to the human condition in *one* film would result in the longest movie since 'The Ten Commandments'.  So the makers of 'American Beauty' didn't even bother; its all there on the surface in the name of being provocative.<br/><br/>Now thats only one problem with the film.  And it could be forgiven, assuming the movie was otherwise effective.  Unfortunately, the director of 'American Beauty' found it prudent to juxtapose Kevin Spacey's earnest voiceovers and Thora Birch's adolescent angst with hallucinatory interludes - the rose petals, the name in the lawn on fire.  As the movie progresses these scenes slowly sap whatever feeling of reality the film had to the point where it loses its punch entirely - to put it bluntly, the final scene could have been replaced in whole and replaced with Kevin Spacey waking up a from a dream, and the film wouldn't have missed a beat."

","After over two years of hyped-up, special-effects driven movies, it looks like ""real"" movies are finally making a comaback. The latest addition to the list of quality films comming out lately is ""American Beauty.""<br/><br/>The movie presents us with what seems like the ideal setting for any American: a life in the suburbs with a middle-class nuclear family. But we see that undeaneath the surface, things are not as ideal as they appear. Kevin Spacey is a man working a job he hates with an overbearing, slightly psychotic wife and an angst-ridden teenage daughter. Their new neighbors are an ex-marine, his teenage son who videotapes people and his really passive, unemotional wife. Thrown into the mix is the daughter's nymphomaniac friend who ends up inspiring Spacey to change his life, in a number of rash, illogical and not so wholesome ways.<br/><br/>Over the course of the movie, we see that there's more to each and every single one of these people than meets the eye. And some of these aspects are more obvious than others. Each one of them has some sort of secret or dark side of their personalities that they try to hide under a facade of ""normality."" None of these people are happy with their lives or themselves, although they try to cover it up as best they can. Their feelings and insecutities continue to build up inside them right up until the film's bittersweet conclusion.<br/><br/>Although none of the characters in the film could be considered likeable, they aren't presented in such a manner that the viewer can't muster up some degree of sympathy for them. All the elements of this film come together. It's very well directed. They acting is top-notch (even if Annette Benning threatens to go a little over the top on occasion), the script and dialogue are of top quality and the score is really good. My only complaint about the film is the opening line where Kevin Spacy says ""Within a year, I'll be dead."" This gives away stuff that the audience would rather not know and slightly lessens the impact of the film.<br/><br/>""American Beauty"" is the best movie I've seen this year so far and I certainly do not hesitate to recommend it. The somewhat downbeat nature of this film may keep it from getting nominated by the Academy Awards, but I really hope it will."

But as i was watching it, i realized that it is really a very good movie. It gives us a very good picture of many families, and probably our own (obviously not in every way, but in many ways).<br/><br/>One of the funny things about this movie is that, unlike most of the other movies (the good ones, the ones with quality), this one doesn't embrace you. I saw this movie but i wasn't touched, i didn't started thinking deeply. This is a movie that you see and then you can say: 'Yeah, it's funny. It's a good movie...' and get on with it. It's not like you start thinking about human values or morale, because this isn't about that. It's just about a family. Nothing more. Nothing less.<br/><br/>The director has made a very good job, the movie is well structured, i think that Sam Mendes couldn't have a better start in the cinema career. He has made a fantastic job. The actors are also amazing, you really get to like to watch them.<br/><br/>But the story (a good story) can't be considered a great story. A great story is a story that makes you question your own values, and the only thing that this movie might tell you is that you should think about the way your life is going. I'm not saying that that's a bad message, i'm saying that there are better stories (far better) that didn't had the luck to have such a good director and such a good production.<br/><br/>Not one of the ten best movies i've seen.<br/><br/>Overall 8/10"

First I thought the movie would focus on the beautiful Angela Hayes and how Lester Burnham would fall totally in love with her and her body, and then I thought the movie would focus on the shy neighbor (played by Wes Bentley)trying to impress Jane Burnham, who was beautifully played by Thora Birch. Then I found this movie focused on almost every single character's relationship with each other, all of them being stereotypes. And that's also what I love about this movie. It gives a true impression of how American families are. You have the rebellious teenage daughter, the hot chick who brags about all the guys she's slept with and who everyone falls for, the mother who thinks the world's only about her and ""treats her daughter like an employee and husband like he's invisible"", the neighbor 18 year old boy who's obsessed with the neighbor daughter, he can see the beautiful in everything; his father, a pompous, overproud (?) Colonel of the United States Marine Corps who beats his son and doesn't care about the dimwitted wife (well, he does a little...not much), and last but not least there's Lester Burnham. Kevin Spacey is just an incredible actor. The way he talks, moves, and breathes, I am glad he won an Oscar. This movie is funny and depressing at the same time.

Their daughter, Thora Birch, is going thru teen angst, while being pursued by the strange new neighbor's son (Wes Bentley).<br/><br/>For a modern suburban black comedy to work, you have to go all the way (""Serial Mom""), or it has to be really focused (""To Die For"").  Trouble here is there are too many subplots.  Make no mistake, this is a very funny film. But the film's ending just emphasizes how the film makers were torn between death and laughter.<br/><br/>One of the biggest sub plot errors was to introduce new neighbors for Spacey and Bening.  The neighbor's son will play a pivotal role, as well as the father, played by Chris Cooper (who seems destined to play a father of teen boys as in ""October Sky"").  But by making Cooper a stereotypical Marine colonel, and not giving him any time for character development, it makes the film's dramatic climax seem out of place.<br/><br/>Reason I rated the film as high as I did is due to Bening's over-the-top acting, and Spacey's most complete role to date.  8/10"

","the reasons for watching this movie are innumerable. i can see a time where it will be a standard in any american pop culture course offered, not merely in the land, but anywhere in the world. not only do we get to witness kevin spacey's emergence into an assured maturity and stature as a classic american actor in the ranks of gregory peck, william holden, dustin hoffman, and martin sheen, but we also get to witness the proof that warren beatty's wife is actually an actress worthy of our attention. regardless of where you may have seen her before, this is the movie where there is simply no room to doubt her commitment to the actor's craft. annette benning seemed to me, before this movie, to be something contrived, almost pathetically dependent on the aesthetic pleasance of her name to garner notice. even her marriage to one of hollywood's legendary playboys seemed a contrivance intended to attract public notice. the irony is that all of these suspicions could still prove true, and yet, by virtue of her performance in  american beauty, there can be no doubt about her ability as an actress. and if all of that weren't enough, there is thora birch. at eighteen years old, she has a presence that any actor would envy. in a movie that clearly and deliberately steps outside of the staid hollywood format, and in the company of actors with substantially established laurels, her work is almost shocking in consideration of her age. rather than analyze the plot, which effort could be the an adequate doctoral thesis, i believe it is enough to say that, judging by the result, everyone involved in the making of this movie must have delivered all the goods they had. american beauty lives up to its name."

Being dark can contribute to a movie sometimes, but not here. Imagine a dark ""Married...with children"" and it being more of a drama than a sitcom. The family is becoming dysfunctional with the father going after his American dream and developing a sexual interest in one of his daughter's friends, with the daughter doing the same with the boy next door, much to the chagrin of the boy's homophobic father.

","AMERICAN BEAUTY<br/><br/>Â…and context plays a huge part in what is defined good or great.  Yes: as regards the mainstream studio system, AMERICAN BEAUTY is an earth-shattering revelation. However, after all the excess praise lauded on its shoulders, hindsight suggests the film is far from perfect.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey is always great, but in jaded pawn Lester Burnham he delivers his finest performance to date. At first he appears to be an impotent protagonist, but by the end of the film, he has made a complete journey from one unfulfilling life to the dawn of another, liberated existence. Unfortunately this journey is hindered by Sam Mendes' kid-gloves direction. He devotes so much screen time to underdeveloped, super-simplistic caricatures and this detracts from the impact of the film.<br/><br/>Good actors deliver stereotype roles with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, such as Chris Carter (the explicitly evil homophobe drill sergeant) or Peter Gallagher (a sleazy salesman). The opportunity to make a sincere statement about small-town homophobia is squandered with a resolution straight out of a Benny Hill sketch. Mendes and writer Alan Ball seem desperate to wrap the viewer in cotton wool, from the revealing opening (not necessarily a bad thing) to the contrived end. <br/><br/>Thankfully, the flaws of plot mechanics are overcome by a great lead performance. It doesn't say as much about suburban discontent as HAPPINESS, or have the same force as the far-superior FIGHT CLUB, but AMERICAN BEAUTY is a challenging example of its own kind, accommodating mainstream fare.<br/><br/>
I agree with the user comment about the film being life affirming, not nihilistic. It is just a shame I found it a little too manipulative, dishonest even. But it would be nice to see more films like this in the multiplex. Unfortunately, twelve months down the track it doesn't seem the studios have taken up the challenge."

Not only is American Beauty one of my favourite films of 1999, I can honestly say that it is now one of my favourite films of all time. Once in a while, a movie comes along that leaves you looking at life from a different perspective. American Beauty is one such film.<br/><br/>Excellent direction by Sam Mendes, inventive and hilarious script by Alan Ball, and Conrad Hall offers us a visually stunning piece of cinematic history. The performances are OUTSTANDING: Kevin Spacey once again shows us what a profound, complex talent he is in his portrayal of ""everyman"" Lester Burnham, Annette Bening is spectacularly neurotic and frightening as Carolyn Burnham. The bright, young actors in this film, Mena Suvari, Thora Birch and Wes Bentley offer superb depictions of teenagers with substance (a character trait which is lacking from most teenage roles these days).

"bwolf","Null","0","0","30 August 2000"," A Character Analysis
","This magnificent film should be interpreted for what it is, a character analysis.  My interpretation reveals the use of character foils as the essence of this movie, as the raison d'etre, if you will.  The most obvious foils are Lester and the Colonel, Carolyn and Mrs. Colonel, and Jane and Angela.  Lester rebels against his surroundings, forging a new life, searching for his lost youth, using the accoutrements of his youth, be them cliched, of the young cheerleader, marijuana, and a job in a burger joint. The Colonel is the standard of discipline, unable to express his own inner desire, his repressed homosexuality, and when he does, he becomes so embarrassed that he acts violently against the man who rejected him. Carolyn, the success-driven, high powered wife, is terribly unhappy, and is forced to superficiality and facade to cope with her Type A behavior. Mrs. Fitts has no job, no passion, no energy.  She is completely lost to the world, in a stunning contrast with Carolyn's penetrating energy and surging emotions.  Jane and Angela provide an interestingn dichotomy:  both are obviously without self-assurance or self-esteem, but they manifest it quite differently.  Jane remains quiet and removed, seeking breast augmentation that she quite obviously does not need, while Angela becomes aggressive, fabricating stories and putting down her friend in order to build a false self-esteem.  I would also put forth another interesting foil in the movie, that of the roses with the flying garbage sack.  One is the traditional American beauty, while the other is a marvel of a boy's eyes, something unseen by most, but captured by him alone.  How amazing to see a roomful of movie goes watching a garbage sack dance and become moved by it!  The only person without a foil is Ricky, whose originality is meant to stand out as a Christ-like, messaianic figure, in an interesting anti-thetical fashion. He offers youth to Lester and love to Jane, saving both from their respected past lives. The complexity of this movie is too much to discuss in a thousand words, or else I should talk more extensively about the meaning of each character, and how the film maker succeeded in making each character special to some characters and awful to others.  Angela for instance, is indeed ordinary in Ricky's eyes, but to Lester, she is the picture of perfection, this depsite the fact that Ricky and Lester have become great friends.  Jane is ugly to Angela, but ""interesting"" to Ricky; Ricky an outcast at school, a bad son to his father, yet the savior to others; Lester a boring husband, bad father, and poor employee, yet, we, the audience, grow to love him.  Even Carolyn finds someone to show her affection, despite her superficiality. Movies that can stand the test of time and be deemed ""Great"" by generation after generation make themselves such by their innate complexity.  Such movies become better with each viewing, rather than growing stale and predictable.  American Beauty, by its complexity (yes, some of the characters are a bit stereotypish, but round, not flat ones) will, by the end of my life time, will be remembered as the last great movie of the twentieth century."

","No film has ever entertained, enlightened and had such a profound effect on me as Sam Mendes' directorial debut, American Beauty.  The film tells the story of one man's rebellion against the social conventions that he has fallen victim to.  It is also the story of the way his change effects the people around him, and the way that everyone slowly begins to be truer about themselves.  This is one of the most genuine films, it is not afraid to show people at their truest, hiding behind masks to cover who they really are. In my opinion, films have a responsibility to do three things: entertain, enlighten and display great use of cinema.  American Beauty entertains on every viewing, from the comedic elements that stand out as you watch for a first time, to the amazing depth that is revealed on every repeated viewing. Mendes' direction also stands out as a brilliant achievement which rivals the best works of Welles and Bergman.  His visual style is both haunting and mesmerizing, and he develops a subtle pattern of character revelation. Whenever we see characters being their true selves, it is almost always through a window, a mirror or a hand-held camera.  The acting is perhaps the finest work I have seen on film.  Kevin Spacey gives a stellar performance, combining the obvious physical transformation he undergos with the subtle changes in his personality.  Wes Bentley plays the character who knows the truest nature of beauty.  His character Ricky is the film's real hero. Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari and Chris Cooper all succeed in creating apparently caricatured people who reveal subtle and sympathetic reasons for their actions.  This is a film which has reminded me that most people who appear bad are only cowering behind their true selves, they have reasons for their actions which I can not possibly begin to imagine.  This is also a film which has made me realize that life is too short to waste thinking about money or future plans, it should be lived lovingly in the present.  I have seen many great films in my life: Metropolis, M, Citizen Kane, Rear Window, Psycho, Taxi Driver, Schindler's List, and that's just about 1% of the great movies I have seen.  Yet this one, this treasure that was given to us last year, stands out above the rest.  It is the only film that has affected the way I choose to live my life, indeed, one of the only works of art. I am not a suggestable type, but I realize that life should be lived, not planned for, not worried about, just lived.  We should all look for the beauty around us, even in unconventional places.  Seeing American Beauty, I didn't have to look very far."

","""American Beauty "" is not a movie.  It's a film.  It is literature in picture form. It is a documentation of a point in the progression of our society.  This film is a perfect snapshot of dysfunctional suburbia in the year 1999. (I will admit, Lester black-mailing his boss is not the most realistic thing that's ever happened in a film, but it fits the story if you understand why he's doing it.)  It is a modernization of Marxist-style alienation.  It is anti-materialism.  It is anti-conformity.  It's not a movie based on historical lies like ""Gone With the Wind.""  It's not a movie based on feeling good, like ""Forrest Gump.""   It's not a movie based on pseudo-mythology, like ""Star Wars.""  (All of those were excellent films, but ultra-unrealistic.) ""American Beauty"" is based on the dark side of your own friends and neighbors.  The characters in it are not good people.  They don't ""save the day"" in the end.  They live trapped in a prison of their own making.  They spend most of the time making each other miserable.  To say that ""American Beauty"" is depressing misses the point.  The film works because it is emotionally powerful.  The only moral is that life is short, and to be grateful that you're alive."

Number two, is the fact that it shows how a generation of kids refuse to accept all the things they have.  It also shows how our parents refuse to be a part of our lives unless they want to. It shows how we live in a culture that puts too much emphasis on the possessions we own. It was very uplifting to know that there are people out there who don't need to have the most expensive car, or a mink coat, or the nicest jewelry. Spacey himself says, ""It's just a couch! This isn't life, this is just stuff.  And it's become more important to you than living."" It shows how we, as a society, come to accept the world around us.

","The reason why people loved this movie is probably that it conveys the image of revolution everyone dreams to lead : the revolution against the social laws. According to me, this idea is far from being new. I agree with the painting of the American Society (and actually of many western societies), that Annette Benning embodies. Her character is very well described : the woman may be willing to free herself from the social laws, but not able to do so, because no one has ever told her how to do. While her husband is able to follow his feelings, she cannot free her mind of some material concerns like money and image. Her character is actually the best part of the film.<br/><br/>About Lester, I would say that his character is not so true. The whole movie suddenly crashes down when he tells the girl that he is happy. This happiness isn't well described in the movie : is it made of music heard in a car, and of marijuana smoked with the neighbour ? This seems a bit fake. He doesn't have any relationship with anybody. He is lonely, or at least the movie doesn't give us any clue about him having friends. The whole movie is supposed to criticize the American society and to explain how to escape. Only the criticism is good, thanks to Mrs. Burnham and Annette Benning. The movie is based on Lester Burnham and Kevin Spacey, and I think it is in fact its weakness."

","It's impossible to know what, in 20 years, 50 years or 100 years, will be a classic. Sometimes, art looks deeply profound simply because it works in its time, addresses issues and anxieties of the moment. I don't think this is true of American Beauty.<br/><br/>It's 24 hours since I watched this film and it keeps bubbling up into my mind. There's so much here, it's difficult to get a grip on it all. Very rarely, one comes across a book or a play or a film that rethinks everything from scratch, that redefines the way we think about how we live. Actually, it's hardly ever a film. But this is one that does. It's deeply subversive - it just feels like the beginning of a different world view.<br/><br/>I read the other user reviews before I wrote this and, yes, now I can see some of the cracks in the glaze. But nothing's quite perfect and this is a film which deserves a full 10. Old Fitz might be a stereotype but I didn't notice - the atmosphere of repressed violence in his house was too horribly compelling. As for those people who scored it low - you really have missed something - it is your loss.<br/><br/>American Beauty is sauntering dangerously along the edges of some very dubious territory. It could have become a male mid-life crisis wish fulfilment film, a kind of macho Shirley Valentine or Thelma and Louise (excellent though these are) and it nearly did. It could have been another 'burb film. It could have been a voyeuristic Lolita film. It could have been Happiness. It was none of these.<br/><br/>In particular, it was not Happiness and this opens it immediately to criticism. Whereas Happiness was bleak and ultimately nihilistic, American Beauty is bleak and life affirming. That presents the carpers with a case for the most dreaded charge of all: sentimentality. I contend that you simply can't have optimism without seeming sentimental. So be it. We can take a little sweetness. This is a movie sufficiently complex and ambiguous to support it. At the same time, cinema, especially in America, has never quite shaken off its middlebrow associations, always leaving directors open to easy jibes of pretentiousness. We have such a negative culture that it actually feels clever to pick holes, to criticise where the establishment critics praised. But it's easy to distinguish the pretentious from the true.

","Although I have yet to reach the stage of life that Lester is in, I nevertheless empathized with his character immediately. At the beginning of American Beauty, he is experiencing an awakening to the reality that is his life. His wife and daughter think he's inadequate and he feels useless at his job. But he finally asks himself why things have to be that way, and American Beauty unfolds.<br/><br/>The uncomfortable parts of the film are all slices of American life that should be familiar to just about anyone with eyes and ears, even if they cannot identify with them: the cold, military-style father-son relationship between Ricky and Frank; the suggestive flirtatious relationship between 17-year-old Angela and Lester. <br/><br/>Each character in the microcosm of American Beauty is somehow connected to Lester, and Lester himself warns in the very beginning that he will be dead in less than a year. But with this mix of dysfunctional characters, what is going to happen? A must see."

","This film is, without doubt, one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces ever made!  It's singular troubling element is that various sectors of the American public, divided strictly along age lines, will either love or hate this film for all the 'right' reasons. And therein, lies it's greatness, for truth has many facets<br/><br/>""American Beauty"" tells the story of one American family (the Burnhams) who have achieved the great 'American Dream'; the one that grew from myth to reality at the end of World War Two. This atypical couple have achieved the sprawling suburban home with picture perfect lawn and two car garage (along with expensive vehicles to fill it). The trouble is, all of this material wealth is supported by mentally and physically consuming jobs that each has come to hate in their own way. They have little if any time for family or each other, and have become strangers within their own homes: both to themselves and their offspring.<br/><br/>Then one day, Lester Burnham (played flawlessly by Kevin Spacey) says,- stop the world, I want to get off.  And trust me, you will enjoy the unique manner in which he accomplishes this task. The problem is his spouse, Carolyn Burnham (in a brilliant portrayal by Annette Bening) does not want to get off, and therein lies the heart of the conflict that will ultimately destroy their imperfect union and lead to the death of one.<br/><br/>This film touches quite deftly upon so many of the key elements of the present 'American Social Nightmare'(including latent homosexuality and pedophilia, male menopause, pornography and drug usage -just to name a few), that it is difficult to find fault with it at any stage. How is it possible to argue effectively with the truth?<br/><br/>Look for great acting by all, including newcomer Wes Bentley as Ricky Fitts and veteran actor Chris Cooper as his father, Colonel Frank Fitts.  Nor should one overlook the great teenage ""Lolita"" portrayal by up and coming actress Mena Suvari.<br/><br/>Each scene is a snapshot, yet the film flows so evenly that you become more than just an observer - you are there as a participant.  And that, indeed, is the very essence of great film making.  This film well deserves all of the accolades it has received and much more."

The rift between daughter and father is over-done. One could go on  there are too many flaws. It is interesting that this should have gained Academy awards before the infinitely more powerful and disturbing The Sixth Sense.

It was in fact such a cheap plot turn that I assumed they director was trying to make a symbolic point:  no one bucks discipline forever? Self-hatred can be disguised but never completely contained?  None of these seem to apply, leaving us with nothing more than a ""wink, wink, we know what the military is *really* like"" from the presumably PC scriptwriter/director.

","When I finished watching this movie, I sat in silence for awhile, trying to digest what I had just seen.  Every aspect of American Beauty hit home. I think I realized how great a movie it was when I noticed that the actors looked real...they weren't all perfect-looking.  They looked like someone that would live next door to you.  They were in situations that anyone might be facing, like job down-sizing or homophobia.  And, they reacted to these situations in painfully human ways. All I had heard about this movie before watching it was that Kevin Spacey played some guy who was obsessed with his teenage daughter's friend, so naturally, I wasn't expecting the greatest film.  However, the film presents Lester's obsession not as the action of a pervert, but rather, as a search for beauty and peace in his life.(I apologize if I'm spoiling anything...I'm not quite sure what qualifies as a spoiler.)  We all know someone like the Burnham family...picture perfect on the outside, tempestuous and unhappy on the inside.  The whole objective of the film is to point out that what Americans use to beautify their lives(Mercedes SUVs, trophy wives, prestigious jobs, extramarital affairs) only make one want more.  Some people will dismiss this movie as superficial, but I think it's because they make it superficial out of fear that they might be living what the movie tries to discourage.  I will watch American Beauty again because it made me take a second look at my life and my values.  I highly recommend it."

"uscoa","8","0","0","7 August 2000"," Excellent but no where near perfect
","American Beauty ranks as one of the greatest films of the decade and with good reason. It represents a pinnacle of black comedy. Not only has Oscar-winner Spacey been given hilarious lines along with quirky situations, but the film also holds an accurate grasp of human nature and society. It is this that separates American Beauty from similar films like Happiness. The film also contains the best and most vivid motif/symbol I have seen in the color red. Thanks to the crew, the color found its way to the front door and to the clothing along with blood and roses. And the film of the plastic bag is poetry, enforced with an marvelous performance by Wes Bentley.<br/><br/>However, I cringe at the film because of the ultimately irresponsible script by Alan Ball. Ball overstepped himself in trying to force profound meaning into his work. He takes the ""world of beauty"" concept way too far. The speech that supports this concept is read twice, making the second time superfluous. Worst of all is Spacey's final nostalgic speech. He begins by saying that his last second of his life is infinite; which sounds like bar room philosophy in the untried hands of its writer. Then Spacey begins talking about how his grandmother's skin felt like paper -- absolutely inexcusable! That line has no place in any black comedy, Ball is playing with fire. I've seen American Beauty several times and the ending grows more saccharine each time.<br/><br/>Still, this movie is worth watching for it is filled with excellent material. I just hope you're not as critical as I am."

","This film is, in my opinion, a sociological masterpiece. From a European perspective it took me back to my A'- level sociology studies and a certain Wilmot & Young who argued that the working classes aspire to be middle class. As a working class lad' I enjoyed the urine being taken out of the middle-classes for a change. It showed them for what they are. Self-centred and rather superfluous and silly for believing in their own importance, from the sad father and typical' middle-class mother to the selfish `you don't know you are born' daughter. From the faggot hating' ex soldier who has his own skeletons in the cupboard, to the image conscious beauty' and all she stands for. Perhaps though, the video' character is perhaps the most damning indictment of modern society as his strangeness seems, in the end, to be the norm! A superb movie of its genre."

For a fellow Brit (Sam Mendes) to capture the essence of American middle class in such a succinct and, in an obtuse sense, sympathetic way is unique and refreshing.  The script is close to perfect as is the acting, especially Spacey, who makes the viewer unsure as to feel sympathy or disdain for his character.  The use of imagery works throughout the film and draws us deeper into the understanding and meaning of all the themes.  I cannot wait until it's UK release on DVD."

","This is a good movie, but I don't think it was as great as some people said(or insisted?). It looks closely at the 'dirt' underneath what seems like a peaceful and normal situation. The premise of the story is hardly original, a middle-aged man wanting to have a life, but with his trouble family: super bitch wife Carolyn and estranged daughter, Jane, plus his lust for the temptress Angela, things got pretty ugly at the end.<br/><br/>
What amazed me is that, they could make a great film out of this story. 'Beauty' is a extremely dark comedy, with some of the wittiest dialogue I've heard: ""honey, you didn't screw up once!"" still cracks me up! It's really moving, too. Sometimes it can be scary to see the truth going on out there, other times it's just plain pathetic (sex obsessed cheerleader, anyone?) Visually it's a treat, too...who could forget the dancing plastic bag? Or Mena Suvari lying naked in a bed of roses?<br/><br/>I cannot fault a single performance. Spacey and Bening were absolutely 'believable', while the young supporting casts get a well deserved big break for them. Congratulations especially to Thora Birch, who portrayed Jane wonderfully. <br/><br/>This movie deserved it's Oscars, and I think it got enough. Like I said, it's pretty good but not great. It's not for everyone, but worth your money. A quote from Birch: "" I don't know why American audiences responded to it so much. It's such a harsh reflection on themselves."" Now I do agree with that."

The acting from Kevin Spacey was absoultely brillant, as the supressed husband and father who wants to change completely while he hits the mid-life crisis. Annette Bening is pretty good, and should have won an oscar for her role as the wife , who is trying to keep her family as normal and successful as possible. Thora Birch and Mena Suravi play the stereotypical teenagers, but without so much cliches, unlike other movies. Thora plays an outsider in school, an angry and frustated teenager who believes that her family is interfering into her life. Mena on the other hand, plays a popular and sexy teenager who always brags about who she had sex with.

"kdufre00","Null","0","0","3 August 2000"," Every rose has its thorn
","I have seen ""American Beauty"" a total of four times.  The first time I saw it, I was stunned.  But with each additional viewing, I found myself less and less impressed.<br/><br/>This is not to say that ""American Beauty"" is a mediocre movie.  I think it is great, in that it gives viewers plenty to think about in terms of everyday issues like one's identity, suburban ennui, personal responsibility, fantasy and repression.  It also has great performances all around.  Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening are memorable in their roles.  Mena Suvari has a particularly poignant scene with Kevin Spacey within the film's final ten minutes.  And why wasn't Wes Bentley nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar?<br/><br/>My problem with ""American Beauty"" lies with Kevin Spacey's character Lester Burnham and how the movie leads the viewer to believe that he is ""the hero."" I must admit that I found myself rooting for Lester the first time I saw this movie.  But with subsequent viewings I found that there was little to nothing heroic about him.  In fact, I found him repulsive at times.  For example, there's the scene where his daughter (Thora Birch) confronts him about his not-so-subtle fawning for her best friend Angela (Mena Suvari). He quips back, ""You better be careful, Jane.  Or you're going to turn into a real bitch just like your mother!""  If I remember correctly, this line was met with plenty of applause and laughter from the audience.  I actually thought that this was a horrible thing for a father to say to his teenage daughter.  Jane has every right to be angry with him! But the movie leads the audience to be more sympathetic to Lester.  This is only one of several examples of misogyny in ""American Beauty.""<br/><br/>Annette Bening's character, Carolyn, also suffers at the expense of Lester's metamorphosis.  ""American Beauty"" would have benefited greatly had it presented Carolyn in a more sympathetic manner.  While Lester is ""the hero"" of the film, Carolyn is presented as this shrill harpy with very few redeeming qualities.  This film does afford Carolyn some potentially sympathetic moments where the audience feels for her, but they never really come into fruition.  Ultimately, she is more of a cartoon character than she is a real person to whom an audience member can relate.<br/><br/>My final complaint about ""American Beauty"" is that it gives the viewer a little too much to swallow.  Some of it was just too implausible and unlikely for me to completely buy it.  It asks the viewer to accept too much on simple faith.  One thing that jumps to mind is when Ricky Fitts (a terrific Wes Bentley) reveals to Jane that he has $40,000 saved up from all of his drug deals and he asks her to run away with him.  And she accepts. Maybe I am just naive, but I find it very unlikely that an 18-year-old would have that kind of money even if he is a big-time drug dealer.  Not to mention being able to get away with it under the vigilant eyes of a strict father (Chris Cooper).  And I didn't completely buy Ricky and Jane's relationship either.  What would compel her to become romantically involved with someone who obsessively videotapes her in an almost menacing way?<br/><br/>Despite all this quibbling, I do think ""American Beauty"" is a worthwhile film to see.  I thought its boldness was very fresh, for the most part.  It is very watchable, with plenty of characters and scenes to savor.  It also features great cinematography and music.  Just don't be fooled by the heavy accolades it has been getting from critics who treat it as if it's the second coming."

","American Beauty the Sam Mendes triumph has lived up to it's name, as well as all of the hype that is has received. This Black comedy about a man dealing with his family in modern America hits right on. It is humorous in it's utterly ludicrous look at how todays upper middle class really is.<br/><br/>Lester Burnham, a 40 year old advertising burn-out has come to the realization that his life is over. In many ways it is. His wife Carolyn (Oscar Nominee Annette Benning)an over the top real estate agent resents him for everything he does and even what he doesn't do. His daughter Jane going through the typical teen angst period despises her father just for being her father. Even the people at Lesters job consider him just another number.<br/><br/>Just when it seems that Lester has reached his darkest deepest depths of misery, a light appears in the form of cheerleader, supermodel wanna-be Mena Suvari. Her beguiling ways spark an instant obsession in Lester. Causing his imagination to overload.<br/><br/>He finds himself reverting back to a teenage boy of sixteen fumbling over everything from his feet to his tongue when in the presence of this sexually dynamic wonder. Probably the most painful scene for this viewer was at Lesters first meeting of his dream girl. As you sit their watching Lester blather incoherently you literally cringe in misery about how utterly stupid he seems. It's a feeling most viewers can relate to.<br/><br/>""Do you need a ride, I can give you a ride, I have a car.""  This quote says it all. Lesters desperation is actually painful,but so excellently pulled off.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie I watched this poor pathetic man transform in to the type of guy every 40 year old going through his midlife crisis wishes he could be. He gets into incredible shape. He buys the car of his dreams (and not a Corvette thank goodness)And gets his just desserts (to point)in the end.<br/><br/>Also for those of you who have seen this a couple times and want a unique challenge. Watch the backgrounds of the movie, places like peoples desks, signs things like that. The tag line ""Look Closer"" is in strategically placed spots throughout the movie.<br/><br/>I loved this movie and recommend it to any one who is looking for the ideal movie that you just can't get sick of.

Needless to say, 123 minutes later as the last part of the credits rolled up and the screen turned blue I was still staring at the TV, completely enriched within my thoughts and contemplation's of American Beauty, the movie `everyone' was talking about.  I mean, to put it briefly, this is one of the best movies of the 90's, one of the BEST MOVIES EVER!! Just in my humble opinion. Never, since Schindler's List or the original Star Wars has a movie been able to engross me in such a story. I mean WOW!! I have so many positives for this film. Basically the movie focuses on Lester Burnham(Kevin Spacey) who is having kind of a mid-life crisis going on.  Since the movie is narrated from his point of view, we can better understand what he's going through and what his thoughts are.  In the beginning of the movie he comes to the rationalization that he's trapped in a meaningless and depressing marriage. His wife (Annette Bening) shows more admiration in her career and affair with her boss than him and his daughter (Thora Birch) who basically hates them both because...well because she's a teenager.  While attending a basketball half-time show to see his daughter cheerlead, Lester goes into a trance when he catches the eye of his daughter's friend Angela(Mena Suvari). The 42-year-old man immediately falls for this 18? 17? year old girl. That seemed to be the catalyst to Lester's transformation.  He dreams about this girl day and night and for that reason turns into a completely different person.  He stops worrying, and just starts living life to its fullest. His new goal is to get into the pants of his daughter's friend and start acting like he was when he was a teenager.  While his new personality may make him happy, it's making the rest of his family miserable, which builds up to the great climax. This movie just isn't about the life of Lester though; it also digs deep into the emotions of the people living around him and next door, with everything coming together at the end.  This is one of those films that is hard to review, one of those films that you can't really describe in words why you like it, only in words why you dislike it.  Many of my friends didn't like this movie because they couldn't accept  the protagonist as a pedophile.  But the girl isn't exactly a youngin' or anything, and I think the majority of people could relate to Lester's hardships.  This movie has just a little bit of nudity and probably one short sex scene.  I don't see how it can really offend anybody THESE days unless you work for the Christian Science Monitor or something like that.  Or maybe it's just the fact that Scary Movie has given me so much shock value that I've become immune.  Anyway, I recommend this movie for anybody looking for a solid 2 hours of entertainment, with good acting and great cinematography. 10/10"
"Ace-38","10","0","0","29 July 2000"," Scathing painful look at American dysfunctionality
","""American Beauty"" is one of the few films that not only surpasses it's hype, but was truly deserving of the Best Picture Oscar bestowed upon it.<br/><br/>This stunning look at a dysfunctional suburban upper middle class family is often painful, sometimes funny, occasionally perverse, but always biting and very well done.  <br/><br/>Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his career as Lester Burnham, a man who is basically going through a mid-life crisis.  He quits his job, blackmails the supervisor into a staggeringly high severance package and begins to assert himself after years of bowing to his wife's wishes.  One evening while attending his daughter's dance team performance at a basketball game, he catches a glimpse of a friend and team member of his daughter's and immediately decides he has to have her.  This is simply the best performance Mr. Spacey has given to date, and considering the work he's done leading up to this, that's quite a comment.<br/><br/>Annette Bening is Lester's wife Carolyn.  A real-estate agent with an inferiority complex about the competition, Mrs. Burnham reveals her admiration for this competition in a drunken stupor.  She asks him for advice and ends up with more than she may have intended to get.  Possessions matter a great deal to her, and her sex life with Lester is non-existant. Only a great performance from Annette could have been acceptable against Kevin and we certainly got it.  Carolyn is every demographically correct woman I have ever met.  The only word I have for this is perfect.<br/><br/>Thora Birch plays Jane Burnham, Lester and Carolyn's teenage daughter.  Lots of angst in this character as her parents and her have grown apart.  Little or no communication exist between the family members regardless of her pleas for such.  Jane ends up falling for the ""weird"" kid next door, Ricky Fitts (an eerie Wes Bentley) and plans to run away with him.  Good role here, good enough for what was called for. <br/><br/>Mena Suvari chimes in with her best role yet, the temptress Angela Hayes.  A girl who's bark is worse than her bite, Angela relies on her looks and sex appeal to get through life.  Mena brings Angela to life, and is very much the lolita who plays bigger than she is.<br/><br/>Supporting cast is quite strong, with Chris Cooper and Allison Janney leading the way as Col. Frank and Barbara Fitts.  Peter Gallagher is Buddy Kane, Scott Bakula and Sam Robards play ""the Jims"" Olmeyer and Berkely respectively.  This gay couple in the neighborhood is actually more lively than the Fitts' but don't figure as prominantly in the story as they do. <br/><br/>
Director Sam Mendes has created a true masterpiece.  Watch it several times to make sure you catch all the symbolism present in the movie, some as blatant as the rose petals surrounding Angela in Lester's fantasies, or as subtile as the red door on the Burnham's home.  A Best Picture that was as widely received by the public as it was critically acclaimed.<br/><br/>5 out of 5"

","(minor) SPOILERS in this review.<br/><br/>The American Dream which is in fact a nightmare. This movie shows it. A few days ago I watched American Beauty for the second time, and I absolutely LOVED it, even more than the first time. I started the video and never stopped it until the very end of the end credits. That means a lot. From the second the movie zooms in on the street accompanied by the wonderful piano music I'm sucked into it to never let go again. It's one of those very rare movies that doesn't have one boring moment. Such a fantastic movie... very intense atmosphere. And the music is so wonderful and really adds to that atmosphere. Everything is perfect about this movie: the acting for instance. The cast is one of the best ensembles ever. Kevin Spacey, Mena Suvari, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley and Chris Cooper, they're all excellent. Annette Bening too, though she's going over board a couple of times. The movie is also visually stunning, especially combined with the gorgeous music: modest, but its presence is very emphatic anyway. <br/><br/>The dialogue is very sharp and the story tells a lot of hard truths about human behavior (fake marriages for instance). And all in a splendid cynical way. The movie finds a perfect balance between comedy and drama. There's several hilarious scenes and there's lotsa laughs, but there's also scenes that gave me cold chills. The couch scene between Kevin Spacey and Mena Suvari for instance. Suvari's character development is brilliant and she gives the best supporting performance by a female of the year. From a very self-confident, trash-mouthed teenager in the beginning to a fragile, insecure girl in the end who didn't need Spacey as a lover, but as a father figure. Brilliant how that scene switches. Spacey is fantastic, I have to admit. I sure liked him better than the first time I watched it. He carries the movie for an important part (that sarcastic lil smile all the time!), but the rest of the cast is just as good, they just have a smaller part. Fantastic also how Bentley doesn't even glance at the very popular Suvari, but finds the seemingly boring Birch much more interesting. Plus the scene with the plastic bag is wonderful. Beauty indeed can be found in insignificant, small things. <br/><br/>The ending of the movie is also magnificent. The way they gave all the main characters a motive to kill Spacey is brilliant. Though the movie is not about that at all of course. Most of all, the beautiful images, the wonderful music and Spacey's poetic words sent shivers down my spine. Throughout all of the end credits I stayed in my chair still thoroughly enjoying the movie that had just ended. It's hard to stand up when there's so much beauty in a movie. <br/><br/>Grade: 9.5 / 10"

I have a huge movie collection, of about 200 movies, and I watch them all the time. They are all great movies, but very few, if any of them, are on the same level as 'American Beauty.'  Seldom do I find a movie that not only captivates my interest on several levels, but also leaves me motionless in the theater watching the credits in awe when it's done.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his career, and that's saying a lot because he is such a talented actor. He plays the role of Lester Burnham, who lives the ""perfect"" life in  your typical suburb in middle America. But that's so njot true. Spacey calls himself a ""loser,"" and as he takes us through his ""perfect"" life we see what is really beind this sharade of a perfect family. A controlling, obsessive-compulsive wife, and a daughter who hates both her parents.  <br/><br/>Spacey is going through his ""mis-life crisis""..... he quits his job, extorts money from his boss, all the time freeing himslef from this cage in whihc he had been living for years.  He just doesn't care what he says or does anymore. I found myself is awe while watching this movie, thinking to myself ""Please, I don't want that to happen to me. <br/><br/>I rarely find a movie I like more than my favorite (Good Will Hunting). And I rarely find something I'd rather do that watch SportsCenter, but 'American Beauty' is a wonderful movie, and I'm going to see it manymore times. (Yes, it's better than SportsCenter).

","When I saw this movie,I thought  ""Wow! This is one of Hollywood's best dips into realism!"" I loved the grim reality in the novels Crime and Punishment and Madame Bovary, and this movie really hit the spot! The mother in the movie is a latter-day Bovary, caught up in totally selfish desires, oblivious to her family's needs. The protagonist, the father, is also similar; his selfishness is his tragic flaw and, like Bovary, suffers for this. This movie twisted the hokiness of Leave it to Beaver life, ripping off that happy, sappy, Kum-bay-ya, life, and showing what our decade's society has produced. If ever a movie exemplified the greed and corruption of the the 1990s, this movie is its banner. This would be the best movie I've seen--that is--until Roger and Me. That movie rules!"

","(Some things in the review could be considered spoilers, so don't read if you really want to see the movie and haven't, etc.) Many people just automatically discard any movie that's rated R because of the reasons given for this, but I urge you not to do that for American Beauty. Totally deserving of its Best Picture Oscar (and Bening deserved one!), as someone else stated, all the reasons given for the R-rating are crucial to the plot.<br/><br/>It chronicles the life and activities of Lester Burnham from the time the movie starts to the ending, his death. From the opening shots of the anywhere-USA street to the ending scene where the same thing is shown zooming out, this movie has you totally captivated. For a while after I saw it, I wasn't really sure how I felt...then ultimately, it hit me. This movie puts a mirror right into so many American faces, telling them so many things (and many that are going on to themselves right then).<br/><br/>This is something that shows the utter greatness of the film: audiences will grow to love and side with a middle aged, depressed man who fantasizes about young girls and smokes pot. This is just showing you, and oh how so well it does, that not everyone is perfect, and that you really can see the TRUE beauty in things if you just ""look closer.""<br/><br/>Spacey certainly deserved his Oscar for Best Actor; he made the others look like lightweights. Not all dramatic, it had its funny, and even hilarious moments, bringing about the epitome of a blend between drama, comedy, poignancy, and insight. The shining performance of Spacey as the everyday Lester Burnham is almost equaled, if not eclipsed, by Annette Bening's portrayal of Carolyn Burnham, his workaholic real estate wife. Bening is so real as the sugary sweet with a mean streak Carolyn that it reminds me of people I know! I thought Thora Birch's performance was far overlooked as Jane; I'd even go as far as a Best Supporting Actress nomination.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is just so incredible that you can't put it into words. My #2 of the 90's (a close 2nd to 1994's The Madness Of King George), rent it if you haven't seen it.<br/><br/>5/5 Stars."

"Norwejim","Null","0","0","24 July 2000"," Depressing film with one good message.
","SPOILER ALERT >A film well directed and acted by everyone involved. The story line, though, is less than it should be. The death at the end was totally unnecessary. And once again the ""bad guy"" is a government figure, this time a Colonel in the military. Enough already. Hollywood script writers--it is time to lay the blame of our social problems totally where they belong: on us, the everyday people. Stop using government conspirators and convenient right wing villains as scapegoats who are given no personalities and are presented as stick figures. They are not acceptable any more. I certainly don't buy it. But there is one underlying message that comes through clearly enough, and it almost justifies the film. That is, with our obsession with obtaining ""things"". we have lost the real reason we should live: for the genuine concern of others. This is well stated, but gets a bit lost when one thinks of Ricky Fitts' drug dealings being condoned, and of his father, who Ricky at one point said, 'was a good man', being portrayed as a closet homosexual and a murderer. That a movie that portrays hate within families, like this one did, can find any redeeming value whatsoever says something I guess. I rate it good, worth seeing, but could have been so much better."

","Lester Burnham, Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil) and Carolyn Burnham, Annette Bening (The American President) have a terrible relationship, a marriage ""made in hell.""  As a result the family is completely dysfunctional. All the characters have something weird about them. The society they live in is imperfect, they live in a very imperfect world and the imaginative use of all the neuroses make it a great and suspenseful script, an Oscar winner. The actors were nominated for and Spacey won an Oscar.  American Beauty also won  Best Director,  Best Picture, and Best Cinematography Oscars. I say it deserved them. It mirrors society extremely well. Carolyn Burnham represents the materialistic society we live in. She puts more value into her couch than she does to her husband.   I found it interesting that all the furniture and scenes carry a lot of minimalism and simplicity.  There is in contrast much going on with the characters.  An instant classic, Sam Mendes' American Beauty,   to me parallels Robert Redford's Ordinary People.  Outside everything is beautiful and perfect but inside it is viciously ugly,  full of lust and sin. That simplicity and the primary colors such a the red door, made me pay closer attention to the dialogues.  I found the young adult neighbor weird as far as been a peeping Tom, but had a unique sense of  beauty. I recommend this movie!<br/><br/>Favorite Scenes: the blowing autumn leaves, the red petals, the contrasting colors.  The movie is a feast for the eyes. Well deserved best cinematography.

I personally thought that the Green Mile, Sixth Sense and the Matrix were all better movies.  A few people have said things about deep symbolism in this movie.  Well I don't see it.  You know what I see?  A movie poking fun at suburban and middle-aged life, nothing more.  I think people are reading more into it than is really there.  I thought the movie was good, but definitely not great.  I'll file it with Dazed & Confused and other movies that are entertaining but have no real value.<br/><br/>That's another thing, many people have said that this movie impacted them in some way.  But when it was over, I felt nothing.  The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, Good Will Hunting -- I took something to heart when I saw these.  But you can't really take anything away from this movie, or at least I couldn't.<br/><br/>To think that this movie won Best Picture over the Green Mile is an absolute travesty.  Yes, it may just be about some guards who become attached to an amazing inmate, but it's also about the human spirit, and how kindness and goodness can exist in even the most desolate of places.  American Beauty is about a 42 year old man who quits his job, takes up pot and wants to get in the sack with with daughter's best friend.  Must be the first time a pedophile ever won best actor.

I was amazed at its power, imagination, insights, revelations, and beauty.<br/><br/>The title has multiple meanings: the beautiful girl; the recurring theme of roses--cultivation of roses is one of Carolyn's gifts; the cynical idea that ""American beauty"" is plastic and meaningless; the transcendent concepts of the ubiquity of beauty, so magnificent as to be unbearable, beauty of people, beauty of something so simple as a bag floating in the wind, and the beauty of every moment of a stupid little life.<br/><br/>Annette Bening is wonderful. She masterfully reveals the vulnerability and beauty of a character in whom a less expert actress might well portray neither. Kevin Spacey is perfect for the part. All of the characters are portrayed as real believable people, of many dimensions, about whom one cares deeply and whom one can love deeply. The casting, acting, directing, editing, photography, script, and overall concept are excellent.<br/><br/>The most amazing thing of all is how people brilliant enough to create such a masterpiece can fail to comprehend the mendacity, corruption, and blatant immorality (Note: immorality is not to be confused with sexual misbehavior; morality is not to be confused with sexual prudery) prevalent on the U.S. national political scene at the time this movie was made. Some of these people--evidently--have given active support to some of the most corrupt and immoral politicians in U.S. history.<br/><br/>The explanation no doubt lies in a line from the movie: ""Never underestimate the power of denial."""

","when leaving the theater with my brother, he asked me ""what do you think the title 'American Beauty' meant.  like all good movies, my answer required much of thought. i first thought of Kevin Spacy's character.  he was one of the few people in the film that was honest with himself. he recognized that his marriage was a farce.  he realized that he could be confident again.  he saw his potential, and he felt rejuvenated.  self confedence is powerful. next, i thought of Wes Bently's character.  A young man so confident despite his dire situation.  he remained strong in himself, and in addition, help others believe in themselves. I then thought of Annette Benings character.  she played a person that depended on money and her plastic social status.  she represented what is 'ugly' in america. then there is Mina Suvari's character.  even though she gave the appearance of confidence, she was the most vulnerable.  she was completely dishonest with herself. finally, there's The Colonels character.  all the hatred he displayed to others, all the coldness and brutality he showed to his wife and son all came from his own feelings of inadquacy. he hated the fact that he hated himself, and he made all the people that where close to him feel the same pain. when i total it all up, 'American Beauty' meant to me youth and honesty. the lives we live when we are young are magical, anything can happen.  when we grow old and lose sight of what's important is when we lose our grip on life.  money and status mean absoutly nothing, especially when it brings pain instead of happiness.

","I had a teacher (Shirley) who gave me a text about how society was terrible and how we can change it. The world is incredibly beautiful and we can't waste our lives living the way we do. <br/><br/>A few months later I saw that text gain color, images and movements. A wonderful picture, excellent performances and a script never seen before made of `American beauty' one of the most successful movies in 1999 and the 2000 Oscar winner. The great insight was to make a comedy instead of a melodramatic movie. <br/><br/>`American Beauty' can entertain and cause emotion at the same time. The story of a man who realize his life is terrible and try to change it after fall in love with his daughter's friend is fantastic. Some people didn't understand and thought it was vulgar, they didn't know that it's a satire. In a melodramatic movie the reason he would change his life would be different, since it's a comedy that's why he does it. <br/><br/>Some people thought it was merely a critic of the American style of life. It's a critic, but not only to the USA, it's a critic to all the world. In this world everybody is pretending to be something they aren't, like in the movie. Lester pretends he is happy because he has a beautiful family and a good job, but  he isn't. Carolyn pretends she is always successful, it's one of the requisites of her career, she says. Angela pretends she is an experienced woman who has had relationships with boys in her age and now is looking for somebody with experience. Ricky pretends he is a good and innocent son, when he is actually a drug dealer. Jane is kind of authentic, but until she meet Ricky she didn't know what she wanted for real. And that's how the society is, we have to pretend, we have to adapt ourselves to the world forgetting who we really are and what we really want.<br/><br/>
To became a good friend we have to abstain of some of our ideas and desires and always agree with our friend. To became a good professional we have to forget about our ideals and do whatever is necessary to succeed, whether we agree with it or not. Our differences are repressed to make of this world `one united world' with no wars and nobody against the rules of the society. Rules that were made by the ones who have the power and benefits of this rules.<br/><br/>The union of the world can't be done this way. We have to accept all the differences and learn how to live with them. All defects we can easily find in the people around us is also found in ourselves. Everything we think is the truth may not be for other people.<br/><br/>Everyday we pass through all the kinds of natural beauties and we didn't realize that. We are living like robots, with no feelings, no wishes, no wills, no desires. Live like it's the last day of our life doesn't mean we can't make plans to the future, but it makes us think what we would do if an angel appears to us and tell us it is going to be our last day on Earth and we can do anything to spend this day here. We live like this life was eternal, we really want to do something, but we forget about it, `maybe another time', we think, it may not be another time. Lets do it now!<br/><br/>
Everywhere we go seems to be enclosed by imaginary barriers that keep us in the way they traced and there's still people who think we are free. I wanted to became a lawyer but then I realized I would never make real justice, I would just adapted myself to this world. Then I found out that the only way to escape of this whole thing is through the art. A movie like that can open people's mind and together we can try to do something. Funny how many things we can think about just by watching it. And I think each time we see it, we think about other things.<br/><br/>
With all this about the script, seems like the other aspects of the movie aren't so great. Everything about this movie is wonderful. Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch,  Mena Suvary and Wes Bentley are all magnificent. It's a masterpiece of the seventh art. Don't miss it!"

The rage I felt when Ricky endured a few punches was something amazing, but moreover I felt sad for the man who hit him, that he would do such a thing, that he could find no other way.<br/><br/>This American family  comes to realize their idiosyncracies and admit them... which is something so many of us fail to do, it's something to really admire.<br/><br/>I predict many an Academy Award Nomination for this brilliant film, for Kevin Spacey inparticular who made me really want to live out the tag line of the film.

","American Beauty works.  It works so well.  And it's difficult to understand why.<br/><br/>On the surface, one could say it's flawed.  Why does Lester HAVE to die? And why are we told he's going to in the beginning?  Is this to make up for the basic lack of plot?<br/><br/>I'll admit the film is not technically perfect.  It's not.<br/><br/>But nothing is.  And, in a sense, that is exactly what this movie is about.<br/><br/>No character is perfect. None live up to their own expectations. Each has issues, insecurities, demons.  Each feels deep shame.  Each tries to hide these.  We all do.  But by the end, it is their weakness, their idiosyncrasies, and their insecurities that make them more deserving of the love they deny themselves than they would ever be without the vulnerability and imperfection that infiltrates their minds.<br/><br/>Without our insecurities, our quirks, the things that make us ""freaks"", we would be ugly. We wouldn't be softened. We wouldn't empathise.  But the way we are--imperfect, vulnerable, confused, and afraid--we are beautiful.  We are special.  We deserve our place on this beautiful planet as much as the grass, the trees, and yes, the roses.<br/><br/>The film even challenges our negative perceptions of death, assuring us that even in death there is beauty, there is peace, there is rest.  And, if we're spiritual and accepting of not only our own shortcomings but the shortcomings of others, we will, like Lester, maybe even experience something after this life more amazing than we'd ever dreamed of and, as Ricky said, have no reason to be afraid.<br/><br/>I was genuinely touched by this beautiful film that wants so much to challenge, please, and love its audience.<br/><br/>Breathtaking."

Well, pick up a newspaper and read what's going on in America folks!  Look Closer!<br/><br/>This movie, in combination with ""Fight Club"" and abstractly speaking, ""The Matrix"", comments on how American society has stifled itself spiritually and humanely.  To me, three characters represent three aspects of our incredibly dysfunctional system:  Angela (Mena Suvari)- looks-oriented/shallow, Carolyn Burnham (Annette Benning)- overly career-minded and materialistic, Colonel Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper)- ignorant and judgemental.  Isn't it mildly ironic to point out that the remaining three characters (Lester, Jane and Ricky), are, more or less, chastised for being who they are and doing the things they do while all along, they are the ones that have some semblance of humanity?<br/><br/>Americans that feel this movie is beyond comprehension feel so because they, most likely, are embroiled within themselves and their careers and, essentially, the ""bottom line"".

Reading these shallow, reactionary comments from people who clearly don't see past their shopping malls and church rhetoric makes me ill.<br/><br/>It seems that most of you got the first half of the point of the movie -- the immediate ugliness of these characters, whether it be their selfishness, homophobia, foul mouths, groundless insecurities, or power plays.<br/><br/>But it seems to have slipped by you that the point was to reveal, one by one, that behind these facades there exists inner beauty -- Angela's innocence, Col. Fitts' repression and vulnerability, Ricky's depth... and it was through the characters of Lester and Ricky (who, as it was pointed out to me, could symbolize the same person), that we learn to see that we must try to see further than what is on the surface, see past the ugliness -- or superficial beauty -- and realize that the true beauty lies within, even in people who say and do things you find offensive. Even Lester realizes this in the last few minutes of his life -- he didn't need Angela, and her true beauty was the innocence she had been hiding all along.<br/><br/>That this rather obvious device is sailing right over the heads of so many conservatives who are appalled at what they see on the screen, it leaves me wondering if even I can take American Beauty's message to heart and see past this ugly shallowness in these people..."

It shows that life is no happy story where everyone is happy. Actually American Beauty shows that life can be depressing, sad, drug - filled, and tragic.<br/><br/>
This movie centers off the Burnham's, a disfunctional family. Lester (a excellent well deserved Oscar performance by Kevin Spacey) is in mid-life crisis. He is depressed because he might be losing his job, that his wife (Annette Bening) cares more about her job, that his daughter avoids him. Soon he falls for his daughter's best friend and begins to change his life around to make this girl like him. And this obssession soon changes his life and others around him.<br/><br/>This film was very well written and the direction was so well done. Acting performances by Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening were so outstanding in their roles. They were perfect for them and the Oscar wins and nominations were very well deserved. For anyone that hates the film I have to say you missed the point of this film badly. If you hate it because of the drug use, Lester falling for his daughter's friend then you must be looking at life the other way. What happenes in this film actually happenes in life.

","--Includes spelling mistakes<br/><br/>I finaly saw AMERICAN BEAUTY and, well, what can I say it DOES live up to the hype. I can actually understand those who didn't like this movie for once. You simply don't get it. Some say that it's perverted. Wow, you've gotta be a mega-moralist to say something like that. Spacey's fight to live as a 20 year old, and his psychic 40's crisis includes falling in love with 17 year olds. And of course, those who never will understand the beauty of black comedy. It's twisted, and it's supposed to be. This was what the Academy knew when the Oscars were delivered. The thing is, everybody in this movie is, more or less, out of their minds. Spacey (maybe the most healthiest in a way) loose his mind, tired of his o so boring life, numbed off by everything, he let himself loose and smoke weed, works out, works at ""Mr. Smileys"" etc etc... Benning, the wife is a mental case. She's totally confused, cries when a house isn't sold (she's a stockbrocker) and ""stuff is more important than living"". She's a mental case for sure. Almost as confused as... the daughter! The typical teenager. Naive, naive, naive, unsure and confused. But she isn't as confused as her friend. A cheerleader, blonde, superbabe, sexbomb and the person that Spacey falls for. But underneath the classy surface is an unsure, confused, depressed and frightened little girl who's haunted by memories, I'd guess.<br/><br/>
OK. So may the real psychos appear. The house next door. Thank you. First off all: The son. You just can't help but sympathize. He has got a totaly different side of the world, he films everything (dead birds=beauty, you'll understand) even Spacey's unsure daughter, his so called fascination, and his world is a big mix, not to mention he's selling pot, weed, you-name-it. But his father is a marine officer. A very tough guy, obviously too tough. Technicly the most psychic is the marine's wife. A mental case. She's litterary sick. Is that all? Yes, back to the movie:<br/><br/>AMERICAN BEAUTY is simply a modern masterpiece. I was laughing hard at some points, fascinated at others, moved at some points and frightened, very frightened at others. It is simply everything in one and black humor is added. Of course these moralists won't understand how drugs can be funny. Not either how Spacey's fantasies can be entertaining. Well I can. It's age coming in to play, and everybody in his age (or more) should recognize themself. The movie is at the beginning a big mish mash of stories, but they all smoothly are put together at the end, and that ladies and gentlemen is beauty. The directing is not poor. Did anyone notice his teen-fantasies. They were incredible! All the roses gave a numb feeling and it was simply an experience like no other. The acting is 100 % flawless, Kevin Spacey has always been a favorite of mine and this is no exception. Benning is not just as perfect, but great, great, great. I was always thinking that the film-guy was played by Tobie Maguire. All the time! I was convinced. However he looks the same. The plot and screenplay was a 10-pointer. I couldn't imagine how the screenwriters could come up with Wes Bentley's dialogue. From the first minute to the last I was on my seat.<br/><br/>Sure, to appriciate it 100% you've got to have no limits in watching movies, but I can tell you. Even if you guys don't like this movie, it IS NOT overrated, it WASN'T poorly directed and it ABSOLUTLY IS NOT child pornography or phedofilism! It is simply the movie of the year! 10/10"

","American Beauty was my pick for the best film of 1999.  Every aspect of film making came together to make this movie great.<br/><br/>The script is darkly funny and is a very biting satire of all of us suburban middle class folks.  In fact, I was a little scared when I could compare the characters to ""normal"" people I knew.<br/><br/>The acting was excellent.  I can't imagine anyone other than Kevin Spacey in the role of Lester Burnham, who goes through a midlife crisis and wreaks havoc with the lives of everyone around him.  The three young stars: Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, and Wes Bentley delivered on target performances.  They add just the right amount emotional depth and pathos to save their characters from becoming the caricatures that they could have.  Chris Cooper is the fascist neighbor, and an underused Allison Janney is his submissive wife.  In a small comical role is Peter Gallagher, providing a foil for Annette Bening, who plays Spacey's wife.  Bening's performance was perhaps the most widely criticize, but I thought it was excellent.  She has been accused of being over the top.  Of course she was over the top.  That was the image of success her character was trying to project constantly, but when she stops projecting that image, we see a human side that is very touching in the film's final sequence.<br/><br/>The film has a good message about what beauty is, and Spacey's closing monologue brings everything to a close wonderfully.  If the inevitable had come a half an hour earlier, it would seem less tragic, but that extra time gives the audience a chance to ""look closer"" and empathize with each character, even Chris Cooper's.<br/><br/>Also of note, is the beautiful cinematography.  The use of color is striking, especially in the surreal dream sequences.  This film definitely deserved the oscar it received for cinematography, as well as the other four oscars.<br/><br/>So, if you want to see what everyone has been talking about, you should see American Beauty.  **** out of ****"

","I finally got around to seeing this, and, while it wasn't a bad movie, and the acting was strong, I can't believe it was so overwhelmingly adored when a vastly superior film in the same vein, The Ice Storm, was all but ignored just recently. The Ice Storm touched on very similar themes in far more subtle and rich ways, and didn't rely on the cheap ""shot"" in the end for its devastating effect. The lost, bewildered father, Kevin Kline in the Ice Storm, is left alive to face life and hopefully resurrect his family rather than ascending to omniscient bliss on the wings of his own self-centeredness. Maybe I'm just holding this movie to a higher standard because of all of the awards and hype--it had its moments.  But the Annette Benning character didn't do a thing, Kevin Spacey's character displayed every single self-referential, moral relativist trait that makes the baby boomers like a plague of locusts on this nation, and the bit about videoing the dead bird and the paper bag, may seem hip to many moviegoers but is merely regurgitated 1980s art school trickery. The one thing I really liked about American Beauty was the handling of the gay marine next door--it was incredibly touching when he came into Kevin Spacey's garage and then disappeared again into the rain--it was also incredibly satisfying to see this stereotype, the hardass, homophobic marine blown apart once and for all--fag-hating marines will never be able to show their faces again in the neighborhood after this treatment sinks into the country's consciousness."

His obsession with Angela may boost his confidence...a little...yet fate is still after him!<br/><br/>Well, that's the main plot.  There are a few branches added to the plot. Here they are:<br/><br/> - Carolyn Burnham is miserable with her marriage to Lester and her career as a real estate agent isn't all fun and games anymore.  For pleasure and happiness, she turns to her bussiness rival, Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher), and starts to have an affair with him, which suddenly turns not only her marriage, but her own life upside down!<br/><br/> - Jane Burnham is suffering from the oddest problems a typical, all American teenage girl could ever have:   Her parents hate each other, her father is obsessing over her friend (and not to mention, Angela, herself, is willing to return the pleasure to Jane's dad), and the new boy next door, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bently) has developed a major crush on Jane.  Ironically, Ricky and Lester have formed a friendship, which makes Ricky's homophobic father (Chris Cooper) believe that they are ""more than friends"".  Ricky has it tough in life...his father rules the house with an iron fist and often takes his anger out on his son.  As misery full fills Ricky's life, Jane's feelings for Ricky changes from hate to love.<br/><br/>Okay, those are the plots to this story.  Tempting...isn't it?  Well, I must say, I thought this was an excellent film for good laughs, but is also filled with surprises!  Although it's not the best movie I ever saw in my life...it is a movie that was worth renting!!!  And for those who haven't seen it and want to see...it's definately worth it!!!  With unforgettable performances by Kevin Spacey, Annette Benning, Thora Birch, Wes Bently, and Mena Suvari, ""American Beauty"" is an unforgettable, intense film that will make you not want to move an inch away from your seat and soon become an instant classic!!!"

","Here, we have a typical case of the music dominating the actual story line. Thomas Newman is a wonderful composer. Anyone who has seen Shawshank Redemption will recognize the haunting and beautiful sounds interwoven throughout the fabric of American Beauty. At times Newman's music is really the only thing holding this film together.  Musically another strong moment is Lester running out of his house while The Who's ""The Seeker"" blares.  I love The Who, and any movie containing a rarely played Who powerhouse tune has to get some kudos.  Other than that the movie is mediocre.  It's okay as a comedy of sorts, but there's not a whole lot going on here.  The big message is be thankful for every moment of your life.  Okay, thanks, got it. Best film of the year?  I don't think so.  Best Actor? Sorry Kevin. Actually I think the kid from Sixth Sense should have won best actor.  He really did have a leading role, but they never nominate a kid lead for best actor.  Remember Christian Bale in Empire of the Sun? Didn't get nominated for a thing, and he was absolutely brilliant.  But I digress.  American Beauty will not go down in history as one of the greatest movies ever. I doubt it will be remembered as anything special five years from now.  In short, mediocre.  Good music, though."

Director Mendes tries to make it all seem very very (very) important, but it's still just a melodrama. At its best it's a version of the Hemingway short story ""The Short, Happy Life of Francis Macomber""; at its worst, it's an episode of any soap opera. I can't understand how the screenplay won an award - wait, yes I can.<br/><br/>God, but the whole thing is so aware of its own importance (""what you're watching is CINEMA, you stupid viewer""); it's so self-aggrandizing it makes me want to puke. I wish it didn't have this attitude because Kevin Spacey is as good as he's ever been and Annette Bening is acting her butt off. I wish a lot of things - like this film should have had the guts to admit the story was really about Ricky, the more interesting storyline; like it should have spent a little less time on the superfluous dream sequences, and a little more time on the development of the abundance of two-dimensional characters; and I wish we would have been able to see the REAL reason Lester had ""changed"" - it's not because of cheerleaders - and somewhere, someone involved with this film knows it. But has yet to let us in on it.<br/><br/>If you've read this far, you may be surprised to learn that I gave this movie an 8.

But we'll wait and see. A film that came out the same year and adressed similar issues but in an entirely different way was Paul Thomas Anderson's truly mindblowing ""Magnolia"".

","When I first heard about this movie, I read about it in Entertainment Weekly and it sounded really interesting, but I didn't realize that it would be as good as it was.  Everything about the movie fit so well with everything else in the movie.  No scene seemed just thrown in to extend time or add some nudity.  The nudity that was in this movie really fit the movie (unlike other movies like He Got Game and The Thomas Crown Affair).  The dialogue was excellent and every actor stayed in character the whole time.  I must say that I am not really a fan of Annette Benning (She's good, but there are better actresses), but I see Oscar contention for her.  Kevin Spacey was also excellent and he could also get an Oscar.  I must say though that it was the ""kids"" that most impressed me.  Thora Birch was fantastic in this movie and it is good to see that she has outgrown stuff like Now and Then and Hocus Pocus.  Mena Suvari was fabulous in this movie (She was one of the few really good characters in American Pie along with Alison Hanningan).  I was, however, most impressed with Wes Bentley who came out of nowhere to be such a great actor.  I really believed him to be Ricky Fitts.<br/><br/>As soon as the camera was flying above the street at the beginning of the movie, I was convinced that it was going to be a great movie.  It reminded me a lot of The Ice Storm, which is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Even the music sounded very much like it would have been in the Ice Storm (with the exception of ""American Woman"").<br/><br/>I must say that in a year with such high movie grosses, no movie has jumped out at me as being in contention for an Oscar and while I doubt this one will win Best Picture, I do hope that at least one of the talented actors receives an award for their performance because they were really that good.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1-10, I give this movie a very high 9."

In his story, taking place in present-day suburban America (no location given), he goes through many obstacles with his family and friends.

Kevin Spacey played a character who, supposedly, found himself and shucked off all the social crap holding him down.  I guess I saw that whole theme as the rather adolescent.  He could work at a minimum wage job and not have any worries about money and drive his cool fast Firebird. Who doesn't want to return to the carefree days of being a teenager where clean clothes appeared in your drawers and meals were placed before you in a spotless tastefully decorated single home where you hung out in your room and got high listening to music.  I've worked at minimum wage jobs and lived in the hovels you could afford on that salary.  It is not as portrayed in this movie.

","This is a movie about people. People whom you might see in the subway, people who might have sold you your house, and kids with whom your kids go (or will go) to school.<br/><br/>Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey, THE MAN,) is a  loser (by the characters own admission) rebelling against his dreary, bang-on-a-brick-wall-and-make-your-bosses-rich job, who suddenly snaps and finds his utopia in a mixture of release from responsibility, and living for the moment. Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening), his wife, was once a fun loving, happy woman. That is, if fun and happiness can be described as running up to the rooftops and flashing the traffic helicopters. She is now caught up in an unsatisfactory marriage, and her ""stuff"". Jane Burnham (Thora Birch), their daughter thinks her father is a lame excuse for one, and her dissatisfaction rises to disgust when she finds out that he has a crush on her classmate.<br/><br/>This movie is built around our man Lester, and the story is a narration by him, announcing in the very beginning that he will soon be dead. So the narrator is a dead man. Talk about retrospective narration.<br/><br/>Throw in a guy next door, dealing in genetically engineered mind altering substances, and spending his spare time video taping 'beauty' (see the film, you'll see what i mean) as a love interest for the daughter Jane.<br/><br/>Also factor in this guy's dad - an ex armyman - with a desire for ""structure and discipline"", with strong homophobic tendencies. To that add a nice finishing touch of the seemingly ""perfect"" girl from school -Angela (Meena Suvari), and you have enough characters to make 5 movies in the least.<br/><br/>The trick here is getting all of them into one. This movie does a fantastic job. Each character is so vivid  in it's black and whites and greys. Those beautiful beautiful greys...<br/><br/>But maybe this movie is not about people. Maybe it's about the ""American Dream"". Maybe it's about the ""American Family"". Maybe it's about these two ""American Things"", and how the different characters try to get at them.<br/><br/>But again, maybe this movie is not about that either! Maybe it is about rebellion. each character rebels in his/her own way.<br/><br/>Maybe it is about none of those things. Maybe it is all those things. Hey it's even a whodunit!  It is definitely about beauty. American Beauty. About how and where each of the characters finds beauty. and by extension, it is a movie made by it's characters. Funny, believable,...characters.<br/><br/>Everybody in this movie gets their characters to jump out at you. It is an acting treat. But, Kevin Spacey rules. No doubt about it. Spacey has this gift. He can say one thing with utmost conviction, while displaying a contrary emotion that the character does not yet fully understand. And he does this in a way  that you understand the characters confusion. This is something totally brilliant. I've mentioned that Lester snaps. But it's smoother than that. It's not a one scene ""snap"". He *slowly* changes into this different person. the character he plays is pathetically comic, and profoundly tragic, and Spacey does a great job. Wes Bentley (as Ricky Fitts) does another fantastic job. He plays a complex character that takes in his surroundings and takes a good look at them. He is what he wants you to see him to be. He is at the same time eerily fragile, and confidently magnetic. I'm definitely going to keeping my eyes open for this guy...<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie for the heart. (Yup.. I know that sounds corny, but the movie is easy to feel yet hard to describe.)<br/><br/>This is the film of the year. It deserved all the Oscars it got. Story, Acting, Depth, Imagery, Comedy, everything is just right.  This movie is just simply amazing. It is far more dark and important than it seems. Go see the movie.

What it does is portray them, making the characters appear tragic, and they and the world they inhabit seem beautiful. While the movie is very sad as a result of its plot, the tone is well-balanced, with brutal scenes juxtaposed with touching or comic scenes. Attention to detail and aesthetic sensibility dominate the production, without causing the makers to lose the spirit of the story, and so American Beauty sidesteps the two most common pitfalls: sloppiness, and dwelling so much on making a great movie that the movie ends up mediocre. Something that sets good movies apart from bad is if while watching, you think of the characters by name. Humphrey Bogart movies do this (who can forget Captain Queeg?), and so does American Beauty, boasting some of the most memorable characters of any film. It is a snapshot of universal human experience (which is frequently seedy) set in suburbia, and anyone who dislikes this movie simply doesn't understand it, or has no appreciation for beauty."

","What else is there to say about this cinematic masterpiece that hasn't already been said by countless others, including IMDb users, critics worldwide and other artists in the film industry?!<br/><br/>Well, I just want everyone out there to know that I feel the same way!<br/><br/>Possibly the finest actor working at the moment, Kevin Spacey makes Lester Burnham one of the most memorable, likeable, endearing and complex characters ever captured on film. I know a lot of people wanted Denzel Washington to win the Oscar for Best Actor this year [I can't speculate, as I didn't see Hurricane], but I was thrilled when Gwyneth Paltrow announced Spacey as the recipient.<br/><br/>The three younger actors in the film are simply amazing. She has been acting since the age of four and appeared in such films as Patriot Games, Hocus Pocus and Now & Then, but this has been the first opportunity for Thora Birch to prove just how incredibly talented she is. As Jane, the Burnhams' miserable and lonely teenage daughter, Birch did a wonderful job.<br/><br/>Mena Suvari gave a star-making performance as Angela Hayes, the star of Lester's ""rose petal fantasies"" and I am sure Wes Bentley's career will soar, too.<br/><br/>Alan Ball's script is delicious - a combination of being funny, sad and dark. And well done to British director Sam Mendes - what a fantastic first movie!<br/><br/>Just ONE little moan (sorry!) - I just think it's a pity that wonderful character actress Allison Janney, who stole scenes as Ellen Barkin's best pal in Drop Dead Gorgeous and as the counsellor in 10 Things I Hate About You, does not have an awful lot to do as Mrs Fitts.<br/><br/>Other than that, American Beauty is a perfect film."

Annette Bening is sometimes overreacting (but, as I think, intentional). Cinematography really good. Best Picture: Magnolia would have deserved better.

Aside from the cheating husbands, cheating wives, child abuse, drug use, black mail, voyerism, foul language, and the malaise the movie casts over suburbia, the movie stands as an insult to anybody who doesn't do these illegal/immoral things.

The symbolism that he sets up with his characters and their situations truly makes one ponder several aspects of life. For those who criticize the movie, allow me to say this in its defense: of COURSE you don't know anyone who would give up a good job for a burger joint, nor would you very often see a middle aged man pursue a young teenager and successfully do so (although that does happen in our society, particularly older men being attracted to younger women). BUT there is symbolism to everything in this movie, from the middle-aged man desiring something that society tells him he can't have, to the negative effects that repressing natural feelings can have on those surrounding you.<br/><br/>American Beauty is an excellent, thought provoking film.

"Khaled Yafi-01","Null","0","0","5 June 2000"," Very Good, Not Exceptional
","American Beauty is a fictional depiction of suburban America with examinations of dysfunctional family ties, drugs, sex, homosexuality, self-identification, and almost everything else that comes to mind.<br/><br/>To say its good in it's presentation of 20th century values and concepts would be an understatement. To say it is one of the most exceptional modern day exposes of real life is exagerrated. American Beauty lies somewhere in between these two adjectives.<br/><br/>Beauty gains points from fluent character development. I appreciate films that can convincingly introduce us to  characters, whose personalities end up developing in a manner that completely runs contrary to our initial perceptions. So many films today strive to play out their characters in ways that the viewer would never have imagined. The idea that the characters are so far from what we think them to be is an idea that everyone seems keen to use. If the idea is conveyed well, the film is likely to be a critical hit. If the end product smells banal, and cliched, the film is likely to be a disaster.<br/><br/>This film has everyday people trying to come to terms with themslves and their desires and dislikes. Director Mendes manages to sidestep the traditional cliches by packing it with insightful dark humour. The film aims to juggle comic elements with disturbing elements; this ensures that the film does not end up suffocating us with it's extremely dark subject matter. Scenes that involve drugs, sex, masturbation, and violence are given extra-special dimension beacuse they are given light touches. Without these touches, the film might have proven unwatchable.<br/><br/>Critic Amir Daftari hated this film because he felt that the twists and contradictions of the film were predictable; the sex bomb is a virgin, the drug dealer is a pure seed, the conservative wife is an adultress....etc. Many have said that this film suffers from it's near-predictable ironic developments. That is to say that the evolution of these people doesn't shock the audience; it ends up being a pretentious effort that fails to hit the target. I disagree with this!! Beauty didn't shock me as much as it did many others but it's cinematic proficiency is undeniable.<br/><br/>The acting here is outstanding; Spacey is particularly excellent because he shrugs off all the normal Spacey stereotyping. He isn't cool, or debonair, or devilish. He's a loser who slowly tries to muster the courage to confront his fears and desires. We can't not love him because he's so human and when he finally acts on his impulses, he makes us all believe in ourselves and the strength of the human spirit. If he can do it, then anyone can!!! He makes us all want to break free and live free and not care about anyone but ourselves!!<br/><br/>The other characters also need to be just as powerful. This film relies heavily on it's characters and their actions. Each persons actions affect the lives and status of the others. In order for this to be realistic and effective the actors must deliver powerhouse performances. They Do!! ""Every action has an equal and positive reaction"". Beauty lives by this law and it is never in fear of disproving it.<br/><br/>Beauty was the best oscar candidate at this years ceremony and deserves it's reward but I reject the idea that it's message is profound like no other film, or that it is th best piece of cinema to have graced our screens in the last 10 years!! It's very Good, Not Exceptional!!"

","""...I hate you, you hate me, we're a dysfunctional fa-mi-ly.."" [my favorite parody of Barney the Dinosaur] accurately describes the angst that permeates within this film. Kevin Spacey, hands-down the Best Dramatic Actor of the 1990's in my humble opinion, portrays the character of Lester Burnham, in the same fashion that he did in THE REF (also starring Dennis Leary) and DEATH OF A SALESMAN (theatre). Spacey brings this middle-aged Rip Van Winkle out of his suburban coma, to re-experience/re-examine that part of him that was lost to the ""coma"". American Beauty is much more than that...many of us can understand, identify and even admire the distinct qualities in the man. As the narrator of his existence within the lives of his family, we see the conflicts and subemotions that have created this situation: Anger, Jealousy, Curiousity, Passion and finally, Fulfillment. But as we all play our parts in the great stage of life, this is an ensemble work....<br/><br/>Annette Benning, the Long-suffering breadwinner, whose betrayals  cost her everything that she has fought to protect; Thora Birch, the self-tormented teenager, whose character-type is a standard in the industry, adds additional dimensions to it;   Mena Suvali, the aptly named American Beauty...and Wes Bentley, brilliant persona within the minds eye....his presence is second only in importance to Kevin Spacey's....there is quite a magnetic quality to his charms, and forthright soul that is both believable and desirable.<br/><br/>Well scripted, superb homespun-tradition modern American settings and locations, excellent direction make American Beauty a MUST SEE.

","American Beauty . . . . . I have been trying to think of something appropriate to say to properly explain the smile that I've had on my face since I saw this film, but words fail me.  If only I could project a video of a plastic bag blowing wild and free in the wind.  Maybe that would be more appropriate.  <br/><br/>Let me get my adulations out of the way, Kevin Spacey does an excellent job of showing the true transformation that Lester goes through.  He shows all the ugly and beautiful sides of his character, and still allows him to remain human enough for us to care about what happens to him - often in spite of ourselves.  Another stellar performance comes from Wes Bentley, as Ricky Fitts, the new boy next door whose performance is rock solid and whose stare is as impermeable as stone.  Bentley gives us a glimpse into a young man whose intense curiosity, offbeat resourcefulness, and deep insights are intoxicating.  On the whole, the entire cast does a wonderful job of bringing this story to life.<br/><br/>My favorite scene (if you haven't already guessed) is when Ricky and Jane (played admirably by Thora Birch) are watching the video of the plastic bag being blown around in the wind.  I don't think I'll ever look at another piece of paper, bag or leaves being blown by the wind again.  The imagery and the poetry evident throughout the film is staggeringly beautiful - all the true romantics at heart should appreciate this.  It's part of what I loved best about the film - the poetry and beauty in all things.<br/><br/>As you can see, I am a great fan of this film.  So, I highly recommend it to those who are not afraid of taking a look at the darker, yet often funny side of life, those who are willing to see the uglier sides of themselves, those who are willing to look closer and find the beauty of truth."

The visual aspects of the film were amazing.  The one thing that disappointed me was the bag floating in the wind, a bag can be very pretty but this one wasn't, but it's the feeling behind it that matters.<br/><br/>
The acting was astounding.  everybody known from reading anything what a fantastic job Kevin and Annette did but I think the younger cast members were just as good.  Thora's silent expressions remind me of Christina Ricci's fabulous  performance in Buffalo '66.  And Wes Bently's Ricky can pull your heart strings like none other, he send chills down my spine with lines like, ""There's so much beauty in the world"" and ""Don't give up on me dad""  Mena Suvari is probably the least talked about in the movie but she was amazing.  She's this girl who can make herself look extreamly beautiful (Bathtub scene) or plane and Ugly (Carrie 2: the rage)   which gives her an edge in playing a pretty girl who wants to be a model yet fears she is ordinary.  Her every nuance is amazing.<br/><br/>
The film can either make you feel something you'd never thought or, or something you forgot long ago,  people who expierence this love the movie and love to tell how it effected them.  Others didn't connect with the film and it is very sad because they hear how it moves people and are left cold and unmoved.  Then they put down the film because they won't feel bitter, cold and left out it the people that loved it simply ""overrated"" the movie.<br/><br/>

","Touted as one of the films of the decade by critics across the USA, directed by acclaimed (and now Oscar winning) theatre director Sam Mendes (who did 'The Blue Room' with Nicole Kidman) and with Oscar-winning cinematographer Conrad Hall ('Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid') on board, 'American Beauty' was always going to be something special.<br/><br/>Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a very bored suburban husband. His job sucks, his wife (Annette Bening) and daughter (Thora Birch) think he's a joke. He is sedated, impotent, powerless to change his joyless life. Then he finds a hero  the weird kid next door. Eighteen-year-old Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) films things with his video camera, deals high-quality dope and lies to his bizarre parents. He has everything Lester wants - most of all, he is free. He inspires Lester to spectacularly quit his job and work at a burger bar instead. He buys a new car, smokes hash, works out and listens to some superb music. He develops a crush on his daughter's best friend (Mena Suvari), who comes to represent all the beauty in the world that he is missing out on. <br/><br/>This film is truly remarkable. Defying classification by genre, it is a drama, a social commentary, a whodunnit thriller, a romance, a philosophical discursion on life, but most of all it is a comedy. The humour ranges from pitch-black to American Pie style, but always produces laughs. Plot twists are thrown up every two minutes  it is incredible how it can pack in so much material, while retaining a tight focus on Lester and his increasing freedom. Breathtaking images of rose petals and white steam contrast sharply with the staid suburban backdrop, showing Lester's innermost thoughts. The writing (by Alan Ball, who deservedly won an Oscar for this) is razor-sharp and, when combined with awe-inspiring performances by every member of the cast (particularly Spacey  this is his best yet, which is saying a great deal), produces some of the most memorable dialogue of the decade.<br/><br/>
As we enter a new Millenium, this is a truly great exploration of modern life. Everyone should see this  it will give you a fresh perspective on movies and quite possible on life as well."

I particularly liked Jane, the ""ugly"" girl who is really the most attractive. This theme of how perception affects ones happiness runs throughout the film.

","American Beauty has many outstanding performances, including, of course, the leads played by Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening. There is also an exceptional characterization by newcomer Wes Bentley, who plays Ricky Fitts, the young drug-dealing philosopher.  And the splendid look of the film is perfectly created by cinematographer Conrad Hall, along with wonderful production design, set creation, and, especially, a special effects crew, responsible for those unforgettable lush, red roses.<br/><br/>But just about everyone would agree with this.  What everyone does not agree with is whether Alan Ball's script is on par with its interpreters.  Much of the material is actually quite derivative. Ordinary People (1980) and Bliss (1985) are direct inspirations, but there are many others as well, including The Red Balloon (source of the floating bag motif) and Sunset Boulevard (source of the dead narrator concept). And there is some claptrap, such as the hackneyed homophobic military character and the trite soul-transformation when Lester (Kevin Spacey) decides not to consummate his lust for Angela (Mena Suvari) after he learns she's a virgin. Spacey's marvelous acting makes it credible, but there was nothing written into his character to account for such a transformation.<br/><br/>In spite of these flaws, there is much to recommend about American Beauty. Directed with freshness and vitality, Sam Mendes and his outstanding cast make you care about the characters and their plight.  Their sensitivity is genuine.  The film reminds us that we need to take the time to smell the roses, or else we will miss that which is truly beautiful."

The changes and emotions Spacey's character(Lester Burnham) goes through in this movie are amazing.(as a matter of fact several of the characters go through changes)Annette Benning(Carolyn Burnham)was excellent as a self indulgent,power hungry real estate agent.Thora Birch played her role to a T as Benning and Spacey's confused teenage daughter(most of her confusion stemming from ""what the hell is wrong with my parents?"")  Mena Suvari was hot as Angela Hayes.(Jane's friend) It was one of the highlights of this movie to watch Spacey drool over her. Newcomer(at least to me) Wes Bently(Ricky Fitts) was my most identifiable character as their neighbor who was infatuated with Jane. (he was the most poetic character in this movie) Chris Cooper played a wicked role as Ricky's nutso nazi father.(Colonel(Kurtz)Fitts) This movie has oscar written all over it, definitely the performance of Spacey's career. Just go and see this movie if you haven't yet. It has such guts and is so balls out,unlike anything I've ever seen before. If you don't understand this movie then you obviously don't understand life.  Hollyweird needs to make more flicks like it. 10 out of 10 all the way."

","I wish people would stop saying this movie is overrated.  It's becoming a tired excuse.  This IS the definitive movie of the 90's because it IS the 90's.American Beauty is sadness- this society is sadness.  Kids shoot other kids, there's rape, terrorism, racism, oppression of all kinds wherever you look.  And American Beauty is one of the greatest mediums i think- it lets us look at what we have become as a society- don't try to deny it, don't try and say you don't masturbate, or fantasize about under aged girls, or smoke pot.  Or have ever done any of those things, ever.  No one is innocent, ever.  i don't care who you are. This movie wasn't made to destroy society- that's already gradually happening.  The fact that the characters are mostly instruments of contempt is completely justified by looking in the newspaper.It was made to make us stop taking OUR lives for granted and try to make something more meaningful out of them, tear away society's cobwebs (i.e. media, false gods) and look at ourselves and think, nothing lasts forever, so maybe we should take notice of all the beauty in the world before it's too late and we're a media-glorified story in the paper.  That message has never so accurately been portrayed in a movie before.  Watch it again, and look closer next time, will you?"

People who rent tend to be demographically older than those who see films in theaters. Looking at the film's voting demographic tells a lot.

They have no legacy. This film points it out and the truth hurts."
"Tresy","6","0","0","25 May 2000"," True and Original
","...Unfortunately, as a critic once noted about the book under his review, the true parts aren't original, and the original parts aren't true.<br/><br/>Let's start with the true parts. As most know by now, American Beauty follows the tragicomic trajectory of an unhappily married middle-aged bourgeois, whose attempt to escape the drabness of middle-class life through a passionate infatuation with another only succeeds in destroying the lives of all involved. Sound familiar? It should: Flaubert dealt with it 150 years ago, in ""Madame Bovary.""<br/><br/>But it's not necessary to go back that far. Critiques of American middle-class culture are about as plentiful as McDonald's in Riverside: take Ginsberg's ""Howl,"" Heller's underappreciated ""Something Happened,"" and almost anything by Updike, Roth, or Cheever, for starters. In film, one doesn't have to look farther than Billy Wilder's ""The Apartment"" (literally, in my case: it's on TV as I type this). Anyone recall ""The Graduate""? """"I have one word for you: plastics"" was pithier and more penetrating about American mass culture than anything in this movie.  ""I've Heard the Mermaids Singing"" mined the theme of the misfit artist well before this, and much more affectingly. The related theme of ""sane"" American society as a lunatic asylum, and the ""lunatics"" as rebellious artists, goes directly back to R. D. Lang, and finds much better realization in that counterculture staple, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" than it does here. (""Beauty""'s subplot deals with the relationship between a next-door neighbor boy, who, we learn, has recently been released from a mental ward.) And let's not even talk about the Freudian cliche of the homophobic military mentality, and its inexorable, violent desublimation.<br/><br/>Even on smaller levels of detail, ""American Beauty"" says very little that hasn't been said before. The dead narrator device was done first, again, by Billy Wilder, this time in ""Sunset Boulevard."" Visually, director Sam Mendes likes to film the family scenes as statically as possible, typically relying on symmetrical compositions and austere interior shots to get across the sterility of Lester Burnham's existence. We've been here before. too--in ""Ordinary People."" (Mary Tyler Moore did Carolyn Burnham better in that film, incidentally, than the competently done, but two-dimensional portrayal given her by Annette Benning in this one.) The level of plagiarism is so thoroughgoing in fact that when the sensitive artist character is shown videotaping a dead bird (because, he explains, it radiates divinity), those who know the history of photography will recognize it as an Edward Weston subject, circa 1954.<br/><br/>In other contexts these kinds of second-hand themes and imagery might be inoffensive, even hip in an allusive, post-modern way. But the one thing that ""American Beauty"" insists upon is the importance of purity of individual artistic vision, as exemplified in the person of Ricky Fitts, the sensitive boy-next-door artist figure, who obsessively videotapes the things that appeal to him. Why, then, does the film rely so shamelessly on the ideas and images of others?<br/><br/>Perhaps the answer is that, when the film does reach for originality, it utterly fails to convince. Partly this is due to a failure of nerve. Unlike the anti-bourgeois, bohemian critiques of the 50s and 60s, whose contempt for middle-class values was unsullied by self-interest, ""American Beauty"" needs those very middle-class filmgoers, desperately. Otherwise, how is the studio going to make back the production costs? Thus, the film shifts the locus of the cultural rot from the ticket-buying, middle-class many, to the well-hated few: the SUV-driving yuppie. Everyone hates yuppies--especially the securely rich, such as Hollywood filmmakers. That's because no one really IS a yuppie--at least, in their own minds. So the film safely critiques a world that no one is likely to recognize that they belong to.<br/><br/>Yet, strangely, the yuppie class signals are still all wrong. We learn in passing that Lester Burnham makes a very unyuppie salary of $60K a year, at virtually the same desk job that Jack Lemmon had in ""The Apartment""; and his wife is an unsuccessful real estate agent. How they support the trappings of an upper-middle class lifestyle is never explained.<br/><br/>The critique of yuppie materialism is also meretricious. When Lester rails at his wife for fetishizing their Italian sofa--screaming, ""It's just a thing, Carolyn! It's...just...a...thing""--one wishes that Carolyn had gone outside to Lester's freshly purchased vintage convertible and keyed the finish, just to put his newfound ""antimaterial values"" to the test. But that would complicate things unduly.<br/><br/>That the film's anti-yuppie pose is just that, is belied by its passing depiction of the neighborhood's openly gay couple. Alone among the film's characters they are depicted unironically as well-adjusted and outgoing--yet they inhabit the same sterile yuppie world as the Burnhams and the Fitts. How is that? One of two conclusions presents itself: either the film is equating the sterility of yuppie life with the sexual sterility of homosexuality (hardly likely, given the film's heavyhanded critique of homophobia), or the film is pulling its punches when it comes to the film's one PC minority. Neither reflects very flatteringly on the film.<br/><br/>The film also tries to extend the metaphor of artist as rebel individualist by making Ricky Fitts not just a dope smoker (a standard trope of any Tom Robbins novel), but a dope dealer, and a highly successful one at that. Show of hands: how many of us pro-inhaling Clinton voters have ever known a virtuous, artistic dope dealer? I didn't think so. Yet Ricky isn't the only one who's virtuous--he seems to have only stolid, trustworthy clients and suppliers as well. Maybe this neighborhood isn't so bad--or so typical--after all?<br/><br/>""American Beauty"" is expertly acted, beautifully filmed, and tightly plotted, with little surprises in all the right places and expensive production values wall to wall. In other words, it's much like the empty yuppie landscape it critiques. And it made scads of money at the box office. That perhaps, is the most telling critique of all."

Yes, the simple pleasures of life are what bring us peace, joy, and contentment, but come on people--there's more to it than a paper bag blowing in the wind or buying your dream car.  While the movie tries to convey to the audience the need of living life to its fullest, it seems to reject the most important need to all of us--each other.  From the start of the film we see the family members diving head first into the depths of despair because of their hatred for one another. They then attempt to reconcile their depression and hopelessness by means that are merely self-serving.  In the end, that could never lead to true happiness.<br/><br/>The film is not a fair portrayal of typical American suburbia, and perhaps that was not its intent.

","""American Beauty"" was without question the best movie of 1999. Five well-deserved Oscars (including Best Picture) went to this brilliant dark comedy about a dysfunctional family and the lives that they live. Kevin Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, a man who is ignored by his wife, and hated by his daughter. Then he starts to have a mid-life crisis when he starts to lust after his teenage daughter's best friend. What Spacey goes through during the course of this movie is something else. Spacey has given lots of great movie performances in movies such as ""A Time to Kill"", ""L.A. Confidential"", and ""The Usual Suspects"" for which we won his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. He very deservedly won his second Oscar (this time for Best Actor) for his performance here, the best of his career. Annette Bening also gives a great Oscar-nominated performance as Carolyn, Lester's real estate agent wife. In addition to Spacey and Bening, there are terrific performances turned in by Thora Birch as their daughter, Jane; Mena Suvari as Jane's best friend Angela; Wes Bentley as Ricky, the new boy-next-door to the Burnhams; Chris Cooper and Allison Janney as Bentley's parents; and Peter Gallagher as Bening's real estate rival who starts to have a little something with Bening. Even former ""Quantum Leap"" actor Scott Bakula has a great bit part in the movie. Director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball made their feature debuts with this film and what a spectacular job they have done their first time out. I can't wait to see what feature films they're going to do next. Beautiful cinematography, terrific production design, and a memorable film score are also major factors in the film. ""American Beauty"" is a movie that is sometimes very funny, and sometimes very sad. It ranks up there with ""Titanic"", ""Forrest Gump"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Driving Miss Daisy"", ""Terms of Endearment"", and ""Kramer Vs. Kramer"" as my favorite movies that went on to win the big Oscar for Best Picture. An outstanding movie.<br/><br/>**** (out of four)"

We may already know the things that the movie teaches us, but the point is not to teach but to affirm what you already suspect, or knew, but the routine of life had made you forget. After watching depressing films such as Blade Runner and Full Metal Jacket, (which of course are still brilliant in their own right), American Beauty is affirmation that life is indeed beautiful, and worth living.<br/><br/>That said, and the movie is also hilarious and Kevin Spacey is possibly the best actor of the decade."

","(some spoilers, be warned)<br/><br/>After having finally watched American Beauty, I have to wonder if there is anything the Hollywood hype machine can't do. They should have awarded Dreamworks publicists a special Academy award for making everybody believe that this bland and cowardly film is a daring and shocking look into American life and deserves the heaps of praise it has received. (The cast deserves most of that praise, though. I hope this is the last time that so much talent is squandered in such a movie.)<br/><br/>I hate to break it to the suburban Americans out there, but guys, there is not really much to see to your life when you look closer. I've read in some of the comments here that some people think this movie is un-American and immoral, but I think most of these ""conservative critics"" are Dreamworks employees trying to fuel some kind of controversy. Absolutely nothing shocking or immoral happens in the movie. For example, Lester spends months fantasizing about Angela and generally having a serious midlife crisis centered around her but he is able to control himself and does not sleep with her because she is a virgin? He even cooks her a meal afterwards and talks about his daughter with her, for God's sake! Hallelujah, he was about to be lost but he is now found! If only he hadn't been killed, he would have become normal again. This is a celebration of some cheap morals, not a peek into the dark side of the human psyche. And just because the ridiculously one-dimensional gay-hater is secretly gay, does it mean that the film deals a blow against suburban American values? It's nothing but a stupid joke on the expense of gay-haters, not deep social commentary. And the fact that he shoots Lester is not ""shocking"", it's just the easy way out. If the guy actually overcame his idiocy and was able to talk to his son, we would have seen some pretty unorthodox resolution to this vaudevillian situation. (I could not believe the scene of the marine dad watching his son and Lester ""get down."" It was worthy of a lame Seinfeld episode, not the Best Picture of the year)<br/><br/>The only message that I got from this movie is: Don't worry that your lives seem to suck, people, there is more to them than you can see, so keep on living the same way and feel good about yourselves. And, by the way, don't worry if you cannot see anything if you ""look closer"", we'll tell you what it is that you cannot see.<br/><br/>In short, this is a mediocre celebration of suburbia and people should be ashamed to have fallen for the hype and made this the #2 movie of all time."

The Godfather is loved by people other than Italians, Boyz in the Hood is enjoyed by people who have never lived in a rough neighborhood like the one portrayed in the movie.  I didn't see the movie in the theaters and after it got all the hype at the Oscars I was thinking it was going to be overrated. My favorite scenes were with the guy with the camera and his dad.  He hated the way his father treated him but he still loved him and he knew exactly what to say to his father to get him under control.  It was also funny how the father would let everyone know he was a Marine.  I was blown away by Denzel in the Hurricane but Spacey did a great job in this movie as well. It was also cool how the guy with the camera never paid any attention to the blonde and how it would only focus on the daughter of Spacey's character. Angela(the blonde) was beautiful on the outside but the way she acted made her ugly and self-centered on the inside. The one character who I can relate to the most is the guy with the camera's Mom.  My mother has battled depression and there are days when she just sits and looks like his mother did.  I would have added a scene where his mother would have had a flashback to show how she use to be; showing that she wasn't always depressed, and how living with a person like her husband can make you lose a part of yourself.

","Beautiful! A fitting comment for ""American Beauty."" Alan Ball created an incredible screen-play, and with the help of first-time director, Sam Mendes, created the best movie I have seen in a long time. ""American Beauty"" forces you to look at the issues present in everyones life no matter how much they think they can avoid them. It takes a deep look at the darker side of our lives as one man recalls the events of his life. Despite all of the issues present in the film, drug use, affairs, homosexuality, blackmail, underage sex, and very strong language, the film was able to capture five Academy Awards including Best Picture, and Best Director for a first-time director. This is a picture that will go down in film history as one of the best. The cinematography, screen-play, score, and performances, was the best I have seen in a very long time. All I can say is that I have to stop and watch a plastic bag blowing in the wind because of this film. It was able to find the beauty of life even in death. There really is so much beauty out there. I urge you to see the film and stop every once in a while and just find the beauty in one moment in time."

","After having read through a whole pile of comments by IMDB users about this film, I can't help but notice that the most badly-argumented, vigorous, total rejections of this film (one can almost call them declarations of hate) comes from people within the United States of America... Why is this? I have my theories.<br/><br/>Somebody wrote about this film that it is not for the masses, and maybe he was right. American Beauty portrays us for what we are: Materialistic, childish, uncontrolled, selfish, intolerant people. But all is not black that we see... The beauty in this film is that every character, no matter what flaws, has their bright side. That makes it such an important document: It rubs our noses right into the fact that the American Dream, although it does exist, is not perfect and neither are the people living it or trying to live it. Albeit not an idea one enjoys being confronted with, it did make me think about who I am, what I do and how I behave towards others. In my book, that already makes it a success.<br/><br/>The movie, although excellent, bothered me in one respect because throughout the film I couldn't help but think that it is a partial rip-off of ""Happiness"", the 1998 movie by Todd Solondz. The story that unfolds in that movie is very similar with the distinction that ""Happiness"" is totally non-judgmental towards any behaviour depicted, which cannot entirely be said for ""American Beauty"".<br/><br/>I invite anyone who has enough character to look in the mirror for a while and be honest to themselves to go get this film and have a long, hard look at it. It's worth every minute. If after that you still want more I would seriously recommend watching ""Happiness"" as well, but don't forget to strap yourself in for that emotional roller-coaster ride... Neither movie is for the feint-hearted or blissfully ignorant.<br/><br/>Either which way, I'll never drive through a drive-in hamburger joint again without a smirk on my face...."

","I sat through two thirds of this film thinking ""sure, Kevin Spacey is fantastic; the story is interesting and the writing clever -- but why do I need to spend two hours with these detestable characters?"" For me, a movie has to have some reason for existing, and if ""American Beauty"" had only showed us that ""beneath the surface of suburban life there's something dark and creepy"" the movie would have been stylish, well-made -- and completely unoriginal. The opening lines spoken by Jane intentionally lead you down that path -- and then the final half-hour to 45 minutes turns everything you thought you knew upside down. Ultimately it's about redemption, which is always a favorite theme of mine in movies.<br/><br/>As the closing credits began to roll, for the first time in my movie-going life I involuntarily spoke. I couldn't help it, the word ""wow"" just popped out before I even knew I was going to say it. For an overly analytical, mentally-rehearse-everything- twenty-times-before-you-say-it-out-loud type like me, that was pretty odd.<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to say something that is not a comment so much about the movie, but about the way some reviewers (on this site and elsewhere) are looking at it. There's this elitist attitude in some people that says ""if the masses can understand it and enjoy it, then it can't be worth anything."" I believe this viewpoint comes from a critic's underlying lack of confidence, his or her need to be superior to the ""great unwashed."" Wake up people -- art was meant to be savored by many people, not merely tasted and then spat out by the cognoscenti. I am not yet sure whether ""American Beauty"" was great art or just a masterful imitation of it -- but it made me want to see the film a second time to find out, which isn't true of very many films these days."

","American Beauty exposes what a marriage (any relationship) can devolve into when it is based upon ""things"" and devoid of love--an arid wasteland to be tolerated instead of ""lived."" But it is also a tribute to the indomitable human spirit--a spirit that wants desperately to break through the shackles & bondage of a vapid relationship and live once again on the wings of passion & reckless abandon! The ""weird"" boy next door (played magnificently by Wes Bentley) symbolizes the wild ""poet"" that lies buried within us all--and the hauntingly beautiful scene captured by the poet (the rambling plastic bag )--is pure poetry in motion--an epiphanic moment for the character as well as the audience--making us all yearn for those days when our bodies--like savages--were alive enough to transmit & feel and run up and down without locks & strictures & rules & regulations & canned advertising slogans. Although I heartily agree that we must break through our platitudes, I am somewhat dismayed that the characters have to resort to drugs (alcohol, marijuana) in order to feel good.

","CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>The acting is very, very good: Annette Bening, in my opinion, in one of her very best performances. Kevin Spacey is not bad either and most of the dialogue is definitely on par. Still, the plot and the way it develops leaves quite a lot of question-marks, especially to the morale of the whole: [Warning - here follows a number of spoilers to the story; don´t read further if you don´t want to be let in on what actually happens and how the film ends!!].<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey´s revolt against the daily routine seems, when you think about it, quite hollow: Is it really such a (meaningful) revolution to quit your boring job and then make a ""fresh start in life"" by taking a job in a hamburger-joint and frenetically doing your best to emulate an idolized teenage-era, basically consisting of smoking a lot of marijuana, while pumping iron in your garage and jogging around the neighbourhood to improve your body? This ""revolution"" seems to me quite shallow and would, in the longer run, probably leave the main character in other kinds of problems than the ones he so earnestly tries to free himself from. In  that sense,  the somewhat stereotyped murder-sequence in the end probably saves the story from this inherent weakness - if the main character dies quite early on, there is no need to worry about the longterm consequences brought about by his new lifestyle. However, it is possible to see the story in a somewhat different light if the ""turning point"" in the end would have given rise to a new direction to the revolt than to teenage-regression. This, however, is never dealt with by the film.<br/><br/>In that sense, I for myself am of the opinion that the darker sides of the ""American middle-class dream"" is dealt with much more sharper and with more coherent lead in the film ""Happiness"" from 1998: Definitely more bite in that one than the, admittedly talented, soft-hamburger-version of American misery given in ""American Beauty""."

","American Beauty is One of the most bold and funny and brilliant film ever made. True/False? You decide.<br/><br/>American Beauty has been hailed by critics as one of the most brilliant film ever made. But by others, it has been judged as a film that breaks all the morality we stand for and praises it. You can choose whichever you like, but no one can deny the film's beauty and brilliance, not in terms of its theme maybe, but in terms of the film itself and how it presented itself.<br/><br/>Alan Ball, I must say, wrote one of the most coordinated screenplay I have ever seen. The film as a whole, is a story of Lester Burnham and his journey to find meaning in life and what is most important. By telling the story of his daughter Jane and their neighbor Ricky, an explanation or a translation comes into place as to what this film is about: Beauty. Ricky Fitts' observance for beauty and life helps the audience know and be connected to what is going on in Lester Burnham's head without so much exposition.<br/><br/>This film was Sam Mendes' directoral debut. Sam Mendes has been known for his work in the theaters. His habit of thinking theater is distictly shown throughout the film with set designs and wide-angle-camera shots that almost makes you think you're watching a play. This seems somewhat very appropriate because of Sam Mendes' style of direction with other things so that it seems to carry out and be coordinated very well.<br/><br/>Conrad Hall Rules. That's all I've got to say. Conrad Hall Rules. Awesome cinematography(again) by the veteran DP Conrad Hall who I think just rules.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bently, Mena Suvari, and Chris Cooper: Amazing. Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening I don't really have to say anything, but I would like to mention Chris Cooper. I personally think this guy deserved an Oscar nomination for his hauntingly real portrayal of the ex-US Marine. Some might disagree with me, but I think that character was supposed to be gay. I took him as a character who went through hell-hole in the Marine Corps because of his own sexuality so he did not want his son to turn up like him and somehow felt anger toward Lester for bringing this about from his son whom he dearly loves. Some might disagree with me, some might not.<br/><br/>Now some might say that the film trashes morality and rules we have, but I tend to disagree. If the film was saying something about that,(IF YOU DID NOT SEE THE FILM YET, STOP READING THIS PARAGRAPH RIGHT NOW!!!)Lester would have taken Angela whether or not it was her first time. In the film, the desire for Angela that Lester has is merely a driving force for him to live again rather than an overarching theme or some sort. The desire for Angela wakes up Lester's desire to live and something that he wants, almost a goal, maybe. This causes Lester to see that he can live again, to ""LOOK CLOSER"" and see the things that are beautiful in the world, that ""It's never too late to get it back,"" as Lester himself said.<br/><br/>**** out of **** is the rating I give, and I hope that everyone can see this film to realize all the beauty that exists in the world and not just see this film as a story of a man who lusted for a high school girl, but a film about life and beauty."

","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is your usual well-behaved 42-year-old dreg of an American dad until he spots his teenaged daughter's girl friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) whose beauty transforms him. Part of the fun of this very funny and enjoyable movie is watching Lester break out of his self-imposed shell and blossom with the rose petals as he tells everybody what he really thinks as though he had nothing to lose.<br/><br/>His daughter Jane is a brooding raven-haired beauty who likes to put on a white-powdered face and red Betty Boop lips to go with her full figure. Thora Birch, who plays Jane, has a face that can mesmerize, and Director Sam Mendes puts her to work mesmerizing us.<br/><br/>Annette Bening, in a comedic tour de force, plays Lester's wife Carolyn, a straitlaced, uptight, worry wart who sells real estate. Next door we have, just moving in, 18-year-old Ricky Fits, played with sly self-assurance by Wes Bentley, the dope-dealing, Bible-suit wearing, photog son of Marine Corps Colonel Frank Fits and his mostly catatonic wife. Two houses down there's Jim and Jim, your smiling yuppie fruit loops and all-around neighborhood sweet guys. They are however an embarrassment to Colonel Fits who is living in the deep, dark corner of a very large denial closet, paranoid to the teeth that his only son has inherited the same shameful desires and will act them out. In an effort to keep Ricky disciplined and on the straight and narrow, the good Colonel practices various forms of child abuse ranging from bare-knuckle beatings to medicated imprisonment.<br/><br/>In other words what we have here is your typical American suburban street. What makes American Beauty a great success is a witty script with a deep and beautiful lesson for our age by Alan Ball, superb direction by Sam Mendes and outstanding performances from just about everybody in the cast. Bening is brilliant with her silly finger gestures and her one foot sideways stance, like a fawn just learning to walk, and her squinty little eyes full of merriment, and that raised and then downward pointing index finger of indignant reproof. Mena Suvari is perhaps no more beautiful than any number of other screen darlings, but she has a litany of sexy expressions and poses that inspire delight. Her portrayal of a fast lane teen siren whose talk is bigger than her experience is just perfect. She might be a budding star.<br/><br/>But more than anything this is an uplifting and satisfying tale of an unappreciated, unloved and mostly ignored man who is inspired to transform his life by the beauty of a girl. For many people (and for most women, I would wager) falling in love at first sight with a teenaged girl just because she is beautiful is shallow and beside the point, inappropriate and not fair. But women love men for their power and their strength and their standing in society. Is that fair to those men who have none? Lester's love for Angela was so great that it transcended carnality, but he didn't know that until he began to take off her clothes and then he realized something very beautiful. He could love her without making love to her. If he took advantage of her youth and inexperience, it would cheapen his love for her and possibly destroy it. Maybe some people in the audience felt he wasn't a real man because he stopped, but I tend to feel the opposite. Not that I think there is anything wrong with making love to 18-year-old girls (on the contrary); but if the girl is incapable of experiencing that love, then perhaps it is better to love her from afar without a sexual expression, even at the risk of disappointing her, especially if you're old enough to be her father, and especially if you really do love her. Notice that in the next scene she is bored and for her the magic of sexuality is gone. He might as well be her father.<br/><br/>So much of what we are presented through the media is a focus on those males who would only be able to express themselves in some sexually-exploitive manner. So much of what we read insists that this is the only way men are. I'm happy to say that American Beauty presents another point of view, and presents it beautifully.<br/><br/>The point made by the surprising ending is that our contemporary 'enlightened' society may recognize the legitimacy of homosexual love, but continues to hypocritically condemn the love of a man for a young girl."

Although new to the big screen Sam Mendes is not new to directing, he is a popular British theater director with credits that include ""Cabaret"" and ""The Blue Room."" It's hard to find anything wrong with the film, and I wasn't looking, but I think they could have done without the Thora Birch nude scene. Since she was only 17 at the time special permission had to be obtained from the California child labor board and her parents had to be on the set during the scene. That is reason enough to have left it out and I'm not sure it was even important to the story's development. Still it is the only gripe I have and it is very minor.<br/><br/>The story is a comedy/drama with dark humor about a middle class family that looks good on the outside but is crumbling on the inside. Lester Burnham (Spacey) is the man that hates his job and is stuck in a loveless relationship with his wife Carolyn (Bening). Jane (Birch) is there teenage daughter that resents both of them and thinks they have gone crazy.

","American beauty was indeed not what I was expecting.  I had the visa charged, and ready for this film, and I am glad that we didn't purchase it - yet.<br/><br/>
Why? Several reasons, and I will be brief, as my 2 cents is only worth what everyone elses 2 cents is worth... and we all deserve to spend it wisely.<br/><br/>
The Main Cast -------------<br/><br/>Annette Benning -- Good casting, great character.  Not a stretch for her though.  American President showed the same skills and abilities, and in a better role.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacy -- I am jaded, and I admit, I love almost everything he does -- but this is his finest 98 minutes. He is able to portray a near mad-man with convincing reality, and passion.  A true master at his craft.<br/><br/>Wes Bentley -- while a relative newcomer to Hollywood, he played the dual world character with a developed style.  Watch for this young man. Expect bigger things.<br/><br/>
The Film ---------<br/><br/>American Beauty tittilates, romanticizes, and nauseates almost every minute. The sordid fantasy, eroticism and hormonal magnitude of Kevin Spaceys affection both intrigued, and sickened -- which is a testament to our society.  When a man can re-invent himself to satisfy carnal needs at the wink of a high school girl, and we can relate? Says something about us.<br/><br/>Benning is the proverbial ""one upping the Jones'"" poster girl.  Admirable, and dispicable at the same time. Her role was a necessary facet, but not overdone to hide the main theme of childhood beauty, and sickening eroticism.<br/><br/>The daughter.  Attractive, self-conscious, and indeed indicitive of our high schools.  The victim of self imposed hyper-criticism - and we have all been there at some point.<br/><br/>American beauty is a great film.  I believe strongly that it should be seen. Would I purchase this movie?  Whether or not I would purchase a film is often the yardstick I use to gauge a film.  Every movie in my collection (over 200) is there for a reason.  Is there a reason for this movie? Indeed - as there was for American History X and the Usual suspects.  Brutal awareness of our society, and those who live within it.<br/><br/>Do I see this movie as an oscar winner?  I don't think so.  It had the right elements.  It gripped.  It turned me to think about myself, the things I do and say, and the double entendre often imposed without any realization. BUT.  It's not the movie for the masses.  Traditionally, every oscar winner I can think of spoke to the masses. They spoke to every American (and Canadian thank-you-very-much).  This film does not.  A large percentage of the population would be horrified to see this film.<br/><br/>In short.. a thumbs up.  But I wouldn't want my Grandmother to see it."

But behind that, there lies a neurotic, self-absorbed woman who is never satisfied with life.  <br/><br/>""American Beauty"" is definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  Although everyone is superb, I think Wes Bentley turns in a magnificent performance.  The part with the plastic bag shows deep and true emotions and feelings, and incredible acting skills.  So I recommend ""American Beauty"" to anyone, not only because of its 5 Oscar wins, but because it truly was the best picture of 1999."

","This the kind of movie that makes you think about life. It has all the elements to make the viewer feel as if he is a part of the whole movie.

I would not call it the greatest film but certainly with the dreamy surreal like qualities it has to go down as one of the more unusual films of our time. Hats off to the director and the entire crew for such a beautiful masterpiece, I cried when it was all over and still ponder the characters as if they were my own.

","American Beauty is one of those movies that could be an independent film but also a studio movie. The director wants you to use your mind and feel with the characters. The story is beautiful, sad and moving. Kevin Spacey really did deserve the oscar for best acting. All the acting is excellent. Definitely see this movie if you have the chance.<br/><br/>A man who is a husband and father basically can't stand his life anymore right after he meets and lust after his daughter's beautiful friend. He decides he wants to live life the way he wants to and doesn't matter what happens. It is told through his narrative and we also see how his wife and his daughter act around him.<br/><br/>The Director tells a wonderful story and also teaches the audience a lesson. He does certain things with the scenes and the actors that must be watched carefully. Plainly just a beautifully done movie. Deserves all the nominations and awards it recieved.<br/><br/>Scenes to watch for: Kevin Spacey throughout the whole film! The dinner scenes, the scene with the moving plastic bag."

","I was eager to see this once available on rental because I was wondering what all the fuss was about.  After having seen it, I'm still wondering.  At the risk of inducing a lot of indignant e-mail, I have to say that I didn't think this film was all that great.  As a matter of fact, it was only somewhere between okay and good.<br/><br/>Admittedly, it was an effective lampoon of American culture, with the clear message that life is ironic and we need to get our priorities straight.  But it was far from a defining moment in cinematic history, as has been implied in all the hype.  The fact that it is rated the #2 movie of all time on the IMDb list sends me an even more frightening message about American culture than the film itself.<br/><br/>The film had a sardonic tone and a wry style, most certainly by design, but it was taken to excess to the point of being bizarre and cartoonish.  The humor was sophomoric, the characters were more like caricatures than people and everything in the film was dreadfully clichÃ©.  The story gets high marks for irreverence, but not for realism or subtlety.<br/><br/>The direction by Sam Mendes, other than that of the actors, was really nothing special.  Other than a few vista shots, some rose petal shots and the dancing paper bag, it was visually pretty mundane.  It was also structurally unsound as a first person narrative.  The narrative format is from the speaker's perspective and implicitly must limit itself to events the speaker experienced directly or of which he had indirect knowledge.  The film included numerous scenes and conversations of which Lester could not possibly have had any knowledge by the end of the film.  That's just sloppy storytelling.<br/><br/>The one area where this film shines is the acting.  Though I don't agree with the character interpretations, the character presentations were superb. Kevin Spacey was fantastic as Lester.  He got better as the movie progressed as he was allowed to break out of his caricature.  Annette Benning was not allowed that luxury, but played the fanatical yuppie role to the hilt.  Thora Birch as daughter Jane had the good fortune of playing the only realistic character in the entire movie.  She was quite impressive, playing the part with a sensitivity and poise belying her experience as an actress.<br/><br/>This was a decent film, no more, no less.  There were so many excellent films in 1999, that it is hard for me to understand this film's mass appeal. Perhaps we have become so overwrought as a society that this film struck a chord.  That is decidedly to its credit, but it doesn't make it a great film.  I rate it a 6/10.  A huge disappointment."

I never thought I would see it in my lifetime: *The Perfect Ten Screenplay*.<br/><br/>I missed this one in the theater, and after all the hoopla at the Academy Awards, I figured it was worth bypassing, despite its number two status on the IMDB.  It didn't seem to be ""my type of movie,"" from what I had heard about it.  I'm happy to say that I was as wrong as can be.  This film deserves every Academy Award, every nomination, every other award and accolade it has gotten and will ever get.

I loved the characters in this movie--all of them. So multi-dimensional, so real. I've read some of the other comments from people who say the movie was too dark, or too depressing, or even too predictable. Well, I've never seen any movie that could turn a flying plastic bag into a work of visual poetry.

","After all of the awards and hype the only thing I found appealing about American Beauty is the screenplay by Alan Ball. I think this film is highly over-rated and other films more deserving of the Best Picture Oscar (perhaps Fight Club).<br/><br/>Yes, yes, Annette Benning was excellent, in fact the whole cast was superb. But, this is no cinematic masterpiece.  The story of the dead, strange, suburban husband telling the story of his late/recent life is humorous and has some intriguing moments.  I enjoyed many of the scenes but it seemed the film lurched from good to bad in moments and lacked the continuity that it was pretending to enjoy.<br/><br/>Spacy getting an Oscar for this performance is unacceptable.  He was good, he always seems to outshine the material, but please (again) this performance is highly overrated.<br/><br/>Maybe I need to watch it again to fully understand the reason/reasons the film was so highly touted."

","Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is an ordinary guy. He's forty-something, has a successful job, a pretty wife, and a loving daughter. Or does he? As he examines his life, he notices there's less and less joy in it as the years go by. He also mopes about it a lot, wondering just when it was that the living disappeared from his life. The sex has vanished from his marriage to strong-willed real-estate agent Carolyn (Annette Bening), and his daughter Jane (Thora Birch) detests him. And poor Lester's just stumbling through his dreamlike life, trapped in suburbia, when an encounter with his daughter's best friend Angela (Mena Suvari) wakes him out of his catatonia.<br/><br/>Lester can't keep his mind off Angela, a sexpot who wants to be a model someday. Angela's bossy, manipulative, tough, and very egocentric. She apparently keeps Jane around to make herself feel better and never tires of bragging of her own sexual exploits. Add to that personality an underage, nubile body, and Lester's hooked. When he overhears Angela say to Jane that Lester might be goodlooking if he worked out, Lester begins to pump iron in the garage. Next thing you know, he's smoking pot with the rebel next door (Wes Bentley), who has his OWN litany of psychosocial problems. And then it gets interesting!<br/><br/>Alan Ball's script never lets up, and there are hardly any laggards among the actors, either. Spacey won an Academy Award for his skillful work as the demented, although not without logic, Lester. Lester's creepy - if you had him as a next-door neighbor and knew him well enough, you'd move yourself and your family to another state. Spacey paints Lester, however, not as a single-minded psychopath, but as a reasonable, self-sufficient, logical man who simply wants to revitalize his own existence. Having seen the movie, I simply can't picture another actor turning in this kind of performance. Spacey's characterization is a lot like a car wreck on the turnpike - you can't help but stop and look at it, although you feel guilty about liking what you see.<br/><br/>Annette Bening's no slouch either. The role of Carolyn is a difficult one, as she must appear both together and apart mentally. Her character is amazingly multilayered - she's not just a shallow, career-minded woman, she's a shallow, career-minded woman with emotional problems that could choke Freud. And Thora Birch (remember her as the little kid in Patriot Games?) is magnificent as Jane, the sullen daughter. It's not easy to capture the essence of being a teenager on film, and Birch comes closest than most. <br/><br/>Needless to say, the whole cast is top-notch, as is the direction. Bottom line - this is a creepy, unsettling, one-of-a-kind movie."

","One of the movies which are hard to comment upon. Its everything. Its very realistic, it comments upon the way of life, it is very, very poetical, also sexy sometimes, it is very funny, and well, its also a little bit absurd. And it has only excellent actors.

There is nothing left; his wife and daughter think he's a loser, and he himself has no idea anymore why he's living. Then he falls in love to one of the school friends of his daughter... but thats only the start of the main story thread.<br/><br/>The whole movie is full of interesting scenes where different aspects of life are shown. This movie is simply operating. Unlike ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" or ""The Cider House Rules"", this is really a movie about life, and doesn't taste like an artificial philosophical statement.<br/><br/>I think teenagers should watch different movies; or if they watch this they should realize that it has not been made for them.

"baumer","10","0","0","26 September 1999"," This is the one movie that will change your life.
","I guess I am like many of the viewers in here when I say that I am having trouble putting into words how I feel about this film, because to be quite honest, no amount of praise can really make anyone understand what this movie will do to you. You can read all the glowing reviews and believe all the hype about this small, wonderfully moving movie that is making people fall in love with film all over again, but there is truly nothing that you can say or hear that will justify what this movie is all about. I really believe that this is one film that has more to say than almost any film that I can think of and it has more to give than you can possibly imagine. When I walked out of the theater I was smiling for hours and when I went to work I told all of my cronies that this is a film that will change your life. Not only is this the best film of the year, but this could really be the best movie ever made. And to consider a film to be on that level is tough for me because I believe the two best films ever made are ( in order ) Jaws and JFK. But I will seriously have to reconsider that order now that I have seen American Beauty. And now here lies the problem, how do I put into words the feelings that I feel after seeing this film? <br/><br/>Look closer..... those are interesting words. To be quite honest I'm not sure exactly what they mean here, but I have my own theories. But if you think about life and the people that are in yours and the situations that you are in every day, and if you had to look a little closer at those, then you may realize that nothing is as it seems. And perhaps that is one of the central issues here. Are the strong and confident really as robust as they appear? Are the successful and popular really as happy as they look? Is anyone really as they seem, not just in this movie but in real life. Because I think Kevin Spacey's portrayal of Lester Burnham is really what life should be all about. I think that of everyone in the film, he goes on the greatest journey into self awareness. He is the one that not only does the most growing but also loses and gains the most by the end of the film. But the one thing that he is at the end, is undeniably happy, there is no taking that away from him. But what made him wake up and learn to be happy? Perhaps for many people the answer will vary, but to me, I think he let go. That's all. He let go of all the crap that everyone worries about. And he let go because he realized how futile it is to worry. Think about it, if you worry about losing your job or if your spouse is cheating on you, does it help? Does it do any good for you? No, of course not. The situation will play itself out no matter how much you worry. So why do it? Spacey learns how to relax and not sweat the little things. He goes a little too far with it and ultimately it costs him, but along the way he learned how to live. He learns that life is a gift and one that should be taken advantage of while you're here. <br/><br/>Perhaps this review sounds like mumbo-jumbo to those that haven't seen the film, but I can guarantee that the people that have seen this know exactly what I'm getting at. American Beauty has to be seen to be appreciated.<br/><br/>As little faith as I have in the academy when it comes to Oscar time, you can't ignore this film. I am going to have to concur with an earlier reviewer that said that this should be nominated for Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress, Best Script, Editing and Cinematography. This film is so rich with amazing performances and it is not just from Spacey. But it has to be said here and now; if Kevin Spacey does not win Best Actor this year then the academy is delirious with a bad acid trip. Spacey's interpretation of Lester Burnham is so astute, so captivating, so humorous and so hauntingly real that no matter what age, sex or colour you are, you will see a bit of him in you. Lester Burnham is a microcosm of what we feel and eventually want to be. <br/><br/>American Beauty is the best film to come out this year and without a doubt in the top ten films for all time. See this film, please see it. No matter what you read about this film, nothing can ruin it for you because there is so much in the film that someone could not tell you enough. It is a rare film that will get inside you and not leave for quite some time. It has been three days since I've seen this film and it still makes me smile. There is nothing more I can say about this movie except, go see it, you'll be glad you did. 10/10"

Kevin Spacey gives a candid performance as Lester Burnham,a guy who is suffering from terrible mid-life crisis who slowly and painfully learns that we don't often appreciate the life we have in our lifetime. Annette Bening, Peter Gallagher and Chris Cooper, in solid supporting roles, are excellent as usual. Relative new-comers Wes Bentley and Mena Suvari surprises us with their honest performances. Only Thora Birch is a little disappointing as the sulky teenaged daughter of Lester Burnham.  Much has been made about the so-called surprise ending of The Sixth Sense (1999) but anybody who wants to be really surprised should watch this film especially the final half hour where the characters make shocking discoveries about their lives and themselves. Alan Ball deserves every award he gets for his screenplay. This may be a story about suburban life in America but the story and the characters are not uncommon in other parts of the world."

","This might be the best Hollywood movie of the year, but personally I doubt it. Let alone all the hype about the ""best movie of the decade"" etc. It's unusual, true, but not everything unusual is actually good. A snapshot of American life doesn't reveal anything new, while everybody can identify him/herself with one of those lunatics, living in an otherwise lovely neighborhood. As surrealistic as it might appear to some, it is utmostly and boringly realistic. By trying to capture every side of an average family's life, authors created a very scattered and disconnected picture, with many unexplored and thus totally unnecessary details. None of the messages is fully delivered, and I'm not even sure if there were any. The most clear one is: ""look, that's you and it's your boring life and there's no way out but to die"". Depressing. Occasional dream-scenes with rose petals are only adding to this depressing contrast between the real life and the dream. And still, this fruitful topic is spoiled and punctured with all the distracting characters like gays next door or the ridiculous lover - ""The King"". Even the histerical wife is sticking out as a sore thumb. The pretentiously phylosophical moments involving the drug-addict beauty-seeking teenager could have been developed better, with him being a seducing devil, but authors stop short of working out this theme, just as well as many other potentially interesting topics in the movie. And this is my overall impression: the great ideas and the great intentions were just hinted, mixed together, and left alone - perhaps due to the inability of the authors to cope with the enormous task they've set for themselves. The film leaves one with sad feelings: evrybody and everything is sad, and even the appearing-to-be-sarcasting hero is endlessly sad, and so is his wife and daughter, and their neighbours, and all the story. And I don't even want to see it again."

","This film is highly acclaimed and is a great cinematic achievement. Not many of the critics have understood what the film is all about though. Kevin Spacey plays a father and husband that has ceased to live. He is however awakened by the appearance of a young beautiful girl who is a friend of his daughter. Seeking her sexual confirmation he get´s his act together and is rejuvenated for the better-or worse. His wife, who can only control herself (and her neuroses) by controlling her spouse, loses control over herself when he gains independence. She also feels inadequate in her profession and seeks the confirmation of ""The King of Real Estate"". In the end when Spacey´s total independence becomes clear, she feels victimized-he has taken away her self control by gaining control over his own life. His daughter, uncertain of her sexappeal is confirmed by her neighbor. The neighbor´s father, a Marine Colonel, can only control his desires by beating his son, although his son is aware of who he´s really blowing-himself.<br/><br/> The daughter´s  friend, the sexy teenager who´s Spacey´s object of desire, seeks confirmation by bragging about her sexual escapades. Since she is dependent on other´s belief and whim she is devastated when her bluff is revealed. She then seeks confirmation in Spacey´s arms. When he gets the confirmation he has sought for so long he sees no point in fulfilling his fantasy. He got the ""final confirmation"" and moved on to total independence.

I don't understand why this movie has been treated as ""The Darling of 1999"". I realize that all of these situations exist in today's world, but to have them all in one family is a little too far-fetched for me.

","AMERICAN BEAUTY, or DAVID LYNCH DIRECTS THE WONDER YEARS, is the VANITY FAIR crowds idea of a great movie.  You know, those people whom decry narrow mindedness then stereotype everyone whom disagrees with them.  The crowd who decries materialism, while riding around in their Volvos or Mercedes Benzes. AMERICAN BEAUTY has something to offend everybody: explicit adultery, drug usage, teen sex, statutory rape, teen nudity, masturbation, males kissing, extreme domestic violence, voyerism, excessive profanity; let's see, have I left out anything?  The movie IS (mostly) well acted (especially Mena Suvari and Wes Bentley), the exceptions being the campy homosexual couple, played by Sam Robards and Scott Bakula.  PLEEEASE! Can't we have some non-swishy homosexual role models for once?  Of course not; it's THAT kind of movie. And, of course, the LEAST screwed up character in the entire film turns out to be a teen drug dealer.  He ""sees"" the REAL beauty in the world, including that in Kevin Spacey's ""homely,"" ""flat- chested"" daughter (Thora Birch). BEELIEEEVE ME; Thora Birch is NEITHER homely NOR flat-chested!  Director Sam Mendes and Writer Alan Ball DO provide SOME surprising moments.  However, both the ""revelation"" about the nubile teen temptress (Mena Suvari) and the ""surprise"" killer are, at once, too pat AND unconvincing. AMERICAN BEAUTY is not even as quirky, imaginative, surprising or funny as the average episode of NORTHERN EXPOSURE.  And, as the VANITY FAIR crowd LOVES to do, AMERICAN BEAUTY celebrates the beauty of life while focusing on its ugliness. A REAL quibble.  In at LEAST three places in the film, transition marks are clearly visible on the print (as though we were watching workprint, rather than a final ""cut"").  Are Spielberg, Katzenberg, and Geffen THAT cheap that they wouldn't afford to reshoot those three scenes?

I've seen it 5 times now, and every time it made me cry- not from sadness, but the beauty of life it reveals.<br/><br/>Living overseas, I've realized how truly lucky I am to be an American.  We have more chances in life than anyone, and yet, as ""American Beauty"" shows, we throw it away.  This film has changed how I view life- it taught me not to throw away ANYTHING.  Not to throw away a simple image of a plastic bag floating on the wind.  Not to give up on anyone, including myself. I go to see it again and again so that I can walk away from it with this wonderful feeling that every little part of life really is beautiful.<br/><br/>It is funny, it is sad... but somehow what should be a ""sad"" story turns out to be something truly remarkable.

","American Beauty is a film about bad decisions, past, present and future. Possibly the worst one (and the competition was strong) was Jane's.  My overriding feeling after seeing this brilliant film was feeling sorry for her.  Where did we fail her?  Why did she end up with the worst character in the film, one without any redeeming features?  AB needs a sequel, Jane needs to right herself.  I don't know how.  It will require another very clever screenplay."

","The film seems to move effortlessly beyond the satirical, to the places where real pain and vulnerability lurk. The central image was not, for me, the beautiful film (NOTE the fictionality and artefact) of the bag blowing. it was the image of catatonic stillness, the silent despair of Mrs Fitts sitting (not swirling) at her dining room table and subsequently woodenly saying goodbye to her son. I was amazed and astounded by it all. One thing though that discomforts me. So much of the time Annette Bening had the verbal and facial mannerisms of Shirley McLaine. What's that all about Warren?"

"DomiMMHS","10","0","0","20 April 2000"," None of that annoying stuff! (plus, my thoughts on your rants, i.e. my own rant)
","I've only read ""a few"" reviews here (that is about 60) and well, and I don't know why people rant their souls out and almost kill each other for liking (more often) or disliking the film. It's neither somewhat revolutionary and unstandably truthful, nor is it stereotypical and fake, it's only good. But it's plain good, it's very very very good, actually. But that's all there is to it. It's very enjoyable, though the pace is rather slow, it's satire and the characters are intriguing.<br/><br/>I have to disagree with those who say the characters are one-dimensional, it's a lie. It's just that we are rather supposed to have fun with them than to examine their wounded souls until we can't sit straight because of the pain, if you know what I mean. (I guess I tend to express myself a little melodramatically, I'm sorry for that)<br/><br/>To start off with Lester Burnham, to all you stupids, he is not a pedophile! What are you thinking? In my world this word describes people who are very very much more disgusting in what they think and do, believe me. I don't think I have to go in further detail. Angela is almost adult, and she really asks for it... men lusting after her. She even says it herself that she likes it, and especially IF that's only the lie of an insecure little girl, the bitch shouldn't talk so big. Lusty Lester is what she gets in return for her behavior.<br/><br/>Much more than this bad word with a ""p"" some hysterical individuals apparently like to employ, Lester is a hero! Not because what he does is right or great, but because he tells all the jerks to p**s off and let him enjoy himself in his little ruts. He doesn't bother anyone so no one should bother him. He wakes up from his suburban zombie existence and finds something like inner peace. Two factors triggered this journey of Lester: his crazy infatuation with Angela, and even before that the absolutely unsupportable behavior of his wife, Carolyn, who is really such a jerk and such a phony.<br/><br/>Great performances by Kevin Spacey and Chris Cooper, and also the rest of the cast does very fine jobs. (It's good that Thora Birch is back!)<br/><br/>For what I wanted to express with my summary line: it's an all-American, all-Hollywood movie, but there's nothing of that typical Hollywood kitsch. Absolutely nothing! The emotions are rather restricted and true, and the dialogue is fantastic. Not those annoying ""There is that guy and what does the guy do? He sees that door where you could ring the bell..."" monologues that seem to be supposed to be cool. Only the things that have to be said, plus jokes that hit.<br/><br/>The amount of violence is okay, and for those who rant about the sexuality, vulgar language, teens smoking etc. (I've read some of the reviews from ""Christian web sites"" you can get linked to from here)... come on people, open your eyes! That's reality! Who of you thinks the 17-year-old kids in your neighborhood read the bible every evening before they go to bed at 9:30 and pray to the Lord above that they can keep their virginity until they marry?<br/><br/>Fine, the movie messes with the morals. But that's the fun about it. If not everyone would behave like such a jerk, no one would get hurt, believe me... maybe that's the tragedy about it. Well, I guess if all of us were like Lester it would all collapse. But on the other hand, if we all were like Carolyn we should all shoot ourselves. I hate her character, but I also feel sorry for her.<br/><br/>To draw a conclusion: it would be a nice change if things would have worked out for Lester. But why not dream. The tragedy of life is that there is so much beauty, but it's all bound to get so damn messed up. That's what the movie conveys in a very light and funny way and with very much irony of situation. It's hilarious, but don't look at it as intellectual or art. Just let Lester *rule* once in a lifetime. Rating: 10"

American Beauty<br/><br/>
Directed by: Sam Mendes, 1999<br/><br/><br/><br/>Electricity in the air<br/><br/>
""I rule,"" Lester Burnham wryly remarks. Unemployed, middle-aged and traumatized by what appears to be a mid-life crisis, these are his words after having purchased the sports car of his boyhood dreams, casually sipping beer from the bottle, dressed in a sweatshirt, bare feet up on the coffee table, and provocatively addressing his bewildered wife, a wretched and cocky real-estate mogul. <br/><br/>It's liberation, it's freedom and we  the viewers  feel it instinctively.<br/><br/> Such is American Beauty through and through. Brimming with sardonic humor and seemingly ready to pop at any given minute. A sharp and incisive critique of modern day consumerism but also a deliriously funny and insightful ""set-piece"" concerning the post-American-dream America waking up to discover that their eggs are burnt, pancakes notoriously fattening and coffee mysteriously caffeine free. Yes, I am talking in metaphors. The solution? Push the panic button and hit meltdown. American Beauty does so and with an appetite. <br/><br/>Imagine the twisted human hollowness that was so nakedly portrayed in Happiness and so evocatively questioned in Pleasantville. Then cross it with the visual beauty and thematic sorrow of The Ice Storm by way of Spielberg's heartfelt suburban odes to underlying discontent  as glimpsed in Close Encounters of the Third Kind and ET  and you'll have an idea of both the theme and style of American Beauty.<br/><br/>This is a debut for director Sam Mendes and an amazing achievement. The director and screenwriter have equipped Burnham with something as rare as an opening monologue  not a play-by-play but more of a fairy tale introduction  a major spoiler none the same. To top that off, the best scenes are courtesy of some splendid and intertwined dreamy passages  thick and rich on symbolism and both sexy and surreal  that blend in effortlessly. This is ambiguous and successful filmmaking containing an original cinematic spark.<br/><br/>
So, what is wrong with Burnham? Nothing really. Life just got the best of him. His conflict could be an awakening or an emancipation just as well as any classic midlife crisis. <br/><br/>We are of course inclined to believe that it is anything but the latter. Burnham has seen the light.<br/><br/>However, you'll be disappointed if you go in expecting the movie to come up with any new angles or answers. American Beauty is a movie much in the vein of the late 90s  a product of the time it was made in  as it revolves around a general rebellion against all forms of normality, dot.commies and basic consumerism. Nothing more, nothing less. Some characters are as deep as cereal bowls. The message being nothing more than a Nike commercial; Just Do It'.<br/><br/>American Beauty is best when it colorfully and maniacally sticks to Burnham; depicting this little man like a shark circling a victim. You gaze in awe and instinctively familiarize with him, yet at the same time there is an acute awareness of both the frustration, hidden viciousness and primal egotistical nature beneath the smooth surface. If our schools had such a thing as a ""suburbia one-on-one"" class  to warn kids of the dangers of forgetting to live your life after thirty or forty  then this could be the mainstay of that curriculum. <br/><br/>Amidst the Hollywood stereotyping (the couple next door), the movie somehow still works fabulously. It actually feels like anti-formula because it is  face it  so charmingly formula. I am merely addressing parts I felt didn't work as well as intended, because I was so impressed by the overall movie.<br/><br/>The urge to deliver that drips from American Beauty from start to finish  from the masterful direction by Mendes to all the hypnotic performances  make it a memorable and definite late 90s benchmark and most certainly one to be considered a classic in the years to come."

","Is there anything left to say about this movie, after all the awards, after all the approval and, yes, also after all the disapproval (""Hated it""; ""Don't believe the hype!"" etc.)<br/><br/>Listen folks: Believe the hype! For American Beauty is a masterpiece  for various reasons of which I'd like to mention a few. First of all there are just a couple of movies that contain so many ""magic moments"": Scenes to remember for a long, long time after you left the cinema. Scenes which instantly come to your mind when thinking of a movie. Scenes like these:<br/><br/>Angela lying in the bathtub full of rose petals. Lester driving in his car, smoking pot and loudly singing ""American Woman"". Colonel Fitts, soaking wet, entering Lester's garage. The love scene between Lester and his ""object of beauty"", ending with Angela's confession. And so on and so on.<br/><br/>Not to forget the plastic bag dancing in the wind, a magic moment that might make film history. And finally the movie's last sequence, Lester's last words  an ending that is sad and beautiful at once.<br/><br/>Apart from that, American Beauty shows us the dark voids that lie under the squeaky clean surface of the middle-class homes. It opens our eyes for the beauty in life. It makes us think whether happiness really lies in an Italian designer sofa and a bungalow with a swimming-pool or maybe rather in the golden brown leaves falling from a tree on an autumn day. Or in the faces of the persons we love.<br/><br/>When Lester has spoken his last words and the screen is dark, you do leave the cinema but don't necessarily leave the movie. Maybe you never will. In this impact on the viewer lies the strength of American Beauty, not to mention its other qualities like great acting, directing and cinematography.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the 20 best I have ever seen. It has got what it takes to become an all-time classic. 10/10"

","That anyone thought it was necessary to make this picture alone is disturbing enough, but to have it win five Academy Awards really makes me worry for American society and cinema.  I will not deny the depth of characterization nor the many levels explored, ad nauseum, nor the superior level of acting.  It is however, the same old story of the depravity of the human spirit and how low we can sink as humans.  If you want an edgy story with redemption of the human condition try The Cider House Rules, a far superior picture!  This film is not entertainment in my book.  Save your money."

","Satire is an ambiguous genre: The theater play or a movie of satire genre is funny to everyone that doesn't understand how serious the issue is, and it's tragic and shocking to everyone that does.<br/><br/>For that matter, I find `American Beauty' an intelligent, slick and powerful film which is at the same time an earsplitting absurdity comedy, and a tragic and provocative modern everyday drama. One will roll all over the floor from laughter, the other will be horrified for knowing that what is seen is not a fiction  that or very similar things happen in our back yard every day, and it's a ruthless daily routine we do or do not directly face.<br/><br/>I think it's impressive how the creators managed to keep such twisted motives and layers subtle and smooth enough not to enter the list of dark movies, but still keep the tone of serious and stratified. I was also impressed how a stage play director skilfully and persuasively handles the world where there is no limit in space (especially smooth, easy and sly frame handling, consistent narration clarity and visibly excellent collaboration with the actors). And precise performances by Spacey, Cooper, Bently and Birch, together with correctly casted Benning and Suvari, elevate the entireness to even a higher level which it would not achieve without the mentioned. Imagine anyone else with the same interpretation of Lester Burnham. I can't.<br/><br/>Yes, I consider that the look of the film's final cut desperately lacks more specific atmosphere and the ending from the first screenplay draft (I read the original draft the day after seeing the movie because I knew something was wrong with the ending  and I was right; that tells you enough), although that does not make it a lot worse.<br/><br/>I was pretty surprised with all those Academy Awards `American Beauty' received, considering that it's contemporary and not epic, but also, in some way, constructed too traditionally and conventionally for the Academy's taste. Maybe because it's the first satire of that quality. Ambiguous."

","This movie is absolutely amazing. Lester is my hero.  He just says to hell with it all, he is so fed up with the ordinary lives people lead and realizes its time to have fun.  He realizes that life is short and we dont have to listen to other people who tell us what we can and cant do, should or shouldnt do. In his own words, he rules. Why go through life never getting what you want, always giving in to what others expect of you, life is not about making other people content, its about enjoying yourself and doing what makes you happy.  It takes a lot to make Lester realize this and he does go about it in a rash way, but it is so perfect in the movie.  From telling his boss to shove it, buying a 1970 Firebird, smoking with Ricky, taking a job at a fast food joint, and finally seducing Angela - he does what pleases him and makes it clear that he answers to no one but himself. Life is short, have fun because death is much longer."

Although, that movie didn't have the incredible level of self-importance and total lack of originality that American beauty shows the viewer for 2 hours.  This is a great movie for letting the average film viewer feel like they can appreciate art.  My message to them is know what you're talking about before you recommend that I waste my afternoon staring at this waste of celluloid.  Better films this year include almost all of them, but especially Eyes Wide Shut, The Insider, Election, The Sixth Sense, and The Limey.

","Ok, this movie has been hyped to ridiculous extremes. Simply put, this was an original idea (hell beneath the surface of suburbia) in 1954 when Rebel Without a Cause was released. The wife is a cardboard cut-out, the husband, who we the audience is supposed to identify with in his rebellion against stifling suburban life, lacks any redeeming value from the first scene. The character should have started as a schlemiel and THEN grown to fight back against his shallow life. I, personally, was happy his character was murdered. Cheap easy laughs form the basis of this tired script.  If you want to see a better film in this vein, one with true depth, poetry and complexity that doesn't make it so easy for the audience to feel superior to the lives of it's pathetic characters, see the Ice Storm.<br/><br/>

","American Beauty 9 -10/10<br/><br/>It is an above average film which is rare in a year but every year products one or two ones. The subject is showing what is hidden behind the American's paradise, American's kind and smile. Money doesn't make people happy not even in America, and there are a lot of  miscarried, average, dull courses of life on the other side of the ocean. Of course we in Hungary or in Europe know indeed that USA is not an earth paradise, and there are problems with American people too. A book the title of which is about Why we can't bear the Americans, (take it easy it is only a joke) is being published in Hungary now, involves the stereotypy about average Americans which are involved in this film. The film shows the average suburban Americans as we see them from outside.<br/><br/>The film focused on a suburban family and its neighbours. It shows people who are ordinary but they don't want to be, they want to have exciting life and meet the requirements of big American society. There are people among them who lives average, dull life have got common emotions and ambitions but they accepted themselves and only want to live their life and feel well. They are indeed free is a free world. They find each other. One of them has a camera and records the American beauty which is not what we think of at first, it is more common. The leading man Lester becomes from ordinary petty-minded individual to free, likeable man. <br/><br/>The best point of the film is that it is not an art film, it doesn't want people to think their life seriously and change it. It shows the dark side of AMERICAN ORDINARY LIFE in entertaining way and the audience can laugh and cry at the same time. As if the film said; this is our life, it is beautiful in its ugly and you have to accept it. Because I don't think, that most American people will change their minds, their lives because of the film.<br/><br/>About the actors and actresses:  Extraordinary Kevin Spacey has a very good role and who might did better the role than it was originally. In Hungary there is a special topic for him where the fans let adore him. He preserved it and an Oscar award. I support for Anette Benning too at Oscar ceremony, and everybody was very good."

","We fly over Suburbia LA as the dead Lester Burnham narrates his wisdom on modern life, that commences with a morning masturbation session in the shower, followed by the rest of the day that goes down hill from there. This SUNSET BOULEVARD  approach of the dead man narrating works a treat here as we now know what happens to him, but it's the why and who that intrigues us. The first image of the movie shows his daughter, Jane, on video, wishing his sleazy father was dead. But surely they couldn't give us that much information all in the opening minutes. So we sit there and wait in wonder.<br/><br/>To distract us from who is going to do the killing of Lester, we enter via another door with the plaque, ""Mid-Life Crises"". That's the excuse they use when someone in his early forties goes through a radical change in life. A poor title for a poor excuse. What Lester shows us through the pen of script writer, Alan Ball, is that the so-called mid-life crises is the realisation that there is more to life than the game you are playing. This comes through Lester's deteriorating relationship with his wife, Carolyn and daughter Jane. His job is an absolute bore and it seems he won't be able to hold it down any longer. What turns the tables is the meeting of two teenage kids. One is Jane's friend, Angela, the blonde beauty who supplies the rose pedals in Lester's dreams, giving him that extra push to live so he could conquer her. The other is the dope, supplied by the video freak neighbour, Ricky, which relaxes him and allows him to relive those teenage years where loud Seventies music accompanies the cruising of your vehicle.<br/><br/>Lets not forget the rest of the Burnham family. We have wife Carolyn, struggling to make something of herself as a Real Estate Agent. She lives in a picture perfect world with a perfect house, a perfect rose garden, perfect car and perfect body with looks to match. But the insides of the mind are rotting away as her failure turns to other options to save her, mainly that of an affair. Daughter Jane is still young and could be spared of this life. She tends to hang back and watch her parents go round the bend. But they soon spill into her territory, where she really doesn't want them. It's the relationship with the neighbour Ricky and his video camera that awakens her.<br/><br/>There we have the supposedly dysfunctional middle class American family. Next is the neighbours. What is Suburbia without them? If you are facing the Burnham house, you would find that to their left lives a gay couple and to their right lives the Nazi Colonel, Frank Fitts and family. In the centre is the Burnham family, who would rather stay that way with their political ideology because it's always safe to just sit on the fence.<br/><br/>Writer, Alan Ball, has drawn the perfect symbolic structure of life, not only in America but everywhere. This film will be viewed as the RAZOR'S EDGE of the Twenty First century, where humans don't have to travel in search of the meaning to their existence, but only have to look into their own back yard to find it. Lester Burnham does just that and maybe finds it all that little bit too late.<br/><br/>First time director, Sam Mendes, makes a proper job out of Ball's script with the help of Conrad L. Hall's photography. But one cannot help and think of the early films of Atom Egoyan when viewing the style and approach, (FAMILY VIEWING, SPEAKING PARTS, CALENDER) . Maybe its because of the relationship between Ricky and the video imagery. Atom's films dealt with the video medium as the main thrust in shaping human lives. There is also the photographic style in the wide shots, that if you freeze them, they become the perfect family portrait. It's only when the images move do we see the ugly side. For a British theatre director to cross over into a Hollywood film,  Mendes did an astounding job in showing us the American psyche.<br/><br/>
To cap it all off is the performances. Kevin Spacey has a ball as Lester. Annette Bening as Carolyn almost hams it up but never crosses that line of absurdity. Thora Birch as Jane is the only one that keeps the top on her performance, giving her that air of mystery. Mena Suvari as Angela is the perfect wet dream who seems to have come out of one of those bad teenage school campus flics of the Eighties. Peter Gallagher as Buddy Kane, the sleazy Real Estate agent, is very effective in a small role. The mad Colonel Frank Fitts as played by Chris Cooper adds that extra edge, something for the audience to boo at. And last but not least is the brilliant Wes Bentley as the video freak, Ricky Fitts. One cannot help but notice the similarity of looks between him and director Sam Mendes!"

If you're miserable in your marriage, for example, it MUST be your spouse's fault so therefore cheating on him/her is totally justified. Had a great time smoking pot as a teen?  Then spending $2000 on a premium bag is just what you need.   Perhaps the movie IS a statement that what seems normal is not, but I think that all those in Hollywood who put it on it's plateau must condone it for some reason--perhaps it exemplified their lives or what they've always wanted to do."

","If you go and see American Beauty, please ignore the hype and try to forget anything that anybody has ever told you about it, including the (subsequent) contents of this review. If you watch the film with a relaxed and open mind, I believe that you are guaranteed to enjoy it.<br/><br/>Reading many of these reviews, I realise that many reviewers seem to complain that some of the themes that this film deals with are presented in a clichéd, ""Hollywood"", or deliberately ""anti-Hollywood"" fashion. I have just seen the film for the second time at the cinema tonight, having waited almost two months to see it again. My intention was to try to analyse the technical composition of the film, and view it with a neutral, uncompassionate eye. However, just as on the first viewing, the film utterly engrossed me in its story, leaving me no opportunity to specifically think about the direction, or camerawork, or any other such technicality. For me, this is incredibly impressive, and is the mark of a great film. However, the emotion that I have felt on leaving the cinema on both viewings, now, is very hard to describe. It is not true to say that the film demolishes any stereotypes or avoids any clichés, and at no point did it seem to be trying to be pompously attempting to ""break the mould"" (with the possible exception of certain plastic bags). However, the sheer execution of the film, especially in the fantastic acting, direction, and overall ""feel"" of the film is incredibly cohesive - bringing the production together into something that is utterly complete in its own right.<br/><br/>American Beauty appears as if it has been made with absolutely no concern to producing a film which is in any way extreme. It does not stand up to sophisticated attacks on its clichés, stereotypes, or plot-devices - and nor is it intended to. Overall, everything comes together in an admirably unpretentious way to form a film which is phenomenally engrossing and enjoyable in that it sets out to tell a simple drama, without any particular subtexts or pretences, and does so breathtakingly well.<br/><br/>Please go and see this film; the chances are high that absolutely anybody in a relatively open, relaxed mood will be able to be swept away by its holistic beauty. If anything, I personally attribute the phenomenal soundtrack to giving the film some of its magic, although this is obviously only part of the whole story.<br/><br/>I feel that there is a universal emotion conveyed by this film which should be open to everybody, but many people seem to have not been receptive to it - preferring to deconstruct it and individually criticise its components. I don't understand how people can miss the point of this film - that there IS NO POINT to get excited about; American Beauty revolves about letting yourself be open to the powerful, yet unassuming drama that it is.<br/><br/>Looking Closer, at least without appreciating the film as a whole, can only lead you further from understanding why a lot of people think that it deserves the Best Picture Oscar that it has attained. It is a simple, yet wondrous drama. 10 out of 10."

","Having seen this film four times now, I feel ready to begin to plumb the depths of this modern masterpiece.  'American Beauty' stands as a solemn exposure of the hollowness of the American dream.  And the more times I watch it, the more the film polarizes.  My first watch I laughed at pretty much everything.  But by the fourth time, some bits had become even funnier, and other bits didn't make me laugh at all, because they were just plain sad.<br/><br/>Whilst this may not have the adrenaline hit of its cousin 'Fight Club', it is much more poignant, and repeated viewings yield greater benefits.  I actually thought both the films possessed a somewhat adolescent rhetoric, but all the adults I've spoken to about this movie absolutely adored it too.<br/><br/>So I'm not going to be regurgitatious and say what's been said already.

I advise others to go with this same expectation, because I think it is as a comedy that this film works best.

I was very disappointed when Annette Bening did not win for Best Actress because she truly deserved to win the Oscar. Kevin Spacey was wonderfully acted and deserved the Oscar that he won. Sam Mendes did a spectacular job on directing the picture. Alan Ball deserved for best screenplay and it was also deserved for best cinematography. I was disappointed that the supporting roles in this movie did not get nominated for an Oscar at all because without their performances it wouldn't had been a great movie. They put the life into the movie and the movie is ealistic showing that no family is a perfect family. It shows the typical American family falling apart with the husband Lester (Spacey) as a confused husband who quit his job and his now pretty much obsessed with his daughter's best friend. His wife Carolyn (Bening) is also having problems of her own and she has many different moods. This is a dark comedy and surely would be remembered for a long time.

","A movie which depicts many levels of a person's life in certain ages and also in a certain country. But, most of it is quite applicable outside the US as well, for people's problems are similar in Europe and other euro-originated civilization continents too. It would be worthless trying to tell its story because it is a multi level one, dealing at the same time with midd-life crises, marriage problems, teenage problems, homosexuality, drugs, joy, lack of joy, ugliness and beauty. I found many people being hard in their comments on many cliches of the movie, but those cliches seem to be there very intentionally and with a strong purpose of unmasking their common and every day use by most of us. People commented that this movie tells us what we already know, but if so, why do we keep going so...? I can not help to note that all the spoilers and hard comments came from the United States and I wonder whether that is a sign that this movie has hit the nerve of the society which it primarily depicts. If so, the praise-worthy is the decision to award it with five Academy Awards, for it means that many wouldn't run away from scary phenomena occuring more and more, but would instead, face them and think about them and, as it's been already said, unmask them in order to overcome them. That is an integral and improving part of life and the reason why this movie does not only resemble life closely, but is rather an insert from a real life."

This movie was good not because of serious plot twist(yes, the plot was predictable at times), and not because of heavy doses of action. Instead, it works like Sixth Sense does in a way and plays on the mind. It's a movie which requires and sparks further discussion. This movie is something that should be played in a high school English class and have it be analyzed with classics like GREAT GATSBY(speaking of which, i find some parallels between this movie and that novel).  If you haven't seen it already, it's quite worth your money. Just don't expect those jaw-dropping plot twists or a quick pace drama.

"Mike C.-2","10","0","0","8 April 2000"," Magnificent film.
","From beginning to end, American Beauty is a joy to watch. No one movie has displayed the full array of human emotions like American Beauty does. Some of you who seem to dislike the movie have problems with some of the issues in the film, such as making a pot smoker, who lusts after a teenager, a protagonist. Perhaps the problem lies not within the film, but within your own insecurities. This film is about re-evaluating your own thoughts and emotions. It makes you think about your own nature. <br/><br/>Others of you out there seem to think that all of these issues have been touched upon already in other films. Normally, I'd agree that much of the subject matter in the film has been covered elsewhere already. However, it is the performances that make this look at human nature fresh and interesting. Spacey has his best performance since Verbal Kint, and I don't think Benning has had a better performance in her career.<br/><br/>
To truly appreciate this film, don't simply try and break it down to its elements. Every movie looks the same when you pick them apart. Look at this movie as a whole. If you haven't seen it, I strongly recommend you do so. Make up your own mind about this film. Some may see it as cliched and repetitive. But I, like many others, see it as brilliant. Not the best movie I've ever seen (Not even the best movie with Kevin Spacey that I've seen (The Usual Suspects)), but certainly in my top ten of all time."

I saw the movie after all the hype and my wife's insistence. Granted, there is some pretty good acting by Spacey and Benning, but I didn't see anything extraordinary. My personal theory: Anything Spacey stars in gets this kind of rave reviews due to his links to the Theatre. We Americans have a penchant to appear cerebral and intellectual and pretend to appreciate anything dished out in the name of 'art'.

It ain't very psychological to film a plastic bag for 15 minutes and see the beauty of life in it. That Wes Bentley guy beats it all by the way.

But when that happened I really wonder WHAT exactly it was that fascinated me so much. It just seemed boring and so sloooooooooooooooooow. The 3rd time I saw it ( right before this review ) I thought it was a complete mess. Only the actors get some credit after this viewing. Everybody claims Sam Mendes ( Director ) is the best thing since sliced bread, but he sure is not in my opinion. Road to Perdition was boring as well. There were a lot of good films in 1999, The Green Mile to name just one, who all were a lot better than this one. I recommend them ! And if you do want to see this...make sure you only watch it once.

All of those people deserved the unanimous critical praise that they received for their great performances. As did Sam Mendes for his deft direction. And the music was wonderful. I felt overall, however, the movie became tedious and preachy.  I get the idea of having every stereotype of dysfunctional suburba society all living right next door too each other.  But all of their dysfunctions had been brought up before.  Nothing that this movie said had not been said before.  This is just the first time that all of this analysis of the problems in suburban America had been attacked all at once. Also,the script was written in such a way that it was so enamored with itself that what it was saying became meaningless.  Some scenes, mostly those involving the Wes Bentley character, (though again, he gave a great performance) were so falsely brilliant that it was oppressive.  It was as though the words coming from the characters mouths were the greatest observations about American society that ever were conceived. Even when American Beauty was making a good point, like the sofa scene, it was as though the writer was taunting you and saying, ""look how brilliant I am.""  When I left the movie I felt that the movie had bullied me into thinking that it was brilliant and original, but in reality it wasn't. I think that Kevin Spacey deserved his Academy Award, and Anette Bening deserved to win. As did Sam Mendes.  But to call this movie the best picture of 1999 is ridiculous.

Compare past films to this and tell me that this is the 2nd highest rated on the database?  The movie is misleading in it's advertising. A dark comedy?  A dark drama!  There were times during the film when members of the audience would laugh and I wondered how could they possibly find that funny?  Save your money, don't even bother renting this movie!"

","I went to see American Beauty with high hopes. At the time it was hotly tipped for Oscar glory and had received fantastic reviews in the US and the UK. This was obviously an ambitious film. It tried to make incisive points about American society, art, beauty and freedom of self-expression. Most of these were bungled. We are supposed to sympathise (or even empathise) with Kevin Spacey's character and yet Annette Bening is a figure of ridicule. Surely her character who is still ""trapped"" in the materialism of the American dream who is the real victim. If you want to watch a great film with a similar theme, watch Fight Club. Ultimately American Beauty has some funny moments but it is nowhere near the equal of the film that ""inspired"" it - Sunset Boulevard. For a film that is supposed to be so ground-breaking, American Beauty is far too cliched and far to derivative."
"julianajackson","3","2","5","18 July 2018"," Odd, yet beautiful cinematography
","The directing style is without a doubt exceptionally original and eye-catching. The storyline as well conveys uniqueness and necessary plot elements such as imhanced character development by the climax of the film. HOWEVER, the story continues to feel wrong and misleading of morality as the main character, a grown man, is fantasizing about a young girl. She is, although beautiful, very young. I believe the movie would have been best if she was just slightly older, and at least AN ADULT! She could have remained innocent and naive and then perhaps the romanticizing of pedophilla wouldn't be so prominent in the film industry. This idea of a man falling in love with a younger woman is not at all a story that lacks interest. It is, however, a story that leaves room for human decency. American Beauty is not that type of story though. American Beauty is a man falling for a young GIRL who is his daughter's best friend. This film screams an uncomfortable and uneasy tone with in a person who has even the slightest sense of right and wrong. It is because of this constant moral disturbance in the audience that leads the viewer to no longer sympathize with the main character which of course keeps the film from completing its main objective."
"MaesterFilm","4","2","5","31 January 2017"," Well-made but ultimately pointless film.
","This film is well acted and well directed, but what is the point of the story?<br/><br/>It's not a particularly interesting take on the suburban dystopia. What it says is all cliché, there is nothing new. Cheating wife, husband with terrible job, sexual frustration, bored teenager, yeah, nothing new so far. Extremist neighbor who is a closeted, self-hating homosexual, this is also old. The daughter is friends with a moody emo teen that wants to run away and sexually promiscuous and morally vacuous friend girlfriend.<br/><br/>It plays like theater but it's not really funny. <br/><br/>It attempts to be subversive but it really isn't. A mid-life crisis is not really subversive in any way.<br/><br/>A more interesting story would be if Lester's acting out was expanded upon. For example, he works in a fast food store. Let him become friends with the teens there, sharing joints during lunch break, exchanging non-elevator music, etc. Let him become friends with a bunch of punks and misfits, showing his own sense of being an outcast. Maybe the teens are using him, maybe he's using them. Maybe they think he's cool, maybe they don't, or maybe they don't care and don't judge him and that's what he likes. Maybe he uses the settlement money to fund Ricky Fits' first film. Maybe he meets a young girl at the burger joint.<br/><br/>I'm just throwing ideas around to explain the lack of consequence in this film. He quits his job, his wife gets angry, but there's no consequence. He works at a fast food joint, sees his wife cheating, still no consequence. Nothing changes from these life-changing events.<br/><br/>The ending appears to be an intertwining of all the subplots, a domino effect of sorts, but it really isn't. Rejecting the colonel's sexual advances resulted in the colonel killing him. It's a random event. There is no buildup to it. The colonel coming to Lester comes out of nowhere, the kiss came out of nowhere and that's it.<br/><br/>Highly overrated film."

","Just another example of Hollywood's blatant hatred for the stereotypical American family, or perhaps just another example of how out of touch the Hollywood elitists are and have been for decades. This is their perception of fly-over country, the people with whom they never have to speak or befriend while flying between Los Angeles and New York, and of the suburbia in which they have never lived. I can appreciate the artsy way it was handled (for some reason it reminded me of a Napoleon Dynamite type project) but ultimately wound up being just another of Hollywood leftists' attempt at socking it to American values they loathe just so that those in the same little bubble with whom they live and socialize can award them the Oscar. Wow, what a surprise!"
"Nothinggrandproductions","10","2","5","26 October 2013"," An ambitious film that pays off in every way
","It's hard to put into words what the meaning of American Beauty is. It is about a lot of things. Multiple themes and open to interpretation in many ways. Themes of suburban life, the meaning of life, death, pedophilia, the American family, obsession with physical beauty, etc. I find it very rare to find a film that can actually deal with so many themes and not feel like a humongous mess (see films like Prometheus and you'll get what I mean in terms of humongous mess). It has ambition that pays off in nearly every way. I came into this movie with no real expectations, I knew nothing about it and it surprised me. I didn't expect such a sprawling film that managed to deal with so much in just two hours. <br/><br/>Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a middle-aged office worker who hates his job, it opens with his wonderful piece of narration, which typically, I would hate but when it's so well-writtenI just can't hate it. I compare the narration of this film to many of Scorsese's films where it is just so good that I can't hate it or it just doesn't feel cheap or lazy like most narration should. Lester is married to Carolyn (Annette Bening) who is a real-estate broker and wants to be nothing but successful. Jane (Thora Birch) is their daughter and hates her parents with a passion, and has a low self-esteem. Most of this sounds like a stereotypical set-up, nothing really out of the ordinary but it is so far from that. <br/><br/>It just keeps building up with exploration of themes in a unique way especially with the performances from the entire cast, most notably Spacey who delivers each and every line with absolute perfection, whether it be sarcastic, dark, serious, or completely insane, Spacey does it perfectly. The Burnham's family also have a new neighbor, a family of three including Frank Fits (Chris Cooper), his wife, Barbara (Allison Janney), and their teenage son, Ricky (Wes Bentley). Frank is a retired member of the Marine Corps and is a strict man who can't trust his son. Regardless, the catalyst of the plot is when Lester sees Jane's friend, Angela (Mena Suvari) and he becomes obsessive about her, planning aspects of his life around her. <br/><br/>This film is ambitious in the best way possible. Everything feels like it was worth it in the end. You'll leave it thinking, thinking a lot, and not just about a single thing, about many, many, things. It's a film hard to put into words, it's different even if it doesn't seem so at a first glance, if anything, it may seem like something typical but is so far from it. It isn't a film that every person who watches it will have the same interpretation, it'll be subjective to your own life and what you have gone through yourself. For example, as someone who has a serious distaste for suburban life, I love the way it portrays it in a dark, fairly disturbing manner. But, it still has plenty of universal themes that really apply to everyone regardless of the mist of insanity the movie gives off. Overall, this is a sprawling, ambitious, film that has so much to offer just in a total of two hours, it'll leave you with so much just about life in general and on top of that, the ensemble cast is incredible."

"amahlanand","5","2","5","17 June 2012"," The Results of Profound Linearity
","'American Beauty' is weird on more levels than one, filled with peculiar people who deeply intrigue you in their strange ways. The filmmakers do the same in their premise for a film so difficult to categorise in its distinctness. The film is an odd, upbeat satire on conventional suburban life, an allegory for breaking away from the 'trap' of normality. However, the intense analytic view the film begs and the ironic tone that encompasses it should not conceal a lack of something genuinely compelling for the average viewer, there's nothing and nobody to admire or sympathise with and little to remember but convoluted messages. There's an abundance of wit in certain elements, but no action, drama which takes a linear route and subtle humour which owes more to situations and circumstances rather than characters.<br/><br/>The film portrays this thematic focus of 'moving away from the status quo' through its protagonist, the trivial and lonely Lester Burnham who begins the film with the monologue, ""This is my neighbourhood, this is my street, this is my life"" which couldn't be more reflective of the word 'average'. An average family life, average 9-5 lifestyle, a spiteful teenager and a garden loving spouse. Suddenly though, the normality takes a different direction with Lester's uncomfortable infatuation with and fantasies of his daughter's friend, Angela. But, is this really the glorified 'escape' from the routineness of his life? He embraces any chance to break away, juvenile pursuits, these unfeasible obsessions, anything as long as he can envisage himself in a more invigorating realm doing something 'exciting'. He then ensues to have a most untypical mid-life crisis which can be humorous in his deluded, misplaced hopes and desires. He ends up being the catalyst for everyone to break away from the norm and pursue some 'excitement' but it is all just a frivolous exercise. <br/><br/>The aim of the film is to show people acting upon the desire to morph themselves from ordinary to extraordinary but they become abnormal and senseless. The characters are detached from each other and after their initial novelties, become tiresome. The acting was impressive, Kevin Spacey in particular brought his 'rebel' to life extremely diligently, but Lester's life doesn't show him moving away from his unremarkable life in a calculated, sane manner and it just wasn't convincing. <br/><br/>The enduring image from the film is one of a plastic bag floating around, deemed by one of the characters as ""the most beautiful thing I've ever seen"". It means nothing but demonstrates the pretensions of the film to try and mean something truly profound. But people see things uniquely and that is why I neither recommend it nor dissuade you from seeing this. The supposed moral is that normality is a façade. Possibly true, but it won't drive you towards insanity and inanity as it does here."
"classicsoncall","10","2","5","5 February 2012"," ""Never underestimate the power of denial.""
","I've read a number of the pro and con reviews of this movie and in a strange way, both sides of the argument seem to have it right. Perhaps that's the power of the film, it's ability to present opposing viewpoints as if they were two sides of the same coin. Personally, I thought the film was brilliant in it's portrayal of how vapid society has become in it's examination of wealth, success and having to get it right here and right now. That's where the Annette Bening character comes in, as the self-actualizing real estate salesperson measuring success by projecting the appearance of success. Caricaturing that position is her husband's (Kevin Spacey) complete disconnect from reality by blackmailing his employer, quitting his job, and looking for the least possible amount of responsibility in a burger flipping career. Along the way, Lester Burnham entertains grand delusions of buffing up and following through on his mid-life fantasies while those around him, daughter Janie (Thora Birch), Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) and creepy neighbor Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley) all dance to the different drummer in their own lives.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding which side of the fence you come down on, I think that by the time you reach Lester Burnham's age, you've managed to entertain some of the kind of fantasies he has. The responsible ones among us don't carry it any further; the ones who do wind up on the front page of their local newspaper or have their name show up in the police blotter. It's probably irrelevant in the grand scheme of things that Lester himself wound wind up in the obituaries. What the picture does, most of the time uncomfortably, is force the viewer to examine their own life and declare a response to the events on screen. In that regard, I'm drawn to a line by the poet Keats, 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty'. 'American Truth' doesn't seem to have the same ring to it as 'American Beauty', but the sentiment expressed by the film is about the same."

"sarva-micala","5","2","5","26 February 2006"," enjoyable, thought-provoling, but ultimately a failure
","American Beauty is an enjoyable and thought-provoking film. However, when I looked closer (to borrow from the tag-line), what I found was somewhat lacking.<br/><br/>Lester Burnham, is, of course, ""Humbert Learns"". And this is the first failure of the film -- Ball seeks to invoke Nabokov's Lolita, but seems to me to have fundamentally misunderstood it. For while Angela Hayes might as well be Dolores Haze, Lester Burnham is not Humbert Humbert. For where is his Annabel Leigh? For Humbert, his attraction to ""nymphets"" has its origin early in his life and becomes his life-obsession. Lester Burnham's attraction to Angela Hayes seems to come out of nowhere -- we receive no indication that such attractions have been a long-standing difficulty for him, much less an obsession. (The film does not reveal to us any personal history relevant to this question.) And what is it that Humbert must learn?: How he can avoid his descent into monstrousness? Can he redeem his memories of Annabel Leigh? Or must they torture him, and turn him inevitably to wickedness? But it is easy to learn to avoid the fall when you lack the tragic flaw. It is easy to learn the answer when the question is far simpler.<br/><br/>Although Lester Burnham is definitely not Humbert Humbert -- he is a far less complex character -- he is in some ways Willy Loman. And yet, here again I feel the film fails, not this time in its premises but in its conclusion. As far as I can understand it, in this film, Willy Loman learns by smoking weed, screwing over his boss, quiting his job, buying a car, getting a slacker job, slobbering over teenage girls, and having his drug dealer teach him some vaguely pantheist philosophy. Is that what Willy Loman needs to learn? Is that what Willy Loman did wrong? Lester Burnham ends up dead anyway, but we are supposed to believe that his life was in the end a success rather than a failure? Is this success? Willy Loman, like Humbert Humbert, is a question -- the question of Humbert Humbert they fail to understand; the question of Willy Loman, they attempt to answer, but the answer to me at least seems unsatisfactory."

","At first while watching American Beauty it seems like it could be a truly good film. However, despite good cinematography, acting, and OK plot, this film lacks something unforgivable - a good story.<br/><br/>The story is pretending to be inspiring and thought provoking. What we see is Kevin Spacey trying to rebel against the rigid society he lives in. And by trying to be different he's just more of the same. This is where the film fails. In today's society, rebelliousness is confused with true originality, and this film makes the same mistake.<br/><br/>The main character is rebelling against the alienation and out of balance value system that everyone adopted. That's a decent intro to a potentially good story. But that's where it all ends too. We don't see any kind of growth on his part, with the exception of the last few seconds of the film (when he looks at his old family picture - and that's not enough); nor do we see something that would certainly make for a truly great film - a realization that rebelling is NOT the way out of alienated life, but a way to stay in it (while unfortunately thinking that something good was done about it). Drugs, sexy girls/wives, dream cars no matter how extreme and ""different"", have never brought true happiness to anyone; they are cheap substitutes for something essential. But in American Beauty that rebelliousness is shown as a solution for our hero.<br/><br/>The film may give those who are just as alienated and rebellious something to identify with; others will be disappointed with the story that seems like it will have some depth, but stays within conformistic boundaries of today's society and makes no progress.<br/><br/>All in all there was nothing great about this film, only a disappointment that there was nothing original about any of the characters - they are living their limited little lives thinking that they are different when they are not. This film also pretends to be different when it is not.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey just being himself doesn't really give a special performance; OTOH, Annette Bening is excellent.<br/><br/>Hardly a 4/10 (only because of Annette Bening and good cinematography)."

","I was greatly troubled this past week when thinking back over the movies so far this year.  I knew none of my favorite films would get any kind of quality Academy recognition, like Director, Picture, or any of the acting categories.  My four favorite films, The Matrix, Go, South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut, and The Sixth Sense, are sure to be virtually shunned of Oscars except for the possible script nomination for either Go or Sixth Sense, and the virtual lock on special effects for The Matrix.  No one can really explain why these films won't get awards and nominations, except ""they're not typical Academy material.""  What is Academy material?  American actors speaking in awful British accents while wearing overly exotic clothing.  Maybe the Academy SHOULD make these types of films ""typical Academy material"", because judging by the fact that all four are on IMDb top 250, the general population feels this way as well.  My fifth nominee, which will most likely be Dogma (based on the script), will almost invariably be dismissed from award consideration.  I figured the Academy would give the movie to some god-awful and pointless art film that no one liked anyway, and everyone would be disappointed, like last year.  Then came American Beauty. This film....is spectacular.  There is nothing to compare it to.  A black comedy that succeeds where Happiness and The Ice Storm failed, American Beauty is a tremendous film that may be enough of an Academy film to snag an Oscar, or two or three, or even, say, half a dozen.  It doesn't have any snazzy costumes or whizzing bullets or superb cinematography, but it does have a solid script.  It does have excellent directing.  It does have the performance of a lifetime from Spacey.  I think I'd be satisfied, though, if this took away only Best Picture.  That's really all it needs, because that's the whole point of American Beauty.  It's not an epic, or heart-wrenching drama, it's a film that asks you to.....look closer."

You're watching all these people's secret lives and it's so tawdry: a love affair, a company downsizing, and a teenager smoking pot.......?
The climax happens, finally, in the last fifteen minutes, and doesn't make much sense to me. Whoever wrote this screenplay really needed an English professor reading over his shoulder asking what the characters' motivations were. WACK AF.<br/><br/>Barring the really weird Lolita overtones, the movie itself seems like a film school's senior project. Couple the narration from the grave with the overall message (""look closer"" at people's seemingly picture-perfect lives), and you have a wholly unimpressive film.
Two of the principle characters, Jane and Ricky, were flatter than a board, and two of the minor characters, Buddy and Ricky's mom, were flatter than them! A waste of Alison Janney, imo. Not to mention Peter Gallagher. Smh so sad.<br/><br/>I didn't get why Jane hates her father so much, except inasmuch as any suburban white teenage girl ""hates"" her life; and Ricky was effing creepy, always filming people and varying his facial expression between empty and on the verge of crying.

","A 90's classic? A beginners' luck masterpiece? or an over-hyped noisy shell? Much like the pseudo cult movies of today's internet era, American Beauty's message and strength fades quickly as the viewer scrutinizes the choices made by the director, specially concerning characterization. The use of character stereotypes as a plot tool slowly descends into a way of dumbing down the 'cult' message, appealing to broader audiences that wouldn't understand a higher level of finesse. Every single character in the movie is a stereotype. Lester is the typical middle-life crisis man, the daughter is the typical parents-hating entitled teen, the gay couple and the army homophobe are, well, exactly what they sound. No one ever surprises you. The depictions are so uninspired and shallow that I caught myself waiting for a sudden turn of events to reveal the real face of a character, to uncover someone interesting. It never happened. Even the subliminal messages are everything but subtle. The 'American Beauty' red roses, the 'Look Closer' sign, the homoerotic undertones at the Fits' family, the staging of all main characters as suspects in Lester's death. Cheap symbolisms and loud noises all around.<br/><br/>You can pinpoint a directional failure when the entire movie can be understood without you even seeing it - try hearing American Beauty with your eyes shut. It's completely comprehensible. Nothing of plot importance happens without narration or heavy dialogue. What's the need of your expensive attention? That's extra crippling in a movie that stumbles around people's notion of beauty. In the end, American Beauty is a mediocre movie that tries too much - and fails stupendously - at being great. There's nothing left to the viewers interpretation. There's no whispered message. Everything's screamed. Maybe that's the 'American' part of it, the need to shout in order to be heard. The 'beauty' part is, well, not so clear. The film's final message is obvious though, between the lines of the final shot, when a small delicacy leaks through the rough fabric of the clichÃ© interactions: never underestimate the power of subtlety."

","""American Beauty"" earned five Oscars--including the biggie for Best Picture. However, I can't help but think that it just couldn't live up this hype when I watched it. Perhaps the competition just wasn't that great, but I can think of a lot of films that should have won this many awards but didn't. Perhaps you don't agree...and hey, that's life.<br/><br/>The film is about a group of people who 100% screwed up and disaffected in their suburban lives. I am sure that is THE theme--how bankrupt life can be behind the stale walls of suburbia. The father (Kevin Spacey) is having a HUGE mid-life crisis. That's not too abnormal, but his reaction sure is--as he quits his job, buys a muscle car, smokes pot, insults his vacuous wife and begins having sexual urges about one of his daughter's underage friends. The wife (Annette Benning) is a frigid lady whose only interest is money and prestige...until she decides to have an affair. The daughter (Thora Birch) appears to be a disaffected teen--which is normal enough until she falls for a creepy guy and begs him to kill her father! Add to this all their 100% screwed up friends--stalkers, murderers, homophobes and nymphettes. None of them are the least bit likable and for me this was THE big problem I had with the film. You cannot connect with the characters because they are so one-dimensional--like caricatures of what's wrong with the American family.<br/><br/>Now, this being said, the film sure is original. And, the acting and direction were all very good. And, it certainly is a provocative film--and it will make you think. And, considering how many hollow and vacuous films there are coming out of Hollywood these days, it does make me appreciate the freshness of the film's plot...even if it's so darn unpleasant and a bit depraved--and a lot like watching a slow-motion train wreck.<br/><br/>By the way, most taboos are broken in this film, so it's not one to show kids or mother-in-laws. Pedophilia is just one of the many icky topics covered in this unique film."

"MovieAddict2016","8","2","6","21 June 2004"," An ode to middle age and life and beauty and...
","My original comment was never approved by IMDb, perhaps because it was over 1,000 words (the maximum), so I will keep this much shorter.<br/><br/>""American Beauty"" is billed as a comedy but it is really more of a tender look at American life, through the eyes of a middle-aged man named Lester (played expertly by Kevin Spacey). The film seems to be popular with younger crowds, although it is even more relevant to older viewers, as its ""hero"" of sorts is 40 years old and begins to see life in a new way.<br/><br/>He starts to get buff, hoping to win the heart of his daughter's (Thora Birch) pretty cheerleader friend (Mena Suvari), pretty much gives up in life, quits his job, lets his wife (Annette Benning) have an affair with a rich real estate agent, etc., etc. It's quite funny but also reveals a fundamental truth about suburban America, surprisingly realized by British director Sam Mendes (husband of Kate Winslet - at least for now).<br/><br/>Mendes directed the superior ""Road to Perdition,"" a film about a gangster (Tom Hanks) who embarks on a road trip with his young son after the boy's mother and brother are both murdered. I felt that ""Road to Perdition"" was better for a few reasons, although both are amazing films, and ""American Beauty"" is still a fine slice of Americana. Don't confuse it with ""American Pie"" - it's wholly different.<br/><br/>The atmosphere evoked is brilliant - the musical score, though strangely similar to that of ""Road to Perdition,"" is wonderful. You may recognize that the film approaches life and death much in the same way as HBO's TV show ""Six Feet Under"" - probably because that show was started by the writer of ""American Beauty,"" who seems to hold a fascination with life and death, providing some beautiful scenes, such as when a teenager stares into the eyes of a dead man and claims to see God staring back at him.<br/><br/>This is an overrated film in my opinion, not as good as some other films I've seen, but it is one of the finest of the past decade and a beautiful experience unlike any you'll ever see.<br/><br/>As the tagline says: Look Closer..."

There were so many better movies that year that should have won an oscar, or even the best picture,(American Psycho, Dogma,Fight Club). Not much can be said about the acting. Kevin Spacey's skeptical portrayal was overrated it didn't deserve the oscar. The rest of the acting was bland, basic and with bad range. Annette Bening was probably the only good actress, although Geena Davis or Madaleine Stowe would also have done well for the part.

This is not a movie ""artistically depicting the trauma of modern life"" in as much as a horrible piece of filmwork that never should have hit the big screen.  While the actors did a fantastic job playing their parts, the plot was lukewarm at best.  A movie that was cornerstoned on sex, it jumped on every opportunity (and some that didn't even present themselves) to show scenes of an unnecessarily graphic nature.  It depicted a ""modern family"" to be one of total disfunction.  I can't stress enough how disgusted I was having seen this movie after all the hype it received.

The only thing that was worth noticing was the acting, which was above average but the story line was seriously flawed and in other words, excuse me, but it sucked.  It's just gross that Lester wants to lay a 16 year old girl...I wonder where they come up with this *BEEP*...it's pedophile and revolting.<br/><br/>And the part of the anti-gay military dude...well that's just politically incorrect because it no movie should there be such a topic. Until we learn to accept homosexuals into our community as regular people, we could just as well be living in the medeivel era.  I mean, you don't see people making ""black"" comments anymore in movies, why do they have to insist with the ""gay jokes"" and all the little nicknames that they have for people that solely have a different sexual orientation? I don;t think that for the people concerned all the ""fag"" comments were very much appreciated. They could have been avoided easily.<br/><br/>Then I was just too weirded out by the horny father...that is just really repulsive and I don't know how a movie plot could be based on such a taboo topic. It's nauseating.<br/><br/>And then American Beauty encourages everything that we DON'T need in our country. I mean, tv stations don't drugs to be seen on tv shows ect ect but then here is this 40yr old perve who buys scat from an 18yr old drug dealer. And then he proclaims him his hero. Nice. Is this the picture that we want to send out to today's teens?  That we should worship druggies? Oh, lovely. Very appealing. And the american stations now censor everything. Well this moves should just be one big censor. It has nothing positive about it. It says that people would rather die than live. And it's just not fun. It has a sick sense of humor.<br/><br/>This is just my opinion, but since this movie has apparently appealed to various genre of people, than maybe there is something that I missed. For the sake of the American public, I hope it's a fault of mine because if we were nominated THIS for an Oscar, then we have a very sick sense of humor and the average American is degenerating monumentally."
"tfrizzell","Null","2","6","25 June 2000"," The Only Bright Spot in a Dark Year for Movies
","""American Beauty"" is far from being a masterpiece.  It's not even an excellent film, but it is very good.  The film centers around Kevin Spacey (in an Oscar-winning performance)who plays a man who is experiencing a mid-life crisis.  After meeting his teenage daughter's girlfriend, Spacey goes through an extreme transformation that will effect all those closest to him.  Annette Bening (in an Oscar-nominated role) is almost as good as Spacey, playing his real estate-selling wife.  However, the other actors fall far short of Spacey and Bening.  Chris Cooper, Mena Suvari, and Thora Birch do nothing special in my opinion.  Wes Bentley is also just adequate. The screenplay is excellent and the direction is pretty good by first-time film maker Sam Mendes.  Any other year, ""American Beauty"" would not have gotten any serious consideration for a Best Picture Oscar.  However, its impeccable timing and its lack of competition made it a runaway winner that captured five Academy Awards in 1999.  4.5 out of 5 stars."

I could not take Spacey seriously as a character- why did he start smoking pot and working out, suddenly? Why is the wife unhappy and if they are unhappy than why not get a divorce? Despite 1999 being one of the best year for American Cinema I can't believe this one won all the awards and accolades.

","American beauty is a film that's not for everyone, some will not get it or just think it makes no sense. But I found it to be a very well made movie that has a good bit to say. First of all, Kevin spacey gives a very powerful yet seemingly effortless performance. And Annette Benning, oh wow how the he'll did she not pick up the Oscar along with Kevin. Benning seems like a sort of Stepford wife kind of character at first, but you soon find out that she is hiding a whole lot underneath. I love the scene where Carolyn is trying desperately to sell a house and she runs out of luck at the end of the day and starts crying then slapping herself repeatedly saying ""you baby!"" and ""weak!"". That in my opinion is a crucial scene when it comes to Carolyn's character development and giving the audience a deep look inside of her. I was thoroughly impressed with thora Birch's performance too, haven't seen anything from her other than the underrated Disney classic hocus pocus. Chris Cooper is great as the horribly prejudice overly tough ex marine father of Wes Bentley, who also turns in a fine very mature performance. Cooper's is an incredibly sad example a closeted gay man who won't accept his own sexuality and in turn is extremely anti gay towards everyone and takes out his anger and frustration on his eighteen year old son. The movie does a wonderful job at telling the complex stories of each and every character and they all intertwine very well. I adored the cast, how the cast portrayed their characters and the clever writing. Well deserving of best picture!"

","I doubt by now many people haven't seen American Beauty by now. There is so much I love about this movie. It tells the story of the Burnham family who are dysfunctional. Lester is not happy in any aspect of his life and his wife, Carolyn, who is a Realtor pretends everything is fine. Their daughter Jane is a typical high school girl who keeps a lot to herself. After Lester meets Jane's friend Angela his life changes. Jane's life also changes when she meets Ricky the new next door neighbor. As the film goes on you see Lester change and become more confident and more assertive to his wife and daughter. I love how the film touches on problems that every family could face but does it in away that makes you want to keep on watching. I think the soundtrack had a big part to do with it for example the music that plays when they watch Ricky's video of the plastic bag. Although the end of the film is quite sad, I think in a way Lester died happy because before it happened Angela asked him how he was and he said ' I'm great'. It's definitely a film that looks at the darker side of family life in suburban America. If you haven't seen it by now then please do, you won't regret it!"

","If you have a family that you live with, briefly think about your home life. Now see if it doesn't to some extent resemble the pathetic family life of the Burnham's or their neighbors. I know mine does. When someone asks you how your day was, how often do you give them a straight answer? Yeah, everything's fine. You've got a steady job, a few dollars in the bank, you're not hungry, and the parents don't beat the kids, and your life's just frickin' lovely. Except that it's not. Because you hate your job or you feel insecure at school, and whenever your mom or dad or kid makes an attempt to ""take an active interest"" in you, it results in nothing more than a facade of fake smiles. <br/><br/>This is what I loved about this movie: the fabulous portrayal of how sad the characters' lives are. The first act in particular is great, showing all of the characters' issues and insecurities. It's funny, but it's also terrible. Seeing Lester fantasizing about Angela as his wife sits right next to him and seeing Carolyn invest so much energy into selling the house at the beginning was so powerful in showing how empty their lives have become. So when the Burnham's started taking some action in the second act, I felt happy for them. It gives them some measure of power over the things that make their lives miserable.<br/><br/>Aside from being an excellent commentary, it was fun to watch. Much like Fight Club, which ironically came out just two weeks after American Beauty, it takes normal people in relatively normal settings and gives them snappy but believable dialogue. I was never bored while watching it either, which shows that it has good pace. Not all of the acting is spectacular, but all of it is good and all of the characters feel realistic and alive. Most of all, though, it evoked an emotional response. There were many times when the scene at hand made me cringe. This may not sound appealing, but it is actually one of the main reasons I would recommend watching it.<br/><br/>To be honest, I can't think of a good reason for anyone over the age of 16 to not watch this movie. If you don't like it, that's one thing. But if you haven't seen it, I strongly urge you to make it a priority because it will put your life into a different perspective. Not only that, it is entertaining to watch in a rather unique way. Overall Rating: 8.5/10."

A hidden theme which I think movie is trying to give is, the violence and hatred towards homosexuals. Just a classic movie, like none other. The plot of the movie is more beautifully acted than written. Also the low parenting skills are shown here, and how teenagers behave when not given proper guidance. The family comes prior to anything else is beautifully taught. A middle age couple around 40 also needs to have his/her sexual needs satisfied.

","To start this off, I truly believe it is a 10/10 movie--it's my favorite movie of 1999 (the year it was made) and my favorite movie of all time. My review will not be biased, so please continue reading.<br/><br/>The plot: a man in his early 40s (played by the amazing Kevin Spacey) is possibly the most average man of his age that you could think of; he lives in a suburban house with his wife and teenage daughter, to whom, do not care much for him nearly as much as they used to. Lester Burnham, the 42-year-old main character, works as a sales agent, where he has worked for the past 15 years. Lester is simply tired and bored of his life, and wants more--he wants a wife who is willing to please him sexually, a daughter that loves him, and a job that's flourishing with excitement and overall, much different from the one he has now. His wife is a real-estate agent who seems to care more for her competitor, the Real Estate King, more than him. After going to his daughter Janie's cheerleading event, he spots her friend--Angela Hayes- -the girl who is exactly what Lester needs in his life; he falls in love once again, this time to a teenage girl who claims to be a sex-crazed person with aspirations of being a model. In hopes of revving his inner-self, he develops an obsession for the girl.<br/><br/>Okay...so why is this so good? Well, first of all, Lester Burnham's words are like poetry--his monologues emphasize how you must get the best of life before it's over--after all, it could abruptly end tomorrow--it doesn't matter when you read this, the sad truth is that you could die whenever. The atmosphere in the film is marvelous; it shows how everyone has their strengths and their inner-weaknesses; it also depicted just what makes a person happy, and how that affects everyone else around them. It really is a gem of a film, both inspiring the audience whenever possible, and allowing them to laugh at the relatable truth about life and human-beings.<br/><br/>I'm not telling you to go watch it--but you should. Even if it doesn't change your life forever, you'd honestly be entertained for the entire 2-hour movie."
"fschafrothdoty","9","1","2","7 November 2016"," American Beauty - A Critique of the American Dream Using Conrad Hall's Cinematography
","American Beauty is a film dripping with character. Following primarily the life of the average American middle class suburban worker Lester Burnham, we get to know a whole host of characters. Lester is married to Carolyn, and their daughter Jane is friends with a girl named Angela, but also befriends the neighbor boy Ricky who just moved in nextdoor. The film itself can be interpreted as a critique of the traditional American dream, a somber and warped view of what is usually the goal of most Americans. Lester goes about his day depressed with his family standing because, while he has a wife and daughter, his love life is nonexistent and his relationship with his daughter is absent, leading to a lack of respect among the family members. He becomes enamored with Jane's friend Angela, a girl far too young for him, and a far cry from the normal love interest in a film about the American dream.<br/><br/>The 90s were a time filled with anxiety about the meaning of life. While earlier decades were dedicated to certain clichÃ©s like the teenage rebel, classic nerd boy, or upstanding middle class citizen, the 90s abandoned all rules and regulations. The American dream was stripped to the core and analyzed, and in American Beauty it's put on display from the start as a soul sucking path down which Lester mindlessly ambles. He finds himself in a loveless marriage, and can't seem to connect with his daughter. The first moment he seems to feel something outside of the bland norm is when he becomes enamored with Angela. He also begins to loosen up about his work when he starts smoking pot with Ricky. These two inciting character developments cause him to stray from his monotonous, droning life, and question the traditional American dream. He isn't happy with the traditional monogamous love life, so he lusts after a younger girl, and he isn't happy with his secure but mind- bogglingly boring job, so he smokes pot and cares much less about work.<br/><br/>The first Lester sees of Angela is lit in stark opposition to the rest of the film with a spotlight, and the rest of the gymnasium literally fades away as he immediately lusts after her. The first Lester sees of Ricky is a surprisingly quick request to ""party,"" followed by a smoke break outside with just the two of them. Wides are reserved for only the most necessary and impactful shots, and both of these incidents are shot with wide lenses. This deviation from the norm of mid to telephoto is indication of a literal deviation in the character's life choices.<br/><br/>Although the film is in color, large swaths of the image are often desaturated in tone both in-camera and through color grading. The first huge use of color we notice are Angela's rose petals. After that we begin to notice a pattern: the traditional American dream is desaturated, almost like their idealized white picket fences, whereas the new and meaningful endeavors in life like younger girls and smoking pot are accentuated by color. The lust after Angela is represented in red, whereas the use of marijuana is often accented with rainbows, especially seen in the background of Lester's garage. Deviations from the traditional American dream are indicated using color, and almost rewarded with a splash of saturation in an otherwise dull world.<br/><br/>In general, the cinematography of American Beauty is very purposeful. The lighting is, for the most part, practical or hyper- realistic, and serves to beautify the subject(s). Because it is kept to this norm, when it changes it obviously means something (think Angela's cheerleading routine, with the spotlight). The same is the case for the positioning and movement of the camera. When something other than the still or purposefully maneuvered mid to telephoto shot is used, we pay attention (think about the extremely wide shot of Lester speaking with his boss for the first time). Conrad Hall, the DP, intentionally maintained a theme and system to his shooting and lighting, and deviated from it to punctuate his storytelling. While some of Hall's signature shots like the ""liner"" or slash light, intense hair light, and soft three quarters to split face lighting are used, this is very much a film with its own visual grammar. We know what we are to expect, because Hall sticks to it almost all of the time. When he doesn't we see and we take note of how and why.<br/><br/>American Beauty is a critique of the traditional old fashioned American dream. Lester's life embodies everything wrong with that way of living, and his lust and experimentation outside of the confines of the normal are representative of a new way of life. This change to something new and different is accentuated using color, lighting, camera movement and composition, among other cinematography tools. Hall creates a style for the film, based off of his own, and deviates from it to both draw attention to the deviation as well as create a meaning behind it. American Beauty is a breakdown of the American dream, and a suggestion of something new and different to aspire to instead. The cinematography goes hand in hand: a traditional, ordinary style, interrupted by a suggestion of what could be."

","A focused look into the nature of life, American Beauty takes the suburban caricatures and weaves a tale of metaphorical and symbolical greatness. It stares into the depths of hidden nature and gleams the beauty in life.<br/><br/>The screenplay, criticized by many for its banality, is truly an original blend that utilizes those ""cliche"" characters to tell a gallant story. They are merely plot devices to get across the beautiful themes and messages. And the metaphors and symbols combine in testament to the depth of the film that parallels the depth of life. The acting, which seems at first to only be average, is actually stellar, as each actor takes their caricature, embodies it, and makes their character real. Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham, who spectacularly catalyzes the film, portrays his character's sporadic nature as simply believable, and Wes Bentley's oration as Ricky Fits binds the entire film together. The cinematography is brilliant, in that it isolates the events of unique importance, paints life in separated light by using jagged scenes, and uses unique lighting similar to the uniqueness of life. The directing drives the entire film to a complete believability, which in the spirit of a message about the nature of life is necessary, yet is almost impossible in fiction.<br/><br/>The plot comes to a beautiful parallelism through the metaphor and the character development. As the true nature of each character comes to light, the nature of life doesn't resist the flow. Passion and coldness; nature and guise; and life and death come to a collision in this film. Yet it also discusses whether the nature of life or the guise that hides it is truly beautiful.<br/><br/>American Beauty is beautiful on all its levels and is executed to a chilling perfection causing the viewer to be driven to a true collision of parallel ideas.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Sam Mendes' ""American Beauty"" is a strange movie but one that is interesting and relatable and has an interesting way of looking at its characters in a relatable and human way lead by an incredible performance from Kevin Spacey. Spacey just eats this character up he makes him human and sympathetic, every time he's punched around by his family or just life in general Spacey pulls it of with class and defiantly earned his Oscar for this movie. Annette Benning was also great in this film she completely sinks herself into the character of this horrible and cruel wife while I do have some problems with her character Bennings performance is not one of them. I have seen very little of Wes Bentley but he blew me away in this movie I loved his character he at first comes off as an outsider but you come to realise that he has the freedom that very few others do and in a way come to envy him. I love Chris Cooper but I had no idea he was capable of giving such a terrifying performance he's so good in this film and his character arc is such a delight to watch, you come to understand why he is the way he is and come to feel as much sympathy for him than you do for Spacey. Everyone in this movie has a compelling character arc that always gives its characters something to do. Spaceys arc was easily the films best it's just encases everything that anyone would ever want to do if they just let go of the what's expected of him. The way this movie looks at suburban American is done just right it's not done in an insulting way but in an eye opening way, we are able to see how it can tie people down and limits their capabilities. Every decision made by a character in this film makes sense, no matter how bad the choices may be we get why they make them even the eventual murder of Spaceys character is done in an understandable way. However I do have a few problems with this movie for one every character was understandable except for Bennings she just was a horrible person and we never really understood why, she's clearly The one to blame for the bad marriage and they should have devoted more time to build her character up more. I didn't mind the fact that Spaceys character dies in the end but I really wish that they had left it open ended, like me have to guess which one character was responsible for the murder and would have warranted more repeat viewings and made the film all the more compelling. <br/><br/>American Beauty is such a great film it's got a beautiful (pun intended) of handling its characters and themes it's directed and edited beautifully and there is no other movie like it. <br/><br/>86%/A-"

","American beauty is a film about an everyday man lester (Spacey) going for a drastic midlife crisis as his normal life has become too regular and mundane. As the film goes on we see Lester change drastically from an up tight office worker to a laid back care free stoner. This effects all the people around him and it was an amazing piece of cinema to see the changes progress throughout the film. This is by far Kevin Spacey's finest hour and he delivers with an absolute stellar performance.

","Every single time I come across with American Beauty I just stop any and every thing I'm doing to appreciate one more time, for the billionth time, this eternal masterpiece. It's just one of those movies that you learn so much from, that every time you watch it you feel like you just found something that wasn't there the last time you saw it, either the subtle irony in some Kevin Spacey line or that hilarious hidden scowl in Annette Benning's Carolyn. Those two are definitely worth watching forever. The plot couldn't be simpler: A seemingly typical American family goes through some rough times as the daughter Jane (Thora Birch) goes through adolescence and the father Lester (stunning stunning stunning Kevin Spacey) becomes increasingly less attracted to his wife, and true 'family guy', Carolyn, played by Benning, who if there was any justice in the world, would've won that Oscar. The Burnhams were happy once, so it looks, but as time went by they lost the passion, the joy, and became 3 individuals who share a house and a dinner table (watch out for that scene, too good to be true). Turning point? Ricky and his family arrive to the neighborhood, and Lester develops a crush on Jane's cheer leading mate Angela (Mena Suvari in her best, ever). You never get very fond of Ricky, but I guess that's what Wes Bentley wanted, brilliantly playing this weird, eerie misfit who has an obsession with Jane. It sounds pretty boring, right? But it's not, really. Slowly, everything starts to crumble, as the characters strive to achieve some happiness in their dull lives. From Ricky's homophobic dad to Carolyn herself, every single one of them wants something they're not getting, and it's writer Alan Ball we should thank to for such a flawless depiction of ordinary misery and unhappiness. The 5 Oscars speak for themselves, this is a triumph in every single aspect. It makes you laugh until you cry but it also makes you feel this weird fear that your life will turn into this one day. For all that matters, it's Sam Mendes's masterpiece, and a perfect example of how cinema can get inside your head. It's the story of the pursuit of happiness in an American neighborhood. Eternal."

","Never has a movie been so difficult for me, personally, to understand in full length. Normally with a film; I point out the positives and the negatives but I am willing to make an attempt to explain the motif and the ever so influential symbol of the rose.<br/><br/>American Beauty balances the personal tragedies in the minds of individuals with the evident satire of a regular depressed American family in the backdrop of the late 1990s. As you progress through the film you suddenly realize that each character is struggling with their own personal debacle with themselves. This could be as simple as harboring the insecurities that tag along with teenage angst (Jane Turnham) to creating a false image of yourself as a burly ""man"" battling with his sexuality (Frank Fits).<br/><br/>The true meaning of beauty in this film is the realization of the small things in the characters' lives that make them who they really are. When Lester Dunham finally comes to terms with everything going on in the time of his mid-life crisis; he recognizes that everything that he wanted (besides freedom from his corporate job) was already in his life, but he had just merely skipped over it in the craze of everything. He finally finds his happiness in the end when he sees this which allows him to locate his own oasis of peace and tranquility before his death. <br/><br/>The story-line following Lester's development is clearly the most important to the plot of the movie itself, but none of his advancements would have been made without Ricky Fits, the strange boy with the split persona, and his ability to force emancipation upon himself so that he did not suffer through what he didn't wish to. The fact that Ricky basically held the answer to all of the characters' problems in the story is also critical to remember. He stated that ""there is so much beauty in the world"". This isn't discovered by the main protagonists until later in the film where they identify that trying to alter their ways would not find them the beauty in their lives that they had forgotten and skimmed over prior to the lapse of attentiveness. <br/><br/>The realization that I came to, embarrassingly enough, was that the title of the film itself was not focusing on the beauty of Angela Hayes and the obsession Lester had with her during his mid-life crisis, but with the beauty that lies within everything the protagonists already have. The forced personality change that many of them experience is practically the same as not even containing a personality within themselves. This movie focuses more on the theme than anything else which is what makes it so magnificent. Even the original score and the lighting and camera angles add a feeling of simplicity to the problem that shouldn't have existed in the first place. <br/><br/>Overall, American Beauty and it's performances by Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, and Wes Bentley were inexplicably amazing and the film indubitably earned the world renown Best Picture Oscar.<br/><br/>Remember, Look Closer"

","American Beauty | 1999 | Directed by Sam Mendes | Starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening and Thora Birch | <br/><br/>Sam Mendes's American Beauty is one of those movies in which everything ;acting, direction and editing come together to give the viewer a memorable cinematic experience which is both captivating and intellectually stimulating, leaving the viewer with a bittersweet aftertaste .<br/><br/>The film begins with a voice over of Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham( Kevin Spacey) narrating the story of the last year of his life (presumably) just before his death . He is a meek submissive writer for a magazine who hates his job and grudgingly goes through the daily<br/><br/>grind . He is married to Carolyn, an ambitious real estate agent who is obsessed with success and self-improvement. Their daughter Jane is the angry, insecure teenager archetype who hates them , finding her father a ""loser"" and her mother controlling. <br/><br/>Their family exemplifies the dysfunctional suburban family. It's a perfect setting for a midlife crises ,which precipitates when Lester develops an infatuation for his daughter's friend Angela. This leads to a series of events culminating to a finale with life changing events for and revelations about the main characters.<br/><br/>The movie deals with the themes of alienation and the human condition in an increasingly hostile world. Lester's journey of self discovery is message that even when all hope is lost , it's never too late to start being true to oneself . His transformation from a submissive ""Nice Guy"" to an assertive man unafraid to speak his mind and bend the ""Rules"" is drastic , still it is made to seem natural through Kevin Spacey's performance which deservedly earned him an Academy Award.<br/><br/>The other characters are equally complex and their story arcs revolve around the similar theme of self-deception, alienation and ultimately self-discovery and acceptance . Carolyn Lester represents the dark side of the American notion of basing your self worth on material success . Jane finds a unlikely lover in their next door neighbor Ricky who obsessively follows her around and videotapes her every move. Initially uncomfortable , she warms up to him being alienated from her parents and now her friend, whose constant flirting with Lester bothers her .<br/><br/>Daydreams of Lester's fantasies of Angela are executed brilliantly with surreal visuals accompanied by haunting music. A recurring motif in these scenes are the red rose petals , which also are featured in the iconic poster of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall it puts to display the predicaments of modern life, how youthful optimism gives away to lethargic passivity, how self-denial and conformity slowly eats away self-esteem , how the mindless pursuit of success leads you down a dark path and how even after this, there is hope for redemption and finding ""beauty"" in life."

","I'm gonna be honest here, I clicked this movie on Netflix mostly expecting to get a laugh out of it. (A suburban dad crushing on a teenager? You're in for something interesting.) But surprisingly, this movie has some more substance to it. I kept hearing the film title but I never knew that it won Oscars, until recently. Those Oscars are well- deserved. ""American Beauty"" seemed to question the definition of ""beauty,"" I think. One guy might find an empty plastic bag beautiful, while a middle aged father finds a blonde cheerleader-type teen girl beautiful. And the movie questions a lot of other cultural stuff as well, and it definitely takes a stab at the stereotypes of suburban family life, which I really liked. The film's portrayal of suburban family life was pretty authentic, and many of the issues that the family tackled were relatable. Overall, great movie! It lost a star only cause some parts kinda grossed me out, but it's not too bad, mostly."

","The plot is, a middle-aged suburban father named Lester (Kevin Spacey) feels apathetic and depressed until falling in love with his daughter's best friend.<br/><br/>American Beauty is directed by Sam Mendes and written by creator of Six Feet Under, Alan Ball. And while the directing of the movie is impressive and not to be ignored, it's in the story and writing where American Beauty shines through as a modern classic.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is great. The performances are all fantastic and make up one of the better ensemble casts I've seen. Everyone gets their moments to shine. The cinematography is well- done, almost always subtly doing something that is meant to communicate information about the characters. Whether that be a zoom to show two characters connecting, a red-colored object to show a characters feelings, or changing the size of something in the frame to show it's shifting importance. The score by Thomas Newman is absolutely fantastic, debatably his best score he's ever done. Its varied, fitting, unique, and very memorable. <br/><br/>Now for the star of the show, the screenplay. Virtually every single character is realistic, relatable, flawed, and likable. The best part about it is, despite being distinct and well-rounded characters, none of them are really unusual. I see people around me displaying these characteristics every day. There are points where a character will be describing their thoughts and feelings, and I will think ""how does this movie know what I'm thinking?"". There are points where the movie seems to know what I'm thinking by openly subverting my expectations for the story, without becoming stupid or unrealistic. This movie is able to capture the feelings and thoughts of a wide variety of people at vital points in their lives that anyone who has gone through them should be able to understand. <br/><br/>American Beauty is funny, dramatic, intelligent, original , and it's something of a crowdpleaser! I would highly recommend seeing American Beauty as soon as possible."

","I'm not just blind. I agree with the masses that the paper bag thing was full of crap. But that is the film's one and only flaw.<br/><br/>The performances instantly stand out, on both Spacey and Benning's part. Kevin Spacey, in particular, gives what is truly one of the greatest performances in film history, suiting for the single most dramatic mid-life crisis in fiction or real life, ever. It killed him. Mid-life crises don't usually do that. <br/><br/>The writing is also monumental. You could give one great quote from this movie a day and go on for months without ever re-using one. From the classic ""Smile, you're at Mr. Smiley's!"" to ""Pass the asparagus,"" to ""Well at least I'm not ugly,"" this may be the most quotable movie ever. And I didn't even scratch the surface.<br/><br/>The directing is also fabulous, with the viewer constantly wondering ""where did they get all those rose petals?"" In fact, the directing is so good that it makes the three young 20-year-olds look like teenagers. From Spacey's outburst about the asparagus, to the five million rose petal scenes, to the introductory and closing sequences and narration, the directing is flawless.<br/><br/>But there are a few things I still have to call BS on.<br/><br/>1. Remember how I said the director made the three adults look like teens? I was lying. It only worked for two of them. The boy is clearly a twenty-three year old. 2. Does Sam Mendes seriously expect me to believe that the beam in the window was in the exact right place to make the father think they were getting a blow job? And the dad never thought to move to the right or left at all? Or notice the perspective was off? And why did Spacey flex there? He's got no one to impress. 3. You don't show your girlfriend your dad's Nazi plate. Not even if you're this guy. 4. Again, the paper bag thing was too pretentious. 5. The five million rose petal scenes. I get that's the theme, just... ease up. 6. Neither Spacey nor the teenager is any good at flirting. Maybe that's on purpose, but... wow. 7. Lester is okay with statutory rape, but not if the kid is a virgin? Seriously?<br/><br/>Anyway, that may seem like a lot of criticism, but the rest of the movie is so utterly flawless, it only takes away one measley star.<br/><br/>In the Top Fifty."

"benatarandres","10","1","2","25 May 2016"," This is the high point of my day.
","Life as embracing as it can be for some, has beauty that is often overlooked, or even denied through the ignorance of the mundane. For a soul as lost as Lester Burham( Spacey), the only happiness he can enjoy starts and ends from whacking off at the crack of dawn. ""This is the high point of my day,"" words that further reveal the very unhappiness of the film's cynical but pitiful protagonist. English stage director Sam Mendes had marked his directorial debut with the making of American Beauty, a Dream Works production, originally written by Alan Ball for the stage, rather than the big screen. The film's tag line, ""Look Closer,"" further coveys the message of looking beyond the simple, and discovering the very beauty behind anything life has to offer.<br/><br/>Lester is 42 years old, married to a materialistic wife Carolyn (Benning), is estranged from his daughter Jane (Birch), and sees himself as a gigantic loser. As Lester narrates his miserable existence with enough apathy to further express his sadness, and as he goes on and on, does he reveal his imminent death to take place in less than a year. As much as a kicker that may be for audiences, the sad part of it all was Lester's place in life, lost, and with very little to look forward to other than the James Bond movie marathon on TNT (very exciting indeed)<br/><br/>Through the erotic dancing of Jane's friend, Angela (Suvari) in her cheer leading uniform, Lester fantasizes and discovers a beauty in life that went far beyond a childish infatuation. From this point on Lester grows braver, more independent, and more self-reflective towards the life he once lived, trying to dispel the hypocrisies that still plague his family. Annett Benning's powerhouse performance of a character as insecure and as depressing as Carolyn ranges from her failures as a real estate agent, as well as the materialism that grips her personality. Her own reluctance to cry is further expressed by her fear of vulnerability, thus ending in self- demeaning motivation. It is through her own epiphany of self- discovery that she finds an even greater thrill for life. In fact, Alan Ball's scripts introduces various characters just as lost, or just as curious as Lester and Carolyn, as they all search for something the suburban lifestyle can't destroy or taint.<br/><br/>Angela never stops bragging about every man she's slept with. The Burham's next door neighbor Colonel Fits (Cooper) enforces his macho demeanor over his delinquent son Ricky (Bentely) in a desperate attempt to block out his own doubts and insecurities. In both his honesty and curiosity towards what is beyond the simplicity of any image, Ricky marvels at the very beauty so many characters search for, but few find.<br/><br/>Materialism, repression, conformity, liberation, and inner growth defined the very message of a film as familiar and yet clearly effective as American Beauty. The portrayal of American suburbia is as honest as it is horrifying to watch in its humorous depiction. It's a life that is seen as pleasant, but with rather dull circumstances that by the time enough people realize it, life has been passing them by tragically. The more positive moments of the film are actually captured in the realm of fantasy that further pushes for a reality beyond the torment most of the characters endure. Conrad Hall's cinematography beautifully captures Lester's erotic fairy tale fantasies, as he descends into happiness, and the purity he has achieved in the conclusion of the film and his life.<br/><br/>In the 15 years since American Beauty's release, it has garnered a reputation far beyond its 8 Oscar nominations as a drama that reaches audiences on both an entertaining as well as a more socially engaging level. The desire to discover true happiness is honest enough from the dramatic and yet equally humorous performances by Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning. Spacey has always had the upper hand in his sarcasm, and Benning matches him in her neurotic tone of expression. Both entertaining and influential, American Beauty marked an era in the film making career of director Sam Mendes as he has gone to direct equally effective dramas, exploring controversial social norms, such as, Road to Perdition, and Revolutionary Road, thus embodying an expression of film making that reveals often deeper and more compelling truths to our flawed society and the traditional norms that cripple it from reaching a liberation it is in desperate need of. The truths within American Beauty go far enough to challenge the notion of life and how sadly limited it is. Human beings fear death, knowing nothing of what is to happen after, if anything of the sort, and instead of valuing the precious time we have, we squander it on measly martial possessions, and binding social institutions, deluding ourselves into thinking it will further define our character. The here and now is all that we have, and the only thing we can truly depend on. American Beauty is an inspiration, if not also a wake up call to enjoy the time we have. Life, one minute you have it, and then it's gone."

","American Beauty (1999): 5 academy awards, recognized all over the world as a great masterpiece, wonderful rating by famous critiques. My expectations were probably too high and that could be one of the reasons that pushes me to say that, in my opinion, other movies should have deserved an Oscar in 2000. The story-line is based on a Married man who fantasizes to sleep with the girl friend of his daughter. The plot alone is quite troubling. Every character seems to be mentally in-stable but it is in fact portrayed all as mid-life crisis.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, there are some wonderful scenes such as the ending one and the philosophical ones which bring out important quotes. In this movie alone there is also a recurrent editing technique which is used to slow down central scenes. This technique focuses on one movement and cuts back and forth to repeat it several times, only after this can the story continue. Additionally, the music by Thomas Newman is fantastic.<br/><br/>Personally, this movie is very similar to Donnie Darko (2001) in terms of mental instability. I do prefer though Richard Kelly's movie to American Beauty. Could it be because it actually teaches the meaning of time and coincidences in life, instead of teaching me how to flirt with a 19 years old girl? You tell."

","Being a big fan of David Lynch, I quite enjoy a movie that is a little ""off"". Having a political science degree, I definitely enjoy a movie that deals with deep issues like society and expectations. Sam Mendes' 1999 Best Picture winner embodies all of the above aspects that I like. About 20 minutes into this film, I was certain I was going to enjoy it. I wasn't wrong.<br/><br/>American Beauty highlights one suburban family's struggle with cultivating the normality that is expected of theirs, and every other family in America. The perfect house and lawn, the successful parents with good jobs, the well-adjusted high school teenager. There is just one problem with this picture--it doesn't exist. Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening) is a real estate agent vying for top spot in her market against a good looking competitor sweeping the field. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) makes a decent living in a job he hates increasingly more with each passing day. Jane Burnham (Thora Birch) is the disillusioned youngest daughter in the house, struggling to fit in at school and eager to start her life. When a run-in with one of Jane's friends sets Lester headlong into a mid- life crisis, each weave of the Burnham family's seemingly perfect life comes unstitched.<br/><br/>The overarching theme of this movie deals with the question, what is normal? The fact is, that answer is different for each individual. We see three different variations of normal just in the Burnham's neighborhood, let alone outside their block. Expecting life to come together into the cookie-cutter image you've expected since you were cognizant of your place in the world just isn't reality. Unfortunately, many people don't understand that false reality and attempt, for far too many years of their life, to create what they've always expected. True liberation comes with learning to be yourself. For that reason alone, you should make time for American Beauty. Oh yeah, and Kevin Spacey."

","The Burnhams; Lester, Carolyn and daughter Jane, seem to be a typical, happy family living in a typical American suburb... of course things aren't as perfect as they outwardly appear. Lester's opening narration tells us that he will be dead within a year but he might as well be dead already. He appears to be having a midlife crisis; he hates his job and is fantasising about his teenaged daughter's friend Angela. Meanwhile Carolyn is also frustrated with her work and has an affair while Jane holds her parents in contempt. They aren't the only less than perfect family in the street; their new neighbour Colonel Fits it a bigot who beats his son Ricky for the slightest reason and Ricky is constantly watching, and filming Jane.<br/><br/>Lester's life changes when he overhears Angela telling Jane that she'd sleep with her father if he toned up a bit. He starts exercising, quits his job and starts smoking dope that he has bought from Ricky. As the film approaches the end there are hints at who might kill Lester but there are several possibilities; Carolyn has started going to a shooting club, Col Fits thinks Lester is involved in a sexual relationship with his son and Jane is telling Ricky she would like it if somebody killed her father.<br/><br/>This is a really good film; it could easily have been excessively melodramatic but a combination of a fine script, excellent direction and a top-notch cast make it engrossing and possible for the viewer to care about characters who are in many ways unsympathetic. Kevin Spacey is on top form as Lester and is ably supported by Annette Benning and Thora Birch as Carolyn and Jane. The story nicely combines moments of comedy with tragedy. Even though the ending is fairly unforgettable the film still stands up to repeat viewings. Overall a top quality film that shows a darker side to apparently ordinary lives."
"SeanB201","10","1","2","20 February 2016"," An Underrated Masterpiece for the Ages
","American Beauty is one of most underrated movies in terms of its ranks among the greats. It is a masterpiece on all levels and has the hardware to show for it, with five Oscars including best picture.<br/><br/>The movies original screenplay written by Alan Ball is a great story about the average middle aged man in America, and how his life takes a turn for the dramatic. Although the primary focus of the film is on the main character, Lester, he does a great job of developing the stories of the other characters such as his wife, daughter and new neighbors. In just the two hours this film is running, one can almost get a perfect sense of all whop all the characters really are. The story brings everyday emotions and issues to the table, including anger, confusion, depression and lust. My favorite quality about the film is that even though it is an original screenplay it feels like it was taken out of a great American novel and projected on the screen, which is a unique quality that i have yet to see in any other film. This is what i believe the director Sam Mendes has done with the film. He projects what seems to be a story with such detail that that it feels like you are imagining the scenes straight from a written source. <br/><br/>The acting in American Beauty is on an elite few films posses. The cast is great all around, but the lead roles of Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening are unforgettable. Kevin Spacey performance as the lead role of Lester is one of the finest examples of acting in this history of cinema. Spacey brings out every emotion out in what is the simple role of a average middle aged man in a way that only he could do. He makes Lester one of the most unique characters one will ever come across, but yet he is not considered to be ""all that special"", this makes the audience connect with the charter on an even deeper level.<br/><br/>With that being said I believe that American Beauty is one of the greatest films ever made. I would consider it to be on a level with films such as The Godfather, Gone With the Wind and Schindler's List. It is one of my personal favorite and is an absolute must- watch film during your lifetime."

","American Beauty is one of the best films of 1999, as well as a film that is near and dear to my heart.This is the story about hopelessness and isolation not just the beauty.Lester and his both are going through mid life crisis and hate each other.His daughter falls in love with a neighbor who has a fetish for voyeurism and death.Lester falls in love with a gorgeous friend of his daughter and fantasize about her.This is not to say that the characters' quests in American Beauty are completely irrelevant to the meaning they find.

"danielhirst","8","1","2","6 August 2015"," Good, but not great, statement on modern America
","American Beauty had such a massive impact on popular art-cinema that at times it seems a bit of a cliché. It has the weird depressed artistic kid, the self-help infatuated business people, the hyper-sexualised blonde girl, the emasculated dad, the evil corporate boss, and the repressed homophobic military man. Yet, I think the feeling of cliché that can affect the viewer of this movie is mostly the result of the influence it had on how the disaffection of modern American culture was portrayed in the television shows and movies that followed rather than due to an inherent flaw in the movie.<br/><br/>This is a movie about the meaninglessness of modern American life. It shows the breakdown of the family unit, where all family members are against each other in a domestic cold-war. Individuals working in companies are treated without respect and do not feel any purpose and hence motivation to perform their job well. Those that do feel passion for their work do so out of a lack of true self-esteem and embrace a self-help, Tony Robbins type culture that comes across as extremely odious to those that see through the mask of professionalism. Youth are depressed and disconnected from their parents; those that have a more creative streak are out casted by materialistis in the school system and readily engage in devious behaviour. Old school Americans feel lost in a system that no longer respects toughness and stoicism but are unable to embrace the emotional and sexual liberalism of the modern world.<br/><br/>American Beauty attempts to capture the malaise of modern America and provides somewhat extreme versions of the different manifestations that this takes. Watching this movie I was struck by the fact that every character in this movie was white and middle-class. In this sense, American Beauty is limited by the fact that it is a presentation of the ills only affecting a small and privileged group within a wealthy, developed country. This fact could be viewed as reflecting the fundamental immaturity of the individuals portrayed as they are not able to enjoy their privilege. On the other hand, suffering is always subjective, and all humans face pain in their own way, framed by the circumstances that shape their lives. It therefore displays the confusion and absurdity of a very specific social class, but does not act as a more robust statement on humanity as a whole.<br/><br/>One key point in American Beauty is the role of sexuality. Individuals are shown to seek refuge from their lives through sex: both fantasy and real. The movie displays the futility of this approach. The fantasy either will not meet our expectations, or will die off into another form of boredom or pain. There is no real redemptive quality to this message: no one seems to transcend it or come to terms with the reality of it. Lester Burnham, played by Kevin Spacey, seems to encounter this head-on later in the movie, but this experience hardly plays an important role in the development of his life or character nor of the movie.<br/><br/>The weakness of the movie lays in its beginning and conclusion, which both involve Lester speaking of his past life as if in some kind of afterlife. This is the narrative technique used, but is not properly incorporated into the rest of the movie or explained. Possibly the movie was saying that the foolishness of life is only fully seen by those that have ceased living, or that there is some kind of religious meaning to all the suffering that plays out in human life. However, it has the feeling of something tacked onto the movie without much reflection on what it is meant to portray.<br/><br/>Finally, the bleakness of the message is made viewer friendly due to the fine work of the director, Sam Mendes. It is shot in a soft, playful and stylistically lush way. The colours are bright and the movie is upbeat. All of this led to the huge popularity of this movie as while presenting a harsh message, American Beauty is an enjoyable, playful and humorous film.<br/><br/>This review is taken from www.amateurreviewspace.blogspot.com"
"Kubris","9","1","2","3 June 2015"," Middle America in a frame
","Few people will be able to completely uproot their lives and begin it again, but that Lester Burnham's journey in American Beauty: he wipes his hands clean of his pitifully ordinary life and lives life how he wants with his own goals. And to see it is thrilling.<br/><br/>Of course there's a little more to it than a hasty decision to turn it around. Several factors converge in this extraordinarily tight drama: Lester discovers his daughter's friend Angela, a 90s Lolita. He also finds his bland job to be on wobbly ground, and lastly he gets new neighbours, a military family with a strange boy, Ricky. These together create a change in the meek Lester and create a magnificent film.<br/><br/>The real question I had after seeing this film was: ""What's wrong with American Beauty?"" and then I couldn't answer my question. I'll start with the most well- known aspect of the film, its acting. The entire cast is sharp as their respective characters. Led by Kevin Spacey as Lester, original Yes Man (""I rule!""), you will find something relateable in at least one of the characters, good or bad. Their personalities and actions are entertaining, their motives are all there, and if a character is intended to be likable, you will like them. It's just as a good film should be: honest and unforced, but with just an edge to help you in the right direction.<br/><br/>I've briefly mentioned how tight American Beauty is. The plot is wonderfully self contained but also organic, it feels very plausible. There's a reason things happened as they did when they did. I can't find any plot holes. Much credit has to be given to the script and writers, and bonus points for being an original idea when so many excellent dramas have ""Based on"" in their credits.<br/><br/>But more than characters, plot and script, American Beauty is also visually wonderful. While much of it is observed as life is, Lester's fantasies have a brilliantly symbolic and colourful side making them stand out as more than dreams. This leads to the deeper aspects of the film, such as recurring symbols, numerous metaphors (the bag...) and of course the moral.<br/><br/>For a film concentrating on failure, I found a very positive message out of the film, and that was to enjoy life and all the beautiful things in it, and to never trap yourself. Like the tag, look closer, find yourself looking past the black and white (into the red?) and see beauty. It all sounds cheesy, but unlike Spacey's later work Pay It Forward, it doesn't come off the screen that way. <br/><br/>From a cynic to seizing the day, American Beauty is a dark film with a big smiley face over it that blends until its climax. An engrossing fiction that for many isn't too far from real life, I think this film can speak to people differently as you age, and that power to draw different meanings from different viewings is a sign of a true film. A full film and a fantastic way to close out a millennium. 9.4/10"

","I saw it for the first time about three months ago, I thought it was a very good film. Last night I saw it again, just to remember it well, and now I can say for sure it is my favorite film of all time. It is a gorgeous picture, great directing and spectacular acting. Kevin Spacey in particular has a more than well-deserved Oscar for this marvelous performance. It's very sad that many people rate this film badly only because of their beliefs and morals--you don't rate a movie on that grounds, that's ridiculous. A movie is judged on its performance and how it handled every aspect of it, aside from your personal philosophy or religion. A work of art is judged qua art, not qua ethical or political considerations.<br/><br/>This movie is extremely beautiful and I hope many more people experience the joy of watching it unfold."

","American Beauty is a 1999 American drama film directed by Sam Mendes and written by Alan Ball. Kevin Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, an office worker who has a midlife crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter's best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). Annette Bening co-stars as Lester's materialistic wife, Carolyn, and Thora Birch plays their insecure daughter, Jane. Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, and Allison Janney also feature. The film has been described by academics as a satire of American middle class notions of beauty and personal satisfaction; analysis has focused on the film's explorations of romantic and paternal love, sexuality, beauty, materialism, self- liberation, and redemption."

","Lester Burnham (Spacey) is 42 years old living in archetypal suburban America. He has a typical office job that he hates, an obsessive, controlling wife (Annette Bening) and a robotic teenage daughter (Thora Birch) who sees absolutely nothing positive in him as a father. <br/><br/>Then Lester meets daughter Jane's friend Angela (Mena Suvari) at a cheerleading event and is smitten, resulting in all those rose petal-themed fantasies that have become incredibly iconic. Then, Lester chooses to escape his slave-like life. He quits his job, trades his car for his dream automobile (a Pontiac Firebird) and starts working out to impress the blonde-haired girl he is becoming weirdly attracted to (not that Angela minds that much). Of course, things get quite tricky for others around him and this builds to a slow, but powerful and tragic ending.<br/><br/>The film does not just follow the Lester-Angela relationship. Burnham gets on well with adolescent Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley), an eccentric, troubled new neighbour, who in turn gets into a relationship with Jane. First she dislikes him, but gets closer and soon she shows interest in his bizarre hobby, Ricky filming just about anything with his camcorder that catches his attention. The plastic bag floating in the wind was apparently the inspiration for scriptwriter Alan Ball. Meanwhile Mrs. Burnham, lacking excitement in her life as well, starts an affair with a rival house seller. And Ricky's father, Col. Fits (Chris Cooper) is a violent man, who goes too far upon believing that his son is gay. In a nutshell, there are a lot of dynamic, unusual characters.<br/><br/>For Cambridge-educated, British director Sam Mendes, this was his first feature length movie. His work, using cool camera techniques including the extensive use of camcorders won him an Oscar and Mendes would go on to direct movies such as Skyfall.<br/><br/>His film defiantly states that being free from the boundaries of life is important and as shown on Fits' camera, there is so much beauty to see if you look closer, as is the film's tagline. It doesn't just exist in Jane and Angela, who are both rather spectacular to look at. American Beauty deserved the Oscar for Best Film as did Kevin Spacey for Best Leading Actor. Along with the other two groundbreaking movies of '99, the Matrix and Fight Club (now I have seen all three!), it gives a quality message to us people: break free."

","Lester Burnham has been complacent with his boring, mediocre life for a long time... and now he's seeing red. In Sam Mendes' American Beauty (Cohen, 1999), Lester (Kevin Spacey) is burnt out from getting walked over all the time and he revolts. He begins blackmailing his boss, confronting his wife, Carolyn (Annette Benning), and he starts a new life with the intention of doing whatever he pleases. This includes pursuing his fantasy girl, the seemingly floozy Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), friend of his high school daughter, Jane. Lester is happy for the first time in years.<br/><br/>American Beauty is an invigorating adventure of growing self-awareness, while boldly walking the line between new-found self-esteem and questionable moral decisions, perhaps later influencing movies like The Squid and the Whale (Baumbach, 2005). Throughout the film, everybody seems to be hiding something. Everybody has a facade they present to others and then there are the dark secrets, kept hidden so everything seems normal on the outside (Cohen, 1999). The film is destined to strike a nerve with American culture. Some elements are especially taboo, but betrayal, delusion, and coming of age are all very real and relevant topics for many of us.<br/><br/>While the film topics may make some viewers wince, the cinematography makes it difficult for one to look away. Mendes is a master at dramatizing Lester's fantasies, like the first time Lester lays his eyes on Angela at the half-time dance show. As the shots cut back and forth between Lester and Angela, they gradually become the only two people in the dark gymnasium, a spotlight on Angela, dancing more and more seductively, and Lester alone in the bleachers, his face filled with desire (Cohen, 1999).<br/><br/>This desire and lust is carried through the movie by use of the color red. Red flower petals adorn Angela in Les' fantasies, red flower frame her shots, and when Carolyn drives by the bench advertisement with her lover's face plastered, it too is in full red. This use of extremely dramatic color makes for some really interesting shots, as well as simple creation of some symbolic depth (Cohen, 1999).<br/><br/>American Beauty tells a relevant and credible story and Kevin Spacey can do it like nobody else (Cohen, 1999). This film exemplifies the highest quality in every aspect of the film-making process. It is worth your time, your money, and it may even make you reconsider your life choices. <br/><br/>References Cohen, Bruce (Producer) & Sam Mendes. (1999). American Beauty {Motion picture}.

","Watched this again recently. Now I'm nearer Lester's age, I look at the film from a different angle (you could say) and it's still marvelous.<br/><br/>Plenty of comedy here, but there are also lots of subtle points about ""normality"", meaningless jobs, beauty. <br/><br/>Each one of these ideas could take up a film in themselves. We could spend all day in the forums discussing different sorts of normality - how people tend to all think their family is uniquely crazy, how Angela is terrified of being normal, how Ricki is comfortable with not being normal, how the Burnhams *pretend* to normality. But one film can only say so much in a few brush strokes, and AB does it wonderfully.<br/><br/>The film has a strange take on beauty, which Ricky sees in many unlikely places, including in death - as he tries to explain. I occasionally think that - though, as we get older, we're incredibly bored with this world and hardly see things properly at all - if you look at things in the right way, or for the first time, every moment is quite incredibly breathtaking. I expressed that poorly, but it's a powerful message for me.<br/><br/>You're left wondering about these people. How did they get that way? What happened next? A sequel or prequel would perhaps spoil it.<br/><br/>Finally, the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard - very important to me from a film.<br/><br/>I wish I could erase all memory of this film, and watch it anew in a big, hushed cinema with excellent sound, sitting next to someone I loved."

It's a film without mercy, so tragic that becomes comical.

","...about American Beauty, that hasn't already been said? This is hands-down one of the best films ever made. EVER. For starters, the tone & dialog are very sharp and stunning: it goes from being sardonic with acerbic wit and dialog, to just plain funny. It's an indictment on a certain segment of American culture, at least as seen through the eyes of Alan Ball, and it's immensely entertaining in the process.<br/><br/>This film broke new ground in cinema, which is not an easy thing to achieve. The characters are each superbly written and well-studied: there's not one character that doesn't belong or serve a purpose in the story. Then, it hits on so many different levels. What's more is, as the audience, we get to see each character in their own private world, so we can feel sympathy for each one of them, that they are each going through their own struggles in their life, even if we don't agree with or loathe them otherwise. <br/><br/>Then there's the ending...and WHOA, what an ending: Alan Ball manages something incredible and triumphant, something that is rarely achieved, in that he all of a sudden presents an entirely new, if dark scenario (when Lester is killed), asks a question (who shot him?), and answers it all in the span of about two minutes, all on the heels of of very entertaining and grippingly dramatic journey through the characters' lives that is at once funny, serious, devastating and poignant, and leaves you thinking ""what the heck did I just see?"". I've never seen any other film that accomplishes this. It's simply a stunning piece of work from every angle, one that reveals more and more layers with each repeated viewing. This movie broke the mold for what a film can be. A masterpiece among masterpieces."
"jedmonds-691-762586","10","1","2","14 September 2013"," Philosophical and Thought Provoking
","American Beauty (1999) is a film about Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), a suburban father slipping deeper and deeper into depression, struggling to deal with his bitch-on-wheels wife and a daughter that hates him. When he meets his daughter's attractive friend, that sparks a mid life crisis, and he decides to turn his life around. The plot sounds trite when you describe it; A man going through a mid life crisis dealing with family issues, lusting after his daughters sex kitten teenage friend. The characters are all cliché; the midlife crisis dad, his bitch-on-wheels wife, his sassy teenage daughter that hates her parents, the homophobic military man next door, and the promiscuous high school girl. We've all seen those characters in movies before. What amazes me about this film is how they brought all these characters together and produced a philosophical movie that makes you think about society. ""My wife and daughter think I'm this chronic loser."" Lester complains, and they see him like that for good reason. ""Just look at me, jerking off in the shower, that's the high point of my day, it only goes downhill from here"" Lester comments as we see a visual of a body blurred by the glass door of a shower, facing away from camera as his arm moves up and down. When you see his infatuation with his daughters friend, Angela (Mena Suvari) you find it amusing and somewhat comical. You see how he acts during his midlife crises, what he says and his actions are also very amusing, and you wish you could get away with doing stuff like that. Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening) is a real estate saleswoman who is obsessed with the idea of success. ""That's my wife, Carolyn. You see the way her pruning shears match her gardening clogs? That's not a coincidence"" Lester remarks introducing her in the beginning of the movie. Carolyn has an obsession of her own, her public image. Jane Burnham (Thora Birch) is the stereotypical teenage girl, sassy, parent-hating, and insecure. She's the opposite of her friend Angela. She's solemn, non-promiscuous, and she's not attractive in the way our society defines it. ""I need a father who's a role model, not some nerdy geek boy who's going to spray his pants every time I have a girlfriend over."" She remarks to her boyfriend Ricky. She's embarrassed by his dad, and the way he lusts after Angela. Most people that review this movie see her as a bad person, but as a fellow teenager, I can empathize with her. To me, the most thought provoking and intriguing character is Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley), the strange boy next door who video tapes all of his life experiences and sells drugs. Ricky seems to find beauty in everything he sees, and seems strange from the outside. When you look into his family though, and you see his abusive, homophobic, marine father and his defeated mother, you realize what's going on behind closed doors. This movie has so many different lessons about society. First of all, the tagline, ""Look Closer"" is a lesson in itself. If you just look at everybody without paying attention to detail, you won't notice anything wrong, but if you look closer, you realize that everybody is in some way or another, trying to fit in. It also taught me that if you look close enough, you can find beauty in everything. For example, the plastic bag scene where Ricky films a plastic bag floating in the wind for fifteen minutes. While people may say ""It's just a plastic bag, what so beautiful about that."" To which I would say that beauty is subjective; what one person finds beautiful might be repulsive to another person. This movie also beautifully illustrates the disillusionment phenomenon we all have experienced, which is when you realize something is not as good as it once seemed. It also taught me to not judge a book by its cover. From the outside, the Burnham's look like the perfect family, but behind that bright red door, it's a totally different story. This is one of those movies that if you get it, you'll love it but if you don't, you'll hate it. If you come in to it watching with an open mind, all you need to do is sit back and watch, and be amazed by its beauty. If you want a philosophical drama movie that will make you think about the society we live in, then this is the movie for you. If you're going to watch a movie, I encourage you to watch it with an open mind. This movie taught me many valuable lessons about society, all while being entertaining and funny at times. 10/10"
"R-P-McMurphy","10","1","2","13 August 2013"," Self-Liberating
","""American Beauty"" is one of my favorite films, for me watching it feels kind of like a pat in the back, like I've found someone who thinks just like me, one of the best feelings there is next to being distracted.<br/><br/>Its the story of Lester Burnham, a man who's going to die a year from when we first meet him. He wants to set himself free from everything that's making him feel depressed while also feeling attracted to his daughter's best friend.<br/><br/>It's one of the ""self-liberating"" films that came out in 1999, along with ""Fight Club"" and Office Space. A sub-genre I think first started with François Truffaut's ""The 400 Blows"", a film that isn't afraid to speak to its audience and really touch people. ""American Beauty"" is a film that turns to you and asks ""How do you feel?"".<br/><br/>Talking about this movie could go on forever, its obvious that movies like ""Lolita"" inspired it apart from others I'm not really sure of like ""Kes"", ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Blue Velvet"", ""Citizen Kane"", and ""The Godfather: Part II"".<br/><br/>I hate to mention every single technical aspect of a movie in a review, but this film sort of deserves having everyone who worked on it mentioned. The performances in this are all amazing, no character is left underdeveloped and we leave the film thinking that we actually know these characters, something very hard to find in films (e.g. Dazed and Confused).<br/><br/>I can find identify myself very much with the characters, specially Lester (Kevin Spacey) and Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley), and even the others I can understand up to some level. Like Lester's wife, a person who's lost herself to materialism while striving for perfection. Or Lester's daughter, someone who feels lonely and ignored by her parents.<br/><br/>The simplicity in the cinematography fits the story perfectly, unlike films like ""Magnolia"" that give a human story the wrong cinematographic approach and make it feel more like a thriller or comedies like ""The Big Lebowski"" that turn away from the comedy and give the film more style over substance. The score and the soundtrack also add a lot to the film, letting us know the state of mind of the characters or enhancing a feeling to the audience.<br/><br/>Finally, it's hard not to love the beautiful and poetic script by Alan Ball (my favorite writer after Charlie Kaufman), dealing with themes of death, materialism, and redemption. It's a film that shows the beauty in cinema as an art form, in the way that what the film says couldn't be said as well in any other medium. For example, had it been made as a play, we wouldn't understand the characters as well for the intimacy that cinema gives us would be lost.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it to anyone who liked ""The Ice Storm"", ""The Virgin Suicides"", ""Little Children"", ""Lost in America"", ""The Kids are All Right"", ""Donnie Darko"", ""Lost in Translation"", Wes Anderson movies, or any film I mentioned before."
"chrisenhall","Null","1","2","17 May 2013"," Critical Response of the techniques used in American Beauty
","Cinema often uses structured set design and camera angles to convey meaning to an audience. Throughout American Beauty, Mendes' use of set design and camera angles have been carefully structured to empathize the film's theme of imprisonment. In the opening scene the audience's introduction to the lead character is Lester Burnham taking a shower. Mendes (1999) states this is the first jail cell the audience sees Lester in, a range of various jail cell type settings appear throughout the film including Lester presented excessively behind glass, between frames and at work, where he is confined to a small cubicle in a very large office (Appalachian, 2009). The effect of Lester imprisoned suggests he is isolated and removed from the world around him. The camera angles used exaggerate this and highlight Lester's deflation of power against the significant people in his life. This technique is shown to define the relationship between Lester and his boss, Brad. During a private conversation about budget cuts at work, Brad's superiority is enforced as he shot from a low angle, whereas Lester is shot from a high angle, this creates the effect that Lester is far away from Brad, which demonstrates to the audience the vast power Brad has over him. Mendes (1999) describes Lester as ""distant and isolated"" in this scene. This technique is also replicated throughout the movie to empathize Lester's detached relationship from his wife, Carolyn and daughter, Jane. The scene where Lester is seen to delay his wife by spilling his briefcase on the pavement before entering the car, Carolyn, similarly to Brad is shot from a low angle again which enforces Lester's lack of power and her superiority. Interestingly, as the film progresses and Lester's relationships evolve, the camera angles also evolve in reverse and the audience begins to see Lester shot in a low angle and characters like Carolyn are shot in a high angle, indicating that Carolyn is now vulnerable. These altered camera angles give Lester a triumphant image.<br/><br/>Another technique Mendes uses is color. The use of color is often an important technique utilized by film directors to communicate themes and ideas to an audience. In American Beauty, Mendes powerfully uses color to communicate that the characters are attempting to escape from their imprisonment. Initially the characters are seen in environments that are very dull and nondescript, as Mendes (1999) states when referring to Lester's work setting. As Lester's quest for escapement gains momentum, the vivid color of red is gradually introduced more into this film through subtle furnishings in the Burnham house and particularly integrated with Lester's sexual fantasies. The use of the vibrant, red rose petal is first introduced when Lester and Carolyn attend Jane's cheer <br/><br/>performance, where Lester loses himself as he enters his first ""tunnel of fantasy"" (Mendes, 1999). Deschler (1999) states the rose is symbolic of American beauty, and the color red symbolizes passion and love. The significance of the rose petal and the color red is repeatedly seen throughout the film in house furnishings such as a bouquet of roses on the coffee table and vividly in Lester's fantasies about Jane's friend, Angela, the increasing level of red in the film is in conjunction with Lester's progressing sexual drive and transformation. The flourishing presence of the color red, acknowledges Lester's fierce lust and desire to be free. This is effectively conveyed during the scene where Lester visualizes Angela in a vibrant sea of roses, touching herself seductively on his bedroom ceiling, also when Lester buys the car ""he has always wanted"" (Ball, 1999), which is a 1970 Firebird and strategically, red.<br/><br/>Music is a powerful medium in film and Mendes uses the soundtrack in American Beauty to articulate the character's evolving personalities and relationships, and to set the tone of each scene, particularly noticeable during Lester's transformation. Composer, Thomas Newman's score is described as ""lonely and melancholy"" (Mendes, 1999), which is an appropriate expression for Lester's existence at the beginning of this film. This is similarly demonstrated and supports to define the initial relationship between Lester and Carolyn, as shown by the dull music that Carolyn chooses to play at the dinner table. When Lester's journey to freedom gains speed, evidently his sense of self worth has increased as there is an optimistic lift in the genre of music that is played as the backdrop to Lester's life. This melancholy music played at the beginning of the film, begins to disappear and is replaced by fast paced, rock music. Simultaneously as Lester's lifestyle transforms into marijuana smoking and employment at a fast food restaurant, so does too his interest in listening to seventies rock music (Deschler, 1999). At the height of Lester's transformation, an important scene where the soundtrack effectively communicates a liberating change in personality is when he is recklessly driving his 1970 Firebird, whilst singing along to Guess Who's rock hit ""American Woman,"" he confidently sings the lyrics ""American woman, stay away from me"" (Ball, 2009). This rebellious choice of song supports Lester's new found freedom from his corporate life and could even suggest that Lester is newly unaffected by his wife's judgments and bounds by recreating his lost youth. In many of the fantasy sequences involving Angela, the music composed is seductive and trance like, which mirror's the effect Angela has on Lester (Huffstutler, 2009), the technique of soundtrack is effectively used here to set a strong tone for the audience. <br/><br/>In American Beauty, director, Sam Mendes uses the Burnham family to demonstrate the breakdown of a suburban family and possibly to encourage his audience to 'look closer' and past what often appears, to be a seamless, picture perfect life. American Beauty effectively employs the techniques of set design, camera angles, color and soundtrack to convey the meaning of this film, which is to escape from imprisonment."

","Kevin Spacey will always be the teacher in ""Pay It Forward"" for me, but that doesn't make him any less of a versatile actor. The entire cast was great, including Chris Cooper as a closeted homosexual and the young Wes Bentley as an abnormal deceiver. While the infamous ""plastic bag"" scene both awful and stupid, pretty much everything else was fantastic. From the Smiley's discovery to the disturbing videos Ricky shot, pretty much all of the movie is important, interesting and quite thought-provoking. And what I think to be the best part: the lack of a resolution. Since the movie is from Lester's POV, it makes sense that he wouldn't know how it ended. I liked this movie, as weird as it was, and would probably recommend it."
"manendra-lodhi","8","1","2","21 October 2012"," ""A little too overrated.""
","The film is the showcase of American people lifestyle. However I do believe that films do present things with a little exaggeration and that they are mostly not true (Unless of course based on true incident.). But considering that 40% of all is true I pitied while watching the movie, because of the sad lives of the American families. The story of the film is good and is told from the perspective of a Man named Lester. He is having trouble holding everything together and especially when his family doesn't show much respect to him. There are interesting things too when he gets attracted to one of a friend of his daughter and even fantasizes to have sex with her. While the film does not offer anything great in the story but there is a little feel of reality in that which might make you curious. I have always loved family dramas because they are the best source of information about the middle class people of that country. To be really true I felt like laughing after watching the film. Having watched a lot of dramas in various languages we have the portrayal of American family which is so sad.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>The film has emotional dramas mixed with a little humor at appropriate places. There are misunderstandings also. There is a hidden message present in the film. I feel happy to say that the director was able to portray a very important thing – ""Happiness"". When you will focus on the characters, you will found out that no one was happy in reality. All of them were hiding behind a sense of misjudgment. Sometimes even this is conveyed through dialogs when the characters say to each other's that you are just a sad old man. The movie wanted to convey that you have to really find happiness somewhere; otherwise ultimately you will get frustrated. Then this frustration ultimately leads to a lot of further problems.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>While everything including the story and the acting of the cast was perfect, I felt like some kind of energy was lacking in the film. It will give you instances to laugh or feel bad but all comes too slowly and have a dull demeanor. <br/><br/>MESSAGE: ""Find Happiness.""<br/><br/>VERDICT: ""A recommended watch."""

","American BEAUTY (1999) Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper Rated R. 5 Academy awards. Tagline: ""...look closer.""<br/><br/>If this film bothers you, you're not alone. It does push buttons. The suburban middle class dream sometimes is not exactly what it appears to be on the picture perfect surface, and it gets taken to the wood shed here. The white picket fence can only hide so much from view before the dark secrets are finally uncovered. The Thomas Newman musical score is evocative with a hovering sense of sweet melancholy, yet it has a thoroughly haunting, icy-edged poignancy that cannot be resisted; it reflectively explores the hollow rewards of the death trap known as the rat race with all of its inherent disillusionment. More than a musical underscore, this is a sublimely eloquent work of art by Newman, perhaps his signature best, so very beautiful that when I hear it, it overflows and I don't know how I can possibly hold it all inside. This is a film that is funny, sad, disturbing and strangely beautiful. This movie is new every time I watch it. I never seem to remember everything that it contains, yet at times it's somehow impossible to forget a single moment. For cinema lovers especially, this motion picture is a masterfully crafted experience. Warning: This movie is not for those who are looking for simple escapist entertainment or for those who tend to hide their head in the sand. It's far from simple and it's uncompromisingly blunt. This is as sly as a film can possibly be, where your soul is given the opportunity to connect all the dots, and you're left to discover the true nature of beauty that's always there in front of us.

","'American Beauty' is not just a film to view or a story to adore, it is something more like a vast experience, a journey to witness and when do you realize these things? it is when you meet the protagonist, this very ordinary and common man called Lester Burnham, played beautifully by Kevin Spacey, but it is not Spacey, whom we witness on screen, it is Lester the man. Let's just forget everything else and simply stare at Lester's life as he narrates to us. The fact is it is not just Spacey who breathes life into the film, almost every character shines in their respective roles, giving a perfect team work. What the film demands for is, how you, the viewer studies the various characters. What supports Spacey's brilliant performance are an excellent support from Annette Benning, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley and Mena Suvari. Apart from them the rest other cast give a worthy support. You can't help but gaze at the entire cast performance and get involved with them each mentally because you are forced to see situations from their individual perspectives. Nothing more to say, watch out this film yourself and you will realize that a life can be much more than you ever thought. Trust me, you will think it over and over again, its not just a film but a mild experience. Without a doubt, its a 9.9 out of 10."
"ValeEspinzoa","9","1","2","13 December 2011"," American Beauty Review.
","Like most films, 'American Beauty' begins with a quote, ""In a way, It's like I'm dead already"" that will help the audience to have a better grasp of the films' conclusion. I love this movie, not only for the great directing and screenplay but the Academy Award winning performance of Kevin Spacey. I had read 'American Beauty' before I watched it, and the way that Spacey acted Lester out was superb. Often you don't get actors who can physically and mentally get into character, usually one is enough. I was also impressed with Annette Bening's performance. She is the complete opposite of her real life self in the film and it really proves the length an actress would go to achieve a the directors true perspective of the character. The story didn't bore me whatsoever, the color could have been much brighter and possibly more uplifting but it doesn't collide with the story. The story is a 'dull life' of a man and when he isn't upset and/or fed up you can see change in brighter color. Like in the memorably famous rose petal scene with the beautiful Mena Suvari, this is Lester's fantasy, it's liberal for him to fantasize and with his life that tends to take forever to end Lester becomes self involved in his fantasy. This movie is totally unique, It's Real, bold and honest. In shorter words, American Beauty is a fantastic movie that I would recommend to any people (Over the age of 15) to watch and maybe take a moment to think about life itself."
"unklechunkle","10","1","2","8 December 2011"," A brilliant debut from director Sam Mendes
","Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a middle-aged magazine writer suffering from a mid-life crisis, he is discontent with his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening), his job and his life in general. His life changes when he becomes infatuated with his daughter's friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari). He changes his life for the better, embracing the music of his youth and working out in his garage, smoking pot. He blackmails his now former employers, gets a low-responsibility job at a fast food joint and buys his dream car. A life free from responsibility and worries comes at cost though, and Lester ultimately pays the ultimate price.<br/><br/>That is just one interpretation of this film, but to be honest, American Beauty is a film about so much more than sexual desire. It is a social commentary on the 'American Dream', the perfect lives that suburban families supposedly live, and the physical and psychologically effects on those who strive for it. The character of Carolyn best represents this, as a Realtor who is so ambitious to be the best, that she often breaks down and builds herself up again with motivational books and tapes, and also seeking comfort from successful Realtor Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher).<br/><br/>American Beauty, as the name suggests, is also concerned with love and different perceptions of beauty. Jane (Thora Birch), the Burnhams' daughter, strives for breast augmentation and is constantly embarrassed by her parents, almost leaving her a social outcast. Conversely, her friend Angela is a confident and attractive blonde who brags of her sexual experiences while dreaming of becoming a model, she loves the possibility that Lester is attracted to her. In these two characters you have stereotypical characters it could be said but what changes this is Wes Bentley's character Ricky Fits. Fits' and his parents, a bigoted US marine (Chris Cooper) and his introverted wife (Alison Janney), move next door to Burnhams and Ricky quickly starts to observe them with his video camera, especially Jane. The two later begin a relationship, to Alison's dismay, and Ricky confides in Jane is acute sense of beauty he finds in the simple things, such as a paper bag blowing in the wind. The film definitely supports the 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder' view, Lester desires Angela's superficial beauty but Ricky finds inner beauty, in Jane and in the world around him.<br/><br/>The film also raises the conflict between the material world and the more spiritual world. Lester is the only character able to escape from the dull, materialistic society he sees around him by doing what he wants to do like buying his dream car and working out in a bid to impress Angela. Carolyn, on the other hand, has become disillusioned by the world as her ambitions to become better and better eat away at her. By the end of the film, however, it is Lester who is 'punished'. After a moment of clarity in which he comes to realise the importance of his family, he is killed by Ricky's father. However, Lester has actually been redeemed because he watches his life flash before him, and he sees all the beauty in his life, which does not include Angela."

","I believe that everyone should see this movie. Aside from the fact that the acting borders on phenomenal and the fact that the cinematography and script were masterpieces in themselves, the THEME of this movie should be witnessed by all.<br/><br/>I have read many reviews that talk about how this movie is trying to express how complete devotion to our jobs and material goods leaves us empty and worthless as human beings. I have also read reviews that claim this movie tells us what happened to our good old American family values. And while these claims are completely accurate, they are still only part of the deeper message presented in this film. I know that the title is ""American Beauty,"" but I believe that it is only being used as a symbol, like everything else in the movie. Yes, America is know worldwide for its excesses in all forms, so it is a good example of a trend that plagues humanity as a whole.<br/><br/>See, the emphasis of this movie is on beauty. Not beauty as we normally think of it, but beauty as all that should be admired and respected and loved in the world. ""American beauty"" represents what we are TAUGHT to perceive as beautiful. A nice car, a supermodel, and so on. The message I got from this movie is that nature is beautiful, and by nature I mean everything in this world in its natural state. Humans are beautiful when they are honest, but not when they try to fit the molds our societies make for us. This is so well expressed in one scene in the movie when Ricky is asked why he is filming a dead bird and he replies, ""Because it's beautiful.""<br/><br/>Ricky later shows us the most beautiful thing he ever filmed: a plastic bag being blown by the wind. The symbolism here is magnificent! The plastic bag, as a representative of man made culture, being completely controlled and driven by pure nature. This movie doesn't condemn our society and point fingers at the causes of our unhappiness. Instead it gives us hope and direction toward a better path that we left a long long time ago. Don't let anyone tell you that this isn't a happy movie, for it is full of hope. And more importantly, it is full of beauty. See this movie, and more importantly, THINK about this movie."

","I saw this film many years ago and I remember it being rather great. As it came to the top of my list again I decided to give it another go and I'm very glad I did! It's better than great, it's truly excellent! I can't say I've enjoyed a film more in a very long time! Some extraordinary characters, brilliant performances and an excellent script combine to make up one of the best films to come out of Hollywood in the 1990's by far! But enough of my praise, here's a brief summary before I praise it some more.<br/><br/>Lester Burnham has a boring job and lives with his wife, Carolyn, and daughter, Jane, in sweet suburbia. Family life is far from happy for any of them; Carolyn is cold to Lester and he finds that hard to take. Jane doesn't find it easy to fit in and thinks her parents are freaks. She has one friend, Angela Hayes, who becomes an object of affection for Lester, much to Jane's disapproval. Things take a turn when teenager, Ricky Fits moves in next door with his repressive father, Col. Frank Fits, USMC and mother, Barbara. Ricky likes to film everything with his video camera and he eventually introduces himself to the Burnham's. He and his father are about to have a big impact on their lives, much bigger than any of them could have imagined. I'll leave it there or the Spoiler Police will be sending me away to an asylum (again).<br/><br/>Alongside a, now iconic, musical score by Thomas Newman, there is also a great collection of contemporary songs used in the film. Beautifully made with not one wasted scene, a rare thing these days. As far as performances go, well, nobody put a foot wrong. Kevin Spacey was brilliant as Lester Burnham and Annette Bening played his wife Carolyn to a tee! Thora Birch as Jane Burnham, Wes Bentley as Ricky Fits and Mena Suvari as Angela Hayes were all excellent! I must also give honourable mentions to; Chris Cooper as Col. Frank Fits, USMC, Peter Gallagher as Buddy Kane, Allison Janney as Barbara Fits (I had forgotten she was in it), Scott Bakula as Jim Olmeyer, Sam Robards as Jim Berkley and Barry Del Sherman as Bard Dupree.<br/><br/>I think I liked this movie even more this time around. Since I started documenting the films I've watched, I've come to appreciate the filmmakers' art more and more. And I think it is because of this I have a greater appreciation when I see something that I can admire not only for how it makes me feel, but also for the skill of the people that put it out there. It's a film I would recommend to anyone that loves film, it is one of the best films I've seen this year and will easily make my top ten Highly recommended.<br/><br/>My Score: 9.3/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 8.6/10 (based on 358,207 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes Score: 88/100 (based on 152 reviews counted at the time of going to press)."

","Re-watching American Beauty 11 years later, I must admit, I was somewhat underwhelmed. The impact it had on first viewing didn't quite last. The film was praised for its deconstruction of the American dream and portrayal of the dark undertones of suburban life, but the fact is that was done more powerfully in Todd Solondz's movies, and American Beauty just doesn't seem very shocking - maybe it was more so in the 90's, I'm not sure. As a drama, though, it's still very powerful, and the characters are compelling, lovable and despicable at once, and it does a very good job of making the viewers care about them - in complete contrast with Happiness, with deliberately keeps a wall of coldness and distance. The wonderful acting helps, especially from Thora Birch, who at that point had the potential to become one of the greatest actresses of the new millennium.<br/><br/>At the time of its release American Beauty was hailed as a masterpiece - it doesn't quite seem like one now. Rather, it's a good drama with some fantastic directorial work and some truly great moments, and a very humble movie at that. The fact that I don't consider it one of the top films of the 90's doesn't change the fact that its Best Picture Oscar was one of the best and gutsiest choices the Academy made that decade."

","American Beauty-****-A Masterpiece- Directed by: Sam Mendes, Written by: Alan Ball Starring: Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper, Allison Janney, Peter Gallagher, Mena Suvari, Wes Bentley.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes' first feature presents an affectionate and satirical look at American life in the suburbs centering around a dysfunctional family trying to find the meaning of life amongst all the chaos of their lives. Spacey is trying to relive his teenage years which leads him into domestic, professional, sexual, and financial difficulty. Bening is his uptight wife and looks for sex from other extramarital sources. Birch is their teenage daughter who is attracted with a kid next door obsessed with his video camera and whose family troubles involve psychological disorder and sexual repression.<br/><br/>Mendes develops characters for his satire, not caricatures and keeps the perception of society reasonable and believable. The characters are certainly not role models, but they are likable. Spacey, our protagonist, is sexually attached to a teenage girl, quits his job, and smokes pot. What's heroic or likable about those qualities? That is where Mendes (along with Ball)'s genius comes into play. The members of society we normally look down upon are the film's heroes, mostly it is because they are the normal characters of today's society.<br/><br/>That is the piercing honesty that makes this film so acidic in its delivery. Cooper's character, a homophobic marine, a man society would most likely look up to is the film's antagonist. This reflects cultural shifts and the irony of the proposed American lifestyle over the true perception we have over our lives. That is the poison this film holds to our heads and refuses to let go until it forces an honest reaction over all the programmed reactions we force ourselves to have for the sake of being well-liked and appreciated in our communities.<br/><br/>The romance between Birch and Bentley is the only relationship in the film that is driven out of love and not sex or status. Bentley's character is the most ironic point Mendes makes within the film because he appears the weirdest and most perverted but he turns out the most honest and beautiful. This further emphasizes Mendes' point that life is different from the outside looking in rather than the inside looking out.<br/><br/>Mendes changes the way we look at each other and the way we look at ourselves. He questions appearances and frames of mind, much like Todd Solondz's Happiness. Though that film's mastery is evident, this is the most connectible American drama/satire released in years."

","Brief Plot Summary: American Beauty is a film about a man in his mid-forties going through a mid – life crisis in which he resigns from his job as advertising agent to re-live his youth and impress a high school cheerleader who is friends with his child. Lester Burnham also begins smoking drugs, in which he buys his drugs from a neighbor named Ricky and begins a new job at a local restaurant. His wife, Carolyn begins cheating on him with a rival business salesperson. This affair doesn't bother Lester at all. Themes: In this film, there are a plethora of themes. A few of those themes are rejection, greediness, realism, and isolation. Through scheme, classification, and camera work these ideas are expressed soundly. Throughout the movie each individual is a representative in of a few of subjects listed. The first is greediness, Carolyn know this well. She denies Lester an intimate moment because she is more worried about ruining her material items and she wants more and better things (Mendes, 1999). In the theme of realism, the only person that was actually who they said they were Jane. Jane didn't put on to be anybody but herself. Ricky wanted his father to see him in one light and then in the mean time be a different person when at school or in his community by being a drug dealer. The colonel is the main culprit; he wants to appear to be against gays but in reality is secretly gay himself. Actors with Character Names Kevin Spacey aka Lester Burnham Thiora Birchaka Jane Burnham Scott Bakulaaka Jim Olmeyer <br/><br/>Reference to one other film similar to this film: this movie is similar to the Virgin Suicides because like American Beauty and Lester developing an infatuation with Angela. The Virgin Suicides a clique of boys develop a liking to a group of girls (siblings). <br/><br/>Two techniques: In the film, sounds and camera angles are a major importance to the film. In the film there was a wide utilization of motionless pictures and sluggish pans and up close and far out views to spawn turbulence. American Beauty pursues a storyline type film, just briefly moving into the disarranged beginning of Ricky the drug dealer and Jane the daughter or Lester and Carolyn videotaping each other carrying on a conversation (Mendes, 1999). Also, in this film, sound was used to show Lester's imagination and gives a voice of the mind frame of the character. The soundtrack ---the pop music ---is used to show Lester's attempt to re-do his youth.<br/><br/>Tie in comment on theme: The theme in this film is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. That is how Lester views it. Lester saw that money didn't make him happy and wanted to re-do his teenage years when he was the happiest. The film also tied in because beauty isn't always about what looks beautiful, for example Angela, who was beautiful but did not have the character and Jane who did not have the outward beauty, but had a heart of gold."

","American Beauty is a 1999 drama film directed by Sam Mendes and written by Alan Ball. The film stars Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham and Annette Bening co-starring as Carolyn Burnham. The film also features Thora Birch as Jane, the daughter of Lester and Carolyn, Mena Suvari as Angela, Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper and Allison Janney are also featured in the film.<br/><br/>The film centers around Lester Burnham and his relationship with his wife, who is an over-achieving realtor who has drifted away from her husband, a non-existing relationship with his daughter, Jane, who he thinks hates him, and finally with Angela, his daughter's friend in which he is infatuated with. The film also delves into the relationship of the Burnham's new neighbors, Colonel Fits and his wife and son Ricky.<br/><br/>The theme of the film is that people are not always what they appear to be. For example Angela was a beautiful girl, Lester sees her as this sex symbol, yet in the end finds out that she is indeed a virgin. Colonel Fits runs a tight ship at home and wants everyone to conform to the way he sees things. He beats his son Ricky after he falsely admits to being gay. In the end it is revealed that in fact Colonel Fits is gay.<br/><br/>The film uses red rose petals as motifs several times throughout the film whenever Lester is thinking of Angela. The use of narration by Lester gives the audience an insight into what he was thinking and feeling. At the lowest point in Lester's life, his thoughts of Angela drove him to do things like buying and smoking marijuana, in efforts to relive portions of his childhood.<br/><br/>Another theme in the film would be that youth and beauty equates happiness. When Lester did things like lust after a teenage girl and smoke marijuana, he seemed happy. Ricky sees beauty in everyday life, videoing as much as he can for fear of missing it. He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed: a plastic bag, tossing in the wind in front of a wall. He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was ""an entire life behind things""; he feels that ""sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it ... and my heart is going to cave in."""

","What to say about ""American Beauty""? Hmmm. I have never seen a movie that cogently blends together elements of a pragmatic social satire and a poignant domestic tragedy. Though, this is by far one of the most messed up films I have ever seen. . .it is also one of the best. Kevin Spacey gives one of his most memorable performances with his Academy Award Winning Turn as Lester Burnham - a character that is definitely flawed, but you just can't help but like him. Another aspect of the film I admired was the soundtrack. Thomas Newman really succeeds in creating a provocative, yet beautiful score that adequately complements the movie's overall tone. In the end, I feel that ""American Beauty"" is a movie that most people can and will enjoy."

","Ever wonder what the mysterious neighbors down the street are up to? Do you ever wonder what kind of dark secrets and twisted tales might be lying just down the road from you? Wouldn't you like to know all of the harsh realities of your seemingly utopian suburb? Or would you? Would it really be worth it to know just how dark the simple suburban neighborhood can be? Could you really handle what kind of unexpectedly horrendous things could be unfolding so close to home in such a picturesque neighborhood like yours? Watch American Beauty and you'll find out.<br/><br/>1999's best picture winner tells the story of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), a depressed suburban husband/father who after so much ridicule and neglect from his wife and daughter decides he has had enough and attempts to improve his life. What really kick starts this change is his perverted obsession with his daughter's friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). And so while Lester tries to impress Angela, the rest of his family and neighbors try to cope with their own mundane existences. Lester's wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), is a real estate agent trying to better herself in every way possible, trying so hard not to be a victim of herself. Lester's daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), is trying to survive living with her neurotic and psychotic parents, finding shelter in her next door neighbor Ricky, a nineteen year old boy who spends his days filming the subtle and rare beauties in life, while also dealing with an abusive father. This is a film that so masterfully blends together the twisted fates of a collection of fabulously interesting characters, all in an ironically simple suburban setting. It chronicles the dark side of the American dream and seeks to discover what true American beauty really is.<br/><br/>Films like this really just blow me away in every way possible. American Beauty is both hilarious and gripping, sometimes simultaneously. It possesses a script that is equally witty and laugh out loud hysterical as it is poetically and ingeniously constructed and structured. The film never leans too far to one side of its humorous and serious spectrum. There is always a dab of ironic hilarity in the serious moments, and a drop of biting sophistication in the comic scenes. This is a film where every scenes gets better and better. The film starts out with a ironically bitter attitude and the mood continues on like this, throwing in plenty of harsh satire that entertains as much as it gets you thinking. The entire story is so masterfully worked out with every character and every action contributing something to the themes of gilded beauty false images. It's also worth pointing out just how subtly these important themes are displayed throughout the film, never coming in as overbearing or blatantly obvious. Some of the messages are spelled out at times, but not without grace or poeticism. Yet the deeper meaning of this film is still excellently hidden in subtext underneath fantastic characters and an incredible story.<br/><br/>It's also worth mentioning the acting in this film. American Beauty wouldn't be the incredible movie that it is without some of the most impressive performances ever put on film. Kevin Spacey could not have played the sardonic, depressed, and hilariously bitter Lester Burnham any better. His performance is one of the few that I can confidently call perfect. He took home one of the most deserved Oscars of all time in 1999. And while Spacey carries the film so incredibly well, the supporting cast holds their own just as well. Annette Bening is incredible enticing as the deranged suburban wife and Thora Birch plays the daughter of two nut jobs so excellently. Mena Suvari as Angela, Jane's friend, is incredible, playing one of the strangest characters in a movie full of strange people. Then there is Wes Bentley and Chris Cooper as a father/son pair. Both of their performances are outstanding and the dynamic between these two characters is incredible. They create some of the most emotionally gripping scenes of the entire film which says a lot of a film that is so enthralling.<br/><br/>This is one of those rare films that works equally well when you take it at face value and when you read between the lines and think deeper into its hidden meanings. Everything about this film is excellent, and it all cultivates into one masterful final product that compels and mystifies to no end. This film is haunting in a realistically disturbing way. You will laugh, you will cry, you will be utterly blown away by American Beauty."

","I know some people are un-decided about watching this film because they say it does not live up to what we can experience in films today. Well, for me this is the exact reason I watched this masterpiece and also loved it at the same time. I'm the sort of film buff that will watch film knowing nothing about it, it's the way I like to do it. If i'm going to watch a film I want to have my own interpretation and not have IGN, Empire or my friends for that matter tell me what ""I"" should and shouldn't watch. <br/><br/>If someone has given a bad word-of-mouth about this film because it portrays ""real life and it's themes are confusing"". Well the camera work and the use of diagetic sound are there to show you that when all these little personal conflicts come together there is going to be reactions. Watch the film, make your own thoughts and as you grow older, remember the moments when felt happy most in your life. <br/><br/>A little bit of a hypocritical statement here, I would recommend this film to anyone that feels that life hasn't been quite what they wanted or not what they expected after finishing College (or High School) it's good story which could if they wanted say ""based on a true story"" because, the conflicts it provides us are real. In on way shape or form is this film sur-real or anti-realistic, yes it is a bit multi-strand. But people are stalked, people are homo-phobic and people experience a mid-life-crisis. <br/><br/>As much as I want to ramble about Kevin Spacey's inspiring performance as Lester Burnham, I want to talk about the actress that went un-noticed in the 2000 Oscars (American Beauty was 1999 film meaning the Oscars for that year were in 2000, just in case you didn't know) Annette Bening. I hate to say it but it is true, the Academy made a mistake. The major moments with Annette could contend with the major moments with Kevin, the last shot which resonates with through neighbourhood, Alan can't help but edit these perfect moments in which we see everyone's lives effected, all though it doesn't actually show it is implied in the sub- text, the lake of sound and camera work. Also to notice is the mise-en- scene, each character has their own moment of isolation where all their possessions mean nothing to them and realise that they are in control of their own lives. Most notably to the focused character of Lester Burnham how he finally has the courage to do all the things he wanted to do, funny how this film portrays a man seizing control only when he's lost everything that in some cases mean more people in real life. <br/><br/>So before you go throwing plates of asparagus and buying a brand new Pontiac fire-birds because you think i'm talking a load bull. I suggest next time you watch this or the first time you watch this film. Try and digest what Alan Ball is trying to show you, when your life is at its worst, take a step back and have a look around at what you are missing. Let's just say I could write about 10pages on this film (oh wait, I have already!) if you haven't yet discovered, this is my favourite film of all time, and I understand why the message can spark a distasteful feeling towards it, but please for me go back and sit through it if you can and concentrate on the final zoom out crane shot, there's a lot of world and a lot of problems, you cannot hide from them. Brilliant film."
"marloes_vm","9","1","2","1 June 2011"," True Beauty
","American Beauty is one of a kind. Words cannot describe this movie. Although the title might suggest it's some sort of typical chick flick, it certainly isn't.<br/><br/>The story is set in a perfect neighborhood in America. Lester and Carolyn Burnham, acted by Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, look like the perfect couple with a perfect daughter Jane, acted by Thora Birch. Lester is in his mid-life crisis, in love with his daughter's friend Angela, acted by Mena Suvari. Lester hates his job, his wife is bitchy and his daughter Jane does not love him. In addition, Jane is interested in the boy next door: Ricky, who is dealing drugs and who likes to film things and events that he thinks are beautiful but which look strange to a lot of people. Ricky has a very strict father from the army who dislikes gay people and who thinks Lester and Ricky are a couple, while they are actually dealing drugs.<br/><br/>The acting is excellently done and with a lot of exaggeration which lets us identify ourselves with the characters. American Beauty has a lot of small patterns and subtle moments in it. A small example of this is that Carolyn, Lester's wife is throughout the film compared to a full grown rose while Angela, Lester's crush and Jane's best friend is covered in rose petals when Lester dreams about her. This might suggest that Carolyn is the person Angela might become in a few years time or that Angela actually is like Carolyn was, before she let herself be led by greediness. These sorts of small things you find throughout the whole story. This makes the story interesting. Even if you watch it multiple times because every time you discover something new. All these small details make this an entertaining movie to watch.<br/><br/>There aren't a lot of special effects used in this movie but there isn't any need for it either. The special effects are mostly used in the dream and fantasy sections of the father, Lester. These are the scenes in which he fantasizes about Angela, the friend of his daughter Jane. The rose peddles symbolize the social barrier between Lester and Angela but they also symbolize beauty, which is one of the most important themes in the American Beauty. The special effects are used to make clear it is just a fantasy and the thoughts of one person.<br/><br/>This film makes you think about life and fills your head with many thoughts about human behavior. American Beauty has a thoughtful message coming with it. Live your life honest and pure and everything will be alright. This is also shown by Ricky filming beauty. He can see beauty in Jane, his girlfriend but also in a plastic bag floating in the wind. Beauty is the most important aspect of this movie. In the movie they show that beauty isn't what we are taught to see as beautiful but true beauty could be found in the most simple and normal things and that these little things should be appreciated.<br/><br/>It also shows that nothing is what it looks like. For example from a distance you might think Lester would be very happy having a wife, a daughter and a job. Then when you take a closer look, he seems to be much less happy than you would think. This also relates to the tag line of the film again 'Look closer..' We thought the American beauty was an outstanding film. It has an excellent storyline which was simple but had enough twists. The acting was great. This movie really sets you to think. We would recommend this film to everybody."

","This will probably be one of the only times I will give a movie a perfect 10. Not only was this film brilliantly made with a perfect cast, but overall i was moved me in a way I have never been moved before. First of all, Kevin Spacey was amazing! Funny, passionate, engaging, and a perfect fit for the part. Well deserved Oscar. And I must say the rest of the cast was near perfect as well. But more importantly, the film overall was a masterpiece. Aside from the suspenseful story line, which certainly keeps you guessing and engaged throughout the film, the overall message the movie was trying to deliver was more about soul searching and reexamining what you live for. I know that may sound cliché, but the way this movie delivers this message is artistic, comedic, deep, and in the end, has you truly appreciating life in a new light. The line at the end of the movie sums up its message more perfectly than i could have ever put into words: <br/><br/>""I guess I could be pretty p***** off about what happened to me, but it's hard to stay mad when there's so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much. My heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst. And then I remember to relax, and stop trying to hold on to it. And then it flows through me like rain. And I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life. You have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm sure. But don't worry, you will someday."""

","American beauty is a reality drama film, telling the story of a middle aged man, Lester Burnham, going through the mid life crisis. <br/><br/>In Lester's own words, the midlife crisis felt to Lester as if he ""was in a coma for 20 years, and just now waking up"". <br/><br/>The films starts with Lester's introducing the audience to his life, telling how unhappy he is, and vaguely announcing that he will be dead in less than a year.<br/><br/>Lester suffers from the distance he feels growing between him and his family; wife, Carolyn Burnham (Annette Benning), and daughter Jane Burnham (Thora Birch). <br/><br/>Similarly, he feels that he is valueless at work, although he has been working for the same firm for the last fourteen years. <br/><br/>On the personal level, we see no friends in his life, adding more to his isolation and boredom. <br/><br/>Faced with all of these factors, Lester decides that it's time to take matters in his own hands, and gain back control of his own life. <br/><br/>In his journey to gain this control of his life, he quits his job, changes his car, starts smoking weed, working out and eating right, partially in effort to attract his daughter's teenager friend. <br/><br/>Along comes a new resident to his street, Col. Fits USMC (Chris Cooper) and his family. His son Ricky Fits (who is an undercover drug dealer) starts dating Jane. <br/><br/>The unhappy wife with the recent changes is now cheating on Lester, while the over protective off his family Col. Fits is concerned with his son's behavior. <br/><br/>Lester's efforts to attract the teenager friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) are eventually successful, just to find out that she is a clueless child. <br/><br/>As Lester promised at the intro of the film, he gets murdered at the closing scene, over a very ironic misunderstanding, audience tends to be upset over what happened, but Lester's voice reassures them, that it's not worth it; he is now able to see true beauty in life, and ""it's hard to stay mad when there is so much beauty in the world."" <br/><br/>The plot and the entire movie scenes remained faithful to the movie theme, as a realistic drama film with a glimpse of sarcastic humor. There was no impossible (physically or emotionally) events in the entire film, in fact, the film came so plausible and realistic, a similar scenario can happen anywhere anytime across the united states, and thus, it was titles American Beauty."

","American Beauty is an amazing film. It has been masterfully written by Six Feet Under's Alan Ball, as a quirky yet serious take on American lives and what goes on behind closed doors.<br/><br/>This film is beautiful to look at; when it needs to be. It uses bright red color to symbolize seduction and other important ideas, communicated through superb direction from British director Sam Mendes and exceptional actors such as Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening.<br/><br/>American Beauty shows that other people's lives are not always how we see them. Even if we know someone well, their lives are still surrounded by mystery. For the Burnhams, Carolyn is a joyful and ambitious real estate agent, Jane is a typical teenage cheerleader and Lester is an office worker. But this an image: the Burnhams are a family at breaking point. Jane feels alienated by her parents. Carolyn tries to cope with an unsuccessful job. Lester despises his job. Altogether, the Burnhams don't get on well with each other and can not have a conversation without an argument. Lester sums this up with his quote near the end of the film, ""Our marriage is just for show. A commercial for how normal we are when we're anything but."" This idea is shown with color and cinematography, showing bright colors outside the houses of all the characters, and darker colors inside.<br/><br/>The turning point for all the characters in the film, particularly Lester is the point where he meets Jane's friend Angela. From here on all the characters 'look closer.' Lester quits his job and experiences new freedom, being his own person and living life. Carolyn meets real estate competitor Buddy Kane, whom she begins an affair with. Jane peruses a relationship with their strange next door neighbor Ricky Fits.<br/><br/>American Beauty challenges us to live our lives to the fullest and 'look closer' at the beauty in our lives. It is amazing on all professional film levels - it has excellent cinematography, acting, directing, editing, writing...and the list goes on. It should be a decent addition to all film lovers favorite films list, and deserves its awards and place in history.<br/><br/>AMAZING 10/10"

","Every time I see a plastic bag, flying through the air, I have to think about this film, ""American Beauty"". Although I wouldn't say it's one of the greatest films I've ever seen, it left its marks on me. <br/><br/>The story about an ordinary American family in an ordinary American suburb with ordinary American jobs, whose whole life turns upside down, when the father, Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), falls in love with the beautiful friend (Mena Suvari) of his daughter Jane (Thora Birch), therefore recognizes his rotten life and tries to change it, plays with the idea of the American Dream and uncovers its unreality. <br/><br/>When Lester masturbates in the shower (and the marital bed!), when his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) totally freaks out, because she's not able to sell a house (real estate!) and their daughter Janes only problem is how to get enough money for a boob job, everyone starts to think about the ""behind the scenes"" of every all-so-lovely, perfect, suburban family. This is probably what director Sam Mendes intention was, when he exaggerated both camera work and dialogs. Because when the neighbors's boy Ricky (Wes Bentley) starts to philosophise about the beauty of a plastic bag dancing with the wind, it's on the edge between craziness and truth. But by using this concept for the whole film Mendes created a worth seeing spectacle, fitting every film evening."

","Of course I heard about this praised and many awards-winning movie before is saw it, so I was curious about seeing it to find out whether it is worth it's high rating. And as I nearly expected, it's worth it.<br/><br/>After a short foreshadowing on one of the most telling scenes of the film, the action begins with an overview on the ordinary life of Lester Burnham, the main character, who tells his story from his own grave. He is a 42-year old add-writer who is bored and annoyed of his life. His wife Carolyn, a very stressed and dainty career-addict and his daughter Jane, a highly depressed and ordinary teenager can not change his view on his life either, they only make his life even worse in his eyes.<br/><br/>His coma-like perception of his life changes all of a sudden when he gets to meet his daughter's sexy and willing friend Angela, who makes Lester get foolishly obsessed with her. Driven by his will to attract her, Lester begins to change his life by starting to work-out, quitting his job and go back to his teenage roots, which means smoking pot and while listening to rock music.<br/><br/>But Lester is not the only character who changes his life and mind during the film. All the characters go through an interesting development of character traits, so do Carolyn and Jane, and even the weird neighbor family of a freaky Boy called Ricky and a brutal and cold military man who is his father.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes really knew how to make this movie a brilliant one. The character's development is worked out very well. The way to their change of mind is understandable and surprising at the same time. The environment they life in really seems to show the reality of the ""normal"" American everyday life who sometimes tries to get one down, and the movie shows the way the characters try to fight against it.<br/><br/>So what is left at the surprising end of the amazingly profound movie is the realization that everything is not what it seems."
"vanessaesch","10","1","2","20 January 2010"," American Beauty in many ways
","Before seeing this movie I had a lot of expectations, because everyone told me this would be a great film experience. Honestly I didn't really know what was expecting me, so I was looking forward to an unique experience. As I heard we would watch this movie in our English class, I remembered my former expectations and couldn't wait seeing it.<br/><br/>And with the first second of this awesome movie I was touched and began to believe all the good words I heard before. At first American Beauty seemed to lead into a kind of Comedy performance as far as the atmosphere was presented as an ironic one. At this place I have to honour Spacey's excellent acting and credibility. He was able to make Lester Burnham, a midlife-crisis bothered and even lovely typical American dad, the most likely character of the film. This impression stayed until the very end of the film and his life.<br/><br/>At this point it's time to appreciate the other cast as well and especially the Burnham family members. Due to Bening's and Birch's credible and strong appearance, the film got this dark and special charm. Another highlight, like Lester's morning shower for him, was Mena Suvari as Jane's seemingly extroverted, but actually very shy girl, with a huge crush on Mr. Burnham who reciprocates this attraction. But although every actor and actress really impressed me, no one could reach Spacey's top performance.<br/><br/>And as if this weren't enough, cinematic genius Sam Mendes stages this every single Oscar worthy masterpiece with an ironical dark touch. Especially the end with all the excitement and electricity in the air is a real highlight in movie history. Together with some other little treasures like the symbolic roses, make it a treat."

In addition to being an update of the Lolita story(and one of the best versions), this goes into the life of suburbia, and how, on the surface, it's happy. Lester Burnham lives a dull life. When he first sees his daughter's female friend, he falls for her. Finding himself reinvigorated, he starts to go for all the things that he has denied himself. We can't stop cheering for him, because he's clearly a good guy that has been oppressed. He, and every other character in this, is brilliantly written, with several layers to them. Everyone cast is the exact right choice, and the acting is completely beyond reproach. I did not realize that Bentley was so talented, or Bening. However, I did already know that Birch, Suvari, Cooper and the impeccable Spacey had immense skill, and they certainly show it here. The dialog is excellent and the delivery is spot-on. This is well-written and well thought out. The script is marvelous. This is also hilarious, no attempt at humor falls flat, and it never tries too hard. There is something in this for anyone who is at least a teenager. This has frequent strong language, some violence and brief nudity. I recommend this to those who are mature enough for it. 10/10"

Just like life, the film is tragic and uplifting, and always underscored with a real humour and vitality. A good movie generally has a few scenes that always stand out, but it seems American Beauty seems to go from one arresting sequence to another. Whilst I have mentioned that all actors involved bring so much, Kevin Spacey is really sublime, especially in the narration.

","American Beauty is, in my opinion, one of the five best films I've ever seen. The plot seems so ordinary: a man stuck in a lifeless marriage experiences a midlife crisis and changes his lifestyle. What makes it so extraordinary then? First off, it's perfectly written. The screenplay finds an excellent balance between comedy and drama, and it's actually kind of creepy at some points (Kevin Spacey's character's obsession with Mena Suvari's goes pretty far). Just as important as the script is the acting and direction, both excellent as well. Kevin Spacey definitely earned his Academy Award as a man in despair who turns everything around.<br/><br/>American Beauty is probably the most thought-provoking movie I've ever seen. It's like a little window into your own life; it enables you to see things you may want to change about how you live or what you choose to do with your time. Each time I see it, I find myself thinking about it for days. How many movies can you say that for? But it's more than just thought-provoking; it's also hugely entertaining. The entire cast is great, and its well known that the cinematography is extraordinary. With American Beauty, you will not be seeing the ordinary film its plot outline may suggest.

What happens when you've worked your entire life to achieve this dream and you're still unfulfilled?<br/><br/>This film is an unforgettable mix of character study, social commentary and dark comedy. The husband, bored with his wife and career, quits his stressful office job to work at the local fast food restaurant and lust after his daughter's underage cheerleader friend. His wife is ridiculously frustrated by her empty career in real estate and has been carrying on an affair of her own. Their daughter is terribly maladjusted and bored with her suburban upbringing. She becomes involved with the neighbor boy who can only be described as an anti-social loner with a penchant for dealing drugs. He's driven to this behavior by his cold, overbearing parents. The seemingly ""straight shooter"" ex-military neighbor is actually a closet homosexual. The casting, writing and direction is perfect. From top to bottom, the acting performances are perfect from this diverse cast.<br/><br/>Yes, this is a dark, disturbing group of characters and the humor is on the dark side as well. Maybe this film isn't for everyone, but it's wonderful for a viewer with a philosophical mind. This is a movie for anyone who has ever stopped in the middle of the rat race to the ""American Dream"" and wondered why they were really working so hard."

","If Blue Velvet peeked behind the curtains of modern day suburbia back in 1986, thirteen years later, in 1999, American Beauty yanked them completely away from the windows and gave them an unsettling, unnerving full view of what goes on behind closed doors. ""This is my neighborhood, this is my life"", narrates Lester Burnham, and he continues ""I'm 42 years old. In less than a year, I'll be dead. Of Course I don't know that yet. In a way, I'm dead already"", like Joe Gills (William Holden) of Sunset Boulevard, Lester and the audience know his fate from the beginning, but we soon realize that this is just a small part of the plot. American Beauty is a dark portrait of suburban life. Not quite as dark as Blue Velvet, but dark enough. It is a very bleak dramedy about what life is like for those supposedly living a warped version of the American Dream. People who don't lack anything material, but are unfulfilled, unhappy, dissatisfied, lost and gradually falling apart. They need something that money cannot buy.<br/><br/>American Beauty is a funny, reassuring, wistful and sometimes hopeful portrait of American life that goes places you don't expect it will. Beautiful and brooding, American Beauty is a remarkable film that boasts stunning performances that although initially appears bleak, ends on a satisfying, positive note."

","Lester (Kevin Spacey) is a disillusioned 40 years old man. He doesn't have a good relation with his wife (Annette Bening) and his daughter (Thora Birch) hates him. After meeting Angela (Mena Suvari) his life suddenly change and he is going to feel the freedom again.<br/><br/>""American Beauty"" is definitely the most famous film of 1999, a year with many films that now are true modern classics. I really enjoyed this film and i think it has a great impact because it has common people as characters. A family of pretenders: Lester is a good man but is really unhappy because he can't be free in his family. I think he is a good man because he feel worry about his daughter but he can't communicate that to her. His daughter his unhappy too because she can't accept herself and she is always insecure. And the mother, who has to pretend that she is happy to obtain success in her work. Finally when the three meet new persons, they feel the happiness again but those persons (Angela, Ricky and Buddy King) are three pretenders too that are having a confusing time. The scene when we confirm that Lester was a true good person in when he finally can have Angela, the girl of his dreams, but suddenly he wakes up from that dream and realize that Angela is just a child, the best friend of his daughter, and he doesn't abuse of her innocence, the innocence that Angela was afraid to show. And Lester did that because of the times when he was finally happy, the happiness that ends because of the most unhappy character in the story, Col. Frank Fits,USMC.<br/><br/>About the cast: a great performance of Spacey steals the film but the rest of the cast are good too. The performance of Mena Suvari is just memorable and Thora Birch is just good, in a minor but important character. It's a fact that Thora appears more than Mena but the scenes with Mena's character and just the most famous scenes of the film.<br/><br/>Conclusion: for me the debut film of Sam Mendes is a very well written and entertaining film with a memorable Spacey and great rock music. To call it ""the best thing to happen in 20 years"" is just overrate but definitely is a worth watching film that by now every film lover of the world have already check. 8 out of 10"

","Really this is one movie that very well deserves an Oscar. Kevin Spacey was mind blowing. Each and every element is very well designed and used. Sam Mendes has proved it once again. Alan Ball has gone one step further to narrate such a a story which seriously, just blew my mind. it was spec-ta-cu-lar. The performances of each and every actor was breathtaking. I really liked the Sound Design. if you will look closely to each soundtrack, each sentence has a meaning to what is happening at the present moment in the film. The Camera work is good and the shots would just take you on a high ride. But, the main thing that pulled me back and stuck me to my seat was the ANIMATION. I am myself into animation and have great interest in Special Effects. Even in 1999, the effects are awesome. my favourite part of the film is when Kevin is dreaming of Angela and we have Rose petals all around. Here ROSE is an element and that is the beauty of Sam Mendes. Creativity doesn't have any boundaries and this Movie explains that in a very Real Life story, perfectly. IT's JUST AMAZING."

The directing by Mendes is one of the best I have ever seen in a film. The cinematography is so beautiful with the strong contrast between the red and other colors. Aside from being visually beautiful, the story itself is this film's best feature. It is original, with hints of humor, noir, drama, and sadness. Overall, it is thought-provoking in a way very few films are. It is hard to watch what these characters are doing because we know that they are only leading themselves to their own demise. Ball's screenplay is one that should be required reading in film schools and the final sequence is perhaps the most beautiful thing ever filmed. It is a stunning achievement, deserving of every award it got. It is, in my opinion, one of the 10 best films I have ever seen and the best film of the 1990s after Schindler's List.

"pwmaschek","10","1","2","25 June 2007"," Great Movie
","This is an excellent movie because it shows the dark side of modern upper-middle class suburbia. I believe one of the most important themes in this movie is the fact that the characters, especially Annette Bening's character, try to maintain ""an image of success"" at all costs. However, by doing so it leads her to a life of unhappiness. I like this theme because I know many people who act and think just like this. Also, I like Kevin Spacey's character because over the course of the movie he becomes more and more free. That is, instead of him doing what everybody wants him to do, he just does whatever he wants. For instance, he decides that he is not going to listen to his cheating wife anymore, that he is going to smoke weed, and by himself the car of his dreams. It is only after this that he becomes truly happy."
"dragonshield","8","1","2","1 June 2007"," Kevin Spacey - Need I say more?
","I remember seeing this film back in the year 2000 or so and as I didn't remember so much about it, I decided to have another go and I watched it again two days ago, after 7 years. I actually remembered a lot more than I thought, which was a shame really as I seemed to remember all the crucial parts which were significant for the whole plot. Anyway, it is still a great movie and I can imagine it is one of those movies you can watch all over again, as it's just so easy to watch. The movie itself tells a stereotypical story of a middle aged man named Lester Burnham and how his life is pretty much as boring as it gets. His daughter and wife thinks he's a loser and he also pretty much agrees with that. He's depressed, but suddenly one day he feels this desire of love and another life when he sees his daughter Jane's friend Angela for the first time. He decides to turn his life around and finally start living it.<br/><br/>To be honest, the beginning arrangements of the plot aren't so original. There has been so much movies with a middle aged man who's in a life crisis and decides to take over his life and so on and so on. Despite that, this movie actually does it in a pretty good way and the whole storyline is so brilliant when it builds up. It's hilarious and it's dramatic, both well done and in the same package. It's not just the story which makes it so good, it's the characters who are pretty much stereotypical yet performed by an amazing cast. I've been watching a lot of Kevin Spacey -movies recently and I must say that the role of Lester Burnham is one of the best fitting roles I've seen him doing. He's just so excellent in the role and he even got a well deserved Academy Award of it. There's just something about Kevin Spacey I like, I don't know if it's the whole personality and substance or is it that perfect, I wouldn't say monotonic, but a flat voice which just has this certain charisma and credibility. Spacey also narrates the movie as Lester and the voice and the way he speaks is just so superb when you're looking at the whole main theme of the movie. Kevin Spacey is without a doubt the best thing the movie has to offer.<br/><br/>The man responsible for the music is Thomas Newman, who I haven't heard composing even anything near average, his music is always top notch no matter what the movie was. I'd say there are two different music themes in ""American Beauty"", one taking place when the funny comedic scenes take part and the other one being beautiful and slow when the dramatic scenes take part. The music sort of transports the whole movie forward, being so necessary for the plot as well. I shouldn't just praise Spacey's performance yet he surely takes the cake by far. Like I mentioned before, the whole cast is amazing. Lester's wife Carolyn played by Annette Bening, who I really haven't enjoyed as much as in ""American Beauty"". Being a total hypocrite dreaming of a better luxurious life it makes the role of Carolyn a spot on for Bening. Then there's Thora Birch as Lester's daughter Jane, who's an insecure teenager, Wes Bentley as Ricky Fits the real estate king and Mena Suvari as the school's dream girl and Jane's friend Angela who Lester fixes his eyes on. It was also a pleasant surprise to see Scott Bakula in a so surreal role as one of the gay neighbours after seeing him constantly on the cult classic ""Quantum Leap"".<br/><br/>Although the movie being very good I think it still is pretty overrated. There's actually nothing particularly unique in the movie, expect those amazing role performances. It really doesn't offer anything mind blowing as even when it has originality it still is more like a stereotypical image of life seen many times on the screen. I wouldn't say I'm bored of it, but more like just wanting someone to invent something really new and unique even when having stereotypical beginning arrangements on the plot. This movie is a pretty good achievement in that category but like said it still isn't as unique as you could imagine. This might be just because I had seen the movie before and I remembered all the twists of the plot unconsciously. It's a real pity as this might have been a total different review if I'd seen it for the first time. Somehow it still manages to be a great movie and despite me jumping all over the negative and positive sides of the movie it still is a definite recommendation and because of the flow it is really easy to watch. Kevin Spacey is starting to be one of my all time favourite actors and not just because of this movie, but the amazing work he always does."

"ladnerdude","10","1","2","1 May 2007"," American Beauty
","In order to grasp the hard concepts of American Beauty we need to get an understanding of what the charters in the movie are like. The Burnham's and the Fits's are the two main families. These two families may seem like polar opposites but in actuality are the same. To the outside world, the Burnham family is happy everyday American family living the American dream. As we learn through the very detailed movie is that is not quite the truth. The truth is that the Burnham family is fake and that that Lester, Carolyn's husband, is just for show, and that Carolyn isn't faithful to her husband. We learn that Jane hates her parents, and that they she is like every other teenager, ""Janie's a pretty typical teenager. Angry, insecure, confused. I wish I could tell her that's all going to pass, but I don't want to lie to her."" (Lester Burnham narrating) Compared this to the Fits's family were the father is a marine colonel and is an angry man. His son Ricky is a distributed person who might me the most liberated person through out the whole movie or at least till the end. Barbra Fits the wife to Col. Fits, and Mother to Ricky, is a 40 something woman who never will be liberated. We presume that Barbra has gone through years of emotional abuse. You also have supporting rolls Jane's best friend Angela Hayes, Angela Hayes a girl everyone thinks is lose but in actuality she isn't. <br/><br/>American beauty is dismissed by some as a ""bad film"" ""For nay-sayers, American Beauty is simply another version of the numbingly familiar story of individual liberation from social convention, with a few extra elements of sensationalism thrown in to up the commercial ante (masturbation! recreational drugs! borderline pedophilia!)"" Others have said that ""American Beauty, in my view however, is fool's gold. I would suggest that those who respond enthusiastically to the film are wither settling for far too little or, in the impatience for substantive material, are engaging in wishful thinking and largely inventing the film they would like to see madeThe clichés too are tedious. Why must the marine colonel be ramrod stiff and a repressed homosexual? This seems too familiar and too easy. There must be such figures with other, perhaps more highly evolved problems. Is it particularly fresh and original to reveal the apparently promiscuous Angela to be frightened, over-compensating virgin? Things we've seen before, countless times in other films, are simply shuffled around."" <br/><br/>People say its good; don't realize the in-depth symbolism and the ever lasting realization of setting yourself free. Finally the major theme with the old saying ""doesn't judge a book by its cover."" ""It is a wonderful psychological drama, a satire about the American community and about the American life; dark, painful irony and cynicism in the descriptions of life and characters; deep sarcasm on types of people in the community, habits of behavior such as ""...if you want to succeed, you always have to seem successful..."" or ""never stop smiling"", parasites of the community, and, most importantly, the treatment of people who are ""different"", who are ""freaky"" to some extent; and eventually, there is no character in the film that is not odd in its way, although we have to wait for the very ending of the film, to discover this."" In order to start looking at this in-depth film we must start at the begging, with one of the best opening lines in film of all time. ""My name is Lester Burnham. This is my neighborhood; this is my street; this is my life. I am 42 years old; in less than a year I will be dead. Of course I don't know that yet, and in a way, I am dead already."" With this line we learn that the downfall of Lester has already begun, and this downfall will subsequently lead to his untimely death. At the start of the movie we learn that Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a 42 year old man living what seems like an ordinary life, but is from an ordinary life. We learn that Lester's home life is what people would consider normal, we learned that his wife (Carolyn) and him have not been happy in years and that his daughter (Jane). Throughout the movie, Lester is trying to get with Jane's ""bff"" (best friend) Angela Hayes, Angela a 16 year old cheerleader. By the end he does, and that's when the role of not judging a book by its cover comes in as he learns out that Angela is not a promiscuous person, and that she is anything but that, for she is a virgin. This concedes with another important part of the tale with Jane, meeting Ricky Fits, Ricky who is anything but normal, and people find him a outcast, finds true love with Jane. We also realize that Ricky was most likely the most liberated person in the begging of the film but by the end him and Jane would both be UN-liberated. Then we get to Carolyn story, of having a unfair life, and has more interest in material things, then actual family. With this in mind she ends of cheating on Lester, with ""THE REALSTATE KING"" (Buddy Kane) Finally we get to the person who kills Lester with a single gun shot to the back of the head. Col. Frank Fits USMC, from the begging of the film we are to believe that Col. Fits beats his son, and is a tough man, and is anti gay! But this is not true, in actuality Col. Fits is a closeted gay, and when he kisses Lester, (he saw Ricky and Lester doing ""things"" that looked like Ricky was giving Lester a blow-job) and his secret is revealed and not only is it revealed but that, Lester rejected him, Col. Fits kills Lester in order to hide the truth."

Pitch-perfect dialogue, superb acting, and outstanding technical aspects. The story's a bit abstract but I really liked it. Kevin Spacey gives perhaps his best performance and Annette Bening is just as good. The kids aren't the typical annoying teenagers - probably because the actors are twentysomethings, not teens - and feel completely natural in these roles. Superb direction from Mendes and some great cinematography. Very funny at times, and quite sad at the end.

Do you know why? Because its extremely truthful, Almost harshly.<br/><br/>It all starts with Lester Burnham(played immaculately by Kevin Spacey) a middle aged man who's going through a midlife crisis, having to put up with his money desperate, socialite wife(Annete Bening) and his teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch). He feels that he cannot surprise himself anymore, as one can in youth. A midlife crisis is also a time when he will likely be feeling anxieties about his attractiveness to the opposite sex. but oh boy, is he going to get a shock...<br/><br/>the movie gets knocked up a notch when Angela Hayes comes into the scene(Mena Suvari) and very quickly Lester is starting to fantasize about her. But through the film, following all the revelations, such as the drug dealing boy Ricky Fits, and his homophobic father, the chain of events which occur involving all these people increase Lesters sense of freedom. Angela shows Lester that anyone can surprise themselves at how they feel, no matter what age they are. Ricky however, brings up the main point the movie is making. Look closer. You cannot see all the beauty in this world if you do not look for it. Both Angela and Carolyn (his wife) hide themselves behind a façade of beauty and success, but inside they feel different. Like when Lester is about to get out his winker for Angela, believing she is not a virgin, when she reveals that she, in fact is, Lester gets back his sense. He knows that he doesn't really want to take away the virginity of a girl half his age, and now feels satisfied. Because he has looked closer, and seen that Angela is not all that she appears to be.<br/><br/>Much like the homophobe father, colonel fits. After he ""looks closer"", he sees what appears as Ricky ""testing out Lesters magic monk"" is really them dealing marijuana. But then, we find out the CO himself is actually gay, or a ""faggot"" and ""cocksucker"" as he would call it, and now Lester has ""looked closer""!<br/><br/>What I mean is that you have to look closer to see the real person, the real world etc. you have to look for beauty, not just sit around and wait for it to come to you.Lester realises this when death comes to take him, just how beautiful this world is, and the things in it, he just had to open his eyes to it. And you can find the beauty in this film, and it is a truly great beauty.<br/><br/>All you have to do is look closer."

","Kevin Spacey stars in ""American Beauty"" as Lester Burnham, a man unknowingly living the last year of his life. His life looks nothing like the one he had envisioned for himself, with an overbearing and distant wife, a teenage daughter who can't stand the sight of him, and a job he's being forced out of by fascist-like tactics. Before long Lester rediscovers a sense of control and empowerment over his own destiny. What follows is a film that makes film-making look easy, as it moves slowly and deliberately through a well-told and intelligent examination of suburban America.<br/><br/>""American Beauty"" was released in 1999, the same year as David Fincher's brilliant ""Fight Club"". Both films explore similar themes of mortality, identity, and the male psyche. However Fincher's film played these themes within the context of a far darker canvas, and was therefore given a cold shoulder in its initial release. Given the tastes of mainstream America, the fact that a dark satire in the vein of ""American Beauty"" would be embraced enough to win a best picture Oscar is impressive. Thematic nature aside, pitting ""American Beauty"" against ""Fight Club"" would steadily become an apple versus oranges scenario. So it should be fair to state that both are similarly themed significant works of art and ""American Beauty"" was given the opportunity to win several well-deserved awards, including an Oscar for first-time director Sam Mendes and first-time screenwriter Alan Ball."

His wife Caroline is also a loser who makes everything match, always attempts to look her best, attempts to make everything around her look its best, and tries to put everything in a neat and orderly fashion as she holds on to her real estate business by a thread. There daughter Janie who is angry, bitter, and always takes s hit from her best friend, can also be considered a loser. I'm sorry if I'm sounding mean but this is how they are presented.<br/><br/>When new neighbors move across the street a stir of events occur (this has nothing to do with that, they are not supernatural) that include Lester falling in love with Janie's best friend while he works out, rebels against authority, makes risky moves, smokes dope and does whatever he wants to do just like when he was in his twenties. Caroline begins to cheat on her husband with a wealthy real estate agent and begins to empower herself against her husband. Janie falls in love with the new neighbor kid who films things that are beautiful and he falls in love with her.<br/><br/>With this plot set up I have presented you, this movie could've been about a bunch of messed up losers. Instead, every character is presented in a very human and real way that makes you understand their motivations and somehow know them. You understand the beauty behind every little thing in the film, nothing is over-exaggerated, they don't overwhelm you with metaphors or put too much into one character and not enough into the other. ""American Beauty"", in itself, is like a rose.<br/><br/>The real genius come at the end. It wraps up in a series of events that are brilliantly plotted, and the outcome is so tragic it is stunning; but even after this tragedy, you feel like your in a sea of happiness and eternal bliss and that's all due to Lester's final monologue as you see what truly happened. Sometimes there is so much beauty in the world you can't be mad at anything and when all this beauty builds up the only result is a sea of happiness.<br/><br/>""American Beauty"" shows us the beauty in life and inspires us to just look a little closer. 'Tis very rare for a film to have a climax so sad but a conclusion so beautiful."

","American Beauty is such an amazing movie! The drama, the comedy everything was just beautiful. Beautiful written and great actors.<br/><br/>This movie made you laugh at just how crazy the characters are and it makes you feel bad for them because they are so over the top crazy. I love the way it begins with the main character saying, ""within the year I will be dead"".<br/><br/>There is no movie out there like this. The characters are excellently written. You really buy the ruined marriage, the angry selfish daughter, the crazy stalker neighbor, and the object of the father's affections. No other movie has all these crazy together in the same movie.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, you have no idea what you are missing. I say go rent it and after you first watch it you'll want to go buy it. I promise."
"MRavenwood","8","1","2","1 February 2007"," Superb Acting - Intense Drama
","In many ways this movie is dark, but ultimately a bittersweet story. It seems to be about Maintaining Appearances within what the American culture calls ""the Rat Race"". The endless cycle of fighting to survive and achieve. Striving to be excellent, unique, ""exceptional"" and recognized for being so. And, as the term implies, remaining unsatisfied. ""The office"" and High School are the two theatres in which the characters inter-twine to meet their challenges.<br/><br/>The film focuses on four core characters: A husband and wife, their daughter and her ""weird"" boyfriend, plus the boyfriend's militant father and her gorgeous girlfriend from school. Simultaneous to the strivings for success is examination of the drive to find someone to care about and who loves the REAL you. It isn't a ""happy"" film, but it points out some possible outcomes on the way to striving for happiness.<br/><br/>There are very dramatic and violent scenes and ""amplified"" characters that jam a lot of conflict and revelation into the conclusion of the film. There is no ""Hollywood ending"", but there is resolution.<br/><br/>As far as a parental guide, I would say it's too thematically sophisticated to be appreciated fully by children under 17. The violence and emotional turmoil is too real and not cartoon-y for kids of an impressionable age. Not for the G-rated family! There is open drug use, non-marital sex scenes, implied homosexual sex, strong language, violence, and disturbing situations. But it's a great movie!"
"pyrocitor","10","1","2","20 January 2007"," Beauty in the least likely of places
","To start this review, it would seem potent to almost recommend that you don't read it, unless you have already seen the film. For full effect, despite the tales of of praise and greatness the film has attracted, it's still far more rewarding to enter the experience with a relatively open mind - to simply sit back, and let the story, characters and each little intricacy wash over you, making your own assessments. Fear not - you will not be disappointed. <br/><br/>At first glance, American Beauty might appear to be just another one of those ""realistic and touching portrait of an average family"" films which continually seem to coax far more awards out of the Academy than they are worth. No. Stop that train of thought right there. Because American Beauty may be a portrait of a family, yes, but it keeps up no pretenses of normalcy - rather how ""normalcy"" is a quality only represented through elaborate fronts to hide how excessively abnormal most families are, and how, quite frankly, it makes them far more interesting and compelling. <br/><br/>The film's tagline ""...look closer"" for once manages to overcome the pretentious glitz of most promotional material, and actually serves as a suggestion when viewing the film. At first, the characters may seem mere archetypes, simply passed off as ""messed up"" or ""weird"", but honestly, such a judgement can never truthfully be made until this simply masterful portrayal has reached its conclusion, as new lights are shone on this incredibly elaborate and painfully genuine web of characters. Each character in the film, without exception, appears noticeably flawed, yes, but out of their flaws, real people emerge, complete with the depth and personal intricacies which movies are so seldom able to capture. Never once does the film ring of anything except absolute truth - these are real people we are watching here, and that is what makes them so compelling, unsavoury qualities and all. <br/><br/>Director Sam Mendes (winner of the best director Oscar) kick started his now stellar career with this one of a kind masterpiece. Working with screenwriter Alan Ball (who also won an Oscar), who allegedly wrote the script as a play first (the influence shows throughout) Mendes is able to show remarkable depth, and rather than passing judgement on any of the players, simply presents them as they are, making stereotyping and assumptions impossible. But apart from the remarkable truth Mendes is able to retain from his actors, he also demonstrates a wonderfully artistic touch, and an almost unparalleled flair for innovative cinematography, which justifiably also took home an Academy Award. The recurring motive of roses is simply unforgettable, and although it may seem bizarre at first, there is no denying the unquestionable beauty - much like the rest of the film, in effect. <br/><br/>Perhaps the one of the best and most truthful ensemble casts to grace the screen in ages, we never once see actors on-screen but merely the characters they inhabit so completely. Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his career, perfectly essaying every inch of Lester Burnham, and turning what might have been passed off as a typical mid-life crisis into something extraordinarily vivid, his usual charisma glinting between nearly closed eyes. It's unlikely that halfway through the film a single viewer will have not had the urge to strangle Annette Benning's Carolyn Burnham, which is a testament to how well she inhabited the role of the superficial, possessive wife. Yet by the end of the film, once again, judgement is reserved as she, as well as the rest of the characters, instigates a complete change in our opinions - the film culminates with no real villains, Carolyn included. Thora Birch gives a subdued yet charismatic performance as the family's troubled daughter, and Wes Bently is simply superb as the offbeat next-door neighbour, with a twisted yet genuine appreciation for beauty. Mena Suvari of American Pie fame is a noteworthy presence as the young girl who attracts Lester's attention, and Chris Cooper truly shines, there is no better word for it, as the painfully uptight and traditional military father of Wes Bently's character. <br/><br/>All in all, American Beauty is one of the strongest character studies to grace the screen in recent memory, and arguably in film history, deserving every Oscar and award it achieved. Still, the enormous amounts of praise the movie has attracted aside, it's still surprising how affecting the movie actually is, and how incessantly it sticks with you, days, weeks, months after its initial viewing. Safe to say, this is one for the ages, and if you have yet to experience American Beauty - don't be afraid to. It may appear uninteresting and stereotypical, but upon closer inspection... beauty can be found in the most unexpected places.<br/><br/>-10/10"

","This film is one of the greatest movies ever made. It is an instant classic that brings up some highly emotional and controversial issues. It shows some touchy subjects of extortion, drugs, homosexuality, love, hate, and death. The film is well directed and is very moving. I love the opening sequence, just the narrating monologue, it is spoken quite well by Kevin Spacey, so, here it is, ""My name is Lester Burnham. This is my street. This is my neighborhood. This is my life. I am 42 years old. In less than a year, I will be dead. Of course, I don't know that yet, and in a way, I'm dead already. Look at me, jerking off in the shower. This will be the highlight of my day. It's all downhill from here. That's my wife Carolyn. See the way the handle on those pruning shears match her gardening clogs? That's not an accident. That's our neighbor, Jim, and that's his lover, Jim. Man, Iget exhausted just watching her. She wasn't always like this. She used to be happy. We used to be happy. My daughter, Jane. Only child. Janie's a pretty typical teenager: angry, insecure, confused. I wish I could tell her that's all going to pass...but I don't want to lie to her. Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic loser. And in a way, they're right. I have lost something. I'm not exactly sure what, but I know I didn't always feel this...sedated.

","I really loved this movie... I think this movie really shows the world that one has to enjoy his life while he still can. there is one thought that crossed my mind though... besides the obvious reasons, why do you think Lester was killed in the end? I just would like to know other people's opinions... I think that although the movie is trying to show that many Americans really have to rethink their ways of living and approaching their styles of life, it will take a lot of time... and it actually might not even happen... Lester is a perfect example. He gets rid of the chains and tries to enjoy his life and look what happens - he's getting killed. Is the movie trying to tell us that American society is not ready to cool down a bit and try to find some time to smell the roses? What do you think are the other reasons behind killing Lester (i do realize that US marine wasn't happy about what he thought was going between Lester and his son)? thanks"

","The film chronicals Lester Burnham, a depressed suburban father in a mid-life crisis, decides to turn his hectic life around after developing an infatuation for his daughter's Lolita-like attractive friend.<br/><br/>No film has created a bigger advance stir than American Beauty, and, for once, the product lives up to its buzz. The film is a dynamite comedy-drama and along with ""Eyes Wide Shut"", ""Girl, Interrupted"", ""Election"" and ""Boys Don't Cry"", the best films of 1999. It's so daring and original that it would've been impossible to predict how it would do commercially back in 1999. On the surface, it's such an uncompromisingly bleak look at the hollowness of the American Dream and suburbia that audiences may just turn off to it and masse. But it's also hilarious, directed with a breathtaking flair (Sam Mendes who directed last years Jarhead) and fuelled by a career-defining performance from Kevin Spacey and Anette Benning. It also rises above its darkness to make an affirmation of life that's so exquisite it's hard to resist.<br/><br/>On the surface, American Beauty is a brilliantly acted and inventive satire, with an amazingly perfect supporting cast that includes Thora Birch and Mena Suvuri. One of thing I found strange about the film was it's similarity to Ang Lee's bitter and amazingly brilliant ""The Ice Storm"" (released two years earlier), despite the former being a more realistic tke on American life; none the less American Beauty was still a flat-out masterwork (with a few flaws), I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>9.8/10 <br/><br/>See It If You Liked: The Ice Storm, Happiness, The Virgin Suicides and Blue Velvet"

","""American Beauty"" is an ironic piece of art. It is a story of a family who seems to be just an average American family but no-one knows their life's are just a charade.<br/><br/>""American Beauty"" is the greatest directorial debut there is. From unknown theater director to celebrated Oscar-winner is quite impressive. Sam Mendes lives the American dream. Unfortunately his characters on the film are far from it.<br/><br/>Lester Burnham (Just phenomenal Kevin Spacey) is a 42-year-old man who gets fired from his job. Lester realizes that he has lived just a half-life. He starts to do everything he has always wanted to do. His marriage to Annie (Annette Bening) who works at the real estate business has stuck in a rut for quite some time. His daughter Jane (Thora Birch) hates his guts. They used to be a perfect family. Now everything has started to fall apart. Everything is just the beginning of the end.<br/><br/>Mendes reflects a picture of modern day problems; affairs, drug abuse, homosexuality, living in denial etc. The topics are universal and can be seen anywhere in the world. Thanks to Alan Ball's (also the creator of the TV-series ""Six Feet Under"") magnificent script which makes ""American Beauty"" as beautiful as it is with a lot of black humor.<br/><br/>Looking at Lester and his life you can see he is suffering from a mid-life crisis which has been waiting just behind the corner. He starts to live the long lost youth. While Lester is discovering his life he doesn't know that he has got a few enemies along his path finding happiness. It is very ironic and somewhat sad.<br/><br/>The performances are mind blowing. Kevin Spacey makes an once in a lifetime role as troubled Lester. Annette Bening is insanely hilarious as playing the frustrated wife. Chris Cooper blew me away with his strong performance as tough ex-marine, Burham's neighbor Mr.Fits.<br/><br/>The music in the film is very describing. When Lester sings ""American Woman"" by Lenny Kravitz in his car or Annie is raving with ""Don't Rain On My Parade"" is the Classic of classics. Those songs reflect each of this married couples thoughts. Thomas Newman has composed so beautiful music that I had to get the soundtrack to my collection.<br/><br/>""American Beauty"" is one of the best movies in 21th century. I never will forget the paper bags breath taking beautiful dance in the wind! As Pete Towsend sings in the song ""The Seeker"": ""I won't get to get what I'm after 'til the day I die..."""

","I was surprised to read a comment here about how great this movie was. Were we watching the same movie? The sheer domestic violence, the peeping tom and the drugs were bad enough. What bothered me the most was the constant hostile nature this movie had the whole time. Then the crazy neighbor ex-marine who abused that boy who liked Jane and then tried to have sex later in the film with Jane's Father? Just when you think some sanity will enter the story as the father looks at a picture of the family lovingly, he is shot in the head by the mother. This movie was completely disturbing and bad for the viewers mindset. I give 2 stars only because the father stopped himself from having sex with his Daughter's virgin friend."

","An interesting and sometimes not great story of a man's rise back to life that turns the lives of those closest to him upside down.<br/><br/>Lester Burnham is clinically depressed and has lost all faith in life. His wife, Carol, is a real estate agent who brings home the most bacon in the family and is rivals with another real estate king named Buddy Kane. His daughter, Janie, is 16 and thinks of her dad as an embarrassing dork. Lester also hates his job and wishes to be closer to his daughter, but the effort is minimal.<br/><br/>One night, Carol and Lester go to Janie's school to watch her cheer-leading on the basketball team. It is there that Lester becomes hypnotized and entranced by cheerleader Angela Hayes, Janie's 17 year old friend who brags about the men she's slept with. Lester continually has fantasies about Angela, not so much of an affair but just fantasies.<br/><br/>Wanting to impress Angela more. Lester quits his job, begins working out to gain muscle, and takes a job at a fast food joint, flipping burgers, in an effort to not only impress Angela but to change his life. He also begins smoking weed, which he gets from his 18 year old neighbor, Ricky Fits. Ricky sells weed and uses fake urine from a nurse to give to his colonel dad in order to pass his dad's twice a year drug test and his mom is like a zombie around the house. Ricky also takes a liking to Janie and he also films things that are dead and gross but considers them beautiful.<br/><br/>Lester's new outlook on life makes him happy but makes his wife angry and she begins to have an affair with Buddy Kane and when Lester finds out he's not at all upset because he can only think of Angela. Janie sees this and thinks her dad is a pervert causing more friction between the two.<br/><br/>As the conclusion draws near, more hearts are broken, romance fizzles and sizzles, confrontations are addressed, revelations are found out, and a life is taken.<br/><br/>American Beauty wasn't great. It seemed to have to much swearing and sex references than good filming. It did have some funny and interesting points. For many this was great for them. For me it wasn't. It wasn't all entirely bad just not great. Kevin Spacey does give a great performance, Sam Mendes does great directing, and the story is filled with odd yet complex characters."

","Ahh, the joys of middle age. I remember a day at work, when a customer referred to an old gray haired guy who had waited on him. I didn't know who he was talking about; then it dawned on me; he was talking about me. Middle aged men, like Kevin Spacey, do have these fantasies from time to time. The girl in question is so unapproachable and so unconquerable, it should never have been an issue. In the meantime, we have the guy next door, with the hangups and his sexual identity issues. It's a sick mix. It's intriguing, but who would want to be there? Of course, marriages begin to fall apart, people begin to try to be what they are not, and the dominoes start to tumble with great dispatch. Someone is going to get hurt; someone may even die. Like Gene Wilder in ""The Woman in Red"" if our lives ended right now, it may be worth it. Unfortunately, tomorrow is another day. What were we thinking? Is this bravery or foolishness or madness or hormones or what? The sense of betrayal that filters through everything puts a pall over the ether. <br/><br/>The acting is excellent. This movie is so intense and so absorbing, you can't take your eyes off it, like a traffic accident. I don't feel better for having seen it, but it's a sign of our time in life."

","My mom saw this movie and didn't care for it much so I was a little bit scared to watch it. I hate watching a crappy movie. This movie is a bit different from typical movies out there. But I think it's good because it makes you think about your life. <br/><br/>The scene with the bag on film was interesting. To me, the guy said that it was the most beautiful thing to him in the world. It's probably beautiful because it's totally free while ""dancing through the air."" No body or no one could hold the bag down. Everyone in the movie seems to be confined and held down by different aspects in their lives.<br/><br/>Over the entire movie Kevin Spacey is struggling with his life. As the movie progresses he seems to becoming more comfortable, free, and happy with his life. He no longer cares what his Bitch of a wife thinks, nor what his boss thinks. Some people in life go along being pushed around by others. This shows us why it is important to live life to the fullest.<br/><br/>One other thing that I wanted to comment on was why, maybe, the houses were always so dull and black and white. I think the houses represent some of the characters in the film. Their lives were so cut and dry (like the houses were black and white). The characters couldn't seem to get out of their old habits and may never become ""free"" with themselves.<br/><br/>I think everyone needs to give this movie at least a try. It might open your eyes to the way you live your life. It's a beautiful piece of cinematography thats for sure."

","American Beauty is a remarkable film because it puts a sympathetic face on all of the different ways that people cover up the pain in their lives.

The film makes us look closer in a way that makes us think we will enjoy some simple salacious comeuppance, but we realize that things are not as simple as we believe.<br/><br/>Although Lester Burnham's midlife crisis forms the thread that binds the film together, each of the other characters' stories is equally important to look at more closely.

","The debut film of director Sam Mendes was an outstanding satire and was one of the last great works of art of the twentieth century. It tells the story of a tragic hero named Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) who realizes that there is something missing in his life but cannot tell precisely what. He quits his job, blackmails his boss and even resorts to drugs. Tragically, he realizes too late that he has taken for granted what is truly important in life. When I gave a valedictory address at my high school graduation I talked about what is important in life, what is not and knowing the difference. I used this character as an example of both how to look at the world and how not to behave. Indeed, we must try to take a world view more akin to that of Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley), the heart and soul of American Beauty, who finds beauty everywhere.

I can't help but think that most of the bad reviews of this film come from people who live the type of life that it somewhat parodies (i.e. ""I live in the perfect town, with a perfect house, and a perfect career, and a perfect child"")...

","Lester has hit a crisis in life. Unappreciated at work, his marriage with Carolyn falling apart; the intimacy has disappeared with a non-existent sex life. His daughter Jane's life resembles any teenager; confused, angst, unclear, while her friend Angela, loaded with self esteem dreams of being a model. Carolyn holds her facade of perfection, while her real estate job become more painful with every depressingly negative customer. Moving in next door, Ricky wanders on the edge of the social scene. His father Frank is emotionally repressed, never making conversation longer than a few sentences with Ricky. All of them have been stuck with their lives, yet while they break free from their dead ends, freedom has its price.<br/><br/>American Beauty is one of the most beautiful movies ever to grace the history of film. The notion of suburbia's dark side; behind the white picket fence is a world of secrets, has been explored by many, though Sam Mendez has created such a deep and rich pathos of the characters; freedom and individualism, sex and desire, anxiety and change. Alan Ball's script is darkly witty, grabbing us from the get go. The humor slowly morphs, as the emotional tensity builds upon itself, buildings to its heart breaking crescendo.<br/><br/>Sam Mendez's direction is beautifully enhanced by Conrad L. Hall's cinematography. The widescreen perfectly shows the irony of the world the characters live in. Rooms of the houses have symmetrical design, while the furnishings balance out each other; when the dilemma's of the characters are anything but balanced. The rich pastel colour palette is so vibrant. Thomas Newman's amazing score harmoniously works to the story, increasing the tension of every scene.<br/><br/>In his Oscar winning role, Kevin Spacey is amazing. Embodying a man who has hit bottom, fitting his way out to his ideals, Spacey is just mesmerising. Annette Bening is also wonderful, bring the her best role of her career. Thora Birch brought so much beauty to Jane, matched wonderfully by Mena Suvari. Chris Cooper emotionally withdrawn role of Frank is amazing. Wes Bentley injected so much mystery and awe to Ricky, creating such an enigma of a character.<br/><br/>For a comedy that makes you cry, and a drama that makes you laugh, American Beauty is one powerful film, becoming an instant classic."

There are moments in the film where the laughter is genuine, where the intense drama is almost unbearable, where dreamlike visions spark to life with such magic, we almost can't believe what we are seeing, and where tears flow freely with heartfelt understanding and identification with the characters. . And that brilliant color red--in scene after scene--we can almost smell those roses and recoil at the blood. The great film makers that filmed dream sequences--whether it is Fellini or Bergman or Hitchcock--are joined now by Sam Mendes. There are images and scenes and details in this movie destined for classical status: Angela in the bath of roses (what an image!), Ricky's beautiful heartbreaking film of the flying bag, the extraordinary use of music--whether the pop music from Lester's youth or the gorgeous, haunting Newman score which compliments the scenes so perfectly, Lester's scenes at work (who doesn't fantasize about speaking up the way he does?), the gorgeous, gorgeous meditation on the simple, beautiful images of his life passing before his eyes (bringing to mind Wilder's ""Our Town"" soliloquy that Emily gives detailing the simple, tender, but oh-so-meaningful moments in life, that make life worth living), the emotional roller-coaster, and off-kilter experience the viewer has as Angela and Lester's final scene goes from genuine eroticism, to tenderness, to wistfulness, to wise and profound understanding. On so many levels this film is one of the great cinematic experiences--as a work of art it can be studied and seen over and over again for myriad details, and as a work of the heart--it can be cherished."

","This film is AMAZING! For Sam Mendes' first film it is truly mind-blowing. Kevin Spacey is wonderfully cast as a man bored with his life, who has the mid-life crisis of a life-time. It has everything a mid-life crisis should have; a new 'va va voom' car, a hot, younger chick and muscles! Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey)has become my dad's own personal hero. However, this film is not just mindless entertainment. The plot takes an interesting turn as Lester starts to realise the importance of life and his family. The entire story is beautifully entwined to produce a result where any of the characters could end up being Lester's murderer.<br/><br/>With Conrad L. Hall's beautifully done cinematography, this film has been created with a huge conscience. The way that the camera pans left as Lester is killed, shows us that the violence is not the subject of the film. It is focused more upon what Lester learns in the last moments leading up to his death.<br/><br/>The music also adds to the superb creativity in this film. In what was potentially a cheesy moment, where Jane and Ricky are sat watching a homemade movie of a plastic bag flying in the air, Thomas Newman added the crucially subtle music that makes this moment meaningful instead.<br/><br/>There are too many wonderful things to say about this film now though, so i'll leave you with this one last comment: Watch this film if it's the last thing you do, because you will never see another film quite like it."
"eagle0468","8","1","2","9 August 2005"," Dark Optimism
","Although the character development of this film was thin, it was able to present the main theme well. A man has seemed to lose all hope. He has no respect from his family nor his boss at work. That is until he meets the neighbors son and begins a journey of chaotic optimism.<br/><br/>Scene after scene is this movie is well produced, filmed and directed. Nevertheless, you still seem to feel you are just touching the surface of this story. This is a thematic element that is both engrossing yet frustrating at the same time. Certain characters do things that are seemingly unpredictable and a bit unrealistic as well.<br/><br/>I still think the story was well written and the central theme was effectively presented. The ending is quite a shocker even though it was foreshadowed early on. Not the letdown I expected. Foreshadowing an ending can be dangerous for film as the ""punchline"" may be too easily expected. Yet this ending will leave you gape mouthed and in a state of shock.<br/><br/>A very well done movie with one small flaw with the character development. Great entertainment."

","One of the best movies I have seen. First, kudos to Allen Ball for the script because the writing makes the whole thing possible. The direction by Sam Mendes is also a superb effort and for a first-film he has to thank his lucky stars to have a storyline and cast such as this to work with. This is a story of two people 20 years into a relationship and where their lives are and who they are, compared to what they thought life would turn out to be for them being young and idealistic and not knowing what age, maturity and responsibility would do to alter who they are (or thought they were). Did anyone notice that Angela is the incarnation of the young Carolyn? Smoking pot, speaking freely about sex and just generally enjoying life and all the while trying to convince herself that she is not whom she really is? I believe this is why Lester has such an attraction to her, it is his wife 20 years ago. Lester rediscovered himself, Carolyn refuses to do so. It is so sad to finally discover that material things and projecting a false image becomes more appealing to a person than being brave enough to live life for what it really is. You want a husband? It is a lifetime commitment. COMMITMENT. You want a family? Again, a lifetime commitment. LIFETIME. Carolyn is more concerned with her own self respect and the image she portrays to the rest of the world than enjoying what she already has. Ricky, at age 18 has already learned this. She along with Col. Fits are living sad and lonely lives based on lies they choose to live. Is it so scary to be an individual? Is it so wrong to be who you are? I don't want to go over 1,000 words so I'll leave with this - the hardest thing to do is to look at yourself in the mirror and be proud of what you see. Or is that the easiest? ..."

","American beauty is my all time favorite movie. The movie takes its stand on issues that society faces everyday but will not accept that it does face them. Angela, Lester, Carolyn, Jane and Ricky are real characters. The movie actually goes pretty smoothly and takes you along. I was left thinking ""huh!"" when it ended. Its little sad towards the end but thats how American family life is the way it is seen and perceived in general. I particularly enjoyed the conversations between Lester and Carolyn. I liked the role of Lester so much; a true hero, especially when she makes Angela say that she is feeling so stupid! No wonder this movie won 5 Oscars. <br/><br/>-Vishy"

","American beauty has so many things you can think over, when I first saw the advertisement for it I thought , of course it's one of those movies romantic drama with no drama in it, but once i sat and watched the movie i suddenly realized that the credit and the awards that it got was not for nothing. Lester character tells us how much a person can change in his life maybe it was some how delinquent but great Kevin spacey really earned his Oscar as will as SAM Mendez. American beauty is not about sex and it's not about lester committing adultery with Angela ,It's much more than that it's about changing our vision and our look to life in general and as lester said ""I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life"".<br/><br/>American beauty is the best piece of work I've ever seen and for those who didn't watch the movie I'm telling you are missing a lot and for the who didn't like It sorry It's not that you didn't like It, you didn't understand it once you watch what's beyond you will love this movie."

","This movie was often showed in the local TV, but somehow I always missed it. And what did I miss! <br/><br/>American Beauty contains some really outstanding performances, I especially liked Annette Bening's (how couldn't she win an Academy Award for THIS?), but I can tell there's no single weak link in the entire cast.<br/><br/>Maybe the topic of the film is not really new, but with the cleverly written dialogs and well-built scenes, the things I'm thinking about every day comes through more effectively. There are too many hypocrites and too few people who have to courage to act like how they really are, to live like how they really want to. But the film has an uplifting message as well, it also shows how can you find beauty in every little thing, just try it and you will see! This film agitates me and calms me down at the same time, The Hours is the only other movie which took this kind of effect on me.<br/><br/>Another notable thing is the film score, I often catch myself singing 'Don't rain on my parade'.<br/><br/>I recommend it with all my heart to everyone who likes philosophizing on movies, and wants to see something...well, beautiful."
"dav07dan02","9","1","2","6 July 2005"," what are we all searching for in life?
","Director: Sam Mendes, Script: Alan Ball, Cast: Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Meni Suvari, Chris Cooper, Peter Gallahger.<br/><br/>Very good comedy drama by Menses and Ball. This film makes one think about what's really important in life. The Burnham family in this movie have a fancy house in a nice suburban neighbourhood with lots of materialistic things, yet none of them are happy. They are all searching for something that they cannot obtain. They have taken life and each other for granted, something all of us Americans do. This movie is really a character study on the members of the Burnham family:Lester (Keven Spacey), Carolyn (Annette Bening), and Jane (Thora Birch).<br/><br/>Ricky Fits (Wes Bently), the new neighbour boy next door is the one character in this film who sees happiness within himself in spite of the problems around him. I think this is because he is able to see beauty in things that other people see as ordinary and he is able to enjoy the simple things in life. He comes across as being weird to other people but Jane becomes intrigued by him and the way he sees things. Carolyn is searching for happiness not from her family but through her career. And Lester,who much of this movie centres around, is going through a middle age crisis. He longs for the lifestyle he had when he was younger and happier. He is tired of the way he is being treated by his boss, he wife, his daughter. Two people in this film will have a profound effect on him: Ricky and Angela (Meni Suvari), Jane's high school friend. As the story starts to unfold and we learn more about the characters, we come to realize that people are not always who they seen to be. Meaning that once you really get to know someone, their is a lot more to them than what we saw superficially before we really knew them. For example, through most of the film Angela came across as being a self-centred, narcissistic little witch but as we got to know her toward the end of the film, she is actually very nice. She was just acting that way to hide insecurities within herself. This film has a downbeat ending but it is to be expected.<br/><br/>This is a film that will stir up many emotions. All the characters are very well developed. With repeated viewings one can get something new out of this film. This film is a contemporary classic."

","Am I wrong when I say that American Beauty is a representation of America as a country through the use of an average household? Every leading character carries a different aspect of the different communities and also politically and culturally. The acting is absolutely superb and Sam Mendes really made a mark. Since I am a young film directing student I am still learning a lot from directors like Sam, therefore this movie really created a footstool for potential new movies and also shows America where their 'Dream' went wrong. That is entirely my point of view and I may be entirely wrong. All I want to do is make people think about the reason for the film. The biggest lesson I got out of the movie is that there is beauty in everything - even dead birds! It grabs the audience in such a fashion that - when I saw it for the first time, I was interrupted by fourth-years who wanted to see it and I felt like killing them because of the fact that they broke the atmosphere. That is all I have to say and there is no more...ff"

","I thought this was going to be another exploitation of the older man/little girl fantasy like LOLITA or something. Wrong! This movie shows people and American suburbia at its worst, but also highlights some of the best through the eyes of one of the most unlikely character. There are no saints in this movie--one of the goals seems to be to break down unreal impressions/images we hold. W SEMI-spoiler ahead When one of these unreal visions comes to pieces it makes a pivotal moment for a lead character, but unfortunately too late--as a result of another character's inability to see the truth.<br/><br/>Not a happy film, but was still inspiring at the same time."

","The plot to 'Beauty' seems simple. Lester (Spacey) is bored with his life. His once solid marriage is now a complete charade. His teenage daughter despises him. And he's on the verge of losing his job. On the outside, his life seems like the perfect snapshot of an American family. But we learn quickly that Lester and everyone around him is far from happy. He goes through life in a daze, trying hard to care, and failing miserably.<br/><br/>However he is wrenched out of sedation when his daughter brings home her free-spirited best friend, Angela. Suddenly Lester's life is filled with new purpose, and he goes about trying to correct his life and reclaim the joyous and carefree ways of his youth. Along the way all those around him also embark of journeys of self discovery. However it doesn't take long for Lester to realize the beauty of the life he has now. This may sound like a typical self-actualization movie, but it is far from it. <br/><br/>American Beauty is, simply put, a phenomenal film. It's a family drama, a black comedy, a love story, and a mystery, all at the same time. it dares you to categorize it. It's impossible. Moments of side-splitting laughter are juxaposed with moments of despair so sad they are almost painful to watch. The script is an exercise in restraint, and each line seems carefully selected. You learn more about each character with a look than most movies can explain in their entirety. <br/><br/>The acting is also superb. From Lester himself, to the three roles played by teens, each one seems as real as your next-door neighbor. They are full fleshed out people. Even small roles seem as if they could walk right out of your television. You'll find pieces of yourself in each one. <br/><br/>This is a movie that can change your life. If you haven't seen it, open your mind and take a look, because this is a film that will touch your heart, soul, and mind. If you let it."

","I thought this movie did a great job of showing how weird people can appear to be when viewed from afar. I also thought it did a good job of portraying the chaos that can ensue in what appears to be a cookie cutter perfect suburban family. Kevin Spacey also did a great job playing his role. I enjoyed watching him try and work his way back into the driver's seat of his life. I also thought that the neighbor boy with his strange obsession with his camera was a well-added element. It produced this creepy kind of feel, but at the same time he helped us see our own worlds in a new light. All of these elements combined to create one great movie that can be life shattering to some. I recommend this movie to anyone."

The daughter is seeing the next door neighbor who is into dealing drugs. Finally Mr. Burnham is into the drugs, which eventually leads to him getting shot at the end.

I don't think it would have been as good if they had chosen someone else to play Lester. This movie changed the outlook I had on life a little. The film was filled with many great shots.

","Director Sam Mendes proves a great showman, but his film fails when it tries to pass itself off as some deep philosophical commentary on suburban life. Since the movie makes most of its points as a cartoon, it's a bit much when it asks us to buy its adult characters as human beings (this makes the film's motto, 'look closer' ironic, since it doesn't bear close scrutiny).<br/><br/>I'd pin the blame for this fatal flaw on Alan Ball, whose screenplay, despite capturing many truthful moments, hobbles everyone involved by being more interested in hollow sensationalism than real emotions (the ending being a good example).<br/><br/>Still, the movie excels as a beautifully shot, very entertaining black comedy."
"tjvangogh","10","1","2","16 March 2005"," Perhaps the best film ever made.
","The movie, American Beauty, investigates the American cultures need to fulfill external measures of success, happiness, and beauty. It focuses on Lester Burnham, a loser who is in a mid-life crisis. An infatuation with his teenage daughter's friend, Angela, ignites a stream of rebellious acts meant to liberate him from the yoke of his marriage and job. Similar revelations are happening to the supporting cast as each struggle to meet some external vision of happiness or perfection. Wife, Carol, seeks to be the best real estate agent, best gardener, best everything. Daughter, Jane, seeks a breast augmentation and Angela, masks her own insecurities in a blanket of sexual bravado. Lester's mid-life crisis, in combination with the new neighbors next door, rattles the status quo, questioning the meaning of happiness  true acceptance.<br/><br/>The movie's strength is in the director's artistry to repeat the thematic meaning in every aspect of the film  setting, wardrobe, dialogue, background music, and camera angles to name a few. Every frame is artfully arranged to articulate the core meaning of the film.<br/><br/>In the opening scene Lester introduces, ""This is my neighborhood ... This is my life,"" and the first of three overhead pans bring us into this model suburbia. The plot is a combination of familiar and absurd that combined relate and challenge us. The shocking opening scene of Lester masturbating, while offensive, assures us that there will be no secrets between Lester and the audience.<br/><br/>Our introduction to Carol makes her obsessive, up-tight personality evident in dialogue, setting and wardrobe. Carol's roses, and numerous other versions will be a metaphor for beauty (rigid perfection of the bloom), or lust (petals) and/or power in the vibrant reds. The relationship between the family members is mirrored in the morning ritual of driving to work. Carol (posture erect) drives and Jane sits front/passenger, while Lester curls up, fetal position, in the back. The body language, and character placement describes the position, status, and emotional relationship of the family members.<br/><br/>In various scenes that follow, mood is reflected in the setting. The redundant, gray/blue hum of Lester's office, and Angela's bedroom wall papered with fashion images, all reveal volumes about the characters. Carol chants, ""I will sell a house today"" and then is alone with her breakdown. Every character is isolated, detached, and hopelessly unhappy.<br/><br/>Lester's fantasy sequences offer the greatest contrast in setting. Every sequence is accompanied by slews of rose petals, otherworld music, and mists.<br/><br/>The director uses the lens of different cameras to force the audience into seeing relationships and personalities ""anew"". The most obvious of lenses is that of Rickie's camcorder. It is a voyeur into the lives of the Burnham family, especially that of Jane, the object of his affection. How are these viewpoints different than the camera of the director? Setting reveals the characters. The stark bedroom, lined with video tapes reek of isolation, and secrecy. His parent's home is meticulously clean, devoid of sentimentality. They are as empty and isolated as the rest. The musical choices float in the background or explode in the foreground are equally revealing of the character's attitudes like the melodic ""Bali Hai"" or the rocking ""American Woman"".<br/><br/>The dialogue is equally revealing -- meant to be interpreted in contradiction of their delivery or to foreshadow events. Angela's line, ""Everything that's meant to happen, does, eventually,"" is both the babbling teenager and a prophecy. Angela is unaware of how revealing her statement, ""I'm so sick of people taking their insecurities out on me,"" is in relation to her own insecurities.<br/><br/>Stage two begins with the opening street pan and he narrates. ""It's a great thing when you can surprise yourself. It makes you wonder what else you can do"". It sets the tone for part two  there will be great surprises by Lester, and all the characters. Carol's surprise is part adultery and part ammunition. It is revealing that after her rendezvous with the Real Estate King (""Yes your majesty"") that we see Carol in the first soft look of the film  a pale rose patterned sweater at dinner. In each subsequent scene she wears power red. The gray is gone. Jane surprises everyone when she walks home with Ricky, and later undresses for him in the window. Lester. Of course, is still in pursuit of Angela and thinks a good workout might substantiate his fantasy. He is direct when asked his motivation for working out and he says, ""I want to look good naked."" The honesty with which he states his intent implies a new self-honesty, but later events will reveal how deceived Lester really was.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most powerful dialogue is the line ""In order to be successful, it's important to project an image of success."" The line, in part, defines the question of the movie. What is success? What is beauty? Who defines it? Does success or beauty constitute happiness? If you're only projecting it, than by definition, you aren't really successful, are you? Ricky's bag video is both cryptic and metaphorical. Understanding the meaning behind the video gives us the best glimpse of real happiness, real self-acceptance. What is it that is hiding? Does Ricky discover that the masks, and anxieties, and the projections, we hide behind interfere with beauty? Is beauty physical or material? I think Ricky knows the truth and it's reflected in the translucent bag; the ordinary. When the movie's over do we know the truth? More importantly, do we believe it, or do we quickly slip back behind? The final stage of the story is again introduced by the overhead pan of Lester's street. All the anxieties will come to a crescendo in these final scenes. How it all comes down (the rain) is clever and surprising due to a well sequenced plot, but what it all means is still left to metaphorical sequences, and the discerning eye of Ricky, our resident director. He gets to look behind."

"rich-475","10","1","2","7 March 2005"," Joyces ""Ulysses"" re-imagined in contemporary America
","I've read several of the reviews of ""American Beauty"" on this website and I am surprised that no one has noticed that this was an adaptation of Joyce's ""Ulysses"" and to a lesser extent his ""Portait of an Artist as A Young Man"". Lester Burnham and Leopold Bloom have the same initials, both sell advertising, and both engage in famous masturbation scenes fantasizing over much younger women (Gertie McDowell and Angela Hayes). And they both have wives (Molly Bloom and Carolyn Burnham) who cuckold them with men they know professionally, and in the end both are in love with their husbands. I thought that the scene in which Carolyn Burnham grabs her husbands clothes in the closet after she learns of his death and seems to inhale his presence was very poignant. Maybe not as iconic as Molly's ""yes she said yes I will yes.."" but extremely well acted by Annette Bening.<br/><br/>There is also the obvious reworking of the theme of the young artists (Stephen Dedalus and Ricky Fits) rejecting their paternal fathers (John Dedalus and Frank Fits)and forging sympathetic relationships with other, older male role models. I also sensed an echoing of Stephens recently dead mother in the portrayal of Franks wraith like mother in the film. In the end both young artists end up fleeing the confining strictures of place and family to pursue their art and their lives.<br/><br/>I was intrigued by the many comments in the review about Frank's video of the blue garbage bag blowing about in the wind. When Joyce wrote ""Ulysses"" many critics thought that looking for aesthetic values in a novel about the lives of lower, middle-class Dubliners was pointless. They were just to Catholic, to Irish and to ordinary to be of any artistic significance. I felt that the wind blown garbage bag captured the essence of Joyces affection for the seemingly common place beauty that surrounds us if we take the time to look.<br/><br/>I though ""American Beauty"" was an excellent movie. To take a story that has been told and reinterpreted for over 2,500 years, to extract from it the timelessness of its humanity and to re-imagine it in a contemporary setting is great art. And Kevin Spacey absolutely aced the part."

","A beautiful piece of work by first time director Sam Mendes. Easily one of the most accomplished film debuts in the history of cinema. The story centers around a man named Lester Burnham (the wonderful Oscar winning Kevin Spacey) a man who has lost passion in his life. His wife Caroline (Annette Benning in an equally stunning performance) is a workaholic real estate agent. Both are frustrated with their marriage which is basically just for show. Sexually frustrated Lest lusts for one of his daughter's (Thora Birch) girlfriends,Anglea (Menna Suvari). This lust begins Lester's search for happiness in life, so he quits his job and begins to flip burgers just like when he was a kid. Caroline is very frustrated with the fact that she has to be the breadwinner of the family and has an affair. Meanwhile the boy next door,Ricky is videotaping the Burnhams the daughter Jane in particular. The two strike a chord with each other and begin a romantic relationship. Ricky's father, Frank is a homophobe who suspect Ricky is homosexual because he is spending some time with Lester, of course this is not true. All Ricky is doing is scoring Lester some drugs. As the story progresses Lester gets used to Angela, and Angela starts to warm up to Lester. <br/><br/>This film is a must see for anyone who appreciates film!"

","Of course these are great words but American Beauty remains the best film I've ever seen. Lester Burnham (played by the fabulous Kevin Spacey, who was awarded with one of the most deserved Oscars ever for the role) tells us that he will be dead in a year - and IS already. That's the simple but genuine idea of the film and what director Sam Mendes (you really can see that he was a theatre director before!) and scriptwriter Alan Ball present between these words and Lester's death is an amazing drama with a beautiful poetic story, dark humour (which makes you laugh even after the twentieth time of watching), breathtaking pictures (especially the ones by Ricky's handy cam!) and an ensemble of actors that has never been beaten up to now. Lester decides to change his boring and frustrating life completely. He falls in love with his daughter's girlfriend Angela (Mena Suvari - yes, she CAN play serious roles!) and masturbates at night (while his wife Carolyn is lying next to him!) This ""new"" feeling of sexual satisfaction takes Lester to give up his job and blackmail an enormous compensation by the fierce Brad. (Perhaps one the funniest scenes of the film - just these words: ""Against who?"" - ""Against you!"") He meets the new neighbour Ricky Fits and smokes dope again, just as in his earlier (and better!) days. Ricky (played by the overwhelming Wes Bentley, who is just as good or even better than Spacey!), who seems to have some mental problems in the beginning but seems to be the most intelligent character of the story, falls in love with Lester's daughter Jane (Thora Birch - excellently rebellious!) and protests against his brutal and radically conservative father Colonel Frank Fits (Chris Cooper - better than in ""Adaption""!). Carolyn (Annette Bening, in my opinion a little bit outmatched by the amazing acting of Spacey and Bentley), Lester's ""offical"" wife, tries to compensate her lack in life with an affair to the successful estate agent Buddy Kane but isn't able to find a way out of her crisis either. I don't want to talk too much about the plot because it is too complex for a review. It would also be unfair for all the poor film-lovers which couldn't see this masterpiece yet. Only that much: The film continues with a lot of guns, a plastic bag ""playing"" in the wind (the most poetic scene in film history!) and a very surprising appearance of homosexuality. In the end I can just say, Thank you Sam Mendes, Thank you Alan Ball, Thank you Kevin Spacey and all the others! THANK YOU FOR THIS FILM!!!"

Kevin spacey is terrific in his role as Lester and the scene when he is ""fired"" is memorable. The sense of humor continuous with a mix of tragedy with Captain Fits and his weird family.

There has been excellent casting done for this movie and the way they show the story is really amazing too. For example, the dream about Angela in the beginning of the movie where she is on the ceiling of the bedroom,I think is just amazing. With the falling rose-leaves. It's so wonderfully done. The movie is filled with moments like this. The way the characters evolve throughout the movie is excellent too. The way Kevin Spacey's character evolves through the movie until the ending of his life. The only thing i can say about it, is that it's a pleasure to watch.

"Gideon_Mack","10","1","2","6 August 2004"," A Cinematic Masterpiece.
","American Beauty is the perfect tragicomedy which shows us an insight into a seemingly perfect family living in America. Kevin Spacey is excellently cast as Lester Burnham and the others are also well cast and Spacey's dry humour gives the film some great lines (such as the one in the shower scene). This film features many things from closet homosexuality to Nazism, and from mid-life crisis' to adultery. Sam Mendes shows us that he can make a great film with great cinematography and a great score from Thomas Newman. My favourite film - 10/10."

","Given that this was a ""it'll have to do"" DVD rental choice, I wasn't prepared for the mesmerising effect this film had on me. What also surprised me was the wide range of views that others took from it, some negative including: warnings about drugs, dropping out, the depressing nature of a wasted life, alienation, family breakdown, etc.<br/><br/>These (and many other views) remain so, but for me, the overarching message is one of waking up to the drama and indescribable beauty of every day life (and in fact, every moment). The whole film seems summed up by the paradox of Ricky's plastic bag, dancing in the wind: ordinary, forgettable, banal... yet aching with beauty. 'Look closer' says the strap line. Astounding."
"misterbaker2006","10","1","2","23 July 2004"," the TRUTH be told: this film really is BEAUTIFUL!
","What is so appealing about American Beauty is not only the fact that everything in the film is actually beautiful, but also that the film is so truthful. The movie takes us through the suburban lives of an ""average"" American family; and nothing in this film is sugar-coated. The excellent writing displays such honesty, that it's hard not to laugh at situations that any American family could find themselves in. And it's even harder to not be touched by this family's journey through every day life. The story is told -through narration- by a middle-aged man named Lester, who seems to be going through a not so typical mid-life crisis. His wife, Carolyn, and daughter, Jane, begin to change as well. Lester hates his job, is neglected by his family, and seems to be utterly unhappy, until one day he finds an outlet for his frustrations: a teenaged girl. Carolyn seems to never find any self-satisfaction and is constantly hard on herself for not being the perfect real estate agent; and then she finds lust with the 'King of Real Estate' (her biggest competitor) . And Jane is living in the shadow of her best and most flamboyant friend, Angela; until she finds her new and mysterious neighbor constantly videotaping her because he's just 'curious.' Lester's biggest transformation begins when he meets Angela for the first time. He is instantly fascinated with her, and we find this out through multiple fantasy sequences- which all share the same beautifully original symbolic element which can only be described in Lester's words: 'Spectacular.' We're not sure what it is, but we know that Lester's fantasies are not of perversion, but of some kind of yearning for love, acceptance, beauty, or anything in between. And these fantasy sequences are not the only beautiful thing in the movie. In fact, while Lester searches for happiness, we see that everything is beautiful. And I'm not just referring to the video tapings of Jane's new found neighbor, but of literally everything. Now, I won't give away the details, but every scene is filmed so perfectly that everything from a rose petal to even the saddest, most grotesque visions of death, are beautiful. That is the beauty of American Beauty. Everything can be, and is beautiful. However, that is only the underlying cleverness of the writing. The true beauty is found in Lester; a man whose life experiences are so sad, funny, touching, and confusing, that for some reason, in the end of the film everything seems to make sense. Definitely the best film of 1999, and sure to be an instant classic, American Beauty earns it's much deserved perfect rating of 10 STARS from me."

It serves as a dark reminder that the suburbs are not as they appear.<br/><br/>:SPOILER ALERT:<br/><br/>I have many favorite scenes of this movie such as the ""Spartanette"" scene where Lester first fancies Angela, the famous ""Plastic Bag"" scene, the scene where Ricky and his Dad quarrel right before Ricky decides to leave, and the scene where Frank kisses Lester in the rain. This is a powerful film that appropriately received the Best Picture Oscar.<br/><br/>:SPOILER END:<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is stellar of course. Kevin Spacey totally became Lester Burnham and injected life into the character. Annette Bening was awesome as Caroline and should have received the Best Actress Oscar. Thora Birch played the tormented Jane Burnham to a T, Mena Suvari was great as the deceptively seductive Angela, Chris Cooper was excellent as the Colonel Frank Fits, and everyone else was wonderful as well.<br/><br/>The direction, the script, the cinematography, and the score were excellent as well. It's too bad Thomas Newman didn't win the Oscar for Best Score because his music underlined the context of this movie perfectly. Hopefully, he'll get the Academy Award he deserves one day.<br/><br/>The only quibble I had with this film was the script was bordering on pretentious a few times. Other than that, it's a superb movie that will hopefully be remembered as a classic one day.<br/><br/>10/10"

","The film, American Beauty, directed by Sam Mendes, tells the tale of the ideal American family, well at least on the outside. Living in suburbia, with a white picket fence, two cars in the garage, two parents in the home, a teenage daughter, friendly neighbors, the only thing that seems to be missing is a dog named Spot. But there is a whole lot more going on then what appears on the surface. This nuclear family is really based on false images. On the exterior Carolyn is the perfect mother however her character is dealing with an unhappy marriage, disappointment as a mother, and failure as a successful real estate agent.  Her husband, Lester, has become indifferent to everything in his life.  His loss of drive in life is transformed when he decides to make changes in his life. Jane, the daughter, is also miserable due to her absorption of society's concept of what is beautiful. Unsupported by her parents, she finally finds acceptance and the feeling of love from her new neighbor. There are a plethora of other characters in the film, including Ricky, his parents, and Angela. Angela, Jane's alleged best friend, symbolizes society's image of beauty. She fits all the stereotypes set by America's media, blond hair, blue eyes, thin, and sexually active. Jane's new neighbor, Ricky acts as a stimulus in the film. His vision of beauty counteracts to the predetermined notion of what image beauty which is accepted by society. The film unites the dramatic with dark comedy. It depicts the false assumptions that everything is ideal when you are at a certain economic level, and a part of white America. Unhappiness is not biased to race or economic status, and artificial exteriors are often misleading. The film is entertaining and enticing to the audience, yet also reveals how characters handle Berger's concept of surveyor and surveyed. Each character feels the pressures of being viewed a certain way by society, internalizes it and changes their behavior accordingly. Angela lies about her sexual experience, Jane is saving money for a boob job (which she obviously does not need), Carolyn makes everyone think she has everything together, Lester continued to work in an unsatisfying job, and Ricky hides how he really makes his money from his parents. All these acts are the character's response to knowing they are being surveyed, watched, by society. The underlying theme in the movie is what a sham it is to have one idea of what beauty is. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder."
"numeron","Null","1","2","21 April 2004"," It is movie to exist forever
","American Beauty is great for me because I watched it once on Rusian TV, about month ago and I still addicted to it. I read a plot and bios of Sam Mendes and Kevin Spacey, a story how this movie were produced. And I realized that Sam Mendes from a good screenplay, small moneys, careful actors has made an outstanding movie. The plot was more crude and ordinary than what it became after cutting.  There were a story with the end known from the start, with an American court and people said something about 'you know, I will die sooner'. There was an obvious homosexuality of Colonel. In movie it is a surprise for an audience and confirmation of the deepest suspicions of the most devoted movie watchers. Kevin Spacey always played miserable worms without any shadow of attraction. He starts the same but in a few minutes we see him charming, sexual and benevolent. He collides with daughter, wife, employer only because he understands that he has misplaced his desires and does not live but survives. His family exists to show the success of his wife. Everyone around is a lier and everybody cripples lives of their dearest. Colonel Fitz treats his son extremely cruel to make him 'a real man'. Father is a latent gay and son suffers from his brutal cruelty and coldness. Ricky (a son) so used to hide his essence that real life has become a film for him and he finds himself in videotapes which he makes. Lester (Spacey)'s wife Caroline is the poorest woman in the world. None loves her and she even does not need it. Her lover is more business idol than a close friend. She lives for shopping of attributes of success. She and Lester see their daughter every day and know nothing about her. Lester tries to be free and happy. He does only really important things. He falls in love. He does not understand that he upsets the ideas of wife and daughter how he should behave that they want to kill him at least in their thoughts. He could be killed by anyone and at the end it is not really important that he is killed by Colonel who fools himself suspecting a gay in his son. The biggest hint in this movie for me that Lester sees in dreams his love (young girl) around roses which his wife cultivates but he does not realize it."

The film also lacked Arnold Schwarzenegger, who must truly be the hottest actor and therefore best actor in tinseltown. Spacey just swanned around looking neurotic.<br/><br/>The cinematography and colour placement was awful and derivative. Why did they have those red roses all over the place? They had no relation to the story. If they needed cheap props, they should have lined the house with Frankfurter sausages.<br/><br/>The most annoying thing about this film is that it opens with the line, ""My name is Lester Banks."" Duh! I read that on the back of the video. How stupid can you be? The back of the video said this was a ""cutting picture"", but no one got cut in it!

"roninmlb","4","1","2","19 December 2003"," The word ""overrated"" was created for this pile of trash
","I had big expectations for this film because of all the Oscars and hype, and when I finally saw it, man, did it dissapoint. From point A to Z this film is a failure. From the hideous wannabe hip dialogue to the use of every 90's cliche in existence. Oh, in the 90's EVERY high school kid smokes pot. In the 90's, EVERY gay couple are inherently the nicest people on the block. In the 90's, every suburbian family are hiding dark secrets behind the facade of normality. I could continue but I won't. Hmm, didn't we see that in ""Happiness"" and other films? We don't need another forcefull presentation of this messege.<br/><br/>I just loved how the character Ricky was such a 90's reinessance man (not to mention nearly the exact same character as Jude Law's in Mendes' follow crap ""Road to Perdition"")! Not only a high school student and deep philosopher who appreciates the beauty in grocery bags, he also has time to be an amatuer videographer, caterer, successful drug dealer with a long list of clients, voyuer, and an ex-mental patient. Darn, kids in the 90's sure know how to multitask! What a charming lad! GAG!<br/><br/>Now, on to the performances. While Kevin Spacey was mostly believable throughout, not a single other actor was. Particularly embarrassing was Annette Bening's spaztic, inapropriately overdramatic and totally unbelievable performance. Even the normally brilliant Chris Cooper failed to deliver the goods in his most dramatic scenes. And don't get me started on the teenage actors, who further rob the already DOA dialogue of any shred of credibility or sincerity.<br/><br/>Dramaticly, it was boring and devoid of life. No character ever has any realistic motivation to do anything interesting. The extended and stupid fantasy scenes were meaningless and far too numerous. Oh, and just by chance, Chris Cooper and Annette were planning to kill Kevin with the exact same brand of gun.<br/><br/>What makes it all the worse are the special features on the DVD in which the producers talk about how this was the best screenplay they'd ever read and crap like that. How could they be so dumb? Are they illiterate? The dialogue was just HIDEOUS! How could this crap get so much critical praise? It's baffling, seriously. It's just representive of how artisticly vacant modern Hollywood is. Want further proof? The very next year, ""Gladiator"" wins best picture."
"Canino-4","3","1","2","16 December 2003"," Watch it Fade
","It's nice to see this overrated film fade from the memory, alongside other Oscar ""winners"", like the silly Thelma and Louise or Sitcom-ish As Good as it Gets. Make no mistake that Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening and Chris Cooper can bring the goods, but this slice of baby-boomer angst is hardly their shining hour. I can also express no surprise, whatsoever, as Mena Suvari is now appearing in one of the endless parade of Cheerleader/Dance films. Critics had her sized-up as the next Susan Sarandon. I had my doubts when I first saw this, that maybe, just maybe I was wrong. Maybe the two gay guys bringing by the fruit-basket/housewarming present had some esoteric,deeper meaning, and wasn't really fit for a Jim Belushi sitcom. Maybe the fact that Chris Cooper paid such maniacal attention to his son (Wes Bentley) it was predatory, and then failed to observe him making thousands, damn near millions, selling the cool-sounding ""Thai Stick"", maybe, just maybe, that, in and of itself had some deeper meaning. I thought maybe Peter Gallagher's bad acting was also part of the spice of the movie. Maybe Annette Bening hitting the target range wasn't really a cliche, but a sly poke at inferior movies that do such stuff. Maybe Kevin Spacey's ""Can we take you to the pizza-joint, huh, huh, huh, huh?????"", maybe that's supposed to be high humor, too. I think of these things, and say... Naahhh. This movie just over-rated. Has my anger about the ridiculous snub of Russell Crowe for The Insider, and that film's complete shut-out surfaced yet? Just checking. All I can say is, fade away, American Beauty, fade away."
"jdberkley","5","1","2","22 October 2003"," I must agree with those who believe this film is badly overrated(MAJOR SPOILERS TO FOLLOW)...
","In fact, while it is well-acted, it isn't at all a successful film in my opinion, because it bails out on a storyline it doesn't have the guts to follow through on. Let me explain this in detail, because I want to be clear about this-- the people who made this film are exceptional artists(especially its late, great cinematographer Conrad L. Hall), and they're certainly not careless people. But in this case, I think they blew it.<br/><br/>The very first scene of this film shows a videotape recording of a girl being asked by her boyfriend if she would like him to kill her father. She replies, ""Yes. Would you?"" Now, why is this scene there? It is repeated and shown in its full context later, in which the boy later says, somewhat unconvincingly, that he was kidding. But in showing this scene twice, the movie creates a very real expectation in any viewer who is reasonably well-versed in the mechanics of the mystery genre. <br/><br/>That's what ""American Beauty"" is, ultimately-- it is the story of a murder, and of a murder victim. You can tell a murder story in many ways, but usually they're just variations of the following two plotlines. You can either make the story about finding out who the killer is, or you can make the killer known early, and make the story about hunting that person down. ""American Beauty"" sets up the expectation, by repeating that scene, that Lester Burnham, who tells us in the first scene he'll be dead by the end of the movie, will be murdered, and that these two kids will kill him. Part of the intrigue of watching ""American Beauty"" after the repeated scene is in learning how much you like both Lester Burnham and his daughter and her boyfriend, and in hoping against hope that the result the movie has promised won't happen. But then, it doesn't. The movie bails out, and pins the crime on the one wholly unsympathetic character in the movie, a character that has little or no dimension until the end and no real motivation to commit the crime he does. <br/><br/>""American Beauty"" cheats the audience out of the family tragedy it promised from the very first frame, in order to give us an easy villain to hiss. How am I so certain ""American Beauty"" went wrong? In an interview with ""Creative Screenwriter"" magazine, screenwriter Alan Ball said that in his original draft, the kids committed the murder, but in the aftermath of several killing sprees by American teenagers, he and the studio thought that was just too hot a button to press in this story, and so they changed the ending. With this film's obvious intelligence and style, I would have liked to have seen it follow through with its intentions, and give us the tough, tragic story it wants to tell. But it doesn't, and thereby, as good as it is in many moments, it fails."
"August1991","4","1","2","16 September 2003"," My Two Cents...
","This film reflects what many non-Americans seem to think about America and Americans.  Except, the film uses American ""language"" to make its point. Hence, the film is difficult for non-Americans to understand and at the same time, it seems surprising or fresh to some Americans.  (I suggest watching this film with an American/non-American.)<br/><br/>With all that said, the film arguably misses the point about suburban, middle class Americans who, in my experience, are much more genuine and civilized.  In this, I found the film dishonest and more vapid than the characters it portrayed.<br/><br/>Lastly, I hate pretentious films with devices such as floating plastic bags masquerading as artistic insights.  Gimme a break.  If you want a character study of rich middle-class Americans in crisis, rent ""Ordinary People"". It's more accurate and beautiful, but without the pretension."

","I almost pity myself. How I wasn't able to comprehend this movie a couple of years ago is totally beyond me. I hated it, despised it actually and right now, after giving it a second view I understand why a couple of people actually bothered and sent me practically threatening letters. Now I know why; how can you not love this movie. A raw satire that doesn't show life from a perspective, it just shows it, period! It shows us that life is very beautiful, you just have to do something with it and not let others run it for you. And that's exactly what Lester Burnham does. Wow,  at least I didn't overlook Mr. Spacey's performance the first time around. His performance deserved all the positive attention it got and I know exactly what won over the Oscar people. It was the smile when Jane Burnham(Mena Suvari) tells him his daughter (Thora Birch) is really happy because she's in love. Perhaps the most endearing, most authentic(if you put yourselves into his shoes) and most wonderfully sincere smile I have ever seen. For real. What an immature person I must have been less that two years ago to find this movie both boring and sad. It is one of the highlights of the previous decade and to those who found my first comment, shall I say, offensive- I truly apologize and hope that I've learned to become a more experienced movie fan to not let pieces of sheer beauty like this slip by me. A wonderful cast that truly shines in the last half hour makes ""American Beauty"" amazing. Adding great cinematography, music and direction makes it a masterpiece. 9/10"

","I watched this film for the second time, and was left feeling very ambivalent.  On the one hand, there is so much to admire: the witty, literate script; Kevin Spacey's completely persuasive performance; the support work of Chris Cooper, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari and the marvellously oily Peter Gallagher; and some great cinematography.<br/><br/>The fly in the ointment was a feeling I was left with with that the main female characters (or certainly three of them) in the film are crude caricatures, in contrast to the complex and nuanced characters played by Spacey, Wes Bentley and even the seemingly straight-out-of-central-casting Chris Cooper.  Most obviously there is Carolyn, whom Lester calls at one point a dried-up old bitch, or something like that.  She is portrayed as hysterical, shrewish, over-ambitious, pathetically insecure and domineering, and is pretty much without any redeeming features.  She even has lousy taste in music!  Lester has come to hate her, and my feeling was that the audience was being invited to feel contempt and hatred for her too.  I found this extremely grating, although this was not a criticism of Annette Bening's acting, more of the script and direction.<br/><br/>Then there is Angela, the would be slut, who has a mind like a sewer and is completely shallow and obsessed with appearances.  At the end, one sentence from Ricky is enough to burst her bubble of self-delusion and send her crying into Lester's arms.  Admittedly, her last scene does show a different side to her, but it is one that has been occasioned by an insult from a man and then nurtured by another man.  All-in-all, a cipher.<br/><br/>And what of Ricky's hapless mother?  Some very imaginative suggestions have been made on these message boards to explain why she is the way she is, but I think these suggestions are being overly generous to the filmmakers, as to me none of it is in the script.  She seemed like a pitiable, catatonically stricken woman who was just there.<br/><br/>Jane is easily the most complex and fully realised of the female characters; even here, though, I found myself wondering whether this was simply down to the fact that Thora Birch is so damn good that she wrung more subtlety out of the character than was originally there (witness her superb performance in Ghost World for another exhibition of her brilliance).  I found there was a dissonance between what's in the script (she's a f*ck-up) and what I saw on screen, which is in many ways the film's most sympathetic character.  She even says more than once that she's a bad person, and that it isn't surprising she's so screwed up, with such weird parents. <br/><br/>
Certainly, Lester's attitude towards Jane is pretty contemptuous, until right at the end.  He only sides with her when he's battering his wife's taste in music.  It's as if his daughter is just another woman put on earth to make his life a misery.  He laments that she would never confide in him, but never asks himself about his own responsibility and his part in her upbringing.  But hey, this film isn't about a dysfunctional family, it's about one man, the worm that turns against his oppressors and becomes a hero.  Sod the women, this is a guy's wish-fulfilment fantasy.  Cheer on Lester Burnham, give Spacey an Oscar (and it is a terrific turn from him) - the film still leaves a nasty taste in my mouth."

Well Spacey won an Oscar for his work and he can keep it. He's great here. He imbues Lester with, initially, a browbeaten weariness, that turns into a great line in sardonic behaviour. There's a great sense of fatalism about his character (apart from knowing his impending death), as if he knows his new life is a sham also. The fact that he can be incredibly witty but also show the human underneath it all (such as the bitterness directed at his wife), says a lot of Spacey's talents. Quite how he sunk so low afterwards puzzles me. Bening, who was Oscar nominated, is similarly great as a woman losing control. Her control freak nature, belied by a streak of insecurity, is all too believable. In fact all the cast acquit themselves here, all with a darkness inside them (in the case of Ricky and his family), or deep-rooted lack of identity (the Burnhams). Kudos to all.<br/><br/>Story? Well Alan `Six Feet Under' Ball does a fine little job here too. The script has emotional drama and darkness (quite bleak at times too), but never loses its sharp wit. It's a balance that is very difficult to achieve but, bless Ball, he does it. The real comedy comes from Lester's newly found laidback observational take on life, where nothing seems to phase him. His reactions, bounced off other characters, can be priceless (his nonchalant snarky remarks to his wife's rival are hilarious). The comedy is never at the expense of the story nor vice-versa. It's too black for that. The story is tinged with a hint of sadness but with a small amount of hope too, with a lot of it summed up in the famous `dancing bag in wind' piece in the movie.<br/><br/>Directing? Well Sam Mendes got an Oscar for his work here (against some excellent competition in the last good year for movies, 1999). Well done to him too. There's an excellent soundtrack for starters (Oscar-nominated). There's a great use of moody lighting and nice framing of shots, et cetera. The symbolic use of rose (American beauty is a type of rose) is actually handled in a manner that does not irritate, despite being somewhat heavy handed on occasion. There are some particularly lovely touches  such as the sharp cuts employed when Lester is engaging in a fantasy, that really help us delve into the character's psyche. Overall Mendes lends a very polished hand to an already polished script, and coaxes great performances from his cast.<br/><br/>Is `American Beauty' perfect? No, but it is very good. It's most certainly worthy of a viewing to show how you how it is possible to do a drama laced with black comedy and do it very well. And how Hollywood can surprise us and produce an excellent script. More movies like this would be very very welcome. 8.7/10."

I'm still missing a lot of things.<br/><br/>I just don't get Spacey's character, for one.<br/><br/>He is clearly portrayed as a complete clutz in the first quarter of the film - letting his briefcase spill open, tripping up in the aisle etc. But he doesn't physically LOOK like a clutz. He looks like K Spacey, Oscar winning actor. I found it very hard to believe this whole clutz thing.<br/><br/>
Which brings me to my main point, being, as viewers, we are really given no clue as to why Lester has this complete head transplant. We see very little of his job, tho we eventually discover he earns approx $60k a year - not bad for a loser/clutz. He is married to a beautiful woman, and has a slightly weird ( though not overly weird) daughter.<br/><br/>What happened to make him change so violently ? No psychobabble please....<br/><br/>In a drama such as this, which I believe sold itself on character realisation, I just couldn't believe in, or have any real sympathy for the main character.So I had to give this film a D-.<br/><br/>This rating takes into account the wholly overplayed use of the roses metaphor - which is pushed in one's face at every opportunity - the soap opera stereotypes, and the poorly conceived, written-on-the-back-of-a-napkin ending.<br/><br/>But I'll move it up to a C+ for the excellent music, The King, and Annette Bening, who is truly my ideal of a friends mom.<br/><br/>Now please excuse me while I go buy some G13....."

Come to think of it, that's a pretty good question, in a vapid split-level quest for meaning, but not enough to raise it above all those other postmodern predeath quasi-comedies.  It was certainly palatable to the masses, who reacted to its wildly contrived ending and the truth of the disembodied narration in much the same way as that other metaphysical mass market marvel, The Sixth Sense.

","It is marginally understandable that so many people are convinced that American Beauty is a masterpiece.  As an audience pleaser it succeeds brilliantly in doing what so many award winning films have done before it: it places the viewer up on a high pedestal from which he/she can judge the characters and events taking place from a morally superior vantage point. American audiences are easily seduced by films that are quick to wink at us and pat us on the back with each turn of the plot.  The truth about this film is, if you can ignore the incredible ego massage the film is attempting to give you, you'd realize how dishonest its intentions are: how the characters and situations are unrealistic, excessive, and overblown to the point of absurdity; how its gaudy stylistic flourishes are empty and pointless; how its painfully juvenile dialogue is hardly worthy of a UPN sitcom; how its supposed message is convoluted and self-contradictory, to the point that it is even recognizable.  This film is symptomatic of a curiously modern American delusion.  A vast majority of Americans believe that most American families are dangerously dysfunctional and that American family values are eroding in our culture.  At the same time, a vast majority of Americans believe that their own families are reasonably functional and that their family values are fine.  I suppose American Beauty can at least be given credit for successfully tapping into this confoundingly schizophrenic impulse in our culture.  I can give it credit for little else."

While the quality of the acting and production was at a high level, the core of this work seemed unhealthy, exploitative, and overbaked. While there is room for exposing the homogonized and more sober aspects of suburbia, ""American Beauty,"" in a quest to make itself more competitive with other versions of the truth, tended to exaggerate its own emphasis.

","After months of resisting the hype for this movie, I figured, hey, I like Sam Mendes's work - maybe American Beauty will turn out to be better than it looks in the previews.  Unfortunately I was wrong.  American Beauty really is just the same old recycled view of suburban family life wrapped in a slightly more intense package to grab the audience.  I don't see anything about Lester and Carolyn Burnam that is different from the various frustrated husband and wife roles that have come before.  The film's only saving grace is Wes Bentley and the concept of the intensity of life's beauty.  But that concept only surfaces a couple of times in the movie and is only *talked about* by the characters.  It is never supported by any events or by any of the characters.  It's as if American Beauty was just a very mediocre story about an unhappy family, and somehow the writer managed to throw in a very 'deep' quote.  Perhaps that plastic bag floating in the wind deserves the Best Actor nod - it was the only figure that really inspired."

","This film I was looking forward to because it was a fresh new director that I had never heard of and Kevin Spacey was in it, which is great for any film really, but not really.   Spacey was really good in this film and without him it would have bad, because he drives you throughout and I can't imagine anybody pulling off his charisma in the way he does, but that's it.  The rest of the film is one of those trying to prepare you for the future movies, where you are trying to be convinced that this is the way your life will be when you hit your male mid life crisis.   I just thought this film to be educational which is not a bad thing, Bowling for Columbine taught me that, but sometimes when you think that your life is going great, you all of a sudden get brought down by being reminded that this could happen to you. I for some reason do not believe in this, I think a human being will be doing what they do at any age good or bad because they were meant to be. We all have choices to make our life a better one, this film just shows you a man pulling away from his family when he should have been grabbing onto them, but then again the film is based around the tragedy of life, so to most of you what I just said is probably a load of rubbish.   Still this film only got its audience by crap one liners from a great actor who should have not been in this film.   I think the main reason I hated it so much was Thora Bird, The guy who likes to watch plastic bags float and film them (what a nerd)  and dysfunctional family life which does not interest me in the slightest, apart from Parenthood that was a classy film which took itself seriously."

","[This comment contains spoilers.]<br/><br/>""American Beauty"" is a perfect film. The cast, the script, the score, the directing well, everything is perfect. I hardly know what to say about this film because even though I cannot stop thinking about it (scenes from the film keep playing in my head and everything from advertising to a journalist's column in a newspaper can make me remember certain scenes from the film) I find myself almost at a loss for words. This is because ""American Beauty"" is true. I have never seen a film that is so true. The shallowness of Angela which she hides under a mask of sexual experience, which is a lie, and then a glimpse of depth in her person, a hope for depth, when she actively takes interest in another person's life by asking Lester (Spacey) how he's doing. And that is just one example of the magnificent characterization in this film. How the film portrays Lester's metamorphosis is even more impressive. And by the end, when he realizes that what's important is his wife and daughter, not the image of his old self, it's completely breathtaking. Of course, without Lester chasing the old ghost of himself, youth lost, he would never have learnt that. And it's sad that he had to die right after feeling happy and fulfilled. And when Lester tells the audience of the never-ending last second of life, it's truly beautiful. He talks of the feel of his grandmother's skin, about Carolyn (Bening) and then he tells us he saw Jane and Jane. I think it's beautiful how he mentions her twice.<br/><br/>Naturally, I could talk about every character's metamorphosis, but then this ""review"" would be too long to ever be read so I'll stop there even though I'd love to talk about the Burnhams' neighbours as well.<br/><br/>Does my comment make ""American Beauty"" seem too serious? Well, fear not, because it's also one of the funniest films I've seen the last few years (together with the very funny and brilliant ""Fight Club""). The humour and jokes ranges from the sophisticated and witty to the old ""Ooops, tripped on somebody's foot there!"" Pure brilliance. Awe-inspiring performances from Spacey (of course), Bening, Bentley, and Cooper. Impressive performances from Birch and Suvari. The script is perfect and the directing likewise.

","Today I finally saw American Beauty and I must say that it is awesome. Actually only one other film made me feel this way in 1999 which is Fight Club and as much as I feel sad for the ultimate commercial failure of that one, I am extremely happy that for once, a film as mercilessly critical of the consumerist society of our contemporary world as American Beauty has for once been embraced by the American film-going public. It clearly struck a chord throughout that country and deservedly so. A faultless and constantly witty script turns all the cliches of American suburban life, that seemingly untouchable microcosm of American lifestyle upside down. That said, its main themes and considerations are apparently  universal enough since it was able to draw constant heartfelt response -whether chokeful aughter, worried cry or deadly silence - from a packed audience of all ages as far away from the troubles and tribulances of the American family as Turkey at the screening I attended. All of the cast shines but the film is a clear tour de force for Kevin Spacey. His is a performance that is able to connect with the viewer even though the character does not invite 100 per cent identification. If there is any justice, he should be given every acting trophy in this world for this performance. After an instable choice of fils and big voids of non-acting due to pregnancies, it is a relief to see Annette Bening on top form again. She is one of the finest actresses around and she perfectly captures this all-American careerwoman who is constantly on the verge of hysteria although the character sometimes dangerously ventures into the territories of caricature. The three young actors are all incredibly talented and sholud be congratulated for bravely taking these roles in an age where most young actors choose to chart the safe waters of teen comedies and slasher flicks. It is hard to believe in the transformation of Thora Birch from the cute little girl she has been in the likes of Monkey Trouble and All I Want for Christmas into the confused and, frankly, evil-intentioned adolescent of this film. Mena Süvari displays the perfect physical embodiment of what constitutes beauty and both she and Wes Bentley have clearly great career prospects ahead of them. A gem through and through."

Not one of them could evoke some sympathy in my eyes...."
"moviebrats","10","1","2","8 February 2000"," Every single frame is adorable!
","Believe me, I've seen a lot of movies (each year a try to watch about 200 films I have not seen before), but American Beauty surpasses everything. It's the best picture I've ever seen. I never before focused on one single film as my favorite (there were always about 1,000 fav films), but with American Beauty it is different. It's just perfect, brilliant, marvelous, divine. Every single frame is adorable - and yet, it's so simple - there is no need for hoards of extras, for elaborate sets or meaningful events in the course of the story. Just a few strange people, people just like us. This film features some of the best acting performances ever to be seen on screen, esp. Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Wes Bentley & beautiful Thora Birch. Witty & intelligent dialogue that's rare in today's cinema, and the structure of Alan Ball's script is just perfect - the best plot narration I can imagine. Marvellous cinematography - one of the rare pictures in current cinema that denies fast-paced camera moves, but instead just sits there in static images that tell you so much more than every camera move ever could. I'd like to say more about that film, but my breath is still taken from watching it the fifth time last night. Besides, I fail further words that could describe it. It's just masterly accomplished regarding any aesthetics, the contents, the acting, the photography, the editing, the story, the art in itself...<br/><br/>A grateful bow to first-timer Sam Mendes and his crew."
"Stephen-12","10","1","2","7 February 2000"," Beautiful and compelling
","I know this is comment no. 940, but what the hell.<br/><br/>American Beauty is in some ways the antithesis of the equally brilliant Fight Club. Both concern men with their best years behind them, stuck in meaningless, middle-class jobs, who embrace extreme behaviour in an attempt to recapture meaning in their lives, with fatal consequences. Fight Club is the more dangerous, more radical and ultimately more nihilistic side of the coin. American Beauty is on safer territory, but its ultimate vision of the beauty of life is more affirmative and uplifting. Both films are masterpieces in their individual ways, but it says something about Hollywood that American Beauty will probably win the Oscar, whereas Fight Club probably won't even be nominated.<br/><br/>On top of this, one can only marvel at the performances, at Thomas Newman's wonderful and memorable score, at Conrad Hall's glowing photography, at the poised and profound script, and at Mendes's loving direction, his debt to theatre immediately obvious. The plastic bag sequence had me in tears. If a film leaves me feeling, as Ricky puts it, that God has looked straight at you, then I give it a 10, whatever its flaws. Like Good Will Hunting, this film transcends cinema and touches your life, without ever stirring your cynicism. For that reason alone, American Beauty is a triumph."
"brucel-2","3","1","2","30 January 2000"," A big let down
","After being exposed to all of the hype for weeks now, I've decided to see this much praised movie. Unfortunately, I was not the least bit impressed. Maybe it just didn't live up to the hype in my eyes.  To me, the movie was about a fairly mentally ill family, so to speak, which is just not an uplifting or interesting subject to watch. Many people grew up in emotionally challenged families and coming to watch more of it for $8.00 isn't my idea of fun.  The actors played their roles well for the most part, but Kevin Spacey was a little unbelievable in his role. I just hope that this isn't what America has come to, which is enjoying the interaction of mentally challenged people. I think too many Springer fans rated this movie as the great thing it is not."
"minstrel","3","1","2","30 January 2000"," Not a movie you want to see
","It's a pity audiences tend to think of this movie as a ""great"" movie. Having a very able actor playing the lead role (Spacey, soon to get the Oscar he deserve), as well as writing a half decent script and giving it to a imaginative director just doesn't make a movie ""great"" or merely ""good"". It takes much  more than that. If your really taken by this movie just have a peek at the original, Kubrick version, of Lolita - almost the same story as this film, but quite a different affair. Kubrick doesn't only use better actors, better script and music, but he stays true to his cause, something Mendes simply cannot claim to have done.<br/><br/>I will not give the film's plot away, but for those who've seen it, just think how unlikely is the ending, and how the director is really not interested in making any kind of statement by choosing such a soft, ""mellow"" sort of an ending. Sure, that's probably far from the original scripted ending, but when you're young, having mighty ""DreamWorks"" as your production company makes you do all those concession you promised yourself you'll never make.<br/><br/>If you're still not convinced, just think of the opening scene - which is repeated, as a sort of a symptom, later in the movie. Was it necessary, or is this scene just plain redundant? Having said that regarding both the ending & opening scenes, you may think it's a very flawed film. Well, you'll be right, but you've seen worse coming out of Hollywood recently. Please see Kubrick's ""Lolita"" for a good film on the very same subject, but one which is original, funny & brilliantly directed, yet much, much more disturbing than the ""ground braking"" American Beauty."
"Stroheim-3","10","1","2","24 September 1999"," Terrific
","Let me just say that one rarely sees a movie with a perfect cast.  Here it is.  Spacey and Benning give career defining performances in what is hands down the first real Oscar/Golden Globe contender of the year.  In addition, the supporting cast (if one can call them supporting) is fabulous especially the drug dealing neighbor has these piercing eyes that make you hang onto his every word (just like Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs).<br/><br/>The movie itself is a tightly constructed narrative that can really speak to the viewer if he wants to listen.  In a miserable, routine existence find something - ANYTHING - that will make you truly happy.  It's relatively straightforward.<br/><br/>When seeing this film, note that it is a first effort from the director who does an amazing job.  The visual symbolism and the mise-en-scene is outstanding.  This is quite possibly the best freshman attempt at filmmaking since Frank Darabont made The Shawshank Redemption."

","This is a strange and engaging movie that one must see with others in order to have someone to discuss with afterwards, similar to another great film from this year, ""Election."" The acting is top-notch, and expect one or more to be nominated for a Golden Globe and/or Academy Award, and possibly an accolade for the movie itself as well. It's deservedly rated R for some language and sexual situations, but doesn't go overboard with either. 'American Beauty' makes no attempt to preach a moral nor would one work because we are seeing the most extreme of every personal and family stereotype, and very humorously in many cases, heavy-handed in others. An additional plus is the music, which uses deep bass in conjunction with subtle piano strokes to create a black comedy atmosphere for the ages."

He doesn't usually play very likeable characters, and Lester is perhaps, in his own way, the most angry and antagonistic of all of them. Yet he manages to make him sympathetic, almost a hero even.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is excellent all around, but to me the show belongs to Spacey. This will be remembered as one of the important films in his career."

'American Beauty' has beautiful cinematography, editing that screams along with the pacing, tremendous acting, and a wickedly funny script. Best Picture of the year... no doubt.

"Cioran","10","1","2","14 January 2000"," a spectacularly entertaining and thought provoking achievement
","Often when reading or hearing other people's reviews or comments about some film I wonder if we've watched the same film at all. This especially applies to this film.<br/><br/>This film - again - is about liberation from cowardice, social roles, self-denial people so often put themselves in. The sadness and humorous irrationality of the character's lives alternate constantly. Brilliant satirical comments and the tragedy of existence are always present in this fine film. The transformation of somnambulent, internally dying, fed up Lester (Kevin Spacey, who is awesome, superb in every scene) is very similar to Fight Club's Jack's transformation to non-conformist, socially liberated and confident Tyler Durden. Though Fight Club is even better film than this.<br/><br/>Lester hates his work, he hates the circumstances and interactions he finds himself in, he feels beaten to the ground without getting up, at least not without help.  After feeling comatose and humiliated for some time, the beautiful teen age vixen Angela (Mena Suvari, great role) triggers some change in his sexually deprived monotonous life. He starts fantasizing of her submerged into corny surroundings with red flowers. Angela's comments to Jane about her father's lacking muscles prompt him to become an addict of weight lifting. Which together with his re-acquired habit of smoking weed from his new neighbor Ricky Fitts (impressive Wes Bentley) rejuvenate him. He starts feeling alive - confident and good about himself. Prepared to improve his life. He believes he is not such 'a colossal loser' after all.<br/><br/>The wife Carolyn (wonderfully hysterical Anette Bening) and the daugther Jane (beautiful Thora Birch) are confused about Lester's sudden change. They are all alienated from each other. Carolyn resents Lester's sudden irresponsibility and tries to fill her life with goods and material success. As long as the facade is fine and her material situation good, all is well. She has succumbed to superficial pretentiousness and has reduced herself to a caricature, whose main goals are to maintain the facade of a happy family, success in her work and gaining more materia. She is an impostor.<br/><br/>Voyeurist Ricky films everything he can with his camera so not to forget the transient, ephemeral nature of things. He wants to remember the beauty of a particular moment - be it death of a bird or a leaf in the wind. There's a lot of zen in some of his comments, he he has learned to see beyond the appearance - beyond the facade. His own tragic existence according to structure and the rules his father colonel Fitts (Chris Cooper) has laid down for him has pushed him to value the unique beauty of various phenomena. Colonel Fitts has beaten his family into submission - his wife is lethargic, but Ricky still hustles and attempts to find something meaningful. He understands life as an ephemeral experience that has to be seized fully and passes his attitude to Jane & Lester.<br/><br/>Eventually the film is about the fragility of life - death can come arbitrarily and unexpectedly- through no mistake of yours or via just a misunderstanding. You live only once and there's lots of potential beauty you miss when living the daily routine consists of chasing the things you don't really need. Or even if you need, it takes courage to wonder at things and it takes a lot courage to let go and be free - to be honest to yourself and happy."

Despite some elements that warrant the R-rating, this movie doesn't have anything 'cheap' in it. The story definitely takes a fresh view on things!<br/><br/>And I didn't think this movie was 'sad' or 'tragic' at all, just incredibly beautiful!<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to pretty much everybody, but especially for the people who get bored with how similar movies often are to each other..."

","Films like ""American Beauty"" reinstall my often decreasing faith and love for American cinema.  This film showcases in heartbreaking clarity the desire to connect with another human being that each one of us feels. Lester is trying to connect to his daughter through her best friend, his wife is trying to connect with him through having an affair, and his daughter is trying to connect with him through her boyfriend.  The boy next door is trying to connect with the beauty he sees in the girl next door, and his father has a desire to connect with his ""secret,"" but pushes that away through his homophobic rantings.  <br/><br/>This film vividly portrays how disconnected American society has become by showcasing the ""American Dream"" as a dreary, empty bore.<br/><br/>I also applaud this film for both laughing at and deeply appreciating all the characters.  In the beginning each is a stereotype who evolves through the movie's progression into real people who feel empty and who eventually learn how to enjoy life on some level.<br/><br/>I hope there will be Oscars all around for this film and Kevin Spacey will inevitably win Best Actor.  However, I fear this film may suffer a similar fate that ""Bulworth"" did in 1998.  That too was a biting social satire that was grossly underrated by both the public and the Academy."

This just may be the best photographed film of the year.  But it does not make up for a poor script, directionless direction, and a series of characters that are nothing more than cliches.<br/><br/>Haven't we seen the mid-life crises male played before?  Haven't we seen the wife and mother who is married to her career before?  Haven't we seen the gung-ho, homophobic Marine Corps colonel before?  Haven't we seen all these characters in better movies?

Lester is tired of his Dilbertesque job.  He extorts money from the company and quits to go work at a hamburger stand.  Carolyn hates her life and feels inadequate at her job so she has an affair.

Angela is a foul-mouthed American beauty that wants everyone to believe she's the neighborhood tramp.<br/><br/>These pathetic people are not worth watching for 2 hours, especially when the film's narrator tells you he's dead before the story starts.

","I believe that everyone should see this movie.  Aside from the fact that the acting borders on phenomenal and the fact that the cinematography and script were masterpieces in themselves, the THEME of this movie should be witnessed by all.<br/><br/>I have read many reviews that talk about how this movie is trying to express how complete devotion to our jobs and material goods leaves us empty and worthless as human beings.  I have also read reviews that claim this movie tells us what happened to our good old American family values.  And while these claims are completely accurate, they are still only part of the deeper message presented in this film.  I know that the title is ""American Beauty,"" but I believe that it is only being used as a symbol, like everything else in the movie.  Yes, America is know worldwide for its excesses in all forms, so it is a good example of a trend that plagues humanity as a whole.<br/><br/>See, the emphasis of this movie is on beauty.  Not beauty as we normally think of it, but beauty as all that should be admired and respected and loved in the world.  ""American beauty"" represents what we are TAUGHT to perceive as beautiful.  A nice car, a supermodel, and so on.  The message I got from this movie is that nature is beautiful, and by nature I mean everything in this world in its natural state.  Humans are beautiful when they are honest, but not when they try to fit the molds our societies make for us.  This is so well expressed in one scene in the movie when Ricky is asked why he is filming a dead bird and he replies, ""Because it's beautiful.""<br/><br/>Ricky later shows us the most beautiful thing he ever filmed: a plastic bag being blown by the wind.  The symbolism here is magnificent!  The plastic bag, as a representative of man made culture, being completely controlled and driven by pure nature.  This movie doesn't condemn our society and point fingers at the causes of our unhappiness.  Instead it gives us hope and direction toward a better path that we left a long long time ago.  Don't let anyone tell you that this isn't a happy movie, for it is full of hope. And more importantly, it is full of beauty.  See this movie, and more importantly, THINK about this movie."
"t.bedlam","Null","1","2","10 October 1999"," A near perfect rose
","I can't believe this is only Alan Ball's first writing credit. _AB_ is not a naturalistic film by any means, not like _The Accidental Tourist_ or _Shoot the Moon_. It is entirely artifice, especially in circular plot construction and directing flourishes, but it matches art with a big, beating, very human heart. The acting and directing are top notch--my only complaint is that one or two images might have been _more_ arresting, and that _AB_, like most American films, seems to refuse to let two actors do their stuff in a single two shot--rather, they insist on cutting back and forth between the two even when dramatically unnecessary, as for a reaction shot. Sometimes this is used to cover bad acting, but I find it hard to believe Spacey & Co. needed cover of that color.<br/><br/>My only other complaint is that what may have been the most tragic character in the film is made too unlikeable, and fails to seize our sympathy. Had the character been allowed to win it, the movie's end would be doubly powerful. While prejudice may be loathsome, movies are _not_ about prejudice--they are about people. And this film has some great people in it. You will be kicked in the head. Do not resist."

Warning don't get worked up over it because the end experience is as empty as Lester Burnham's life, the one portrayed by Kevin Spacey, who sets forth to fill out the stereotype of the all American WASP father of 9 to 5 is a vacuum.  We have all seen this done better in The Ice Storm and with more originality in Blue Velvet.  Spacey deserves all the praise that will be coming down the pike on his performance here and it is entirely on his shoulders that the film is carried with let downs from Bening and Birch.  Be on the look out for key words like American suburban, middle- class, midlife crisis, and dysfunction along with psychological, sexual, sociological to keep popping up when this film is mentioned.  These themes drive critics wild but Brit. Alan Ball does nothing more with it than take its long history in film, theater and lit and rearrange the parts, a formula for success on Broadway these days so Hollywood is not far behind.

I didn't find this movie entertaining at all, and I didn't find it insightful, or revealing of American suburbia.   Virtually every character in the movie is grossly dysfunctional to a comical degree. Perhaps the most being the wife of the neighbor.  She is comically catatonic, and unresponsive to her surroundings, and her husband doesn't seem to notice, or care.  The Kevin Spacey character is nearly completely estranged from his wife and daughter, but doesn't really seem to be all that concerned about either as he pursues a relationship with his daughter's friend, and smokes pot, and works fast food as his wife cheats on him. His daughter seems to appreciate the attention of the neighbor.  Anyone else would have been treating him as a stalker, and getting a restraining order against him.  And the young man (who sees beauty in everything), seems to have a rather elaborate and open drug selling business out of the home, that seemed comical given his relationship with his tyrant father.<br/><br/>I didn't identify with any character in the move, I don't know any one like any character in the movie, I don't think a bag blowing in the wind is beautiful, and I just didn't get it."

","When I go to the movies and see a film from the American family genre I expect that it's going to give me a slice of the current reality of family values.  Nice try American Beauty but your shoes cannot fill the likes of Ordinary People.  The fact is that Ordinary People existed long before Terms of Endearment, The Ice Storm, and American Beauty and it got everything right.  It was real.  I can see how some families play favorites and suffer the ramifications of a child's death so much that they forget that they still have a son who is alive and well and dying for attention.  That said American Beauty exists as a trifle that achieves some level of greatness but is far too unrealistic to be considered 20 years from now.<br/><br/>  Consider how Lester Burnham is a pediophile who loves to get naked in his garage while he lifts his weights.  Consider how he gives a long and strange speech about oral sex to his boss to get severance pay and then winds up working at a fast food restaurant.  Does this remind you of your father?  Or for that matter how Annette Bening is a materialistic mother who would rather have her Italian sofa for all of her ""future guests"" to see than accept her husband's long awaited advances.  Huh?  Did I miss something? There is nothing American or human for that matter about these characters. They are lifeless and soulless and they exist only as cartoons.  Their actions make no sense.<br/><br/>  When you take the time to rent Ordinary People you see a slice of the reality of the American family.  Donald Sutherland is a tax attorney who allows his son to make mistakes along the way but never ever gives up on him.  Aren't the majority of baby-boomer fathers like that?  Mary Tyler Moore plays Beth Jarrett as one of the coldest and meanest mothers ever to grace cinema.  She plays favorites with her boys and leaves all of her love in the grave with her deceased son.  Don't a lot of parents who have lost children behave as though a part of them died as well?<br/><br/>  American Beauty achieves something unique but it's not something I'll be pondering 20 years down the road.  Kevin Spacey is brilliant with his role but you can truly tell that he was trying to make human a man who simply wasn't written as anything more than a caricature.  Annette Bening over-acts throughout the film and she simply doesn't know that we get it already, your a selfish and psychotic shrew!  The cinematography is excellent though I often ask myself how many roses died before this film was considered a wrap. Thora Birch proves here and later in Ghost World that she can act with the best of them.  American Beauty does entertain and there is never a dull moment.  Does it matter and is it memorable though in the long term?<br/><br/>8/10"

It's not supposed to be happy because it's supposed to be like real life.  Well if this movie is anything like real life than I don't know what country I've been living in for the last eighteen years.<br/><br/>The father realizes he hates his job and that it is getting him no where, so he quits and works at a fast food restaurant?

I also think it's not worth watching. It shouldn't have won 5 academy awards. It was unfair because there were wonderful movies in 1999 like ""Snow falling on cedars"" and ""Angela's ashes"" that should have been over-rated. I was very disappointed after knowing it won an academy award for best picture. Why? It's just about an American family who gets in a lot of sex and drugs trouble. I think it's very disappointing; it's not even funny. It didn't make me laugh at all. I couldn't just believe it won 5 academy awards. What message does this movie leave you for your life? I think none, because it doesn't teach us anything; however I like a scene in this movie; it is as Lester's neighbor tries to kiss him on the lips because he thinks he's homosexual. I thought the neighbor was homophobic at the beginning, but he wasn't. It showed us that things are often different from what they might be. It also showed us the true side of human nature, which is certainly the only thing worth watching in this.  This scene made me think a lot. It's undeniable that Kevin Spacey acted well. I think he is a great actor; nevertheless he couldn't save this a little.<br/><br/> Let's analyze it, every character in this movie is quite different because they have so many personally and individual important meanings, thoughts, hopes, feelings, etc. This is very valuable to me. It requires much discussion.<br/><br/> Overall this is a failed movie that was thoroughly over-rated. 4 out of a 10"
"sinkerhawk","4","1","2","2 January 2002"," Nothing can save this stinker.
","I read that this movie was supposed to be a view of a typical American family.  If the writer agrees with this, I am so glad not to be a part of his screwed up brood.  The Addams Family is more realistic.  This has got to be the most mixed up, convoluted piece of garbage I've seen.  The only redeeming value being Kevin Spacey's performance.  Why he chose to waste such talent on this movie, I will never understand.  And the garbage bag scene?  Who wrote that?  Lame, really lame.  4 of 10 stars.  (The fact that this movie is #17 in the list of greatest films is just wrong.)"
"rondine","9","1","2","30 November 2001"," surprising reactions...
","I was truly surprised reading the reactions of fellow IMDB patrons who didn't like this movie. I did. The main reason I liked this movie, for those that didn't get ""it,"" is that the movie is about looking closer to find the true beauty of things and finding one's self.<br/><br/>Most of you have probably heard a plot summary, but I will cover it briefly. Lester Burnham is a middle-aged man in an unhappy job & an unhappy marriage to Caroline. He has lost touch too with his daughter, Jane.<br/><br/>He is just going through the motions. Until one day, a quest with lust awakens him. <br/><br/>The new next door family to the Burhmans is the Fitts family. Comprised of a comatose mother (who epitomizes the furthest extreme of losing one's self completely) a homophobic ex-Marine and their son, a quiet, confident young man with a hidden source of strength.<br/><br/>The movie is mainly shot from Lester's point of view. But is deals quite a bit with superficial things in our society and how obsessed we become with them. A perfect example, Lester tries to get romantic with Caroline, they are on the sofa and just as he's about to make contact, she notices a beer bottle that he is about to spill. She tells him he's gonna spill some beer on the sofa. He says, ""so what?! it's just a sofa!"" and she says oh no it's not. It's an Italian, hand painted silk sofa! He retorts, ""IT'S JUST A SOFA! and it's become more important to you than living, we'll that's just crazy."" and it is. That is part of the message of this movie. Stupid, blind materialism in a world that perhaps, now more than ever, we know isn't a sure thing. This movie tries to say to those that heard it, live now, tomorrow is a gift you don't have.<br/><br/>Anyway, I thought it did a great job of saying that and was much less preachy than I!"

","I found this to be an excellently written and acted movie.  I wanted to give it the full 10, but I'm sorry to say I couldn't in the face of the atmosphere of depression I got after watching it a few minutes ago. Really it is a matter of personal taste, and it wasn't exactly an unhappy ending, but my somber state aside, a thoroughly pleasing movie."
"don*g","4","1","2","6 November 2001"," Not Oscar Winning Material
","I have been wary of high profile Oscar winning movies ever since Kramer vs Kramer and Ordinary People. America Beauty joins that group, very disappointing if you are looking for something special. There was plenty to think about (for your average 40 year old guy) - would I do those things, would I act like that - DO I act like that?? The themes took me back to high school English classes and that was quite good fun, but it was very much a movie of the onlooker, watching the ""roses falling"" scene; I was thinking - how did they do that? - I never became involved and sadly, the humour was too obviously subtle to do more than play with your emotions, in fact the whole movie was a bit like that - play on several levels but nothing to tip over into emotional connection with anything or anyone."
"srella","2","1","2","4 November 2001"," feeling sorry for a rich white guy
","How disappointing. I was expecting a wonderful case study of humanity, and instead I got served up an essay in white man's burden. I'm supposed to feel sorry for a middle-class white guy just because he doesn't want to have sex with his wife, has a boring (yet well-paying) job, and feels guilt about lecherously lusting after his teenage daughter's friend?<br/><br/>
American Beauty would be more appropriately titled American Ugly -- it showcases all that is gruesome and gluttoness in our society. There are so many other people to pity, so many other causes to champion, that American Beauty seems like a disgusting, pretentious affirmation of excess.<br/><br/>
The acting is better than the plot, but unfortunately, that is not saying much. Annete Bening truly deserved her Oscar nomination as a shallow, semi-ruthless real estate agent trying to figure out how to fulfill her own personal wishes with superficiality. And Chris Cooper, as usual, turns in a wonderful character performance. However, Kevin Spacey --- who went on to win the Oscar for his role --- was pretention itself. I never once felt pity for his character, and I never once believed, as he did, that he was entitled to anything more than his life gave him.<br/><br/>Catering to privileged white men? Feeling sorry for a married man because he wants to bed a teenager? C'mon. Let's change our priorities and maybe have them show through in the movies."
"pderocco","4","1","2","30 September 2001"," An eye-catching but mostly empty package
","What do we have here? Good direction, interesting cinematography, effective incidental music. The acting, while good, wasn't as impressive as most critics seemed to think. Kevin spacey appeared to be reprising his role from The Ref, a movie Annette Bening seemed to have watched for pointers from Judy Davis. One can find performances of this quality in any good television drama.<br/><br/>But when the clever surface is stripped away, what remains is a string of more 60's countercultural clichés than any single movie has strung together in quite a while. We have Hollywood's standard picture of suburbia, with trim lawns and expensive furniture hiding a maelstrom of perversion and misery. (I live in suburbia, and don't know people like this.) There is the henpecked Dad (Spacey), who works in the movies' ultimate symbol of phoniness, advertising. His wife (Bening) is in real estate sales, in a town where the housing market is dominated by a handsome but shallow, money-grubbing capitalist and womanizer. The only ""real"" human characters are their geeky, sensitive daughter and the geeky, sensitive boy next door, with whom the movie's sympathies obviously lie. And what does the boy do to finance his postmodern works of video art? He sells pot, and lies to his father about virtually everything. But that's okay, Dad is an ex-Marine who loves guns, collects Nazi memorabilia, beats his son, drives his long-suffering wife to insanity, and hates fags. Of course, he really is a fag--we all know homophobia is just a mask for latent homosexuality. As to guns, they are naturally only of interest to nut cases with sex problems, including Real Estate Mom, who is driven to obsessive target shooting by the end of the movie. And in a way, the movie revolves around the daughter's best friend, the canonical cheerleader who seduces her friend's Dad, and otherwise wallows in sluttiness.<br/><br/>How does Dad transcend this, get his life back, and become a truly sympathetic character? By smoking dope with the kid next door, blackmailing his boss, getting a new job flipping burgers, buying the Camaro he always wanted, and basically turning on, tuning in, and dropping out.<br/><br/>This all would have worked had it been satire, and I suppose some might claim that it is, but it didn't come across that way to me. Despite the semi-comedic histrionics of Spacey and Bening, the movie rarely seemed to be going for comedy, or even wit, let alone satire. But to minds who share the prejudices of its writers--which is to say, an awful lot of people in and around the movie biz--I can see how this stuff must seem awfully daring and profound."
"wabi","Null","1","2","6 September 2001"," If you didn't like it, look closer
","I've read the most recent 100 reviews here, and only 2 of them revealed any understanding of this movie.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS)<br/><br/>There's more here than just a satirical depiction of suburban America. This film is about the tension between three major schools of philosophy.<br/><br/>Lester Burnham tells you at the beginning that he might as well be dead. Why live if you don't have desire?  He's been without it for years, but once a spark re-ignites it, he embraces the existential view that choice defines who you are.  His view on work and marriage is reminiscent of Sartre's hell in ""No Exit"".<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ricky Fitts, the psycho guy next door who films everything, clearly represents Zen.  Consider this exchange he has with Jane about his decision to make a videotape of a homeless woman who had just died:<br/><br/>Jane: Why would you film something like that?<br/><br/>Ricky:  Because it was amazing.<br/><br/>Jane: What's amazing about it?<br/><br/>Ricky:  When you see something like that, it's like God is looking at you, just for a second, and if you're careful, you can look right back.<br/><br/>Jane: And what do you see?<br/><br/>Ricky:  Beauty.<br/><br/>Totally Zen.  Notice the video camera is a modern adaptation of the traditional Zen mind-as-mirror metaphor.  He then shows her a video of a plastic bag, ordinary to most people, against a brilliant red brick  all, which he ignores.  Ricky's commentary on it is textbook Taoism.<br/><br/>He never fights his father, the Marine colonel, but not out of fear.  He simply accepts his father's behavior and tries to adapt.  Col Fitts represents the Aristotelian view that the world is subject to order and taxonomy.  Notice the house is neatly arranged but starkly furnished, devoid of any warmth.<br/><br/>Judging from the variety of clients Ricky has, he's very well connected in the community.  His father of course is in denial about this, much as occidental science is reluctant to accept that people can find truth outside the realm of rational thought.  Notice also that Col Fitts struggles to reject his latent homosexuality -- it's something he can't account for through conventional reasoning.  This is an unusual but interesting metaphor of homosexuality as Truth.  (The gay couple, I think, represents the harmonious union of Truth and Beauty.  Notice how the two men look alike, dress alike, are both named Jim, and are always seen together.)  Also watch how the different characters react to Truth.  Western science sees it and realizes its own limitations.  Existentialism pursues it.  Zen simply accepts it.<br/><br/>Lester's natural liking for Ricky represents a certain affinity between Zen and existentialism.  On the opposite end of the spectrum are his wife Carolyn (superficial obsession with material wealth) and Jane's friend Angela (superficial obsession with physical beauty).   Both are afraid of being ordinary, because they can't see the beauty in the ordinary.  This division is underscored by the use of color: red represents surface beauty and blue represents depth.  Humorously, the use of red is visually obvious while the use of blue is subtle.<br/><br/>Jane, the angst-filled teenager in search of her own identity, is the perfect way to represent the philosophical problem of defining the self. Will she define it by her appearance, or by her choices, or will she ultimately repudiate the self?<br/><br/>American Beauty holds up a mirror in front of you and asks who's looking."

","I mean this movie could of been very good except for a couple key elements. The crazed i like to hit my child gay man next door. Didn't need his character to end like that, that was quite disturbing. Last but the most important is did this director have an obsession to see teens naked, a long seen with mena's breasts, and a scene of Birch's too. Not to mention some nudity of wes bentleys butt, all this nudity was very unnessary to the story, the movie would of done just as good without it. Sam mendes has potential, since this was only his second film, but he need to learn to develop a story with nudity, the better movies in history have not had nudity and neither do the movies today, like for example (Pearl Harbor - Epic movie, its got love, romance, action, war drama, and war action all without nudity. Except when the movie comes out on dvd, it will have a quick scene of Kate's rear, i think that is unnessary too). Sam Mendes your good but you actually could be great."

","This is the most overrated movie I have ever heard of. Even non-mainstream media hyped it up as a remarkable piece of cinema. Garbage - The plot was wishy washy and contrived. The scene involving the neighbour was so predictable, I almost looked away as it unfolded, not wanting to be right. The film's characters didn't lend any real support to the mediocre plot & script either. It totally frustrated me thinking there must be more to the movie right up to the saccharine (supposedly non-stereotyped) ending. I honestly walked out of this movie shaking my head in amazement thinking I had walked into the wrong cinema. The hype was all wrong. It is truly a movie which appeals to the production line movie goers who want a ""slightly, but not too offbeat"" movie.<br/><br/>Renting this movie is a waste of time unless you enjoy movies like ""parenthood"", and ""tootsie""."
"hagerp","7","1","2","25 June 2001"," A suburban Francis Macomber - Contains Spoilers
","It's pretty clear that Alan Ball was inspired by the Hemmingway short story, ""The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber"" when he wrote AMERICAN BEAUTY. Obviously Ball wanted to explore more themes than Hemmingway, and he paints on a broader canvass, but the essential plot is the same: a sad wimp of a man with an unloving and unfaithful wife gets his life together and achieves happiness on the same day he is shot in the back of the head and killed.<br/><br/>A significant departure in Ball's story is that the wife clearly intends to kill her husband but is pre-empted by the repressed homosexual neighbor, Colonel Fitts, whereas Macomber is killed by his wife in a manner that could be, but is assumed not to be, an accident.  The motivation for Macomber's wife and Burnham's wife to commit murder is essentially the same: they have both lost their power over their formerly spineless husbands.<br/><br/>Ball attempts to avoid Hemmingway's misogyny by giving the impression that Burnham's wife learns from her husband's death.  After discovering him, she breaks into tears and throws her gun in the trash.  Why it might be desirable to disarm oneself when a family member was killed by person or persons unknown, who might still be lurking in the shadows, is never explained.  Given the underlying politics of the film one might conclude that Burnham's wife ""finds"" herself by getting rid of the evil gun.  Another possibility is that the image we get throughout the movie of the wife as a self-absorbed idiot is just reinforced at the end and that she doesn't grow at all.<br/><br/>Despite the weak resolution of the wife's motivation/growth, the other significant characters are well drawn, if predictable.  The Colonel's son as an intelligent, artistic, and responsible young man who happens to be a big-time drug dealer is a nice touch.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Kevin Spacey's performance is what elevates this film to must see status.  I give it a 7 out of 10."
"Michael Lindberg","4","1","2","20 March 2001"," Not nearly as impressive or as meaningful as one may hope
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>By using a character that recognizes the beauty in the most insignificant details also be a dealer of an illegal substance (and thereby supplying Spacey's character with a means to fulfill a need), the movie is saying that by pandering to such a crowd, this idyllic character still must live in a world where you can take advantage of people and be selfish. Thus his initial characterization of a kind yet strangely observant character is rendered null by having him become part of what he begs to be rid of.<br/><br/>I also felt that the relationship between Spacey's daughter and the neighbor's boy would have been more powerful and connected had they not slept with each other. This clever trap helped destroy their gentle and far more interesting relationship based upon conversation rather than a purely lustful situation (had they known each other for longer, I could have accepted it as part of their evolution, but as it stands, it was a poor way to end an otherwise ""beautiful"" relationship).<br/><br/>The character of Lester is also one that confuses me. His sudden awakening to another plane of existance coexists with his wife's transformation as well. His behavior in front of his daughter's friend would certainly be party to questions. The symbolism of rose petals was also overused and too simplistic to carry a true meaning. It seemed to be more of an act of reading into the literature more than anything.<br/><br/>A comment about the DVD: the commentary track contained was very poor and did nothing to elevate the film beyond what I could see. It was nothing more than comments on how much they liked the shots (""and I love how his face comes into the light here"") and not what they were supposed to mean. At points, they tried to come up with meaning for some of the shots, but it came off as very corny and not worth listening to.<br/><br/>All in all, I was very disappointed that such a poor film has generated such a positive response from the general populace. Many of the people I discuss the film with who enjoyed it (consequently, these are only other high school students) simply come up with the phrase ""I liked it, but you didn't have to."" Many have balked at some of my arguments and have insisted that a particular sequence was as meaningful as many think. I think that most of the movie is tied up in itself. It appears that meaning has been inserted where none should exist, and when it does exist, it usually is corny and laughable."

","That this movie won the Oscar for Best Picture reflects more on the sorry state of Hollywood today than it does the quality of this movie.  Don't get me wrong, American Beauty is a perfectly enjoyable movie that occasionally rises above its sitcomy situation, but it is by no means a great movie - or even a really good one for that matter.  It's a little pretentious and feels more like a rebellion of classic tv than it does a real movie.  Still, the performances are decent and pace is enjoyable.  Kevin Spacey, while good, clearly did not deserve to win Best Actor.  The reason?  The way the chraracter was written, it could have been played by anyone.  Spacey does not have to stretch much for the role nor does he offer a real, layered performance.  He gets the character in broad strokes and flourishes but lacks true depth in his characterization.  It is unfortunate that American Beauty never develops its only truly interesting character - played by the sublime Thora Birch.  Instead, it offers an enjoyable, if somewhat stale and pretentious tale of family life in suburban America."

Sam Mendes is betrayed by his theatrical background, which renders his images as 2D tableau. It has impressive moments, and Kevin Spacey is a fine actor, but a lack of motivation, drive or substantial plot means it is incapable of providing a satisfying message or characterization. The teenagers exist as a limp sub-plot, the neighbour is a cartoon caricature worthy of Dick Dastardly (but not as funny) Annete Benning's falseness goes way beyond her character, and the whole thing  is nothing more than pretty pictures.

Some people may enjoy films like this, but I found it to be irritating.  A classic example of a director trying TOO hard to be TOO deep. <br/><br/>To the film's credit, I will say there were some great performances by Annette Bening and young Thora Birch. As for Kevin Spacey's performance... I have come to expect quality acting from him, so there is no surprise in this department.

Not to mention that this was a very well directed movie in that it showed the life of the average everyday family in a twisted view, which to some extent is an accurate depiction of the people in the society.  If you see this movie though, I will warn you that the movie is not exactly for everyone based on content, but there was a lot that can be learned in this movie.  If I were to compare American Beauty to any movie, I would have to cross Falling Down, together with war of the roses and to some extent some American History X, but this movie is unique in what it has done.

"Spleen","6","1","2","31 July 2000"," Some notes on how it ends
","I discussed this with a friend and she, too, didn't like the ending; her quarrels was quite different from mine, and I think we were both right.  I would advise you not to read on if you haven't seen the film.  Yes, I know it's announced right at the start that Lester will shortly be dead; that isn't what I'm about to reveal.<br/><br/>MY problems were as follows.  The film tells us about Lester's imminent demise TWICE at the start.  It struck me at the time as unnecessary; I later found it was done so as to manipulate us into a silly game of guessing and second-guessing towards the end.  Which one of the suspects before us will commit the fatal act?  Will it be (a) the daughter, acting in concert with her lover?  Or (b), the daughter's lover, acting alone?  Or (c), the frustrated wife, smarting with shame?  Or (d), the fascist-minded neighbour? In fact, we start by thinking we know that the answer is (a), but this is a trick of presentation that amounts to simple cheating.  By presenting a not particularly crucial scene TWICE Mendes makes it seem important.  But in any case, what's the point of this cat-and-mouse game with the viewer?  Suddenly the picture becomes conventional and just a little stale.<br/><br/>Well, as everyone still reading knows, the answer is (d), which brings me to my second problem.  The neighbour is driven to murder only because he's led to believe, falsely, that Lester is gay.  How does he come to believe this? Sheer, flimsy chance.  Had a window frame not conveniently occluded his view, had he not happened to watch a few ""incriminating"" minutes of videotape out of the hundreds of HOURS stored in his son's room, the tragedy would never have occurred.  It's almost an eighteenth-century farce.  Lester is not in any sense ""doomed to die"" at the start of the film; nor does he play with fire; his eventual death is as meaningless as, ""and then he was hit by a falling piano"", except that - and this is what makes it worse than the falling piano scenario - we are made to examine the fatal chain of events at ridiculous length.<br/><br/>Here are my friend's concerns.  She thought a sudden death at the end was simply gratuitous; a tacked-on piece of pessimism to a story the logical conclusion of which would be happy.  The death is (my friend pointed out) a good deal unhappier than I'd noticed.  There's no indication that the neighbour will even be suspected of the murder; there's every indication that Jane and Ricky WILL be suspected.  The videotape we saw twice will also be seen by the police.  The two lovers cannot now flee to New York, both of them are likely to be imprisoned, and, to add insult to injury, Lester (like the film as a whole) ignores their fate entirely in his blissful ruminations on life that are meant to sum up the story.  It's one thing to concentrate primarily on Lester to the exclusion of everyone else.  It's quite another to tell us Jane's story as well, showing us incidents that don't concern him and which he will never even find out about - and then, in the end, leave his daughter in the lurch by simply forgetting about her.  If Mendes wants to bring Lester's daughter into the story at all he can jolly well treat her with respect.<br/><br/>My long complaint may give a false impression.  As it happens a sour conclusion is not nearly enough to sour the film as a whole: it's just so GOOD throughout.  Simple, beautiful, moving scenes - the moment when Carolyn cries after degrading herself in front of potential customers, or the dinner-time argument after Lester quits work - are presented with an almost arrogant freshness; I was all the more disappointed with the conclusion because I had been lulled into believing that the film-makers were so skilled they couldn't possibly let me down.  (And - think what you will of me for saying this - the sight of Thora Birch undressing and standing there topless would be worth sitting through a bad movie to see, let alone this one.)  Taken all in all I'm very glad ""American Beauty"" was made."

","The main problem with this movie is that the premise is stereotypical and uninteresting. A guy going through a mid-life crisis decides to quit his job and buy a new car- is that really the best they could do? I've seen a few episodes of ""Full House"" about the same thing and they were equally as interesting. This wouldn't have been so bad, however, if the movie had continued being a comedy, since that's all it deserved to be. But instead, they had the arrogance to try to teach the audience a moral about how superficial and meaningless life is, as if we didn't know. The last half is painfully preachy and obvious, and the lines about ""all the beauty in this world"" are laughable. I do recommend seeing the first hour, though- Spacey is pretty funny. Then turn it off immediately."

"shrine-2","5","1","2","11 June 2000"," Shallow and overwrought
","Moviegoers must be suffering from some kind of pre-millennium fatalistic malaise to mistake ""American Beauty"" for a work of depth.  Written by Alan Ball who produced CBS' ""Cybill,""  this movie shares with the sitcom that contempt for anything outside its own narrow sphere of values.  What's worse is this time around Ball tries to pass them off as universal.  Its basic pieties are embodied by one Lester Burnham (played way over the top by the sly Kevin Spacey), and we are asked to trust that his newfound ""freedom"" (Burnham quits his thankless job of 14 years after blackmailing his employer for a year's salary and benefits.) is an example for his control-freak wife (Annette Bening in an embarrassingly overwrought performance) and maybe the rest of us anal-retentives in the audience to follow and quit wallowing in the worship of things and missing the point about the meaning of life. Question is did it ever occur to Ball that there are a lot of us out here who manage to experience the beauty that life has to offer, even when we still sit squirming over where we are going to make the next mortgage or car payment?  I don't expect a Hollywood insider like Ball has to worry about that, and Lester Burnham uses blackmail to avoid the money-grubbing trap that's caught the rest of us poor 9-to-5 lunkheads.  Is it any wonder that Burnham's daughter (Thora Birch) is mortified by her father's behavior? The movie languishes over his getting wistful over her underage confidante (Mena Suvari) so unabashedly, that the same queasy feeling you had when Woody Allen was eying Mariel Hemingway up and down in ""Manhattan"" overtakes you all over again.<br/><br/>Why was it necessary that Burnham declare himself spiritually dead, and, hence, poetic justice that someone complete the picture he has of himself? This is the same kind of morbid nonsense some of us had to sit through when Mike Figgis and Nicolas Cage were indulging themselves in ""Leaving Las Vegas."" Actually, I know why.  It's a way of gathering sympathy for the main character and having a made-up tragedy wake up the other characters who despise him to change their minds about him.  It's so obviously manipulative and such raging self-pity, I can't believe so many people are buying this stuff.<br/><br/>This is a Dreamworks production which explains the supposedly happy male homosexual meighbors Jim and Jim, but they seem such a shallow depiction of suburban ideals that the goodwill feels like a backhanded compliment. They are just part of the problem that's burning Burnham's hambone.  And Chris Cooper whose performance could have been this movie's hallmark is thrown away for an ending that, if gays were really thinking about it, is not just a tired idea but a subtle insult.<br/><br/>It's Wes Bentley's guarded but unflinching gaze that's the real beauty. It surpasses even Ball's video conception of those fleeting moments when life holds you spellbound by its serendipity.  Of course, it doesn't hurt to have Conrad Hall behind the lens.  The man who capitalized on what most of his peers threw out outdoes even the most fastidious of them with some of the most fluid yet controlled camerawork in a movie released last year. Still, as good as it is, it doesn't take away from the dilapidated yarn this movie is weaving.  The story actually diminishes some of the visuals; and he might have garnered an Oscar, but director Sam Mendes didn't notice that he needed to rethink some of the plot and character development and presentation. The camera movements do get a little monotonous.  The only thing that didn't need rethinking is the score by Thomas Newman and others which plinks and plunks a seductive chord as it carries us gingerly through the course of the movie.  It almost makes you forget that the bloom on ""American Beauty"" has long fallen off the vine (The moment I noticed it was with Carolyn clipping roses as disinterestedly as Martha Stewart.) and that all you have to look forward to in it, if you reject the death wish lurking underneath it, is abject resignation to, as Lester might put it, our stupid little lives."

Alas, my first instincts had been correct, even more so than anticipated.<br/><br/>It probably goes without saying that Kevin Spacey was superb; he always is. And Wes Bentley was exceptional as his character walked the fine line between his own reality and his father's. But that's where the praise ends for me and the incredulity at having been duped by the Hollywood publicity machine begins.<br/><br/>For those who spout that this 2-hour waste of celluloid has deep meaning, I would ask for just a shallow explanation. The whole thing was a jumble of scenes and ideas going off at tangents. The bag blowing in the wind and the speech that accompanied its viewing were where I almost turned the VCR off, but I foolishly thought to myself, ""Well, it won for Best Picture. Surely something's gonna happen to tie this all together."" I was sadly mistaken.<br/><br/>And when Spacey's dead character reiterates at the end (while again hammering us with the plastic bag) that there's beauty all around if you only look, I felt the bile rise in my throat. He was killed, I'm not sure why (I especially didn't understand the killer's motivation in view of the scene in the garage just a few minutes prior) but finds beauty in the world -- in everything, for that matter. It was meaningless to me and, I'm sure, to a lot of other poor saps who wanted to believe the hype.<br/><br/>One final note: I was a die-hard Quantum Leap fan -- I have every episode on tape -- but I'm really tired of seeing Scott Bakula still playing Sam Beckett all these years later, here as a gay next-door neighbor of, again, absolutely no consequence to the movie."

I got to see this film on Sept 8 at a preview showing for ""college-age adults"" (though I'm a bit older) at the Mann Bruin.  The film itself is the best I have seen this year - a drama with humor, excellent acting, an untouchable script, a the capability to leave its audience in thought about life issues that we should reflect on more often.  The director, producers, and four of the main actors (everyone except Annette Bening) took questions afterwards (most of which were quite disappointing non-questions and star-induced, voice-quavering pleas for autographs or hugs).  The entire audience was quite animated throughout, clapped enormously at the end, and enjoyed themselves tremendously.  I think audiences across the world are going to find themselves clapping at the end of this film - something we desperately need more of from Hollywood.  <br/><br/>Also note, (a) the producers mentioned that they made this film for approx $15 million dollars - quite an accomplishment, and (b) this is Mr. Mendes' first film directing effort - he will be deservably lauded for this work. <br/><br/>

You might as well know that this is also the high point of the movie; it too is all downhill from here.  If that's good enough for you, go for it; otherwise, save your time and money.<br/><br/>The movie includes just about every mean stereotype of the American middle class that can be crammed into it.  The protagonist has a dull job he hates and eventually quits -- not to find something better (he doesn't try), but to pump iron, at least partly to impress the sexpot high-school girl friend of his daughter that he has the hots for; the girl thinks his attentions are cute.  The daughter herself is a sullen specimen who decides she likes the weird boy next boy even though her introduction to him is catching him sneaking Peeping Tom video of her.  The boy's father is an ex-Marine who embodies in extreme form of every Hollywood anti-military prejudice: a gun nut abusive to his son, totally oppressive to his a wife, and worse things I can't reveal without violating IMDb's ""no spoiler"" rule.  The protagonist's wife is a brittle sort who sells real estate; she works frantically to fix up a house and then has hysterics when it doesn't sell the first day (I've dealt with many real estate agents recently; none remotely resembled this woman).  And so forth.<br/><br/>Many critics loved this movie because this really is their image of America, which says a lot more about what's wrong with Hollywood than it does about America.  As for the rest of us -- I went with my wife and another couple and, when we emerged from the theater, my wife said 'Well, that was different.'  I said 'Yeah, different from entertainment!'

","This magnificent masterpiece of filmmaking is well deserving of the Oscar it earned.  The blending of the classic, stage-like dialogue and the set and camera tricks typical of the medium of film left me awestruck and wanting more.  The acting was superb: Kevin Spacey, Annette Benning, and Mena Suvari were three outstanding actors, in a cast all deserving of recognition.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey's character, Lester Burnham, should identify with every cubicle dweller that has ever had a crappy, stressful job.  His transition from a boring, comatose automaton to The Man, the personification of the life that every male baby boomer wishes they had, was interesting to watch, and you cannot help but cheer for his self-empowerment and -discovery.<br/><br/>Annette Benning, Carolyn Burnham, is the antithesis to Kevin Spacey's character.  She's a cold, heartless bitch, who cares more about money and power than living.  The interaction between the two, Lester and Carolyn is impeccably well written, and scares this college student in the level of death present in middle age.<br/><br/>Mena Suvari.  Ah, Mena Suvari. Her character, Angela Hayes, is the love interest of Lester Burnham.  You can't help but lust after the beauty of Suvari.  Her character is quite interesting to observe, especially once the shell of popularity and success is scaled away.<br/><br/>The music was impeccable; the use of The Guess Who was brilliant, and the scene with Annie Lennox in the background was mind-blowing (if you have seen the movie you will know which one I'm talking about).

","I saw this movie at a screening in Los Angeles on 9/8/99.  The director and stars were available for half an hour after the movie for a Q&A session. One thing that I found interesting was that the movie's budget according to the director was only $15 million.  (That, and the plastic bag scene was filmed by the director with his own home video camera in a parking lot somewhere in L.A. - by himself!)<br/><br/>Although this movie has a lot of humourous moments and scenes that are obviously designed to make the viewer laugh, it is first and foremost a drama.  Artistically filmed (sometimes with characters looking directly at the viewer and narration giving plot points away) this film is very unique. <br/><br/>
It truly takes the viewer into the lives of its characters.  There is more character development in this movie than in most any other movie you have probably seen.  <br/><br/>Annette Bening portrays her character perfectly.  Her acting is, as usual, superb - but the character really isn't too meaty.  Mena Suvari and Thora Birch play their roles perfectly, also.  We truly grow and learn about life through Kevin Spacey's character's eyes.  <br/><br/>The true surprise, for me anyway, was Wes Bentley.  The audience is taught to see beauty through his character.  If you thought you knew what beauty was - or how to live life - then you will learn again.  Everybody, I hope, has felt what the character Ricky has felt (the pure joy of witnessing raw beauty) - but he describes it in words and shows you with expressions so that his wonder at true beauty is a visual representation of what you know to have felt inside you.  <br/><br/>You will walk away from this movie touched inside.

Not to mention the performances which are nothing less than impeccable, especially Kevin Spacey who thoroughly deserved his Best Actor Oscar.

","Late 1990s film about an upper middle class U.S. street that makes Coronation Street look like Sesame Street with its secrets and frustrations!<br/><br/>You also have an Oscar winning Best Actor performance from controversial Kevin Spacey but let's consider the film itself.<br/><br/>Spacey plays 42 year old Lester Burnham. He seems to be suffering from a mid-life crisis on that he is in a loveless marriage to Carolyn (Annette Bening), with one child who is at the puberty age, Jane (Thora Birch). Carolyn herself is an estate agent. Not a particularly successful one at that who faces 'competition' in the business from Buddy Kane (Peter Gallacher?).<br/><br/>Lester has some going through the motions job in media. It contributes to the mortgage repayments kind of thing. Anyway his company is trying to make workforce cutbacks and he has to try and justify his employment.<br/><br/>To the right of his house are a gay couple both called Jim. To the left is an ex-U.S. Marine Colonel Fitts (Chris Cooper) with a 'secret' that is revealed in the film who has a controlling nature over his son, Ricky Fitts.<br/><br/>Ricky is a dope dealer in his spare time (as you do) as well as having a strange/deranged habit of filming Jane through the windows, sometimes in private situations.<br/><br/>Jane has a 'best' friend. A blonde, model-aspiring, good looking school friend of a character called Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari).<br/><br/>That just about provides the ambience of the neighbourhood! The film shows 42 year old Lester (scary) develop a crush on Angela. Going on a keep-fit regime and developing a dope habit in the process. Also developing a new found confidence by telling his employers a few home truths hence losing his job, buying an old car and 'bashing the bishop' in bed next to his wife!<br/><br/>Director Sam Mendes is probably more well known to audiences for his James Bond film collaborations Skyfall and Spectre but this his perhaps his career peak film.<br/><br/>Watching the strange interaction between the characters develop and their messed up lives. The film develops into a shocking ending which I won't spoil but it is not what you expect!<br/><br/>Spacey rightly or wrongly won the Oscar and at this time is probably his best performance aside The Usual Suspects from 1995. If you have not seen this film, I strongly recommend."

"hunter-friesen","6","1","3","10 April 2018"," An overrated tale about middle class America that is only held together by Kevin Spacey's performance
","1999 must have been a time to rebel against the system. Both Fight Club and American Beauty came out to great acclaim and have gained a cult following since. Their message of toppling society and pointing out all its wrongs had great appeal during a time when consumerism was at its peak. In my mind, American Beauty fairs just slightly better than Fight Club, but don't consider that a compliment. Even though Kevin Spacey gives an astounding performance that deservedly got him an Oscar, the rest of the crew fail to live up to expectations and surprisingly were still rewarded for it with another four Oscars, including Best Picture. <br/><br/>Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a weak, depressed man. He lives in his upper-class suburban home with his perfectionist wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), and teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch). None of the three really love the other, they just go about their days tolerating each other just enough to live under one roof. One day Lester cracks, he quits his office job and starts saying whatever he wants. He also starts trying to get with his daughter's cheerleading friend, Angela (Mena Suvari), who is one of the most beautiful girls at school. These actions alienate Lester from his family and the world, but he doesn't seem to care, he's having the time of his life. <br/><br/>American Beauty tries to be something special with its message about materialism and the wrongs of society, but it never fully captures that idea, mostly it just dances around it from time to time. It also doesn't help that some of the actions Lester does are very hypocritical against the whole message of the film. In one instance, Lester complains about how Carolyn values the couch so much, even though in the same scene he talks about how much joy he got from buying his dream car. <br/><br/>One of my biggest pet peeves in films is when crucial plot points happen because of wild circumstances and coincidences. This film has a couple of those, and some of them are so big it starts to get unbelievable by the end. The whole ending of the film rests on one scene where one character says on the others, but their vision is disoriented so they don't get the full understanding of what is actually going on. <br/><br/>The handling of the characters is also rather poor. Lester's final outcome does come as a surprise, but once you think about it feels very wrong. He finally gets his resolution at the end but is not allowed to act on what he has learned. It's another detriment to the message because the film had been building up Lester's journey and completely throws it away in the end. <br/><br/>American Beauty is an actor's showcase, but only for one person; Kevin Spacey. Everyone else plays second fiddle and does lesser work than him. Spacey has the boring look and intelligence to perfectly play a man who knows exactly every wild thing he's doing. He symbolizes the man in a mid-life crisis, one that just wants to let go and find himself again.<br/><br/>Annette Bening loses herself as the uptight housewife, but for all the wrong reasons. She's over the top and slightly cartoonish. She tries to replicate Spacey and be a female symbol for America but ends up coming off too artificial.<br/><br/>Thora Birch and Wes Bentley do a middling job as Jane and Ricky, two teens who engage in an increasingly strange relationship. They both carry themselves flat and don't ever really react to anything around them.<br/><br/>If it was up to me, the 2000 Oscars ceremony should go down in infamy for giving the Best Picture award to the weakest of the nominees. The Academy can't help but reward the film with the most social commentary, even if it is slightly hypocritical. Except for Kevin Spacey's performance, there's not much else to pull you into this film or think kindly of it after it's done."

","Kevin Spacey, for me, remains the most memorable thing about American BEAUTY. He has all the best lines, his character is the most interesting, and his midlife rebellion is genuinely funny. But that revolt is only the first half of the film. This movie isn't nearly the bastion of depth that it was when I was nineteen. The angst and twisted side of suburbia feels fake, on the nose. And that triteness is at its worst when we delve into Ricky's subplot. The flying bag is where the movie teeters on insufferable.

","American Beauty is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast.When I first heard about this movie it sounded very basic,a father goes through a mid-life crisis,a subject many films and television series have focused on before,but American Beauty does it in a very different way,we are taken inside the mind of Lester Burnham,we can see exactly what dark thoughts go through his mind and how his passion for his daughters friend develops.Kevin Spacey delivers a truly magnificent performance,he really became this character and put himself in to his shoes in order to truly understand what this man was going through so he could deliver a convincing act,and he went on to win his second Academy Award,and I would say he deserved this even more than his win for Usual Suspects.I liked that the movie didn't just revolve around Lester,we also get to see how the different man he is becoming is affecting his wife and daughter,we get to see how they are changing as well in very dark and negative ways.I feel like everyone can relate to these characters in a way,obviously not as extreme as them,but we have all had times when we craved more excitement than our life delivers,and I think that this is why Lester is such a captivating character,because despite not wanting to,we can definitely relate to him to a certain degree.Dark and somewhat twisted,I would definitely recommend American Beauty to anyone looking for a good drama. <br/><br/>A father becomes disillusioned and begins to hunger more excitement in his life.<br/><br/>Best Performance: Kevin Spacey Worst Performance: Peter Gallagher"
"jimbo-53-186511","5","1","3","20 June 2014"," I had mixed feelings about this film
","If I'm being totally honest, I was considering stopping watching American Beauty at about the 60 minute mark. I felt that the first half of the film struggled to make any sort of point. It just seemed to wander and meander from one creepy scene to another.<br/><br/>I'll admit that the concept of a much older man suffering a mid life crisis and trying to score with a much younger women (or girl) in this case makes for an interesting social commentary - it is also a believable premise. The problem is that the writers seem to forget at the start of the film what point they are trying to make? I'll admit that some of Spacey's characters scenes where he was trying to get buff to impress Angela were quite funny. One failing of this film is in its lack of subtlety; some moments had me cringing - the slanging match between Carolyn and Lester at the second dinner table scene was particularly bad (in fact I could go as far to say that it was laughably bad). It had all the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the face). The masturbation scene when Lester is thinking about Angela was probably meant to make a rather unsubtle point that there is a major failing in their marriage, but the fact that Lester openly admits to masturbating once a day means that this scene loses the impact that it intended to make.<br/><br/>Far and away, the most interesting character in this film was Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley). He comes across as creepy and weird, but Jane sees something in him. It soon becomes clear that Jane and Ricky are sort of kindred spirits and Ricky is quick to see Angela for what she really is.<br/><br/>I've mentioned that the first half of the film was somewhat slow and ponderous. The second half was much better. The second half of the film has a darker edge to it and it finally seemed like the film was starting to make an attempt at social commentary. The character plot twists admittedly were somewhat predictable, I still liked the way that many of the characters became sort of an 'anti-cliche' in the end.<br/><br/>This is a tough one for me as the film does have a mix of good and bad. If the first half of the film had been as good as the second half then I would have enjoyed it a lot more, but the lack of focus and general cringe inducing first half meant it wasn't an easy ride getting to the much more enjoyable second half. I'm on the fence on this one. There is good and bad in equal measures."

Their teenage daughter Jane is constantly depressed, lacking in self-esteem, and convinced that she's unattractive. Her problems aren't helped by her best friend Angela, an aspiring model who is quite beautiful and believes that that alone makes her a worthwhile person. Jane isn't the only one who has noticed that Angela is attractive: Lester has fallen into uncontrollable lust for her, and she becomes part of his drastic plan to change his body and change his life.

"todd_4560","10","1","3","3 August 2011"," The movie that made me re-think who I am....
","Single-handedly one of the most compelling films ever made. Anyone who was seen the trailer of this movie wouldn't have even thought about watching this as its just so under quality compared to this masterpiece of a movie. It is just the life of every seemingly haapy and perfect suburban household with a regular dorky dad, an over competitive mom who wants everything to be perfect at any cost, a confused kid and weird neighbors who smile at you every morning as if it is their duty to do so. Nearly everyone in the world can connect to this. But ""look closer"" (as said in the trailer) and you will see their sadness, tears, pain, suffering, pressure, frustration etc etc. But this movie is so much more than seeing and relating to pain, it is about seeing into the beauty of the world through all the pain, seeing light at the end of the tunnel, seeing a guiding star in a clouded sky if u will. That one moment when you do re-discover yourself is when everything seems to fall in place, even if only for a second, that feeling will last forever. <br/><br/>Kevin Spacey fits into the role of Lester as if he just put on his pajamas and going to bed. He seems so natural and lovable in the role. I will say that it is the one role which will define him and his career for ages to come. He does so well to mix up that element of comic relief in the serious undertone which carries the movie. His bored and uninterested voice actually is an upside which actually makes you understand and connect to him in a better way. You are invited into his neighborhood, his street and his life without even trying. No matter how much you want to leave it, it never lets you go. The supporting cast consisting of Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari and Chris Cooper revolve so well around this so closely knit story-line. Everyone of them is extremely believable in their respective roles and show you the dark underbelly of suburban living which is so rarely spotted by the suburban people themselves. <br/><br/>Director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball deserve their Oscar and the special praise they get. Their treatment of characters and the whole premise of the film is splendid. Yes, the movie is a comedy drama but only because the situations created in the story are so well worked out and thought about. When a black comedy is being written special care has to be taken so that the movie does not become preachy and boring. No worries about that here. You will take away a message from this movie but not how you thin you will though. You'll understand what I'm talking about eventually. Kudos to both of the fine gentlemen behind the screen who made this movie one of the most memorable two hours of my life.<br/><br/>To a superb script, shockingly truthful direction, Kevin Spacey and his ""perfect"" family, the Oscars finally getting it right and to what you'll take away after watching this movie I give it a 10/10."

","American Beauty is a movie that you either love it or hate it. Understand it or do not understand it. This movie depicts numerous meanings. One of the primary principles that the movie portrays is the absolute value of the significance of life. The movie reflects the lives of American families residing in a suburban neighborhood. Although the neighborhood appearance from the outside appears to be the genre of ""picture perfect"" the families are intangibly dealing with an array of predicaments. This movie harness countless emotions and subjects i.e. infidelities, homosexuality, confrontation, shame, bulling, confinement, lust, sadness, happiness, uncertainty, and death. The theme of the film is ""enjoy life to its fullest"" live everyday like it is your last, stop viewing the glass of life as half-full.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie each contribute significant positions throughout the film. Lester Burnham (played by Kevin Spacey) is a disheartened physically and emotionally detached working man, father, and husband dealing with the complacency's of his life. He willfully transcends upon a different outlook on life when he see his daughter Jane Burnham (played by Thora Birch) friend Angela Hayes (played by Suvari) practicing her cheer-leading routine and develops a lustful correlation toward her. He begins to embark on a newness of life. He decides he does no longer want to be a pretender and becomes less pasty, but becomes courageous adventurous. His wife Carolyn Burnham (played by Annette Bening) cannot quite understand his transformation, thus going through her own emotional hang-ups. She has adulterous affair, blames Lester, and then represents herself as the wounded.<br/><br/>The films characters mesh well; philosophically paralleling key components of their lives. The chemistry was wonderfully construed. The lighting of the scenes correlated to the plot throughout each scene. This movie is conformed from a narrative approach and set its own pace. The movies also, embellished a symbolic approach by incorporating red roses sporadically emerging in the scenes of the film. During which the roses represented different meaning when they appear. When the roses appear in the scene with Carolyn its represent unresponsiveness, dry, and incoherent, with Angela its represents angelic, sensuality, lust, and sexuality, with Lester is presume the position of boredom, emptiness, and disconnect. American Beauty is a great movie that offers tranquility, humor, laughter, and morality; all in which interlink with movies theme. There are many twists and turns in this movie and with each twist a lesson is uncovered."

","American Beauty is a 1999 drama starring Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham, Thora Birch as Jane Burnham, and Mena Suvari as Angela Hayes. Lester, his daughter Jane, and his wife Carolyn seem to be a normal happy family to everyone on the outside. They have good jobs, and live in a nice house in nice neighborhood. However, on the inside Lester has become depressed, and with no help from his family who seems to hate him, he continues to fall into a deeper depression. Carolyn is obsessed with her job and materialistic things, and has a budding relationship with a rival real estate agent. Jane is a typical hormonal teenager, and begins a relationship with Ricky Fits, the new neighbor boy who is a drug dealer with a very strict and homophobic marine father. At a basketball game, Lester meets his daughter's friend Angela, and instantly becomes infatuated with her. After this meeting, the movie takes a twist and Lester starts making drastic changes in his life. Some of these changes seem good for him, but not everyone else agrees.<br/><br/>The best theme for this movie would be happiness. It is wanted by every character in this movie, they all just want it in a different way. Carolyn believed that to be successful you had to pretend to be happy on the outside, so she expected Lester and Jane to act the same way. This way of thinking didn't carry on throughout the whole movie, because when Lester made the changes in his life he made sure his family and everyone else knew it, he refused to be bullied by his wife and daughter, and made sure they understood that. He was the only character in this movie that did what he had to do to make himself happy. Keeping on track with this theme, a movie similar to American Beauty would be Fight Club. The main character in both movies is a depressed man who hates his life and mostly everything in it. Both characters make drastic changes, including quitting their job, to try to find happiness. You could say that both Lester and Edward Norton's character in Fight Club are a bit crazy.<br/><br/>Two film techniques that help support this theme in American Beauty would be music, and motifs. Throughout most of the movie whenever Lester is seeing Angela either in person or in his dreams there is music playing in the background, most of the time this music sounds whimsical and grabs the viewer's attention. We notice that every time Lester sees Angela he seems happier. Another technique used is motifs. Throughout the movie the same ""idea"" of Angela is shown in Lester's mind, a sort of sexual fantasy. He is usually shown smiling happily whenever he is having these ""ideas."" Also, there are always rose petals in these scenes, another pattern used throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>To me, this whole movie is about trying to find happiness. It just shows that people go about it in different ways. Some people are completely fine living an unhappy life as long as they seem successful to everyone else on the outside. While some people will do whatever it takes to find happiness, even if this means turning their life upside down."

His wife Carolyn, played by Annette Bening, is hell on wheels and self-absorbed. Lester is in the middle of a mid life crises and after meeting one of his daughter Jane's (Thora Birch) friends Angela he is rejuvenated. Angela, played by Mena Suvari, provokes a sexual spark within Lester that he simply cannot shake. Lester finds out that his wife Carolyn is having and affair and after hearing he is going to be laid off he black mails his boss for $60,000 and quits. Lester starts to reinvent himself to impress Angela and starts to improve his appearance and buys his dream car. <br/><br/>We see new friendships forming between Lester and Ricky, the neighbor Colonel Fitt's son, which Colonel Fitt's (Chris Cooper) later interprets as being a homosexual relationship. Jane and Ricky become involved and Lester and Angela's relationship progresses. The theme of appearance versus reality presents itself many times. Another film that conveys this theme is Shutter Island. Lester seems to have the perfect life but it is far from that. Angela seems to have everything looks can offer but is unhappy with her appearance. We also later find out about Colonel Fitt's being ""in the closet."" The movie ends in a shocking was with Lester being shot and killed. Ironically, the moment he dies is the moment he finds true happiness in his life. The film leaves us hanging on who killed Lester being torn between the two suspects Colonel Fitt's and Carolyn. The motif that appears in the movie is the red rose petals that appear when Lester fantasizes about Angela, as well as the roses in Carolyn's garden. This symbolizes the perfect life. This is directly related to the theme because most of the characters are striving for a kind of perfection that is lacking from their lives. Another important technique used in the film was angel. One scene where this is used is when the Brenham family is seated at the dinner table, Lester is on one end of the table and Carolyn is on the other. Although the family seems to just be having a nice family meal the distance between them represents the distance between them in their marriage. American Beauty was probably one of the best films I have ever seen and the theme of appearance versus reality is something everyone can relate to."

","This is my review on American beauty.Let me by start by first saying this is one of my favorite movies.The story line is fantastic followed by outstanding performances by the cast.<br/><br/>This movie is about a man (kevin spacey) who lives with his daughter and wife in a suburban area. He lives without purpose and is no way happy with his life. He soons discovers that he does not have to live his life in the unfofilling way that he has been. When new neighbors move in his life changes completely. <br/><br/>Everything about this movie is amazing. The direction, the acting, screenplay, script. If you like a drama/dark comedy with a solid script and amazing performances this one is definitely for you."

","On the surface, this is a harsh but moving film. Characters reclaiming their lives from the dregs of suburban life. However, as we've been told, you must look closer to truly appreciate this film. I'm not going to give anything away, but see this film. Be warned, though, this is not 'Santa Claus meets the Smurfs'. This film takes time to appreciate, but is worth it in the end. I believe this film can give people a better perception of modern day life, but you must be willing to sit down and think. The acting is phenomenal, but that just pulls you deeper into this strange and compelling story. Please watch this movie. It might just make you a better person, and you'll definitely feel the need to look closer into everyday life and American Beauty in the real world. In summary: a modern masterpiece."

","I'll will go ahead and say that I think there a lot of films out there (not just films but books as well) that I perceive as being ""faux"" deep. American Beauty is just this kind of film. The premise I thought to be a pretty typical premise, the main theme I thought to be a pretty typical main theme, the characters and acting I thought to be pretty typical. In the end though, the thing that turned me away from it was the execution. I just thought everything about this movie was soooo cookie cutter. For example, we took a break in the middle of the movie (I was watching it with friends) and they all started to talk about how cool it was that the main character smoked weed and was an adult. I rolled my eyes because that is the kind of hip bullcrap that directors and writers put in movies to sell to audiences. My final assessment of the movie was that it was Office Space, but without the comedy. Before people think that I am crazy I will explain this theory. So the main character goes through a religious style experience that shows him he should stop living life by other people's rules. It goes well for a while, but then it starts to alienate the man from his wife/girlfriend and drives her away. He ends up really hurting his best friends/neighbors and daughter. Then at the end of the movie the main character realizes that this lifestyle he has been leading really has no substance and that everything that he had before that lifestyle got out of hand is what gave his life substance. Of course, Office Space has a happy ending and American Beauty really doesn't, but the main theme is the exact or close to the exact same thing. Except American Beauty has not comedy..."

","The film is about some American families with their own problems and the reflections to out of their houses, for me there is nothing to re-watch the DVD except one of the greatest love scenes i have ever seen in a film, the scene where the boy showed the girl the best film he ever made, a nylon bag dancing in the air trying to obey what the wind says, together with leaves, minutes before the snow as he says... the characters are extremely different and does not fit to usual life, (if any, its very rare), no music, no effects, no action, no any memorable and effective quotes, yet its a good film for one time. For me the good film needs to be watched again and again, i did not get this feeling in this film, despite Kevin Spacey and Wes Bentley's perfect performance, but the nylon bag scene is ""forever"" and something different. i liked that scene so much that i had a break in the middle of the film watching the same scene a couple of times.. watch it, but don't expect big things just because it won the Oscar..."

","So! What's all the fuss about? I was very disappointed with this highly touted offering from director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball.<br/><br/>To be fair, the film does focus well on some of our worst human frailties, and a few scenes are disturbingly close to home. Having said this, I find it hard to call the disintegration of the family unit entertainment, let alone black comedy.<br/><br/>I am a huge Kevin Spacey fan, yet I could not take to him in this film. Either the role and he were mismatched, or he is only at his best in support roles. Annette Bening is at her marvellous best as the obsessive Carolyn, and Thora Birch is a major talent on the threshold as the frustrated teenager Jane. Mena Suvari, Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, Peter Gallagher, Sam Robards and Scott Bakula also star. Thomas Newman produces a familiar theme.<br/><br/>What a shame this film lost the plot so badly after a promising, thematic beginning.<br/><br/>Friday, January 28, 2000 - Village Century City Walk"

","I had heard nothing but good things about this movie, so I felt inclined to watch this film. It met and exceeded my expectations. Kevin Spacey makes probably his best performance, even with all the rest of his classic performances. The supporting cast did a bang-up job as well, although Spacey carried the film.<br/><br/>This film centers around Lester Burnham (Best Actor Kevin Spacey), who is a suburban father and husband. He and his family seem like your typical American family. Then, Lester starts to go through somewhat of a mid-life crisis. He decides that he is going to quit his job, start lifting weights, and start hitting on one of his daughter's teenage friends. After Lester finds out that his wife is cheating on him with another man, he kind of takes that as a last straw. He stops caring about almost every aspect of his life. Lester gains the friendship of a teenage boy that lives across the street named Ricky Fits. They somehow relate to each other, and Ricky starts to spend a lot of time at the Burnham household. Ricky's intolerant, ex-Marine father automatically assumes that Ricky and Lester are having a homosexual relationship. At the end, Ricky's father has had enough of Lester, so he goes over to his house and shoots him in the head. Lester's death ended the movie.<br/><br/>This film truly is a must-see. It was definitely worthy of the Best Picture Oscar for 1999. GO RENT THIS FILM OR SOMETHING!!! 10/10 STARS"

","Looking back years later, while American Beauty was a pretty good film, the Sixth Sense, M. Night Shamalan, and particularly Haley Joel Osment were quite simply robbed (by the ""Academy""). Comparing the two for picture and performance, the Sixth Sense was phenomenal in comparison. Direction was intelligent, and Osment was simply brilliant. It spoils the credibility of the Oscar - which I wonder if they realize - or more importantly, if they even care. Unfortunately, this will continue because the insider ""agendas"" will always reign supreme. <br/><br/>I find it interesting that when trying to submit a review for any film, IMDb requires that you must include a minimum sized review for it to be accepted. This will only prevent people from being succinct in their opinion (which is a bit silly). At any rate, Kevin Spacey's performance as a middle-aged man in crisis was very well done, but Osment's performance was nothing short of brilliant. There is a difference."

Who ever said that cheap movies can't be great!?! My girlfriend and I started out with a infomercial of a dirty old man selling sex toys on an obscure TV station which was a hysterical warm up to the actual movie.<br/><br/>The story begins where a man who was too honest for the advertising industry and looses his job.

He quickly passes away then he finds himself in heaven surrounded by a beautiful angel (Mena Suvari). He is finally content. But heaven has its problems where God, who turns out to be an idiot (Chris Cooper) tries to kiss Kevin Spacey in his garage even though he isn't gay. God apparently does not follow Spacey and knows nothing of the situation. So he sends this poor soul back to earth to fight the ""devils"".<br/><br/>Heaven does not seem to be well versed in details such as preservation of a new body. Therefore the arch angel informs this man that he has to smoke lots of pot to prevent the decaying process. We then have a decaying corpse without funds that will do anything to get his pot.<br/><br/>I will just stop there as not to spoil the rest of this gem but I HIGHLY recommend it.<br/><br/>Enjoy."

American Beauty is one of the few films that gives every element, including drama, romance, comedy, and suspense. The acting performances of Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, and even the supporting roles of Thora Birch and Wes Bentley were absolutely astounding. This is a film that cannot be overlooked for any movie fan. Spacey gives a dynamite performance that displays just how powerful one actor can be. Flawless in every aspect of the word.

This film truly made me question a lot of things about my life.<br/><br/>Performances from the actors themselves are just brilliant. Kevin Spacy truly embodies the American male and Wes Bently performance I think was strangely cold and flat but funnily enough that was what character needed in the actors performance.<br/><br/>Without a doubt the best performance in the entire film is from Annette Bening. Not that Hilary Swanks performance in boys don't cry wasn't good but i think Annette should have stolen the Oscar away from her. She well deserved it.

"Aldri7","3","1","3","8 March 2006"," way overrated
","I have seldom had as much trouble watching and liking a movie as I had with ""American Beauty"". Recently I bought the DVD due to the film's excellent reputation, then sat down with eager anticipation to watch. But about half way through, I turned it off. If the ending was brilliant, then I guess I made a mistake (and my apologies for reviewing a movie I did not watch all the way through)<br/><br/>OK, so is this a serious, arty film, or parody? I never did figure it out. Excellent music in the beginning helped lead me to believe it was more of an arty film, and through an early scene in the gymnasium, I was doing OK. But then things started to go steadily downhill. <br/><br/>First there is the disastrous relationship, which defies any logic, between Kevin Spacey's character and his wife. If you liked ""Raging Bull"" (I didn't), this relationship is for you. Because the two are at each other's throats from the very onset of the movie, one never actually gets a chance to find out what started it all. Sure they are politically mismatched, but we are also expected to believe they are sexually mismatched as well, something that was not so easy for me to understand. But at any rate, I guess we're expected to just swallow it all and believe..<br/><br/>Soon after, we are introduced to an odd assortment of characters, some conservative and some liberal. Its obvious who the director favors, and I have no problem with his bias as I am not as fond of cheerleaders and military men as I am of arty types either. But did we really need to get hit over the head with such crude stereotypes? Ever hear of subtlety? Now suddenly the arty film is beginning to look more like a National Lampoon parody. Not only is the cheerleader a LITTLE slutty, for example, but she is the MOST slutty cheerleader you have ever seen. I guess I'd just rather this be more implied than forced down my throat. And so it went with the other characters as well. Now I'm starting to lose interest in the movie....<br/><br/>...but then the moment came when I suddenly realized what this movie was REALLY about - an autobiographical tale about a young filmmaker, presumably the writer or director himself, at a young age. This becomes apparent when you see how much sensitivity and depth is given to the characters Ricky Fits and Judy Burnham as their relationship progresses. Yes, it was touching at times and well done.<br/><br/>But I guess its just not what I expected to see nor why I bought the DVD. The socio-political message of a suburban family gone berserk, of alienation, of ""normal"" and ""crazy"" getting reversed - this is not exactly a new theme. This has been the stuff of Hollywood in one form or another for decades, and its no wonder as it's there that all those ""crazy, alienated"" creative people eventually end up. Watch any M*A*S*H episode and you will see cheerleaders and military men trashed, suburban lifestyles (Frank Burns) mocked, and sensitive (or crazy) souls deified. This is profound and new? And so since none of this surprised me or caused me think deep thoughts, I was mainly left to wonder what else the film had to offer besides good music.<br/><br/>Maybe I just didn't wait long enough to find out, but then again I just couldn't handle all the screaming nor the ""no holds barred"" approach which often made it come across more like crass parody than important film-making. And as for the glowing reviews to be found elswhere at IMDb? - I think the authors are just as deluded that they are being profound as the director of this film was."

Though she is playing the Ultimate Suburban Wife she does get a couple of sympathetic moments.<br/><br/>The teens are completely believable and captivating, often with very little dialog, though I nearly gagged on the Lolita element, as I have strong feelings about that boundary.<br/><br/>The cinematography is beautiful, moving seamlessly from suburban idyll to dream sequences to video watching (with lots of symbolism about watching vs. participating). <br/><br/>The parents' music was chosen very well and is integral to the story line, though I don't think the kids' got to be represented audio-wise to contrast with the classic rock that symbolized living in the past.<br/><br/>(originally written 9/26/1999)"

","A celebration for Hollywood, I must admit. They usually trash out any old rubbish these days but this is one of those which hides away from the 'typical' everyday movie and shows us a whole new thinking to life.<br/><br/>First of all, let me just talk about the acting in this movie. The whole direction side of the movie is second to none. Just brilliant. Every little scene is mastered to perfection. The 5 Oscar's speak for themselves (even though I'm not too fond of the whole Oscar system). Kevin Spacey is officially 'THE MAN'. His acting deserved 10 Oscar's alone.<br/><br/>This movie is beautiful. It teaches us there is more to life than what seems. Never jump to conclusions. Never become depressed too easily. ever give up. Never give in. Never be mad. There is so much Beauty in the world. It's true. It may actually sound stupid, ""There is so much Beauty in the world?"" Like what you may ask? A paper bag floating around? What on earth is so beautiful about that? Well, I don't know, I DO KNOW but some things are best left unsaid. And 'THAT' is what Beauty is in my eyes. The silence...""Silence speaks a thousand words"". Silence is beauty. It's the most powerful weapon you could EVER have! In any situation...stay quiet...because if it's meant in you're destiny...it'll happen for you.<br/><br/>After watching this for the first time I was shocked. Not because it was good. No, because it was the most appalling movie i'd ever seen. I had thought to myself, what a waste of time! How did I let myself waste 2 hours of my brilliant little life on this crap? I didn't even understand it.<br/><br/>However, after giving it another chance on DVD (WITH subtitles) this time, as the ending came round, I was in awe of this cinematic masterpiece. I was in regret. I regretted it so badly, because I never 'LOOKED CLOSER'. I looked at it like any other movie. A sad little story about a pathetic little loser named ""LESTER"". That's what it is. We only see things how we'd like to see them. We only see things our eyes want us to see. We never ever LOOK CLOSER at anything. <br/><br/>You have to watch it for yourselves but anybody could relate to this movie. It's simply brilliant. Please don't knock it after one viewing. Watch it over and over again (if you have enough time!) and I can guarantee you will come to love this movie and appreciate it like no other.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say it's my best of all time, because it certainly isn't but it's in my top 5. It's give me a whole new base to life and helps me in the thinking of others.<br/><br/>We must not judge a book by it's cover. That is the worst thing to do. After watching this, I took a look at my life and realised how many things in American Beauty I could relate to. It's like I feel regret, because I never saw this earlier. If I had seen this earlier in my life I would have been brought up in a whole new manner.<br/><br/>For all the people who haven't seen the movie YET, ""You have no idea what i'm talking about.

"JamesHitchcock","10","1","3","8 April 2004"," A Suburban Masterpiece
","The opening and closing scenes of `American Beauty' are narrated from beyond the grave by the ghost of the recently deceased Lester Burnham. The rest of the film shows the story of the last few months of his life.  On the face of things, he is living the American dream as a fully paid-up member of the middle class. He has a career in advertising, a large house in a well-to-do suburb, an attractive wife who has a successful career in her own right as an estate agent, and a pretty teenage daughter. Beneath the surface, however, Lester's life is falling apart. He is facing redundancy from his job, he is trapped in a loveless and sexless marriage and he feels alienated from his rebellious and difficult daughter.<br/><br/>Lester starts to question the values around which his life has been built and to behave in a seemingly eccentric manner. Deprived of both sex and affection by his increasingly self-absorbed wife Carolyn, he makes no secret of his sexual desires for Angela, his daughter's classmate and closest friend, and begins to work out in an attempt to make himself more attractive to her. He takes redundancy from his job after blackmailing his employers into giving him a generous settlement. In an attempt to recapture the happier days of his youth, he takes to smoking pot, buys an expensive sports car and gets a job in a fast-food joint. His relationship with Carolyn continues to deteriorate and she begins an affair with a rival in the real estate business.<br/><br/>Intertwined with Lester's story is that of his next-door neighbours, the Fittses, a family even more dysfunctional than the Burnhams. The father, Frank, a colonel in the Marines, is an authoritarian, bullying, control freak with a particular dislike of his own son, Ricky, whom he sees as insufficiently manly and suspects of homosexuality- wrongly, because Ricky is in fact dating Lester's daughter, Jane.<br/><br/>One of the film's major themes is the need to enjoy life to the full and the realisation that this can only be done through emotional honesty. Lester comes to realise that he has become too preoccupied with his career and with financial success to appreciate the beauty and joy of living. Most of the other characters, however, are guilty of bad faith in that their lives are based on pretence or the suppression of aspects of their personality. The most obvious case is that of Frank, whose violent prejudice against gays stems from his own repressed homosexual nature. Carolyn, a carefree, unconventional and loving young woman in the early days of her marriage, is now obsessed with her business, her successful image and the code of `keeping up appearances' to the exclusion of all else. As a result, she has become cold, neurotic and sarcastic, and the love she once felt for Lester has died. Angela, despite her fear of seeming ordinary, is precisely that; she has the rather conventional ambition, for an attractive teenager, of becoming a model. Her boasting about her supposed sexual conquests and her desire to seduce Lester when she discovers his attraction to her are born out of her need to see herself as glamorous and seductive. When she breaks down and confesses that she is really still a virgin, she suddenly seems a more sympathetic character; a vulnerable girl rather than a sluttish young woman. Even Ricky, whom Lester envies because of his ability to take pleasure in the beauty of life, is guilty of hypocrisy. He condemns the materialism and immorality of suburban life, but his own lifestyle is based on an equally materialistic and even more immoral pursuit of wealth through dealing in cannabis.<br/><br/>To criticise the film as one which encourages immoral behaviour is, in fact, to miss the point. It is not saying that it is necessary to attempt to commit adultery with a teenage schoolgirl or to deal in drugs in order to achieve happiness. Similarly, the film is not demanding that one should share Ricky's idea that a plastic bag blowing in the wind represents some sort of aesthetic ideal; it simply suggests that we should ourselves look for beauty, however we define it, in our daily lives. None of the characters (except, perhaps, Lester after his death) are presented as having all the right answers to life's problems, so they should not be seen as role-models to be imitated. Lester and Ricky, however, are at least asking the right questions, whereas Frank and Carolyn do not even realise that there are questions to be asked.<br/><br/>Because the major characters have two sides to their personalities, an outer and an inner side, the film demands high standards of acting. All the players rise to that challenge. Kevin Spacey well deserved his Best Actor award for his portrayal of the middle-aged rebel Lester. Annette Bening played Carolyn as selfish and neurotic, but also showed occasional glimpses of the vivacity that attracted Lester to her in the first place. Chris Cooper is excellent as the brutal yet tormented Frank, as are Thora Birch as Jane, truculent and rebellious yet in need of affection, and Mena Suvari as Angela. The criticism has been made that some of the characters (particularly Carolyn and Frank) are exaggerated rather than entirely lifelike, but this is deliberate exaggeration for satirical effect.<br/><br/>The film has certain similarities in subject-matter with that excellent British television satire from the seventies, `The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin', which also dealt with a frustrated middle-class suburbanite facing a mid-life crisis. (I wonder if Sam Mendes was influenced by youthful memories of this programme). `American Beauty', however, is a complex film with many levels of meaning; more than just a social satire on the mores of suburbia, it is also a character study and a philosophical exploration of the search for happiness and the meaning of beauty. There are some memorable visual images, such as the vision of Angela in the bath of rose petals and even the notorious plastic bag. Sam Mendes joins that illustrious group of directors, such as Orson Welles with `Citizen Kane' and Sidney Lumet with `Twelve Angry Men', who have made a masterpiece with their first feature film. 10/10."
"paul2001sw-1","7","1","3","4 April 2004"," Sub-Lynchian
","Sam Mendes' 'American Beauty' is a fun satire on American suburban culture, but in my opinion it hardly deserved it's Oscars.  Potato-jowelled Kevin Spacey, in the lead role as a middle aged man undergoing a mid-life crisis, is very funny, his behaviour unreasonable yet appealing at the same time. But the symptoms of his crisis (lusting after his daughter's best friend, buying a fast car, etc.) are all quite unoriginal.  Annette Bening plays his ambitious, shallow wife (and there's a degree of misogyny in the way the film takes Spacey's side over hers, when coupled with its portrayal of Mena Suvari's teenage bitch): the other adult characters (the repressed bigot, the cheesy salesman) are similarly cliched. Fundamentally, this is quite a shallow film, albeit one that makes you laugh.<br/><br/>The younger characters are, if anything, even more problematic.  Mena Suvari plays Angela, the young sexpot for whom Spacey falls: her performance is poor, fluctuating wildly between tough girl front and inner vulnerability. What's interesting about real people is that we can be two things at the same time: but Angela goes from bad girl to good, and is never in between. The screenwriter also makes a common error in believing you make a character seem sexy by getting her to swear a lot; but Angela always seems forced and knowing, ironically (from the viewer's perspective) utterly failing to represent the combination of playfulness and naturalness in real teenagers which would offer an explanation for Spacey's lust.  Maybe this is even intentional cowardice on the part of the film-makers - it's safer by far to make a film about a middle aged man in love with a dream, than by one really attracted to an actual (younger) girl. By making Angela so clearly symbolic, they escape the risk of getting attacked by those hyper-sensitive to portrayals of paedophilia.<br/><br/>Thora Birch's character, Jane, is Spacey's daughter.  The film decides to largely exonerate her of responsibility in its wider farce: it mocks her mode of, like, speaking, but it caresses her more than it puts in the boot: her ludicrous desire for plastic surgery is, for example, hardly touched. Plus, as in all Hollywood movies, even the 'plain' girl in the plot is necessarily played by a beautiful actress.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Wes Bentley's character is another stock part: the weird kid who turns out to be all right; but not because weirdness is OK, but rather because he's not really weird after all. He may not be weird but he is a drug dealer, though presented in a wholly positive light as if morally uncorrupted by his criminal trade.  Even if one has no problems with cannabis use, it's strange that he is presented as a role model (in contrast to the suburban hypocrites) when his ability to make a fortune out of his work is obviously derived from that very hypocrisy (if drugs were legal, no-one would get rich selling them): but this film lacks the intelligence to see that he is a part of the picture (and not apart from it).  Also, his interest in filming things, reminding one of numerous other movies including 'Peeping Tom' and 'Sex, Lies and Videotape', helps the plot along but is one of those devices one suspects are of more interest to film-makers than to the general public.<br/><br/>The film ends by giving Spacey a moment of epiphany he has done nothing to earn (if he really had found meaning in his life through quitting the rat race, that would be different but all he has actually done is played out his fantasies without yet counting the consequences).  Indeed, it gets all solemn and meaningful in a long drawn out conclusion. <br/><br/>Overall I have been very hard on this film, which I actually enjoyed.  But fundamentally it is a very compromised satire, one that mocks its characters but forgives its audience, even though the two are really the same (and when a braver film would dare to do things the other way around). Anyone can laugh at unhappy families.  A real revolutionary would aim at the happy ones."

","I am shocked at the great reception American Beauty has gotten on the IMDB. #2, only behind the Godfather!?!? Come on! It was great, to be sure, but all of the film's sentiments have been expressed before, and better. The decaying family relationships were stated in the better film The Ice Storm. The idea that even in terrible situations, life is still beautiful was brilliantly shown in (what else!) Life is Beautiful! <br/><br/>The one thing that the film did succeed in doing extremely well is the composition of shots. Watch the scene where the neighbor boy records Thora Burch with his video camera. We see the boy on the far left of the screen, staring at her offscreen. Burch stares out at the audience from the television. That is one perfect shot! There are several great scenes like this.<br/><br/>The part of the film which truly bothered me, though, was the way they handled the inevitable shooting. Throughout the film, we watch every important character talk about killing Spacey, and we see them all next to guns. This set up reminded me of the ""Who Shot Mr. Burns"" episode of the Simpsons. I don't know about the rest of you, but I thought it was rather obvious who the killer was going to be. I think Mendes put way too much emphasis on the murder which he set up at the beginning (and by the way, did he have to tell us all this at the beginning in the first place?). No one could have screwed up the amazing payoff at the end of the film though. i believe the main reason this film touched so many people must be the last scene. It is truly remarkable to behold!"

"jonie v.","3","1","3","5 October 1999"," the perennial malaise of the middle-class American male
","Although there are some things in this film that are indeed exceptional (art direction and set decoration, besides the more obvious acting etc.), I am just about shocked by the ease with which Hollywood manages to fall back on its most insinuating and pernicious attitudes towards women, the suburbs, the repression of desire, and moral bankruptcy. Okay, so: the American suburbs bread discontent and potentially explosive sick fantasies under a patina of well-behavior and perfectly manicured front lawns. And: children are the designated victims of adults' failure to keep off the edge on moral and existential insanity. How many times do we have to be told this? Isn't it what, for instance, The Ice Storm reminded us of recently? It, at least, had the historical decency to take place in the 70's. At the end of the 90's, I'd like something more meaty, more political, less self-indulgent, thank you very much.<br/><br/>As for politics, the sexual politics of this film are so sneakingly backwards as to make one wonder if feminism is really fallen off the edge of the world. Did you sympathize with the sad-but-heroic struggle of Kevin Spacey? I did, and I hated the director for making me do it. Annette Bening is great in this film, but her character is simply bitchy and monsterish and unredeemable. Her frigidity is so impermeable that she manages to resist EVEN Kevin Spacey's most touching ""let's start over"" efforts. Now isn't it sad? No, it isn't. It's sexist, and misguided and wrong. In fact, all through the film women are viewed as nothing more than the object of male desire, and if we are expected to look at this as some sarcastic criticism of male culture, well, there's simply no space in the film  for the critical distance needed to do this.<br/><br/>5/10 for artistic merit, with a lot of misgivings."

"Anonymous_Maxine","10","1","3","11 July 2001"," Another example of an excellent but largely misunderstood movie.
","American Beauty is another one of those movies that everyone seems to vote for as the Best Picture of the last ten years or so that did not deserve a Best Picture Oscar (yeah, you've seen the polls).  This is a perfect example of a widespread misunderstanding of the quality of the film. American Beauty is not a satire of the typical American family, as I've often heard it called. Nor is it a childish comedy on the level with Road Trip or American Pie, as I've also been shocked to hear it compared to. It is a film about America's obsession with superficial beauty and, perhaps even more, the complications and problems that come as a result of trying too hard to conform to the norms of modern society  associating happiness with financial success and whatnot.<br/><br/>Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is one of these people who has gotten the supposed cushy office job, he lives in a nice house in a nice neighborhood, has a beautiful and wealthy wife, and appears to be an all-around successful man. When we see closer into his life, however, we see that even though everything looks stable from the outside, his entire life is meaningless and falling apart. His wife does not respect him, she cheats on him, and their sex life is non-existent, his daughter is embarrassed by him, he realizes that he has a pointless job at which he is wasting his life away, and he knows that if he doesn't do something about all of this, he'll die with a healthy bank account and an empty soul.<br/><br/>Lester decides to throw away all of the meaningless crap that he has accumulated in his life and have fun. He quits his office job, which he hates, and gets a job at a fast food restaurant, which he surprisingly enjoys, he smokes pot with the neighbor's son, and he fantasizes about his daughter's friend, curiously named Angela. Is any of this wrong? Clearly, there is some debate about whether or not a 40-year-old man can, in good conscience, fantasize about a high school girl, more than any other of the questionable occurrences in the film. Personally, I think that this moral diversion comes as a result of his poor choices earlier in life which led to his current unhappiness and deviating thoughts. This is just another point that the movie is trying to get across. This is a guy who tried for his whole life to be socially and financially accepted, and look at how miserable and pathetic he is. You can complain all you want about this curious relationship, but keep in mind that at the end of the film, he gets a grip on himself and realizes what he is doing.<br/><br/>Clearly, the film revolves around Lester's struggles with himself and his life, but there are several other characters that are not as central but also play significant roles in the film. Lester's neighbor is an ex-marine experiencing anger management problems and difficulty with his sexual orientation, and this man's son Ricky is a strangely observant kid who lives in a difficult household but maintains a clear view of the important things<br/><br/>in life. Lester's daughter can't stand her family and is struggling with an attraction to Ricky that she initially doesn't understand and doesn't particularly like, and her friend Angela is the blonde cheerleader type who wants nothing more than to be accepted and respected, and she seeks these things through her huge efforts to be sexually attractive.<br/><br/>
This is a complicated character structure, and it is topped off by the striking character development that takes place in every single character in the movie by the end, and this is really one of the film's strongest points. In American Beauty, we don't see the life of a person as it is changed and affected by the world around him or her, we see the lives of a whole group of people as they interact with each other and change while following the rules set for them by the society that they grew up in. This makes the film much more effective and the message much clearer.<br/><br/>(spoilers) Clearly, this is something of a worst-case scenario, but nothing in the film is impossible. Everyone (at least those of us in America, I suppose) is capable of following the rules of society too closely and ending up miserable like Lester Burnham and his family and friends and neighbors, so watch out. Even Lester's terrible ending is not necessarily tragic. He knew when he quit his job and started working at a fast food restaurant, along with all of his other seemingly reckless behaviors, that he was endangering his future, but he was enjoying himself. He was feeling better than he had in years and years, and that mattered - as it should to all of us, to an extent - more than anything else. The only person left unhappy was the neighbor, who killed Lester because he still doesn't understand himself and is ashamed about something that he has discovered. Each character in the film represents a different lesson that can be learned by everyone. They're not all working together to deliver one big message, they're all giving something of their own, adding to the richness and superiority of the film as a whole. Make no mistake, all you poll voters, American Beauty WAS the Best Picture of 1999."

","I'd rather pound nails through my fingers than have to sit through AMERICAN BEAUTY again.  I don't say that lightly.  Nails.  Through.  My.  Fingers. Perhaps I've seen too many movies or read too many books about the inanities of suburban life, or perhaps I'm simply not EDGY enough to appreciate it. Whichever, the fact remains that AMERICAN BEAUTY, in my estimation, is a loathsome movie, smug and self-important, filled with characters who hate each other and themselves, and who in turn inspired me to hate them.  It's a film entirely without compassion towards its characters (excepting possibly Kevin Spacey, nominally the protagonist of the story), but without the nerve to go all the way and condemn them.  The filmmakers seem to want to have it both ways: pointing out the lack of soul and warmth in the human condition, while at the same time exalting the wonder and beauty of life.  In the end, they seem to be saying, We the Filmmakers are better than these ridiculous people, and You the Audience Member who is enjoying our film are better than these silly, petty people... but aren't they so very charming?  It's a movie made for the intelligentsia of our society, and the would-be intelligentsia--the Vanity Fair crowd, as a previous commentator so aptly put it--and they seem to be getting a kick out of it.  Me, I thought it was reprehensible.<br/><br/>Thing is, the movie's not INCOMPETENT.  Kevin Spacey puts in a characteristically fine performance, and the rest of the cast is decent. There's some pretty cinematography, and arresting images.  But the characters, except for Spacey's, are no more than caricatures, and cliches at that: the frigid careerist wife, the homophobic military man who, it turns out, is actually in the closet himself, the sullen teenage daughter, the oversexed beauty queen who's actually a virgin, the chirpy gay couple, and so forth...<br/><br/>AMERICAN BEAUTY is a movie that's neither as funny or as poignant as it wants to be.  Instead, it's a self-congratulatory exercise designed to make the tragically hip feel Deep and Insightful and good about themselves, without the heart or the conviction or the COMPASSION to communicate what it (seems to) want to.

Don't get me wrong: I loved American Beauty. But why the same type of award talk don't go to films like The Matrix or the 6th Sense? Simple: The Academy Awards gives priority to genres like period pieces, family dramas, and in another time, musicals, while ignoring genres like horror, action, science fiction and mystery, no matter how well crafted these films could be.

"kgh-3","3","1","3","26 September 1999"," American Beauty's Bad Breath
","In the two weeks or so since I saw a preview of American Beauty, I've been wondering whether I saw the same American Beauty as everyone else.  I can say without a doubt that the American Beauty that I saw was an awful movie.<br/><br/>Directed by Sam Mendes, American Beauty details the deterioration of a suburban American family, and focuses on the husband/father's (Kevin Spacey) mid-life crisis, wife/mother's (Annette Bening) infidelity, and Spacey and daughter's (Thora Burch) developing relationship with members of the household next-door.  The movie opens with a cause for immediate concern--Spacey's disembodied voice telling us more than we'd ever want to hear from said type of voice, including his apparent knowledge of his fate. Now, voice-over narration is a technique that should almost always be avoided, one used well in very few instances of very few movies. In American Beauty, it is particularly onerous and intrusive, and, given that this is not a supernatural movie, completely inappropriate.<br/><br/>But there is more than this wrong with American Beauty: it's a movie that's never really sure if it wants to be a black comedy, though inroads in that direction fall short in as much as the humor is flat or cliche. Bening's performance is often painful to watch (as she's hamming it up). Worst of all is the extent that Mendes and co. expect us to inherently believe things about this nuclear family, making absolutely *no* effort to suspend our disbelief.  The hatred of Spacey's character by both mother and daughter is unsupported: his daughter sites his lust for her friends, but while we see this directed toward one character in the movie there's no reason to believe this has ever happened before (the daughter doesn't speak to another young woman in the course of the whole movie!).  Bening's character, oblivious to his wandering lust, is also shown to have strong feelings against him, but the worst he's done is catch her with her lover. Maybe suburbanites just naturally hate dear old dad.  The movie even includes a couple of gratuitous topless scenes of the young women in the movie (and I'm no prude), and an utterly fake sex scene between Bening's body double and the lover.<br/><br/>
The one bright spot in this movie is the performance of Wes Bentley as the young man next door who sees the beauty in life others do not.  Alas, if the movie were about him, or only if his video of a plastic bag swirling in the breeze lasted much, much longer. Make no mistake about it, American Beauty--yes, _that_American Beauty--suffers from a serious case of bad breath."
"CubsandCulture","3","2","10","10 February 2019"," Spacey sinks the film completely, with some help from the screenplay
","The film is a drama and an acidic satire (dratire?) about how the dullness of consumerism/suburbia blinds people to the sublime and the atrocious in everyday life. The screenplay is sharp on these points with each character representing a different amount of sensitivity to the beauty of the everyday world. The script builds these themes around a 42 year-old men having a mid life crisis and having a erotic re-awaking by lusting after a 17 year old girl. The script and direction handle *that* about as well as one can expect. Angela is given a believable characterization to motivate her flirting with Lester. Furthermore, the most overt sexual material is explicitly flights of fancy on Lester's part. Critically, Lester saying no to the ultimate act shows the necessary respect for the issues of consent, age and proper behavior. The film is on a knife's edge throughout its run time with this stuff and it is critical the actor playing Lester does not come off as (too) creepy or predatory. Unfortunately, that actor is Kevin Spacey.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey has been credibly accused of sexual assault and harassment by several men, who at the time of the harassment were in their late teens-early 20's. I find it impossible to watch the Lester/Angela scenes while ignoring that. This ruins the film completely as you are supposed to find Lester's fate tragic and you are suppose to cheer him on. He is the character who wakes up to the sublimity of everyday life, i.e. the point but given that my skin crawls every time he is on screen the point isn't felt to say the least.<br/><br/>That is the main issue. There other big issue is the film stomps around ego-dystonic homosexuality with too little care. Frank Fitts' story is fine and in a sense believable in of itself. But you spend far too little time with the character to fully appreciate the hell is has been living all his life and unlike every other character he comes across as a flat character. He is a villain when he should be an antagonist. The entire development in the script feels grafted unto the film because Ball needed to kill Lester and he didn't want to have anyone else do it. The ego-dystonic homosexuality of Fitts is a mere plot device. The film suffers from it as a result.<br/><br/>These problems, especially Spacey, are rather unfortunate. The Ricky-Jane coming of age/love story feels very 90's and it deserves to be in a better film. Likewise, Bening gives a great performance of a women who mistakes outward prettiness for inner sublimity. And the cinematography is utterly gorgeous; it's moody with just enough artifice to fit satire of suburbia.<br/><br/>Through I must say it's just a plastic bag you smuck."

"zkonedog","7","1","4","2 March 2017"," Great Themes, But A Bit Esoteric In Overall Point
","""American Beauty"" is hailed as one of the premiere films of all-time for its ability to peel back the fake atmosphere of the American Suburb and look at things for how they really are. While the film definitely makes the viewer think about those themes, it also fails to make a real point about what it is trying to say.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""American Beauty"" centers on a family living the ""typical suburban life"" in America. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a middle-aged man with a decent-paying job providing for his family. He is also absolutely miserable in his existence. Wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) is an un-loving, career driven women who is just trying to ""hold things together"" in both her life and her family's. Daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is your typical awkward teenage girl...not knowing where she fits in either at home or at school. One day, the introduction of Jane's new beautiful, seductive friend Angela (Mena Suvari) to father Lester sparks in him some life that he long thought was lost. As Lester beings to throw caution to the wind and basically do what he wants, it sets in motion a chain of events that ripple throughout the entire community. Quirky neighbor boy Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley) capturing all the action on his hand-held camera provides a definitive record for the changes in suburbia.<br/><br/>Clearly, ""American Beauty"" is a very deep (theme-wise) type of film. It is meant to crash through preconceptions, break down boundaries, and getting people thinking about their lives. In this, the film pretty much succeeds. If you are a human being and breathing, you can probably find at least something to relate to in one (or more) of the characters in the film. Director Sam Mendes does a great job of peeling back the ""curtain of normality"" that many families live under, showing instead the seedier side of what is really going on. Many of these themes (middle-aged man's infatuation with a teen tart, homosexuality, promiscuity, etc.) will be quite uncomfortable to some viewers, but that is really the whole point. It is kind of meant to shock people in order to get them thinking.<br/><br/>The great acting of the movie also deserves special praise. This is pretty much the role that Spacey seems born to play (a little creepy, a little human), and at times he truly does steal the show. All the auxiliary cast around him, however, turn in great roles. Great character actor Chris Cooper even turns in a complex performance as ""Colonel Fits"". Without these very real character performances, ""American Beauty"" would have lost much of its gusto.<br/><br/>All of that being said, I can't quite put ""American Beauty"" into the upper echelon of my favorite films because it seems to be lacking a ""point"" to the whole exercise. If the goal of the entire project had been to get people thinking about life in suburbia (and only that), I think it would have appealed to me a bit more. As it is, however, it seems like the movie wanted to make a deeper point...a point that suburbia is not only ""fake"", but also ""harmful"" to individual psyches. I could write pages and pages here about these types of themes, but this isn't the forum for that (and it would include a ton of spoilers). Suffice it to say, though, that the film's narrative failed me a little bit in the end in that all the characters seem just as miserable having opened themselves up to their true purposes/desires as when they were repressed. As the final credits rolled, I found myself thinking over and over ""so...what exactly was the point of that?"".<br/><br/>So, I think that ""American Beauty"" is a solid film that will get any of its viewers thinking about issues relating to job/life stagnation and ""putting on a front"" for unhappiness that just masks the problem instead of dealing with it. An entire lifetime can be thrown away in this pattern. Beyond that, the film tries to be a bit more than that and, on those grounds, failed a bit (at least with me). Any fans of ""thinking cinema"" should at least give it a watch, as it is one of those movies that is tough to truly convey with words. It really must be seen and experienced in order to be ""understood""."

","The cinematography is utterly impeccable, yet it still somehow has the limited-scale feel of an indie production, which makes me feel like I can trust it -- like this isn't an impersonal studio exec's cash-grab, it's an individual's honest self-expression. <br/><br/>And the plot is about things I'd never seen before in a ""serious,"" well- produced movie -- a guy jerking off in the shower? Giving up a career and smoking pot even though you have a family to support? Going after your teenaged daughter's hot blonde friend? Why, this is groundbreaking! Honest! ""Progressive!"" What a commentary on the human condition! That's what I thought when I watched this when I was younger and very naive. Yet even then, it left me feeling unsettled, even disturbed.<br/><br/>I found it disturbing because this movie isn't an honest story about the human condition, like it pretends to be. ""Ordinary People"" is that movie. ""American Beauty"" and other pseudo-indie flicks that began popping up in the late 90s are some kind of propaganda for being a smug, lazy *sshole, framing a character who drops his responsibilities (at his family's expense!) as a hero. <br/><br/>When this Marxist turd came out, EVERYONE thought it was the absolute TITS. This is because the filmmakers found a way to pass off a movie about how cool it is to never grow up as high-brow art. Seriously, it's like the emperor's new clothes: Kevin Spacey jerking off in the shower, smoking pot, and going after some teenaged chick isn't really ""groundbreaking."" It's just some middle-aged guy dealing with the problems in his life by living like he's a teenager, the hell with his wife and daughter who depend on him. This is a bad message, which is the only ""groundbreaking"" thing about it. <br/><br/>You know f***ers, I can write that story too. How about a quirky indie flick called ""Edgar"" that's about the titular character in middle America who kidnaps and skins children alive. Except he's the hero, played as a mild-mannered retail clerk with a snarky but gentle sense of humor by Colin Farrell. Throw in some puddle-deep moral relativism claptrap to justify his actions and you've got American Beauty's logical next step toward brainwashing people into moral retards. <br/><br/>Also, the thing with the plastic bag in the wind being beautiful was just gay. I get it, it sounds deep and philosophical and people are afraid of being seen as dull if they don't agree. I also get that if a plastic bag in the wind is beautiful, then so is every other commonplace thing, like coffee pots and car exhaust. If everything on earth is beautiful, that robs you of the ambition to create beauty since it's already there. What a great excuse for not feeling bad about never doing anything.<br/><br/>By extension, if everything is beautiful, then all behavior is equally beautiful. Therefore morality is subjective. Therefore anything is justified as long as it ""feels right."" What a great way to lubricate the phallus of immorality into the quivering psychic vaginas of naive young people looking for an excuse to indulge in every selfish whim, regardless of the consequences.<br/><br/>this is why i don't like a lot of movies made since the late 90s. Like American Beauty, they frame immoral or harmful lifestyles as good or acceptable. ""Trainspotters,"" all about beautiful young heroin addicts, was like this. Where have all the grown-ups gone? Sh*t like drug addiction and just giving up on your obligations is traditionally looked down on for a reason."
"tavm","10","1","4","23 June 2012"," In the last 13 years, American Beauty remains a culturally worthy film to observe
","Having first watched this movie when it initially came out in theatres, I just saw it again with my mother on Netflix disc. It was fascinating listening to her react to the various weird things that happen in the movie. (She thought it was sick, by the way.) Certainly, the film is still something of a cultural item concerning the addressing of family dysfunctions as well as the many taboo things socially that get depicted or at the least implied during the whole thing. Kudos to writer Alan Ball, director Sam Mendes, score composer Thomas Newman, and stars Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari, and Chris Cooper, among others, for putting such a brave and provocative drama with a touch of unique humor that makes this film still a compellingly worthwhile experience to savor. So yes, that's very much a recommendation of American Beauty."
"thepsychocritic","5","1","4","8 January 2012"," A bird that flaps its wings but never quite takes off.
","Roses play a special part in the film. In the very second minute, the wife of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), Carolyn Burnham, is shown pruning those blood-red beauties. Seven minutes in, they make an appearance on the dinner table, followed by another at Carolyn's work table. Their significance could have been of some value, just when things get a little creepy, because rose-petals start appearing from inside a teenager's top as she opens it. They fall like fresh snow on Lester as he lies in bed. However, they do not feature merely in the imagination of a forty two year-old cougar. They have also been, and this by far is the most creative use of rose petals I have ever seen, used for tactfully covering exposed parts of a female's body as she lies in a pool full of, guess what, roses. And just in case the movie didn't make it obvious enough so far, it is titled American Beauty. <br/><br/>The film begins with a video recording of a teenage girl describing how her father is a 'horny, geek boy' who has the nasty habit of spraying his shorts whenever she brings a girlfriend a home. The man's daughter wants to 'put him out of his misery.' A male voice in the background asks if she would like him to kill her father. She stares at the camera, looking very much like the Ring-girl, and says 'Yeah. Would you?' because that is just how normal people behave. <br/><br/>The aforementioned man is the also-aforementioned Lester Burnham. He narrates the story in first person, which comes across as odd, since in the very sixth sentence he says that he will be dead in less than a year. Somehow, digested. He leads a rather unhappy life working at Media Monthly Magazine, constantly being overwhelmed by his wife. He lives in a world of hate - he hates his job, he hates his neighbours, he hates his boss, his wife hates him, his daughter hates him - not a very pleasant situation to be in. He is, by all standards, a gigantic loser going through a mid-life crisis; the time in his life when his wife doesn't even want to have sex with him. But, that isn't the worst of it. It isn't long before he develops an infatuation for one of his daughter's friends, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), whose mere sight serves as an aphrodisiac for the craving Lester. He dreams of her, gives her blank calls, eavesdrops on her conversations and goes to great lengths all in an attempt to get laid. <br/><br/>Instead of trying to keep things simple, American Beauty takes the wrong inspiration from Robert Frost and travels The-Road-Not-and-Should-Not- Have-Been-Taken, which leads to superficially and unnecessarily complicating things. Unfortunately, this serves as the ultimate digression for the movie. Heaping onto the basic storyline, the film introduces a scrupulous ex-military man as Lester's new neighbour, his laconic, lackadaisical son who has a penchant for spying on neighbours and shooting videos of perfectly normal things like a plastic-bag flying in the wind, Carolyn's competitor who she decides to sleep with while cheating on her husband, drugs, adultery, uncanny hallucinations, parental problems, among a plethora of other elements - till it turns the movie into a farrago of unrecognizable things, eventually making it masquerade as a cross between a wannabe-comedy and pretentious philosophy.<br/><br/>The message that the movie is trying to convey, through this almighty mess, is very similar to what Dead Poets Society (1989 - ten years before) and Fight Club (1999 - the same year) have tried to preach - stand up to the status quo, don't let your belongings own you, live life the way you want to - same old, same old. The anarchistic streak that Lester develops is inspirational and funny, but not really a way of life that should be adopted by people, and the end very well justifies why not.<br/><br/>The film had the potential to be great comedy. The situation and atmosphere were ideal. So were the characters - a pushover of a husband, a termagant wife, a daughter who hates them both, a hot-friend with the man falling for the latter. Though not highly original, that script, had a high laughter-capability. Unfortunately, in an effort shove more down the throat than it could handle, it wasted it all. There are a few moments of glory though - Lester learning to stand on his feet, jerking off in bed, lifting weights with nothing but socks on - scattered laughter here and there, but nothing that could have been. <br/><br/>The movie maintains a dark atmosphere that culminates in a dark ending, both really impressive features. The film holds onto its funereal air and this moribidity becomes palpable in the end. Though the finale comes through an unbelievably, incomprehensively stupid misunderstanding, it holds good on its own, while even managing to touch an emotional chord. The last ten minutes or so play a heroic act for a film that has its moments but never manages grows to its capabilities."

"mnpollio","6","1","4","25 January 2011"," Some brilliant parts, but the whole is underwhelming
","Interesting, but staggeringly overrated comedy-drama focusing on the rot and discontent underneath the pristine front of suburbia. The film opens with narration from Kevin Spacey advising us that he is dead and detailing the events that led to his demise. Spacey is a typical example of the depressed suburban husband and father. His marriage to shrewish Realtor wife Annette Bening is miserable and he is barely on speaking terms with truculent daughter Thora Birch, who is developing a flirtation with the shy young videographer/drug dealer next door (Wes Bentley). Spacey cracks when he is forced out of his company and goes through a complete life change - including striking up a friendship with Bentley and a flirtation with his daughter's jailbait high school friend Mena Suvari. This is something of an odd film tone-wise. I can find few people that will say they out-and-out love it, but instead they will concentrate on certain elements and praise those factors to the exclusion of others. The acting is really a selling point for this film. Spacey simply has never been better and will probably always be identified with this role. The young cast members are all quite compelling. Suvari's arrogant pretensions give way to a rather touching vulnerability late in the film, while Birch reveals an appealing side with Bentley that is missing from her interactions with her parents. Bentley has also never been better as the intense guy next door, who sells drugs and copes with abusive homophobic dad Chris Cooper, but manages to find beauty through his video camera in the most unlikely places. The remainder of the adults fare less well. Allison Janney has a thankless role as Bentley's catatonic mother, while Cooper is largely a one-note caricature. Much ink has been spilled about Bening and while one can give kudos that she is unafraid to tackle head on a thoroughly unappealing character, it is undeniable that she is really playing a nasty harpy on one strident note. Spacey keeps reminding us that she ""was not always like this"", but our only indication is a flashback to her laughing on a carnival ride, which is hardly conclusive of any range to her character. Some of her scenes - beating herself up after failing to make a sale and the laughable sex scenes with Peter Gallagher - are downright amateurish. There are a number of sequences in this film that are truly arresting and memorable, but for every one that astonishes there are an equal amount that go no where or just completely fizzle. Indeed the film seems to carry an attitude that it is much more insightful than it truly is. The entire scenario of dysfunction underneath the surface of suburbia and its denizens revealing themselves to be polar opposites of what their surface may hint is an old plot device used often well before American Beauty discovered it, so what this film presents is hardly novel or groundbreaking. The end result is a polished film featuring some strong performances and a handful of amazing moments, counteracted by a number of forgettable plot contrivances, a surprising shallowness and an uneven tone that often keeps the viewer at an emotional arm's length."
"Tithy","10","1","4","16 September 2008"," Masterpiece of beauty
","From the first time I saw it, this film became my favorite, not only for its beauty or its message, but also for the quote of life in it. Once I read that your ultimate ""favorites"" (songs, TV series, movies) are those in which you can see yourself reflected, the ones about YOUR life. Well, this is MY favorite movie because I really mean it. Life for me has changed a lot these years, since 1999 everything has turned into something different, the thing I didn't know was that everything can change, but can continue being equally beautiful. Why I write all of these, well, last night I saw this movie again, after at least 4 years without even look at it, and I found it fascinating. It is not only amazingly well-done, it is also perfectly well-executed. The performances of Spacey and Benning are really touching, you can feel as she at one second, and as he at the other; you can really smell the quality of their acting, and suffer as you were them. The rest of the cast is incredible as well, you can really fear being an ordinary person with Suvary, or capture the beauty in life with Bentley. I truly recommend this movie principally because Mendes really did it, really realized a movie which made us look closer. An extremely well-production, captivating music and the most carefully ideal art direction constitute the cherry of this perfect cake of pure and simply beauty."

","""American Beauty"" is a fine movie, but multiple viewings reveal some cracks, mostly having to do with contrivances. For example, the two Jims are clearly in the movie simply to fend off charges of homophobia resulting from the ending. <br/><br/>Also, Lester and his wife are set up to be too diametrically opposite  she worships success and he basically drops out and ""goes hippie"" when he loses his job. Wouldn't it have been cooler if she was the one secretly smoking pot? <br/><br/>Col. Fits' hatred for his son is too much. It's just implausibly ferocious, especially given his son's serene response.

","Ever since the relentless suburbanization of America in the post-world war era, a solid indictment of its banality, escapism, hypocrisy, wastefulness, artificiality, effeminacy, and ultimate futility has been long overdue. Sadly, this film is not that indictment. (Critics of suburbia have abounded, but largely from a left-libertine standpoint. This is ironic, given that suburbanites are as likely to include aging hippie university professors as culturally indifferent white-collar professionals.)<br/><br/>It is not surprising that Steven Spielberg, probably the most overrated and undeservedly successful filmmaker alive, would have hand-picked this film and its director. A socially critical art-house flick was clearly beyond the abilities of the whole trio, but then, Hollywood has always been more about egos than talent.<br/><br/>Sure enough, Alan Ball and Sam Mendes fall into the same sort of stereotyping, clichés, and flat, off-the-mark storytelling as Spielberg himself. Dysfunctional suburban couples do indeed abound, but from my experience, more often than not suburbanites do not take marriage seriously enough not to divorce over petty niceties. And do we really need another film in which the homophobic alpha male is secretly harboring same-sex tendencies?<br/><br/>Ultimately, too, the ending negates any depiction of suburban life is inherently harmful to its adherents, choosing as it does to depict a family destroyed by outside force rather than its own internal stupidity. The nod toward sophistication is clearly a mere nod. Steve, my lad, let's go back to Jurassic Park, shall we?"

The film tells the story of his life, just before he dies. Annete Bening in a fabulous role plays his wife, having an affair. Thora Birch is Kevins daughter in love with the weird kid next door. Mena Suvari is the highlight of the film, with the famous red flower bath scene. Mena looks incredibly sexy playing the girl with dirty intentions.

","What a colossal disappointment. This film has no redeeming qualities for me and I am astonished that this is considered to be an Academy Award-winning effort. It's a profoundly cynical and sleazy look at a suburban family and their various dysfunctional interactions with each other and their friends and neighbors. The only character who seemed like a halfway decent person once you got beneath her veneer of worldliness was the daughter, played by Thora Birch. The screenplay is obsessed with gratuitous profanity and a strange and somehow puerile fixation on masturbation. These are shallow characters at best, reprehensible and amoral at worst. Particularly during the second half, this became somewhat reminiscent of Blue Velvet, the David Lynch film, without the grotesqueness. Some of the dialog was stilted and absurd. Hasn't the theme of suburban alienation been attempted before and with greater success?"

Title refers to the ordinariness people accept and the secrets they hide. Lester Burnham hates his job. His marriage is a function for his wife's publicity. He explains that the high point of his day is masturbating in the shower. And he is fixated on his daughter's cheerleader friend. A marine and his family move in across the street. His son works catering jobs to afford drugs, and his watches Lester's daughter via camera from across the street. Stunning directing by Sam Mendes with skilled cinematography. Kevin Spacey is humorous as a man unaware of the consequences of new choices but he plunges full force into a privileged agenda without care until he is placed at the crossroads of the needs of others and appreciating his life. Annette Bening hides her affair under professionalism while slowly caving to the maddening affects of no control. Insecure Thora Birch as their daughter is secretly flattered as the object of an ominous camera. Chris Cooper plays the neighbour whose marine training is crossed with family. Mena Suvari plays a teenage fantasy rebelling innocence within the fluttering red of descending rose peddles. Ads say ""Look Closer"" at the person within trying to break free. Score: 9 / 10"

If this is Sam Mendes idea of brilliant direction, he's taken the acting talents of Spacey and Bening spewing lines of hatred and practically turned them into freshman acting school robots. Script? What script? This is a juvenile fantasy made to appear ""grown up"". Fast Times at Ridgemont High had more real life drama and substance then this...and THAT film was juvenile, but at least it had some entertainment value.<br/><br/>You could say I'm judging this film unfairly because I didn't bother watching it in its entirety. But if after 30 minutes a film doesn't have any conviction to convey some sort of plot, story, message or substance--it's not worth my time and it shouldn't be worth yours. For those who are trying to find some ""deep"" philosophical meaning to all the rose petals, I say have a cup of coffee and get off the Zoloft and Prozac."

Kevin Spacey plays his ""Lester"" to perfection - the moment when he decides NOT to indulge in a fantasy is just as uplifting as it would have been otherwise; it is his salvation.<br/><br/>********** American Beauty (9/8/99) Sam Mendes ~ Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley"
"bkoganbing","10","1","6","22 July 2008"," New Neighbors Take Out An Old Marriage
","American Beauty finds successful forty something couple Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening coming to a crossroads in their marriage. Each of them is going through a mid-life crisis, manifesting itself quite differently in them and in their daughter, Thora Birch. The three of them have become like strangers occupying the same household and no kind of family.<br/><br/>Spacey is bored with his job, his wife, and his life. His boredom is showing in his work and he's asked to leave, but not after extracting a nice severance package. Going back to his days as a youth, he gets a job in a fast food place and he buys an expensive classic car he's always wanted to own. And he's taken an interest in his daughter's friend Mena Suvari.<br/><br/>Bening has become enamored of success and self help programs. She's a real estate salesperson and tries hard, maybe too hard. Sensing Spacey's indifference to her she drifts into an affair with real estate mogul Peter Gallagher. He actually tries at one point to rekindle things, but she worries more about Spacey spilling beer on the couch. Talk about cooling off the romance.<br/><br/>All their lives change when they meet the new neighbors, the Fits Family. Withdrawn subdued mother Allison Janney and son Wes Bentley who is a drug dealer and who interests both Birch and Spacey for different reasons.<br/><br/>But the most interesting part in American Beauty for me is Colonel Frank Fits of the USMC, father and husband and a man with a lot of issues that you will find out if seeing American Beauty. Though Spacey was Best Actor for 1999 and Annette Bening was nominated for Best Actress, but lost to Hilary Swank for Boys Don't Cry, to me Chris Cooper's performance as Colonel Fits steals the whole film.<br/><br/>Director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball who won Oscars in their categories respectively opted for the Sunset Boulevard format of having the movie at intervals narrated by protagonist Kevin Spacey just as William Holden narrated the Billy Wilder classic. But the whole feel of this film most reminds me of the Gothic characters of Reflections In A Golden Eye. Even the fact that one of the major characters is a military man. Back in the day Reflections In A Golden Eye was a box office failure, but the success of American Beauty proves just how far ahead of its time Reflections In A Golden Eye was.<br/><br/>Oh and I forgot, American Beauty was the winner of the Best Picture Oscar of 1999. It's destined to be an American classic Beauty for generations."

","I am absolutely astounded that this film did so well at the academies. Granted, Kevin Spacey is a marvelous actor, but this whole picture had me wondering why a middle aged man cannot just accept the fact that he's a sex fiend. Poor Thora Birch was given a role that suppressed her ability to portray her talent as a young actress, and what on Earth was that silly video about with the plastic bag just floating through the air? So, let me get this straight; everyone at the Academy Awards chose this film over ""The Green Mile,"" The Insider, and ""The Cider House Rules?"" Where is the justice? All of those films had more ""character"" to them than that idiotic movie. Kevin can do such fine work too, such as when he was a negotiator in ""The Negotiator"" with Samuel L. Jackson. What a complete waste of time, and how depressing it must have been for the other great films which were nominated against this offensive, shallow-minded, B rated film! Positively the worst film to win best picture in Academy history."

It kind of reminded me of 'Payback.' There wasn't a good guy/gal to get behind and root for. It was lacking. Also, the movie was billed as a comedy. It was most definitely NOT funny. I didn't laugh (or even chuckle) once! I felt dirty after watching it. All the characters creeped me out. THIS is typical America?! If I'm naïve, then please leave me be. My world is much happier and morally sound not perfect, but at least trying and knowing what is wrong and right.

","The debut film from Oscar and Golden Golden winning, and BAFTA nominated director Sam Mandes (Road to Perdition, Jarhead) is a brilliant black comedy drama with all the right ingredients. Basically Lester Burnham (deserved Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Kevin Spacey) is a troubled man who seems bored with life. He is getting sick of his wife Carolyn (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Annette Bening), who is having an affair with her rival estate agent, Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher). His daughter Jane (gorgeous BAFTA nominated Thora Birch) meanwhile is falling for neighbour Ricky Fits (BAFTA nominated Wes Bentley), while Lester is having fantasies about her friend, the slutty (?) Angela Hayes (American Pie's BAFTA nominated Mena Suvari). Ricky's father Col. Frank Fits, USMC (Chris Cooper) finally is pretty much being influenced to becoming homosexual. This film is basically the struggles of relationships, mixed with some great comedic moments, and an unexpected ending. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Music for Thomas Newman and Best Editing, it won the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Film, and it was nominated for Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound and the David Lean Award for Direction, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Original Score. Kevin Spacey was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and the film was number 29 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments for Spacey in bed watching Suvari on the ceiling, with rose petals falling.

"marcusman48","1","1","12","5 March 2020"," What...What was the point?
","AMERICAN BEAUTY is, to put it quite bluntly, an embarrassment. At least if you consider yourself an accomplished filmmaker. True, if the director were severely mentally challenged, this film would deserve all the praise in the world for its ironically glamorous style. But that would only prove how low a bar this movie set for itself, because plenty of movies out there are pretty to look at.<br/><br/>While I could have believed that Sam Mendes and his crew won some Academy Awards at some point in their career, I never in a million years would have believed that they could have won the award for THIS! I'd even go far enough to say that THE MATRIX deserved the 1999 Best Picture award more than this did - and THE MATRIX was little more than trendy trash.<br/><br/>Even when watching this as a relatively naïve teenager, I could sense how hollow and trite AMERICAN BEAUTY was at its core. Did we really need a two-hour domestic drama to tell us that ""suburbanites are weird and they're harboring shameful secrets?"" You can get the gist of that from watching most Tim Burton films - and be more entertained than here, too. Not to mention that the above cliché was already, well, a cliché as early as the Fifties.<br/><br/>And speaking of the Fifties, I can't help wondering if, had Mendes made AMERICAN BEAUTY four decades earlier, he would have won even more Oscars. Because here he rips off a LOT of films from that era, and not only are they very famous films but they're considered classics. Dead guy as a narrator? SUNSET BOULEVARD already did it (and DOUBLE INDEMNITY did it even earlier, albeit with an ALMOST dead guy). Secretly taking pictures of people? REAR WINDOW already did it. A middle-aged man cheating on his wife for a much younger woman? One of the oldest plots in history - but, more to the point, THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH already did it.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the biggest slap in the face of all. The young woman in question (who is not the ""American Beauty"" rose garden of the title, but is explicitly associated with it) is not Marilyn Monroe but Mena Suvari - a girl who would need only the smallest amount of makeup to portray a vampire. Sorry if that sounds mean, but it's true. Even when Suvari is doing her utmost to be sexy (and this film certainly makes the effort), her pale and cadaverous face is pretty hard to ignore. For that reason alone, this movie's plot makes no sense. It's not much of an exaggeration to say that in real life most men wouldn't consider it worth the risk to betray even a 100-year-old Annette Bening for Mena in her prime.<br/><br/>I must admit that I'm glad this movie exists, if only for the reason that I get to mock it and joke about it. And I can't help thinking that it works on SOME level. You might consider it a feature-length, VERY dark cheesy sitcom spoof. Or a very polished student film done as a warmup during the first semester. Or something to leave in a time capsule for our distant descendants or a visiting alien race who wanted to learn about twentieth-century American movie stereotypes.<br/><br/>But it does NOT work on the Oscar level."

Is there not there, unfulfilled desire to have that need to produce this kind of scenario? I'm sure if we took the time to analyze the different productions of this kind we could come to a disastrous conclusion. Was there not, also, a well known photographer who had taken care of a young boy and who has a documentary produced on him? how is it that, there are several things in our society that give us alarms and discomfort, but manage to make their way to the Oscars?

","I have come to see the movie with a certain prejudice. Everyone saying that it was so wonderful, so touching, so excited -- I usually tend to go with movies that nobody likes. Nevertheless, this one was a certain exception.<br/><br/>It is a wonderful psychological drama, a satire about the American community and about the American life; dark, painful irony and cynicism in the descriptions of life and characters; deep sarcasm on types of people in the community, habits of behaviour such as ""...if you want to succeed, you always have to seem successful..."" or ""never stop smiling"", parasites of the community, and, most importantly, the treatment of people who are ""different"", who are ""freaky"" to some extent; and eventually, there is no character in the film that is not odd in its way, although we have to wait for the very ending of the film, to discover this.<br/><br/>With very deep and accurate exaggeration, (most of) the characters in the movie demonstrate the worst, the darkest sides of their personality, while still remaining very human, very touching and very involving the observer. Everyone can find a certain similarity with characters and persons who he met in his life, in the characters described in the film. The tragi-comical events, the little pieces of funny, disturbing irony dripping from almost every episode, lead the observer to exploration of the American Beauty -- the beauty in life, and the way that we fail to find it, for all our life; the way we hide our feelings and emotions, even behind sullen walls of our sepulchre.<br/><br/>The acting is truly brilliant, the episodes are built logically, coherently, the dialogues are deep, thrilling, intriguing; every sentence and every word is deeply constructed, containing profound irony and intelligent elements of humors. The plot is very intelligently built, constructing a true indication of the sad situation of the American society, and an excellent ground for the actors."
"jdoupe","8","0","1","6 February 2020"," Rough Start, Good Ending
","The beginning of the movie came across as boring, watching a messed up family have a middle life crisis, but as the film progressed it improved greatly. The humor in the film and the extreme difference in the characters made the show come to life. The acting of Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening was beyond impressive. They brought a whole new level to the screen as they took their characters from one end to the spectrum to the other. They also showed the raw feelings of how life can take you into a rut with how tough and hard it can be. The only thing I found difficult to watch was an older man having graphic sexual fantasies about an under aged girl, and acknowledging that they acted those scenes out in real life."
"andrewroy-04316","4","0","6","17 December 2019"," In trying to provide clever satirical commentary and be deep and thoughtful, American Beauty exposes how shallow and underdeveloped it really is
","It makes perfect sense how American Beauty has aged so poorly, but I am surprised by how much both audiences and critics loved it at the time of release. More than anything, American Beauty is completely all over the place thematically and has uninteresting and motivationless characters. Mendes wants to make a satire on suburban life and how a family's life falls apart in many tiny ways, but the pieces simply don't cohere. Lester is the protagonist and vehicle for the surburban crisis and upheaval the family goes through, but Mendes (and honestly more so Ball's script) can't decide what light to paint him in, or even what moral message his actions are meant to send. Once the scene is set with this seemingly average suburban family, we see Lester's frustrations mount and his small rebellions, from his lust for Angela to his smoking weed to quitting his job. As he becomes more open and shameless about these transgressions (which, it is worth noting, are framed and reacted to by Lester and his family as equally reprehensible, which is another frustration I had), he gets happier and his body language is noticeably freer. Gone is the hunched over, quiet dad, replaced with the dad who throws asparagus at the wall and says what he wants. I guess this says don't bottle up your frustrations? Then, after seeing his wife is having an affair and Angela offers herself to him, Lester is played as the hero, given an easy out and framed as happy and doing an honorable thing by not having sex with her, only to die right after as a martyr. His character certainly didn't deserve such an ending, and the final voiceover rings hollow as can be - Mendes tries to hand wave a larger message about how the world is beautiful and he feels nothing but gratitude looking back at his life? If I'm taking any coherent message from this jumbled film (which, I want to be absolutely clear, I am not), it would be far from something about the world having beauty and instead something about how people have expectations of the people they should be and hide their true desires behind these false personas. Even this is contradicted in some cases, as Carolyn is a perfect example. She never feels like a real person, and after having Lester find out about her affair she is prepared to shoot him only to find someone else had done it for her. It's not clear what she wanted all movie (except to sell that one house early on), and it couldn't be less clear why she was muttering ""I will not be the victim"" repeatedly as she prepared to confront her husband with a gun. Her character is extremely poorly written and has a nonsensical arc. Angela is actually a pretty good character, injecting some humor into the film and with a strong performance. The interplay between her and Jane is good, if nothing more than standard high school social screenplay, and the late reveal that she was a virgin emphasized the degree to which she was performing the role she was expected to have, and wasn't really who she claimed to be. Jane is also on the more nuanced side of characters in this movie, written much more realistically than the adults in this movie and one of the only characters we can sympathize with. Ricky is a decent character, but the events with his father at the end, culminating in his father trying to kiss Lester and then coming back and shooting him were really forced. The gay repression storyline was a prime example of the movie trying to be smart and deep and coming off as extremely shallow - the father is ashamed of his sexuality so he sees the worst in his son and lashes out, and then when he finds someone he thinks he can trust, the father finds out he was wrong and kills Lester. The ""twists"" of who actually killed Lester were truly stupid, especially because it adds literally nothing to the story since both were prepared to kill him. The score also didn't work for me at all, with several montages using the score to act like a character is doing well and getting things done as the marimba plays faster, and it feels contrived and heavy handed. It's not a dull film, and I don't even think it's particularly poorly made, with some good cinematography (I like the rose petals evoking fantasy sequences and the allure of lust and love) and mostly believable performances, but the script is so bad and so convinced that it's clever as to ruin the film. While not similar in any way in type of film, as I ponder the themes and messages that pervade the film, I feel more and more that none of these pieces fit together or make any sense, similarly to how I felt as I thought about Vice. It's the ending, trying to tie everything together as a message of beauty in life, that really convinces me that this is simply not a good movie, that the director's vision falls flat here. As this is my first Mendes film, I'm strongly hoping and expecting to like Jarhead and 1917 more."

Along this journey he revisits his youth, comes to terms with his wife's infidelity and tries to connect with his daughter and others around him.

","In fact, ""American Beauty"" may not be correctly termed a black comedy at all. Nor is it a domestic drama, although it certainly has elements of both genres. Rather, it's a thrill ride on a par with the most adrenal summer blockbuster. Only here, the explosions are all emotional, as the movie takes film goers on a pinball-like journey from one potent reaction to another.<br/><br/>Most of those reactions center on Lester Burnham (Spacey), whom we meet in a ""Sunset Boulevard""-like introduction in which he announces he's 42, lives on an attractive street in a good neighborhood, has a beautiful wife and daughter, and within a year he'll be dead. A preamble suggests the events that will lead to his untimely demise, but very little is what it seems in a world in which projecting the right image is all.<br/><br/>After his deadpan introduction, Burnham shows us the days and nights that precede his death. We see his wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), a driven real estate agent whose dedication to preserving appearances approaches white-knuckled desperation, and we meet their daughter Jane (Thora Birch), a sullen teen-ager who sulks through the house like a brooding, wounded animal.<br/><br/>Lester's family life is a shambles, but the pivotal event in his soon-to-be-ended life is his introduction to Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), Jane's sexually precocious best friend. If that last name rings a bell, it's no accident. Like Delores Haze in ""Lolita,"" Angela has a catalytic effect on Lester, who becomes as besotted as a schoolboy. He also begins to make some major changes in his life, which account for the film's most painfully amusing scenes.<br/><br/>Lester's transformation sends Carolyn and Jane on their own journeys of self-discovery. In Jane's case, that involves the Burnhams' new next-door neighbor, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), the 18-year-old son of an abusive Marine captain played with sinewy toughness by Chris Cooper. Ricky likes Jane -- he thinks she's more interesting than the prosaically blond Angela -- and he's taken to filming her with a digital camera whenever he can.<br/><br/>Is Ricky's voyeuristic hobby a dangerous predilection or simple curiosity? Is Lester a pedophile or, as he puts it, ""just an ordinary man with nothing to lose""? ""American Beauty"" is suffused with a palpable sense of danger, keeping filmgoers unsettled until the very end as to what exactly motivates these complicated characters. And no punches are pulled when they're at their worst: Ricky's father's violent outbursts are sickening in their suddenness and brutality, and Lester's lust is repulsive even at its most pathetically funny.<br/><br/>But the movie never loses sight of the humanity behind even the most reprehensible acts. It's a balancing act pulled off with unusual intelligence by Mendes and screenwriter Alan Ball, who have inspired these accomplished actors to give the performances of their lives.<br/><br/>Heretofore consigned to supporting roles, albeit critical ones, Spacey commands the screen with a performance of subtlety, vulnerability and supreme confidence, in which he expresses mordant self-mockery and poignance in a single gesture. Evoking Jack Lemmon at his most un-mannered, Spacey brings flawless comic timing to Lester's self-absorbed, infantile and rapacious behavior. (His smirking style is just right for Lester's snarky outbursts.) But he also holds on to the pathos of Lester's rage, turning what looks like just another midlife crisis into a rebirth, in which something long dormant flutters tentatively to life.<br/><br/>Spacey might carry ""American Beauty"" (on nicely buffed shoulders, it bears adding), but filmgoers shouldn't ignore some equally potent performances: Bening's breakdown in an empty house is a heart-stopping aria of despair, self-loathing and taut control. And all three teen players -- especially the ethereal-looking Bentley, who delivers the movie's central message with touching gentleness -- give sturdy and courageous portrayals in roles that would daunt actors twice their ages.<br/><br/>Director of photography Conrad Hall has photographed the Burnhams' world to exploit its surface shine, while Thomas Newman's score underlines its slightly surreal undertones. Production designer Naomi Shohan has done a witty job with the color red, whose almost decadent vibrancy is repeated throughout ""American Beauty,"" from Carolyn's prized roses and Angela's mouth to a vintage Pontiac Firebird and a poetically still pool of blood.<br/><br/>Masterfully calibrating all of these elements, as well as coaxing out the most human and fully realized performance of Spacey's career, Mendes has created a movie that will endure. Unlike similarly themed films like ""Happiness"" and ""Your Friends and Neighbors,"" ""American Beauty"" doesn't rely on just shock value to wow audiences. The shocks here all transpire on the level of the human heart, where the ability to be astonished will never wear thin, a fact ""American Beauty"" proves with uncommon assurance, grace and compassion."

","American Beauty is quite simply a cinematic masterpiece. With each passing minute as the plot evolves it delves into a topic that is often not portrayed with such exquisiteness and that is the topic of life. Be it the sheer brilliance of Spacey's performance, or the combination of the films dark and comedic factors, it delivers a piece of cinema that leaves your mouth slightly ajar muttering the word ""wow"". Remaining true to its title, Sam Mendes delivers this beauty to be what I consider the greatest movie of all time, and in his first cinematic directorial role. From start to finish the film tells a tale that is applicable in some sense to everyone, who feels they lead a life of the mundane. Life isn't black and white and American Beauty teaches each viewer that it can be whatever you choose. The narrative is powered through with Spacey and Benning's magnificent co-starring, and truly leaves an imprint that will never be forgotten in the history of cinema. It is sublime."

","American Beauty is a film that was produced in 1999, nearly seventeen years ago, but was by far one of the best movies I have seen. When first deciding to watch the movie, I reviewed what is was about and was immediately convinced I would love the movie. The movie is about a suburban father who is tired of his life and peaks an interest in his daughters best friend.<br/><br/>It was directed by Sam Mendes, who is also responsible for directing Skyfall, and producing Revolutionary Road and Road to Perdition. A few of the main characters are Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham, Annette Bening as Carolyn Burnham, Thora Birch as Jane Burnham, and Mena Suvari as Angela Hayes. <br/><br/>Some of the thematic ideas I have established in watching the film are coming of age, social problems, human dignity, and human relationships. If you've seen the film then you are aware of how strange the relationships are in this film. Of all the themes I've considered, human relationships are my number one pick. <br/><br/>The movie was slow at first. I actually considered turning it off within the first 10 minutes of the film, but it seemed I couldn't turn the movie off. I'm glad I didn't, because as stated before, the movie was one of the best ones I've seen. My recommendation to you is to pay attention to all the characters and all of the details. I found myself storing little nuggets of information to pull back out for the finale at the end of the movie. <br/><br/>In my opinion all of the characters did an excellent job at playing their parts. The relationships are that of some I have never seen before, but they are one of the things you should pay close attention to. Colors and lighting are compliments to the message the director is trying to send. Overall the movie had smooth transitions and great editing. I promise when you start watching and the plot thickens you won't be able to stop watching until it's over."

","American Beauty...is such a special film in that if you saw the trailer and knew about the basic plot, skimmed through the actors, you'd expect one thing - a predictable tale of modern America's criticism of how the middle class is decaying and has created a society full of dysfunctionals and sickos underneath the surface... - and that one thing you expected, is exactly what you get; however, they still made it a brilliant film. The subplots contribute to the overall feel of the film, so mysterious and magical. The characters are extreme but mirror our society so perfectly that they are outright fictional caricatures and yet remind us of people we all have known. This is a modern fairy-tale motion picture which holds as a main theme the despondency of all members of our society, each layer (teenagers, young adults, parents...) with its own specific existential fracture. The story is excellent, right from the start and throughout the bulk of the movie, up until the excellent climax at the end that is oh so fitting and a true powerful finish - and there is a romanticism about the atmosphere whether through narration, music or image; like a poetry of death. And it's actually moving, rather than plain immoral or silly. This sick world we've put around ourselves."

Spacey is such a great actor that he brings a magnetism to every single role that he is in e.g Se7en and the Usual Suspects. Stylistically the film is also brilliant.

These similarities combined with the brutally realistic characters helps the black humor within the movie. The pursuit of happiness and limitations that come with reality are the controlling ideas of this movie.<br/><br/>We watch the pursuit of Lester, a character who can be considered as an anti-hero easily. He is not a regular protagonist who, at the end of the day, saves the town, fight against corruption in the office and do everything to save his marriage. Instead, Lester blackmails his boss, fantasizes about his daughter's friend and reconnects to life by smoking pot in his garage.<br/><br/>I can't talk for everyone but I didn't loose the connection with Lester beginning to end. I watched and supported his growth affectionately. His character proves that the pursuit of happiness is possible for the 'sick and corrupted' as well.<br/><br/>Hollywood already gave us a blueprint of how a happy suburban family should look like.

","American Beauty is about suburban families that have their own problems and are not a happy, loving family. They consider themselves ""ordinary"" and do not like that title. Kevin Spacey plays the father, Lester Bernham. It seems as if he is going through a mid-life crisis and has slipped into depression. Annette Bening plays the mother, Carolyn Bernham. She wants that ""picture perfect"" family and is not happy that they have difficulty portraying that in front of others. Thora Birch plays the daughter Jane that is going through her own problems. Her father is not involved with her and does not speak to her about anything. Lester, Carolyn and Jane each think that their lives are dull and boring and want to try to make them more fulfilling and exciting. They want to see if the grass is indeed greener on the other side. They continuously try changing their lives throughout the movie to fulfill their dreams and try to have some excitement in their lives. Lester was not happy at his current job, so he quit and started working in a fast food restaurant. He begins to start working out so he could get girls or women to notice him and boost his ego. Lester meets Ricky Fits, played by Wes Bently, when Jane begins dating him. Lester soon finds out that Ricky deals pot and starts buying it off of him and starts smoking it. Jane meets the new neighbor, Ricky and begins dating him. Jane and Ricky are both weird, but they understand each other and make each other happy. She is able to talk to Ricky about what her life is really like and is not ashamed of it. Carolyn begins having an affair with a guy that she believes has the perfect life. She has craved the ""perfect life"", so she thought this affair would make her happy. She likes guns, and begins to go to the shooting range and having fun. Kevin Spacey is one of the best actors and in this film you see a lot of his emotion come out in his character. You can feel the sadness and depression in his life. The lighting is natural and some of the scenes have distorted sounds and images, but that is the way Lester is seeing it. American Beauty probably hits home with several people, because this is something real and that could happen in their lives. If you're not happy in the life you have chosen, you should do something about it. Make yourself happy and reach for all of your goals."
"oliverwilliamknight","8","0","2","7 December 2015"," A movie that teaches you to never judge a book by it's cover
","American Beauty is an exceptionally well crafted piece of art, a piece of art that teaches us to never judge a book by it's cover. Sam Mendes, director, and Conrad Hall, cinematographer, link up for this first time in this movie and create an absolute masterpiece. The whole aesthetic of the movie just works. From the atmospheric lighting to the camera angles you really see something special about the Mendes-Hall dynamic. This dynamic comes into play again in the 2002 'Road to Perdition'. These two are truly skilled at their respective professions and there's no question that Mendes deserved an Academy Award and Golden Globe. From the outset it's clear that, aside from the cinematography and directing, the acting is one of the most prime attractions of the film. Kevin Spacey plays a man who is almost tormented by his lust for his teenage daughters friend. However, don't be fooled. This movie does not center around an adult who persistently craves the attention and love of a minor, despite IMDb's almost-misleading one liner. The movie focuses on Kevin Spacey's character, Lester, who is surviving a broken marriage, a terrible relationship with his daughter and a deplorable relationship with his work peers. Spacey's acting is excellent and throughout the entire narrative you'll never see him leave character, with Kevin's character always appearing to be tormented and misguided. Another prominent acting performance comes from Mena Suvari, who plays Lester's daughters friend. Her acting is so well executed because, believe it or not, she plays the frigid and innocent choir girl in American Pie. She plays a promiscuous teen who attracts Lester. After watching this movie you'll really notice just how skilled both Spacey and Suvari are in this movie. One issue I have is I feel the film should've gone for longer. I wanted more from the characters, more from the story, and more from Sam Mendes. I didn't feel 100% satisfied. Nevertheless, an incredible piece of work."

","Lester Burnham is a sniveling father that works a thankless middle class job and his wife Carolyn is unfulfilled by not living up to her full potential. Both of these facts are hidden by the rosy facade of suburban monotony they both have created for themselves. That is until each main character has a breakdown and they start breaking their respective molds. Lester decides he no longer wants to take orders at work and leaves on a quest to find what makes himself happy, including fantasies of his teenage daughters friend. Carolyn decides to meet a hotshot real estate broker for a meeting only to start an affair. From this point a complex storyline evolves with neighbors, wives and daughters creating turbulence in world narrated by Lester Burnham. American Beauty presents a darkly sardonic coming of age theme where Lester Burnham matter narrates his change. He blackmails his former boss for money to start his quest for meaning within his life. He buys a sports car he has always wanted and starts lifting weights to hopefully impress his uninterested wife. He takes a job flipping burgers to spend time fantasizing about Angela, his daughter Jane's high school friend. Jane herself is drifting away from Angela towards the mysterious neighbor Ricky Fits. Lester continues to narrate the changes each character stumbles through. Carolyn's ongoing affair enlivens her character to make bold choices in her life. She decides she can become successful selling real estate based on her fleeting affair with Buddy Kane. Jane Burnham involves herself with the shy but troubled Ricky who lives with his stern parents. His father a strict figure does not associate with the Burnham's newly found freedoms. These scenes describe the dark nature that belies the family. The cinematographer uses the color red throughout the film to portray passion, deceit, and death. The films red theme is pronounced and makes the use of a red rose noticeable in ads for the film. The cinematographer also uses wide-angle shots to allow you to see the full frame drama as is unfolds and close-up tight shots are few and far between. American Beauty follows a growing trend of films that show the fragile nature of suburban life and the dynamics of a dysfunctional American Family. Films like Thirteen, Thank You for Smoking, and Running with Scissors. Each of these films portrays a dark coming of age film, each with its own nuance."

But, in reality, Lester is having depression as he despises his job, quarrels with his wife, and has a daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), who can't stand him.<br/><br/>This film deeply highlights the negative effects of a broken-down and uncommunicative family in America, from Lester having an infatuation with Jane's friend, Angela (Mena Suvari), to Carolyn getting more obnoxious and distant toward Lester. Jane also developing a friendship with a shy neighbor Ricky (Wes Bentley), who lives with an abusive father, adds onto the chaos. All these course-of-events and the resulting consequences are depicted here, sometimes making your mind numb and making your jaw drop. The plot is full of tension and dark, dramatic moments from start to finish, and you'll also get some chuckles from its sarcastic and witty humor.<br/><br/>I thought, though, that many of the dialog is delivered very pretentiously or in a phony way, especially that of Lester and Jane. I guess that's how we get to sense their artificial chemistry and their relationship is really a front.<br/><br/>It's definitely not a film for the entire audience to see, as there are much adult themes such as language, sexual references, drug scenes and violence. Almost every bit of thing that makes a film rated R is contained in this movie and, sometimes, the film penetrates your thought so deeply you are left feeling depressed at seeing some of the worse in humanity and how insane or psychotic some minds of people can get.<br/><br/>I like the film for its suspense and cinematography, but I also feel disgusted at the over-the-top psychotic and immoral portrayal of the characters in this movie.

","American Beauty is a film quite unlike any other. Whilst many films rely on overly complex or hard hitting story lines, American Beauty maintains a relatively simplistic storyline. The incredibly simplistic storyline adds to the realistic, minimalist feel. The fact that the storyline is so simplistic is probably one of the main reasons people love it so much and can relate very easily to the characters. Many have felt like Thora Birch's character of Jane being insecure about their looks and trying to fit into society, while others have also felt like the outcast who doesn't quite fit into place in a society of others like the character of Ricky and almost everyone has felt like Lester trapped within society not wanting to obey the rules and feeling like they're not being heard or listened to.

","American Beauty is widely considered as one of the best films of the 90's and by some, one of the best films of all time. It has a great cast, great characters and superb acting. The story follows a year in the life of two families, living next door to each other, who appear to be different on the outside but extremely similar behind closed doors. One family appears as a classic appearing American, suburban family, a well off Mum and Dad and a spoilt moody teenager who seems to hate the world. Kevin Spacey plays Lester, a man who is suffering from depression and falls into a midlife crisis as he became infatuated in his teenage daughters new best friend (played by Mena Suvari). The family next door consists of an Ex-Marine father, his wife and their withdrawn, anti-social teenage son, who films his entire life on his video camera.<br/><br/>American Beauty is an emotional film that really makes you think about life and the day to day struggles that so many people in this world face. If you scratch slightly below the surface you see what families like this can be like. Kevin Spacey plays a fantastic role as Lester, his is able to get the message across that Depression is serious and that it is ruining his life but he also adds just enough humour, and he is a really likable character. The script is brilliant and makes telling this story very convincing and believable. Kevin Spacey also narrates the movie, I found this to be a nice touch and very effective as you hear what is going on inside the mind of a man suffering from depression.<br/><br/>Overall I would recommend this film to anybody looking for a movie with a strong storyline and convincing acting, if you are in a low mood and looking for a pick-me-up movie, then I would avoid this!<br/><br/>9/10"
"morlock9","8","0","2","21 December 2014"," Great performances marred by a politically correct ending.
","This is Redford's ""Ordinary People"" updated for a new generation with a lot of political correctness thrown in- which ultimately undermines the film's impact. Great performances are turned in by all. But while Spacey gets most of the credit, Benning and Suvari far surpass him for complex and powerful performances. Spacey is too cocky and glib to make a truly believable ordinary suburban dad. AB is the story of a family held together by spit and shoestring- trying to present an appearance of normalcy to the outside world and to themselves. When Spacey loses his job, he comes to grips with who he really is and what he really wants to make him happy- and we find the other characters in the film struggling with this same question. Added into the mix are the new neighbors. We get a drug-dealing voyeuristic neighbor kid (who looks a lot older than 18), his gun-obsessed closeted homosexual Marine father, and a depressed, catatonic mother. It's the Marine father who kills Spacey, after Spacey rejects his advances. Sure, a surprise ending, but in a very contrived and ""WTF?!"" way. I would bet that the original screenplay had Spacey being killed by the father of Suvari- who was outraged and thought that Spacey had defiled his daughter. This ending would have made far more sense. But we never do meet Suvari's parents- who could have been just as interesting and complex as Spacey and Benning were. In fact, it should have been Suvari and her family who lived next door, and forget about the Marines, guns, and homosexuality. Admittedly, it would have been a completely different movie, but maybe a better one. Still, a good flick and if nothing else see it for the brilliant triad performances of Suvari, Benning, and Spacey."

","Well the most beautiful thing about this film is it's name: so attractive and charming! The story is intriguing from the start when the main character tells us that he'll die in a year. And the finish of this film is also interesting filled with philosophical reflection about life and death. The story is rather ordinary about a man in his midlife crisis, his cheating wife and his passion for a teenage girl who is a friend of his daughter. It has some moments like seeing something unusual in ordinary things like plastic sac dancing on the wind and even a kiss between two men. Overall it's a nice film for watching when you need to relax and forget about your everyday problems, but there were better films in 1999. If you've never seen this film do yourself a favor and give it a try."

","It is truly a great movie.American Beauty focuses heavily on the notion that ups and downs are needed here. That thought is repeated again and again. But scene by scene, the film is full of its own brand of corrosive novelty, from the way Lester transforms himself in hopes of attracting the cheerleader to the revitalizing effects of Carolyn's acrobatic affair with a fellow real estate agent (a very smooth Peter Gallagher). As these characters struggle viciously -- and hilariously -- to escape the middle-class doldrums, the film also evinces a real and ever more stirring compassion. As it detects increasingly vital signs of life behind the absurd surfaces that Mr. Mendes presents so beautifully, the film takes on a gravity to match its evil zest. There's a haunting power to Lester's last narrative note to the viewer: that if you don't share the film's piercing vision of what really matters, someday you will."

","American Beauty is a film that needs to be seen. When it finishes, it will leave you in awe. It will make you feel something, that's for sure. It's just a unique and great film, and it is certainly one of my favourites. <br/><br/>American Beauty is a film that deals with a few different themes. It deals with the idea of not being happy with who you are. It deals with the theme of wanting to be unique. It deals with a lot of things that come about through everyday suburban life. It has a plot that feels relatable but also at the same time wild and slightly removed from reality. It's a drama but is full of dark humour, and it certainly benefits the film.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey gives a great performance. His slightly deadpan style of acting completely fits his character, who is completely sick of his boring life and wants to change things. Wes Bentley also gives a really good performance as the weird neighbour who films everything that interests him. It's an interesting cast of characters that are extremely enjoyable to watch interact, and they all work well.<br/><br/>The directing is also great, with some interesting dream sequences and scenes that just have a feeling that I can't quite describe.

","""American Beauty"" is a 1999 drama directed by Sam Mendes and stars Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, and Thora Birch. The film is about Lester Burnham, a depressed suburban father in a mid-life crisis, decides to turn his hectic life around after becoming infatuated with his daughter's attractive friend.<br/><br/>The film works as a satire about what life is like for those who think they live in the American dream, when in reality their lives are unhappy and only have materials to keep them satisfied. There are surprisingly a good number of well put together laughs due to the film's hyper realism presentation, and wit. Thankfully, the film knows when to utilize it's comedic element, and put in moments of drama.<br/><br/>Speaking of drama, it is also handled effectively. The film actually took me through a gamete of emotions, such as laughter, sadness, happiness, and even horror at a few points. There is a great deal of heartfelt moments in ""American Beauty"", that actually got a few tears out of me. This is amplified with Mendes fantastical direction, that had me absorb into the story and characters. The cinematography is gorgeous to look at, and the score is intoxicating.<br/><br/>There are films I can say is flawless from an acting perspective. This is one of them. All of the actors fully immerses themselves into their roles, and even actors that may not have a lot of screen time still manage to stick out, due to their dedication to their craft. The characters themselves are deep, and while they may exaggerate their personalities a bit, the movie still shows the darkest sides of their characteristics. However, they still feel human, and still drew me into their lives.<br/><br/>If I have to pick a show stealer in this brilliant cast, I'm obviously going to pick Kevin Spacey in his Oscar winning roles as<br/><br/>Lester Burnham. The heart and soul of ""American Beauty"", Lester is the only character in the film who tries to rediscover his freedom. He is funny, endearing, and ultimately tragic. He is a man who pay the price to achieve hope and freedom, which is the other characters may have found in the end. And Spacey performance makes Lester all the more endearing.<br/><br/>If I have any problems, I admit that while I understand the film went for an hyper realism route, there were one or two moments that I found it a bit grating. It did also make it harder for me to connect with a few of the characters to some extent, though I'm sure that repeat viewings will clear that issue for me.<br/><br/>Truth behold, there are few films that had glued to the screen recently in the way ""American Beauty"" has. From every single aspect to the writing, direction, performances, score, and etc. There is not one single film I have seen that has similarities with ""American Beauty"". It is one of the most engrossing movies I seen from 1999, and even with films I seen recently as well."

","It was love at first sight with this dark, twisted, witty film. American Beauty is a spectacular drama film brilliantly directed by Sam Mendes. The film displays some strong acting from it's actors. The story is quite strong here, and engages the viewer and you become suckered in by the solid acting and Mendes' strong direction. American Beauty is like a fine whiskey, you savor every minute of it, and you indulge in it's rich atmosphere it brings.<br/><br/>The performances all walk the line between parody and simple realism; Thora Birch and Wes Bentley are the most grounded, talking in the tense, flat voices of kids who can't wait to escape their homes. Bening's character, a real estate agent who chants self-help mantras, confuses happiness with success--bad enough if you're successful, depressing if you're not.<br/><br/>And Spacey, an actor who embodies intelligence in his eyes and voice, is the right choice for Lester Burnham. He does reckless and foolish things in this movie, but he doesn't deceive himself; he knows he's running wild--and chooses to, burning up the future years of an empty lifetime for a few flashes of freedom. He may have lost everything by the end of the film, but he's no longer a loser.<br/><br/>I think ""American Beauty"" is one of the most important films in cinema that will ever be released. The shots capture the elements needed in order to display the images of true human beauty, the dialogue is stupendously written, the tone of the film makes you want to cheer as tears role down your face in happiness, and the directing is indescribable beyond belief. In my opinion, ""American Beauty"" is one of the best films of all time!"

","Kevin Spacey is currently lighting up our TV screens as the slimy politician, Frank Underwood, in Netflix's excellent political drama, House Of Cards.

Considered by many to be one of the best actors of his generation, Spacey has starred in a number of fantastic films, and American Beauty just might be the best.<br/><br/>The story follows Lester Burnham, played by Spacey, a disillusioned 40 something living in suburbia with his overbearing wife, Carolyn and 17 year old daughter, Jane. Lester is an empty shell of a man – in the opening moments he laments that he feels dead already. It's hard not to feel sorry for him as his boss, his wife, even his daughter walk over him at every possible opportunity. This all changes, however, when he meets Angela, a beautiful blonde cheerleader who just happens to be Jane's best friend. Angela lights a fire in Lester's belly as he decides he has had enough of his mundane existence and embarks on a mid life crisis of epic proportions. <br/><br/>Released in 1999, American Beauty won a number of Oscars, including Best Film and Best Director for Sam Mendes. It is clear to see why, as he fills the screen with unbelievably gorgeous imagery, with a rose petal motif providing a lot of the beauty of the title. Alan Ball's script is also near perfect as it deconstructs the idea of the American Dream and exposes the cracks in American suburbia's perfect facade. <br/><br/>There are times when the movie strays into pretentious territory and Chris Cooper's character is disappointingly one dimensional when compared with the rest of the fine cast. But these issues are minor as Spacey's performance, gorgeous cinematography and a score which will give you goosebumps all combine to give you a Best Film which is truly worthy of the honour.<br/><br/>A hilariously scathing satire of suburbia containing one of Kevin Spacey's best ever performances.

","American Beauty is a story of a husband and father Lester Burnham, played by actor Kevin Spacey, who is dealing with issues of mediocrity, identity crisis and finding his true self, the real Lester. Lester's wife Carolyn Burnham, played by actress Annette Bening, doesn't respect him, and his daughter Jane Burnham, played by actress Thora Birch, thinks her father is nobody.<br/><br/>Lester begins falling and lusting over his daughter's friend Angela Hayes, played by actress Mena Suvari, after seeing her perform at a high school basketball game. Angela begins to flirt with Lester which only escalates the feelings he has for her. So now Lester is ready to make himself more appealing to Angela.<br/><br/>Lester then begins to get to the point where he is fed up with his mundane, ordinary life. He begins working out to try and make himself more appealing to Angela. He also begins smoking marijuana that he purchases from his new next door neighbor and classmate of his daughter, Ricky Fits, played by actor Wes Bentley, who is also attracted to Lester's daughter Jane. Ricky's father Colonel Fits, played by actor Chris Cooper, who has a prejudice against homosexual lifestyles, begins to suspect that his son and next door neighbor Lester, is having a homosexual relationship.<br/><br/>Then the story line gets deeper. Lester's wife, Carolyn who doesn't really respect Lester, then starts an affair with her business rival in the real estate business, Buddy Kane, played by actor Peter Gallagher. Lester was just about to get laid off, but instead he takes advantage of the efficiency expert, Brad Dupree, played by actor, Barry Del Sherman, and blackmails him for $60,000. After quitting his job, Lester takes a job at a fast food restaurant, and trades in his nice safe"" average Joe"" car, for a Pontiac Firebird.<br/><br/>This film tells a story from Lester's' point of view, but also does a spectacular job, of bringing out the character qualities and weaknesses in each character. This film intertwines the story of all the main characters, into a great overall story and a theme that we all can relate to, or maybe even have questioned ourselves at one point in time. Are you happy with your life? Do you feel like nobody? Do you wish you could get back to the younger you and lifestyle? If you had the chance to, would you go back to your teenage years, or at least live like it? This film brings all of these questions into perspective, and does it in a way that would make you ponder these questions yourself. A must see film! This film's theme of finding yourself, resembles the movie The Wood. Where actor Taye Diggs, whose character name is Roland, is having cold feet about getting married. But, after talking and reminiscing with friends he then figures out what makes him happy, his bride to be.<br/><br/>This film also has special effects that are not overbearing but help to relay what Lester is feeling at times.

","Spectacle's are clearly vulnerable to being enjoyed by the world and are easy to get access to. Seeing a firework show, looking at a beautiful person, enjoying the scenery of a mountain range, and seeing a world- series baseball game finish in an intense inning are all full of beauty in their own ways. What about the simple lives of people no matter how they live or act? Writer Alan Ball creates a masterpiece of writing about enjoying the simplicity of life and finding the beauty of every moment. Kevin Spacey gives a brilliant performance as Lester Burnham, a depressed middle-class American who is unsatisfied with his uneventful and crashing life. His relationships with his wife and daughter are strained and tense, his job causes him extreme stress and he has nothing to escape from it. The only sense of happiness Lester now gets is having interactions with his daughters beautiful friend that causes hope for Lester. Lester's wife Carolyn is played perfectly by Annette Benning. Carolyn is rather harsh and cold to Lester and is having an affair. Their daughter Jayne is constantly observed by their neighbor's son Ricky, who is very artistic and finds the beauty of absolutely everything in any shape, size, fashion or form. He is obsessed with Jayne and his motivations and love for her are interesting because deep down we all know how we have that urge to strive for our unrequited lovers even though most of us are too shy and fragile to face criticism. Ricky lives with his deeply anti-gay father who is cast perfectly as Chris Cooper. The more and more this story goes on, the less beauty we see. Then why is this film called ""American Beauty""? Because writer Alan Ball and director Same Mendes show how diverse and special each character is and show how dynamic and deep we all are on the inside. Sam Mendes portrays the middle-class American lifestyle brilliantly by not overdoing or forcing the look of the setting and coaching of the actors in the slightest. Instead we see the harsh reality of struggling lifestyles and how with love and inspiration our emotions can be changed in a snap. Mendes examines simple people and general people with feelings, sexuality, weaknesses, and motifs to show how each ordinary individual is in fact extraordinary and not at all simple or weak. What's really moving about ""American Beauty"" isn't just its classic acting and tremendous film-making, but rather the boundaries it takes. A somewhat quirky character ensemble and harshly situated plot end up leaving us to see how there is always a way out of negativity and that in order to achieve happiness we need to see the beauty everyday has no matter what is occurring at our lives. ""American Beauty"" is a beautiful and brilliant American film classic!"

The movie American Beauty is so many things on so many levels and what you get out of it has a lot to do with your own frame-of-reference for life. I imagine that you could revisit this movie at a different life period and see it from a different angle each time. I think it is an important film for people who get that there is something a little ""off"" about contemporary American life, particularly in the ""Anytown USA"" quaint American suburb. Things in suburbia and its' 360° radius are never quite what they seem, hence the tagline: Look Closer. I will never get tired of this film; it has so much to teach.

","Overall, I believe these themes were portrayed well through the action and characters. The message to love life and live honestly to yourself and others shone through. All of the characters are searching for a way to connect or to feel happy once again, and in harmony. Beauty can lead to happiness, if it is true beauty. Subsequent messages, such as acceptance of others, like homosexuals, came through as well. The joy, love, and passion for others and life in general is what this movie says to me, through its dialog, actions, framing, and technique. It is a strong commentary on what lost inside of us when we see things as beautiful that are grotesque in reality. It shows that we sometimes confuse beauty with ugliness, and completely miss the beauty altogether. Mundane living and unappreciation for the everyday deaden what is alive in us."

Like Lester who wants his freedom and sense of self back being infatuated to Angela is an indirect approach to admit his incompleteness . Angela is his symbol for change like we have a crush then we change for our crush but we realize our crush is just a symbolism of our subconscious longing for change . Our conscious want to see a concrete reason . Like Lester he realized that he wants to change for himself to have his own voice and not for Angela that's why he didn't have sex with her. He used weed as his antidepressant (g13) that's taboo but it helped him. He wants to see his own life ahead of him . Carolyn wants a picture perfect scenario she is a control freak because she can't control her own career that's why he controls Lester and Jane. She' always read inspirational books about career which made her expectations so high and reality so low. She loves gun because she can feel control. That's why she had an affair with Buddy an image of success but his crazy philosophy in order to be successful one must project an image of success makes him shallow. Angela wants to be a model but she hides something her insecurities like she says ""there is nothing worse in life than being ordinary"". Jane is insecure with herself that's why she wants a boob job but in her nudity scene it shows that she has an above average breast size. It's just a symbol of her longing for appreciation . Her friendship with Angela sucks her empty. Lester loves her but she thinks that Lester is a loser dad. Carolyn wants her to be gorgeous but she wants to be herself . There she found Ricky the most normal character he is happy for who he is . He doesn't need a gorgeous outfit because he has genuine beauty on the inside. But his dad Frank passed all of his insecurity to Ricky and his wife . His wife became catatonic but Ricky saw beauty in simple things like the plastic bag it was his coping mechanism . Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it and my heart is just going to cave in . Just profound really profound . And the ending where Lester found the real beauty behind things - his family . Jane found Ricky. Angela realized that she doesn't need to be a sexual object to be pretty. Ricky found the beauty in Lester's death he saw closure , happiness and contentment . Frank never accepted himself . Carolyn realized amidst all the power and money she wants ,he really loves Lester. Carolyn doesn't want to kill Lester she just wants to gain power but she realized Lester loves him even though she's ordinary. She woke up from the fact the she's a prison of her own unrealistic expectations which stopped her from being a great wife to Lester. We should look closer we will find beauty all around us .

","First: i usually don't give 10's for a movie rating, regardless how astonishing they are, my opinion is that this number 10 should be kept for that once-in-a-lifetime movie. Nor do I like to use superlatives, to the contrary. I have watched quite some 'classics' (gladiator, sin city, seven pounds, Forrest Gump...). All great movies, but still, they almost fade in comparison with the experience I had with this movie. But having watched 'American beauty' about 2 years ago, and still having it in mind as the greatest movie ever, i think it deserves my maximum vote.<br/><br/>Now let me explain why I think this movie is sublime. I'm not sure if I know the reason. I think the fact that I can't put my finger on why this is such a great movie is a contribution to it. OK, being frustrated for 2 years because I don't know the exact reason, I came up with things like 'it's the cynical character of Lester' and 'It's the message I get behind the story'. Among others, these are two reasons I adore this movie.<br/><br/>The main reason I think this movie is so good (good is a understatement), is because of the feeling I had when finished watching (watched it twice, had twice the same feeling). Up to today, I have this feeling. As it's a feeling, it's hard to fully explain but I can best describe it as a feeling of gratitude and optimistic insight. The insight that there are countless fabulous things happening every second. You might infer that I am a huge drug user, I can guarantee I don't do drugs, nor was I drunk before, during or after the movie. Still, I felt a special kind of euphoria after watching 'American beauty'.<br/><br/>If you're in need of a movie with meaning that's still funny at times (mainly cynical humor to my opinion), I'm begging you to watch it, no mistake."
"jul-kinnear","9","0","1","13 February 2014"," ""There is nothing worse in life than being ordinary.""
","Angela (Mena Suvari) says in American Beauty. The Academy Award–winning 1999 movie is about many things, but this is one of its strongest messages. The only thing it suggests more is that if you pull back the curtain on even, say, a seemingly perfect everyday suburban family, nobody is ordinary, normal, or boring. As the movie poster for American Beauty says, ""Look closer."" Which is what the film also does by giving us a not-so-common behind-the-scenes look at what it's like to be in the real estate world. <br/><br/>But first, the story. In American Beauty, Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a self-described loser. His Martha Stewart–like wife, real estate agent Carolyn (Annette Bening), and his gothy teenage daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), respect him as much as he respects himself: not at all. Lester is a wet blanket and a pushover. He is someone who describes his life as so dull and unsatisfying that he considers himself practically dead. That changes when he meets Jane's best friend, Angela, and a strong attraction sparks in him. Something awakens, and he begins to change his life around. In doing so, he sets things in motion (for himself and others) that snowball into the dramatic end of the movie.<br/><br/>As the film goes along, it does what its poster promised: it looks closer. It pulls away the layers of its characters. It shows them as more than just stereotypes. In particular, Carolyn — as a real estate agent — proves to be an interesting representation of our trade (more on that later). All characters are complicated and contradictory people, just trying to fulfill their desires by moving past the obstacles they face.<br/><br/>The fact that you can so easily take this message out of American Beauty is credit to Alan Ball (creator of Six Feet Under and True Blood), but also the actors' extraordinary work. What's hard to believe about American Beauty isn't just how good the performances are — it's how many good performances there are. Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey (both of whom won Oscars for their roles) especially stand out. They single- handedly carry (and pull off) the film's delicate back-and-forth between being very serious and darkly, maniacally funny.<br/><br/>A big reason American Beauty is so funny is because of how relatable it is. It plays out like a dark vicarious fantasy. Who hasn't wanted to break a little free from some of the rules and structures of everyday life? Who hasn't wanted to tell off their boss, or throw a plate of vegetables at a wall when they're angry? We laugh at the outrageousness of it all because there's a part of us that wishes we could ditch our inhibitions and do what we want, like these characters. Well, maybe not exactly like these characters. The lesson to take from American Beauty isn't that you should threaten your boss with blackmail to get a better severance package. But maybe stand up for yourself a little more so you get what you deserve in all aspects of life. And that's something not only that we can all relate to, but that's also probably good advice we all need to remember now and then.<br/><br/>Of course, for us, American Beauty is more relatable in some ways, given that Annette Bening plays a real estate agent. As was the case with Glengarry Glen Ross, American Beauty isn't necessarily a nice representation of our trade. That's partly because nobody is meant to come off looking very good in American Beauty, and partly because the movie is less interested in Carolyn the real estate agent than it is Carolyn the person. Still, while it might easy to write her off as a negative stereotype, it's worth heeding American Beauty's advice and look closer.<br/><br/>Stripped of all exaggeration, Carolyn does illustrate kernels of truth. For one, the scene where she prepares one of her listings for an open house shows how much hard work can go into this job. It also emphasizes something that's true of many jobs: if you're good at what you do, it looks easy to outsiders. But, of course, nothing is entirely easy. Enjoyable? Worthwhile? Absolutely. But a lot of work goes into making something seem perfect.<br/><br/>A lot of work goes into being a real estate agent in other ways too. Carolyn's competitiveness and mantras about projecting an image of success (or ""I will sell this house today!"") are extreme, but the relatable truth there is this: real estate professionals are often entrepreneurs who have to put in a great deal of effort to be successful and keep themselves motivated. Which is why Carolyn's eventual ""friendship"" (at first platonic, later more intimate) with Buddy the Real Estate King (Peter Gallagher) also rings true. Sure, real estate can be competitive, but there still can be a communal sense of mutual understanding — a sense that everyone is in it together.<br/><br/>While Carolyn may be a more relatable real estate professional than the men of Glengarry Glen Ross, there's one significant thing she shares with them: she never seems to place any importance on the people she's helping find her homes. She is so obsessed with the success of her career. That's it. But, as we said with Glengarry, that isn't to say American Beauty isn't a great movie. It's just not one that entirely represents what we do. But, unlike Glengarry, it does — in its way — give you a more behind-the-scenes look at the hard work, determination, and entrepreneurial spirit we put into helping people find their dream homes. Because for most real estate agents, the mantra isn't ""I will sell this house today."" It's ""I will help find someone a home today.""<br/><br/>http://juliekinnear.com/blogs/real-estate-American-beauty"

All relationships are doomed to either misery or outright failure, and this story almost followed that cold, hard truth all the way through to the resolution. Human sexuality is purely fueled by primitive biological drives, and built upon a foundation of mutual self-deception...sadly, this film had a chance to be nearly perfect by creeping right up to that fact, yet they backed away from it at the last moment."

","I saw American Beauty for the first time last night and I had no words when the film ended.I couldn't believe how someone could create something so ""spectacular"", so cleverly dark and funny.I came away from this film with a very unsettling feeling yet a feeling of gratitude for the world as well. To me there were multiple messages in American Beauty. There was the message of how the world is beautiful if you take the time to look at it,hence the video of the flying bag, and the message that we all get to a certain age and wish to go back to a younger time, a time of youth and having the feeling that your whole life is ahead of you. But you can view it and take away your own message. Everything about this film is top notch, including the performances, the writing and the cinematography. Kevin Spacey was beyond amazing in his role as lester. He embraced his character and acted it with such a natural air.Anette Bening was a sight to watch, as she performed with such talent and heart. The script was unbelievable, with every line, every movement meaning something.I couldn't believe it was Sam Mendes's debut feature film, as it was such amazing quality. American Beauty is a movie that will make you think, it will make you squirm and it will open your eyes, not just to suburbia but to the world as well."
"Leofwine_draca","9","0","4","8 December 2013"," Not quite up to the hype
","I saw this at the cinema back on first release. I remember there being a lot of hype back then, a lot of Oscar buzz, a lot of people saying it was the best film ever made. In many ways I believed them. 14 years later and I finally got a chance to rewatch the film. A lot of years and a lot of movies have passed by since then, and it's fair to say that American BEAUTY doesn't quite live up to all that initial hype. It's starting to date very slightly these days. It's still very good, but it's not quite the masterpiece I remembered.<br/><br/>What it is is an effective and extremely black comedy that attempts to skewer the typical, suburban American family. Of course, that conceit is highly familiar - DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES got eight or so years out of quiet and not-so-quite desperation - but American BEAUTY handles it with aplomb. It helps that the excellent Kevin Spacey takes the lead role, and nobody else could have quite grasped the intricacies of his character like he does. Plus he makes his deadbeat lead sympathetic despite his myriad flaws.<br/><br/>The movie works due to its quirky characters, all of whom are difficult to pigeonhole. The twists come a-plenty, particularly towards the climax, and all of them are decent, as are many of the players. I do find it something of a shame that Wes Bentley, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari and Chris Cooper never went on to make much of themselves given that they were all on very strong form here, although the less said about Annette Bening's histrionic turn, the better."

","I won't include any spoilers because I don't feel I need to within this review. The reason I personally adored the entire 'experience' of American Beauty was down to the sheer simplicity of it. From the soundtrack to the subtle narration to the unconvoluted plot. The themes within the movie were so basic yet so alien, they struck tender points within the way we view our own lives so profoundly that I was left dazed for several moments even after the film had finished.<br/><br/>It's one of those films where you don't feel the need to occupy yourself while watching it. It was as though the words were enough. I didn't touch my phone once and remained glued to the screen equally as strongly at the beginning as I was at the end. There's no massive fight scene or a tension build up, just a constant feeling of relation to the characters even though I myself had never been in the situations present. As always, Kevin Spacey provided an Oscar-winning performance which really made me fall in love with the entire moral of the story. The simple yet eloquent presentation of the ideas gave me certainty that this is a movie I could watch over and over again and still feel the same revelations I did the first time through.<br/><br/>Highly recommend it."

","American Beauty is one of the best movies ever made, it reflects the dark suburban life to us. What I loved most in this film is that it is down to earth, easy to relate to and anyone can relate to this film; whether he's a teenager, a business man, a general, a sci-fi geek, a suburban father or a farmer, since it simply reflects human emotions towards the viewer and in the end we are all human.<br/><br/>The plot of this film is AMAZING as we follow the life changing moment of the main character and witness his progress in being ""hot"" but even though we can see one element of his life improving, the writer also allows you to understand that other elements of his life are shattering. Another part of the story was uncovering the past of Ricky Fits when he and his family remain a mystery through the first hour of the film, the, slowly, we start to understand his past. The metaphors in this film were very smart and hard to understand.<br/><br/>The performances gave me a shell shock, they were extremely amazing, Kevin Spacey was at his best in this movie, but one thing I did not like was the casting for Angela, Mena Suvari wasn't good enough for the role. Mendes did a brilliant job directing this film he made me so focused with this film that I thought I was in the suburbs. Overall, this is for sure one of the greatest films ever made."
"nunofnobrega","8","0","1","5 July 2013"," American Beauty indeed
","I went into this movie thinking it would be another Hollywood clichéd uplifting and shallow story where the protagonist, after overcoming a series of obstacles at the last minute, finds himself better than ever before. But this outstanding movie is way past this. Even though the movie closes with a good feel, at the same time, it ends with a tragedy.<br/><br/>Moreover, the anti-materialistic message that is clearly seen in American Beauty is extremely thought-provoking. Believe me, you will reflect upon your own life after watching this picture and I hope you take a lesson with you. The way the capitalist system and American dream's flaws are portrayed here, under the spotlight of a single family, really makes you realize how 'things' are overrated and will not, alone, lead you to a happy and fulfilling life.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey's excellent acting also deserves to be mentioned. I was simply stunned by his performance. All in all, American Beauty, carrying its' 5 Oscars, is a classic and if you have not yet watched it then I don't know what are you waiting for."

","May Contain Spoilers. Please read at your own risk.<br/><br/>American Beauty is a movie I feel everyone should see at least once. Not only does it keep you guessing at what is going to be happening next, it also makes you feel some questionable emotions you never thought was possible from a seemingly harmless movie. The movie is centered around a man, Lester Burnham, and his family of interesting characters. His wife, Carolyn, is a Realtor who hates her life and their daughter, Jane, is also a depressed ball of teen hormones. Everything starts out looking very bleak for the family, who are so seemingly content on the outside, so they start making some changes. Not always are these changes for the best. The rest of the movie is a kaleidoscope of horrible decision making mixed with uncomfortable events that are almost too creepy to watch. <br/><br/>Lester and Carolyn's mid-life crises are a roller-coaster of emotions and they seem to take it to another level. After an unhealthy obsession with his daughter's friend gets too out of control, things really start to get uncomfortable and you can't seem to figure out what will happen next. I really have to say that I really enjoyed this movie as a whole. Not only was the acting absolutely terrific, but the scenes are seamlessly shot, cut and edited. The lightening and music provide the perfect subtle detail to every scene. <br/><br/>I will leave you with this: If you love crazy, roller-coaster of a emotions movie, you will love this one. If you're anything like me you will probably have more questions than answers and have to view it again, just to be sure you really saw what you think you saw! However, I will admit that I love Kevin Spacey and everything he does, so I figured I'd like this movie. I would most definitely recommend American Beauty to anyone and hope that my review will be helpful for anyone curious to seeing it!"

","Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a 42-year-old father, husband and advertising executive who are depressed and feeling like his life has hit a plateau and has no meaning. Lester's relationship with his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) is an ambitious realtor who feels that she is unsuccessful at fulfilling her potential and so she decides that an affair will give her that feeling of worth. Their 16-year-old daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is unhappy and struggling with her own feeling of self-worth and self-esteem. Introduce the egomaniac Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), Jane's closest friend from high school who becomes the center of Lester's new reinvigorated obsession. ""Both my wife and daughter think I'm this chronic loser,"" Lester complains. He is right. But they are not without their reasons. At an agonizing family dinner, Carolyn plays music that mocks every mouthful; the music is lush and reassuring, and the family is angry and silent. When Lester criticizes his daughter's attitude, she points out correctly that he has hardly spoken to her in months. It is here that you can really see what discord everyone in the family has for each other and how broken this family truly is. Then it turns to the relationship between Lester and what has become the center of his everyday life, Angela. It's not a perverse relationship between the two of them, though the movie may lead you to believe that to be true. The relationship is more about the yearning of youth, respect, power and beauty. The theme of this movie is the fact that the moment a man stops dreaming is the moment he petrifies inside and starts losing himself. It's all about finding something that makes you want to take that first step to make a change. The movie shows Lester's progression from sad sack to hard bodied, self-confident, man. A recurring motif in this movie is that of the rose petals which signify the sexual desire Lester has for Angela, though they cover her body parts which then lead to show that it isn't a sexual desire for Angela but more of a desire for change and youth. Finally, though Lester started a loser, and by the end of the film he has lost everything, he has won because he is a changed man for the better and no longer a loser."

","The film American Beauty was an amazing and beautiful film. It was an emotional psychological drama that kept you at the edge of your seat through out the entire film. It was about a typical American family who all had a dark side to them. They were all living a painful, sad, and depressing life with no real happiness in it at all. Kevin Spacey who plays Lester Burnham in the film is going through a mid life crisis. During his crisis he becomes completely obsessed with his daughter Jane who is played by Thora Burch best friend Angela Hayes played by Mena Suvari. While his wife Caroline played by Annette Bening who is also going through a major crisis. She plays as though she is happy with her life by walking around with a fake smile on her face but in reality she is completely unhappy. Than there is the daughter Jane who is depressed and completely insecure. She hates her parents and her best friend Angela who always rubs in her face how beautiful she is. Little does Jane know that Angela really is not as confident as she leads everyone to believe. She is suffering from insecurities also. Another character who is important in the film is the Burnham's neighbor Ricky played by Wes Bentley who is suffering from a tough family and psychological problems. The movie shows that it really is not easy to just walk around with a fake smile on your face everyday. You have to do something about your problems and make them right or they will not get any better. At the final minutes of the film everyone's problems just explode with crazy endings to all of the characters stories. The movie leaves viewers with many questions and many thoughts. I recommend the film to anyone! It was great and kept you wondering the entire time. It gets everyone hooked to a character and makes you feel the pain that they are going through. It is a must see that will get you to really think and question what really happened at the end of the film."
"BooChanan","10","0","1","27 April 2013"," Sam Mendes' stunning 'life' film
","I went into American Beauty with fairly low expectations. I had heard that the film had little plot and it seemed very sexual from the trailers and posters. My mind was blown! I understand why some people say that this film has not much of a story; it is a genre similar to Forrest Gump that I like to call 'life'. It just portrays emotions amazingly and cleverly shows the viewer how everyone has their secrets. The tagline is 'Look Closer' and that is what the viewer must do to connect with the characters. The film seemed like it may have very disturbing sexual themes; pedophilia being a part of the film. This, for me, wasn't that big of a deal. Yes, it has many sexual references but that is just a part of life and helps to capture this films emotion. Sex is about finding a person's beauty as is this film. It is truly an amazing experience with many plot twists at the end that it is hard not to cry. This film is executed amazingly with a great script, cinematography, acting (especially Kevin Spacey), music and plot and was an impressive directorial debut for Sam Mendes.<br/><br/>I cannot praise this film enough; it is hard to find a film with a real heart that the audience is always likely to connect with.<br/><br/>American Beauty: 10/10"

","Kevin Spacey superstar. I have hardly ever seen such an authentic performance. Although the plot becomes quite unrealistic, daily routine of a mid aged man can not be shown any better. It is as simple (and sad) as that. Annette Bening is outstanding as well. The painful pressure to be successful is perfectly played by her. And not to forget... Mena Suvari. Spectacular. I did not know her. I have seen her afterward in some other movies. But she was never again so damned pretty and innocent. American Beauty unmasks men and women and all our base drives. It is not very flattering but it is as it is. I love this movie. Every bit. Thanks for this excellent stuff."
"everyone-act-normal","Null","0","1","3 April 2013"," An American beauty.
","In our quest for the meaning of life, we seem to follow rules that society decides for us; the American Dream, an ideology that rarely needs an introduction, an ideology that has been around for years. Hollywood in its ever powerful influence surely plays a large part in its circulation, connotation, and popularity. Men and women searching for happiness and the American Dream, or the perfect life, will always have a secret to hide and I therefore invite you to ""look closer"" at American Beauty – one of my favourite films – so that you can witness Hollywood's rebellious example.<br/><br/>In a world full of misinterpretations of how people live their lives, and decisions we choose which guide us down saddening paths, should we not just stop for a moment and recognise that there's more to life than chasing what we believe to be happiness? A perfect example of looking at the world differently can be taken from American Beauty, in the scene where Rickey Fits describes to Jane why he videotapes everything he finds interesting;<br/><br/>""It was one of those days when it's a minute away from snowing and there's this electricity in the air, you can almost hear it. Right? And this bag was just dancing with me. Like a little kid begging me to play with it. For fifteen minutes. That's the day I realised that there was this entire life behind things, and this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid, ever. Video's a poor excuse, I know. But it helps me remember I need to remember Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world, I feel like I can't take it, and my heart is just going to cave in."" <br/><br/>Hollywood has glamorised the American Dream for many years; it's why it's called a Dream. It is an idea rather than a reality, and Hollywood utilises this idea because it is of course what people want, what people wish their lives were. However, at some point the Dream stopped being just that, it became a goal and the main focus of people's lives, and the once happy families began to fall into a deeply suppressed form of existence, a polished exterior with the once desire to be happy, now just an act.<br/><br/>What's so special about American Beauty is its ability to balance the portrayal of these ideas of happiness, and with that balance it's able to appeal to all levels of human behaviour. Lust, betrayal, love, repression, sadness, happiness and joy are all here in their various forms.<br/><br/>Carolyn Burnham, a struggling realtor, trying to live the suburban life and allowing others to believe she's living the American Dream through perfecting everything she does, of course eventually cracks under the repression and breaks free with an affair with Buddy King, her main competitor. Her daughter Jane Burnham is the wild card that forces her corrupted parents to finally look at themselves and see who they are. Her bluntness and ability to point out the elephant in the room provides Leicester and Carolyn the realisation that they've grown apart, severely. Now Leicester Burnham, a middle aged man, breaks free from his repressed way of life and begins his intense fascination over Angela Hayes, his daughter's school friend. His new approach to life is a controversial topic; there's always a right and wrong, but the line can be so transparent, you can sometimes walk straight over it.<br/><br/>I will not condone his lustfulness towards Angela, as it is of course inappropriate, but the release of joy on his face when he realises he can still feel passion? That is worth being discredited for. It is in that scene, where the rose petals begin falling on him from his bedroom ceiling that an innocent, boyish expression defines his release from a repressed lifestyle.<br/><br/>Throughout American Beauty many people watching find reasons to feel disgust and hate towards the characters in the film; they are flawed, but they are human, they are who we are, and we shouldn't be as closed minded as to simply look and see only what we want to see, or indeed, what we don't want to see. American Beauty is beautiful, it's the perfect representation of reality sealed with a Hollywood budget."

","I do not understand why American Beauty is not regarded by more as the greatest/favoritest/bestest movie ever.<br/><br/>The first time I ever watched it, after the dénouement, and as the Beatles' ""Because"" played at the end credits, I just sat there spellbound and transfixed, thinking, ""WTF just happened??""<br/><br/>A roommate of mine passed by the living room (where I was watching the movie) and asked, ""Oh was it good? Was it deep? Was it intelligent?"" <br/><br/>I must have just mumbled something in response. But what I was thinking afterwards was that you can't just characterize this movie as ""deep"" or ""intelligent"". This is one of the very rare precious gems that may be correctly described as ineffable. <br/><br/>This ineffability is all the more so, given the totally mundane and unexciting premise of a suburban family, consisting of a 40 something year old father in some sort of a midlife crisis, an unhappy wife/property agent, and an angsty teenage daughter. <br/><br/>The only way to do justice to this movie is to tell you to go watch it, if for some really odd reason you haven't already!"

","American Beauty has just made my top ten list of all-time favorite movies. I have rarely seen a movie that has such masterful filmmaking and one that plays with all your emotions all so perfectly during the running time of two hours. This is a perfect satire on American life and on the life of an ordinary family. What I liked is none of these characters are the villains, but they all are shown to have flaws and yearn for better things in life. This movie has the perfect balance of humor and drama and I was surprised how funny some scenes were.<br/><br/>This film happens to be the theatrical debut of Sam Mendes and he directed one dandy of a film. His film takes a look on the life of the Burnham family. This film looks at the dwindling marriage of Lester and Carolyn Burnham and the relationship of their daughter and the son of their new neighbor. There is also the relationship of that son and his father which is quite intense.<br/><br/>In order for a film like this to work, there must be marvelous acting. Kevin Spacey is a very gifted actor and he is the perfect guy for Lester. He truly gives a powerful performance from the moment his voice over starts at the beginning of the film. Annette Bening gives a great performance as Carolyn. I also loved Chris Cooper as the military neighbor. His scenes were intense to say the very least.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. This is somewhat of a satire, but realism is integrated in the movie. I loved the camera work in the film especially when the red flower petals are floating during some scenes. This is a true 90's masterpiece and I was hooked from the beginning to the end. These characters aren't bad people, but they were trying to have a better life and that I sympathize with them. I rate this film 10/10."

As any other review will tell you Kevin Spacey lusts after his daughter's school friend, gives up his job and goes back to acting like a teenager himself. Meanwhile his materialistic wife (Annette Bening) practices her work ethics, bonks king lounge lizard and fails to understand Spacey. Equally important is the story of their daughter, her friend and psycho-boy who lives next door with his own dysfunctional family.<br/><br/>As a piece of direction it is outstanding. The acting is both masterful and mistressful in equal proportions. It's gorgeous to look at. It's funny, sad, touching, sexy and downright brilliant. It is also, it has to be said, not half an hour too long! On this last criteria alone it should be awarded a full complement of Oscars right now. The nearest comparisons are ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"" and ""Blue Velvet""; it's mammothly better than the former and comes close to being as good as the latter.<br/><br/>Despite the dark dark currents that run through this film I found the overall effect quite uplifting and the downer of an ending made me feel very happy. I went to see this with my step-daughter and the truth of the film was enough to make that a slightly uncomfortable experience to be watching it with her which is absolutely the way it should be.

The husband and wife hardly talk, never have sex and basically hate each other. Their daughter hates her father and hardly talks to her mother. She also feels very left out and hardly has any friends. It is basically their lives and how it all falls apart.<br/><br/>I felt it had a very Cohen Brothers feel to the movie, but they didn't have anything to do with it.

He becomes obsessed with his daughters best friend and tries to impress her. His wife is played by Annette Bening. She is great in this. Especially when she is breaking down and going mad. She really played the role well. Their daughter is played by Thora Birch. This was a perfect role for her. She has always got a moody looking face and seeing as this character hardly ever smiles it works very well. Her best friend is played by Mena Suvari, who is the girl all over the poster. She plays this high school cheerleader who flirts with Lester through the movie.<br/><br/>The story was really good. There were some moments in the film I was not expecting which surprised me and some great comedy moments.

Kevin Spacey does his job with expertise as a man who wants more out of life and will do anything to feel new. Some people call that a mid-life crisis, this films shows it as something else. ....Look Closer (See what I did there). Even Annette Bening did as solid job playing as a prude of sorts who demands perfection and will get it anyway possible. Granted the script isn't the greatest in the world (Magnolia should've won in that category) it fit well into what Sam Mendes wanted and in the end, you got an excellent film with great acting and a message that tells people to not look at what you see at face value whether it's for a family, a business or kids at a high school."

Suddenly, he attempts to kiss Lester, revealing that his homophobic personality is a mere facade. Lester pulls him off & Frank leaves without another word. Lester finds Angela crying on the stairs. One thing leads to another and Angela is soon in his arms. Angela reveals that she is nothing like her projected slutty image & is a virgin. Lester suddenly sees her as a daughter & realizes that he has been wrong in lusting after her. He embraces her like a child. She leaves a content Lester whose life has now come to a full circle. He feels no remorse but only gladness at spurning the object of his desire. He gazes contently into a family photograph. A barrel of a gun appears behind his head. A shot is heard and his blood is splattered on the wall. The reaction of the each of the rest of the characters is shown, when the shot rings out. Frank is revealed to be the killer.The deceased Lester in a final voice-over sees his life is flashing before him.His dying thoughts revolve around his childhood memories, Carolyn and Jane. He has no regrets & finds hard to be angry with so much beauty in the world. He is grateful for every moment of his short life. <br/><br/>Look closer says the film's caption. The Burnham's house is full of smiling,happy family photographs but the house is anything but that. The prosperous neighbourhood is eerily silent,whether it be the sombre atmosphere in the Burnham household or macabre in the Fritts one. Behind smiling faces lies just contempt or insecurity. The film can be interpreted in innumerable ways- as a demythifier of happy suburbian middle class life , an attempt to find life's meaning, a person's wish to break free out of a mundane,materialistic existence or there's more to life than stuff & status symbols like job or status or how everyone lives a fake life. Carolyn's fake self esteem is a cover to hide her dissatisfaction & hate for her job. Frank's homophobia is a cover to hide his own homosexual tendencies. Angela's dirty talk and loose image is a pathetic attempt to be seen as a glam doll. Jane while projecting herself to be aloof suffers from low self esteem and feels jealous of the extrovert Angela.The only person content and happy in the end is Lester, inspite of his life's journey coming to a cruel and abrupt end. <br/><br/>Sam Mendes couldn't have asked for a better debut in Hollywood, with his film sweeping all the major awards, including five Oscars. His direction is flawless, as he peels away the pompous layers of each character to reveal their vulnerable selves. Yet it stands out in the fact that he has avoided sugarcoating or giving the film a happy ending, in order to give the real message of the film- Ultimate freedom comes at an ultimate price.<br/><br/>The film belongs to Kevin Spacey. As Lester Burnham, he has portrayed beautifully a vulnerable & ordinary person prone to weakness & temptation yet remains a good human being who only wants a more dignified & fulfilling life. Annette Bening is excellent as the materialistic Carolyn .Chris Cooper is brilliant as Frank Fritts. The same is applicable to the rest of the cast. There is beauty all over this film.<br/><br/>Watch. And look closer."

","Lester Burnham, a man not unlike most. A man beaten down by life. A less than perfect marriage, a strained and disappearing relationship with his daughter and a dead-end job. Kevin Spacey is fantastic playing this character. From the beginning of the film he shows us perfectly, how his life is, just by his looks and his mannerisms. Annette Bening is also great as Carolyn, his wife. Sam Mendes (Director) does it again. After seeing both American Beauty and Road to Perdition I am truly a fan. Both films shine a light on people that goes deep down into the core of their humanity. American Beauty shows us all that appearances can and most often are deceiving and that to really know anyone you must take the time to ""look deeper"". I almost forgot to mention Chris Cooper, what a joy it is to see this man work. As Frank Fits he adds yet another perfect layer to this already rich tapestry."
"bjbonkowski","Null","0","1","13 September 2012"," The film American Beauty is about a man by the name of Lester Burnham,
","The film American Beauty is about a man by the name of Lester Burnham, played by Kevin Spacey, whose life has become stagnant and his marriage has become a depressed life of lies. The film takes the audience through the next few days of Lester's life where he does everything possible to get his life and dignity back after being stuck in a loveless marriage and a job that gives him no satisfaction. Lester's wife, Carolyn Burnham is played by Annette Benning; his daughter Jane is played by Thora Birch; and her friend Angela, who becomes the center of Lester's infatuation is played by Mena Suvari. Each of these actors fits well into their characters and portrays the theme of the film perfectly.<br/><br/>The theme of the film is that happiness can be found by looking closer at the things and people around you; seeing people for who they are and material possessions for what they are. This theme is portrayed through the eyes of Lester and is highlighted by the depression he struggles through from the beginning of the film. When Lester finally finds something that in his depressed eyes is worth being happy about, which is Angela, the director focuses on this through the length of the film. To emphasize Lester's direct thoughts when he is fantasizing about Angela there is a change in the sound during that particular scene. During moments of Lester's thoughts the sound includes a few low ambient sounds with a very low tempo. This creates a very surreal feeling that takes the viewer inside the thoughts of Lester.<br/><br/>Lester's depression is used as a motif that further emphasizes the overall theme of the film. Without the depression it is unlikely that any of the events would have taken place as Lester likely would have felt much happier in this marriage from the beginning. This is also noticed when viewing the character of Col. Frank Fits, played by Chris Cooper, and his wife Barbara Fits, played by Allison Janney; these two have some obvious problems in their marriage that do not become inherently clear until the end of the film when we find that Frank is gay and has been hiding this his entire life. In doing so he has pushed away both his son and his wife. As with Lester and his family, who could have had a happy marriage if they each could have looked beyond each other's facade and saw who they were inside; so to could Frank and his wife had been happy, even if that meant they were no longer married because he finally admitted he was gay. We see this same scenario present in many films. For example, in Gran Torino, though having a bit of a different theme, we see a character in this film disliking people because of their race, which in turn causes that person great anger; however, toward the end of the film he has seen these people for who they are and enjoys moments of happiness for the first time."

","One of the most obscure dramas I have ever seen, but ""American Beauty"" is a powerful film that puts our lives into perspective. This film tells the story of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey, winner of the 1999 Best Actor Oscar) who feels that his life has been a sham for the last several years and resolves to turn his mediocre life around after developing an infatuation with his daughter (Thora Birch)'s best friend (Mena Suvari). The acting in the film is beyond compare to any other drama that runs on the same lines. Playing Carolyn Burnham, Spacey's cinematic wife, is Annette Benning, who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, performing as a woman worn down by her failure to keep her business afloat with a family that is breaking apart at the seems.Spacey's performance, which garnered him his second Oscar, is a real tour de force; a powerful, slightly comedic and serious acting combination of unmatched talent. The film ended up bringing tears to my eyes by the climax where I could sense there was unease in the air, but did not expect the tragic ending that came. A pure thrilling drama, ""American Beauty"" wills the viewer to 'look closer.'"

","As the title suggests, this one of a kind movie so blew me away with its artistic vision and masterful camera work that I will run out of adjectives in this review to describe it.<br/><br/>From start to finish, the film took us on a journey into the life of Lester Burnham (played by the ever reliable and excellent Kevin Spacey), through his mundane 'ordinary' life and how it had extended and settled over his whole family, until his meeting with his daughters friend Amanda (played wonderfully by Mena Suvari). Take note of that word ordinary, as this movie was anything but. Sam Mendes takes us on an incredible journey, as Lester finds his whole life and spiritually revitalized by his infatuation with Amanda. Incredible performances from Spacey and Suvari, coupled with a strong supporting cast, really fed into the movies message. <br/><br/>However, despite the wonderful performances from the cast, it is the beautiful cinematography and a wonderful use of colour (keep and eye out for the symbolic red door and red roses) that aids the story throughout, and transforming this potentially 'ordinary' movie into something truly beautiful.<br/><br/>A final special mention goes to the soundtrack, which quite simply, astounded me.<br/><br/>Very easily one of the best movies I've ever seen, and an instant classic."

","I liked it, but I didn't. It was completely different to what I thought it would be. I thought it would be a dramatic and intense film about an American teenager, but it was a quirky, weird film about someone's father having a crush on his daughter's hot friend. But I did enjoy a film that was different to the rest I had seen.<br/><br/>My Favourite Character was Ricky Fits. (Wes Bently) This guy was my favourite character by far. He was introduced as this creepy guy, who would film the family or whatever. We got the impression that he was mentally insane but as we learned more about him, we realize that our initial judgement was horribly wrong. He ended up being this drug dealer who worked numerous jobs to hide the fact he dealt drugs from his strict military type dad and he was this wild free guy. He ended up dating the daughter in this film and befriending the father as well. He just seemed like a likable guy and he was an unusual character.<br/><br/>I would recommend it to people over 16 and people under 30. It's a very quirky film that you will either like or hate. I would be very selective as to who I would recommend this to.<br/><br/>This movie was different. However it was fantastic the way it changes the audiences expectations throughout the film. We think one thing, then something else happens. So we think another thing, something else happens! I felt like I was on a ride when I watched the movie and did not know what to expect, it stays that way till the very end of the movie. It was a well crafted unique film that will be a masterpiece to some, and a shoddy film to others."

","In the film American Beauty, directed by Sam Mendes we are treated to a feast of pietistic crow. It is not an accident that the 1990's should end with a film such as American Beauty any more than the 1980's ended with the War of the Roses by Danny DeVito. While conveying the same happily married couple coming of age theme, the former draws on the brighter side of darkness, while the later does the opposite. The 1980's celebrating the excesses of life while the 1990's celebrated, if not the simplicities, at least a faith in romance life might bring. American Beauty opens with Lester Burhnam, played by Kevin Spacey, giving a voice-over narration of the any man's life, on any man's street, in any man's house. We quickly learn that like so many of his brethren, Lester is bored, unhappy, and uninterested in his work, his family, his life. Predictably, none of his society is much interested in him either. His wife Carolyn, played by Annette Bening, is bitterly unhappy too, but unaware of this fact. Their daughter Jane, played by Thora Birch, is just another unhappily and unaware teenager. Unlike so many of us, Lester actually try's to change his life. While his daughter and wife unwittingly change around him, he consciously makes the attempt. To his complete amazement, and ours too, it works out. In an appropriate early scene we watch the unhappy couple approach Carolyn's real-estate idol Buddy Kane played by Peter Gallagher. The camera appears perched above Kane's head as the couple approaches as if they are paying homage to their better. We later note the transition as we watch Lester, working out regularly now, pose naked and unashamed in his garage. Lester's obsession with the teenage girl Angela played by Mina Suvari, is flaunted as the central point of the film. However, to believe his grasping at fading youth is nothing more than a Lolithian fantasy, is to miss the growth he, or any man might still achieve with what is left of life. Lester does grow, and in his final scene with Angela we witness just how much. But like the film, life is often very painful and difficult to watch. Carolyn's sycophantic homage at a lunch with Kane is far more painful to watch than her later indiscretions. Spacey's deadpan delivery of Lester's resignation at work would be hilarious or horrifying, if not so surreal and convincing. Lester is believable, not because he is so singular but because he is so familiar, as is every person on his quiet little street. In stereotyping life in the suburbs at the end of a century, American Beauty manages to defy caricature. We want Lester to succeed in his quest for relevance even as we know the anguish it brings to the world around him. He is the man who does what we should expect any sane 42 year old man do. He does what we all long to do. But we will not, and we know we will not. We will choose not to grow not only because it will hurt those around us, but because even as we relate to every circumstance in Lester's life, we still envision ourselves better than him. We will get through life without the pain, and without the guilt and still claim relevance in the end. Watch this film, and then decide for yourself."
"Marc_Israel_365","10","0","1","28 May 2012"," Is this your suburbia? is this your life?
","A mid-life crisis never seemed so pathetically intriguing. Drawn to the message of personal evolution like a proverbial moth, I managed to overlook the crude aspects of most of the characters and focused on each of their personal crisis. Kevin Spacey delivers the underdog performance you'd expect, but Annette Benning's portrayal of the dominant wife in distress was Oscar worthy. There are flawed characters to relate to for everyone and, therefore, accessible to all. While what we desire differs intensely, how we hold our cherished prizes, once attained, shows our character, and therefore our souls' keeper. While beauty may not be meant to be possessed, it remains uniquely personal as is this movie."
"afilmaday","9","0","1","10 May 2012"," Deserves all the awards it got...
","This modern classic is difficult to define or summarise for the overlapping themes keeps film fans and historians forever pondering, analyse and interpret. Philosophical ideologies are presented with its ever questioning of conventional beauty, the contemporary need for materialism and the uncontrollable nature of mankind's urge to conform. The spiritual and emotional imprisonment, numbness and sedation that Lester endures is what many of us can identify with, this yearn to break-free, rebel against mediocrity and relive adolescence to find oneself. It questions the stance of success, is it financial or personal? Does ambition lead to greatness? Teenage angst is conveyed as significant to the person as the more mature themes. Angst, insecurity and identity are the groundwork for adulthood for if it were to trivialise Ricky, Jane and Anegla's journeys, their own personal searches for acceptance and understanding, then it would risk self- contradicting Lester's rebellion as hypercritical and, snobbishly speaking, superior.<br/><br/>During my personal pondering, I began to seek not only these deeper understandings but more importantly the root to all these issues. The tag-line itself ""look closer"" could be a hint.<br/><br/>We, as the spectator, must view this not as a reflection or an alternative portrayal of middle-class suburbia but as a satirical fantasy; Lester's postmodern opening narrative ""in less than one year, I'll be dead"" and the camera swooping over his painfully average suburban neighbourhood indicates this is not natural storytelling. Throughout, its cinematography is conveyed in a dreamlike state, even the shift between reality and Lester's sexual fantasies are only distinguished by a shift in tone and music – during the cheer-leading scene, the dance is personalised and slowed down during the fantasy, juxtaposed against the upbeat showcase in reality; during the bathtub scene, the steam conveys eroticism to contrast Lester's reality in a cold, sterile bed with his wife. Lester is an anti-hero, doing what we all wished we could do; blackmail his boss to leave his confined vacuous career, stay at home, get high and listen to classic rock, and have a job with minimal responsibility.<br/><br/>Now, the root to every issue here is the danger of repression, a dual battle between personal freedom and the necessity of acceptance; for humans it's imperative to adapt and blend with its surrounding environment. Lester believes he has discovered his individuality, but in the third act it becomes apparent his behaviour, the working-out, drinking beer, owning a sports car and lusting after adolescent women are all the stereotypes of being a man, which is why he does not take Angela's virginity nor openly spew his own hang-ups on Angela when she asks, ""How are you?"" He simply says, ""I'm great!""<br/><br/>Carolyn works as the polar opposite, her addiction to fit-in with society's norms without ever confronting her banal existence (elevator music at the dinner table), her deep flaws (she never accepts Jane has issues with her, too) or her negative emotions (overt when happy but forcibly shouts and slaps at herself when sad).<br/><br/>To conclude it conveys a strong message about the destructive consequences of repression, the ugly actions it manifests when left to fester and beauty is subjective not objective. Every Westerner needs to watch and understand this movie.<br/><br/>American Beauty only works with a stellar cast of strong acting, a solid naturalistic script and music which plays a balancing act between reality and dreams. No minor character is stock, every moment is shot and performed with the height of sophistication and it's apparent as to why Spielberg called this upon initial viewing, ""you've created a masterpiece.""<br/><br/>For more, check out anyfilmaday.blogspot.com"

","The moral and ethical simplicity of American Beauty is absolutely stunning seeing as it such a powerful and moving film. It is dark, yet it shines a light on the social misfits of America, those embodying a person they are dissatisfied with, and those feeling worthless or unwanted. It is a tragedy in some sense, but it is also a very poignant satire on the modern American suburbia. If you're one of the many misfits in the world, American Beauty is your shoutout.<br/><br/>The plot is defined by the film's abundance of interesting and versatile characters, almost all of them stuck in a life they do not want to live. Our lead character is Lester Burnham (Spacey) a forty-two year old magazine writer, entering a midlife crisis and occupying an incorruptible hatred for his job and the ignorance possessed by his wife Carolyn (Bening) and daughter Jane (Birch). ""I'll be dead in a year"" claims Lester in the first few moments of the film. ""In a way, I'm dead already"" he will go on to say.<br/><br/>Tired of the trite and ordinary life he is living, he gets a curveball when he meets Jane's best friend Angela (Suvari), an unrealistically attractive teenager, promiscuous and blunt in her dialect and fashion. Lester is shamelessly smitten with her upon their first encounter, and Angela knows it all too well. She treasures the idea that other men fantasize about having sex with her, despite having no prior relationship or knowledge. She feels it will only assist her career as a model. Pay close attention to the scene in the gymnasium. It is rather detailed and cinematically intelligent.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Carolyn, a real-estate agent, has begun her rebellion by flirting and dancing with her main competition. Buddy Kane (Gallagher), a self-righteous, cocky man who gives her what her husband can't; safety, comfort, relaxation, and sex. A lot of it. Lester's rebellion starts when he quits his job and takes about eight steps down to the world of a fry-cook at a fast food joint. Jane's story of rebellion involves Ricky (Bentley), her neighbor who continues to videotape their interactions and spy on her persistently. At first, she is irritated, but begins to see Ricky for what he really is worth. He admires beauty in the way we all should. He sees simplicity as a treasure and feels it is taken for granted far too much. His upbringing has been rather heavy with an abusive bigot for a father and an uninvolved caricature for a mother. Not only is Ricky a passionate humanist and realist, but an avid drug dealer and pot smoker. There is a great scene in the film where him and Lester cut loose and smoke a joint together. This is where Lester's tale of rebellion and lawlessness comes into play.<br/><br/>Over the years, American Beauty has been interpreted a number of different ways by a number of different people. It's almost as if the film occupies too much ambiguity, but it's subtle and reclusive in its efforts, making the film seem so basic and linear. I believe it is not only a tale of rebellion, but a tale of life appreciation and a reiteration of the moral ""Carpe diem."" Upon finishing the film, I was distinctly reminded of the quote from Ferris Bueller's Day Off ""Life moves pretty fast. You don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."" We are constantly rushed, hurried, and flustered everyday, we hardly appreciate the serene and intricate aspects life throws at us. ""Who has the time?"" we might ask ourselves. American Beauty shows us it's the most simplistic things in life that are worth appreciating. Like a paper bag floating aimlessly in the air because of a modest wind gust. There is yet another wonderful shot in the film where Ricky is shooting a video through Jane's window. Angela is seductively dancing to taunt and satisfy him, but the camera zooms past her and in on a reflection of Jane's sad, lonely face. Rarely can a film accompany beautiful loneliness, but somehow, director Sam Mendes did in an earnest way, without being cheeky or bombastic. It's so crafty and subtle you may have missed it.<br/><br/>Another moral I can find is the isolation and imprisonment many of the characters feel. In one scene, very early in the film, we see Lester masturbating, enclosed in the shower. ""It's the brightest part of my day"" he states, but is it because he is providing himself with pleasure or because he's alone and safe? One shot I missed when watching the film was the scene where Lester's reflection in his computer screen looks as if he is imprisoned and sheltered from the real world. This is the part of American Beauty where it is keenly depressing. The three main emotions I felt during the film were happiness, depression, and vaguely present optimism. We already know the conclusion, but we can only hope we are wrong.<br/><br/>American Beauty is exactly what it is. A beautiful, heartwarming drama, providing us with witty, affectionate characters, a slick script, and exquisite directing and cinematography (credited to the late Conrad L. Hall). It is a drama of integrity, appeal, intelligence, soul, and humanism. Why can't they all be this wonderful? Starring: Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari, Chris Cooper, and Allison Janney. Directed by: Sam Mendes."

I have read a few reviews about this movie--and I know we all have our own views. I don't think it is about relationships, or individuals. The ""look closer"" message is the key. Its a bit like Mulholland Drive --not really complex. If we all looked closer perhaps we would all see the beauty in things like dancing plastic bags. Or (as Ricky does near the end of the movie).....he sees beauty in blood pouring out of Lester Burhams head (Kevin Spacey). We can talk about the neurotic Carolyn , the mis-shaped daughter , the lost in space friend , the violent father---and on and on and on. This is fundamentally a beautiful movie. We are asked to ""find all that beauty in the world"" We are asked to --LOOK CLOSER. This was Sam Mendes first movie.

","""American Beauty"" Lester Burnham the lead character played by Kevin Spacey is a 40 something guy who is experiencing a midlife crisis, he seems bored and pessimistic. Lester is married to Carolyn (Annette Bening) who is somewhat of a perfectionist on the surface she appears to have it all together, but inside she is falling apart. Lester also has a teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch) who is also going through a difficult phase; she's insecure, and unhappy with herself and her parents. Jane's best friend Angela (Mena Suvari) is beautiful and relies solely on her looks to get through life. Lester has a crush on Angela and fantasizes about being with her, because of this crush Lester starts behaving strangely he's working-out and making other drastic changes to his life. Meanwhile the Burnham's have new neighbors the Fits family. The father Colonel Fits is a ex-marine he is very rigid and not very tolerant of people who are different from him, he has a teenage son Ricky who seems to be the target of most of Colonel Fits aggression. Ricky is a wannabe film maker and drug dealer who seems preoccupied with beautiful things.<br/><br/>The common thread that runs through the lives of each character seems to be discontentment; each character seems to be in search of something be it happiness or just the freedom to be themselves. In America we have the freedom to pursue happiness, but so many of us are unhappy. By all appearances the Burnham and Fits seem to be typical American families but behind closed doors they are restless and dissatisfied with their lives. Lester feels useless and has become complacent and I felt that his greatest desire is to feel again; to feel alive, and be relevant to those around him. Carolyn in her effort to be perfect has completely lost touch with the woman that she used to be. She wants those around her to view her as self-assured and poised, but inside she is slowly unraveling at the seams. Jane is a typical insecure teenager with not so typical parents; she is embarrassed by her Father's (Lester) abnormal fixation on her best friend Angela. Angela enjoys the attention from Lester, because her entire existence is based on others perceiving her as beautiful. The family next-door is headed by a controlling, narrow minded, militant father (Colonel Fits) who's stern views and neo-Nazi approach makes life very difficult for Ricky his teenage son; who seeks to escape the reality of his father's anger by the use of drugs and by what seems to be an unconscious decision to only look at life through the lens of his camera.<br/><br/>The movie ""Gran Torino"" has some of the same common themes; the characters had preconceived notions about people who were different than them. There was also the search for purpose and relevance. The movies both had teenagers in search of their own identities, separate from their parents. In several of the scenes the lighting was directly focused on one individual character a lot like a spot light. In one particular scene Lester and his wife are at Jane's school watching her performance; this is when his infatuation with Angela first started. During the girls performance the music tempo slowed and everyone in the room disappeared with the exception of Lester and Angela. The light was shining directly on Angela and the camera was going back and forth from Angela to Lester as she danced; this was a great use of the director's interpretive point of view. The director wanted the viewer to feel the intensity that Lester was feeling as he imagined that Angela's performance was just for him; his very own private little show. Also I found the camera shots from Ricky perspective unique' whenever he was looking at the world through his camera the shot appeared to be a little fuzzy to give the viewer the feeling of looking at the world through the lens of a camera. The theme is a common theme of many American lives. Ultimately we all want to feel happiness and relevance, but we often get caught up in our daily lives and lose site of what's really important in life, only to wake up one day and realize that time has gotten away from us and we haven't truly been living at all; just simply existing and going through the motions."

Jane falls in love with Ricky (Wes Bentley), the boy next door who is also misunderstood by his parents and others. I really did not like the long recordings that Ricky did throughout the film, although the recordings were definitely necessary in regards to what he saw as beautiful, I did not think that they needed to be so long and occur so frequently throughout the film.<br/><br/>The film puts a twist on the meaning of beauty and death through symbolic messages, such as the color of red. Red roses and a red door are only two of the many symbolic messages that are displayed in the film. There were several images that could be disturbing to some, but all in all Sam Mendes had a great message to viewers. The theme can be defined by the following; never underestimate the power of revenge, enjoy the simple things in life; because they are beautiful, and live your life to the fullest because you never know when it may end."

His wife Carolyn played by Annette Bening is upset that her family is not perfect and she wants to project that they are. Lester's daughter Jane Played by Thora Birch is upset that her father is not involved in her life and he has not talked to her in a long time about anything. The theme of the movie is a distorted view of the grass being greener on the other side. They each want something different in their lives and want things to suddenly change. They think life should be more exciting and fulfilling. Throughout the movie they change their life styles dramatically to try to create excitement. The father quits the job he hates and does what he did in a time in his life when he was happy, which was working at a fast food burger joint. He starts smoking pot and working out to get girls like he use to when he was in high school. The mother starts having an affair with the person she thinks is living the perfect life she wants. She starts a new hobby of shooting guns as well. The daughter starts dating the new neighbor kid, Ricky Fits played by Wes Bently which is a bit weird and she believes he understands her world. They boy is also the fathers drug dealer, but it is kept secret from the rest of the family. The acting done by Kevin Spacey is very good. He shows lots of emotion from his character. You really feel the sadness in his life. The director takes long close up shots to show that emotion coming from Kevin. The lighting is very natural and some scenes go all weird with sound and distorted images, but that is just the effect they use to show the Kevin Spacey""s character is fantasizing. This movie touches home probably with a lot of people because the theme is universal. While watching the movie I could not help but compare my life to Lester's. I did what he had done and quit my job to return to school and try to get a job doing something I like doing. I think it is important to do something you like doing and to never give up trying to reach that goal."

","This review is over a decade late, but I was recently thinking about my initial feelings when I saw the movie in the theater. I couldn't understand why everyone was so taken by it - and especially why they found it it uplifting. It's a strong movie, compelling, though provoking, but disturbing. <br/><br/>The only likable character in the movie gets killed, pretty much as soon as he, belatedly, gets his sh-- together. (Not a spoiler - he tells you so in the beginning.) And everybody else's lives are pretty much screwed by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>(Did other people actually like the amoral drug dealer kid, who only sees beauty in death? Or the spoiled self-absorbed teenage girl?)<br/><br/>The movie's message was well-taken, if not new: Carpe diem, and don't end up like these losers."

","Really, what a beauty. I enjoyed Kevin Spacey before I came to see American Beauty. Here in his dead end role he is absolutely brilliant and so is the script. For those who think life is going the wrong way, here they may find comfort watching AB and realise that things can be far worse! In the leading role he find himself totally disconnected from his wife in a midst of a kind of artificial living style where he seems to have lost his identity and become just an accessory he finally shake it off and start a new life for himself. His teenager daughter also disconnected but really more like any one of her age unwillingly introduces her friend to him also contributing to his ""rejuvenation"" However this friend may not be all what she seems to portray. His daughter also enters in a relationship with an unusual neighbor who himself has an unusual relationship with his unusual family. And this is all the unusual beauty of American Beauty. I would not say this is for everyone especially those not completely at home in the western society, or those being very sensitive to certain moral issues. I found it to be very honest with its sarcasm in exploring situations that some of us will recognise as real."
"The-Sarkologist","9","0","2","23 September 2011"," An outstanding movie looking at the mid-life crisis
","This is one damn impressive movie. The advertisement caught me at first - a single rose draped across the naked belly of a woman, and then Triple J gave it a very high rating. At first I thought it would probably be a simple feel good movie, but it is far from that. In fact it is a very intelligent and deep movie with lots of imagery and a deep theme. The movie is about a pathetic man named Lester. He is in a boring job with a wife that cares little about him and a daughter that wishes he would be a role model. In fact, from the beginning of the movie we know that he is going to die. The movie does not let us know who is going to kill him, but the deeper we go into it, the more we come to understand the nature of his death and come to narrow down who will do it. Acceptance of oneself, strength in oneself, and the nature of beauty are the major themes of this movie, and we see this in the major characters. The wife is an important character because she is constantly searching for strength but never seems to find it. She is a real estate agent and wants to be like the King of real estate sales, he main competitor in the suburbs. By the end of the movie, we see her building herself up, learning what it means to be strong, only to collapse into a fit of hysteria at her husbands death. In fact, throughout the movie, the stronger that she becomes, the stronger those around her become and she can never actually reach the goal that she so much desires. Ricky is a guy who moves in next door. He is the character that has everything worked out. His father is a marine corps sergeant and has had to put up with brutal bashings by him. What this has done for him is make him appreciate life, and grow strong in himself. We learn that he has become a very competent dealer with people that owe him favours everywhere. What he knows though is that he knows beauty and he sees beauty in everything. At first we think that he is a pervert, but as we come to know him better, we come to learn that the reason he videos everything is that he wants to capture the beauty of the world around him. When we first see his room, we see a huge collection of video cassettes, and his pride and joy is the video of a plastic bag literally dancing in the wind. I can understand this passion, but as he says, recording it on video does not capture the beautify essence of nature, but rather creates an imperfect carbon copy, yet he desires to capture this beauty forever. Then it comes to the two girls, Jane and her best friend. Ricky tapes Jane constantly but ignores the girl who thinks she is beautiful. Jane considers herself ugly and her mother does little to help this. Her friend says that she gets off on people thinking that she is beautify because people who lust after her push her belief that she will be a model. Yet there is a hidden secret about this woman, and we learn it later in the movie when she professes to be a virgin. Jane never learns of this, but we see a big difference here. Jane has slept with Ricky and is very silent about it, while the other, who has never slept with anybody, but makes up stories goes into explicit details. Now Lester is the main focus of this movie, and he is the character that develops the most. He starts of a pathetic man who's only joy in life is tossing in the shower. Slowly, after seeing his daughter's friend for the first time, gains purpose in his life. He desires her, and when he learns that she desires him, he begins to exercise and to change. The exercise comes first, but he also meets Ricky and begins to buy drugs off of him. Slowly we see him become physically and mentally strong, and by the end of the movie he is standing up to his wife and being desired by the girl that he finds beautiful. His final words to her are, ""yes, I am glad"". He is then killed, but when he dies, and when Ricky finds him dead, he finds the smile of contentment on his face. Lester has died, but he has died a happy man. His life as been fulfilled. Thus this movie is about an epithany. Lester comes to learn and understand himself. He no longer cares that his wife is having an affair with the real estate king, nor does he desire his daughter's friend any more. He is simply content that he is who he is. As such, literature says that he must die. He has this epiphany and has reached the high point of his life. From this point on there is no more so his must die. Life cannot get any better than this so his life has ended and he moves on. This is different to other movies such as Bullsworth, where the main character has an epiphany yet still has things that he can do. Here he has reached the end, done everything that he needs to do, and thus can end life a happy man. The smile on his face when he dies shows us that he has finally fulfilled himself."

","Kevin Spacey plays as ""Lester Burnham"", who is an average suburban husband/father seems to be going through a midlife crisis. He has a wife, ""Carolyn Burnham"" who seems to have the ""white picket fence"", yet the couple is extremely unhappy and dissatisfied with their life. This also reflects through their high school daughter ""Jane"" played by Thora Birch, who in the end runs away with her awkward boyfriend and neighbor. Lester, after many years of sitting and being ""invisible and unappreciated"" within the family role, goes through a midlife crisis in which throughout the film he reverts back to his young adult life. The movie begins by ""Lester"" narrating the year leading up to his death. The director uses flashbacks, thawed frames, lighting, and sound effects to lead up to the scenes that are of importance and relevant to the storyline. By the invisible sounds of Lester's narration, we become more involved with his character in the film, as though we are delving deep into his thoughts. The thawed frames bring more dramatic effect to the scenes of more importance that take place, such as his infatuation with his daughter's high school friend, and also with the day of his death. The lighting also helps with these effects and is also used to focus in on the characters, where in many scenes the camera and lighting focus in directly on the character and seem to block out all other people from vision. The uses of these techniques tie all the characters into the main story plot—Lester's death. As the movie progresses, Lester ""mans up"" if you will to all those who have taken him for granted.

","American Beauty is story about a character Lester Burnham who represents a middle-aged American man who has lost his passion for life. The story follows the highs and lows of Lester's life and gives perspectives on many different character relationships that are responsible for his current and future state. The films main theme is that it is never too late to feel passion in your life; sometimes it just takes a little spark.<br/><br/>The story follows Lester on his daily life and his interactions with his family and friends. The film shows the perspectives of his wife Carolyn, who is a fanatic realtor who is obsessed with perfection and success. The drive and motivation for material success only separates Lester and her even more causing the couple to drift apart. This strain and discontent is one part of his life that fuels him to change. Lester also has become distant from his daughter is like most teenagers and has a hard time relating and understanding her parents. The films portrayal of Jane, Lester's daughter parallels the main character's story and provides multiple relationship perspectives. The story shows her lack of passion for anything and the spark is about to move in next door.<br/><br/>The film follows a main theme of enlightenment or gaining a lost perspective or finding that lost passion that I think we all can relate to. This powerful universal concept is what has defined every one of the characters. Lester represents the average American male that is fed up with his life, who, during his daughter's sporting event noticed her friend which sparked a newfound purpose and understanding in his life. This montage or motif defined Lester learning or re-experiencing a lost feeling. The use of rose petals and curious music showed the passion and lust for life that he has been missing, is starting to return. This music is replayed during the film to show similar feelings and understanding.<br/><br/>The film takes another turn when it shows the complex relationship between their new neighbor Ricky and his father. The story shows a strained relationship that clearly has been tested over the years and shows the struggle for a young man to understand and please his father. The film shows the view of a military man who wants to control his life and everyone around him, but he hiding the fact that he is a homosexual and has a hard time relating to his son. Colonel Fits represents the concept of ""don't believe what you see on the outside when it comes to your neighbor"". I thought the film did a great job showing the inability for Colonel Fits to understand and relate to anyone around him and that ultimately led to his demise. The film also used various cuts from Ricky's video camera. This grainy footage was very important in showing the reality of teen behavior and gave a glimpse into the mind of a young couple who is rebelling against their parents.<br/><br/>Overall this film was excellent and showed a glimpse into an American family and how their complicated relationships work. I think we all reach a point sometime in our life where we just stop, look around and ask yourself a question, ""how did I get here and where am I going?"" , that is what makes the film so powerful, the universal theme of finding the lost passion and purpose in our daily lives and relationships."

","Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening star in the biggest film of 1999, ""American Beauty"". This movie talks about this middle-age pervert for a father, named Lester Burnham, with a an obsessive wife, a quiet daughter, with a friend he secretly crushes for, and meets a strange guy with a video camera filming strange things that refer to him as beauty. Although this movie is completely awkward, that's what makes this movie good. Throughout, there's humor on sex, drugs, profanity, and beauty, duh! Director Sam Mendes is a unique director and brought a wild movie that actually entertains in its own way. Kevin Spacey delivers one of the best performances of the year, and one of the best in his career. Annette Bening is super awesome, and she delivers a lot of charismatic humor. Chris Cooper is golden choice, and Wes Bentley is just wonderful. Alan Ball provides a well-written script that contains perverted humor and some heartwarming messages. This is a well-made film, but it's sometimes awkward and uncomfortable. This leads to some of my problems with the film. This movie is not the type of movie that you and your whole family can see. This contains so much humor that's too unbelievable to notice. It wouldn't be nice to sit there in the middle of the couch with your family, watching something like this. But the rest of ""American Beauty"" is pitch-perfect. The script is beautifully well-written, the cast is amazingly talented, and the premise of this movie is special in an awkward way. ""American Beauty"", in my review, ""a well-made piece of entertainment, but it's just super uncomfortable""."
"ElMaruecan82","10","0","2","30 June 2011"," How can you define a movie that defines you ?
","""American Beauty"" is a challenging film to review. So challenging I hesitate between two radical attitudes, introspective and philosophical or cynical and detached, but I guess neither would work. One would be like Lester's infamous ""highlight of the day"", the other like Lester unbuttoning Angela's blouse with appetite before she reveals it's her first time. In both cases, it's excitement leading to disappointment. <br/><br/>So, what's ""American Beauty"" exactly telling us?<br/><br/>In fact, I don't even think the movie tells 'us' something, but rather tells something different 'for each of us' ... for some people, it's like an ""Existentialism For Dummies"" film, for others, it's an inspirational invitation to ""play an active role"" in life rather than ""enduring it"". The figure of Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham, the average looking tertiary employee man, incarnates the pervert effects of suburban life, mostly made of superficiality and illusions of happiness through the sensations of owning stuff, or being someone on the basis that you wears a tie, carry a briefcase and have a job, no matter how useless for the future of humanity, it is. <br/><br/>But Lester incarnates this figure with the quality that makes losers so appealing: lucidity. He knows his life is crap. He knows his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and his tormented 17-year old daughter Jane (Thora Birch) see him as a loser. And he knows his life has reached rock-bottom, but it's never too late to change. Paraphrasing another existential film of the same year, we meet Lester ""at a very strange time in his life"", where in a crucial Howard 'Bealesque' impulse, he decides he can't take it anymore.<br/><br/>And the pivotal point couldn't have been creepier. Lester gets infatuated with his daughter's friend, the cute and apparently slutty Angela, and decides to do some muscular exercises, to impress her and ultimately to  sort of  bang her. Well, the beautiful Conrad L. Hall's cinematography depicts Lester's lusty fantasies in such stylish aesthetics you totally forget that it's all about assessing his manhood on a creature so young, she would see the man, not the exploited office worker, the passive husband, or the lousy father. Angela, the delicate and sensual Mena Suvari shows the light to Lester, a road paved with so many rose petals that paint Lester's dreams in a shining red almost foreseeing the film's bloody epilogue. Anyway, from this lust at first sight moment, Lester is another man, abandoning himself to solitary pleasures not in the shower anymore, but in bed with Carolyn, who starts to realize that if she's not the mother of the year, she's not the wife either.<br/><br/>Carolyn is a flamboyant real estate agent who loves her job, as much as her little rose garden. She takes care of both with the same perfectionist delicacy and same dreams of accomplishment. She's so blinded by her ambition that she's incapable to realize the failure of her marriage and lives more confidently in the apparent illusion of comfort and success, than the real substantial essence of happiness. But Carolyn is only superficial if you look at her with superficial eyes. Look closer, since this is the movie's tag-line, Carolyn is not ambitious, she's not superficial, she's just naive for God's sake. She's the perfect embodiment of the constant optimistic attitude illustrated by Voltaire's character Candide whose motto -ironically- happened to be : ""We need to cultivate our garden"". <br/><br/>And for the disillusioned Jane, the idea of self-improvement can only be reduced to a project of breasts augmentation surgery. Her teenage crisis is aggravated by the absence of strong models. She hates her pervert father, her dull mother, her life. <br/><br/>The changes occurring in the Burnham Family will coincide with the arrival of the new neighbors, the Fits, another peculiar and not-so-happy family. The father Frank, Chris Cooper, is a bigot minded homophobic ex-military officer, with a totally lobotomized wife and one unique son, Wes Bentley as the tortured Ricky. Ricky is literally, the 'eye' of the film, as the one who films people with a cam and develops a strange ability to see inner beauty whether it's in Jane, dead birds or plastic bags, yes he's weird. ""Me Ricky, You Jane"". He's not just an eye-opener, he's eye-opening, catalyzing Lester's evolution, leading to one of the most inspiring 'I quit' scenes from a man who's got 'nothing to lose'. <br/><br/>But in a pessimistic device, paraphrasing another existential film of the same year, self-improvement ends up looking like masturbation and for Lester, the death it lead to, wasn't the ""little"" one. He'll end up killed by Frank Fits after the unfortunate misunderstanding built up all through the film. Ebert said something like: ""Lester Burnham is dead but he's not a loser anymore."" I disagree with this positivist attitude. Death is still the ultimate loss and I'd rather not be a loser, only if I had the chance to be something else.<br/><br/>So for realistic people, ""American Beauty"" is a pessimistic pamphlet against the American Way of Life. For pessimistic people, it's a depressing introspection into the alienating effect of the bourgeois way of life, for depressed people, it's the unbearable crappyness of life ... so crappy that you rather find beauty in a vulgar plastic bag floating in the wind ... <br/><br/>Or maybe ""everything is not what it seems to be"", and American Beauty is just a manipulative film trying to convey the dangerous idea that the best way to be freed from social obligations is to do sports, smoke pot, and live like a parasite, or it's simply the best film of the 90's. <br/><br/>In other words, either ""American Beauty"" is a masterpiece because it's so misunderstood, or it's such a masterpiece that it's misunderstood.<br/><br/>That's what I call the 'Fight Club' syndrome."

","Lester Burnham (Spacey) is a miserable 42 year old ad executive. He is also a old father, husband and the film's narrator. He and his wife Carolyn (Benning) are holding on to a terrible relationship. Lester's 16 year old daughter Jane (Birch) is finding it hard to fit in has zero self-esteem and is generally unhappy. Lester is a very mundane, apathetic, and describes himself as boring. However, he finds a new spark when he meets his daughter's friend Angela Hayes (Suvari). Lester begins to fantasize about Angela in very graphic situations. The Burnham's find themselves to have new neighbors, the Fits. Colonel Frank Fits (Cooper) his wife Barbara (Jamey) and their camcorder addicted son, Ricky (Bentley). It is quickly made apparent that Col Fits is a bigot.<br/><br/>The movie begins and ends over the course of just a few short days and follows each Burnham in a separate but ultimately related story line. Carolyn begins an affair with an associate in real estate. Lester blackmails his boss, takes a payoff and quits his job for the leisure of a burger flipping position. He also sells his economy car for his dream car. Lester is in a full-fledged midlife crisis. He also begins to work on his physical fitness to impress Angela. He also begins to purchase weed from Ricky after Jane begins to form a relationship with him.<br/><br/>Through a complicated series of events, Col Fits mistakes Lester and Ricky's weed liaison as a romance. Meanwhile, Carolyn and Buddy are caught by Lester who is completely indifferent. Carolyn is hurt more by her husband's lack of interest than she is about getting caught and the affair is ended. Ricky is confronted by his Dad about his relationship with Lester. Wanting to anger his father, Ricky admits to the ""affair"" runs to Jane and asks her to leave town. Angela is there and becomes upset because she wanted to steal Ricky from Jane.<br/><br/>Lester is kissed by an upset Col Fits. Lester rejects him and Colonel Fits fades into the rain. Carolyn, still distraught, sits in the car with a gun the man she had an affair with convinced her to get. Lester stumbles upon an upset Angela and is about to engage her sexually when he realizes she is a virgin. This seemingly snaps Lester out of the funk hes been in the entire film, and he assumes a father figure role toward Angela. She excuses herself to the restroom. Lester looks at a family photo and finds happiness again thinking about all of the families great memories completely oblivious that there is a gun to the back of his head. A gunshot rings out and the cameras pan between all the characters reactions, including a bloody Colonel sitting in front of his gun collection with one missing.<br/><br/>The main theme in this movie is that things are not always as they appear. You don't always realize what you have until you are about to lose it. Perspective is reality. The Theme is highlighted in the final narration of the film, as Lester realizes that he actually lived a good life and had all of the things that were truly important: ""I had always heard your entire life flashes in front of your eyes the second before you die. First of all, that one second isn't a second at all; it stretches on forever, like an ocean of time... For me, it was lying on my back at Boy Scout camp, watching falling stars... And yellow leaves, from the maple trees that lined our street... Or my grandmother's hands, and the way her skin seemed like paper... And the first time I saw my cousin Tony's brand new Firebird... And Janie, And Janie... And... Carolyn. I guess I could be pretty upset about what happened to me... but it's hard to stay mad, when there's so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much, my heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst... And then I remember to relax, and stop trying to hold on to it, and then it flows through me like rain and I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life... You have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm sure. But don't worry... you will someday."""

I'm not even sure why, except that it skewers the materialism, complacency and (via Chris Cooper's wacko character) the growing (and eerily prophetic) growth of homophobia (amongst gays themselves--how weird is THAT?) as well as militant ""activism"" and repression which foreshadows the insanity of ""The Tea Party"" (GOD! I hate that stupid name, which betrays all that the Sons of Liberty held sacred!).<br/><br/>Anyway, we have a midlife crisis (no big deal--nothing new) but in BOTH parents? That's news.

I have watched 'American Beauty' half a dozen times and not once did I encounter a moment where I felt a shot was wasted, or a line of dialogue mislaid. This movie is the most realistic portrayal of life I have ever seen in film. Every single aspect of this film - the brilliant direction by Sam Mendes, the wonderful original screenplay by Alan Ball, the original score by Thomas Newman, and of course the wonderful acting performances led by Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening - is near perfect. A testament to the quality of the film that swept the top Academy and Golden Globe awards in 2000.<br/><br/>No part of 'American Beauty' is more memorable than the last 2-3 minutes. The sheer prowess of the direction, cinematography and screenplay intertwined with the subtle musical notes converge to form a poetic end. The touching narration by Lester (Kevin Spacey) makes you think long after the credits roll. There is a lot of wonderfully written comedy too. And the actors (especially Spacey) are so good that there is no artificiality in the way the jokes are pulled off.

","American Beauty tells the uncomplicated story of a middle aged man in a mid-life crisis, depressed, doubting his marriage and outrageously becoming infatuated with his daughter's best friend. However, what is a very unimaginative storyline quickly becomes the basis for a very cultural and deep journey for every audience member, and leaves no-one doubting that Sam Mendes has the incredible ability to take what might appear as a vulgar idea and turn it into a piece of art. The film aims to answer the question many people have asked; ""What is beauty?"" and answers it well.<br/><br/>This movie slots into the ""drama"" category easily and effortlessly. The lack of visual effects and clever cinematography techniques puts the success of the film entirely down to the performance, and the cast doesn't disappoint. Kevin Spacey represents the man that everyone imagines when pondering the phrase ""mid-life crisis,"" and paired with Annette Bening you have the perfect awkward couple whose marriage is going down the drain. <br/><br/>Throughout the film there are moments that will make you uncomfortable at the very least, and horrified at the most. A memorable scene where Spacey's character is experiencing an erotic dream and is caught pleasuring himself by his wife will make this movie a difficult one to watch with anyone who's not your partner. Mendes tackles many issues like this throughout the duration of this very thought-provoking masterpiece; and indeed, you could argue that he tries to squash too many messages into two hours for the audience to digest. Infidelity, drugs, low self-esteem, violence, homosexuality, mental health, murder and discrimination all make an appearance, however Mendes entwines those issues so thoroughly into the storyline that until you sit and pick the film apart, you may not even notice they're crammed in. This combined with language (the ""F"" word is used thirty times) and nudity awards the film the ""18"" it was given, and makes it certainly not one to show your kids. <br/><br/>Mendes purposefully confuses the audience with their attitude towards the characters, and he seems to enjoy the uncertainty as to whether characters are, in simple terms, ""good"" or ""bad."" Mena Suvari presents a reasonably pretty young woman named Angela, who at the beginning seems arrogant, stuck up, and happy to sleep with everyone around, including her best friend, Jane's father. However, at the last minute Mendes pulls the rug out from under our feet as it's revealed she's been lying to other characters and the audience and is in fact a sensitive, vulnerable woman with low self-esteem. The use of personalities that will be familiar to the audience helps them to relate to the issues presented further, and possibly even makes you take a step back and compare your own life to those of the characters.<br/><br/>What is your purpose in life? How do you feel about yourself? How do you interact with other people? Is your life turning into one big routine? These are all questions ""American Beauty"" forces you to ask yourself as it delves deeper into the life of one middle class American family and their friends and neighbours, who have everything yet nothing. Watch with an open mind and you won't be disappointed, and look out for the amazing performance and beautiful soundtrack. This really is a film to watch again and again and still be marvelled at every time; ten out of ten."

","This is a story about the implosion of one seemingly perfect American family. Lester (Kevin Spacey), Carolyn (Annette Bening), and Jane(Thora Birch) Burnham are a family on the brink. From the outside they appear to be happy but upon closer examination one can see that all of them are on the verge of falling apart. Lester is hopelessly depressed, Carolyn is scared to death of not succeeding, and Jane is struggling with self-esteem issues but is also being neglected by her parents who are caught up in their own misery. It's almost as if both of Jane's parents are simultaneously experiencing what is commonly known as a midlife crisis. Lester ends up quitting his job to work as a burger joint and becomes obsessed with Angela (Mena Suvari), one of Jane's best friends. As things get worse at home Jane builds a relationship with her new neighbor Ricky (Wes Bently) who is the son of a former marine and the victim of physical abuse.<br/><br/>This film takes the complexity of human relationships to a new level. There are several points within the film where the director made a point of showing the family photos where they were all smiling like they are happy. This was done to put emphasis on the facade they had been putting on as a family. He even went so far as to show family photos from when Jane was younger as if to show how long they had been pretending and that they were, most likely, exhausted from it. The director also does a great job of showing us these characters from all angles. We are able to see what each character looks like through the eyes of the other and from their own. We see that they are all lovable and they are all despicable. They are all human in every sense of the word."

","""American Beauty"" is easily one of the best movies I have seen. The movie begins with a girl(Thora Birch) being caught on videotape requesting an unseen person to murder her father. The father is later revealed to be one Lester Burnham(Kevin Spacey), who, on the outside, looks like your average suburban family man. In reality though, he is into 20 years of a loveless marriage and considered, in his own words, a ""gigantic loser"" by both his wife & daughter. He works in an advertising agency which has, at the point where this movie begins, decided to lay him off. His wife Carolyn(Annette Benning) runs a freelance real estate business which is not doing well. She is a woman possessed of misguided notions, constantly chanting self-help mantras to herself, which does nothing to better her state of mind.<br/><br/>One day, when he goes to see his daughter Jane's performance as a cheerleader, he notices her friend Angela Hayes(Mena Suvari) & starts lusting after her. The turning point comes when he meets Ricky Fits(Wes Bentley), the abused son of his new neighbour Col.Frank Fits(Chris Cooper), at a party and is surprised by his fearlessness and complete self confidence. He gets the idea that he can regain the voice he lost in his household and that Angela is attainable. This starts a series of events which ultimately results in Lester's death.<br/><br/>The tag line ""Look Closer"" has plenty of meaning. Just like Lester, every one of us have been & probably still are unsure of what we really want in life & just like all the characters in this movie, we try to hide our real selves & project this false public image(Angela stands as a case in point). Thus,everything is not as it seems to be. I was able to identify a lot with this movie and its characters personally because I too have been lost, insecure and unsuccessful. <br/><br/>As far as acting goes, Wes Bentley is, surprisingly, the one who truly stands out. While Kevin Spacey's performance is better, Ricky's presence can be felt at the very heart of the movie in a similar way to Samuel L Jackson's Jules Sinnfield. Even The women, Thora Birch, Annette Benning & Mena Suvari do excellent jobs of making their characters solid and distinguishable. Even Chris Cooper as Frank Fits pulls a surprise act in the film's climax.<br/><br/>Overall, having seen this movie twice, I can safely say that this is one of the best I've seen & deserved every award it got<br/><br/>My rating-9/10"

","Sam Mendes' American Beauty is a film for everyone to watch. You can relate to at least one character in the film. Mendes did an excellent job of creating characters that we love and hate. American Beauty appears to be a film about a suburban family living the American dream, a mother, father, and daughter, living in a white house with blue shutters. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a husband and father that hates his life and wants a better life. He best describes how he feels when they all get into the car his wife, Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening) and daughter Jane Burnham (Thora Birch) got into the first seats of the car and Lester was forced get into the backseat. Lester says that his life makes him feel sedated. Lester Burnham is a very unhappy man; this is truly relevant when the film is getting started. Our first encounter with him is when he is in the shower masturbating, this lets us know that despite him having a wife he is not satisfied with her. His life changes once he starts to fantasize about his daughter's friend, Angela. Lester wants her to notice him and he yearns to be young so he starts to work out, smoke pot, and even buys a ""muscle' car a 1970 Pontiac Firebird. Lester soon quits his job that he hates and black mails his boss for another year salary. Lester decided to stand up for himself after seeing the neighbor's son, Ricky Fits stand up for himself at a job that he didn't need. Carolyn is also unhappy with her life so she tries to be successful with real estate business to make her feel better, but she fails. Her life turns around when she starts having an affair with a fellow real estate agent, Buddy. She is found out when Lester catches them together in the drive-thru of the restaurant he works at. Jane is the normal one in the family she does have the normal adolescent problems, such as her want for a breast augmentation. She realizes that her neighbor, Ricky Fits, loves her and thinks that she is beautiful. Jane and Ricky get very close and start to learn things about each other, like both of them are longing for love and acceptance. The family as a whole wants to be love, happy, and to be accepted. This film uses music throughout it, the main time is when Lester is fantasizing about Angela. During this time the camera starts to zoom in closer to her making her the main attraction in the scene. The lights around her are dim but there is a spotlight that shines on her. The music is instrumental and she is always surrounded by rose petals. In these scenes rose petals symbolize beauty. Their house is also surrounded by roses. I felt as through this movie was one of a kind. From my movie experience I have not seen any movies like it. There are movies about suburban families and the things that happen to them and obstacles that have to overcome but the way that this film is put together is very unique. The main theme in this film is the complexity of human relationships. Carolyn and Lester are not sexually active making Lester masturbate and fantasize about Angela and making Carolyn have an affair with a fellow real estate agent. The film also shows us that appearances can be deceiving and the beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Angela was make out to be the pretty little whore that everyone slept with but we soon realize that she makes that up so that she can fit in. Angela felt ugly and just like the Burnham family she wanted to be loved, happy, and accepted. Even though the Burnham's were living the American Dream they were supposed to be happy but once we met them we could see just how unhappy they really are."

","American beauty; the beauty of this movie cannot be described in words but only an attempt can be made. In a time of 120 minutes this movies shows more than a 1000 colors of life closely knitted. This movie is all about life. Its starts with an ordinary beginning and ends with a bang. The message in the end is one worth pondering. The movie storyline is amazing, the cinematography is stunning, acting is stupendous overall it makes the movie a delight for cinema buffs.<br/><br/>The story starts off with Lester Burnham and his Carolyn Burnham who seem to have a healthy married life. Lester has been writing for a magazine since past 14 years whereas Carolyn is struggling with her real estate business. Deep down the line Lester has been sucking himself inside a vacuum that had no space to breathe. This attitude continued for his depression and degradation in relations at home as well as work. Burnham got fired from his job and this added to his woes. The couple also has a teenage daughter Jane who hates her dysfunctional family and tries to stay aloof. Jane thinks her father is a total loser. Lester meanwhile falls for Jane's friend who is totally egoistic. Lester also starts working out to look good and keeps on fantasizing her. Jane falls for a quiet, abnormal neighbor Rikky who studies with her and had newly moved in the neighborhood. Rikky deals in drugs and also shoots films. He thinks Jane is the most beautiful girl he had ever met. Rikky father is a retired marine and believes in total discipline , moreover is a homophobic. Carol is a real estate agent and could never do well in her career and decides to sleep with the rival Kane. Lester discovers this when he was working a waiter in a fast food joint. The movie flows really well and is a delight to watch.<br/><br/>This movie shows different shades of life and left me speechless. The best quote comes in the end from the narrator of the story (Lester)"

Yet there is passion, deep-seated need. Above all this film gives us a near life experience.<br/><br/>The acting is - well; superb. Spacey rightly gets an Oscar.

It's a matter of different things.<br/><br/>Lester has everything anyone else can ask for. But things not always work in a so called perfect life...<br/><br/>What I really enjoyed about the film is how American families really live. It displays reality through a very peculiar manner. There's plenty of black humor, and situations derived by causality.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey delivers a great performance as Lester. He displays the reality of millions of men in the world. Annette Bening gives a fantastic performance. Extraordinary mix of desperation, frustration, and the burdens of being a mad woman. Wes Bentley was a decent choice for playing Ricky. The guy looks disturbed. Thora Birch demonstrates again she's a very fine actress. Mena Suvair is extremely sexy, pretty, and turned me on. What I liked the best about her acting is that she was very natural. That's quality. Chris Cooper was also great. The man is a very talented actor. Pether Gallagher is just good.<br/><br/>This is a movie that will make you reflex about your life and how to enjoy it at it's full.

","The film American Beauty is a film that sets a great example of how people will sacrifice their happiness just to live up to the picture perfect successful life that society has painted. In this film Lester (Kevin Spacey is very unhappy with his marriage and his job. He is constantly disrespected by his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and his daughter Jane (Thora Birch). He works for a company that he hates and longs for the day that he has the nerve to just walk out. Carolyn is a success driven real estate agent who is in constant competition with the self proclaimed ""King of Real Estate"" Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher). This causes her to neglect her husband and her daughter and lose all morals for their relationships. Jane is ashamed of what her mother and father have become and wants nothing to do with them, she finds herself feeling alone in the world with no parental guidance.<br/><br/>Lester and Carolyn decide to attend one of Jane's school basketball games, where she is a cheerleader, and Lester finds himself daydreaming about one of the girls on the cheerleading squad who just so happens to be one of his daughters good friends. Later in the film this same girl tries to seduce Lester and this sets him on the road to redemption. Carolyn attends an event with Lester where she runs into Buddy and they decide to have lunch so that he can teach her some of his tricks in the real estate business. This lunch later turns into Carolyn and Buddy having an affair and them later getting caught by Lester. This just adds fuel to Lester's fire in his journey of becoming this man who really doesn't care what the world or his wife thinks. Jane starts dating the neighbor/schoolmate Ricky who everyone thinks is weird and psycho. Ricky's dad the Colonel, who is a retired marine, thinks that Ricky is sleeping with Lester.<br/><br/>The music in this film adds so much to the characters and what they are feeling. For example, there is a scene where Lester is riding down the street in his car smoking weed and he has American Woman by Lenny Kravitz playing on the radio which is a very free spirited and care free song. I thought that this song went perfectly with the way that Lester had been currently acting. The lighting in this film also played a big part in enhancing the moods of the characters to the viewers. There were scenes in the film where the mood was relaxed and mellow, during this time the lighting was very dim and subtle, giving you a sense of calm and relaxation. Mainly throughout the film there was natural lighting used, for example when Carolyn and Lester were both in their cars driving down the street there seemed to only natural sun light being used in both of those scenes.<br/><br/>Overall the director (Sam Mendes), writer (Alan Ball) and the rest of their crew did a great job when putting this film together. I enjoyed how each actor brought the characters to life just by doing little things like facial expressions, and body language. There weren't any dead parts of the film; it kept you interested from the beginning to the end. I am looking forward to enjoying more films by Mendes and Ball."

","1999 was a great year for film. There was Magnolia, Being John Malkovich(Two of my five favorite films), The Green mile, Fight club. All just great movies. But besides Being John Malkovich and Magnolia, there has never been anything like American beauty.<br/><br/>American beauty won best picture that year. It wasn't my favorite film of that year. It was probably my third. My three favorite films of that year all have something to remember. Magnolia's climax has raining frogs. In Being John Malkovich, Malkovich goes inside of his mind and sees himself in many different forms. In American beauty, Kevin Spacey and Chris Cooper kiss.<br/><br/>That's not the only memorable thing about the film. American beauty is funny, and real. And it definitely burns in the memory. It's flawless, and compared to The Green mile, The Sixth sense, The Cider house rules, and The Insider, it deserved best picture. It is an immediate attention grabber.<br/><br/>American beauty tells the lives of Lester(played fantastically by Kevin Spacey) and Carolyn(played excellently by Annette Bening), a married couple who aren't happy.

Carolyn has an affair with her real estate partner(played by Peter Gallagher) Jane and their new neighbor(played by Wes Bently, atrocious actor) have a thing going on. He's kind of crazy. So is his father(played by Chris Cooper), who is attracted to one of the neighbors. I'm sorry that i've sort of spoiled most of the film. I just love it so much I have to tell it's story.<br/><br/>So much happens in American beauty. It is such an interesting picture. Really. They really don't exaggerate the beauty in the title. The only flaw, if you can count it, is Wes Bently. He is such a horrible actor. If you don't think he's that bad, watch Ghost rider. Then you'll see.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey deserved to win best actor. His character is so lovably funny. There are so many enjoyable scenes and some scenes of eroticism. I know it's a weird movie. But just because it's weird doesn't mean it's bad. At all.

","There seems to be a host of mid-life crisis films that get magnetised to me. First was Lost in Translation, now it's American Beauty (I would be surprised if the next one is James Bond). And they both have a lot in common. Hugely funny, tragic and more gripping than if you cling-filmed yourself to the TV while they were playing.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey (You can start to get excited now) plays Lester Burnham, an advertising executive who despises his job, has a marriage 'just for show', has a daughter who hates him and he nurtures a crush for her friend Angela. Okay wait a minute, that sounds a tad like a paedophile; but he has a reasonable excuse in that he is suffering all the former three - oh and the fact he has a year to live.<br/><br/>There are no explosions, tacky use of CGI or bad placed performances. It's just an accurate interpretation of a family willing to cover up its inevitable division and loathing for each other. What makes it so special is how realistic it becomes without ever falling to the standards of a melodramatic soap opera drama.<br/><br/>First timers: Director Sam Mendes and Writer Alan Ball have struck gold. No scrap that, they have struck beauty; and made a film so immersive, so enjoyable and just, well perfect it feels like any other duo could have ruined the fragile issues and motif's that are so sensitively handled.<br/><br/>Plus the fact that Kevin Spacey is some type of acting God - I never realised how hilarious arguments can be; there is really nothing that can be faulted about American Beauty and it fully deserves its place in the IMDb top 250."

","Confronting, bitter-sweet but nevertheless hilarious, that about sums it up. Lester's midlife crisis gets more painful by the minute, but he is in fact one of the most wonderful anti-heroes I've ever seen. He's the typical guy that can't catch a break, which makes it incredibly fulfilling to me when he actually manages to tell some people of. He's always wished things would have turned out better for him, but they didn't so he works out and buys a sports car. But in the end, he can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of his stupid little life. If that's not beautiful, I really don't know what is. The side characters are all so well-written, so fitting. I particularly like the actress playing Ricky's mom, a character that's just kinda waiting until she can finally die. The climax of the movie featuring Ricky's dad is also a great example of a thorough character study. Not to mention that it's just really funny in a weird way. I could go on and on, but I probably wouldn't end up saying anything no one else has said before. Incredible movie."

Kevin Spacey turns in a terrific performance as does Annette Bening, and same goes for the other members of the cast(Wes Bentley as Ricky, Thora Birch as the daughter, and Allison Janney and Chris Cooper as Ricky's mom and dad, respectively).

He becomes smitten with his daughter's best friend (Mina Suvari) and starts buying dope from the new kid next door (Wes Bentley). He quits his job and goes to work at a fast food eatery as a fry cook. Meanwhile, his wife, a real estate agent with serious emotional issues, takes up with a competing real estate guru (Peter Gallagher). The daughter hooks up with the dope dealing boy next door. The dope dealing boy's dad (Chris Cooper) is a military veteran and mental case who abuses his family. And so it goes, as Kurt Vonnegut used to write. Everybody is absolutely magnificent, the script sizzles and the camera-work is outstanding.

","After viewing the movie American Beauty viewers can see how true beauty throughout life is depicted in all stages of life. The theme of the film is that not all things in life are what they seem to be. The main character Lester Burnham played by Kevin Spacey experiences a mid-life crisis caused by a daunting, needy wife Carolyn Burnham played by Annette Benning and a rebellious yet insecure daughter Jane played by Thora Birch. Lester becomes infatuated with Angela, Jane's friend and a major lifestyle change occurs to gain some form of sexual, flirtatious relationship with her. The movie begins with a voice-over and Lester is masturbating in the shower and this is the highlight of the day. You know right from the beginning that Lester is a man of hardship, sadness, and is missing an important element in his life. He knows deep down that something is missing, but what? He realizes what it is when meeting Angela for the first time outside the school gymnasium.<br/><br/>This movie unravels the truth and hidden truths about suburban life in America and how the typical middle class American carries with it dark, sexual, and unconventional life secrets that many are too ashamed to share. Lester breaks the mold of conventional families and finds himself freeing himself of the burdens of life in suburbia and a family who just pretends to be happy. The truth is Lester's cynical wife Carolyn has her own fantasies and seductive admirations of breaking the vows of marriage.<br/><br/>In comparison to theme, this movie resembles that of the movie Crash. I say this because in both movies people are give a social stature to live by and many are judged on appearance alone. In the movie American Beauty, Lester is judged by the where he resides and being a typical family man with a loving wife and daughter, but you discover quickly that this stereotype is untrue of the Burnham family. In the movie Crash people are judged based on the ethnicity and skin type. It is discovered in the end that all ethnicities are judged and characterized by all and that we all intertwine into each other's lives and make decisions that will eventually crash into one another. <br/><br/>American Beauty signifies the true beauty in people and what many long for throughout their lives. Though Lester plays a character of negativity, you can only assume that he eventually founds some happiness in the last year of his life. American Beauty proves that not all things in life are what they seem to be."
"kennethkropp","7","0","1","2 May 2010"," The American Dream
","It may take a few viewings to extract them, but the American Beauty explores many themes, the central of which is true happiness. More specifically, the movie deals with the ideal of true happiness and how that happiness is often lost during and due to the American style conception and pursuit of it.<br/><br/>American Beauty is centered around Lester Burnham (played by Kevin Spacey,) a seemingly typical post mid-life suburbanite stuck in a demeaning job and married to a rather cold, unfaithful and superficial wife Carolyn (played by Annette Bening.) The couple have a daughter, Jane, who is in the throes of a full out rebellion- particularly against Lester, whose passivity only seems to aggravate her. Jane brings home a 15 year old friend, Angela (played by Mena Suvari) whom Lester develops a deep infatuation for. Jane also befriends their next door neighbor, Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley) who has an abusive repressed homosexual for a father and a mother who has all but completely withdrawn into herself mentally. Lester's infatuation with Angela causes him to act out in a grown up temper tantrum; he quits his job, starts recreational drug use, starts working out to impress Angela and begins to assert himself at home. Lester also befriends Ricky, which leads Ricky's dad to suspect they are having a sexual relationship. In the movie's climax, Lester attempts to seduce Angela, but stops his advances when he learns she's a virgin. Ricky's dad, who had attempted to kiss Lester during a misunderstanding, comes to the house and shoots Lester in the head, killing him.<br/><br/>Lester's infatuation with Angela is expressed in the film through rather artistic slow motion cutaways of Angela, naked and surrounded by red rose petals. Roses are prevalent throughout the movie and is the movie's central symbol.<br/><br/>American Beauty seems to be an indictment of the stereotypical American dream: finding happiness through tangible, traditional successes and categories. To me the movie specifically targets (whether intentionally or unintentionally) the Baby Boomer generation, one of the first generations to have the world handed to them on a silver platter. It is a temper tantrum in and of itself, the views of a generation that wants to flaunt the rules, party hard and prey on their young to maintain a lifestyle forever. A generation that views the establishment and those who ""follow the rules"" as repressed deviants. Ultimately, it's a ""follow your dreams"" story about flaunting responsibility and finding true happiness in the superficialities."

The ending top the movie will leave you on the edge of your seat. In the movie the director used a motif of roses. It was a great touch to enhance his fantasy world and it really makes you wonder why a rose? It took me to the end to realize it was to help the audience understand the beauty around him and let you know that life is too beautiful to waste.<br/><br/>I felt that the theme of the movie is things are not always what they seem. People conger up perceived notions about others in their mind and they get all worked about nothing. Throughout the movie Ricky films everything that he sees and keep sit all on tape. In one scene Ricky is filming Lester working out naked in his garage and his father Frank finds it and that is where the gay relationship was created. Like I said Ricky films everything. This happens throughout the movie Crash. People are giving into stereotypes and letting it get the best of them. The best example I can give you is in Crash when the store clerk needed his lock fixed and the locksmith looks like a thug. The store owner gets robbed that night and automatically blames it on the locksmith. I have learned that people assume if you look a certain way you are going to act a certain way and if you're a man filming another man working out then you're automatically gay.

"imagiking","9","0","1","28 March 2010"," American Beauty: Cinematic Perfection
","I tracked down this film more to sample the further delights of Alan Ball than anything else, his incredible creation in Six Feet Under demanding I seek out all else by this genius. His debut as a screenwriter, as well as Mendes' as a director, American Beauty has become recognised as an enduring great.<br/><br/>A search for meaning in a flawed world, American Beauty is the life of Lester Burnham. An advertising employee, Burnham is the epitome of the archetypical suburban man: trapped in a job he despises, a marriage which has long ago run out of steam, and a life which seems devoid of significance or happiness. Catalysed by the arrival of revolutionary thinker Ricky next door, Burnham begins to realise the extent of unhappiness he is prone to, and see his life for what it truly is.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey's voice-over narration introduces us immediately to his character and the world around him, as well as the eventual turn of the plot. This early revelation of the film's ending is interesting and tells us from the outset that American Beauty relies not on narrative to entice its viewers. What exactly it does rely on is impossible to say, the pure perfection of each of its constituent elements as apparently important as each other. Ball's script dominates, his impressive wit and broodingly dark intelligence reigning supreme over the film. Mendes' direction gives us shot after shot of crippling beauty, as per the title. The performances are perhaps the most attractive thing to be found, the casting almost certainly the best I have ever seen. These actors and actresses were born for these roles, with Spacey, Bening, Cooper and Bentley providing particularly deep immersion and poignancy. All combine to give a powerful film which incites thought, boasts an unrivalled aesthetic, questions the modern world, and entertains superbly.<br/><br/>With the dark hilarity and ripe relevance characteristic of Ball, Mendes gives us a memorable, sublime and incredibly important piece of cinematic perfection. Career defining performances from all give us characters we recognise from our own lives, further dragging us into the film's spellbinding brilliance. Unique and ever essential, American Beauty is the kind of film which makes life worth living."

","Of the many films I've watched American Beauty is one of the less entertaining ones. A film that doesn't contain an useful action and plays without an exciting plot. American Beauty focuses on thought-provoking, which is well done, but lacks in filling the story with some entertaining-factor. After watching this movie viewers will think about there lives if they didn't fell asleep before.<br/><br/>Lester (Kevin Spacey), a usual faggot-father who lives in an American suburbia, experiences his boring life and starts ruining it. His wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) uses to fake the impression that her life is brilliant. She works as a real estate agent but is too foolish to sell houses. Their daughter Jane (Thora Birch), a boring teenager without self-confidence, hates herself and her life. She fell in love with Ricky (Wes Bentley), the weird neighbour next door. He films his whole life and even the oddest scenes. This odd guy needs to get to an asylum.<br/><br/>Lester starts freaking off, quits his job and starts working at a fast-food restaurant. Fell in love with Jane's best friend Angela (Mena Suvari) and got shot by Col. Fits (Chris Cooper), the homosexual and homophobic neighbour who lost his structure and life, so needs to kill Lester. As you can see, there are many weird psychos in this movie who ruin the content. In fact that's everything you need to know about this movie.<br/><br/>The only two things that are quite well done are the thought-provoking aspect which makes you think about your sense off life. And the second one is the camera work and the cinematic devices. This makes you feel with Lester and supports his miserable bad attitude.<br/><br/>All in all I would recommend this move to everybody who intents to commit suicide because they may get changed their mind. But every usual adult or teenager should keep away of this movie. Boring! My rating: 2/10"
"Senze","7","0","1","20 January 2010"," There's so much beauty
","1999's ""American Beauty"" centres around Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), who's an ordinary human being, which seems to be functioning not to live. ""There's anything worse than being ordinary"", is what Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) signalizes. But Lester is ordinary. He carries on a profession, which implies responsibility. His wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) is an unsuccessful real estate agent not being in love anymore. His daughter Jane (Thora Birch) has to fight with usual teenage problems: She does not like her look including her breasts, her parents annoy her and nobody understands her. Everything appears ordinary. Reminding of every man's midlife crisis, Lester falls violently in love with Angela, who approximately is 20 years younger. This causes an one-eighty in Lester's thoughts. He wants to be young, to be free of sorrows, to enjoy his life again. He quits his job in order to get a job with the ""least amount of responsibility"", he sells his car to buy a muscle car and after having met Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley), a drug dealer in his neighbourhood, he even smokes pot. He principally shows how to escape from this adult world. This is even intensified by Ricky, who even sees beauty in plastic bags, which reminds of Reamonn's song ""Through the eyes of a child"". This filial point of view makes you think of your own live, your own perception, of the way you look at things yourself. I'd even go so far as to say that ""American Beauty"", with its undisputed beauty, is able to change the way you perceive your own surroundings. It really makes you reflect your place in this world. This movie even would be able to help depressives. Am I joking? No, I'm not. Concentrating on the generated beauty even depressives would enjoy their lives for a moment. But this beauty is not transported completely, because Sam Mendes' concept of showing this ordinary live achieves deadly boredom. For example you are not able to spot differences between the houses in the Burnhams' neighbourhood. Another aspect is the fact that you might have seen rows of houses like them in 30 other movies before. It is definitely appropriate to allege Mendes that he wanted to destroy this beauty on purpose. If you don't know this film yet, watch it and plunge into a world free of sorrows, responsibility and beauty. But be careful! You need something to stand boredom as well."

"AleaClint","9","0","1","5 September 2009"," I want to look good naked
","-Lester Burnham is a great example of how sex or the promise of sex can change a man's life. When we meet him, his life is PAINFULLY ordinary. He works a poop job that he hates, he leads a sexless marriage with his wife that he has no love for anymore, whacking off in the shower is his high point and his daughter hates him. His life seems to be going downhill fast till he goes to his daughter's school function and falls for her cheerleader friend Angela. He has fantasies about her, which all somehow include rose petals. He decides that in order to have a chance with Angela he must start working out so he can look good naked. This begins to trigger a change in his life as he begins to do all the things he's always wanted do. He quits his job and gets a new one flipping burgers, buys himself a pretty sweet car and he begins to take charge of his life. All seems to be going well for good ol' Lester till his homophobic neighbor gets the wrong idea and does something horrible to our hero. -Who knew that an average looking town filled with seemingly average people could make such an interesting story. Alan Ball did and thank goodness he had such a sick and twisted mind to write this great story. Fans of the great and badly missed ""Six Feet Under"" will no doubt recognize all the weird Alan Ball signature in this movie that he translated into the TV show. From the weird fantasies to regular people, doing weird things is all Alan Ball at his best. I'm guessing if I were to peek into his mind I wouldn't find a happy man leading an ordinary life like the characters he comes up with seem to be. Considering the tone of the movie and just how f***king creepy the opening is one would think this would be a serious movie but it has more laughs than the crap that get passed as comedies nowadays. -The best filmmakers always somehow seem to be a smidge overweight and the brilliant Sam Mendes continues that unhealthy trend. i guess i have to gain a couple if i ever want that golden statue. Mendes has this great obsession with simplicity that goes hand in hand with Ball's quirky script. Most filmmakers would probably go ever board with the story and turn the dark humor into slapstick but Mendes keeps his cool and in the process makes the movie better for it. I've only seen three of his movies and this is best yet. I just love how he took things that looked simple in Ball's script like the paper bag caught in the wind and made it into something beautiful like the way it is in the movie now. Can't wait for his next potential masterpiece. the late great Conrad L. Hall will always be remembered as one of the great DP's of our time and this movie as one of his best looking. Much like Mendes the cinematography is very simple and has many hidden messages if you looked closely or watched the movie 1000 times. -One thing I love about this movie is the nail biting suspense in the last act. I just love the scene when Chris Cooper goes up to Spacey and you just don't know what this crazy man is going to do. Is he going to kill him, punch him or kiss him? I've never had a movie do that to me before and I really loved it. Really gets you into the movie. Giving his best performance yet is Keyer Soze as Lester Burnham. he's a man that want more in life and his transformation from boring normal everyday life to happy and content is captured wonderfully by Spacey. If memory serves me right then I believe the hicks at the academy gave him an award for this. It caused some controversy as many people thought that crown should have gone to Denzel. -Thora Birch dose a brilliant job of playing the Goth like Jane who despite her short screen time manages to capture you and really makes you feel for her character although she does get whiny like a lot of us around that age. this and ""Ghost World"" are the best acting jobs she's done and I hope she gets more jobs that showcase her talents. Mena Suvari does the job of the insecure seductress really well. I love how her character isn't all one dimensional as we learn more about why she puts on such a shallow exterior. Chris Cooper plays the homophobic army man nicely so does his wife whose played by an unrecognizable Allison Janney. With a dad that's so uptight and a mother that's virtually dead you'd expect their offspring to be a stiff but instead of that we get a dope dealing DV obsessed boy played by Wes Bentley who looks WAY too old to be in high school. What high schooler has a 5 o'clock shadow? -it won a lot of Oscars and got a lot of buzz and it deserved every bit of it."

","After years I finally watched this highly acclaimed film from Sam Mendes and I must say ""American Beauty"" is one of those films that anyone can enjoy for the message it sends that people can rediscover youth and life again thru what they see. It proves a strong point everyone sees something different and beauty is always in the eye of the beholder.<br/><br/>The story is just perfect set in the suburbs the terrific Kevin Spacey is Lester Burnham a middle age man in a midlife crisis who feels down as he even feels the end is near he has nothing to live for. Even though he has a good paying job as a magazine article writer and also he's married to a prim and proper elegant lady named Carolyn(Annette Bening)to add on to that his teenage daughter Jane(Thora Birch). Still Lester feels lonely and tired as if he's caught up in a never ending spin cycle of conformity. Lester needs to feel young again and he needs to discover the will to live again.<br/><br/>It's upon noticing his daughters best teenage female school friend the hot and sexy Angela(Mena Suvari)that's when his feel of youth and rediscovery of life is felt again. And it's showed by his working out to get in shape and his fantasies of beautiful daydreams feature Angela. So tired with the high class life Lester quits his job and even resorts to flipping burgers and he finally sees for real what a phony marriage he had as Mrs. prissy Carolyn has turned out to be a cheating lady.<br/><br/>For many they might find this film challenging and probably like me be a little displeased with in my opinion the tragic end. Still ""American Beauty"" is a classic for showing how by just seeing simple beauty of youth can change a person and make them feel young again and it opens up the need to live life all over again. Beauty brings happiness and hope. Most important this film proves the old saying true ""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder""."

","""American Beauty"", the 1999 Best Picture Oscar winner, explores the lives of three suburban family members who've grown apart and are each looking for a way to reinvigorate their lives. Most notably this includes the father (Kevin Spacey) developing an obvious infatuation with his teenage daughter's attractive friend (Mena Suvari).<br/><br/>The film's tagline, ""Look closer"", signals that this is a film that will be appreciated most by those who do just that. That being said, the film's storyline is compelling even if you don't pay much attention to the film's underlying philosophy of 'beauty'. In any case, I feel that the script's Oscar win was warranted though I'm sure that the subject matter won't appeal to everyone.<br/><br/>The film features a well-assembled ensemble cast. Kevin Spacey won an Oscar for his role and, while I prefer other roles of his to this one, I do think that he was a deserving winner. Annette Bening was also quite good but she was beaten for Oscar by Hilary Swank's powerful performance in ""Boys Don't Cry"". I'm surprised that Chris Cooper didn't seem to garner much notice for his strong supporting role, which I prefer to his later Oscar-winning role in ""Adaptation"". The younger actors (Thora Birch, Wes Bentley & Mena Suvari) hold their own though it isn't especially surprising to see that they haven't done much of note since.<br/><br/>The Oscar-winning direction by Sam Mendes is quite impressive coming from a first time director and the visuals are further bolstered by the Oscar-winning cinematography of Conrad Hall. Also noteworthy is the Oscar-nominated score by Thomas Newman which is supplemented by some well-chosen soundtrack selections.<br/><br/>The five Oscars and three additional nominations show that this film was a well-rounded effort. It is also one of the few Best Picture Oscar winners of recent years that few will dispute. Personally, I think that it is a fine film though I don't rank it quite as highly as the rest of IMDb's voters (ie. currently ranked #37 in the top 250)."
"delija84","9","0","2","12 February 2009"," almost perfect
","Kevin Spacey won an Oscar for his performance in American Beauty, but in my opinion he shouldn't be the only one. Anette Bening was stunning in her role as a appearance and control freak. Wes Bentley and Mena Suvari ( yes American pie cheerleader ) should be at least nominated for best supporting actor and actress. This movie has beautiful acting and directing ( two things that i put the most attention to it ).<br/><br/>The story is about Lester ( K.Spacey ) a frustrated man who is in middle criss and who decides that he will change his life and be more spontaneous to have more courage and to be more rebellious. Carolyn ( A.Bening ) is a saleswoman and she is obsessed with appearance and fake image. The two have a daughter Jane ( T.Birch ) who is typical teenager who is insecure and rebellious. She has a beautiful friend outside but ugly on inside and her name is Angela. She is also a teenager.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Lester decides to change his life when he meets Angela and a Ricky ( W.Bentley ). These two characters change his life because he falls in love in Angela and he starts to train because of her and also gets more courage to speak his mind to his wife and boss because of Ricky. Although marriage of Lester and Carolyn is in criss, he get's his libido back but his wife don't wanna have a sexual relationship with him. So he decides to flirt with Angela, but on the other hand Carolyn also has a lover. Jane then starts to hang more with Ricky and less with Angela so she becomes jealous and insecure because she is losing a friend who is underrated in compare to her. Angela gets her self-esteem in a way to put down other people. At the end Jane and Ricky become a couple and they decide to move to New York so they could get away from they parents. Ricky's father hates gay people because deeply inside he is confused about his sexual life so he beats and control his son. At the end Ricky's father kills Lester because he thinks that Lester has a asexual relationship with his son ( and my opinion is also because Lester refused his kiss on his first confession that he is gay ).<br/><br/>This movie has also a phenomenal score and screenplay. It is very entertaining movie with a lot of twists and unpredictable scenes. The best performance of Kevin Spacey ( although he get's close in Ussual Suspects and se7en ) and Annette Bening and of course Sam Mendez. It is almost perfect movie. The only thing is that is a little bit short ( i like epic movies ) and at the start of the movie is a too much regular.<br/><br/>Very recommended movie. 9/10"

","American Beauty really surprised me in every way. This was not the slow, bleak, Oscar-baity film I thought it would be. Boy, was it a lot more. I love the writing and story the film brought. It was a very enjoyable look at suburban life in a way. All the different stories each character has is so amazingly brought to life, with such real passion. The characters are all such memorable and fascinating . Kevin Spacey is just brilliant. His comedic act is so realistic and so well done, this is one of the best performances of the 90's. Anette Bening is just as spectacular. Her performance is so 3-dimensional. Both are well rounded performances, and all bring something original that we have never seen before. Thora Birch is great, Wes Bentley and his character are so brilliant and unique.<br/><br/>What I loved about this film is that it is such an enjoyable, heartbreaking, comedic, and satirical look at suburban life. It is also one of those rare gems that can be called entertaining. The cinematography is first-rate, the music is so well pitched for every scene. Overall, a very unforgettable motion picture.

","I struggled hard to write a summary line as well as a criticism of this show. I first saw this in the theaters in the fall of 1999,and would see it again some years later. The effect of this movie has haunted me ever since. I want to avoid using broad,philosophical,high-falluting language on this because 1)it sounds insincere 2)I don't think that I can truly say,from both an intellectual and/or emotional standpoint,can make those kinds of assessment of this movie and 3)there are LOTS of reviews/comments who already have. What I will say is that a show like this,replete with sly observation,world-weary,stripped-down approach and even gallows humor,would ALREADY be memorable with simply competent,unremarkable acting. So when Kevin Spacey,Annette Bening,Thora Birch,Chris Cooper,Wes Bentley,Peter Gallagher and Allison JAnney(among others)inhabit these characters,this show LEAPS over expectation.<br/><br/>I realize the phrase ""not everyone's cup of tea"" is overused to the point of being trite,but it really applies here,because I'm familiar with the fact that not everyone warmed up to the story of Lester Burnham(Spacey,well-worthy of his second Oscar and whatever awards he garnered),a forty-something married father of one who reaches an epiphany over his overly-routine,seemingly meaningless life in the suburbs. HIs wife Carolyn(Bening,only luckless enough to be stuck with HIlary Swank in Best Actress category),once a lovely,sexy bride has grown into an angry,uptight real estate agent who has become obsessed with climbing social ladders(mostly real estate related)and views her husband as a nothing much more than a deflated loser. His daughter JAne(BIrch,shedding much of the clean,cute ""kid""image she's developed to that point)has come to resent her sad-sack dad and is allured by the new kid next door,a dark,edgy boy(Wes Bentley,TOO good here)who quietly observes his family's behavior and sells pot...to JAne's dad among others. As this happens,Lester becomes infatuate with JAne's cheerleader peer/friend Angela(Mena Suvari,sweet,if maybe not entirely convincing),and his obsession with her,while it brightens his dull life,threatens to unravel the stability that has been carrying him and his family.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes directorial debut,and Alan Ball's script are at once,devastating,funny,insightful,cruel,sad,unfair and even optimistic(slightly). I'd go into why this film doesn't settle well with everyone,but I think from the basic summary or synapses one would be sufficiently clued in to why. Suffice it to say,I was intrigued,and I was satisfied,though I will say that the acting was to me more overall impressive than the movie's framework,which IS high quality,but personally hit a discordant note or two(and that's mostly an emotional criticism than a content one from me). That said,any interested parties should do,as the movie's tag-line beckons,to ""look closer"" at this offering."

","I don't want to boast, but I have seen every movie to win Best Picture since 'Wings' back in 1929, and this is probably my favorite winner in this century. 'American Beauty' is really a magnificent story, but it's more than that. It displays a dirty part of the world that we all know is there, but we just don't want to think about.<br/><br/>The dreary gray world that Lester Burnham lives in would make Tim Burton so very proud, but it's Kevin Spacey's ever creepy monotone voice that gives Lester his personality. The childish, stupid way that he changes himself to try and impress his daughter's alluring friend Angela is the focal point of most of the story, but not the main draw.<br/><br/>The reason this movie won Best Picture is because of Wes Bentley. Though he has almost no other desirable credits, Bentley's portrayal of Ricky, the insightful, eerie next-door neighbor, lights the movie aflame. And that scene. That single scene that gained so much mockery over these nine years-- it's what got me. Something as simple as a white, plastic bag floating up and down in the air, that's all this movie needed.<br/><br/>Annette Bening gives a shudder-worthy performance as the fed-up wife. But more than that was the absolutely chilling and spot-on Frank Fits, played by Chris Cooper. There are no words for that performance. The look on his face when his secret is revealed is something that stays with you forever, but that you awkwardly will try to suppress from your mind.<br/><br/>The ending is something so truly poignant and beautiful, something that, in attempting to state that nothing ever ends nicely and nothing is perfect, made the movie perfect. And I mean that. I've gone over it and over it, but I cannot find a single thing about this magnificent film that I would alter. Not a single thing."

","Lester Burnham's (Spacey) life is reawaken when he meets Angela Hayes (Suvari).<br/><br/>This 1999 Oscar winning picture is regarded as Mendes' finest and with a fine realistic styled direction it is easy to see why.<br/><br/>Dramas can often be ruined when a can of clichés is opened but Mendes keeps a grounded direction all the way through and uses a variety of techniques to achieve the ultimate shocking effect. From a simple but effective sweeping shot of the suburban residency to the artistic and now infamous fantasy sequences, Mendes maintains the realism in the film's context.<br/><br/>Alan Ball's Oscar winning script is superb. The conciseness of the character's lives is easy and relaxing to watch which, given the complexity of the situations, is genius. His grounded characters are well placed into a plot about such strong issues such as family, job, sexual orientation, love, lust and drugs. So where as many dramas tell a story they have no sub-story, but Ball's script has everything. Twists and turns, comedy, drama, not to mention an array of fascinating individual characters.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects) gives an Oscar winning performance as Lester, a man with nothing, who wants everything. Far from your typical mid life sufferer, Lester is a complex soul with his head on his shoulders. Lester is a man who anyone of any age can relate to. He is an outcast in his family, he is alone, he hates his job and he fantasises about his crush. These basic human emotions and impulses help viewers relate to the film and create a welcoming and comforting presence. He is also very funny to watch.<br/><br/>Annette Bening (The Grifters) is only second to Spacey in this Oscar nominated role as Lester's husband Carolyn. Her quirky and false character is interesting to watch, particularly when in scenes with her husband. These are some fine comedy and dramatic moments; watch out for the couch reference. The pair has created a very memorable marriage and one of the most intriguing in drama film history.<br/><br/>The young supporting cast of Birch, Bentley and Suvari is typical of teenage life and used to stunning effect. Ball puts a marvellous spin on the stereotypical 'ugly' girl and the 'popular' one too, and by not following conventional characters, American beauty is different and brilliant in its own unique way.<br/><br/>With its stunning direction, writing and characters, American Beauty has proved to be a timeless classic that not only entertains, but shocks and surprises."

It is a beautiful journey through the last weeks of Lester Burnham (Spacey) and as he announces that he will be dead in less than a year at the beginning of the film, the initial question is... 'Who kills Lester?' Yet as the story progresses, you realise how unimportant that question is. You will probably forget it as you are dazzled with the great cinematography and emotion filling characters; be it a sense of ""Well that was your fault, you tosser,"" towards Lester, ""Jesus, you're a bitch,"" towards his wife Carolyn (Bening), or whatever you think of the varied characters.<br/><br/>My advice: watch this film and enjoy it. It's spectacular."
"marlyly","9","0","3","4 October 2008"," A Seriously Messed Up View On Life...
","...But worryingly accurate at the same time. American Beauty is about Lester Burnham, a middle-ages man stuck in a marriage with a wife who he hates and a daughter who hates him. He feels ignored, under-appreciated,as if he is simply walking through life playing out the part, no emotions involved, never feeling anything. Then he meets his daughter's best friend, Angela Hayes, and the new kid next door, Ricky Fits, and inspired by both decides to start living again. Within a month he winds up dead.<br/><br/>What is so haunting about this film is that it is real - the characters, the emotions, the love and hatred - it's all taken from real life, everyone's experienced these things before, everyone knows someone who behaves like Carolyn, or Jane, or Frank etc. It is so bizarre to see this portrayed on film, blatant for all to see, when usually people try to hide the darker side of real life, either making cushy love stories, films about gangs and crime, or un-realistic horror films to scare people instead. The thing is, real life is so much darker.<br/><br/>The acting from all concerned is faultless. Kevin Spacey plays Lester to perfection - the viewer understands exactly what Lester is going through, you are on his side even if his actions are not what you would find morally correct. Annette Bening is incredible as Carolyn - you truly believe she is this insane, power-hungry perfectionist, and most importantly, at the end, you also truly believe that she did love her husband, despite everything. Wes Bentley played Ricky to the right level of creepy, still allowing the audience to connect with him, and Thora Birch and Mena Suvari play the two girls to perfection - unlike certain films that portray teenagers in a completely unrealistic way you could actually believe these girls were attending high school, their behaviour and speech was spot on.<br/><br/>This film is dark, sick, twisted, yet the ending is hopeful too (you'll know what I mean if you watch it). One of the greatest films of our time - a film to inspire you, as well as make you sit back and think, what kind of life are we living here. A must see!"

The cinematography, the music, the timing, the acting, everything seemed like it had come from up on high as if this were some divine power's look at a unhappy group of people desperately trying to make sense out of their lives. It builds up throughout the film bringing itself to an almost mystical catharsis.<br/><br/>What I like the most is how straightforward it is in presenting the dilemma: who are you? That is something each character must figure out. The problem is seeing whether or not who you are is conducive to living or merely surviving. Most people think they are living but they are not. That is what Lester Burnham comes to realize thanks to his new neighbor and his infatuation with his daughter friend. I also love how comfortable it is with the anti-heroes of the piece. We find ourselves rooting for them even though we probably wouldn't in real life. And that is the beauty of cinema, allowing ourselves to look through the eyes of a total stranger and discover ourselves in them."

","Where does beauty lie? Why do you find something beautiful that your closest friend dislikes? What is beauty itself? These are just some of the million questions that I have asked myself after viewing American Beauty, possibly for the 8th or the 9th time. In our daily lives, all we do is complain about all the things we don't have. But if we just ""look closer"", there is always beauty in every little thing. We just can't appreciate it all, because there is way too much beauty.<br/><br/>This movie has changed my life in ways I couldn't have possibly imagined. If I am in a train and bored, I just look around at all the people, or just stare at the running trees... And it is not just beauty in vision, even music that sounded ordinary before sounds better because I am able to appreciate it better.<br/><br/>The one scene that is totally out of this world is the flying paper bag scene.A lot of people don't seem to like it, but the minute I saw it, I felt goosebumps all over my body and it didn't stop until the scene was over.<br/><br/>There are so many aspects to this movie. I haven't even discussed the characters, the plot, the underlying satirical exaggeration. But, the only reason I gave it a 10 (the only other movie I have given 10 is Shawshank's Redemption) is simply because it has changed the way I perceive life. I live life by the day and at night, think of all the beautiful things that I saw or did or heard that day. And that gives me great satisfaction and a beautiful sleep..."

","'American Beauty' is an American masterpiece, albeit a flawed one. Director Sam Mendes has crafted a dark, brooding, and completely enveloping tale of a simple American family. Well, simple enough on the outside, anything but behind closed doors. Despite being alarmingly powerful and packing a harsh emotional punch, 'American Beauty' is sinfully funny with some of the best performances you're likely to ever see in cinema's rich history.<br/><br/>Spirituality remains an almost taboo subject for film today, and never has it been explored quite the way we see it in 'American Beauty'. At first glance, this can be mistaken as another skin-deep story of another dysfunctional family living in suburban America. But once you allow yourself to see all the layers that make up this heartbreaking film, this is anything but simplistic and unoriginal. Explosive drama and biting satire, 'American Beauty' shows us how beautiful life can be in the most horrible and shocking ways. But it works, and it works on nearly every level.<br/><br/>'American Beauty' wouldn't be half the film it is without the glorious acting talents of Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning. The seemingly happy couple whose marriage is actually falling apart at the seams. The performances are brilliant, Spacey in particular whose mid-life crisis opens him up to life-changing experiences. Smoking pot, buying a sports car, quitting your job. Spacey, one of Hollywood's best actors, pulls it off like none other and will leave you in stitches the way he underperforms his lines with biting accuracy.<br/><br/>Had it not been for Mendes, 'American Beauty' could have easily doused itself waist-deep in sticky melodrama. And even when it comes tantalizing close to crossing that line, Mendes is in the driver's seat to get us all back on course. It's a brilliant and edgy project which will undoubtedly challenge its viewers, but will definitely give them something to think about for a long time. There's a lot of beauty in this world, and 'American Beauty' paints a tragic portrait of a family on the verge of shattering.<br/><br/>More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"

","This movie's title, like that of every others, has no luring power and also is misleading. This movie is not about American Beauty, not even remotely.<br/><br/>I saw this movie 8 years ago when it first came out. I was in China. The reason I picked it was because it won the best movie of Oscar 2000. Yet, I didn't understand why it won after I finished it. I felt it was so dark and so depressing. What a weird man, twisted loser and is it the spirit we would like to promote in the US? I was getting ready to the country and I was even doubting about my choice because of this.<br/><br/>8 years later, I happened to see this movie again on HBO. After 8 years of exploring the culture of mixture, I found the strong connection with the author Alan E. Ball (No wonder, he is a gay according to my research) . I admire the bravery of the first time author to go against Hollywood mainstream, which is always about happy ever after, happy, happy.<br/><br/>He went inside an American dream life--a great neighborhood, a typical mid-class family and depicted what the life is really like, if you can call it a real life. I always have doubt about the seemingly ever-happy American lives and my findings make me want to puke--we have just too many pretentious people out there, just too many self-denials...In other word, most of smileys I saw are just too animated. Why can't they be true to themselves? It is okay to lack something and still pursuing your happiness...? Here, Alan told us all. Men burdened with boring jobs, and don't know where to go next, nothing motivate them or excited them, nothing for them to look forward to...women, gush, are overly animated and yet not happy at all...troubled teens, insecure and hate their parents...drug problems...Even more, outspokenly homophobia might turn out to be gay themselves, housewives are wordless and of course joyless..Families that look so happy from outside might be just a show, like Kevin spacer's character Lester Burnham says in the movie. They might just be hell! What I learned from the movie? Hey, we are not alone either enjoying or suffering ,not everyone else is the happiest but you! We should be so proud of ourselves because we are true to ourselves and we are seeking our joy in our lives, our own joys. They are not better than us even they, the pretentious people, pretend they do.<br/><br/>Good luck, pretentious people! When you kill yourself, make sure you pick up after yourself."
"Cristi_Ciopron","7","0","4","19 April 2008"," A phony manifesto against ugliness and falseness;fun watching,like a good TV series' episode
","Seen a second a time, and at another age, this film seemed quite phony and very overstated and over-explicit and unnecessarily smarti.e., smart in a way that only covers and hides and cannot overcome the trouble.<br/><br/>It is maybe a funny entertainment, an amusementit acknowledges, in a very overstated way, the ugliness and the phoniness of a society, and the need for beauty. But it's not really superior to the problems that it pretends it does unmask. It is smart and pretendedly agile in a MTV waythat is,the wrong way; and, most of all, it is obviously, stridently unsubtle and clamorous. Spacey gives one more time a powerhouse performance, something electrifying and worthy of a better usage.<br/><br/>It's not a creation, but a product. The theme needed a Truffaut, to give it the infinite dimension it requires.<br/><br/>One feels the director is surpassed by the amplitude of the subject, that required a real competence. Made as it has been, A. Beauty looks like one of the smart sitcoms that won so much acclaim. It pretends to denounce what is phony and unsubtle and ugly and void in the livesthe spleen and the neurosis. It explores several reactionssex, guns, drugs, career , vanity, etc.. It uncovers hidden contents of the ordinary lives. But everything in the product itselfthe bitterness, the perspicacity, the fun, the quickness, the intuition of splendorsis cheap, phony and banal and far from overcoming the object described. <br/><br/>Yet Spacey does a breathtaking role; the phony moments of poetry are though enjoyable and deserve being developed in another cinematographic project; Mrs. Benning is quite sexy; Mrs. Suvari's hips and thighs are gorgeous.<br/><br/>As such, the film is little more than a precipitation of ideas previously in solution in the very world it pretends to dissect."

","The thing that is most astounding about this film, is not the fact that this was the first film Sam Mendes ever directed, nor is it the extraordinary cast or magnificent cinematography. While these are all honorable assets to the film, the truly great thing about this film is its script. Not only is it flawless in its plot, character interactions, twists, etc. But it depicts what has now come to be known as American life, utterly, beautifully if I say so myself (no pun intended), and what I would compare to the classic play ""Our Town"" only built for modern day people. <br/><br/>Kevin Spacey, Annette Benning, Chris Cooper, Wes Bentley, and the rest of the cast are all phenomenal in every sense of the word. The direction and cinematography are precise and leave you forgetting that you're watching a movie (the mark of a good film). The movie is about Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), and his mid-life crisis, the people that surround him and ultimately, his death (I'm not ruining anything its said within the first 10 minutes of the movie). It begins by showing his life as a father whose teenage daughter hates him, a job he hates, and a wife who is wound a bit too tight. It also shows the new next-door neighbors, a worn-down mother, an Army Veteran, and a creepy teenage boy who likes video-taping Lester's daughter, Jane (Thora Birch). What ensues is an epic exploration into the human condition, into love (or hate), into inner beauty, and into what gives our lives true substance. This film is an immense success, and I'm sure it will be enjoyed and studied for years to come."
"sideburnmikeguitar","7","0","1","30 March 2008"," Self-aware, but pretty good anyway
","Almost every technical aspect of this movie was great. The story is compelling and original: there are other movies about mid-life crises, but this one is more complex and has several side plots that include the family and neighbors. The acting very good all around. Spacey is still just a little pushy, but it rarely gets in the way. The Ricky character is a bit overwrought. The pacing was excellent too, because the writing gave you just enough time to think about what you were seeing, or at least get your instinct involved. And of course, it's shot well. For those who think that sort of thing doesn't matter much, this movie will provide many great examples proving my point about the effect of good camera work to the average Joe.<br/><br/>Before you read the rest, keep in mind that I actually recommend this movie for the above reasons. They've all been covered in detail by many others I'm sure, and rightfully so. However, it often gets hyped as ""One of the best movies I've seen"" whenever anyone makes a list that goes beyond 5 movies. This is as much a reaction to that as it is a review.<br/><br/>There are some funny moments and some graphic ones. There's a good amount of tension and release. All this adds to the realism and is expertly portrayed by the relationships between parents and children and the parents themselves. My main problem with the film is the issue of self-righteousness which seems to be praised throughout. Lester's character is supposed to a hero, and that's fine. But he's a flawed one at least. I think the film tries to convey the opposite message. Selfishness abounds in this movie to the point where it becomes preachy. The message ""do what feels good"" were subtle enough to fool a lot of people into thinking there was more here than there really was. Tarantino would've had a gospel choir sing a song called ""do what feels good"" I think. Mendes was smarter than that.<br/><br/>Still, it's well worth watching, but make sure you're mature enough to see past the flaws. A man with Mendes' talent could've easily gotten rid of the preachy implications of Chris Cooper's next-door visit to Lester's garage (I don't want to give it away but you'll know when you see it). Ricky's emotive recount of how he felt filming the plastic bag is kind of vomit inducing too. But these small miscalculations really took a lot away from an otherwise great movie. It wouldn't have been so obvious and wouldn't have been so forceful on the modern existentialism, but it would've been more real as a result. It could've been a masterpiece. Should've been a contender."

","The 90's was an interesting decade for The Academy Awards Best Picture winners you have the bad like Dances With Wolves and Shakespere In Love and the great like Shindler's List and Forrest Gump. However If I had to choose one movie in this decade that stands out as the best one, it has to be American Beauty. American Beauty is a story that focuses on a dysfunctional family living in a suburban neighborhood. Kevin Spacy and Annette Benning are excellent as the unhappy middle-aged married couple with an odd ball daughter who falls for the boy next door who is pretty odd himself, also Kevin Spacy's character falls for his daughter's best friend a wild girl played by Mena Suvari. This is complete with a great story and great music, this in my opinion was one of the best movies that came out in over 20 years and a well deserved Academy Award Winner for Best Picture in 1999 and the best one of that decade. If you haven't seen this film yet please watch it you won't regret it."
"DonFishies","7","0","1","19 February 2008"," Without Spacey's dazzling performance, it would just be another pretentious and amateur glorified independent film
","Almost eight years since first seeing it, I still cannot fathom why everyone was so smitten with American Beauty. There is practically nothing about it that seems relevant as to why it won a smouldering amount of critical acclaim then, and still has yet to show me why it will stand the test of time as the years go on. Instead, it still is just frighteningly average.<br/><br/>Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is in a downward spiral. After years of living the good life, he has hit his midlife crisis. His wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), is straying away from him and is stuck in her own rut of depression, and his daughter Jane (Thora Birch) just seems to loathe his very existence. But after a new family moves in next door, and Lester meets Jane's gorgeous best friend Angela (Mena Suvari), he begins to turn his life around.<br/><br/>The plot description really does no justice for what little good there is in the film, but it does say what is wrong with it. It is just plain uninteresting and far from blazingly original. Breaking the film right down to its plainest terms, makes it just another story about redemption. Spacey's Lester just wants to be redeemed for everything that has happened and brought him to this moment in his life, and spends the whole movie seeking that one true thing. It never bothers lingering on what was wrong in the first place, and it never makes us truly understand why he needs to make such a radical change in his life, and rip up the family unit even more so on his way doing it. Much of what Lester does is not darkly comedic, satiric or even dramatic. It comes off instead as awkward and disturbing. There is a fine line to walk between both, but this film cannot do it. Instead, it falls flat on its face right from the start, and barely ever recovers.<br/><br/>First time director Sam Mendes and screenwriter Alan Ball set out to craft the perfect take on dystopic suburbia, but really are only half baking the whole thing. What some may have taken to be perfection at its very core is strictly pretentious. There is a lot of attention given to the vivid colours in the film (used obviously to show certain emotions), but the film's underlying messages are far too mixed for any of them to actually matter. The long, straying shots only help add to the confusion that sets in rather rapidly, and its attempts at genuinely effecting moments do nothing for it. It struck me most often as an homage to ideas from the past and present, but nothing more than that. The work done here is amateur at best, and bites off more than it could ever chew. Some of the dialogue is indeed very clever, but the majority either comes off as useless or just a sheer attempt at being powerful. It only drags the movie out even further. And do not even get me started on that silly plastic bag.<br/><br/>But while the filmmakers and the film itself meanders a bit too often, Spacey is actually quite uncompromising in his performance. He has yet to do anything since (Se7en and The Usual Suspects notwithstanding) that even remotely compares to it (unless you count his wonderfully narcissistic and deliciously evil take on Lex Luthor in Superman Returns), and I doubt he ever will. Spacey paints Lester as a closeted basket case beautifully, and at times, rises well above the screenplay and the film's limitations. He has just the right amount of dry wit and dramatic tendencies to pull off such a brilliantly written character. His voiceovers, as ridiculously pretentious as they slowly become, are reassuring and at times, poetic. His zany performance is calculating and brilliant. Never once do we as the audience see an actor, we see a man whose life is slowly deteriorating all around him. The only problem is, he outshines everyone around him, and manages to completely spell out how Ball managed to completely sidestep writing anyone else nearly as good (or just left them to the audience's own enigmatic devices). All of the other actors do as best as they can to overcome this hindering, but Spacey's presence is felt throughout, and all of the actors show it in their performances whether he is on-screen or not. They may as well have been mimes.<br/><br/>I digress however. The film is nice on the eyes, especially when not in the dark or through the lens of a worthless videocamera disguised as a unique plot device. The score is also fairly well done. And the comeback story that takes place always makes for a rather enchanting picture (albeit one that has been told far too many times).<br/><br/>But American Beauty's pretentious over and undertones drag it down into just being merely watchable, if only to witness Spacey chew up and spit out every last ounce of scenery and character moments. He never lets up once, and singlehandedly does the film some form of justice. There is nothing to look closer at. It is just another overpraised film that seemed relevant at the time, but has slowly began to die off since. I wish it was only Spacey's performance that won awards instead of the entire movie. It did not deserve any of its accolaids.<br/><br/>7/10."

","OK, I would love to go into great detail of how mesmerising and powerful American beauty is, however there are that many good things I have to say about this film I could not just simply cram them all into some IMDb comment, however I will quickly brainstorm just a few things to why I think this film should be remembered for all time and to why (in my opinion) it is simply one of the most moving, powerful and beautiful films ever made in history. American beauty portrays the hatred, sadness, frustration(sexual and emotional)and the hidden happiness that lurks in the depths of American suburbia. With killer performances off Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening and Wes Bentley this film does not fail to show some of the best acting I've ever seen in a film. Deep, powerful scenes are also a huge advantage of this film for example, Wes Bentley's monologue of how there is so much beauty in the world. The film, especially towards the end, contains a series of unexpected twists that will shock and grip the viewer to the very last emotionally charged scene. American Beauty is a rare treat and must be remembered. Phenomenal."

"plopmasterj","8","0","1","6 October 2007"," A messed up but interesting film
","I first saw this on CineMax earlier this year. I originally wanted to see the film for Thomas Newman's score. While I was watching, I couldn't help but feel awkward throughout the whole film. Every character in the film had some secret they were hiding from the rest of the world. This idea intrigued me. The film stars Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham, a depressed, bored man going through a mid-life crisis brought on by his work-obsessed, perfectionist, crazy wife, Carolyn (played by Annette Bening) and his angry and insecure daughter, Jane (played by Thora Birch). Lester and Carolyn go to a basketball game to see Jane perform a cheer-leading routine. Afterward, they meet Jane's ""best friend"", Angela Hayes (played by American Pie's Mena Suvari). She is a seemingly confident girl who constantly brags about her apparent sexual appeal to guys. We find out later in the film that she's not as confident with herself as she appears to be. Lester develops an infatuation with Angela the moment he meets her. He decides to turn his life around now that he found something to live for. In the midst of all this, Carolyn begins an affair with real estate business rival, Buddy Kane, an annoying, egotistical man who, as fate would have it, turns out to be just what the doctor ordered for Carolyn and her stressed-out life. Jane develops an attraction towards the strange but rather lovable Ricky Fits, the son of an overly strict and controlling former marine colonel who claims to be homophobic, and his mentally weak and submissive wife. Ricky is the one to make the first move on Jane by filming her every time he sees her. Jane and Ricky find that although they come from completely different family backgrounds, they actually have quite a bit in common. Ricky is someone who finds beauty in almost everything he sees, especially Jane. He also tells things like they are. The film traces the life of Lester as he makes his drastic life-change and deals with the consequences of his actions later on. His new changes do affect the people around him. He begins to anger his daughter further and even intimidates her once or twice. He no longer will take his wife's belittling words and work-obsessed ways. He becomes more open to Angela near the end of the film. He is able to form a friendship with Ricky comfortably without worrying about how his family will react. He basically becomes more confident and free-willed. Apparently, so does his wife. She begins to do what she wants to do, but immediately loses that feeling when Lester finds out about her affair with Buddy Kane. Although the film is put into the comedy genre and does have some funny parts, it is also a hard-hitting drama. It has some very tense, disturbing, and beautiful moments. There is a dark undertone to the film, which is emphasized at the end. I like this movie because it's very realistic. It shows that within a seemingly perfect, normal neighborhood, home, and family, there are things that nobody wants or needs to know about. Dark secrets that could undo the ""perfection"" of everything. I also like it because it adds humor to an otherwise dark and sad story. It's a good blend that deserves every Oscar it got. If you're looking for a funny comedy with gross-out humor like ""Superbad"", you will be disappointed in that this film is not entirely a comedy and only has a few funny moments. If you're looking for a film that is funny but also has drama and is realistic, this is the film for you. Kevin is absolutely amazing in this movie. He deserved his Oscar for the role. Check out this film. I don't think you will be disappointed. 8/10 stars"

The music was perfect, cinematography and everything was perfect. We know why Kevin Spacey is one of the best actors of all time. I would like to see what else Alan Ball is capable of and may just watch six feet under just because he in involved.

"Det_McNulty","8","0","1","10 June 2007"," Bringing Life To The Silver-Screen. ""American Beauty"" Skilfully Succeeds As A Film Almost Anyone Can Relate To
","Winner of Best Picture in 1999, American Beauty is perfection in the form of the lives we lead. Built with precision, accuracy, honesty and beauty there is no denying the film's naturalistic nature in depicting life, and how so many people lead their lives by consumerism, materialism and denunciation. Not only has American Beauty gained huge popularity around the world, but it has also benefited from large amounts of critical acclaim. American Beauty is a film which should be mentioned alongside the greatest debuts in cinema, as the director Sam Mendes was a British stage-director who gained the opportunity to bring to life, what is ultimately a personification of today's world. <br/><br/>Meet Lester Burnham (performed by Kevin Spacey), a man just like so many others, a man who has been distanced by society and has become inconsequentially shunted to one side. His wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening) and daughter Jane (Thora Birch) are also having their own fair share of personal dilemmas and are struggling to cope with the insignificance of their lives. Lester decides that drastic action needs to turn his mundane mid-life around, so he takes a form of ""resurrection"" by living his life in the way he wants to live it and accomplishing the freedom most men dream of. Instantly recognisable and indisputably distinctive, American Beauty taps inside the average person's day-to-day mendacity and portrays suburbia in all its heartless, yet beautifully oblivious glory. <br/><br/>There are times in everyone's lives where you just want to break free. Which is what American Beauty is primarily about; how we all want to be spontaneously alive and not let others manipulate our actions, but instead become driven by personal compulsion. Having the desire to become an individual is what makes us human, which is one of the reasons why American Beauty has become ""the people's film"". Driven by its audacious energy and satirical humour the film blends and distinguishes what makes us human. <br/><br/>Framed in a technique which subconsciously approaches beauty through heartache, American Beauty quietly compels its viewer inside a world which is remarkably familiar. Built on Alan Ball's (writer of the television series Six Feet Under) lyrical script the film becomes both brutally honest and poetically surreal. The script is paced in a way which helps the film shift with graceful timing, letting the performers delve inside their multi-dimensional characters. Packed with sarcastic wit, brutal sincerity and a tender edge, Alan Ball crafts the script with fantastic ease, letting everything flow with a delicate, yet sharply dry rhythm. The ability to craft American Beauty as an epic study of life through fantastically entertaining storytelling is something I admire.<br/><br/>The fluid editing and brilliantly controlled narrative crafts the film with a refined periphery. The use of jump-cuts, stylistic moulding and atmospheric lighting all help to make the film a pure joy to watch. Then you have the incredible cinematography, which blends fantasy and realism with an elusive ease. The gentle cinematography is, quite literally, beautiful, with its fluid motions and glossing visual deception. Also, the use of lens differentiation, wide lens takes and long takes highlight the characters' emotions; with the addition of the lighting everything feels so special. I adore the use of metaphorical imagery, such as the reoccurring bars to represent Lester being ""caged"" in a fake environment. Plus, there is a remarkably haunting image of characters being reflected through mirrors, which is one of the important themes of American Beauty. All this is played against Thomas Newman's majestic and unforgettable score, which subconsciously buries itself inside the back of the viewer's mind. <br/><br/>I find it extraordinary just how every single actor and actress adopts all the mannerisms, enabling the ability to construct complex characters. From facial expressions to hand movements, every action can be felt. Kevin Spacey embodies the role of Lester Burnham with concise relativity and bitter openness, becoming the everyday man living a fragile existence. Kevin Spacey also proves his brilliance through even the subtlest elements, such as the poignant voice-over he gives at both the beginning and end of the film. Annette Bening also gives a glaringly accurate portrayal of a self-absorbed woman who has been turned into a ""bitch"" by the desire to fit in with society's stereotypes. Even the young performers give some of the most memorably true-to-form performances I have had the pleasure of viewing. Desperation and loss has rarely been dealt with such a harsh amount emotional realism. Even when the film is bursting with entertainment and wit, there is always an underlying tone of sadness. <br/><br/>What American Beauty says is not exactly happy, but it is unbearably honest, being that we are all victimised (in some form) by the society we live in. Yet, American Beauty is outstandingly uplifting, in the sense that the film says that it is possible to be content with the lives we lead. American Beauty is a masterpiece, which brings theatre and disheartening pragmatism with an overwhelming calm and tender sense of beauty. A film which could possibly change your life, or at least your perceptions on it."

","American beauty is one of those film that makes you think. It's got words of wisdom along with wit.<br/><br/>American Beauty is the story of Lester, acted superbly by Kevin Spacey. lester is depressed and his wife, played by the also superb Annette Benning, isn't much help. After becoming infatuated with his daughter's best friend, he quits his job, starts working out to look better, and lives life care free.<br/><br/>American Beauty is very well written and the acting is first class.

"mera_bullar","9","0","1","16 May 2007"," Spectacular, as good as a drama gets
","This movie is probably my favorite movie of all time in terms of how enjoyable it is. It is as powerful as Reqiuem for a dream but instead of depressing, it takes a easy-going approach to life's serious matters. It is probably the funniest movie I know. Though it has a serious plot and both sad and tragic scenes, it is the movie I watch if I want a good laugh. It really gives you the feeling that you want to go out and live life afterward.<br/><br/>You follow Lester Burnham, Kevin Spacey, who is bored with his life and sort of has a middle life crisis which he during the movie is getting out of. To see how his attitude to life changes is actually the main plot of the movie.<br/><br/>However, it has several side plots. You follow the whole Burnham family and their neighbors, the Fits, and both families are totally screwed up. Jane Burnham is a confused teenager trying to find her identity, and she will get involved with her new neighbor, Ricky Fits, who is very much controlled by his military gay-hating dad. <br/><br/>You will see their relation develop throughout the whole movie. Also, Jane has a friend, Angela Hayes, who is a extremely shallow (and you can figure out she is insecure) 18-year old with the dream of becoming a model. She represents the fear of being ordinary and she is also important in the development in both Jane's and Lester's characters (she wakes Lester up and he falls in love with her).<br/><br/>You will also see Carolyn Burnham, Lester's wife, finding her way through her real estate business with the local real estate king Buddy. They both stand for the ""career-focused and materialistic fake"" American attitude. Lester Burnham is the total opposite, a slacker who does exactly what he feels like. You can easily figure out their marriage is not working.<br/><br/>So through his characters, Sam Mendes illustrates extreme moods in the American lifestyle - the slacker (Lester Burnham), the materialist (Carolyn Burnham & Buddy the King), the existentialistic loner (Ricky Fits), the confused teenagers with boob-job dreams (Jane Burnham & Angela Hayes) and the gay-hating marine corps officer Mr Fits (and his wife is just totally depressed).<br/><br/>However, the movie doesn't any standpoint which attitude it the best - instead, you should figure out what kind of person you are and what your goals are. Obviously materialistic fundamentalism isn't great but as long as you know who you are and what makes you happy you should take all opportunities to shape your own character. It's simple, yet, many people don't really get it, do they?<br/><br/>Aside from all this, the picture, the dialog and the acting are all just fabulous. Especially the Lester Burnham dialog and the Burnham parent's acting are spectacular. The first half of the movie I laugh the whole time, while the second half is more melancholic and deep. American Beauty is basically like watching what life is about. Me and my friend rented it so many times we broke the DVD (and I still haven't purchased it - how stupid is that?), probably twelve times, and the movie is as good every time.<br/><br/>Many people might not like this because of the explicit and awkward scenes (actually they are never really awkward, just very funny), but if you are a person who can't see a sex scene, maybe realism isn't your thing really."

The actors are at the top of their game and bring life to this frightfully honest tale.The honesty brought forth in this movie is what makes it so beautiful, presenting humanities flaws and how we manage to put up a facade of perfection, and how the impossibility of ""perfection"" strikes our core-not allowing us to be honest to ourselves.It is a deep film that you can enjoy and may change your perception on life."

","Am I tough or what? But seriously, isn't it the most overrated film since Citizen Kane? I've seen some movies over the years, read some books, listened to some music, and so on, but the more I tried while watching and re-watching it, the more I realized American Beauty was a bit forced. They were trying too hard, and that refers sometimes even to that bunch of good actors, too, who haven't really been able to save some too unreal moments in the script. It has some good ideas and scenes, but they sink in the pretentious, leveling dullness. In fact, besides their particular dramas, all characters are more or less alike (frustrated), and the fancy obsession with recognizing beauty in everyday life (to clean a bit the sad story) was not that convincing. Well, that's me, sorry, I need more. Good for those who really liked it."

","I don't know how many times I've watched this movie. Seven, at least. Probably once a year since it came out. The first time I saw it, I realized I had seen something profound... that's very, very rare. Not only is the story line engrossing, but so are all of the performances. There is not one weak link. But it is the dialog which drives the movie, as it should for people who want to think. No car chases, cats jumping out of closets, animated space ships with wooden characters or people riding brooms. Just words...words which lead to cataclysmic consequences for our protagonist. It's the way of the world. Words are what drive our lives in whatever direction we choose, if we're lucky or doom us if we're not. The wonderful irony of this movie, besides all its other attributes, is that Burnham is executed (for that's what it is) not for any of his foibles, nor his confronting his wife for her vapid existence or confronting her for her infidelity, nor for his romancing what surely must be an underage cheer leader, nor for the hatred professed by his daughter toward him, nor for blackmailing his employer... no he's killed because the father of the next door boy thinks he's gay and finally confronts his own homosexuality, makes advances to Burnham, is rebuffed and can't handle it."

"teacherlogan","10","0","1","21 February 2007"," The Beauty of change. A beautiful film.
","I saw American Beauty in the theater long before the ""award season"" buzz and accolades from the Academy stamped the film as an elite achievement. I came away from that evening knowing I had seen something special. A slice of American cinema that was as tender and caring as it was dark and disturbing (but in a good way). It takes the suburban family and turns it on its head. And in doing so, makes us think about the inescapable need for change.<br/><br/>This film chronicles the life of an unhappy, middle-aged man. He has a dead end job, a loveless marriage and a teenage daughter who hates him. He is a nobody. He apologizes when a party guest doesn't remember him. ""I wouldn't remember me, either."" Not many of us would. He is at a crossroad in his life. But, unlike many of us, he takes a turn.<br/><br/>In what can only be termed a mid-life crisis, he quits his job, buys an expensive little roadster, begins working out and smoking pot (thanks in no small part to the new neighbor's entrepreneur son). He begins to feel more confident, in some respects because he has decided he has nothing left to lose. While we do not always agree with his methods, as an audience, we applaud his motives. He is desperate for change. We relish his transformation as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey is one those actors that can make a movie worth seeing. The passion he brings to each role is refreshing. He can be dominating, even overbearing, yet reserved and endearing. And he is a wonderful story teller. It is no coincidence that his two Academy Award winning roles were The Usual Suspects and American Beauty. Those stories are his stories. He leads us on journeys where we are anxious to get to the next chapter. We follow his lead.<br/><br/>The fact that this film is Sam Mendes' first feature film is a tremendous achievement. In the coming years, he will make some good films, but nothing the caliber of American Beauty. The use of shadow and light is expertly done. Dream sequences, which can seem absurd if not pulled off right, add a sensual layer to the film. No one will forget the scene of the plastic bag fluttering in the wind. Though, as an audience, we give credit for that beautiful scene to Wes Bentley, Mendes did direct it. There are a lot of subtle scenes like that which only add to the excellence of this movie.<br/><br/>The best quality of American Beauty is that most of the characters seem to be in a better place at the end of the film than they are at the beginning. A couple characters are not, and their inability to change leads to the downfall of others. While this movie is not exactly uplifting, it leaves us believing that in the midst of transition and upheaval positive change can come. We do not see a lot of positive change through a bulk of this film. But the last moments leave us with a sense of serenity, amid chaos. A perfect combination of joy and loss. These themes are woven into this film in a way that at times makes no sense. Such colliding emotions cannot possibly co-exist. Until you step back and appreciate the entire creation. The realization becomes clear. Amid the ecstasy and pain, love and hate, American Beauty is a truly beautiful film."

"ColtSeavers","10","0","2","20 January 2007"," The best movie I have ever seen
","""American Beauty"" is simply the best movie ever made. The photography is wonderful, the acting is great, the music is haunting and unique, and, most of all, the script by Alan Ball is fantastic. You would probably expect that after about 100 years of movie making, every topic has been dealt with a hundred times already. How surprising then, that in 1999 it was still possible to make a film about something that has rarely, if ever, been a movie theme, and still touches most viewers very personally: Sensitivity.<br/><br/>You need to be sensitive in order to fully appreciate this movie. Only then you will be able to identify with Lester's development, and see why Caroline's is a fake one. You will also understand what touches Ricky so much in the key scene (the one with the plastic bag), and Lester's final words at the end of the film.<br/><br/>American Beauty works on many levels. As a comedy, as a criticism of society, and as a lesson in how to rediscover your vitality. You will laugh, you will feel tension and rage, but in the end, you'll recognize that it was all about something completely different. Not about the characters' ""stupid little lives"".<br/><br/>The movie is constantly surprising the viewer, by shattering preconceived expectations. Most importantly, the ""psycho"" next door, who was in a mental institution, who deals drugs (both among the worst American nightmares), turns out to be the savior in the end. He is the one who knows about true beauty. ""American Beauty"" is not about what most people in the world would first associate with the title - a superficial, arrogant cheerleader-type girlie like Angela Hayes. Rather, it's about the beauty that is in the simplest of things, and in yourself. Angela's beauty lies not in her aspirations of becoming a model, and her having ""been in Seventeen once"". It lies in her being insecure, an inexperienced virgin, who, in the end, admits how fearful she is. The most stunning thing, and I am sure that the makers were completely aware of this twist, is that this is a Hollywood movie."

","As far as debuts go, they can impress cinema goers to see more from that director, such as Tarintino's Reservoir Dogs, and Orson Welles' Citizen Kane- although that one took some time thou! Now we have another one to add to our favourite directorial debut lists, as Sam Mendes directs one of the most memorable modern dramas, in an era filled with effects laden blockbuster epics.<br/><br/>American Beauty, for those who have yet seen this yet, is, if you boil it down to the basics, about a middle aged father going through a mid-life crisis- and what a crisis it is too, as he has fallen in love with a high school cheer leader. But haven't we all seen films involving a mid-life crisis narrative before? Yes, but not like this!<br/><br/>Beautiful shot scene by scene, Mendes is a director who knows how to make the most of the camera for cinematic impact; whether it comes to either directing video camera footage of a plastic bag, to that renowned dream sequence- yes, this is the one with partially naked girl on the ceiling of rose petals! Mendes also knows how to get the most of his cast, in particular Kevin Spacey in the main role- when you though he outdone himself in the Usual Suspects, then you should see him in more dramatic action in this film.<br/><br/>One of the things that this film does is to have an original message- and it is not something along the lines of not getting sidetracked in your marriage! The universal message of seeing ""beauty"" in everything around you with definitely bedazzled film goers alike- either that or they start starring with burning passion at plastic bags blowing in the wind!<br/><br/>Having seen all of Mendes' current outings at the silver screen, the intriguing comic book adaptation Road to Perdition and the excellent war biopic Jarhead, American Beauty will definitely be the one he will be most remember for with great reasons: Kevin Spacey's finest performance since the Usual Suspects, the picture perfect cinematography, the fascinating message of ""beauty"", and reinventing the mid-life crisis movie forever. Also, this film, like most classics, has memorable usage of music, and definitely one of the best, and memorable, directorial debuts in this recent chapter of movie history."

","Angela Hayes is the typical concept of an American Beauty, blond hair and blue eyes and projects an image of modernity and of liberation. She has an image of a slut. She goes around telling her friends that she has done it with a photographer. After all, according to her that's the way it is done. She likes the attention. It is her way of rising up to the mediocrity. If she walks in to a room and people stare at her it gives her the confidence to believe that indeed she is beautiful. It assures her that is neither ordinary nor boring and can there for be a model like what she always dreamed of. Angela's confidence on herself is a mere fictitious impression of what it is really she wants to become. Yet, Angela is really vulnerable.<br/><br/>Lester Burnham, father of Jane, friend of Angela became infatuated with Angela after seeing her for the first time cheer dancing. He already had a sexual desire for her. That instant attraction somehow made a U-turn in Lester's life. At first he wanted to know more about Angela. He began making calls then hanging up. Then he over hear a conversation that Jane and Angela was having. Angela finds him cute and thinks he needs to work out. Lester then wanted to look good naked. He began jogging everyday and lifting weights. He wanted Angela to feel what it was that he was feeling, that sexual desire. He wanted to look good for her. H wanted to be beautiful so that he can get into Angela's pants. <br/><br/>Lester began realize to the things around him are not like what it used to be. His family was not one that was happy. His wife was a self-centered career woman and he was not anymore talking to his daughter. They were not in like in the pictures where they were smiling. His wife and his daughter always got what they wanted and nobody seemed to take notice of him anymore. He doesn't complain about what they were doing. He was tired of it. He relieved his youth first by quitting his high paying job for work at a fast food chain then buying himself a sports car. A Pontiac Firebird, a car which his cousin had when he was younger, something he always wanted. <br/><br/>Lester desires for Angela was coming to life one night when he found her crying. Lester comforted her. As the sexual tension heats up, Angela told Lester that it was her first time. Lester finely saw the innocence in Angela. She was just like Jane still a child in many ways. In the end Lester realizes that Carolyn and Jane are the beauty that is in his life already. He was contented with the things he had in life.<br/><br/>Jane is a brunette girl who is usually with Angela. Ricky Fits their new next door neighbor seems to be always filming her. Jane is interesting for Ricky; she is beautiful, a solemn girl who lives next door. At first, when he films her appears to be irritated but when she turns her back and he looks closer she is smiling. She likes it. <br/><br/>Ricky's concept of beautiful is whatever that is can be seen in this world. He is able to look beyond that traditional notion of beauty and finds it in uncommon places. Like a dead bird or plastic bag, he sees things life in perspective as beautiful. He lives not by aesthetic subjectivism. What one person can find ugly, another may find as attractive. It is like God looks through him as he sees beauty. That's why he films things in his everyday. <br/><br/>Time moves forever in one direction and it cannot be stopped. In a physical sense the past and the future don't exist. Everything we do, everything we achieve, every bit of happiness we experience -- they are all eventually buried in the past by time. Recording subjective beauty is a way by which one can challenge to recover beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty. <br/><br/>The blond girl and the black haired are the two comparisons between the two types of beauty. Angela's notion of herself as attractive is stereotypical of those blond and blue eyes. She fixes herself and brags to Jane how many times she has done it with guys and stuff; giving surety of herself of how good she really looks and making more Jane insecure. Jane however does not care about her looks. Jane finds consolation with Ricky and also finds out they have a lot in common. Ricky who sees much beauty in this world also sees her as beautiful. <br/><br/>The title of the movie ""American Beauty"" gives a metaphor to a kind of rose. It is a type of rose to represent beauty. Beauty is seen through one's point of view. The blond hair and blue eyes is Lester's concept of beauty. In reality beauty is everywhere. The film presents a deeper meaning to the word beauty. It seems like each character had a meaning with in them with a fantasy that needs to be realized."

","This film is a gripping and disturbing look at the breakdown of the modern American family structure. It hit so close to home for me and undoubtedly for anyone else raised in suburbia in the past two decades. In high school I used to walk out of my cookie cutter house after witnessing a pair of two irrational parents argue about the most ridiculous, trivial things and wonder if this was normal, while staring at the other cookie cutter homes along the street, and I thought, were a lot of other teenagers walking out of their front doors wondering the same thing? Aside from the the truths brilliant writer Alan Ball has brought to light, there are so many aspects of this film that are just beautiful, from the color red being used for symbolism and dramatic affect with the rose petals, the red front door, and Lester's blood streaming bright red across the table. As dark as this movie is, it can also be extremely funny. In the end, the feeling I was left with the most is just how important our lives and interpersonal relationships are, and that we should step back sometimes and make sure or vision is not getting clouded from what is really important. Being able to say at the end of the day that your life is a beautiful one, in all of it's mistakes and all of it's regrets, because all life is beautiful, and we should treasure it."

Films that have social messages are always going to be worthwhile but American Beauty hits a little deeper. From Lesters infatuation with his daughters best friend to his wife's sordid sex affair. Society always judges a book by its cover, as long as children have nice clothes then there parents must be doing a good job, but this film shows that you have to 'look closer' to see the full picture. Don't judge people before you get to know them and always try to see the bigger picture of life. A perfect piece of cinema which deserves to be in the top 10 as far as social prevalence is concerned.

With this wonderful script, first-time director Sam Mendes brings us a movie that is extremely funny at times, while in the end it might bring some tears to your eyes. Kevin Spacey plays this midlife-crises troubled man so ironically but honestly at the same time, it's just great. But also the rest of the cast is awesome: Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, Chris Cooper, they all deliver outstanding performances. ""I don't think that there's anything worse than being ordinary"", Mena Suvari's character says once. If there is one thing that ""American Beauty"" is not, it's normal."

Instead, I'll let you in on a lil' something...This gem... (although extremely well received and honored w/ nominations & awards), no, this gem of a movie is one that you can claim for yourself and it could be your very own cult classic, as this is one of those movies that should have become a nationwide, culture-wide and generation-less cult-classic immediately...However, because it's soo smart, it may not have had the chance...and now, unless you catch it on a Sunday afternoon TV movie filler, you may overlook it on the Blockbuster shelf (when all the new releases are already checked-out & you're milling through the decent movies of the last decade)...Instead, grab it like a 100 dollar bill blowin' in the wind...And especially if you've never seen it, oh man, then you're in for a treat and a half. It's one of those movies that is such a pleasure to watch ('to experience', is a better description) that if you have seen it you wish you could catch a case of temporary amnesia so you could watch it for the first time, uh...again. Seriously, if you've never seen this one, then by all means, get your best movie hunny-bunny and really make it a night, get the popcorn, the goobers, drinks, (everything you'll need) together, because you won't wanna' miss a moment of this great flick's quality or Spacey's commentary & performance...It's a very artful (without being artsy), well shot, well art directed, giant slice of someone's (and in a way, everyone's) life. I only wish that Hollywood or anywood would bring together such a solid story, quality movie-making talent combined with perfectly acted-acting a bit more often...It's the kindov' movie that leaves you changed slightly in the way you think about time, life and the relationships we love, hate and feel indifferent about...Yep, for a time afterwards, you'll feel (and probably be) just a bit different - after American Beauty...Who knows, it may end up being your very own, personal (& smart) cult-classic..."

","Amazing....one of my favorite movies. A movie about American families can only be produced by a non American director (in this case, sam Mendes - from the UK). while presumably written by an American, Mendes captures what is wrong, not just with US families, but many western families, and with people in general. It is this that is hard hitting, and touches you in this movie....when you realise how completely flawed modern society is....and for no really good reason. This movie is about the rut. Lester is in the rut, as many of us are. The difference is, he has a revelation and breaks out of it...while many of us don't. Go see this movie, you'll shake a bit, but if it may shake up your life and get you not to take things for granted anymore."

","Rewatched this today after it was replayed on the telly. Wasn't a massive fan of the movie when it came out, but back in '99 I preferred zany comedies and movies with machine guns.<br/><br/>The movie follows a family out of control. The dad (Spacey, in a great performance) has had enough of being pushed around by his wife and his work. His wife (Bening) is sick of her unfulfilled life. The daughter is sick of her family. The daughter has a friend (Suvari) who has men issues and also a neighbour who is creeping her out. The movie gets in motion as the dad starts turning into a different person. He quits his job, stands up to his wife, starts smoking pot and starts working out. His actions have a chain reaction on his family and their lives all change dramatically.<br/><br/>The movie has several interesting themes, and leaves a few things for the viewer to ponder. A refreshingly different, deep movie, if not at times a bit too arty for the sake of art (eg the plastic bag scene). Well worth a watch, but be prepared for a few uncomfortable moments. Some very funny moments courtesy of Spacey."

The less mature actors Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari and Thora Birch provide strong support, but it is Sam Mendes direction which frames the actor's as if the whole film was a bunch of beautiful photographs.<br/><br/>All in all, an amazing film, which you can challenge, and look a little deeper."

","American Beauty is resoundingly triumphant in everything it wants to be. It is flawless. It would have been a shame if a great film had not been made Alan Ball's outstanding script. Sam Mendes and a great cast succeeded in making a film that should be long remembered. <br/><br/>The 'midlife crisis' theme has been done many times but never this well. Spacey is magnificently dry as the subdued Lester Burnham, trying to regain his lust for life. The crazy situations he begins putting himself into are a source of regular hilarity. This is some of the best black comedy you will ever see but the film has much more to offer. The exploits of the teenagers are equally fascinating. Lester's disgruntled and confused daughter Jane (Thora Birch) and her beautiful but shallow friend Angela (Mena Suvari) make for two contrasting stereotypes of suburban teenage girls. Ricky, a thoughtful and sensitive boy living under the controlling grip of his father shows them how different they really are . The interaction of these characters is thought-provoking and the film does not pull any punches in depicting the issues they face.<br/><br/>American Beauty is stark and brutally frank portrayal of the 'American Dream' gone wrong. Perfectly acted and stunningly photographed by the late Conrad Hall, it stands above other quality films on this subject such as The Ice Storm and Ordinary People."

I know everyone has some hang ups and problems but the movie industry would lead you to believe that nobody can function without adultery, using drugs, screaming filth at each other, and of coarse shooting each other. This one even has a man chasing after a teenage girl. That's wonderful! And let us not forget the gay couple next door and the gay want-a-be on the other side. Whatever happened to ""Spencer's Mountain"" type drama. They had troubles but nothing like these people. Let's get together as a society and let everyone know we want decent movies.

The best thing about the film is its music, it sets the mood of the scene and its just great music to hear. The dark comedy is brilliantly pulled off by the whole cast of the film particularly Kevin Spacey who before this I had never seen a film with him in before. The ending is the perfect conclusion and finish for the film, you cant say for every film you watch that its worth getting to the end but you cant stop watching and when you get to end everything is wrapped up for you in one swoop.

","American Beauty is a readily-molded drama up for Academy praise. It occasionally feels forced; it has a lot of clichés, and it is over-hyped. However, it is still a very good film that brings up important issues and it leaves me touched and emotional every time I watch it.<br/><br/>The musical score was excellent, because it did not fit the scenes to which it was scored. This gave rise to a curious effect in which the background music grew so loud and strange you had to stop to listen to it. The roses are recurrent throughout the film and used in symbolic ways. For instance, when seen in connection with Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), the roses are free flowing petals to represent free passion in love. In contrast, when they are seen in connection to Carolyn (Annette Benning) they are tightly bound up in bouquetsrestricted and up for show, representing a love that is more about putting up a show than about expressing love. What makes American Beauty a modern masterpiece is not its good use of symbolic flowers, but its elements of humour. They are very subtle and well-handled but enough to label this film a Drama Comedy of some sorts. It would have been far too heavy without comedic relief.<br/><br/>I am still torn about the plastic-bag-blowing-in-the-wind-scene that that Ricky kid caught on tape and I suspect I will always be. Yes, it is pretty neat bringing up ""there's so much beauty in the world"", but ultimately it is too sappy for me to take. American Beauty's inherent flaw is its sappiness. It is too cliché. Yes, it deliberately points to clichés in everyday American life but it is not devoid of its own clichés in doing so. It's almost hypocritical. I give this film a strong 8 for the emotional impact is causes and the overall good execution of ideas."

The misunderstandings, the frustration, the doubt, the pressure of perfection, the fantasies...<br/><br/>John Cheever's short story The Country Husband is about a suburban man who is slowly feeling his energy and life slip away, bored out of his mind by the parties his wife forces him to attend and his pathetic job. He then falls in love with his children's babysitter and fantasizes about her almost constantly. These themes of boredom and frustration are expertly portrayed by Kevin Spacey.<br/><br/>Indeed, American Beauty is a very artistic sort of film (despite having been parodied in Not Another Teen Movie) and leaves you feeling understood and completed.

To top all this off, Carolyn is cheating on Lester. <br/><br/>I really felt moved by the end of the film. Among the first words we hear in the film are from Lester saying, ""In less than a year from now, I will be dead."" That is true, but all the events that lead up to his death and extremely compelling and when you realize he's about to die, you know that he's achieved what he's been looking for. And not only has he achieved it, but he's helped others come through their problems and his monologue is so true.

At times funny, it still maintains a dark humor, that can be taken lightly or dramatically.<br/><br/>Mena Suvari, while in the beginning, you may not see the attraction to why she was chosen for the role of the ""American Beauty"", halfway into the film, you really begin to see why she was picked for the part. She is outstanding, as is everyone, especially Chris Cooper, in his portrayal of a ex-military soldier, sure of keeping his eighteen year old son in line.<br/><br/>While the film tackles a lot of issues that some might find, offensive or grosse, I find the movie to always be genuinely entertaining and thoughtful. It's an interesting film that will always keep you waiting for the next scene, surprise and line.<br/><br/>Annette Benning, rightly nominated for her role as the wife of a man who's gone completely numb from living with her for two decades, is at her very best in this movie. She is so convincing that there are times when it's hard to remember it's only a film that we're viewing. However, this being said, that almost all of the actors in this piece were phenomenal, the one person I think is almost out of place was Thora Birtch. Her role as the daughter of Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning, isn't as convincing as some of the other characters, and quite frankly could have been played better by another actress.<br/><br/>Allison Janney was remarkable as the wife of Chris Cooper, and it always disappoints me that she has such a small role in the film. She usually is casted in comedies, and is a hilarious comedianne, however, in this piece she plays an almost mental case, hardly ever talking and when she does it's done brilliantly.<br/><br/>The direction is outstanding, and the writing very precise. The music is perfect for the film, especially at dark moments, when the music gets deeper and more threatening. Those are the best parts of the film.<br/><br/>The costumes and set design were right on, and very applicable to the film and what it required.<br/><br/>It's honestly quite rare that I find a film I have no complaints about, and this is one of them. This film is a definite 10/10 simply because it's perfect. There is nothing in this film that I would change. I would highly recommend it. Baring in mind that it does contain a lot of subject matter and nudity that may not be appropriate for all ages.<br/><br/>But, check it out.

","If someone would ask me to name a handful of the most important movies of the 90's, or of the cinema for the matter, 'American Beauty' would be on that list. <br/><br/>The movie basically is a transformation story of a man called Lester (Kevin Spacey), who wakes up in a revelation that he's been asleep during his life after seeing his daughters, Thora Birch, friend Angela (Mena Suvari) dancing during a recess of a basketball match. As it seems evident, that his daughter Jane and wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) both seem to think, that he's obsolete and useless, he begins to day dream of his Lolita crush and shape his future towards getting what he so desperately believes he is in need of. So he starts to puff some weed, that he buys from his new hero Ricky (Wes Bentley), and lift some weights to become the attraction he thinks Angela would be drawn to.<br/><br/>The movie is well written and directed. There is so much poetry in some of the scenes, that you could spend hours just to watch the things to flow by, while the soundtrack is bringing the most perfect moods for each scene laid before the viewers eyes.<br/><br/>I've seen the film may times and yet it still feels fresh each time I watch it.

","I heard about American Beauty after the Oscars fuss in which it did tremendously well and I wondered, ""What is it about this movie?"". Its director was British but it is rooted particularly in the American Consciousness of the now, this century. Kevin Spacey is sublime as Lester Burnham, the beleaguered, comatose American husband on the verge of a midlife crisis. His marriage is a mess, his wife is preoccupied with her career and 'stuff', his daughter is enduring typical teenage angst and insecurity and he is wondering why he is sleepwalking through life. Tired of doing this, Lester decides to blackmail his boss and quits his job with a massive payoff, fantasies about his daughter's blonde best friend, works out, smokes the dope bought from his new neighbour's overly sensitive son who films people dong strange stuff and gets a new job in a Burger bar to be deliberately difficult. All of this exasperates his wife, who after watching him 'masturbate' and getting a lecture on 'why' decides to learn to screw her rival and shoot guns. Meanwhile his daughter is now involved with his new neighbour's son who is having lots of problems with his controlling All American US Marine Corp father.<br/><br/>You just know this mixture is like gunpowder.

","The ironic thing about 'American Beauty' is that no matter how many times you see it, you still don't quite comprehend the massive beauty of the movie itself. However, throw in a couple of amazing actors, writer Alan Ball, director Sam Mendes, and mix it in with complete originality, and the result is an excruciatingly complex and deep movie.<br/><br/>The story starts off with Lester talking about your 'regular' 40-something year-old mid-life crisis life, and reminds the audience the he will be dead in less than a year. From the moment the narration from Kevin Spacey is initiated, we are juggled into a realistic world of self-pity, lust, betrayal, narcissism, and controversial subject matter. The following 100-something minutes leave us breathless as our imagination grabs hold of the tragedy that is life, and doesn't let go until we realize 'American Beauty' is nothing but a metaphor for the life that surrounds us.<br/><br/>The surreal juxtaposition of the characters foreshadows an ever-growing feud between families, friends and even colleagues. Carolyn (Bening) loathes the thought of being an average housewife, while their daughter Jane (Birch) accepts the idea of being 'ordinary' and moves on with life. Each character is flawed and never either overpowers or seems inferior to another character, which is so strongly a reflection of the real life. The rest of the cast is unique and quirky but just enough to show that not everyone is perfect. Angela - portrayed by the brilliant Mena Suvari - gives off the impression that she is loved and looked up at while never facing the reality that she pales in comparison to the beauty that is life.<br/><br/>The movie focuses more on Lester (Spacey) and how he comes to terms with his own identity, and lives life to the fullest. What he fails to realize is that nothing can be that easy, and no one stays young and has fun forever. The dialogue in the movie is perfect. It fits the realistic feel while inspiring the audience and constantly flowing the thoughts of the characters.<br/><br/>To be honest, 'American Beauty' charges us with such insight, such depth and such honesty that we just cannot ignore. The inspiring screenplay magnificently captures each and every element a good movie should have and goes beyond the expectations.<br/><br/>I have to say that 'American Beauty' is definitely genius. I saw it when it just came out and automatically I rented the VHS (I didn't have a DVD player then) and watched it over and over. Not only is it an original and thought-provoking drama, but you can watch it constantly without ever getting bored."

","Sometimes less is more, as is the case here: Mena Suvari was not a huge star at the time, nor does she have a huge part, but she probably provides the most memorable performance. Spacey is excellent as the put-upon father, stuck in a rut as well as a mid-life crisis. Birch doesn't quite hit the mark here for me - her character borders on obnoxious and I can't decide if it's meant to be. The incidental characters are all polished performances and the score is quite magical. Whether it deserved 5 Oscars is debatable, as there were some good movies around in 1999.<br/><br/>It certainly impresses as an original piece of art, and also manages to accurately portray the hypocrisy of small-town life as it probably is in any westernized country across the globe. The actors don't hold back and the result is a satisfying, professional and complete work, that deserves a special place in recent cinematic history."

","This is a great American comedy about dysfunction and how the lives of middle-class American families have gone completely down the tubes, and it's a classic. It was a great success and many people saw great things in it. It bridged the generation gap. It touched people in the same way that ""The Graduate"" did, but it's a more sustained piece of work than ""The Graduate"". People who saw this film thought they were seeing a masterpiece and it went on to win the Oscar as the year's Best Picture.<br/><br/>The film's big issue is repressed homosexuality and it's on this crux that 'the drama' is played out and people who think the film is a masterpiece channel all their energies into this crucial plot point. They overlook the fact that it's a comedy and a very funny one at that; (ok, so it ends with a murder and blood on the wall but comedies sometimes do). The writer, Alan Ball, constructs his characters, not from people we might actually know, but from the characters we see on TV shows. (The film works because it's like the best bits gathered from the best TV shows ever). After winning an Oscar for ""American Beauty"" Alan Ball went on to develop one of the best of all TV shows in ""Six Feet Under"", though the television show that most closely resembles ""American Beauty"" isn't ""Six Feet Under"" but ""Desperate Housewives"".<br/><br/>It's director, Sam Mendes, had never made a movie before and he brings an innocent enthusiasm to the proceedings, (and being British he isn't burdened by any preconceptions; he looks at things through fresh, untrained eyes). As the anti-hero embracing the counter-culture, Kevin Spacey is close to iconic and he won an Oscar for his performance. It isn't that good a performance, rather it's expert line-reading but it's enough. Annette Bening is terrific as his wife. The part isn't well written but Bening transmogrifies it into some kind of comic nirvana. This is really subtle comic playing; the creation of a character out of nothing. And the supporting performances are just about perfect; the always reliable Chris Cooper and Allison Janney as the next door neighbours and newcomers Wes Bentley, (the gorgeous, drug-dealing son from next door), Thora Birch, (the daughter), and best of all, Mena Suvari as the nymphet best friend whom Spacey lusts after. She's a fireball, sex-kitten and when she's on screen she burns it up.<br/><br/>When I first saw this film I thought it was a very, very clever cartoon. Time has been kind to it. It's still like a cartoon but then Leonardo Da Vinci did cartoons and this one cuts to the core."

","I would give it a 10 but I still think it should have been another actor to win best actor that year. Yes, Kevin Spacey did a brilliant job in this role. He always gives his best in any role. He lives to act in my opinion. Contrary to other people's opinions. He puts 100 percent in the film and he will go down as one of the great American actors in history. Well anyway, I still think and believe that another actor like Richard Farnsworth should have won for his role in Straight Story because it was his last great role and he has spent a lifetime in the movie industry but that's my only complaint. I do have another complaint and that's the gay couple that lived next door. They just seemed almost functional in my opinion in a neighborhood where straight families are generally dysfunctional in the first place. I don't believe there is anything functional about any family regarding their sexual orientation--straight or gay. Everybody's dysfunctional, it would have been nice to see some of it in the gay couple. They just seemed too happy if you know what I mean. Well anyway that's another little problem with the film but it's otherwise a great film overall. I think Annette Bening should have won Best Actress Oscar beating Hilary Swank who won for Boys' Don't Cry that year. Again she was beaten for her role in Being Julia. Kind or ironic? Annette is brilliant. Sam Mendes has a tough act to follow after winning his first Academy award for his first film. Anyway, I thought Mena Suvari and Thora Birch were pretty good in their roles. I didn't even recognize the great Allison Janney as the depressed wife next door. Maybe her son should give her his stuff to make her happy. She's almost zombie like. I love the scene at the drive-thru restaurant. That's American suburbia in my opinion. I loved Peter Gallagher in his small role. I did feel that the main characters did love each other despite their problems. It's heartbreaking at the end of the film. A great film like this makes you think about your life in suburbia or anywhere. Is anybody really happy? Why do we take on roles like working at jobs we hate and pretend to be happy? That's what American Beauty is really about, are we really happy in our lives? Maybe not as much as we could be. I think everybody can be a great actor or actress-pretending to be happy in an unhappy world called the living. Not to sound depressing but when I saw Carolyn trying to sell a house. The scene of her breaking down and crying was the heartache of life in general. It didn't matter if it was the city, suburbia or rural. Maybe it's a film about materialism, Even the rich aren't really happy, neither is the poor."

But the fact remains that you should find this film's tone cathartic - to watch every character living successful lives of quiet desperation.<br/><br/>Where is the redemption for the disparate spirits in this film?

It is a dark film, yet with much humour, largely because of Anette Bening's brilliant Oscar-nominated performance, counterpointed with Kevin Spacey's Oscar-winning performance.<br/><br/>The premise is simple: good American families and suburbs aren't what they seem-- although the film is intensely American, it raises issues relevant to other societies: and examines relationships with a scalpel! Lester Burham (played, brilliantly by Kevin Spacey) is facing a mid-life crisis. His daughter finds love, and his wife (n anal-retentive Realtor) needs to find meaning to her life.<br/><br/>Add in a functional gay couple, an affair, a repressive ex-marines family (equally well played by Alison Janney as the downtrodden, submissive wife, Chris Cooper - as a repressing and repressed ex-Colonel and Wes Bentley as his rebellious son), and the microscope begins to look like a kaleidoscope! Patterns emerge, themes repeat and a neighbourhood of ""ordinary people"" is dissected.<br/><br/>Relationships emerge and converge: the film is well-directed and beautifully scripted by Alan Ball (of Six Feet Under fame, written after this film.)

The plot examines the depth of people's hopes and fantasies whilst intertwining these revealing moments with their hatred for the superficial nature of their every day lives. To my mind though, it is the literal beauty of this movie which is breathtaking. The way each shot is framed is a wonder to behold and the use of colour in every scene provides a visual juxtaposition with the seemingly mundane lives of the characters. I simply haven't the words or the time to express how much this movie affected and moved me. If most people make movies, I feel Mendes created a work of art when he created American Beauty.

","'American beauty', a masterpiece of a movie, winner of five academy awards 1999, brilliant writing and fantastic directing. The nature of the human behavior with dreams and reality is very realistic and the acting is so precise that it seems very real.<br/><br/>'American Beauty' is about Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) who is at the break of a mid life crisis. He lives in the perfect town and has your average family but if you ask him it's all a fake. The characters in the neighborhood are very different, there is Lester Burnham the man going through a mid life crisis, Carolyn Burnham who is Lester Burham's wife but she acts very plastic and she try's to keep the family together but when she doesn't succeed she sleeps with another man, then there is Jane Burnham the troubled teenager who ends up falling in love with the boy next door. After the family we come to the family next door, first there is Ricky Fits the son who was once in a mental institution but now has an obsession with filming the Burnham family (they don't know that their being filmed), he is different from everyone else because he looks closer to life, then there is Ricky's dad Col. Frank Fits who is a Gulf War veteran, he is obsessed with strict army rules and hates gays and drugs. We then come to Angela Haves, she is someone who claims to always having sex with rich people, she is also depressed but she hides it, from the moment Lester Burnham sees her he falls in love with her, mainly because of her youth.<br/><br/>There is only one other time that I've said this but 'American Beauty' is more of a Hollywood work of art (the other time was with 'The Shawshank Redemption'), it has a beauty yet such a realistic nature to it which adds to the fantastic work of art. <br/><br/>Something that the audience may not have known was that when Lester became obsessed with Angela, he wasn't actually obsessed with Angela as such, Angela to him represented youth, he became obsessed with youth. That was also a very realistic aspect because it was a way to get through to you the obsession with youth that may occur to some people in their forty's. Carolyn Burnham is not suffering from a mid life crisis so she doesn't understand but she acts very cheerful and happy in front of guests but is really very depressed so instead of making out that she's loving Lester she decide's to have sex with a happier and richer man, which Lester doesn't care about, he just says that his marriage is for show.<br/><br/>'American Beauty' is a film of real beauty, the acting is fantastic from all of the actors and actress's, the directer has made a very fake happiness yet very realistic landscape ant atmosphere and the writer has written a script that is very well written and is very different from your usual script. The characters are very well created and very different to each other. 'American Beauty' is one of the best and most touching movies ever, if you haven't seen then it's a must watch.<br/><br/>Look closer"

","American Beauty. These words symbolize the movie. It is about an American who finds divine beauty in his life and the world.<br/><br/>The story starts off with Lester Birmingham narrating his pathetic life. The audience immediately fins out that he is a loser. (He even admits it.) Lester may cause the audience to feel embarrassed about watching it, during the first few minutes. He has to be one of the worst parents out there. He appears absolutely pathetic when he falls in love with his daughter's friend.<br/><br/>So, here we have a pathetic excuse for a father, who is in love with a girl at least 10 years younger than him. His life becomes even worse when he loses his job, and his wife pretty much leaves him. So, Lester kind of turns his life around when he is introduced to Ricky Fits. Ricky sells him drugs, and teaches him how to govern his own life.<br/><br/>The real drama starts when Lester's life affects everybody else. At this point, the film is no longer about Lester, but about the people in his life, and what is happening to them. Everybody becomes depressed, but they all find out how beautiful life can really be. This section of the film is probably the most dramatic, and the most moving.<br/><br/>The characters are realistic, (except for Ricky) and the film seems to be almost poetic. It truly brings out the human emotions, and shows the good and ugly side of human nature. It shows the struggles, battles and insecurity taking place in all of our hearts. <br/><br/>However, the film seems to be a bit too perverted for some. How many moments of nudity are there? More than enough. The message seems to be a bit unfitting for the film, too. Tragedy and beauty mix together, but not in a good way, during some scenes.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed American Beauty, but I thought it could have been better.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment."

""American Beauty"" received the Academy Award for Best Film of 1999, about which I have no argument.

He's silent, and seemingly videotapes everything and everyone (Cooper). It is often through his lens that we observe these lives.

","American Beauty portrays the suburban life of a man who looks back on his life and sees the problems within it. It is a story of him and the people who he interacts with, who eventually play a little part in his small life. The characterization is good and believable, thanks to some talented actors and actresses. It is also a very thoughtful film, examining beauty and perspective. (Different people have different ideas about beauty.) The film is full of twists and turns, and character development and emotion is one of the strongest points of this film. (A similar concept about people looking back on their lives is the popular Desperate Housewives series.) American Beauty is worth at least one watch.

","SPOILERS We all wish we could do a Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey). Every day, life is the same monotonous process. We get up, those who can get jobs go into work and do them (often with a dislike for it), and by and large the majority of the population is mostly miserable. Couples change as they grow old, and as an ever increasing divorce statistic shows, they start to hate each other. So, let's change our lives, Burnham did.<br/><br/>""American Beauty"" was a masterpiece put simply. Constantly packed full of glorious images and the notion that there is beauty everywhere, it gorges the eyes and it hits the heart. We laugh, we cry, we fall in love with the Burnham family (yes, even Annette Bening's bitchy wife) and in the end of the day, we sit there in awe at the jewel that we've just witnessed.<br/><br/>Lester Burnham (Spacey) is dead. We know this because he tells us so in the opening credits. Recounting the final year of his life, we learn about how life has gone wrong. A depressed and miserable loner, Burnham hates his job, he hates himself, and his rare joy is an occasional bout of masturbation in the shower. Yes, for Burnham life is awful. That is, until he falls in love. Encountering his daughter's friend Angela (Mena Suvari), Burnham is a man possessed. All of a sudden he's taking drugs, he's exercising constantly and he's blackmailing his boss. He radically alters his life, and for the first time in what feels like an eon, he is happy.<br/><br/>This film is, rather appropriately considering the name, a thing of pure beauty. Majestic in appearance, plot, acting, soundtrack, and just about everything, it is just out of this world.<br/><br/>Led from the front by the enigmatic Spacey, arguably one of the finest actors of his generation, the film never fails to leave you breathless with joy.<br/><br/>Well, saying that, it does leave you questioning your own existence. The film is a joy because it makes you want to change your own life. Few films in the modern era really get under the skin, but ""American Beauty"" does it without looking like it's trying. It drags its message into your heart, and as Burnham's life is played out before your eyes, you find yourself driven to examine the irrelevance of your own existence. It's depressing stuff, but in a good way.<br/><br/>How can the film leave you joyous and miserable I hear you ask? It isn't that confusing truthfully. Examining your own life can be one of the most depressing and most important things you will ever do, but when a film has such a beautiful and honest approach to the subject, you can feel a content sense of happiness at your own misery. Few films can really disorientate like this, and ""American Beauty"" does it wonderfully.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful film for multiple reasons. Amazing in just about every detail, it is near to perfect. At the same time, it engulfs you. It leaves you passionate about your own life, and it inspires you to change it. Now that can't be a bad thing."

If you look at all the other Oscar winners (Best picture), you will notice that they are either HORRIBLY BORING, SUGARY AND MELODRAMATIC, like ""The English patient""; or ""PSYCHOLOGICAL"" (pseudo-psychological rather), like the ""Silence of the lambs""; or IRRITATINGLY ""MAINSTREAM"", like ""The lord of the rings""; or RELYING ON PATRIOTISM, like ""Forrest Gump"" (which is a good movie and is in TOP 100 of my 400 chosen films class, but yes: it relies on patriotism and historic melancholia); or being about something ANCIENT, HEROIC AND HISTORICAL, which all the people are interested in - like ""Gladiator"" and ""Brave Heart""; or created DUE TO HISTORIC NECESSITY and boosted by guilty conscience, like ""The Schindler's list"". So, ""American Beauty"" is unique, as to my disbelief something messed in the heads of the Academy members and it has managed to win these shiny, unapproachable, pretentious, ""politically correct"" Oscars, 5 of 8, which are always given to the mentioned above. There is only one more exception about the right film sweeping the Oscars, but it doesn't count, as it was the second greatest movie of all times and it is so great, that even its ""political"" neutrality, which helped it a lot to win 11 of its 14 Oscar nominations, doesn't spoil it. Ah, yes - there is one more - from the 80s: the third greatest film - but it had a great plot and a great Italian director.<br/><br/>If you look closely, you will see how ""American Beauty"" is unique. There are simply NOT ANY OTHERS LIKE IT. Not even one. Its derivate, ""Pay it forward"", would be one of the greatest films, if ""American Beauty"" didn't exist, but in its presence it looks like a weakened and diluted copy.<br/><br/>Despite the Oscar awards and despite the overwhelming number of 10-star comments on the IMDb site, this film is still misunderstood by many. There are brainless, fanatical, religiously fervent, ""moralistic"" people (who actually don't have the slightest idea what moral is), who say it is sick and spoiling; and there are others - incredibly misguided - who think it is negative, black, sad and finishes tragically, without perspective, and without giving an answer, or a hope about the problems depicted. For the first ones there is no hope: as they have done it thousands of times through the history, they will burn at the stake everything beautiful and wonderful, which doesn't match their horrific, dark, morbid perception of reality. And in relation to the misled: these people could not be farther from the truth. Just turn on 180 degrees the second sentence of this paragraph, and you will get exactly what ""American Beauty"" is.<br/><br/>I tell you: this man was REBORN. And he died happy, he died with a full heart, full of life - not as a pitiful pensioner pissing in his pants, while contemplating the history of his dried, miserable existence. And more: he died, knowing how much beauty there is in the world - almost failing to bear it, only remembering to let it flow through him like rain, in order to be able to bear it, to feel it, without bursting.<br/><br/>SPOILERS COMING<br/><br/>When he was filming her face, not the other girl; when she showed her breast through the window to him after she slapped her; when they were watching the flying bag; when it turned out that she's still a virgin, and then - when he left her; and when she said: ""I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING WORSE IN THIS WORLD THAN TO BE ORDINARY""; when she returned and cried for him, and hugged his clothes, dropping the gun she was intended to use against him; when he remembered the great moments of his life - good god, it was so beautiful, I almost couldn't bear it...<br/><br/>But I managed to bear it, and I'm happy now. And tranquil about anything bad that can happen to me - I will neutralize it with Beauty. With ""American Beauty""."

This movie shows that no matter how uniform or normal a person or place might seem, there are still little secrets, there are still those who are lost and confused. This movie, at least to me, almost promotes a way of life. It is the story of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) and his what some would call mid-life crisis but it is more of a journey. It is about him forgetting all of the things that most people find important like a sofa or a stupid job and living his life to the fullest. It also is about his whole family just finding what truly makes them happy, no matter what anyone else says or does, they do what makes them happy which in turn makes them happy and slowly all of the things that used to matter before like reputation and conformity disappear. this movie is an exploration of the human soul and the human need for happiness. There are strong performances all around which earned Kevin Soacey an academy award and the movie the best picture award. the most disappointing part was though, that Annette benning did not win the award, her performance was absolutely amazing.

"matthew-armstrong-2","5","0","1","9 May 2005"," Shrill, self-indulgent pabulum
","One of the most overly celebrated films in cinema history, American Beauty is a ridiculous piece of baby boomer self-indulgence.<br/><br/>The film is nearly devoid of inspiration, and what inspiration there is to be found is largely juvenile. Annette Bening and Chris Cooper (talented actors, both) give perhaps the worst performances of their characters. Their negative/villainous characters lack any sort of depth or fullness. They exist merely as tackling dummies for the heavy-handed messages of the film.<br/><br/>And what juvenile messages they are! Anyone who was surprised or moved by the ridiculous scene in which Bening refuses to make love to Spacey (lest they spill wine on their couch) is abandoning any sort of intelligent analysis. This sort of quasi-symbolic debate is what passes for a social statement in AB.<br/><br/>American Beauty is pornography for the upper-middle-class baby boomer. You can practically feel the desperation of the filmmakers to pleasure their audience with scenes of Spacey telling off his boss, returning to the passions of his youth etc. And the public fell for it, hook, line and sinker. Heavy-handed symbolism (Wow, rose petals! Gee, the color red sure shows up a lot! Wonder what that could mean?) and trite dialogue were easily ignored.<br/><br/>From a technical perspective, the film is highly competent, and as a result it will bore few. But it's essentially trash, and unimaginative trash at that."
"MatBrewster","7","0","1","3 May 2005"," Rather Silly, But Quite Enjoyable
","The first time I saw American Beauty it was the last in three consecutive weekend movie run. The other two films were Fight Club and Bringing Out the Dead. All three films are about men trying to come to terms to what it means to be a man in America in this day and age. Fight Club finds meaning in deconstructing everything down to base needs, feeling through pain. Bringing Out the Dead gives meaning to its character through drug use, but is was in American Beauty that I found some sense of hope.<br/><br/>In the film, Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) plays a middle aged, middle class suburbanite, with seemingly everything he could desire. He has a good, well paying job; a beautiful wife (Annette Bening); a large luxurious house; and a lovely daughter (Thora Birch). Yet, with all of this he is not happy. In fact, all of these things are not quite what they seem. His employer is facing cut backs, and he may soon lose his job. He marriage is in shambles, and his daughter openly hates him. Early, we see him masturbating in the shower, in narration; he states this is the highpoint of his day. All is not well in the house of Burnham.<br/><br/>All of this changes when Lester meets Angela (Mena Suvari), his daughter, Jane's gorgeous, cheerleader friend. On first seeing Angela during a cheer routine, Lester feel a special, lustful connection. Later that night, Lester overhears Angela playfully tell Jane that if he would only work out, he would be sexy. His lust over this teenage vixen becomes the catalyst for the film and Lester's very life.<br/><br/>Soon after Lester quits his job, in fact he bilks the company for a year's salary by threatening to disclose scandalous information that he has become privy to. He begins smoking pot, buys a hot rod.. He plays with remote control cars, takes a job at a fast food joint, and of course does start working out. In every way he reverts back to his teenage years. Even the soundtrack begins blaring out classic rock tunes from the 1970's. Finally after years, decades even, of feeling low, miserable, not alive, he feels great.<br/><br/>This reversion back to his glory days is only the beginning. It is a reversion back to the days when he had fun, when he felt alive. But he is not a man who will stop there. This is just a beginning point to a life long conversion of living a full life, as opposed to a life full of the right things, but that is ultimately empty. Or it would be if he was not shortly dead (this is not nearly the spoiler you might think it is, for Lester announced his death within the first minutes of the film.) Towards the end of the film we can see that Lester is already outgrowing his childish behavior. When he yells at his daughter, he immediately feels the sting of regret. When given the chance to indulge in his lusts, he backs away, understanding that it is not right. Just as the music changed to classic rock with the first change, here it has changed again, turning into the same classic rock being covered by newer, contemporary artists.<br/><br/>Many will probably say that using the lust for a teen, and illicit drug us as a catalyst for change, is not a change for the better. I can already hear my mother scolding me for having seen the movie, much less reviewed it from 2,000 miles away in Oklahoma. Yet, here it works, and works well. I don't believe the film is saying that these things should be the means to a change, these things only served as means for this character to break free from the rut that had become his life. There is a telling scene where Lester and his wife are overcome with sexual desire. As he dips his wife to kiss her, she stops the embrace because he is near to spilling his glass of wine on an expensive couch. An argument ensues with Lester proclaiming that ""it's just a couch,"" while his wife is horrified at the thought of ruining said couch. There lies one of the central themes of the film. That these characters are so wrapped up in the material that they lose sight of the better pleasure of life, including love making.<br/><br/>It is not a perfect film. The Burnham's neighbor, Col. Fritts (Chris Cooper) seems a caricatured archetype. His plays a hateful, homophobe who really carries deep rooted homosexual tendencies is too outlandish to be considered real. Though it must be said the part is played marvelously by Chris Cooper. Jane's speech about being a freak too, may move the young kids who consider themselves the nonconformist, shy-type, but it is too after-school special for my tastes.<br/><br/>I've left out some of the best scenes and an important character, Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley). He plays the drug dealing son of Col. Fritts, who likes to record everything on his video camera. There is a moving scene in which he and Jane watch an old tape of his of a plastic bag floating through the air. It is a moving, poetic scene that conjures up thought of the futility of life and its very beauty. It is that type of movie. It creates beautiful, moving, simple scenes that bring a sense of hope to life, while at the same time, showing the ultimate horror of living it."

","Have seen the movie for the third time and once again enjoyed it immensely. As in all worth while classics, the theme is about our everyday lives and our desperate attempts at finding a deeper meaning. Kevin Spacey, who is once again superb,has reached a point in his existence where he suddenly realizes what life is, has been and what the future has to offer:the only possible answer is: death. This cruel insight (which hits us all like lightning one day or another)is so overwhelming that he sets off on an ultimate search for fulfilment, hoping to find it in a glorification of earthly love. His wife ( an excellent Annette Benning)who is also a victim of the sense of doom does exactly the same although her desperate attempts at finding ""love and understanding"" are more down to earth and do not carry the inherent dramatic message of disaster which Spacey irradiates from the opening scenes on.In the background are the young ones who also have to cope with their search for meaning:their doubts and feelings of insecurity are delicately portrayed by means of exquisite dialog and excellent camera work. Are their ways of escaping from the boredom and predictability of life in general? The inherent message of the movie is ""yes"" but .. the price we pay may be much higher than we initially believed.Another important aspect of American Beauty is that it illustrates how difficult it is to communicate in present-day society: we are all so preoccupied with appearances and how others see us that we refrain from expressing our true selves or feelings of doubt and insecurity.The weak part of this movie is the ending: both the husband and wife reach a form of catharsis as a result of their sudden insight into what they have lost by trying to take on a new identity. Admittedly,too far-fetched and gratuitously moralizing. A special mention for Thomas Newman: ""Dead Already"" & ""Any Other Name"" are beautiful musical themes."

This tremendous piece of cinematic work drives home the truth: all of us desperately wish for our youth and all its irresponsibility and vibrancy to return to us, but the fact is its gone forever, and our lives will never be as satisfying as it was back then.<br/><br/>American Beauty is the symbolic dream of all adults everywhere in the world to somehow recapture any and all aspects of their youth. In fact, many are desperate for exactly that. So much so that while we deny it to ourselves, we fantasize every day and night about the reality that we all would in fact do ANYTHING to return to our youth and stay there forever. Only after we age and become jaded to the world do we lose the pure joy that comes with being alive as we realize that existence revolves around trade-offs and compromise.<br/><br/>The character of Lester Burnham is classically created as we all see ourselves: initially weak, and only strong when independent, and it is that independence which ultimately destroys him. Perhaps moreso than any character in film in the last 10 years, Lester encapsulates the brutal truth that if one chooses to rebel against the conformity of the American Dream, one risks an enormous amount, even their own death. American Beauty is a fantastic voyage of the mind and soul through the eyes of quiet desperation, as one by one we all acquiesce to the reality that life ultimately grinds us all under its plow."

The trials and the tribulations faced by a middle aged man whose personal as well as professional life is in shambles. Brilliant portrayal here by Spacey, the best role of his career even better than the Usual Suspects. All round performances by Annette Benning, Mena Suvari, Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper and Thora Birch definitely boost the movie. Here I mention almost the entire cast because they all do their roles perfectly. <br/><br/>My favorite scene was the plastic bag swirling in the wind thing the way it is described is really spellbinding. The beauty of the scene is brilliantly captured by the camcorder. <br/><br/>Benning as the troubled, I-want-it-all wife is brilliant. The way she portrays her sadness by crying shows the fact that she has been harassed to the extreme by Lesters attitude and tries her best to be independent but just cannot. Her having an affair is but a natural extension.<br/><br/>Chris Cooper is great as the gay hating, suspicious dad. A little more could have been mentioned about his past and his wife one feels.<br/><br/>MILD SPOILER *** Mena Suvari as the bitch that everyone just loves fits her character to a T. Here Mendes makes a turnaround in the end ( probably taking some personal dig) by saying she is still a virgin quite contrary to her characters actions and behaviour.<br/><br/>Birch and Bentley make a good pair and come up with good performances to match the theme of the movie. Their scenes together carries important details with respect to human frustration and irritation.<br/><br/>Thats about it, watch Beauty if you want to introspect, take a check on your life or just want 2 hours of good movie watching.<br/><br/>P.S - A memorable dialogue - When asked if he wants to exercise to become thin or fitter or build muscles, Lester replies "" WELL I JUST WANT TO LOOK GOOD NAKED"" Damn if that isn't the truth then what is ????"

","A Suburban Joe enters a mid-life crisis which involves quitting his well-paid job and starting an affair with a teenage girl.<br/><br/>We all know that real tragedy is usually some medieval king deciding if he should wage war or make peace on his neighbour. A million miles away from the safe American suburbs where nothing actually happens - or does it?<br/><br/>While the acting here is first class and the story is a bit witty and a bit kinky, I think people are going a bit overboard about it. Best Picture Oscar? Well that shocked me more than the film itself!<br/><br/>Mid life crisis is one thing, but Spacey takes it to a Spinal Tap like ""11"" and then some. This should be a slapstick comedy really, but it takes a dark turning for reasons that I don't fully understand. Maybe this is what makes it such a critical winner - give 'em enough murk and they can see anything. People that are well fed, safe and healthy can be tragedies too?<br/><br/>I almost want to crib other people's reviews on this one. I enjoyed it, sure, but where is the depth? What are people really enjoying here? What are the key points being made?<br/><br/>Is it - as I suspect - people having safe, but boring, lives and looking on this movie as what would happen if they cut lose and went a little crazy themselves. But are very unlikely to do so. Does this film contain some kind of hidden suburban fantasy that I don't share?<br/><br/>Is this film anti-monogamy? Or am I seeing things in the shadows and mist? Being single I have often viewed marriage as being a little boring - and the thought of a sexless marriage sends shivers down my spine. A personal view only, for all you married folk!<br/><br/>Yes - liked it, but its classic status has to be explained to me more clearly. This is an urban black comedy and a bit different from the norm, but that alone doesn't make it all that special."

","Some film just have an atmosphere that make you constantly question yourself, your moral, that kind of thing. This did that very well through a very intense and deep storyline without being too complicated to make it's several points. The plot was anything but predictable and even when I thought I knew what was going on it turned out I was way off track, I'm sure I fell for the intentionally misleading trap that were set, which is proof of very skilled writing. The soundtrack was very appropriate; I really like it when films use mostly real songs rather than music composed specifically for the film: it seemed to apply better because you know the songs weren't written for what we know the characters are feeling and thinking but it still lines up perfectly. The acting was great by all the main characters. I particularly liked Chris Cooper's character - the slightly messed up marine.<br/><br/>It was also well shot with an interesting variety of shots & angles. The shots from Ricky's camcorder were a great way to show things about his character by what he pointed his camera at, whilst being an interesting perspective for the audience to see the characters. It was also evident that great thought was given to lighting in most scenes. Great thought was given to everything and nothing was left to chance, which it why this film won so many awards. At first I thought this may have been what you'd call a 'chick flick' by the poster and reading that it was about relationships and that kind of thing. I'm so glad I gave it a try because it's definitely not all these stereotypical and clichÃ©d things. I'm also glad I saw it because now I get one of the jokes in Not Another Teen Movie."

I always though she was just some babe that had something to do with Warren Beatty. Wow!: that scene where she convulses into tears after the open house. Is that what they call visceral acting? I've seen American Beauty 4 or 5 times, & each time that scene sends chills up my spine. Her whole quirky, esteem less, desperate-for-attention persona places her on par with Streep et al.<br/><br/>American Beauty is a fascinating example of the notion of imagination forcing a disconnection with consciousness. Spacey's fantasies about the teenager & the Marine neighbor: more elements of horror than titillation. If you like something beyond being passively entertained, see American Beauty.

","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""American Beauty"" is one of those rare films which succeeds marvelously both in its entertainment and cinematic values, in delivering on a variety of latitudes. It offers a fascinating, simple tale, of a frustrated, ordinary suburbanite finally deciding to reverse the injustices and slums of his life in being everything he has always desired to be. This epiphany comes in the midst of a mid-life crisis, as he becomes estranged from his family, leery of his career and his recent state of life, where ""the highlight of (his) day is in the shower"". Couple this with his sudden fascination with his daughter's beautiful friend, and you have one entertaining, funny, and hearty tale reflecting the American way of life. In the process of entertaining us with whimsical, hilarious, and valuable lines and the actors delivering brilliant, unforgettable performances, we examine some crucial problems in society (e.g. homophobia, drug addiction, obsession with appearance, etc.), in the life of the Burnham family and their new neighbors. This is a funny, genial, and satiric classic of the contemporary American conscience, and the willpower deep within ourselves to correct our seemingly miserable lives. Lester Burnham provides many of us a heroic example of how we can reject everything which has consumed us in our misery, and begin recreation, in quitting our petty jobs, announcing our voice at the dinner table, and perhaps getting in shape to be as impressive as we can be. We learn about the beauty of life not belying in a materialistic, operational society, but rather, in the brilliant blowing of the wind, causing such an insignificant object as a plastic bag to appear marvelous as it dances in the air. This is a film that reminds us that it is never too late to recognize the true beauties of life, to improve upon our own lives, and to strive towards achieving those unreachable subjects of our dreams. This is a cinematic masterpiece, featuring not only an indelible, valuable story, but brilliant, passionate direction, wonderful, biting performances, engaging, unforgettable dialogue, and rich, poignant music. ""American Beauty"" will definitely be remembered and treasured as one of the most important and insightful films in cinematic history, a beautiful gem of a movie. **** out of ****"

","I have seen this movie at least 7 times and each time I get more out of it. For me, this is the one of the signs of a great movie. Another sign of a great movie is where the viewer can relate emotionally with several of the characters; which is rare. In a good movie one can relate to at least one character but in American Beauty, one can relate to several characters at once. <br/><br/>We have all had these primal feelings of desire, loosing ourselves in material ""needs"", posing for the neighbors and those around us. This Movie strips those all away and gets down into the trenches of the basic human being. Humor and irony perfectly combined into a movie that is so well done that you can watch it and completely miss out on everything that is important.<br/><br/>Lester (Spacey) always being driven (literally and figuratively) around by his wife is not only a metaphor for how this world is run by women and their desires and how men get caught up in a world of trying to please them and become pus_y whipped in the process. Women don't respect a man who isn't ""a man"" yet they work feverishly on molding them into something they don't respect. <br/><br/>Carolyn (Bening) is so wrapped up in impressing people she doesn't know or care about, that she completely forgot what it is to live a fulfilled life. She has already ""whipped"" Lester years ago and there is nothing more that is fun for her to do. <br/><br/>Don't bother to see this movie if you only have time to see it once. Watch it without distractions. Let it digest for an hour to a day and watch it again. Great movies grow and blossom just like the American Beauty Rose.<br/><br/>Take this movie and let it inspire you to become more than you are but what you could be if you give up the nonsensical things you think are important. <br/><br/>In the end we all die alone and nobody cares if you were ""perfect"" but they will remark on if you lived your life to the fullest and this is what should be most important to you also. I hope this movie is the starting place for many people to begin living and respecting themselves as human beings."

I really think that everyone should watch this movie and learn to understand the different things that make people tick. The ending is slightly confusing to those that have not been paying attention to the whole film. I believe that in the end, the father, played by Kevin Spacey, actually kills himself because he had done everything that he had hoped to do in his life. If you had not been paying attention, you may think that the wife or the neighbor killed him. I think that both the wife and the neighbor walked in at the wrong time.

I hadn't heard of Jake Gyllenhaal and I normally don't go for movies without at least 1 familiar face. <br/><br/>But I felt the way I did for Donnie Darko similarly for Jane Burnham and Ricky Fits(Thora Birch and Wes Bently) because I know little about the actors. What I have come to realize is that if you don't know the actor/actress then you don't know the character. For example if you are watching a Schwarzenegger movie you know he will grab someone and stick him on a spike at some stage. As for Jane and Ricky, you have no idea what they're going to do. A drama like this needs just that and Birch and Bently commanded this role with tremendous authority. Adding to this we have the ever-reliable presence of Kevin Spacey, playing Jane's mixed up middle-aged father Lester. <br/><br/>I can hardly describe the content of 'American Beauty' because I wouldn't know where to begin.

"TOMASBBloodhound","9","0","1","8 August 2004"," We never got to see Lester drive his Firebird!
","If there is one truth to this outstanding film it's this: Suburban life will absolutely suck the life out of a man. I think there are Lester Burnhams out there all over the country waiting to explode. <br/><br/>Kevin Spacey gives a truly astounding performance as Lester Burnham. He's a middle-aged man who hates his very existence. His job sucks, his family takes him for granted, and the only thing he has to look forward to each day is masturbating in the shower, or occasionally in the bathroom at work. Lester is truly having a mid-life crisis. But rather than break down in despair or visit a shrink, he just rolls with it. He quits his job, blackmails his company for another year's salary, trades in his little Toyota for a vintage Firebird, starts smoking dope, and begins to lust after his daughter's best friend. All of this to the horror of his wife who then begins to cheat on him. Watching Kevin Spacey play Lester is truly amazing. Even though this behavior in real life could really have a destructive effect on his family, you can't help but root for the guy.<br/><br/>
The other actors in this film are great too, but make no mistake, Kevin Spacey is what makes this film great. <br/><br/>Annette Bening is a little over-the-top in her portrayal of Lester's career-obsessed wife. She comes off completely fake and impersonal, as intended. The scene where she slaps herself for crying after failing to sell a house was perhaps a bit too much. But make no mistake about it; there are plenty of people like this in the world and they make me want to strangle them. <br/><br/>The three teenage characters are each made memorable by the terrific young performers playing them. This film is not afraid to take chances with these young people and that's a major reason this film works so well.<br/><br/>A major blemish this film suffers from is Chris Cooper's Marine Col. character. I don't know where to begin as far a criticizing this paper scarecrow they invented here. This Col. Fitts is a conglomerate of practically every stereotype you could think of. He's an abusive father, a bad husband, a Nazi memorabilia collector, a homophobe, and he's GAY all at once! And Hollywood takes its obligatory shot at the US military by making him a Marine on top of everything else. Cooper is a fine actor, and he does what he can with his character. I think the film would have been better served if they'd have taken Col. Fitts back to the drawing board and dropped some of his baggage, however. How about just making him an abusive father who hates gays? Wouldn't that have been enough? <br/><br/>Overall, this film works so well because it is unflinchingly honest. The drug use, the plastic career-minded saps, the teenage angst, the sexual frustration. These things are rampant out there. But at the same time the world is such a very beautiful place and we hardly even seem to notice it. This film should be required viewing for all middle-aged married types, unhappy teens, suburban folks... just about all of us.<br/><br/>
The film isn't perfect, but how many are? This isn't a film that you will likely forget about the moment you've dropped it off back at your rental place of choice. You might in fact feel compelled to own a copy of it.<br/><br/>
To all the potential Lesters of the world: Wake up! Life is passing you by!<br/><br/>
I'll give it 9 of 10 stars<br/><br/>So sayeth the Hound."

","The director of ""American Beauty"" has produced a scathing critique of alienation-filled societies: those that deify definitions of ""success"" so as to better ensure conformity, and their almost inevitable byproducts in despair and emptiness. The portrait of an American middle-class family allows the audience to see many of the most intimate human relations as diseased from the inside, though ""beautiful"" on the exterior; perfect for consumption, though dehumanized and ultimately hollow.<br/><br/>This film's depiction of alienation and fear recalls another by Gary Walkow (from 1995), entitled ""Notes from Underground"". This film is based on the Dostoevsky novel, though updated to fit late 20th century Los Angeles, bringing the very same themes and conflicts as existed in Dostoevsky's day to postmodern consciousness. This film is remarkably brilliant; Walkow's Underground Man (acted beautifully by Henry Czerny) reminds one of Lester Burnham in his bitter (and unsuccessful)rebellion from expectations and norms, and his eventual realization of the futility of such an escapade. The Underground Man's perception of others, at once spiteful and envious, taints his self-perception. Whereas Burnham comes to the somewhat ""Dostoevsky-esque"" conclusion that the dehumanization required to rebel from imposed constructs, itself, indicates failure. The Underground Man, likewise, is aware of this, though convinced of his inability to change. The final scene in ""American Beauty"" is, perhaps, a response.<br/><br/>Both films are brilliant, and deserving of 10 stars each."
"AurumStarFinder","10","0","1","15 July 2004"," Truly extraordinary
","If you haven't seen this film then you will never understand the middle class. Coming from a middle class background, I was astonished by how real this film felt. This film is actually quite shocking in the way it depicts life in the American suburbia.<br/><br/>I'll start with Lester. I don't know much about guys his age (which is probably a good thing) but I've got to admit that he does seem to be very ordinary. Bored, sedated and unsure of where he stands anymore in life, he sets out to do what my philosophy teacher is always trying to tell us: live life to the max. Kevin Spacey is a complete success as Lester Burnham and I hope to see more good turns from him in the future.<br/><br/>Caroline is just damn scary. Scary because she is completely out of touch with the real world. Scary because of her over the top perfectionism. Scary because she believes that she is not blind. Such people are best avoided or you will end up with a lot of trouble and a lot of pain. After seeing American Beauty I was actually proud that my parents are nothing like this. They're fussy, but at least they've got their eyes open most of the time, and therefore fussy about healthy things.<br/><br/>As for Jane, Ricky and Angela, this is the first time I've seen good acting from teenagers. Usually I'm never impressed by actors who are close to my age, mainly because they seem to either try too hard or they don't make any effort at all. Here though, I'm actually drawn in by them. I hated Caroline, which is why it makes me laugh to hear that Angela doesn't think much of her either because she's a ""phoney"". I don't hate Angela too, I just feel sorry for her narrow mindedness and lack of ambition. As for Jane, as normal as she may seem, there's a hidden side of her that seems to be unexpressed. She's not a freak, as she labels herself, she's just different from Angela. Good for her. And there's Ricky, who films all the incredible moments that life throws at us, trying to find the benevolent force that he saw in a bag dancing with golden leaves, learning to see all the beauty that most of us will never notice.<br/><br/>There's an interesting thing about all these characters. Lester loves his daughter and tries to look out for her when he can. And yet he buys weed off her boyfriend. Caroline tries to create her image of success even though she doesn't have any success at home or at her job and is dependent on her affair with someone who does have success for any fun out of life. Jane tries to appear normal, by being a cheerleader, hanging around with Angela, even her non-striking appearances. But it doesn't suit her. Ricky is a very strange person who films inanimate objects, but the things he sees most clearly are human beings. And Angela, no matter how much she says that there's nothing worse about being ordinary, is being completely self-contradictory and she is probably the most ugly person I've ever laid eyes on who was meant to be beautiful. <br/><br/>So I'm not too sure who the American Beauty is, if it even exists. Or even if there is such a thing as beauty. Hmm..."

","Movies make me cry quite often, especially when the main character dies. But, I didn't think I would cry after seeing this. At the beginning of the movie, I didn't like any of the characters. They were all so messed up, all so strange...I couldn't really connect with any of them. Lester (whose name must have some meaning..though I'm not sure what) is just a pervy-middle-aged man, and his wife is a cheating perfectionist...but their daughter seems relatively normal. And his next door neighbors are really creepy. But, in the end..it all makes sense! I JUST turned 17, and suddenly I feel much younger. And even though I'm young and haven't experienced much at all, I somehow have new hope and I feel bad for not appreciating life as I should. This movie has so much power. It really makes you...think...think about who you are. I cried when Lester died...after all those years of hating life, he finally loves it, and then he's dead.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed reading some of these comments. Some of them made me realize parts that I didn't understand, and other comments confused me. Why would people hate this masterpiece? It really hurts me when people call this movie ""shallow"" and ""over-rated."" Sure, Titanic SUCKED, but not all things that win Oscars suck, for God's sake! This movie was pure art and SO deep, something that many movies try to do and fail miserably. So why do people hate this movie? How can they not be touched by it? (just another mystery of life I guess) It's...genius, it really is. I can't even describe it."

","This film falls back on some of the oldest philosophy know to man. Socrates through Plato was able to get across many ideas but none more important than 'know thy self'. Kevin Spacey seems to hate his life and has let his family break down. He no longer has a reason to live until he meets his daughter's friend. This burst of life leads to his understanding of why he has become the person he is and how he regrets getting so far away from the people who loved him the most. In the end I think he realized his wrongs and actually begins to feel good about who he is and his role as a father. This film is an excellent example of how the horrors of suburbia can take over one's life and possibly end it."

","Usually, at the Oscars, you get the same old story - the films that are up for about five million awards are either war films or those zillion dollar movies like Titanic. I can always predict which film is going to win in and usually it makes me sick with the predictability. So how happy was I, that controversial, slightly bizarre but most importantly honest American Beauty had more than one nomination? <br/><br/>It's hard to say what exactly made me love this film, because there are so many elemants that impressed me. The acting for one. In fact, there wasn't really a bad performence and Kevin Spacey was perfect for the deadpan Lester. And thumbs up to Mena Suvari for her little tart cheerleader role - she was better than I thought she'd be.<br/><br/>Then there's the direction. All I have to say is Sam Mendes is very, very good. The image of the pristine white picket fence of a suburban town, Suvari lying naked in rose petals (how many times have people spoofed that now?) and the plastic bag floating serenely...it's all done with skill and elegance. Plus, he shows versatility, as his direction was quite different in Road to Perdition.<br/><br/>And let's not forget the score. Thomas Newman is my personal favourite and American Beauty is one of his best works. Again, he's influencing all those pathetic copycats, which just goes to show you...<br/><br/>But is it the message and openess of this movie that caught a lump in my throat towards the end? This is a simple tale about life - that we screw up, can never feel alive until we've died and that if we look closer, there's more beauty than we could imagine. And God forbid that middle-aged men are allowed to fantasise about teenage girls if they're bored with their marriage. That's life...you wouldn't get that message in Titanic."

","The clock is ticking on the life of hapless advertising journalist Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) as events in his screwed-up upper-middle-class neighborhood conspire to deprive him of his wife, his daughter, his job, and ultimately his life. Yet such is his situation that he finds peace and even humor in his predicament, and so will many a viewer in what is one of the 1990s' greatest films.<br/><br/>""American Beauty"" is one of those rare films where everything works. The acting, especially Spacey but also Annette Bening, Mena Suvari, and Peter Gallagher, all perform incredible balancing acts between drama and comedy while keeping their feet planted in a sense of reality. Sam Mendes' direction manages to find new visual ideas at every steps, compelling ones that lift our appreciation of the story; while Alan Ball's arresting script sets a fast pace that never lets up even as it pauses to ""look closer"" into the minds of its characters. Set direction, camera-work (by the late, great Conrad Hall), editing on a mission from God, a terrific vintage score, this is one film that never feels tired.<br/><br/>Definitely a surreal film, with its dream sequences and outrageous moments of character and action, ""American Beauty"" still feels completely representative of its time and place, Clinton-era blue-state America. Carolyn lives the life of a Martha-Stewart wannabe, trapped in a myth of human perfection, while Lester is a dehumanized corporate drone, living a life of profitability but zero richness. The dialogue is brilliant, not only because it averages one quotable line every minute but because it is grounded in the kind of casual conversation we hear around us every day.<br/><br/>It's also a very bold film, from its opening montage of Lester's morning ritual to its proposition that the one healthy protagonist in the whole film is a drug-dealing former mental patient. Spacey's lust for teenage Angela Hayes (Suvari) is presented in such a way to not only invite sympathy but even a sense of triumph when he seems about to achieve his dream. (By the way, I'm convinced people miss a comic highlight by focusing on Suvari's exquisite body and missing her eyes, which flash and roll at all the right moments like a nymphoid Carol Burnett channeling Joan Crawford.)<br/><br/>I don't like everything about this movie. The reveal of Col. Fits' big secret is too pat and typically knee-jerk Hollywood, and Lester's handling of his job situation feels excessive even within the rubbery confines of this film. But these are creative disagreements that further one's thinking about the movie, and appreciating it more. You can find yourself at odds with ""American Beauty"" in its philosophy, and its conclusions about the state of our society, but still relish its vibrancy and conviction of purpose.<br/><br/>Finally, there's a nice metaphysical construct to this movie, a post-Christian transcendentalism that may be as empty as a doughnut hole but offers some interesting food for thought about the unexamined life. You may not think a bag fluttering in a breeze represents true beauty, but you can enjoy how it calls into question our materialistic, self-centered way of life. It works in large part because it's never pressed too hard, never connected to the story points in a concrete way, but it works.<br/><br/>I agree with other posters here who say ""American Beauty"" is one Oscar winner for Best Picture that only gains stature with the passing years. Everyone should see it once. Most of those that do will want to see it again."

","The movie 'American Beauty' really touched me in a deep way because of the truth it tells. The movie deals with many different issues in society and family life and confronts the spectator with problems most people usually do not want to take a closer look at. For example, how 'perfect' families are actually only nice, loving and successful on the outside but sad, cold and unhappy on the inside.<br/><br/>In the movie Kevin Spacey does a terrific job playing the part of Lester Burnham, a middle-aged husband, father of a daughter, living his depressingly boring life in the suburb, stuck in a job he hates and in a marriage with a woman who hates him. A sad situation, and what makes it even sadder is how true it is for so many families and that for most of them, it will probably never change.<br/><br/>Lester makes the decision to change his life when his daughter's girlfriend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), comes in his life, whose simple appearance is enough to make him see how unhappy he is in his situation.<br/><br/>By exercising, quitting his job, starting to take care of his daughter and telling his truth towards his wife, he not only changes his life but also the lives of the whole family. His wife Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening), is a worn out real estate agent trying to keep up with the real estate ' king' Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) and believes that in order to be successful you always have to look successful on the outside. Their relationship has cooled off and they seem to be emotionally completely disconnected. When her husband started changing everything and her little perfect world was in danger of collapsing she pretended to be the victim and started an affair with Buddy.<br/><br/>His daughter Jane (Thora Birch) does not have a good relationship with either of her parents. She totally disagrees with her mother about values in life, which for her mom are looking nice and happy on the outside and having expensive furniture and for her are love and true beauty. Obviously Jane hates her father for having a crush on her friend which she thinks is totally embarrassing but I think the thing she hates most about him is being so passive and letting her down in some way, I think she knows how her father feels about his life and she is disappointed by him giving in without any resistance.<br/><br/>Jane however is an interesting character. She is not like a normal teenager. She does not want to belong to any special clique or to feel restricted by what is cool in the eyes of other people. She is a cheerleader but still she does not serve the stereotype. She falls in love with Ricky Fits, her neighbor's son who in the eyes of her best friend Angela is a total weirdo.<br/><br/>Ricky's parents also have a very unhealthy marriage and not a good (if any) relationship with their son. His father's greatest fear is that Ricky will become gay and he believes that he can only keep that from happening by being as tough on Ricky as possible and by never showing any feelings or weakness (which is the same in his eyes!). Later in the movie we get to know that Ricky's father is only so afraid of Ricky being gay because he's gay himself. Ricky's mother is not there at all. She seems to be mentally ill or just simply traumatized by her husband beating her for many years.<br/><br/>Ricky however, is like Jane: different. Most people think he's mentally ill or just very weird but truly he has amazing depth and wisdom.<br/><br/>I think it's great how Jane and Ricky find each other and how deeply they understand each other's situation, feelings and thoughts.<br/><br/>I think this movie is great because of the depth and the truth and it's also just simply well made! It really has a nice effect on the story, telling it from beyond death and also the nice twist at the end when everybody thinks Carolyn killed her husband but really it was Ricky's father, too embarrassed ( having outed himself as being gay and then having been rejected ) to bare it.<br/><br/>On me this movie had a very depressing effect, probably, because it's so sad that all of the things that are shown, are so true in reality. But for me it also has a very nice, pleasing message, for it shows us a possibility for the future to break out of the painful reality we live in.<br/><br/>It shows how the children of suffering, the children of disconnected, love lacking relationships finally connect and find true love.<br/><br/>And how they take off for a new way of living, a new reality."

It feels so nice to see genuine happiness.<br/><br/>2. scene between lester and Angela is one of the most well created romantic and erotic scene. The dialogues, expressions, music and the rain behind add the beauty.<br/><br/>3. in the end where lester smiles on hearing that Jane is in love. its such a genuine smile coming from a father who is happy to know his child has found herself. shows real happiness which he hadn't felt in a long time. just very good to watch."

","American BEAUTY* was the best movie i have ever seen, after seeing it 3 years after it was released i wish i had seen it in the cinema. This movie really changes people's lives, it truly deserved Best Picture as it sums up American Suburban Hell quite well. These people are trying to live the American Dream tho in reality are living an American Nightmare, none of them are happy although they do something about that and you see there lives transform. You really learn to see beauty in anything, the movie was also funny while having dramatic impact this done for box office booty no doubt. I wonder how different this film would have been if it was independently made. I think all the actors except for Wes Bently performed magically, and was disappointed that Mena and Thora were not nominated for Oscars that year. I would recommend this to anyone it is SUPERB!!!"

When i went to watch this movie i knew nothing about it. I laughed, i cried, i was shocked. I fell in love with the characters or i hated them. Either way there was a real connection. At the beginning of the film, the storyline is so common you can identify with it, but as it progresses, the plot thickens more and more and you are taken into the life of Lester Burnham. The portrayals of each character are perfect, the acting and the casting. The way it makes you feel afterwards is just amazing. it is such a depressing yet feel-good movie, you almost don't know what to feel except that you have witnessed something amazing. The end provides such a twist that you are confused for a few seconds... who killed Lester? we find that it was colonel fits, but tricky tricky film-making leads you to believe it was his wife.very clever! My favorite part (and my favorite scene from any movie EVER) was definitely when Ricky and Jane are in his bedroom and they are watching the video of the plastic bag in the wind. it is such a peaceful and inspiring quote. ""Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world i feel like i can't take it, like my heart's gonna cave in."" That is how this movie is. It is very beautiful and once it is over you are sad that it IS over because it makes everything trivial seam important and worthwhile. The way Lester's character is written is comedic. like the way he handles his wife's affair with the real estate agent and the manner he goes about quitting his job and working at Smiley's. It is calm yet excited, simple yet complex, funny yet serious. Kevin Spacey's performance and Alan Ball's writing created a perfect character. All-in-all i loved every thing about this movie.. the comedy, the deepness, the awkwardness's, and the sadness of the life of a middle-aged man and his family. well-done. bravo. this movie gets a million stars!"

Just ignore the vile 'Star Wars' prequel and the upstart 'Star Wars' ripoff, 'Matrix', and the tons of politically-correct filth.<br/><br/>'Three Kings' was energetic and satirizing, but it steeped too much in nobility. 'Fight Club', the best of the lot, explored both narrative and vision. Here we have the father of 'Club''s photographer showing that he still knows a thing or two about awareness and aesthetics.<br/><br/>This is your only spoiler warning...<br/><br/>Ironically, Spielberg didn't expect this to have so much ""raw truth."" Why aren't we surprised? He lied to us about suburbia, establishing the stereotypes, in 25 years of ignorance.<br/><br/>Here the stereotypes are gone. The father (in Kubrick reference) lusts after the synthetic Lolita, both symbols of commercialized art. The materialistic mother and homophobic neighbor love guns. But it's in the druggie son where Mendes invests his perspective. Just as Kubrick invests in Curtis in 'Spartacus', the photographer becomes our center.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Janney, Cooper, Bentley, and Birch understand what's happening, but Spacey strikes me as being too ""spaced out."" Why does he continually recycle the same mannerisms? Why do we think he's the new Brando? This certainly is better material than anything Tennessee Williams concocted and Conrad Hall was probably one of our 10 Best Photographers ever. Will Conrad Jr. live up to expectations?<br/><br/>As for Mendes, he leaves me with a feeling of uncertainty. From this and 'Perdition' he has proved to be competent and even intelligent, but I hope he doesn't fall into the same sentimentality trap that killed Spielberg. Give him another five years and we'll find out (that's how long it took me to decide Fincher was worth following), but for now this is his take on DeVito.<br/><br/>Something to be said about Thomas Newman, can he do wrong?<br/><br/>Final Analysis = = Learn from this..."

"limma_issa","Null","0","1","11 May 2004"," What is Beauty?
","What is beauty?  American Beauty (1999) challenges the traditional notion that beauty is an aesthetic quality.  Angela represents the typical American beauty.  She is observed and fantasized about by Lester.  Suvari's character is constantly aware that she is surveyed and plays into her image.  She is, however, ultimately unhappy about herself and constantly tries to boost her image.  Jane, an atypical beauty, does not believe she is beautiful. However, Ricky, the all-seeing judge of inner beauty, finds her beautiful. Their relationship based on more than aesthetic attraction is more real than Angela's admirers.  Carolyn depicts the surveyor or herself.  She pressures herself to be the ideal beautiful woman.  Her career, garden, family, and appearance are all aspects that she tries to control.  Through this control she hopes to become what she appears to be; perfect. Certain stereotypes are broken down.  Beauty does not necessarily bring happiness, according to his film.  Both Angela and Carolyn are testimony to this.  However, finding beauty in what you are does lead to happiness for Lester and Jane.  It also challenges the stereotype that motherhood is inherent is all women.  Carolyn, in her attempt to succeed at everything, ultimately fails at everything especially motherhood.  The film also blows away the happy suburban life.  Other stereotypes are built in the film. The gay couple is always shown as happy, suggesting that gay couples do not have the same problems as straight ones.  Fitts is a military man shown to run a militant household, another stereotype that is not necessarily true.  The lack of races other than Caucasian suggests that Middle America is white, which is also a stereotype. The ignoring of other races limits the film's ability to examine the formation of identity.  This is not to say that other races are not important, but to take a closer look at how sexuality, gender, and our notion of beauty affect a certain race and class.  None of these aspects of identity are deemed to be good or bad.  Happiness depends on how each character deals with their sexuality, gender or notion of beauty."

","American Beauty (1999) is about an upper middle class family living in a perfect house, in the perfect neighborhood, or at least that's how it seems. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is going through a mid-life crisis which is affecting everyone in the house.  Lester is fed up with his job, his mediocre life, and most of all is dictating wife.  On top of all of this he has a rebelling daughter Jane (Thora Birch).  This movie has a very active plot, as the action jumps from Lester's wife Carolyn's (Annette Bening) struggle to make money, to Jane's trouble with her best friend and guys, to Lester and his struggle to keep his job and be loved by his family. Although Lester announces his inevitable fate right from the start, the anticipation leads to a surprising and unexpected ending.<br/><br/>
The movie brings about many questions of reality.  Do middle-aged men fantasize about there daughters friends?  Would parents ever use drugs? Would someone every leave their job and forget about supporting their family, just to be happy?  Do all of these characters exist in real life? The answer is yes, the most beautiful thing about this movie is how it opens our eyes.  While watching the film we are taken into a fantasy world of white-picket fences and middle-class suburbia, and then the shocking ending brings us back to reality.<br/><br/>One thing to observe while watching this film is the focus on the female body.  The viewing of Mena Savari's almost fully naked body reproduces the existing stereotype of how the female body should look and be portrayed. This is especially seen in the scenes where Mena is shown lying in a bed of roses.  She is sole focus of the shot and gives the audience a chance to enter the complicated mind of Lester.  Lastly, American Beauty is so great because each character brings something different to the screen; the film reaches out to each member of the audience in a different way."
"bliebert-1","Null","0","1","12 May 2004"," Deeper Analysis
","Under the pretense of perfection, American Beauty is a film which seeks the divergence between artificial and true beauty.  The characters are portrayed in an ideal community with ideal lives; however, beneath that layer remains the truth of corruption, cheating, and lies.  Lester Burnham, the main character, is going through a mid-life crisis which affects the lives of those around him.  He quits his job and resolves to entirely transform his life - In the process, destroying the façade which encapsulates the lives of the perfect American neighborhood.<br/><br/>Females in American Beauty are depicted differently along the spectra of commodification.  Berger's surveyor/surveyed is purposeful as it portrays the meaning of the women to the males in the movie.  Ricky Fitts, the new kid who is in love with Jane, documents his life with his video camera. The director uses this camera to portray that Ricky is analyzing everything around him.  This camera is later used as a way to reveal the true beauty behind the perfection he is surrounded with.  Jane is constantly being compared to Angela, as she is less `beautiful.'  However, Ricky is often caught video taping Jane, as he finds beauty within Jane.  Conversely, Lester lusts for Angela, searching for that `beauty' which is nothing more than an external desire.<br/><br/>The film challenges all nuances of the conventional `perfect' family.  The neighboring houses each contain a gradient measure of happiness.  Jim and Jim, the homosexual couple living next door to the Burnhams, have the most happy and successful relationship.  Following them is the Burnham house, whose family is disrupt and uncooperative.  The Burnham's other neighbors, the Fitts', have the most hostile environment in their household.  To the external viewer, it would seem that the scale would be the reverse. However, the truth of American Beauty is that things should only be read beneath the surface."

","American Beauty (1999), directed by Sam Mendes, tells the story of a middle-aged man, Lester Burnham played by Kevin Spacey, who seeks to make major changes in his drab middle-class life. The film critiques the idea of female characters being objectified. Angela, played by Mena Suvari, is a shallow character who aspires to become a professional model and frequently speaks in a sexual manner. Jane, played by Thora Birch, is the antithesis of Angela, whom doesn't flaunt her body, and shows a deeper personality. Lester desires for Angela in a way that objectifies her. The camera portrays Angela in very lustful style, which also objectifies her. Jane is a more likeable character, and is filmed in a more realistic manner than Angela. Ricky, played by Wes Bentley, films Jane in an innocent way, which prevents Jane from becoming an objectified woman. Jane is also a more likeable character than Angela, and makes the audience question what really constitutes a beautiful woman. In conclusion, American Beauty challenges the audience's belief on a woman's true beauty. Media often pushes a physically attractive, sexual woman to be desirable, which is portrayed by Angela, and challenged by Jane."
"lsejellook","Null","0","1","9 May 2004"," Makes You Think
","The thing that I like about this movie is that it challenges us as viewers to look past what is presented directly to our eyes and see a deeper meaning or truth.  The events in the actual movie seem to just further this plot and to connect us to those themes of love after marriage, and happiness in adulthood.  Kevin Spacey does a phenomenal job as Lester Burnham, an unhappily married man seeking to relive some of the joy he experienced when he was young and everything seemed so innocent.  The one downside I would say is that Annette Benning does not play good as disgruntled aspiring career woman Carolyn Burnham.  She seems to be overacting and like she really has to reach for the scenes when she is expected to conjure a natural emotion.  Sam Mendes did a wonderful job directing the movie and the editing and use of the color red in the film was awesome.  I give this move an 8 out of 10"

","The beauty of Lester Burnham's story is that it's so relatable. In fact, so many of the characters in this film are written with realism, that it's easy to slip into this world, a dark mirror of American suburban life.<br/><br/>
This is the story of Lester Burnham, he's a mid-western, middle age, middle management, middle class family man with a midlife crisis on his hand. That's the hook, the story could be something to everyone. The story of Lester Burnham is the story most males face in nearly every walk of life to varying degrees. Lester is beat down by life, more specifically in a way, by the women in his life and his lack of being true to his desires. Chasing after the ""American"" dream has become more than tiresome to Lester, it's become a prison. He seeks some fantasy world where he can drift around in a male utopia, this it shouldn't be written off as shallow. In this society certain things are expected of men on a daily basis that tend to cause contradictions in character and in life. This film is a sharp examination of men, family, success and your own life's direction. It's also about settling for less than.<br/><br/>What could have just as easily been a ""dull talkie"" on the subject of bourgeois is transformed by the quality of direction, intelligence of the dialog, the film technique used and again very relatable subject matter. The cast does a very reliable job but there are a few moments and thick pieces of ham that degrade and slow things down. A few of the supporting actors appear to be hogging scenes. <br/><br/>As sharp as the critique on the male ""failure"" is the savage critique on the female ""success"". Basically this movie comes down to, what do people want from life or more what do people NOT do to get it. There are a vast number of layers and messages in this film. Studied, anyone could find more than a few that relate personally because of the simple fact of how honest the film is. The film revolves around re-evaluation of situation. How no matter how comfortable you are, your life moves one minute at a time and is forever changing."

","At one point, a character in this movie remarks ""There's nothing worse than being ordinary"".  She's later brought down to earth when she's told she is just that.  Looking the very idea of what it is to be ordinary in middletown, suburban American, and gleefully yet soulfully turning it upside down is the essence of ""American Beauty"". <br/><br/>True, it is not the only film to have done this. ""Edward Scissorhands"" is one example, the first ""Scream"" movie is another.  Yet this film possesses a witty, ironic sense of humour combined with a vividly powerful streak of sexuality that makes it stand out from the crowd.  As presented, the beautiful middle class haven of tree-lined drives, lovely houses and pretty white picket fences creates a materialistic environment inhabited by jaded, alienated people living in deadened, fragmented relationships.<br/><br/>The main protagonist is our narrator Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), an advertising executive who on the surface seems perfectly content but in reality is genuinely unhappy.  He hates his job, his daughter Janey (Thora Birch) hates him, and he's trapped in a passionless marriage to Caroline (Annette Bening), an uptight, neurotic real estate agent.  An encounter with his daughter's petite best friend (Mena Suvari), reawakens his lust for life and he sets about changing things, not necessarily for the better. Meanwhile his Janey has developed a curious attraction for Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), the strange boy living next door...<br/><br/>The film is very beautifully shot, and key moments are well accentuated by a gentle, haunting music score.  But the strength of this film is in the characters, brought to life by a terrific script and some superlative acting.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey is very good as Lester Burnham, livening his sheer inertia with a cutting, wise-cracking flippancy.  Spacey captures his gradual transformation from bored corporate drone to liberated middle-aged adolescent with relish and a quiet depth.  Wes Bentley is only slightly weaker as Ricky.  At times he's a little too smug and self-centred to be completely likeable, but his street-smarts and articulate, subtle emotion just about overcome that.<br/><br/>Thora Birch is thoroughly likeable as Janey, and makes her character's awakening interesting and convincing.  Birch is very well cast, as she's beautiful without being overtly glamourous.  Her attraction to Ricky is as much psychological as it is physical.  Ricky likes her for her earthy nature and unshowy beauty.  She is attracted to his honesty, his ability to see beyond the superficial, as well as his gift for finding beauty in simple, random events like a plastic bag floating in the wind.<br/><br/>The usually innocent seeming Mena Suvari enjoys herself here playing a contemptuous, voracious little slut.  Yet even she finds some kind of redemption before the movie's end.  Annette Bening is brilliant as Caroline, a once vibrant young woman who has become a miserable obsessive, forever taking herself and her life too seriously.<br/><br/>With these well-etched portraits its difficult, if not to like, then to at least empathize with these characters.  This remains the strength of this surreal and thought-provoking motion picture."

","SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>I for one was looking forward to American Beauty. I had seen the trailer many times and I enjoyed it. I also really like Kevin Spacey, Mena Suvari & Thora Birch. But I figured when I rented it it would probably be a OK film but nothing more. I was pleasantly surprised that some critics where wrong (once again) about the film, but most were right and I was in for a very heartfelt and touching experience. With so many films aimed at air-headed, shallow 15 year old teenyboppers, silly family comedies aimed at young children and violent war films aimed at older men, this is, not to sound cliche, a breath of fresh air.  When I first saw this, I was 16, and I wanted something more intellectual, better acted with characters that actually had at least some depth and didn't insult teenage girls intelligence.<br/><br/>American Beauty is one of the finer mainstream release movies I have seen all in the year of 1999. The movie is extremely enjoyable for both teenagers and adults and is very touching. The movie is about the Burnham family. The Burnham family is the ordinary suburban family but in a way the not so ordinary. As the movie first starts out, the family lives in suburbia where they are pretending to happy living in a small town and feel right at home (or at least try to). Even though they are not rich, they are unhappy. So then Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), our main character who is a 42-year-old man whose middle class, suburban doldrums far exceed the standard middle-age crisis. His fourteen-year career at a magazine publishers is going nowhere, his perfectionist realtor wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), drives him crazy and his angst ridden teenager daughter, Jane (Thora Birch) barely communicates with him, simply writing him off as ""weird.""<br/><br/>Things soon begin to change around the Burnham household, however, upon the arrival of several new people who shake things up. While their neighbors on one side are a gay couple, Jim (Scott Bakula) and Jim (Sam Robards), the once vacant house on the other has now been occupied by the Fitts family. Colonel Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper) is a stern, military man whose wife, Barbara (Allison Janney), seems to be in state of domestic shell shock.<br/><br/>Little do they know that their eighteen-year-old son, Ricky (Wes Bentley), a boy so obsessed with life and beauty that they once institutionalized him for two years, is actually a successful drug dealer with a penchant for videotaping everything, including Jane next door. <br/><br/>While that initially creeps her out, Jane soon starts to find Ricky interesting once she gets to know him. That only disgusts Jane's gorgeous cheerleader friend, Angela (Mena Suvari), who thinks Ricky's a pervert although she herself claims she's slept with men just in an attempt to further her aspiring modeling career. When Lester meets both Angela and Ricky, he finds a stirring within himself that he long thought dormant and perhaps dead. With Angela, who openly flirts with him, Lester goes into hormonal overdrive and constantly fantasizes about her, when not pumping iron to get into shape and make himself more attractive to her. With Ricky, Lester finds a kindred spirit whose carefree attitude about life and work -- as well as the expensive pot he sells him -- causes Lester to change his outlook on life. Having successfully blackmailed his former company, Lester sets out to have a good time, not caring that his wife might be seeing local real estate king, Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher).<br/><br/>
As everyone reacts to Lester's newfound attitude with shock, he must deal with the fact that Carolyn doesn't like his new self, that Jane half-jokingly asked Ricky to kill him, and that Colonel Fitts becomes suspicious of Lester's involvement with his son.  This is when American Beauty gets started and lots of comedic, touching and moving moments proceed.<br/><br/>The acting was very good in this film. I enjoyed Kevin Spacey playing in a different role. Sure he was his comedic/dramatic self for some of the movie, but he was also the caring & careless father for the other part. It was great to see him show some emotions. Annette Bening was also good as Carolyn. I really felt she was a perfectionist and struggling as though they were her own little problems. Thora Birch, who was great in Now & Then, played the confused and bitterly unhappy teenage daughter Jane in the film. Jane was basically dealing with her weird father, perfectionist mother, her perfect, gorgeous, model cheerleader friend who is becoming romantically involved with her father (gross!) and her beautiful weird, drug dealing boyfriend Ricky Fitts who is also becoming involved with her father. The downside to her character was she wasn't in the film as much as I would have liked to see her in it since she's such a wonderful actress but while she was in the film, she played her character very well. I think that she should have at least got an Oscar nod for Jane, I could definitely relate to her character in a lot of ways, since I am a teenage girl myself. Mena Suvari played the feisty cheerleader friend Angela and she played her character well, even though at times I doubt she played the role since it seemed like the perfect role for her. Wes Bentley was great as the weird, beauty and life obsessed Ricky who was mad at his dad for not thinking about anyone except himself throughout the movie and trying to deal with fitting in and his relationships with both Jane and Lester. And as for the rest of the actors, well they were probably the finest actors I have ever seen in a mainstream movie and all played the roles wonderfully. I also have the mention Allison Janney, who I don't really like but I liked her in this role. Maybe its because the whole film all she did was really be caring. You can't help but feel sympathetic toward her because she had this son who is really hard to understand and unpredictable.<br/><br/>The script was great! Alan Ball, who wrote episodes of Cybill, which was a pretty bad television show, has made a great recovery from that film by writing this one. I enjoyed the movie a lot as I am sure you have already picked up from my review so far. I liked the script because it showed how real suburban family life can be. It was a nice movie which showed the family going from normal to very weird, wacky and crazy. It was nice to see a script that mixed both comedic and dramatic moments so perfectly. I would like to say good job Alan Ball I applaud your work on this script, keep it up.<br/><br/>The director, Sam Mendes, did a great job on directing the movie. He knew how to put the movie together. I was surprised Sam Mendes did such a great job on this film since his last film before this was the awful made-for-television movie Company. It's amazing that he too was able to catch the emotions that were in the movie. The movie portrays the average family but in today's world I guess we can say the not so average family and how life is for them. It's a very moving movie as I already mentioned above and the director really caught all the difficulties and good moments in the Burnhams lives.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, American Beauty was every thing I hoped it to be. It was better than I expected it to be and touched me very deeply. I can relate to the movie in some sense since I also live in suburbia and I see some of the problems arise although my family situation isn't like the movie on all levels. There isn't as much love and caring in the family, but yeah it's the truth, not all suburban families are all happy, cookie cutter and have minor problems, as there should be in the family. And even though this movie's a quite unlikely suburban situation, it's still more likely than The Brady Bunch or shows and films like that with giant stereotypes, because the characters in American Beauty have depth. It touched me because my family could have been like the Burnhams, which are at least interesting. Not like I'd want my father being like Lester or my neighbors being like the Fitts. I think that's why I really got emotional at the end of the film and cried because it's sad but it's not really that sad that someone should cry at the end. I liked the movie a lot. It was very feel good, shows a lot emotions and comedic. It's not comedic in a silly, slap-stick sort of way but funny in a suburban type of way by portraying how a family should be. The film made my top 5 movies of 1999 list and I am glad to see it did so well at the box office and won Best Picture Oscar even though some dumb critics panned it, but most liked it (it got a 89% fresh on rotten-tomatoes.com). I cannot see anyone walking out of this film saying its bad. It's a film, which I think almost anyone can enjoy. It's not full of stupidity but has funny moments. It has some drama, which is always good in a film as well. To me the film is the perfect suburban drama/dark comedy. I give American Beauty a very high rating of a 9/10."

","I'd hate for a foreigner to see this movie and say ""so, that's what suburban families are like in the USA""<br/><br/>I think someone really has it in for Americans.

I feel like it's a bit of a cheap shot and wouldn't be surprised at all if a foreigner (obviously jealous of our standard of living) was responsible for this film.  Every character in this movie is a despicable sociopath with no morals whatsoever.  I've never met a family like this and am glad.<br/><br/>I felt like I was at an impasse when rating this movie because it is so detached from reality and is a bit forceful in the ""America is bad"" message.

"preich","10","0","1","17 January 2004"," fantastic soundtrack, brutally honest, dark humor
","I have grown so weary of movie critics lambasting American Beauty for all of its 'flaws'. This movie is a brutally honest, smartly written, dark comedy/tragedy that ends with a twist (see The Sixth Sense). I have yet to see a movie where young actors so easily share scenes with veterans. I disagree with the writer, Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe, that AB has not ''aged well"" over the years. I recently watched American Beauty with friends and I laughed as hysterically as I did in 1999. The characters walk a fine line between parody and realism, which is one of the many components that makes the movie so engaging. Viewers can relate to Lester and all of his flawsâ€”in a general sense. Unfortunately, in my opinion, too many viewers become hung up on or cannot look past the specifics of his character (i.e. the Mena Suvari infatuation), which is unfortunate because the movie explores so many other interesting stories of imprisonment, loneliness, beauty, denial, anger, and aging. Two of my favorite lines from the movie: 1) ""You are SO busted."" 2. Kevin Spacey begrudgingly attending his wife's holiday work party and being introduced to a colleague who does not remember him. Spacey responds, ""It's okay, I wouldn't remember me either.""<br/><br/>Thomas Newman, who did the score for this movie, could not have done a better job of matching the mood of integrating scene content with music. ""Amusing, yet brooding"" is what screenwriter Alan Ball comments of the music in one of the many Extras on the DVD. The instrumental sound track gets plenty of playing time in my car's CD player. Catch more of Thomas Newman's music in the HBO series ""Six Feet Under"". This movie is so much more than a man's ""mid-life"" crisis which is a common synopsis I hear when speaking to people about it. It's about fears, doubts, and insecurities that we all have but are too often afraid to express. What I enjoy mostly about this movie is its honesty. That's what makes it so appealing to the viewer because there are numerous scenes in which actors think or display behavior most people only keep to themselves or would only share with someone extremely close to them. And many of these behaviors are delivered with well written, witty dialogue. Hats off to Sam Mendes and Alan Ball for the highly creative juxtaposition of humor and drama which are what make this movie a ""must"" for anyone's home DVD collection."
"karo-6","Null","0","1","15 January 2004"," Controversial, obviously
","I watched this movie just tonight (caught it on TV) and as i watched it, i laughed many times, and cried quite a few, much more than i'd expect (i don't usually cry when watching cinema).<br/><br/>While i was amazed at what i was watching, i was also amazed that this is a Hollywood production... and i wondered if this is (i.e. how much) a copy of some other uknown (to me) endeavours, and how much watered-down version of what it's about or what it could have been... just because it's Hollywood, and it (as i found out later) it won some Oscars.<br/><br/>After i've seen the movie, i quickly came to IMDB to see people's comments. Because, this definitely IS one of the movies that DO make you (me?) do that, weather you like them or not. And, it lived up to my expectation of being a totally controversial one. I think in average there's 2 or 3 praising comments to 1 spitting comment. But one thing is sure: there's no ""undecided votes"". People obviously think this is either THE best movie they've seen, or that it's a total crap, stolen moments from better, real artistic films, or a Hollywood misguided/misguiding version of suburbia life, or whatever.<br/><br/>Now, i can, couriously enough, understand both sides. And still not be ""in the middle"". I think this is a very USEFUL movie, and -- now hold yer pants -- i thing God likes it. Why? Because it is so moving, in a good (very good) way. I know a thing or two about the old God pal, and i know He likes that. From the IMDB comments alone i can see that it turned more than one (young?) person's mind and heart to things more substantial than ""career"" and ""successs"". A film so moving is definitely at least SIGNIFICANT. A film so moving, EXCEPT to those who have seen better ""versions"" of it, and i do believe there are some (films). Of all mentioned ""originals"" i've seen only Happyness, and i too think that in essence, it is better, stronger, and both more real and surreal at the same time. But this movie has one advantage over those films, the very dread of those who hate it: it has won Oscars, and it's a A-production Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>Because, how many people have seen Happyness, and espec. all other films better than American Beauty? If you're not living in dreams, you know: VERY little.<br/><br/>This IS a ""people's"" version of high art, of _real_value_ in art and (more importantly) in life; but people ARE exactly those who need the message of this, and other similar, films. And this film shows excellence in getting this message across, and at the same time appealing to much (MUCH) broader audience than all it's ""originals"". And NOT by selling out the main guts of the movie, but by production and style. If you call it just another Hollywood buff, please count how many times you have seen movies where main characters indulge in sex fantasies (and realities) with minors winning Oscars. Or where pot-smoking and selling (!) by main characters gets no judgment. Not that i'm advocating Sex'n'Drugs, but -- for an Oscar winner! -- this is a hard-core.<br/><br/>On another note, i see much disagreement about ""reality"", or ""realness"" of the film - and it's characters. Although i belong to those who like this film very much, i don't share the majority's view that the characters, situations are ""realistic"". They're NOT. They're not inexistent (God knows thare's much worse things going on around the world and around the clock). But they're not average. But they were not meant to be. They're all caricatures, and representing each a certain portion of people around you and me (us included). It is the same in Happyness, and in Pianist, and in all other ""good"" movies. They're NOT real; they're hyper-real. They're more-than-real. They're Reality Overdone. Because, art simply does that.<br/><br/>
Just before i quit (this is getting long!), i'd also like to mention the adorable music score by Thomas Newman. Before it hit me what a movie i was watching (and alongside the amazing lines, dialogues, scenes, FEELINGS), i was amazed at the music. The best possible compliment: i wished i this was my music.<br/><br/>For those of you who are wondering to watch this film or not: there's no way to tell weather you'll like it or not: but be certain: you won't be undecided about it. Chances are, you'll LOVE it. If you're one of those who regard art more important than life, maybe you won't. Not that i'm against really good art (meaning better than this); no, i'm an artist myself, and i can see why certain people don't like this. But still i think art is a part of life and not vice-versa, and i regard this film (at least) IMPORTANT, life-wise.<br/><br/>Just see it, tonight, and know for sure.<br/><br/>P.S. appologies for excessive use of CAPITALS, sometimes i feel i need to accent some words :)"

I thought i knew what a good movie was (having seen movies like The Godfather, Dances with Wolves, The English Patient and a whole list of my other favorite movies). This just brought personal drama to a whole new level. Filled with an extremely modern story of a family gone wrong (the family scenes are my own favorites) and the story of a man who tries to change his life. Filled with a host of great lines. Several situations that almost every person will have found him or herself to be in, are told in a way in this movie that is insanely comical and will have you laughing till you cry. It has a assortment of great performances Kevin Spacy (a deserved winner of the Oscar) Annete Bening (who deserved the nomination she got) and Chris Cooper (who deserved to win for best supporting actor, but didn't even get nominated). The cinematography by Conrad Hall is terrific, and Thomas Newman's score is soooo haunting and entrancing and breathtaking, a good example of Newman's beautiful score is when Kevin Spacy first sees the character called Rickie, everyone i know seems to remember the music from that moment. Justifiably rewarded with Oscars for best Picture and best Director. A must see for every movie fan, and a must have for any fan of personal drama. 10/10"

"RandomTask-AP","9","0","1","10 December 2003"," American Irony
","Idealistically, suburbia is the embodiment of many goals held up as the American Dream: home, family, and all the proper accoutrements from the best stores. It's seen as a haven from the troubles of the world. No gangs, no unrest and total peace of mind that order will prevail are all assured. American Beauty ponders the possibilities of mid-life goals burying one's identity and the keys to knowing yourself. It's a frightening portrayal of how that buried knowledge can rot under a picture-perfect topping.<br/><br/>That quiet seems to be more of a ravage on the town that Lester (Kevin Spacey) and Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening) inhabit. The routine is all that's left of their marriage as Lester narrates his stumbling through work, dinner and sexual deprivation. Carolyn has destroyed friendships with her neighbors by having a favorite bordering tree removed for the sake of getting more sun in her yard. The new family occupying the home of the scorned neighbors are, for all appearances, perfect. The father boasts a military career; the mother is a quiet homemaker, and son studious and reserved. No one here is really everything their appearances project. Happiness is elusive even for those who have it all. Those who drop the need for appearances (such as openly gay, but economically stable, couple Jim and Jim) are clearly more relaxed than the intense Burnhams. Lester has hit his limit, and a brief encounter with his daughter Jane's (Thora Birch) sexually overt friend, Angela (Mena Suvari), is all it takes to set Lester off looking for the things missing in his life.<br/><br/>Broadway veteran and film freshman, Sam Mendes, has made an actor's movie, an exquisite debut from a stage director. Spacey's Lester frustrates Carolyn as he starts taking a stand for himself becoming increasingly unpredictable while remaining unflappable. He turns that cool onto everyone and begins shaping his life into the dreams he had forgotten. The precise control that Bening infuses into Carolyn is frightening to watch as she clings to every shred of her status as a floundering real estate agent. Thora Birch and Wes Bentley bring quiet and believable passion to their two introverts awakening to each other. Bentley's quiet, but strong performance is a surprise as he is an actor with almost no previous experience. (He is rumored to have auditioned with only a Polaroid for a headshot.) <br/><br/>There are few movies that could give the near-perfect production in American Beauty competition. The photography of Academy Award Winner, Conrad Hall, is still dead-on; illustrating every detail, but never showing off. The camera is patient, but colorful, particularly when Lester dreams about Angela. Those dream sequences bring the audience into the sensuality of Lester's desire of Angela but never gratuitously expose Mena Suvari. After garnering multiple Oscars in 2000, this is destined to be a classic.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"
"j_loome","Null","0","1","5 December 2003"," There's a charming irony in missing the point of a movie all about the point....
","The ongoing assumption that Lester Burnham is some kind of man apart denies the very point of American Beauty: that social convention frequently only exists for its own sake, and that the preconceptions we're brainwashed into believing about life and how we should lead it are often simply unnecessary, or even detrimental to achieving personal happiness. In other words, he's regained his sanity; it's the rest of society that's the man apart.<br/><br/>Lester Burnham's one of the healthiest characters in modern cinema; he comes to realize that simply following common social convention -- the white picket fence, the cubicle job, the kids' high school events -- just isn't the life some people should be leading. It doesn't insult those conventions; it merely points out that people are often driven by personal instincts and are happier if they don't let other people's perceptions get in the way of pursuing those instincts. And it realizes that the anxiety we harbor over those perceptions -- and their stifling effect -- can ruin lives.<br/><br/>
In other words, we all worry way too much.<br/><br/>The movie, to a degree, mutes that message by being frankly honest and pointing out that personal fulfillment, while generally better than the dishonest alternatives, comes with certain pricetags , particularly a degree of selfishness toward people who can only understand a conventional life. ""And you're boring. And you're totally ordinary. And you know it,"" as Ricky Fitts points out to Angela, the cheerleader who wants to be a model, and doesn't realize that wanting to stand out merely for her looks is the most ordinary thing of all.<br/><br/>The film also points out the danger in being more open-minded: that someone is likely to take violent offense to that which they don't understand. American Beauty is so emotionally honest with regard to the necessity of replacing social convention with raw decency, it should be in school curriculum."

","This is without doubt a fantastic film. May as well get the obvious hyperbole out of the way first. The directorial debut of Sam Mendes is assured and confident, exuding touches that one would easily associate with directors like David Lynch (the use of symbolism and scenes of a dream like surreal quality) and Robert Altman (the use of an ensemble cast). For a first timer this is one a fantastic debut, on a par with Reservoir Dogs for sheer brilliance.<br/><br/>It would be easy to go on and on about Mendes and his being a first time director but it is what goes on inside his film that really matters. The tale of Lester Burnham and his last year alive is one that you can really sink your teeth into, whether it be the symbolism of the red roses or the way everyone reacts to their life as if it is disastrous when it is not. This is a tale full of irony. Lester (played with  great aplomb, wit and style by Kevin Spacey) decides to give his mundane life meaning. Quitting his job and living a life of pushing weights, listening to Pink Floyd and smoking dope, his life appears to be gaining a sense of enjoyable meaning when everyone else is miserable and falling apart. Or so it would seem. Look closer cries the tag line on the poster and look closer is what you should do. Everyone is not miserable, at least those who think they are. His daughter Jane (the sublime Thora Birch) appears to be the usual bitchy daughter and she appears miserable, but by finding love with next door neighbor Ricky,  her life finds purpose in an otherwise chaotic surrounding. Likewise, Carolyn (Annette Benning), Lester's wife, who finds temporary happiness with Buddy Kane, a rival estate agent. Then there is Jane's best friend, Angela, who appears to live the perfect life, but who it turns out is still a virgin and is more wholesome than she lets out. She is living a life that we see makes her miserable when she tries to stop Jane from running of with Ricky. Likewise Ricky's father Frank, a staunch Nazi supporter who is as confused as everyone else.<br/><br/>This, of course, leads to disaster at the end. Lester is killed at the moment where he experiences true happiness for the first time in his life, when he realizes that he loves his family after all, and it is his wife and daughter he really wants, not Angela. To say  this is perfect cinema would be an understatement. Never has a film been released that contains such vicious, vile characters, yet have an oddly uplifting emotional center and a conclusion that should be depressing but is oddly optimistic. At the end everybody is left with unhappiness at the end. Carolyn loses her husband, Jane loses her father, Ricky's mother is left with her husband,  yet despite what happened to him Lester is in peace, evident by a beautiful voice over from Spacey who tells us how much he has come to realize that life was always worth living. Without doubt this is one of the most superb pieces of film making I have ever seen. Backed by a mainstream studio and going on to Oscar success, this is a case of a beautiful and intelligent film being excepted for what it is. Beautiful and intelligent."

","`American Beauty': probably the best title to this funny, complex and reflection-inducing film. My first thought when watching the movie was: `O.K. that's going to be funny'.

It shows how used we can get to our ordinary lives, becoming nothing but open-eyed dreamers.

This tough end gives us an opportunity to think and not to commit the same mistake Lester did: to find beauty too late."

","I can't believe that amount of accolades given towards this movie.  A movie about pedophilia, drug use and homophobia makes me question the sanity of anyone who might think that this movie is what best exemplifies America and the struggles within it.<br/><br/>Spacey delivers a wonderful performance while Benning gives a very overdone one.  Most of the acting was very good, but the plot was so convoluted and based on a series of misunderstandings (Come on!  How could the weird neighbor's father think that his son was gay based on a bad viewing angle from his window?) that it just detracted from the movie while I felt like I was yelling at the characters in the movie for all the stupid things they were doing and dangerous situations they were involving themselves in.<br/><br/>Most of American society is not this screwed up.  Perhaps the main theme here was that characters in the worst situations can still find beauty in their lives, but if that involves a drug dealer falling in love with a flying plastic bag, then count me out of this idiotic mantra."
"surffe","8","0","1","22 September 2003"," Certainly one of the best portraits of American family.
","American Beauty is a great movie. It tells the story of a guy called Lester (Kevin Spacey) who gets tired of his routine. He tries to be himself , but instead he jumps into another illusion in which he faces the problems as if they were the worst in the world when these are actually problems that everybody has to face in their lives. So he does things that he had never done before, like quitting his job and arguing with his wife and daughter.<br/><br/>The acting is perfect, everybody in the cast does a great job developing their characters throughout the awkward situations in which they get involved. The soundtrack is perfect because it smoothly follows  Lester's changes while the plot is being evolved. The plot was developed in a such an engaging way, that you can't quit the movie while it is going on, so it makes you stay in the sofa watching all of the story just to see what is going to happen in the end. Certainly American Beauty is one of the best movies that describe the inside of the American family, maybe just second to the Simpsons."

","I'll be honest to admit that I didn't watch the whole movie, but I tried - oh God, how I tried. But I found myself counting down the minutes on my DVD player, waiting for something INTERESTING to happen. I set a deadline of twenty five minutes from the start of the movie before I would turn it off. Around the twenty minute mark the beautiful, young, sassy, pott-smoking cheerleader makes her appearance. And the depressed, near-middle-age father of the cheerleader's best friend falls for her. Gee, what an original idea. Oh, but don't think that that was the movie's only clever, original idea. There was also the gay, next door couple who expects to be treated just like everyone else. And of course, there has to be a gay couple antagonist - in the form of a disciplinarian, homophobic military veteran. So, patiently I waited for more interesting characters or dialogue or situation plot or ANYTHING to show up. [I still had five minutes] But instead, cliche after cliche permeated this movie - the floundering real-estate-agent wife, the morbid teenage daughter, the handsome but creepy boy next door. I found myself finishing the characters' lines well before they did.<br/><br/>The acting was average, which is what to be expected from a movie of this type.<br/><br/>With all the accolades and praise this movie received, this is definitely one of those movies you will want to slit your wrist with the thin edge of your movie stub - as you sit there and wonder what the hell all the fuss was about.

","Kudos to Sam Mendes, Alan Ball, Kevin Spacey, and the entire cast and crew of this great movie.  `American Beauty' is one of the most memorable movies I have seen in recent years because of its powerful, resonating theme - the importance of being happy and true to oneself.<br/><br/>In the beginning, the only two characters in this movie who are happy are Jim and Jim, the two gay lawyers.  The two Jim's are the only ones being true to themselves.  Every other character is living a façade in one way or another, until Lester begins to make his transformation at the end of act one.<br/><br/>The lesson to be learned here from Lester Burnam is that life is too short not to be happy - too short not to see through the corporate mass marketed, Hollywood enhanced, pop culture BS formula for how we should live, where we should shop, what we should look like, etc.<br/><br/>Like Lester, maybe someday we can all work up enough courage to say `screw it', and live our lives the way we want to.

","American Beauty is to me the best movie of the 90's.<br/><br/>It is about the suburban-everyday-life man Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), who learns that there is more to life than just working and having a marriage ""just for show"".<br/><br/>In terms of the script, it's the best work done since ""The Usual Suspects"" (although it's entirely another genre) which also features Kevin Spacey as a lead actor. The dialogue in this movie is not only incredibly funny, but also intensively deep and interesting, resembling the tagline ""Look Closer"". The characters for this movie are also very believable and fascinating (and sometimes horrifying to watch). The title sequence is a thrill to watch everytime, actually it is one of the best title sequence of modern cinema.<br/><br/>The acting of the movie is also amazingly well done, having Kevin Spacey doing his perhaps best performance to date. (The ""Would you like smiley sauce with that""-line  is yet to see it's superlative)Annette Bening is also very intense, and the supporting actors are also very well cast.<br/><br/>I especially like Chris Coopers work on Colonel Frank Fitts, whose depth and discipline is scary but also very exciting. Thora Birch's work as an insecure teenager who finds herself again is also the best thing she has done to date.<br/><br/>But what impresses me the most is the work the crew have done to make everyday life look immensively beautiful. The death (SPOILER WARNING) of Lester is actually very pretty, and the dancing plastic bag is about as original as it is pure beauty. The rain in front of the red door in the end is a threat to the eye.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is the most intellectual in the recent years, totally deserving its five Oscars. The fantastic thing is to go beyond, to look closer, to really experience and adore this movie as much as many people (including myself) do.<br/><br/>This is truly American Beauty."

","...""American Beauty"" tells the touching tale of the last year of Lester Burnham's (Kevin Spacey) life.  At the start of the movie, Lester lives with his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and his daughter Jane (Thora Birch) and is basically invisible.  His wife ignores him and his daughter hates him, and he can't do anything about it.  Except, one night he meets Jane's friend Angela (Mena Suvari) and decides to turn his life around.  He quits work, starts working out, and buys pot from the boy next door (Wes Bentley).  This angers Carolyn and freaks out Jane, and eventually leads to Lester's death (don't worry, that wasn't a spoiler).<br/><br/>The two best performances in ""American Beauty"" are that of Spacey as Lester and Bening as Carolyn.  Spacey is funny and laid back, and a delight to watch on screen.  Bening, though going a little ""over the top"" with her performance, also does very well.  The ensemble cast makes this not only one of the best dramas out there, but one of the funniest and most entertaining movies of all time.<br/><br/>The only disappointment I had with the movie are the nude scenes from Birch and Suvari.  They both just seem a little unnecessary, and could have been avoided easily.  It seems that they were only put in to attract the hordes of teen boys that would just love to see Suvari nude.<br/><br/>Aside from the nude scenes, ""American Beauty"" is a great watch, 9/10."

","""American Beauty"" was recommended to me a couple of years ago by a friend who is a Catholic nun.  She regarded the film as a highly spiritual document.  I put off seeing it, though, because I'd found the preview that I saw in the theater repellent.  <br/><br/>Finally I watched the film via DVD and was simply bowled over by it. Spiritual?  Yes.  This film can provide material for extensive rumination on such abstractions as mercy, gratitude, trust, and other qualities humans often find themselves wishing for, deprived of, or strangely provided with at certain critical moments.<br/><br/>But above all I got the feeling that those who made this film had fun doing it.  I've seldom seen any project as visually stylish, as audaciously conceived, and as artfully implemented.  And above all--perhaps the one thing that will remain in my mind when everything else has faded--the soundtrack!  I think it would be no exaggeration to call the use of music in this film a work of genius.  The muted percussion that accompanies Kevin Spacey's character's fantasies has to be heard to be believed: I've never experienced anything quite like it. The timing of musical cues and the selection of music throughout the film is perfection itself.<br/><br/>I rated this film a ""nine.""  I don't care if I never see a ""ten.""

","I would like to say that I have seen this film several times and it never amazes me more on how I feel that American Beauty is one of the all time great moves in history<br/><br/>As a Debut film, Sam Mendes extraodinary feature debut has been called the greatest since the 1966 landmark film ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolfe"" by Mike Nichols and I agree with that statement whole hardily, but I would extend that honor and say that ""American Beauty"" ranks not only with ""Virginia Woolfe"" but also with Orson Welles' landmark masterpiece ""Citizen Kane"",Peter Bogdonovich's ""Last Picture Show"" and Francois Truffaut's ""400 Blows"" as a panthion of breakthrough world cinema.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes handles his actors like a movie veteran and knows the boundries of motion pictures is limitless and instead of making ""American Beauty"" feel like a stage play, he gives this film limitless visual quality and understands what seperates film from the stage is the ability to tell a story through the camera lens.<br/><br/>This quality is with the help of the late (may he rest in peace) Conrad L. Hall who uses extreme lighting and colors to set the mood of the story and gives this film almost unprecidented texture and meaning (the floating trash bag, the funeral precession and the pouring rain out side a sorrowful Carolyn Burnham's car window) are all among the most memorable shots in film history.<br/><br/>Thomas Newman's score is at once heartbreaking,sad, erotic, ironic, lonely and full of fantasy.  It is a piece that I cannot get out of my head four years after the film's release.  Quite simply, Thomas Newman's Score is the best movie score since the glory days of Bernard Hermman.<br/><br/>yet us not forget the wonderful actors in this film.

"triphopper","10","0","1","17 June 2004"," A poetically beautiful cinematic tour de force
","American Beauty is a painfully beautiful, passionately intense work of art. It says so much by saying so little; it is thoroughly disturbing yet entirely profound; it is beauty in its purest form. This movie is a symbol of all the ugliness and all the beauty of humanity; this movie IS humanity. Dare I say it: it is genius.<br/><br/>Beautiful, painful, intense, passionate...all these words I use are trite; this movie is above that. It makes everything in life seem so trivial, yet the message is that nothing is trivial. American Beauty goes above and beyond simple plot and dialogue; it is a beautifully crafted work of art. The characters and plot are so completely complex and so tightly woven together that to simply take out of the movie the surface value is to be completely dead to emotion and lacking a wonderfully intense level of understanding. To see this movie and appreciate it for all that it is one must be able to truly THINK; one must understand humanity in a way most prefer not to. Yes, it was that good.<br/><br/>I could cover plot, but I will only briefly touch on it. The plot is probably one of the least important things about this movie when viewing it on a deeper level. Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a man that is completely dissatisfied with life and is hilariously cynical towards everything and everyone, and Spacey gives nothing less than a perfect performance. Annette Benning plays his equally unhappy and bitter wife Carolyn, and their daughter Jane (Thora Birch) has become almost entirely estranged to the people around her, including her parents. Each character in this story has a severe dysfunction, and the movie is about each finding his own kind of freedom, breaking away from the shackles of normality and the fear of disapproval, and rising above the pretense. But freedom has a price, and that is the infinite sadness of life. <br/><br/>This movie takes the viewer through a tidal wave of emotions. It opens as a darkly comical movie, then slowly transforms into a dramatically powerful masterpiece. In the beginning, the movie was often funny and often sad. The viewer feels the intense happiness and intense pain of the characters, and moves through all the anger and frustration the characters are feeling. It was a constant onslaught of extreme pleasure and extreme pain, but by the end it had worked itself into a perfect harmony of emotions, taking all the feelings and making them one. It draws separately on each emotion, then brings them all together to create one--one simultaneously beautiful and painful feeling of flawless passion.<br/><br/>This was a beautifully written, beautifully acted work of art. It did something that has been often attempted but never successfully achieved in film: it had meaning. It had truly amazing, well-written characters, from the sadly yet comically dysfunctional Burnhams to the beautiful and severely insecure Angela Hayes to the homicidal homophobic Colonel Frank Fits to his son Ricky Fits. Ricky Fits, the darkly intense boy next door that helps free everyone from themselves, almost like a tortured symbol of what freedom could be and all the happiness and pain that comes with it.<br/><br/>Some of the most important action of the movie is seen through a window or a camera, distorting the reality of it yet intensifying it at the same time. The camera was a way to step back and watch without actually being a part of the action. The window was a way to distance oneself from reality while still understanding it. Ricky seemed to be the only one that could make use of these tools without misinterpreting anything he saw, because Ricky was the only character that always knew who he really was and never tried to hide it. He was the only one that could step back and watch everything happen but still understand it, and he was the only one that could help others understand themselves. <br/><br/>The color red was the dominant impression of the movie. The pure red of roses, a red door, a red wall, red clothes, red fingernails, red lips, red jewelry, and finally the brilliant red of blood. All these reds were wildly bright, overshadowing everything else around it. Why red? Because red is beauty, and it is pain. It is anger and hatred, but also passion and love. It is fear and it is death, but it is also pure and intense. Red is the symbol of this movie because everything red symbolizes, this movie IS.<br/><br/>It is poetic. It is eloquent. It is beautiful."

","I have a dichotomy of opinion on this film.  From an artistic standpoint, it's terrific.  The acting and direction are very good, and the story line is clever and interesting.  But the message underlying the film bothers me quite a bit.<br/><br/>First the praise.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey is simply excellent as Lester Burnham, a middle-aged man drifting through life with no direction until he develops this crush on his daughter's luscious girlfriend.  All of a sudden, Lester develops character and some backbone.  He gets the inspiration to tell off his prudish wife (Annette Bening), a career-minded real estate broker who's sexually withdrawn from him.  He tells off the new personnel man at work and gets himself fired with a sweet severance package.  Lester begins working out, to develop muscles for his new crush, and starts smoking $2000 an ounce pot with the kid next door.  <br/><br/>Kevin Spacey is tremendously funny in his understated way.  He isn't overtly hostile to others, but he defends his newfound freedom in the most subtle ways, like when he catches his wife cheating on him.<br/><br/>Chris Cooper is also excellent as the ex-marine who moves in next door and immediately starts suspecting that there's something wrong with his goofy neighbor.  He's both a scary character as when he acts out against his son and a pathetic creature when he comes to Spacey for comfort. <br/><br/>
Annette Bening's performance is a little too on the surface - you don't get much insight into her character.  I didn't realize at first it really was her - I thought is was someone trying to act like Annette Bening.  Wes Bentley is very good as Ricky Fitts, the kid next door who develops a crush on Spacey's daughter (a high school goth who hates her parents).  His weirdness and emotional detachment underscore the central theme of this movie.<br/><br/>Which takes me to the part I didn't like, the underlying message of this film.  If some future archaeologists ever uncover a DVD of this film, they'll have some real insight into why American civilization collapsed in the 21st century.  I mean, the negativity about family life and personal relationships is deadly.  What does this film say about how we picture ourselves?  That we're chronic screwups who can't relate to one another and that there's no hope for a familial relationship in our society?<br/><br/>I was captivated by this film as I watched it, but it did leave me with an uncomfortable feeling when it ended.  It was as if some great force had sucked all the emotional life right out of the universe and all we were left with was moral equivocation, aimless thought.  Some people - well, a lot of people obviously disagree with my reservations (it is rated in the Imdb top 30), but I can't help but feel this film reflects poorly on our culture."

","I'm writing this comment for anybody who has not yet seen this film yet and is thinking of doing so. <br/><br/>American Beauty is quite an astonishing achievement for director Sam Mendes but in many ways, the media have created quite a false image of this movie and I think it's important to be aware of this before you watch it.<br/><br/>A lot of reviews of the film seem to depict it as a modern-day comic satire, or at best a typical comedy-drama with a little more flare than usual. It's so much more than that, and anything funny in this movie has enormous subtext which, frankly, has no comic value whatsoever.<br/><br/>What screenwriter Alan Ball has created in this film is essentially, seven characters, desperately unhappy in their own way, and imprisoned in lives where they really don't want to be. At the forefront of this is Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), a 40-year-old, frustrated and depressed individual, who works a job he hates and is stuck in a marriage to a career-driven, money-obsessed drama queen Caroline (Annette Benning). Lester is unhappy because of the way his life started out with such promise and hope, and has crumbled into this mundane and pointless existence. Meanwhile, Caroline is unhappy because, despite her drive for success in career and life, things tend not to work out for her, not aided by her husband's cynicism towards her attitude and the complete lack of harmonics in their family. Their marriage is on the rocks but Caroline has no way out because, despite every clash of opinions, there is legally nothing wrong with Lester. The two have a daughter, Jane (Thora Birch). Lester describes her at the beginning of the film as 'a pretty typical teenager- angry, insecure, confused' but Jane's problems are slightly more complicated. Firstly, she's not happy at home. Neither of her parents satisfies her as a role model. On one hand, she has the depressed and quite pathetically frustrated father, and on the other, the self-obsessed career woman. Neither of them has any idea about Jane or how to talk to her. Meanwhile, Jane's best friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) adds to both Jane's and Lester's unhappiness when Lester develops an obsession over her. Consequently, Jane's insecurities heighten at the fact that Angela is far more important to Lester than Jane has ever been, and meanwhile, Angela compensates for her own insecurities by being outwardly flirty and talking about how sexy she knows she is in order to make herself feel good, while deep down she knows how 'ordinary' she really is. And finally there's the Fitts family next door. This is led by the abusive Colonel Frank (Chris Cooper) who in reality is suffering from serious psychological problems and has deep emotional trauma. However, he avoids confronting this by immersing himself and his family in a world of 'structure and discipline'. When this structure and discipline collapse, he loses control. His wife Barbara (Allison Janney) is possibly the most unhappy character of the film, terrified and nervous beyond repair by the life forced upon her by her husband. We don't see a lot of her in the film but when we do see her, we see one of the most squalid and bleak existences ever put on the screen. She is quiet and unaware of things around her, all the while too petrified to live a life of any sort. And finally, their son Ricky (Wes Bentley) is a drug dealer by trade who manages to keep his secret dealings out of knowledge of his father by covering them with ordinary teenage jobs. One of the most famous and interesting parts of the film is the aspect in which Ricky uses his hand-held camera to film things, including the Burnhams next door through their open windows. Ricky possibly has the most to be unhappy about, having also spent two years in a mental hospital, but he isn't, simply because he looks at the big picture, and realises, through filming the everyday, like the famous shot of the plastic bag caught in a circling wind, that there is SO much beauty in the world. And what we realise when we watch the film is that most of this beauty so often goes uncaptured. This is epitomised in the film when Ricky, in filming, continually ignores the outwardly stunning Angela and focuses entirely on Jane; her inward and unhappy exterior containing far more beauty than the facade created by Angela. There is a beautiful scene early in the movie when Angela stands at Jane's Window in her underwear and performs an exotic dance for Ricky who is filming from the next house. I won't spoil it but remember I said it's a beautiful scene. The reason I felt I had to analyse the characters in this way is to enlighten the fact that all the movie is is a portrait of unhappiness, although pure perfection in film-making. The subtext and imagery used by Mendes is immaculately captured, and while on the surface it seems to be just a satirical look at everyday life in the American suburbs, there is so much going on below the surface.<br/><br/>The film instructs us to 'look closer' but when we look closer, all we see is more to examine. I could go on for hours about how brilliant the performances, or the music, or any number of things that make this film a masterpiece. But I'm not going to. All I will say is that it has a truth and beauty to it that can never be matched, and provides insights into so many aspects of our lives we can't even begin to count them. 5 stars out of 5."

","Lester Burnham (Spacey) is a miserable man in what could be described as a perfect household. His wife Carolyn (Bening) is an estate agent and a victim of the tension between her dreams and her actual surroundings. Their daughter Jane (Birch) is a discontented adolescent - or perhaps 'an adolescent' would suffice. The new neighbours are the family of aggravated and doubtful Colonel Fitts (Cooper); the wife who has absolutely nothing to say in that home (alternatively, who has absolutely nothing to say) and the son, Ricky (debut from Bentley), full of inner sensitivity and existential questioning, aided by drugs, the trading of which is the source of a huge income for him. Add the gorgeous cheerleader (Suvari) and the neighbouring homosexual couple, and there's your picture of American beauty.<br/><br/>The beauty, or lack thereof, is found, of course, within the self-examination every character is subjected to. The results may or may not be happy. However, disintegrating the illusion of the perfect picture and reaching the raw parts of reality is, perhaps ironically, the first step towards personal happiness - not to be confused with selfishness. Personal tension is common in all characters, the source of which appears to be in the unrealistic set-ups that they have all surrounded themselves with.<br/><br/>
To me this is not the best picture of the year. Having said that, this is a film that can touch every member of every audience, because of its wit and truthfulness, and, not least, the beautiful and captivating work by English theatre-director Mendes. Spacey is good as always, although by no means exceptional. The entire cast is very impressive, particularly newcomer Bentley. The true jewel, in my opinion, is Annette Bening, who is wonderfully convincing as the confused and exasperated woman, torn by her optimistic yet failing attempts at a dream-like lifestyle. Plus she is to be credited with the most vividly entertaining sex scene, probably in the history of cinema."

","Before starting i like to say that i really enjoyed watching this film when i saw it for the first time (when it hit the cinemas, in what was it? 1999 or 2000? nevermind) but as i saw it for a 2nd and even a 3rd time the past two years...i really have to say that it is one of the most overrated films ever. 8.5 on the imdb rating pole? Thats a joke! A 6.8 or maybe 7.0 is getting closer. The only film i can remember being more overrated is The Shawshank Redemption, also a imdb favourite.<br/><br/>Look...Kevin Spacey is brilliant. He really is. He has what makes an actor truly great: even if the script is bad or average he can make it better. No comment on Spacey whatsoever.<br/><br/>But take the character of Annette Benning. So flat!! I know that it is mea nt as a parody on suburban housewifes...but this is so fake...it completely loses it's point. That wouldn't be a big problem if the personage was played buy a great actress, which Benning is certainly not. She really ""overacts"" too much...she should be ashamed of her self.<br/><br/>And the person of Colonel Frank Fitts (or what's his name)...it's just too easy to find him repulsive...an army man, well he has to be a homophobic Nazi, hasn't he! And of course he beats his son, made his wife's life a living hell, enjoys army films only and in the end he turns out to be a sort of homosexual himself!! The only answer he has for the kiss with Lester is to kill him!! That'll teach him! Welcome to Hollywoods idea of an independent artistic film!<br/><br/>And then there is Ricky Fitts. Do you really believe any girl would fall in love with a guy that talks such quasi-poetic nonsense!! I mean the beauty of a plastic bag...for cryin out loud!!!! Get a hold an  your self...no wonder Colonel Fitts send him to an institution!!<br/><br/>All i want to say is that this film pretends to give a ""real"" look on suburban life, but all it does is to give us a fake Hollywood view on ""the normal man"". For a real version of suburban life and the problems of real people i would like to refer to Todd Solondz brilliant flicks Happiness and Storytelling. Watch them and review your opinion on American Beauty, thats what i say.<br/><br/>For the second time: don't get me wrong, it is a nice film to watch on a Saturday night...but five academy awards is just too many credit.

It seemed like the writers just wanted to put one shocking scene after another, but failed repeatedly. Mena Suvari and Thora Birch are two of the few strong points in this movie.

","Having watched this film and written an analytical piece of work on it for my AS media studies I would just like express my opinion on what I consider to be a great movie. The role of ""Lester Burnham"" could not have been better played by Kevin Spacey and the diversity of the characters and the storyline with the intertwining sub-plots make this an enjoyable piece of cinema,fully deserving of the accolades and plaudits that it has won. It is brilliantly shot and Sam Mendes fully shows off his talent for writing a realistic and bitter-sweet drama.<br/><br/>The range of characters and how they interact with each other is the key to why this film works so well, the audience all know someone who could be likened to a character in the film, although hopefully less extreme. For me this is THE film and the way it manages to touch on so many of todays subjects, several of them still taboo are what makes this a masterpiece in my eyes. People will watch this in the future, only the truly myopic cannot see that.<br/><br/>Overall this film filled a void that was apparent in the movie industry and there was nothing like this prior to it and I seriously doubt whether there will be anything similar to proceed this ground and barrier breaking film."

And I'm bit saddened by Chris Cooper's part in this movie, hopefully it will be an aberration.  As for the rest of the cast -- forgettable.  As for the story itself, the message that living in the suburbs turns us all into soulless drones concerned only with material wealth and praise isn't a particularly new one and is a rather tired one.

"Truth","3","0","1","29 March 2000"," A societal mirror?
","WARNING: THIS IS A POSSIBLE ""SPOILER""<br/><br/>     There is way too much to discuss with a film like this, from the meaning of the title to the music selection during the closing credits.  I will just deal with one area - that being the one positive thing (yes, I said POSITIVE)which one can get from watching this film.  Let me first give the disclaimer that I do not recommend the film; it is absolutely depressing.      Now for that one positive thing.  Although the film made the human condition seem hopeless, it still taught a very important lesson.  Think of the means gone through for the characters to end up in their hopeless situations.  We'll look only at Lester for brevity's sake.  Lester was going through what most people would call a mid-life crisis.  How did he cope with it?  He nihilistically gave into all of his pleasures.  This is a great thing for the remainder of his life - the whole one year of it until he was ruthlessly murdered by his neighbor.  But what if he didn't live for a year? Giving in to all of his desires can only satisfy one for so long.  Think of King Solomon, the wisest and possibly the richest man to have existed, who wrote the book of Ecclesiastes.  After trying out every possible feel-good experience life had to offer, he came to the conclusion that ""nothing is worthwhile under the sun.""  This is a man who has reached the top only to discover nothing was there.      Likewise Lester would have found nothing was there.  Had he lived on, another year or so of pleasure would have left him in a more desperate situation than he had been.  Who knows, maybe he would have ended up in jail.  That's what happens when one selfishly does whatever they want all in the name of ""happiness.""  ""But,"" you say, ""Lester wouldn't have ended up in jail; he knew where to draw the line.  After all, he didn't have sex with his teenage daughter's friend when he had the perfect opportunity to."" Sorry friends, but Lester crossed the line the minute he allowed his mind to be filled with erotic fantasies of that young cheerleader.  In fact, that moment in the school gymnasium was, I believe, the turning point of the film.  The decision to make her the object of his desire and not his wife had many other decisions implicitly attached.  First of all, by doing this he violated the sacredness of his marriage vows.  He decided that feeling good was more important than keeping a promise.  The decision also included sacrificing a potentially healthy relationship with his daughter.  The ultimate decision implicit in the willingness to fantasize was that of making himself, and only himself, all that mattered.      Imagine if everyone made this decision.  We would live in chaos. Morality cannot be based on an individual's feelings, or more specifically, their happiness.  What if we all felt like killing our neighbor like Lester's neighbor did?  It just won't work.  American Beauty shows how ""only counting on yourself"" (as Lester's wife so confidently said) leads to disaster.  Without something to measure against, without a moral law to abide by, life is not livable - at least not for long - as we have seen."

This film succeeds not only because of the unbelievable script, but because the fact that when the film ends, you DO acknowledge the performances of the film (Benning is unbelievable), but seem to put individual performances aside to the movie itself.  Few movies place you in the surreal-yet-too-real environment that this film seems to put you in.

Both Annette Bening and the oft-overlooked Peter Gallacher also turn in fine performances.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is above par, but relies too often on pre-recorded songs.<br/><br/>The story is a standard rejection of modern American values of materialism and suburban soullessness, but says little on the matter that hasn't been said by better films before, notably Happiness, a far more compelling work which shares much in common with American Beauty, but packs a visceral punch that American Beauty is content to cast aside.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film really fails to make any appreciable impact. The message, that one should not become ensconced in day to day ritual over the beauty of everyday life, is hardly an original one, and comes to us rather muddied by the characters' various interpretations of it.

","I honestly don't know what all the fuss is about. I found the film very bitty, with no sense of direction, at any point. The film attracted me to it because of Kevin Spacey, his acting in `Usual suspects' was amazing, and yes he did another good job as a storyteller, but nothing stunning. The actor I thought was amazing in this film was young Wes Bentley, who played his part to perfection. If I had to describe the film to someone I would have a lot of difficulty. Was it funny, well in some parts it was hilarious. Was it exciting, well virtually all of the time no. Was it serious, well in some parts yes. Was it erotic, well on the odd occasion, yes. Was it daft, well that is one word that could sum it up. You see because it was so bitty, each scene had its own felling mood, which could be completely different from another. However the film did not have one theme that went through it entirely, except maybe daft'. The script is what I think let it down. It was well directed, the actors did well, but the film had no real direction, and so no real end came about. Without giving anything away all I can say is that the film did end, but virtually half the story line was left unfinished. Would I recommend this film to a friend? I would have to say yes. This was not a film that bored you, and I would say that with all its hype and ratings most people must like it. However it was not mine kind of film."

","While American Beauty may be critically applauded by many, it failed to capture my imagination. After hearing critics rave about it for so log I finally conjured up the will to see it. After seeing it for the first, I must admit it did nothing for me. Feeling intellectually inadequate and sporting a huge chip on my shoulder, I decided to view it again to see if I had missed anything. Subtexts, themes, plot lines etc. But after coming out of the movie for the second time, I felt no different than from what I had felt coming out of it the first time. Impeccably shot: yes. Superb acting: yes (especially Bening). But the story line and the manner in which the characters interact with each other feels somewhat forced and contrived. The obvious thematic premise of the great chase for the American dream is exposed yet is never expanded upon and one cannot feel the film moves in any direction at all but instead simply seems to rest on it's laurels, contemplating. While I enjoyed many aspects of American Beauty, I cannot see why it has been so critically praised."

The wife cleans and shes a little out there (my wife cleans and is a little out there if you know what I mean).

"The Continental Op","4","0","1","11 October 1999"," Blech...
","""American Beauty"" is the sometimes amusing, mostly irritating story of Lester Burnham, a middle aging, frustrated suburban schmuck and his dysfunctional (is there any other kind?) family. His wife, Carolyn, is a brittle, self-centered bitch. His moody 16-year old brat of a daughter, Jane, hates the sight of him because ""he's such a lame-o"". The film follows Lester as he goes through the standard Hollywood mid-life crisis, complete with a new job, hot car,and hot pants for Angela Hayes, his daughter's beautiful friend. Although these scenes are funny,the screenwriter is obviously trying to make this film more than a simple comedy. Therefore there are a lot of silly ""artistic drama"" touches that just don't work. Spacey is great, but with every scene that does not features Spacey's character, the film grinds to a halt. Most annoying is the ""Dawson's Creek"" sub-plot featuring Jane Burnham (Thora Birch) and the ultra-creepy, drug-dealing boy next door. What was supposed to come off as a touching story of two misfits finding love seems more like two insufferable, precocious brats feeding off each other's neuroses. The scene where the boy relates to Jane how he  found God in a discarded plastic bag are hilariously pretentious. St. Augustine had nothing on this guy. <br/><br/>Annette Benning's distractingly over-the-top performance as Caroline doesn't help much either. Benning plays this character with all the subtlety Divine gave to Francine Fishpaw in ""Polyester"" (I bet John Waters laughed his ass off when he saw this tripe)<br/><br/>
There are only two things that keep this film from being total junk. Spacey's performance throughout the film and the scene at the end where Jane's friend Angela (played by an amazing young actress named Mena Suvari) who had previously been disregarded by everyone as a shallow, egotistical, sex-pot breaks her facade to show Lester what a insecure, lonely girl she really is. If the rest of the film had the emotional honesty of this scene, it would have been a masterpiece. It seems to me that if the characters in this film weren't such selfish idiots, their various problems and miseries would have been solved in thirty seconds. Then we would have been spared this movie."

","There were so many things that were wrong with this movie I can't understand why it's been so massively embraced.  For one, film makers kept switching back and forth between satire and realism so often it made my head spin, and hurt the realism of the film overall.  It didn't help that only half of the characters were at all developed.  The mom in particular barely seemed human except for a few brief moments that left me unconvinced.  In addition, some scenes were so contrived they could have come straight from be grade B sitcom, only with grim consequences.  Not only that but I felt that certain plot devises insulted my intelligence.  In the beginning, they make you think that things are going to be one way but then they present two other possibilities.  Only one of the three makes enough sense to be what's going to happen so I found it greatly irritating every time they tried to lead me in the wrong direction.  I saw certain things coming a mile away so I was in awe when other people were so surprised.  Not to mention that the re-occurring motif with all the red was hardly inspired.  It's been done.

","""American Beauty"" was a pretty good commercial success, and obtained brilliant critical success, but many people I know just didn't get the film. Some thought it was simply overrated; others thought it was just plain bad. And that troubles me.  I cannot fathom how a film of such emotional power and energy can be considered mediocre in the eyes of the normal viewer.  I'm not going to call those ""normal viewers"" idiots--to be fair--but I will say that they definitely have to give this great film another look.  And if they still don't get it, give it another look--and so on and so on and so on. Because I believe this CANNOT be regarded as a ""bad"" film; it can only be misunderstood.  Maybe it's because the messages and morals are delivered in a subtle manner.  People, in general, look at films in such a superficial manner.  What they see is a middle-aged loser smoking pot and his crackpot wife who has motives to murder him.  Just like the tagline says...you just have to LOOK CLOSER.<br/><br/>Performance-wise alone, I would regard ""American Beauty"" superior to any other film ever made.  Kevin Spacey--who I usually love in whatever he does--gives the greatest performance of his career.  I guess most viewers didn't think of it that way, because Spacey played a HUMAN BEING, and not these one-dimensional twits we're used to seeing on screen.  Lester Burnham (Spacey's character) is neither a sinner, nor a saint.  He has his faults, but who the hell doesn't?  He's a stuck-up, white-collar suburban who hasn't done anything to take advantage of his life.  He's been jerked around by his bosses and his demanding wife.  In the masturbation scene--which people so rudely took out of context in a scatological manner--Lester explains that his time in the shower is the most exciting point of his day, and it all goes downhill from there.  He explains, in his vivid narration, that his life is completely pointless and masturbation is the only activity that even closely rebels him from society.  You start to really feel how pathetic this man is.  And I liked the scene where we're introduced to Jane (the daughter).  Lester narrates that he can reveal to her that all that teenage angst that experiences on a daily basis will all come to an end, but he ""doesn't want to lie to her.""  That's how brutally honest this film proves to be!  You would never hear a line like that in any other movie.  ""American Beauty"" really really tells it like it is.<br/><br/>A movie like this has no genre.  It's a dead-on character study about reality.  Reality has no genre.  People basically classify this as a drama, but it has other elements mixed in.  I liked the comic elements, some of which are funnier than I've seen in most straight comedies.  For example, the scene at the drive-thru.  Lester catches Carolyn (his wife) smooching with the ""Real Estate King"" Buddy, who she has been cheating with behind his back.  Of course, she wasn't aware that he just got a job at Mr. Smiley's. He appears at the drive-thru window with a happy-go-lucky grin, saying ""Welcome to Mr. Smiley's.""  There's none of that predictable quarrel you would expect in a scene like this.  Instead, Lester firmly tells his wife not to bother him about his faults, since she has faults of her own.  Then he shifts back into happy-go-lucky mode and says ""Would you like Smiley sauce with that?""  I think the way they handled that scene was what made it so special.  That's what makes the whole movie special.  It rebels against all cliches, all stereotypes, all predictability.  <br/><br/>I also have to give a hand to Mena Suvari, who plays the ditsy cheerleader Angela who Lester lusts after.  She gives us the ditsy characteristics, but never overplays it.  Let's face it, there are ditsy girls like her in the world who think they are better than everyone else.  I'm sure all the females reading this are nodding their heads right now.  So I didn't think she in any way fell into the ditsy blonde stereotype.  And I liked the little surprise at the end, when Lester comes face-to-face with her late at night.  <br/><br/>""American Beauty"" is a film that works on both levels, the entertainment level AND the artistic level.  This isn't one of those ultra-artsy pieces that you only expect major critics to go in for.  This is an entertaining film that is artistic in the way it studies everyday life.  The whole film has a universal message.  Though your family may not DIRECTLY relate to the Burnhams there is some moral that you should get after seeing their behaviors.  Their behaviors are so true to life it's frightening.  Alan Ball and Sam Mendes could've went through the standard route and portrayed each character as the standard stuck-up, morally correct suburbanites out of a ""Leave it to Beaver"" episode.  Guess what?  That's not how it's like.  The Burnhams are middle-class citizens, but does that mean they do everything right?  I think the dinner table conversations do a great job at mirroring how a family of this kind would really act.  And Sam Mendes does a terrific job at directing the scene by displaying a wide shot of the family in the dining room, while boring elevator music plays in the background, perfectly expressing the mood.  Then we slow zoom on the family as the conversation progresses, again expressing the mood perfectly.  And watch how frank Lester's dialogue is.  In the scene after he quits his job, he tells his wife and daughter:  ""Today I told my boss to go f**k himself.  Pass the asparagus.""  He just blurts it out so casually.  And he does that throughout the whole movie.  I'm sure any dysfunctional family can relate to Lester's actions and will probably get scared after seeing how real it looks.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie, everything pieces together perfectly.  This is a film that ACTUALLY makes you think, and makes you think hard.  And if you're with someone, you can spark long conversations about the major themes.  If you look at this movie on the surface, it's hard to regard it as a masterpiece.  I'm sure many think I'm exaggerating when saying this is the best movie OF ALL TIME, but I really think so.  No other film has had this much power over me.  There's lots of stimulating visuals, yet this is no ""Star Wars.""  There's no spaceships crash-landing on Earth, no aliens exploding.  But do really need such massive special f/x to make a great film?  No, we don't.  And ""American Beauty"" proves that point.  This film had the biggest impact on me with its sheer emotional power--which was delilvered through brillaintly original, honest, unpretentious writing, powerful directing and unforgettable performances.  <br/><br/>P.S.:  I also give credit to Wes Bentley, a terrific young actor who I desperately hope to see in many more movies.  He adds great substance to his acting, and he has those deep, dark eyes that he uses to express emotion without even saying a word of dialogue.  He's a great talent, in all aspects.  Also, Chris Cooper--a very underrated actor--is terrific as usual. I think both him and Wes deserved supporting Oscars."
"sddavis63","7","0","1","24 March 2001"," Best Picture? Hardly! Good Picture? Yeah!
","Dark, frequently disturbing and sometimes humourous. Those are the thoughts that jump to mind as I reflect on this picture. ""American Beauty"" deals with the tragic consequences that flow from the intersecting of the disfunctional lives of a group of very strange people.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a shot of a video in which Jane Burnham (played by Thora Birch in a forgettable performance) wishes for her father Lester's death. Lester then becomes the narrator, for lack of a better word, of the rest of the story. We know from the start how this is going to end. Jane wants Dad dead, and Lester tells us that this is the story of how he ends up dead. No mystery there. As the story progresses we discover that there are various reasons why virtually all the characters in this movie might want him dead, and we get involved in a decent enough who-dun-it.<br/><br/>
The movie has its problems, however. I found it difficult to make much sense of the story for most of the 2 hours. Particularly troublesome was watching a movie about a bunch of people who are completely unlikable; you will feel no empathy for any of these characters and you really won't care much what happens to any of them. Having said that, there is, even at those points where the movie doesn't seem to be making much sense, something vaguely compelling about it. You keep watching, even though you don't much care about these people. The story moves along at a good pace and doesn't seem to bog down at all. Annette Benning gives a good performance as Lester's less than lovable wife Carolyn, and Chris Cooper is over the top as Colonel Frank Fitts, the hard as nails, apparently homophobic father of Jane's love interest.<br/><br/>So, there are a lot of good things about this movie. The publicity around it, which focussed largely on the relationship between Lester and his daughter's friend Angela (Mena Suvari), is a bit misleading. That relationship is actually no more important than any of the others to the story, and receives no more screen time than the others. The older man-young girl emphasis seems to me to have been bait to catch people's attention. It worked obviously. ""American Beauty"" won an undeserved - in my opinion - Academy Award as Best Picture, when it was up against far superior competition. None of that should detract from the fact that this is a decent enough movie, though. <br/><br/>I rated it at 7/10."

","First, I must admit that I despise most contemporary Hollywood movies.  I've also found that when a film receives multiple Academy Awards, it's usually a testament to its mediocrity, simply because it had to be rather broad and sensationalistic to have mass appeal to Americans.  Consequently, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that American Beauty had a goodly amount of style and substance, as well as some skilled performances.<br/><br/>I had to laugh when reading comments from other reviewers who castigated it for being predictable, who were appalled by its supposed vulgarity or who complained that it was ""out of touch with the reality of American lives"". I'm sorry, but that's just absurd.  Kevin Spacey's well-nuanced character is far closer to typical than most men would care to admit.  In real life, do middle-class, middle-aged American men really fantasize about having sex with young women?  Do they smoke pot (or wish they could)?  Do they masturbate?  Do they wish they could chuck in their meaningless jobs?  Do they want to live the life they had when they were 18?  Do they dream about starting over?  Of course they do.  In real life, are there happy gay couples?  Homophobic military men with repressed homosexual tendencies? Women who try to control or cheat on their husbands?  Teenage girls who flirt with men to manipulate them?  Of course there are.  One can hardly blame a film for depicting such things.  Very few of us live in some idealized, Norman Rockwell-type American existence.  Appropriately, the greatest films ever made (by Bergman, Truffaut, Malle, Kurosawa, whoever) don't pretend that we live that way either.  American Beauty may not be in that league (after all, it was the director's first film), but it stands heads above the vast majority of ""important"" American films of the past 20 years.<br/><br/>Certainly, there are a few false notes in American Beauty.  A couple of characters are a little two-dimensional, a couple are a little over-the top. There are a few plot turns that rely upon people being irrational or oblivious to the obvious.  And yes, there are a few predictable moments. Still, as imperfect as American Beauty may be, it is no less so than our real lives.  What it offers is simply a look at a man who attempts redemption, and the effects that has on those around him.  Two things that American Beauty is NOT are maudlin or judgmental.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey rightly deserves acclaim for his work, as do Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, director Mendes, cinematographer Conrad Hall and composer Thomas Newman.  While American Beauty has its flaws, so do our lives.  If anything, it is refreshing that a ""major"" American film could get away with being honest about the hopes and imperfections of -- as Spacey's character says, our ""stupid little lives""."

","I went into this film not expecting too much. The commercials for American Beauty at the time of its theatrical release did not do the film justice. I've liked the majority of roles Kevin Spacey had been in up to this point, but the actor who got me to actually sit down and watch this was Scott Bakula. I had loved his versatility in Quantum Leap and tried to see if he could ever match that range. I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>I was drawn into this movie within five minutes. It's a great story of rebirth and rediscovery. The ending, although not quite as shocking as some had told me, was simply beautiful. It was somewhat unexpected and the perfect ending that resonates in your head and sticks with you long after the final credits. The acting was superb on all accounts. American Beauty is the right mix of drama and comedy. You are always interested in what the characters are doing and where they will be headed. Simply put, this is an outstanding movie."

","This review was going to begin with a reference to all those ads where you send off a smallish amount of money in exchange for Secrets Of How To Be A Millionaire Without Working For A Living. Instead, let's skip the ad and go straight to Secrets Of How To Be An Oscar Winner Without Working For A Living. First thing is, don't write a script which involves real people. Why? Because that's real hard. Second thing is, don't write a script which involves real situations. Why? Er, well, because that's real hard, too.<br/><br/>Third thing is, remember the other two. Begin, then, by circumventing all the labours necessary to delineate shades of human behaviour and instead. . . write about aliens. Aliens are great because no-one's ever met one (I think) and therefore, aliens can behave in ways no-one can argue with. They can be flip, they can be funny, they can be miserable, they can be, when you think about it, even a little. . . perverse. So let's do a movie about a bunch of aliens, in the guise that this is, er, about Alienation (no, no, no: not Alien Nation). Because alienation is really an incredibly in thing in Western culture, we're on to a winner right away. Then let's chuck in a big storm (no, no, no: not Perfect Storm) and wait for the acclaim to ring forth and, possibly, awards to roll in. Hello, The Ice Storm. No, wait a minute, wrong fillum. This is ""American Beauty"". Well of course it is. A look through the microscope at American Life. At real people like, sort of, Kevin Spacey, too young, too personable, too attractive ever to emulate James Mason chasing Lolita but no matter, he's off another planet anyway (although don't say so, not in your script). Then there's his wife. She's from Mars as well. (But again, don't admit that: she's really, really normal). And his daughter. Young. Sassy. Articulate. Troubled. Alien-ated. Came from Pluto, but don't mention that either, she's normal, honestly, really really normal. Like the neighbours who film everyone (like they do on Pluto, which is why young sassy Alien Daughter never thinks to report them to the cops). One of them's a general or colonel or something, he used to lead the Neptune Third Division (Armored). But hey, keep that quiet, too: he's normal, too. And, oh, almost forgot, the Virgin from Venus who has a way with the transmogrification of flower petals. She's a friend of the Daughter from Pluto. Well, they would be. Now then. There's the cast of characters. Not a brushstroke of reality amongst the lot of 'em. BUT: this really doesn't matter. Because what you tell the world, what the publicists tell the world, what the director tells the world, what the cast tell the world, is. . . They're actually all of this world. So everyone believes it. Honestly. It's true. Just tell people, all these beings are Americans and, hey, Americans will believe it! Yeah! Right on! Tell the world, too, that this is serious, in-depth, Highly Significant cinema and, well, they'll believe that, too. So there you go. Loadsa money. Lots of awards. And everyone out there really believing that America is like this -- hell, even your neighbours are like this -- because when something as loaded with honours as this comes to town, it just has to be true life. If you've got a script like this in mind, please email me. I've an idea we could do something on a Martian with a fetish for washing up liquid (quite normal, dear, quite normal) who showers pine cones on unsuspecting sub-James Masons until the day comes when an Ice Storm causes his spaceship to explode whilst being filmed from a General and his son from Neptune. This will be entirely realistic and a slice of life from Oakland (for example) that no film-maker has yet had the bravery or intellectual rigour to even attempt. That it will also be pretentious (space) junk is, truth to tell, quite besides the point."

"constructionbob","7","0","1","9 October 2000"," Ambitious, but flawed and ultimately pretentious
","This movie won best picture?!?  Okay, I can understand Kevin Spacey for Best Actor, as he wasn't bad in the movie.  But the academy had to be crazy to nominate this for best picture, and - especially crazy - for Annette Bening as Best Actress.  Let's start with the movie as a whole, then I'll get to Mrs. Caroline Burnham...<br/><br/>(Mild SPOILERS below...)<br/><br/>It's not a bad idea, though not an original one.  Expose the hypocrisies and idiosyncrasies of suburban life, sure.  However, the suburban world this paints just does not ring true.  The primary reason for this is the simple fact that nearly every character is a stereotype, not someone you might possibly ever meet in real life.  The father is the mid-life crisis burnout guy, the wife is the workaholic-obsessive, the daughter is the cynical, disaffected Gen X'er, the neighbor is the militant latent homosexual homophobe...you get the idea.  The stock characters turn the whole deal sitcomeque and rather predictable, to the point where I laughed at the movie instead of with it at various parts.  Much as I do at B movies, though AB is admittedly technically superior.  Some of the writing and performances make me wonder, though...<br/><br/>One of the especially laughable characters is the neighbor's son, who is such a pretentious artiste' that he finds beauty in floating plastic bags. It's meant to be profound and pseudo-spiritual, but ends up being laughably old-hat.  It's not such a new idea-Wordsworth and Browning had much the same points, even Solomon if you care to go back that far.<br/><br/>Annette Bening almost rivals Jon Voight of Anaconda fame in her over-the-top performance here...she throws off just about every scene she's in, and it's painfully funny sometimes.  I'm not sure if the crazy performance is a result of bad writing or bad acting, so I'm guessing it's a combination. The director should have stopped her sometime.  One scene of hers, the one where she's cleaning the house, even reminded me of Creedence's ""This is MY houssseee!"" line in Troll 2.  In case you're wondering, no respectable movie would ever want to be compared to Troll 2.<br/><br/>I suppose I've gone out of the way to accentuate the bad points of this movie, simply because so many say it's so brilliant.  It's not, quite simply.  I'd merely call it decent, mainly for the fun of watching Kevin Spacey act like a jerk.  Definitely undeserving of #5 on the IMDB listing, at the time of this writing.  7/10."

"SKG-2","Null","0","1","29 September 1999"," Much more than a male menopause movie
","You know how some ads may make one character or actor seem more important to the movie than they actually are?  AMERICAN BEAUTY is one movie where that isn't likely to happen, as I've seen three different kinds of ads for this movie; those emphasizing Kevin Spacey, those emphasizing Annette Bening, and those emphasizing Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari.  All of them get equal play in this movie.  From the reviews, you might think this was simply a male menopause movie, in the vein of LAST TANGO IN PARIS, but while we do get that, it fails to do this movie justice.  Director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball present these people as people, rather than just one-dimensional idiots to hang a supposedly profound thesis onto(like the so-called profound HAPPINESS), so that we actually care about them and understand their actions.  And each of them gets their own story.<br/><br/>For a theater director, Mendes also seems quite confident behind the camera as well.  His use of the camera and his willing to take chances visually are almost always compelling(though admittedly, the rose petal fetish got to be a bit much).  The use of music is also inspired(you may never listen to ""Bali Hai"" the same way again), and special points for using the original of ""American Woman,"" rather than some cover version(I usually have nothing against covers, but Lenny Kravitz(who I normally like) did an awful version of ""American Woman"" for the AUSTIN POWERS sequel).  And the script also takes chances and goes for surprises, particularly in the last act.<br/><br/>Finally, the performances.  It goes without saying Spacey is terrific, as is newcomer Wes Bentley, and Chris Cooper and Peter Gallagher add dimension to what could be stock characters.  Mena Suvari does the same to her character(the one Spacey becomes infatuated with), and she's part of the surprises at the end, which she handles convincingly.  And Alison Janney, a character actress I've long liked, is almost unrecognizable as Bentley's out-of-it mom.  But the two I want to spotlight are Birch and Bening.  I liked Birch in PARADISE and an ""Outer Limits"" episode where she played a girl with telekinetic powers, but while she had moments in PATRIOT GAMES, she really hasn't had a role suitable to her talents since until this one. In interviews, Birch describes this as the ""Christina Ricci"" role, and again, it may look that way on the surface, but there's so much more going on, and Birch handles it all convincingly.  As for Bening, I don't think she'd be my first choice for this type of role, but she handles it with ease, and hits the right comic note every time, especially at her scene on the firing range.  It's also fun to think of her character here as kin to Myra, the con artist she played in THE GRIFTERS.  In short, you think you have this movie pegged?  Look closer."

","""American Beauty"" is a surprisingly fresh look at suburban ennui, easily the best picture of the year.  But a classic, at least a modern one?  Not for me. For a film so caricature-like in nature, too much art is being shoved down the viewer's throat, especially in the convoluted first half.  This reviewer is all for raising the artistic bar in film, but sometimes (alas, too often) a director simply tries too hard.  From the rose petals to the ""beauty"" of a bag floating in the wind to some very obvious shots at consumerism, right on down to some very HOLLYWOOD symbolism (Spacey's epiphany stemming from the release of all responsibility and the use of ""psychotropic"" drugs, the heroic beacon-of-truth drug dealer, and the Nazi-sympathizing homophobic repressed homosexual as the villain), too much of an effort is put forth. All that said, the film features some memorable, if not immortal, performances.  Spacey is spectacular (has he replaced Tom Hanks as our finest actor?), Bening a riot, Birch an unintentional ray of light in a rather dark movie.  The script doesn't demand much from Suvari, but she does a good job. Ultimately, this is the protagonist's tale.  By that measure, ""American Beauty"" is a gem, going as far as Spacey's well-defined shoulders (after all, Everyman that he is, he wants to ""look good naked!"") take it. ""American Beauty"" is the best of a weak crop, but not the representation of our culture that it is purported to be.  All in all, a solid effort."

A piece of trash blowing in the wind makes for a poor symbol of unspoiled beauty.<br/><br/>In general, the movie works pretty well. Spacey is excellent, and so is Bening, in the role of one of the most believable but least likeable characters in recent movies.<br/><br/>But the point of the movie -- that modern American life is hopelessly meaningless, and that we all might as well give up, stayed drugged and mourn the passing of our youth -- is hardly a new message, and it's certainly not an accurate one."

"Manthorpe","9","0","1","16 February 2004"," Not your typical film.
","In a world full of consumers and with such importance placed on self image and materialism, people struggle to find happiness.<br/><br/>American Beauty is a wonderfully beautiful and visually stunning achievement in film, chock full of impressive acting performances from all involved. It's visual style is something that most films can only aspire to reach or imitate. The mere use of the rose petals here is a compliment in itself. The story is one that stereotypes the lives of your typical average American, and rightfully so. It displays the faults and beauties of American culture through eccentric, but not unrealistic characters. In actuality, this movie strikes pretty close to fact just by the characters that are portrayed within it. <br/><br/>First of all, the acting in this film is truly remarkable. Rarely is such a competent cast assembled that not only can act, but can interact realistically with each other. Kevin Spacey shows us once again that he is extremely talented and has quite a range, worthy of recognition. He's hilarious here as a man going through a mid-life crisis as he realizes the boring person that he's become. Annette Benning, as Spacey's wife, plays a neurotic and materialistic baby-boomer mom, on the brink of a nervous breakdown as her search for happiness goes on, and as her family further plunges into failure. As an audience member, you really begin to despise her character because she pulls it off so well. In that sense, a job well done. Chris Cooper, also a very talented actor, plays the hardcore Marine father that lives next door. Through extreme punishment and discipline, he tries futilely to make his son ""perfect"" in his eyes. His performance displays the inherent problems with extreme discipline. The rest of the cast is very competent as well. No acting performance is below average.<br/><br/>Through a well placed musical score and vivid imagery, American Beauty moves along as a piece of art, with an opera like and epic feel to it, and surprising with a very minimal story that uses it's depth and characters to it's advantage. There are many meanings and interpretations to be taken here, which makes it very easy to re-watch and an excellent pick for anyone's collection. Very enjoyable and very original. More films like this should be made, and a very impressive job by a debuting director. Classic.<br/><br/>My one and only qualm with the film was the entirely ridiculous pot prices. Two-thousand dollars for an ounce?! Oh yeah, and it's G-13.....right. Other than that, a perfect film."
