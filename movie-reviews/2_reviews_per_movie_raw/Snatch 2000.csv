"dazza11","Null","265","304","1 September 2000"," A movie that has it all
","A film about boxing, diamonds, gangsters pretending to be Jews, a fat getaway driver, a rather vicious dog and man eating pigs. Guy Richie has followed the success of Lock, Stock with an equally stunning and ambitious return just as Tarantino did with Pulp Fiction. The characters are so colourful they jump right off the screen, the dialogue so snappy you want to learn it by heart and the acting simply wonderful. Vinnie Jones reveals he can act and Brad Pitt shows that he is far more than a pretty face and could well win a best supporting actor oscar for his role as Irish Mickey. See this movie!!!!"
"SpudMons","10","392","460","3 September 2000"," A Comedy Masterpiece
","""Snatch"" is fantastic; and not least because it demonstrates emphatically that the British movie industry is capable of rivaling even the best of what Hollywood can offer.<br/><br/>""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" was one of the funniest movies released in recent years, and ""Snatch"" takes everything that ""Lock, Stock..."" did so well and does it even better.<br/><br/>Back are the cleverly intertwined plotlines, the hilarious one-liners, and the simultaneously intimidating and comedic London villains. So is the skillful editing, and often original cinematographic style. This time however, it all looks somewhat slicker and better funded, and alongside the British regulars are the odd American celebrity (Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro).<br/><br/>Everyone in the film puts in an excellent performance, but Pitt stands out as a charismatic and near-incomprehensible Gypsy boxer.<br/><br/>Like Ritchie's earlier film, this one takes a little while to find its feet, but once it does the pace doesn't slacken until the finale. One scene featuring three guys and a squeaking dog in a stolen car stands out particularly, and left the audience at my local cinema almost weeping as punchline after punchline was uttered.<br/><br/>When it comes to comedies, I cannot recommend this one highly enough. If you're after a good laugh, you won't find much to better ""Snatch""."

","I was never really too keen on ""Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels"".  All my friends constantly quoted it, raved and ranted, and then when ""Snatch"" came out, everyone made an even bigger deal of that.  I watched Lock Stock, and though I did like it, it didn't really tickle my fancy.  But Snatch, that's a completely different story all together.<br/><br/>When I saw Snatch at the cinemas, I was shocked to see a couple leave only fifteen minutes into the film.  As they left, you could hear their intellectually deficient comments; ""this movie is so boring"".  I couldn't believe it!  I'd recommend this movie to ANYONE, The Pope even!<br/><br/>There are hundreds of thousands of reasons for anyone to see this movie; each word of the script being a reason.<br/><br/>Snatch is possibly one of THE best written movies I've seen. It's smart, witty, funny and has just the right touches of dark humour.  With characters like Turkish, Mickey, Tommy, Brick Top, Bullet Tooth Tony and Cousin Avi; their witty repartee will have your personal quotes list full for months after watching it.  The camera work and editing complement each other to keep the film's pace on its toes, much like the boxers at the center of the character's stories.<br/><br/>Jason Statham has some of THE best lines in the movie, constantly slamming anything even slightly intelligent his partner Tommy has to say.  Brad Pitt turns out an excellent performance as the Irish-Gypsy-Pykie Mickey; his accent is hilarious.  <br/><br/>Even though the story line is only a simple one (following a massive Diamond through England's criminal underworld), it is the connections each character has to the diamond and each other that really makes this film stand out from all the usual jewel-heist films.<br/><br/>Another 10 / 10 from me on this one, it's just a pity the follow up to Snatch was a ""collaborative effort"" from Mr. Richie and his um.......wife."
"willeniams","10","196","239","28 August 2000"," Guy Richie and Vinnie Jones have done it again!
","Guy Richie's follow up to Lock Stock and Two Smoking barrels is every bit as astonishing as its predecessor. The humour is better and I have never seen people in a cinema laugh as loud and as frequently as they did here. Vinnie Jones plays a similar role as Big Chris, here as Bullet Tooth Tony. His appearance is limited but boy does he make an impact. Even when he is not on screen there is much to savour from Dennis Farina as Avi and a trio of pawnbrokers who are sent to rob a bookies. Brad Pitt sheds his movie start personna and preforms impressively as an Irish gypsie. Unlike Lock Stock.. the humour will appeal to all nationalities. However they mind some slang expressions such as Pikey and blag hard to understand. Good preformances, fantastic characters, razor sharp diologue, expert direction and camera work and brilliant humour, Snatch will make you laugh more than any other movie this year. See it now."
"FilmOtaku","9","115","138","24 August 2004"," There are few films that can make me laugh like this one can
","`Snatch', written and directed by Guy Ritchie is by far one of my favorite films of all time  it is easily in my personal Top Thirty.  In the film, about (what else?) several schemes that happen to go very wrong yet manage to intertwine and (for better or worse) resolve themselves in the end, Ritchie assembles one of the funniest cast of characters in recent memory. Let's see if we can keep this straight:<br/><br/>Turkish (Jason Statham) and his partner Tommy (Stephen Graham) are amateur boxing promoters who, after their premier fighter is wounded, have to find a replacement to fight, or one of the meanest guys in London, Brick Top (Alan Ford), who just happens to run the boxing matches and stands to make a lot of money off of the fight is going to impart his unique brand of justice on them.  Enter Mickey (Brad Pitt) the gypsy who knocked their fighter out, who is an unintelligible drunk with quite a right hook.  Meanwhile, there is a diamond `the size of a fist' that has been stolen by Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro). On his way back from London to America where he is planning on fencing the diamond, trouble ensues, and his fence, Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina) is forced to come to London to find both Franky and the diamond with the help of characters like Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) and Doug `The Head' Denovitz (Mike Reid).  Of course, this can't happen easily, as there are a trio of inept thieves on the trail of the diamond as well as my personal favorite character in the film, Boris `The Blade' Yurinov (Rade Serbedzija)  or as he's better known, `Boris the Bullet Dodger'.  <br/><br/>Did you get all that?  The performances by all of the above actors, and several more that I didn't even mention are all really good, particularly Brad Pitt's.  Every single actor in `Snatch' looks like they are having one hell of a good time working in the film. This story, while complex and with many ramifications from the core plot is absolutely brilliant and a lot of fun.  There are many one-liners that I still personally use four years after first seeing the film, and the intricate weaving of the characters to tell a very simple heist story is just SO good.  `Snatch' would be a great film due to its story alone, but Guy Ritchie's direction is so dead on, the film transcends brilliant and becomes FAN-insert your choice of expletive here-TASTIC.  The slick cinematography, lightning-fast pacing and fun camera angles are right on target with the story.  Add on a great soundtrack that spans Oasis, techno and a traditional-sounding Hasidic song and Ritchie has presented the viewer with an instant classic.  <br/><br/>While this was not the first time I had seen the film `Snatch', it was the first time I'd watched the film knowing that I would have to analyze it slightly in order to funnel my thoughts from the film just being `Phenomenal!' to `Phenomenal because..'  While I can certainly be classified as an unabashed Madonna fan, and have been for the last two decades, I REALLY hope that Ritchie decides to drop his wife from his film work and not continue on the `Swept Away' path, rather, to get back to the work that has earned him well-deserved high praise.  Sorry Madge.<br/><br/>--Shelly"
"ratpac03","Null","217","267","14 March 2004"," The way movies -should- be made.
","Read this review carefully, please.<br/><br/>First off, Snatch is an amazing movie in every sense of the word. There are very few movies made where the director obviously did not let one FRAME onto the screen without a reason, and Snatch is one of them. Nothing happens onscreen without it having an effect on the plot.<br/><br/>By now you know the plot, or plots. We follow a diamond-heist and the various characters trying to get theirs, at the same time following participants in an illegal boxing ring. The incredible part of the movie is how every scene ties in with the rest somehow, every character connects with the rest at least once.<br/><br/>There are complaints that the movie is confusing, or muddled. There are a lot of things that they don't tell you (such as what the dog has to do with anything, but he's a VERY important character), and that's a good thing. Too many movies force feed the audience its plot points (Think The Ring vs. Ringu, did we need the ""How long could you survive down there all alone?"" line?). Rather, we just watch occurrences, and have to piece together what ties everything together, the plot weaves together beautifully.<br/><br/>The cinematography and performances are fantastic as well. Even the soundtrack is perfect. The camera style during the fight scenes (slowdown/stop/go) makes it difficult to stop watching, the sound effects fit in quietly in the background without being overwhelming. And it will be IMPOSSIBLE to watch this movie without repeating many of the lines around your friends. I found myself saying ""Zee Germans"" and things like ""It's not like he's a set of car keys, now is it?"" quite a bit. Naturally, Brad Pitt's pikey is one of the most outlandish I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Summary: watch the movie, and don't expect to be TOLD everything, expect to have to pay attention."
"LivingDog","10","230","294","17 February 2003"," Perfect
","This movie is perfect in all its categories: credits, sound track, production, casting, writing, photography, editing, acting, and direction. 10/10.<br/><br/>I was amazed with the freedom of the use of the camera. This movie will change the way movies are made. Slow-mo, stills, black and white, and color were all used to brilliant effect.<br/><br/>I must pick out specific actors who were just over the top - meaning 10+!<br/><br/>Jason Statham as ""Turkish"" is simply superb - a star of very high caliber. (You should see him in anything he made, and read my comment about John Carpenter's movie: ""Ghosts of Mars."")<br/><br/>Alan Ford as ""Brick Top"" is terrifying - his forced speaking style made me think that he was chewing on the flesh of his previous victim.<br/><br/>Vinnie Jones as ""Bullet Tooth Tony"" is total tough head to foot tough - a walking brick wall - a marine for all seasons - none tougher.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt as ""Mickey O'Neil"" is utterly 110% convincing. I never liked Mr. Pitt's work before this - but this one totally sold me - he is as solid an actor as ever came out of Hollywood... and better!<br/><br/>Finally, Guy Ritchie should be recognized as a Michelangelo of film.<br/><br/>-LD"
"Shiva-11","8","111","140","14 January 2001"," Lock, Stock, and Many Smoking Barrels
","The release of Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" in 1994 prompted a schism in the staid gangster movie genre: the standard hallmarks - serious characters, gunfights, intrigue and damsels in distress - were enhanced with snappy dialogue, and gallows humour.  The biggest change however was the introduction of the mobius strip-style plot line, where the concept of time is no longer linear, instead constantly folding in upon itself, flitting between past, present and future that forces the viewer to pay close attention lest they miss some subtle detail.  Inevitably, numerous copycat films emerged that tried to capitalize on Tarantino's success, but it wasn't until 1998 when Guy Ritchie, an unknown British director, took on the challenge that a successor was found.  Now Ritchie is determined to prove that his first time out wasn't a fluke.<br/><br/>Turkish is a young man with an entrepreneurial bent, who, when he's not running his gambling operation, manages bareknuckle boxers.  Through a business deal gone wrong, he becomes acquainted with one Mickey O'Neil, a mumbling manic motor-mouthed piker who also happens to be a one-punch marvel.  Turkish persuades Mickey to join his stable of fighters, but soon discovers that Mickey has his own agenda, and gets Turkish in trouble with the gangsters who run the underground boxing circuit.  Other characters that become involved in the drama include a four-fingered degenerate gambler/jewel thief, a vicious boxing promoter, a gang of inept robbers, a polite hitman, a crazed Russian gun runner, a group of Irish gypsies, a crooked New York jeweler and a pugnacious pet.  The common thread binding them all is a perfect diamond the size of a peach pit.  If you aren't confused yet, you soon will be.<br/><br/>""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", Mr. Madonna's (Ritchie) first film, was shot on a small budget, with a no-name cast (except for football bad boy Vinnie Jones) and quickly became a rousing success at home and found receptive audiences abroad.  While not a technically a sequel ""Snatch"" is stylistically very similar to ""Lock, Stock"":  Ritchie utilizes his trademark bombastic staccato sequences, and repeatedly bounces off on radical tangents to throw the viewer off balance.  He did however opt for a decidedly darker satirical tone in this film, that may make some people uncomfortable (think ""Very Bad Things"").  What struck me as particularly daring was his decision to create a story with such a voluminous cast.<br/><br/>
Ritchie faced a daunting task with this film: how, with roughly twenty principal characters, does one adequately flesh out each character, and not hopelessly confuse the audience?  The feat was made doubly difficult, as several cast members are big name stars.  Somehow Ritchie manages - each actor is full bodied, receives ample screen time, and no one character is the centerpiece.  With so many talented actors, it is difficult to pick out one performance that stands out:  Rade Serbedzija is hilarious as the mad Russian who blithely burns through each of his nine lives, as is Vinnie Jones' manic gentleman hitman.  On the other end of the spectrum, is Alan Ford as Brick Top, the promoter with a penchant for pigs, who epitomizes cold-blooded viciousness. If forced to pick my favorite however, I would have to go with Brad Pitt<br/><br/>Pitt resurrects his trailer trash look from ""Kalifornia"" and adopts a nearly indecipherable brogue that sounds like my best friend's Uncle Wally on a bad day.  As Mickey O'Neil, the hard drinking wily grifter and part-time pugilist, Pitt displays a wide range of emotions, demonstrating again that he is not only a star, but also a gifted character actor.  And I would be remiss if I didn't mention the dog that subtly stole every scene he appeared in.<br/><br/>While ""Snatch"" initially struggles to find its stride, and is very similar to Ritchie's earlier film, it is fresh and funny enough to make you forget any minor shortfalls and stand on its own."
"sllovejoy","Null","21","24","6 February 2002"," I liked it, is that so wrong?
","I am a 33 year old woman in a flowered dress who doesn't drink, rarely swears, sleeps with a teddy bear, and has never raised a hand to anyone in my life.  But I liked this movie a lot, and according to someone who wrote a review earlier, that makes me personally responsible for the violence in America.  I'm sorry - I never intended to hurt anyone.<br/><br/>As for the movie - I usually get confused in fast-paced movies with so many characters, but when I watched Snatch I was able to keep all the characters straight pretty easily because each one had something unique and quirky about him.  I liked that, and I liked the accents, and I liked the silly plot-twist humor, and I liked the dogs.  The evil men were EVIL (""so evil you would call it the froo-its of the dev-eel"" to quote Mike Meyers).  The bumbling men were endearing.  The music was great.  <br/><br/>It was very violent (more so than Pulp Fiction, I think).  Yet somehow it did not offend me and looking back at it I still laugh out loud.<br/><br/>Oh, and I never saw ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"", for whatever that's worth."
"Keyser Soze-12","9","128","169","21 January 2001"," Just as much fun as Lock, Stock. Snatch is a great and entertaining movie.
","Imagine what would happen if you took 8 or 10 criminals of various professions, threw them into a maze, gave one of the criminals a diamond the size of a fist, and yelled out load, ""SOMEONE IN THIS MAZE HAS A HUGE DIAMOND!  WHOEVER FINDS IT AND IS THE LAST MAN STANDING, WINS!"" What do you think would happen?  Snatch is what happens.<br/><br/>Snatch is a confusing, twisting, crazy movie.  Let me repeat that.  This movie is crazy!  Imagine the Mr. Toad's Wild Ride at Disney Word on acid, and this is what you get my friend.  Believe it or not, this mass confusion and complete insanity is very, very entertaining.<br/><br/>The movie has it's problems.  First off, for those of you who have seen Snatch's predecessor, (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), you know that Guy Richie (the writer and director of both films) has a very music-video style as far as the camera angles, movements, and cinematography goes.  The strange camera techniques get so mad with lunacy that I noticed people walking out of the theater.  I was also turned off by this madness. However, most of this insane crap gets over within the first hour, so it doesn't last.<br/><br/>If any of you people out there loved Lock Stock as much as I did, do yourself a favor and see this movie as fast as you can.  Snatch is a bit more serious than Lock Stock, but when it's funny, you'll laugh till your lungs burst.  It was nice to see Vinnie Jones, who was Big Chris in the last movie, return as the same basic character (only now named Bullet Tooth Tony) and doing the same ""slamming victim's head in a car door"" act again.  The performances were just as great as Lock Stock, with Jason Statham and Pitt leading the pack.  I was disappointed to see that Bendicio Del Toro didn't have a bigger role.  I was expecting him to be a lead character, but he's not.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, if you have never seen Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, I would see that first before seeing Snatch so you can get adjusted to Guy Richie's style.  I still think that it is stupid to compare either two movies to Pulp Fiction (unlike most people), but it is in the same ballpark as Pulp.  That means if you liked Pulp, you will most likely like Snatch and Lock, Stock.  If you have never seen Pulp or Lock Stock, you have deprived your life of culture.<br/><br/>9/10"
"jcthompson76","Null","53","67","22 January 2001"," Upping the ante on lock, stock...
","I saw the first showing of Snatch in my town this past Friday.  I loved it. I am quite a fan of Guy Ritchie's first and was expecting more of the same with Snatch.  Rarely do a film's opening credits hype an audience as much as Snatch.  Quick paced action-to-freeze-frame-cuts introduce each cast member in situations that identify their character sort.  Then we're right in it. It's true, similarities abound between Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  From Vinnie Jones' character's tough as nails negotiating means, to oft referred to in-jokes between characters ('Zee Germans' here compared to 'Tubby Tommy' in LS&2SB).  Still the film is fresh and not really a Lock, Stock take 2 of any sort. The humor is more frequent in this one and a major difference is how dark this film is compared to the previous.  Alan Ford's Brick Top is the meanest SOB I can remember on film since Mr. Blonde in Reservoir Dogs.  Brad Pitt is a standout too as the never to be trusted One Punch Mickey-he's not as incomprehensible as the trailers make him out to be, but still that pikey accent is a huge laugh.  And the scene where he is glaring at a burning trailer lumped my throat (when you find the context by which that scene is drawn it should get a reaction from anyone). The use of violence as humor is more embellished in Snatch as well (eg: the Bullet Tooth Tony and Boris the Blade showdown). Secondary characters are all over the movie and all grab laughs from their scenes , especially the dog and the tank of a getaway driver, Tyrone.<br/><br/>See this movie for it's frenetic energy, retribution for the ""good guys"" is all that ties the end together but the ride to the finale is what makes this movie great.  After all, as a wiser man than myself once said, it's not where you go, it's how you get there.  Snatch is all about the ride."
"ccthemovieman-1","9","103","154","7 March 2006"," Subtitles A Must To Really Enjoy This
","I would imagine viewers would either really love this movie or be totally turned off. It is presented in a different format for its time (since copied), has very odd and profane characters, accents that are difficult to understand, and tells an unpleasant story with some disgusting scenes. So, why do I enjoy this film, being an old-fashioned so-and-so?<br/><br/>Well, because I usually enjoy ""stylish"" film-making and dark humor and this has both in abundance. This is almost as stylish as it gets: fascinating visuals, odd camera angles and various tricks, sound effects, etc. Most of the characters in this bizarre crime film have colorful nicknames and most speak in a strong British accent. A gypsy, played by American Brad Pitt, is almost intelligible.<br/><br/>This is why I strongly recommend you use English subtitles while watching this film, at least for the first viewing, or you will totally lost. The DVD offers a feature I've never seen before: the option of using subtitles solely for Pitt's character. The filmmakers knew few people were going to understand Pitt's weird way of speaking. Anyway, I recommend the subtitles for everyone. It makes the film more enjoyable when you know what's going on, especially with the many slang terms used in here that have to be totally foreign to most viewers outside GB.<br/><br/>Since the action changes every two minutes to another scene with other people (Lord of The Rings subsequently did the same), it's had to get lulled to sleep or have your mind wander. Something wacky is going on every few minutes. The attitudes of the criminals are rough: these are low-life people in the underworld: extremely tough people with the toughest being ""Bricktop"" (Alan Ford) who likes to feed people to the pigs. There are a ton of f-words in here, too.<br/><br/>The disjointed story is not easy to follow and I found I needed several viewings to understand everything that was going on. The characters are so strange, so cartoon-like, that - combined with the unique visuals - it makes it a fascinating film to watch every time. Some of these actors were fairly unknown at the time of this release , at least here in the States, such as Jason Statham (""The Transporter"") but we know them know. There is a good mix of young and old actors in here.<br/><br/>This is a guy's movie with the top dozen actors in this film all tough-talking, almost-crude men (plus a funny dog). It's so weird, I'll just end with the cliché that ""this is not for all tastes"" but if you enjoy dark humor and something totally different, you might want to give it a shot. Just remember to turn on the subtitles."
"jon-larsen","10","31","46","14 December 2010"," My stomach hurts! It literally hurts!
","Last year I was working on the IMDb Top 250 list, and I noticed that Snatch was on the list, so I decided to take a look at it. I was in Denmark at that time. I live in Faroe Islands.<br/><br/>I stayed at my uncle's apartment, and he told me that you have to watch some of Guy Ritchie's movies before watching Snatch to get to know his movies better, so I watched Revolver. I was not very keen on it and then I was not looking forward to see Snatch.<br/><br/>While my uncle was not at home, I decided to watch it. I wanted to turn it off after the first second, because I thought it was so weird. I'm 14 years old now, and I knew almost nothing about cinema back then, and I had never seen such a movie like Snatch, and it's style! I thought it would be stupid of me to turn it off after 1 second so I kinda forced myself to watch it. To be honest, I actually loved the weird style after 10 minutes!<br/><br/>The cinematography was great. I had never seen something like that before and the editing was just as great too. There were lots of great characters and the script was excellent. It was funny and clever and it will you make you laugh every single second! This movie is like Pulp Fiction. You can almost quote every line! The acting was totally awesome! Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones and the rest were great, but Brad Pitt totally stole the show!<br/><br/>I was thinking to myself ""This movie can't be any better!"", but then it got better! Brad Pitt showed up! His accent got me laughing all the time! My stomach hurt, it literally hurt, and I got many bruises on my thighs because I could not stop hitting myself from laughing!<br/><br/>This was one of the few movies that I didn't want to end, so I decided to watch it again the next day and the next day after that.<br/><br/>I have seen a lot of movies in my life, but there are few movies that are better than this one! It's definitely in my top 15 of all time.<br/><br/>It truly deserves a 10/10"

","I saw Sherlock Holmes a couple of months ago and it was very good. I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed that and my friends were raving about Guy Ritchie's style of film-making. So, now I wanted to see Ritchie's previous works & rented out Snatch as it was 135 in the top 250 of IMDb. I have to say I was very impressed. I didn't want to know anything about this film beforehand as it takes away something from the experience and told my friends to shut up about the plot of Snatch. This was Jason Statham's second film, he was not so well known and Brad Pitt was already a superstar. This is one of the best films out there and I totally agree with IMDb users.<br/><br/>So, this is the plot. Unscrupulous boxing promoters, violent bookmakers, a Russian gangster, incompetent amateur robbers, and supposedly Jewish jewelers fight to track down a priceless stolen diamond.<br/><br/>Turkish (Jason Statham) and Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt) are obviously the first reason anyone would want to watch to the film. I cannot believe how awesome both Statham & Pitt were in this movie. Tommy is like Turkish's brother, they have known each other for a long time. Turkish is a boxing promoter. He entangles himself in Brick Top's hands, who is a bookmaker and Brick Top is a man you wouldn't want to end up owing him. Franky Four Fingers has a large diamond, 86 carats, which he stole and he is in league with cousin Avi. Boris The Blade wants the diamond. Everyone's a gangster or a goon, so this is a film which has nobody but thugs. Doug The Head is a dealer & if anyone knows about the diamond, he is the man. He has two twin daughters working as his assistants in his shop. Anyway, Tommy wants a caravan for himself and Turkish and goes to the pikeys to buy one. But, there he is scammed and Gorgeous George (Turkish's boxer in the unlicensed match in which Brick Top has invested a large amount of money) and Mickey fight it out in a bare knuckle match and Mickey wins, so George is out for a few months. Now, Turkish hires Mickey as the boxer for the match. The deal was that Mickey had to go down in the fourth round, but he wins in one shot, which doesn't go down too well with Brick Top. Sol and his bumbling amateur robbers get involved with the diamond, the damn dog is in all the scenes they are in which is very funny. Bullet Tooth Tony also wants the diamond. You know what? Trying to explain the plot line is ridiculous. All you need to know is, the story is set in London and most of the English spoken is in British accent.<br/><br/>Mickey's mom is burned down along with the caravan by Brick Top because Mickey tried to get a new caravan for his mother from Turkish and had said he wouldn't fight till he got it. That was very touching, the expression on Brad Pitt's face made me so sad for his mother, I felt is anguish & anger. That was a defining moment in the film. Then the big finale match at the end of the film was just awesome. Tommy, Turkish, Mickey's life and the lives of the whole family and friends of Mickey are on the line on this match. Being the bastard Mickey is, he could not possibly go down in the fourth round at least this time, can he? Brad Pitt, Jason Statham & everybody give an engrossing performance. The film is pure brilliancy on the part of Guy Ritchie, the man has style ingrained on his bones, every scene is visually stylistic and the dialogues are superb, the background score is also really catchy. The way he has interwoven the lives of all these characters is brilliant. How else can you empathize with these characters who are all basically villains going against each other? One thing is for sure, you cannot predict one scene in the film, no matter how many movies you have watched. Go snatch a copy of 'Snatch' (I am lame, I know.) <br/><br/>10/10"
"bob the moo","Null","28","48","30 December 2002"," Style without substance
","A Diamond heist by Franky Four Fingers is carried out and he flies into London on a stop over.  He goes to Boris The Blade for a gun and Boris tells him to go to the bookies for him and put money on a fight in exchange. Boris then sets Frankie up and has a group of men waiting to rob the bookies and Frankie.  The fight in question is also difficult because promoters Turkish and Tommy have promised local villain Brick Top that they'll put up a fighter.  Said fighter is put in hospital by a gypsy Tommy buys a caravan from (Mickey).  Putting Mickey in the fight makes things worse when he not only refuses to take a dive but knocks the fighter out  to Bricktop's displeasure!  Meanwhile Frankie's boss flies into London to find him and the jewel while Bricktop tries to catch the men who Boris sent to knock over his bookies.<br/><br/>I had seen Lock, Stock and enjoyed it to a certain degree.  It had problems but it was fresh and had energy and style.  It re-launched the British gangster film with some good ones and some bad copies.  One of those copies was Snatch  admittedly a copy by the same director!  This film has all the style and energy of the Lock, Stock and borrows heavily from it.  However it is clear that the plot is both weak and over-plotted (if that's possible!). It is weak because it is so full of cliché and silly occurrences and it is over-plotted in that every scene needs more plot in order to explain the new thing that just happened!<br/><br/>What keeps it watchable is Ritchie's style and energy.  The plot may not work but it moves along with pace that almost (almost) covers it's lack of substance.  So we get the same old cockney gangsterisms, dark humour, Vinnie Jones being tough with a few good lines and so on.  It felt to me like Ritchie just didn't have any other ideas in him.  It's all very samey but his style saves it as he intercuts and delivers some really inventive shots. In tune with this style and energy is the casting.  The film is much better cast that it deserves!<br/><br/>Statham and Graham are the least colourful characters in the piece and Ritchie knows it  so despite being the leads, they often play second fiddle and only act as the catalyst.  Ford, Reid, Jones et al all enjoy delivering tough old stereotypes and do well enough considering what they're there to do.  Pitt is a great bit of casting  and here he is DELIBERATELY doing a bad Irish accent (unlike Devil's Own where it was an accident!).  He is funny and seems to enjoy playing out of type.  Likewise Del Toro and Farina can only help add class to the film.<br/><br/>Overall though this is a victory for style over substance.  It's visual style and general energy will carry it for the running time but when it was over I found it had failed to make any lasting impact on it and I really could remember very little of it  it had just seemed noisy and in a rush to get somewhere.  Sure, I enjoyed it while it was on, but as little as 10 minutes afterwards I realised that I'd been taken for a ride by the style and flair of Ritchie.  At time of writing it is 199 in the top 250  you gotta be kidding me!"
"pyrocitor","10","10","15","23 July 2007"," Brutally funny, a stylish masterpiece
","The tightly knit formula for the average ""heist movie"", is constantly in danger of becoming predictable to the point of redundancy with each new increasingly formulaic entry, so to see a film quietly whisk in and reinvigorate the genre was a refreshing feat indeed. And if anyone was up for the task, it was visionary director Guy Ritchie, sweeping into theaters fresh off his cult classic Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels to deliver his most hard hitting, savagely funny and effortlessly stylish film to date - Snatch. <br/><br/>Director Ritchie has somewhat fallen out of favour with both critics and audiences of late with both his ill-advised cinematic tribute to his wife Madonna, Swept Away, and his nonsensical gambling drama Revolver, so it is easy to forget how masterful a filmmaker he can truly be when given the chance. Ritchie's convoluted tale, which ties together three parallel stories involving a diamond theft and the world of unlicensed bare knuckle boxing in the British underground may prove to be too full of twists and turns to be followed entirely on the first viewing. This, along with the stylistic similarities to its predecessor may prove to be the film's only major criticism; however, it is highly unlikely the majority of audiences will feel alienated by the fact that the adrenaline fuelled plot may prove hard to follow, and instead relish the chance to revisit the film multiple times to pick up on things they may have missed in previous viewings. In a film with as much to appreciate as this, it comes as no surprise that multiple viewings never seem to detract from the experience, but that the film seems only to increase in quality upon each viewing. <br/><br/>Stylistically, the film is in a class of its own, employing hyper-kinetic cinematography and editing, which proves to be some of the most vivid and inventive work demonstrated in recent cinematic history. The film's score and musical selection is consistently pitch perfect, and endlessly catchy, never failing to amplify the seedy yet comical mood. Ritchie's sense of pacing is impeccable, and how a film which opens with a group of Jewish rabbis entering a bank, (which in itself sounds like the beginning to a particularly brilliant joke) only to steal its valuable contents, launching the film into an adrenaline fuelled title sequence could ever be considered not funny or at the very least oozing with style is beyond conventional logic. Ritchie also proves to have a real eye for location, and in each scene the viewer feels fully immersed in the grunge and filth of the underground, making the film that much more effective. <br/><br/>The ensemble cast rise to the challenge of bringing Ritchie's brilliant screenplay to life, and turn out universally superb performances, each creating a unique and memorable character, complete with catchy names. Jason Statham is consistently strong as boxing promoter Turkish; his deadpan delivery and excellent narration carry the film wonderfully. Steven Graham similarly raises many a laugh as his consistently dumbfounded sidekick, Tommy. Benicio Del Toro makes wonderful use of his far too brief screen time as gambling addicted diamond thief Franky Four Fingers - his Las Vegas gambling flashbacks are nothing less than flat out hilarious. Ritchie favourite Vinnie Jones is savagely hilarious as mercenary Bullet Tooth Tony (a role it would seem is only a step away from his real life persona) and Russian actor Rade Serbedzija creates a simply classic character as arms dealer 'Boris the Blade'. Character actor Alan Ford makes for an exquisitely menacing antagonist as gambling shark 'Brick Top', and Robbie Gee and Lennie James are consistently hilarious as thoroughly unlucky attempted jewellery thieves. But surprisingly enough, the film's unlikely standout proves without a question to be its biggest star: Brad Pitt, waltzing in to steal the show as incomprehensible 'Pikey' boxer Mickey - an egoless and thoroughly hilarious performance. <br/><br/>Though this may be familiar ground for those who have seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Guy Ritchie's Snatch is no less enjoyable as a result - brutally violent, caustic and hilarious, with Ritchie's trademark sense of incomparable style. Snatch excels in every possible aspect, and the truly talented cast bring their vibrant characters to life with unquestionable flair, each one flat out hilarious when given their moment to shine. Though all of the film's intricacies may not be entirely clear on the first viewing, this only makes each following viewing all the more intriguing and entertaining. For those who have yet to appreciate the cinematic genius that is Snatch... don't wait for protection from ""Zee Germans"", simply see it!<br/><br/>-10/10"

","Greed. It's everywhere if you just look for it. The fact that the film is called Snatch shows the main theme of the movie. The word ""snatch"" means to seize something in haste, which shows that greed is the motivational factor for all characters in the film. Vinny and Sol's use of fake guns b/c they were cheaper than real ones. The movie ends with the circle of wealth still being passed on to others. Boris shows his greed in the scene where he cuts off Franky's entire arm, he obviously only needed to cut his hand to get the suitcase, but took more than he needed. Recurring instances of pigs show greed also, sausages, Brick Top's pigs, etc. When the dog is given the toy, it greedily swallows it whole. Many instances of fighting for money. <br/><br/>The movie has a widely diverse cast, which shows the interaction between cultures for the purpose of trade. Each of the character's names represents a common quality of their individual culture. In most societies, Men are dominant in the making and handling of money. This is why the film has no females in it's cast. Women are shown mostly with wealthy men, possibly possessions of these men. Greed is brilliantly presented in subtle and extreme ways throughout the entire movie. It makes the film more interesting to watch after you think about this."

Why Guy Ritchie didn't do more like this I couldn't guess (Lock, stock & 2 smoking barrels is also a must see). Unlike most American movies, the acting is all around phenomenal, but the best performances go to the actors playing Brick Top & Bullet Tooth Tony. The story has so many twists and it'll keep you guessing until the end. The humor in this is very dark, & the film has a certain ""grittiness"" to it that is perfect for the story & characters.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor, & check this out. You won't be disappointed."

","""Snatch"" is a lot like ""Lock Stock"" in many ways. The formulas are exactly the same, and we have quirky characters, and scene-stealing Vinnie Jones always ready to slam a guys head in a car door. And of course a lot of underdogs getting to the top by some freak accident. It's differences are the presence of American actors (Benicio Del Toro, Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina) and in some ways it is more American. It's a lot more violent than ""Lock Stock"" and has more of a darkness to it. I'm teeter tottering whether I like the more violence and darkness in this Guy Ritchie project. I don't know whether I'm a big fan of the violence in this one, or maybe I just don't like hand to hand combat. The darkness is attributed with characters who have more depth than the characters in ""Lock Stock"". Though Brad Pitt's character is very funny, there is a moment, when his caravan is burning down, of a sad intensity in his eyes, there was nothing like this in ""Lock Stock"". I think Guy Ritchie's character development shows that he has grown more from his first project. Though he is following the same formulas as his previous work, there is more elements added to ""Snatch"". I highly suggest if you haven't seen ""Snatch"" or ""Lock Stock"", I suggest seeing ""Lock stock"" first. Because they are highly comparable (as if you couldn't tell) and ""Lock stock"" will help you bone up on the way Guy Ritchie writes and directs. I also suggest if you're new to Guy Ritchie to get a pad and paper and play connect the dots between all the characters. It's kind of hard doing it in your head like I did when I watched ""Snatch."""
"Flagrant-Baronessa","8","5","7","5 August 2006"," Weeding through the Cockney slang is half the experience
","In this fast-paced thriller-comedy Ritchie again takes us into the 'underworld' of England and this time he does it with more assured direction than in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. This is a world full of tough, gritty and eccentric characters who cheat each other on everything from rigged unlicensed boxing games to multi-million pound diamond heists. This heist is central to the wide montage of characters in Snatch who all want a piece of the action.<br/><br/>Snatch has one of the greatest opening credits in film history. It follows then, that the rest of the film should be equally entertaining and stylish, and it just about makes it. It is a viciously styled thrill of crime, humour and attitude almost solely propelled by the dialogue and interactions of its characters. There are no sugarcoating action effects or stunning visuals to detract - the core is the focus, and the core is its many dynamic characters, like Bricktop, Turkish and Tony and the hilarious situations they get themselves into. The stupidity and amateurism of these 'gangsters' provide for the comedic effect, as is Richie's style.<br/><br/>The only slight flaw, as I can see it, is the lack of cinematic harmony. In other words, there is no traceable thread throughout the film - more likes a series of entertaining scenes. You know how some people are just born to write, and others have to practice to get to the same level or articulation and vocabulary - but ultimately, the idea of 'what sounds good' cannot be taught and the natural writer will be the better one. It is probably the same in direction, and Guy Ritchie is not a natural talent as there is no harmony. It's pretty good yes, but not harmonic.<br/><br/>When I say more 'assured' direction on Richie's part, I mean that in Snatch, every scene and character serves a purpose - unlike in Lock, Stock where longer segments were often used. But above all, you can tell that the director had fun with the script because it translates so well in the film. It is more hilarious than anything, and the accents provide for half the comedy. A wildly entertaining and highly stylish crime film. 8/10"

","Snatch starts in Antwerp where four guy's dressed as Jewish Rabai's gain entry & steal an 86 carat diamond from a building, one of the gang Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) smuggles it into London where he plans to sell it to crooked jewellery dealer Doug 'The Head' Denovitz (Mike Reid), however his Russian mates double cross him & informs shady Russian gangster Boris 'The Blade' Yurinov (Rade Serbedzija) who hires two petty criminals Vincent (Robbie Gee) & Sol (Lennie James). Meanwhile boxing promoter Turkish (Jason Statham) & his mate Tommy (Stephen Graham) are in big trouble as they have let down a vicious crime boss named Brick Top (Alan Ford), throw in some Irish pikey's, unlicensed boxing matches, dead bodies, betting shop hold ups & add hard as nails Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) hired to sort everything out as everyone's problems become connected...<br/><br/>This British American co-production was written & directed by Madonna's other half Guy Ritchie & I'll say it straight away, Snatch is one of my favourite films of all time, period. I must admit after watching it again last night I wasn't looking forward to looking it up on the IMDb for fear of a horribly low score & lots of complaints from people about not understanding or getting it, particularly Americans, so imagine my surprise & delight when I discovered that Snatch is in fact in the IMDb's Top 250 films list (currently #183 but this will change sooner or later) & it certainly isn't a film which I thought would come into most people's heads when talking about the best 200 odd films ever made so I guess it's a testament to just how good Snatch is in that after 7 years from it's original release it still holds a place in the IMDb's Top 250 films of all time. A place, I might add, that I think it fully deserves. 'Who took the jam outta your doughnut?', 'You took the f*cking jam outta my doughnut!'. The script by Ritchie is quite simply the funniest thing ever put to film, I have seen Snatch several times & I still p*ss myself laughing at some of the one-liners, sarcastic jokes, humour, twists, character's & events. Snatch has more quotable lines of dialogue in it than any other film I've seen, I myself have used the 'how did you lose it, it's hardly a set of f*cking car keys' line so many times & never miss an opportunity to use it! The whole film maybe gets a little bit too silly at the end but who cares when it's this clever, this fun, this hilarious & this entertaining? 'What's in the car?', 'Seats and a steering wheel'. I'm sorry, I just love the one-liners in this & can just quote them all day long & not get bored. I love Snatch, I thinks it is absolutely brilliant in every single way from the character's to the clever plot which keeps you on your toes to the hilariously funny dialogue. Snatch is one of the few films about which I simply can't find anything negative to say at all, the absolutely perfect film to watch with some mates on DVD.<br/><br/>Director Ritchie pulls out all the stop with an incredibly stylish & fast moving comedy crime thriller, the editing, the camera moves & the dull colour schemes which sum up the British weather perfectly just work like a dream in every respect. There's not much graphic violence although there's loads of profanity & bad language. There's plenty of clever visual gags as well as the funny one-liners & Snatch is just great to both listen to & watch. 'There are two types of balls. There are big brave balls & there are little mincey faggot balls.'<br/><br/>With a modest sounding budget of about $10,000,000, well by Hollywood standards it's modest, Snatch has a perfect gloomy British look to it & there's some nice location shooting in & around London. The acting is brilliant from a great cast, everyone plays their roles straight & it's just so funny.<br/><br/>Snatch is just about the perfect film, still being in the IMDb Top 250 films is by no means a guarantee of quality but it proves it has legs across a broad range of people most of who I'm pleased to discover get it & love it as much as I do. Guy Ritchie will never make another film as good as Snatch (just look at his next full feature film Swept Away (2002) staring his wife Madonna) & you will never see as good a comedy crime thriller as Snatch, that I promise you."

","(r#93)<br/><br/>Whine, whine, whine, is that all you people know how to do? I mean, sorry to burst your bubble, but Snatch is not the kind of film you give an in-depth analysis. Snatch is a roller-coaster ride that you just sit back and enjoy. It is a brilliantly funny movie, with an unimportant story which still takes a couple of viewings to fully absorb. Add to that a fantastic cast, including Benicio Del Toro, Vinnie Jones, Jason Statham, Brad Pitt, the dog, and Alan Ford as the sweet-natured Brick Top. Add to *that* that Guy Ritchie's fantastic way of using his camera and music to give the fantastic flair that is the trademark of his ""lorry-gangsta"" films. What more could you want?<br/><br/>Everyone's raving about Brad Pitt's performance as the incomprehensible Mickey, and yes, he's great. But Rabe Serbedzija doesn't get nearly enough attention as Boris the Blade! This guy is pure comic genius. Watch the scene where he's selling a gun to Turkish's partner Tommy. A fantastic actor all around. But what am I talking about? Literally every single actor is hilarious in this film. Benicio Del Toro is a complete psycho, Jason Statham keeps burning his buddy Tommy, Alan Ford is brutal (in more than one way) as the crime boss who feeds people to the pigs. The rather unknown Robbie Gee, Lennie James and Ade all hit the right notes as three slightly-less-than-competent street thugs.<br/><br/>Do I even need to say that the script is utterly brilliant? Who can forget these lines?? ""I shoot you! You go down!""; ""It was two minutes five minutes ago!""; ""What? You don't think I've got the vitamins?""; ""Do you know what 'nemesis' means?""; ""It was *behind* you, Tyrone. When you reverse, things tend to come up from behind you!""; ""Tommy, 'the tit', is praying. And if he isn't, he f-ing should be.""; ""Don't snatch!""; ""I love this song!""; ""Anything to declare?"" ""Yeah. Don't go to England.""; the list goes on and on.<br/><br/>Overall a hilarious, forgettable, but instantly quotable flick to just turn on and enjoy the hell out of whenever you're bored. And what's wrong with that? Do you really want every film to change your life? Snatch is entertainment at its finest, and if you have to whine about 1-dimensional characters, bad storyline, or style over substance, start a blog.

","This is top-class entertainment. The movie is brilliantly constructed and has its own unique style. Both the story and characters are over-the-top and therefor also extremely fun.<br/><br/>This is a movie were basically is very little wrong with. It's some perfect mindless entertainment but with a complicated storyline. So it's still a sort of movie with a story, which you have to pay a lot of attention to, while watching. The movie is made in the same style as the previous Guy Ritchie movie, ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". There are lots of similarities between these two movies, so if you liked ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" you'll most likely also really like this movie as well.<br/><br/>Main difference with ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" though, is that this movie has a 'bigger' cast with some more well known names in it. Jason Statham who made his debut in ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" plays the main character in this movie. Brad Pitt plays a very fun role and fits surprisingly well into the typical British storyline and atmosphere of the movie. Also well known actors like Benicio Del Toro and Dennis Farina fit in very well into the story and the movie in general. But perhaps the biggest positive surprise of the movie was Vinnie Jones. He had been given quite some dialog in this movie and he shows that he really can act. Most movies he plays in, he is given very little dialog, a shame because judging by just this movie, he is a very talented actor.<br/><br/>Maybe the movie becomes a bit too complex at times, which is mainly due to the very many characters that play a prominent role in the story. It perhaps gets a bit too much at times but overall it doesn't make the movie any less fun to watch, just more (too much) complicated.<br/><br/>The movie has some very fun and original moments in the story, even though the movie is a bit too similar to ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" at times. Which is also the main reason why I still regard ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" as a better movie. It came first and therefor it's more original and refreshing. Basically ""Snatch."" is just more of the same. Not that more of the same is a bad thing in this case but it's just of course not as refreshing and original as with ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" was the case.<br/><br/>If you like a well constructed movie with a solid and complex story told from multiple points of views this is a sort of movie that you'll love. Also highly recommendable if you liked ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", of course.

","Upper middle-class mockney Guy Ritchie virtually remakes his previous hit LOCK,STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS,but this time with a larger budget,the addition of a Hollywood big-name (Brad Pitt),and even more flamboyant surface style than before.But this does not disguise the excessively complicated plot,the rather glib characterisations (not enhanced by jokey,Runyonese monikers),and the undoubted emptiness that lies beneath Ritchie's directorial excesses which threatened to get out of hand on LOCK STOCK;it certainly goes several miles overboard in SNATCH,which is to the film's considerable detriment.It is quite obvious that Ritchie is impersonating such American filmmakers as Scorcese and Tarantino (who himself has always been somewhat derivative of other directors,and judging by his recent efforts seems to be running out of the ideas he once had),though the gangster epics made by the aforementioned had far more style,depth,wit and conviction about them.Ritchie's closeted,wealthy background means that his essay in low-life criminality comes across as a caricatured,stylised fantasy,which admittedly is slick and very fast-paced,but lacking in the slightest bit of profundity.He may think his various directorial flourishes which he frequently employs here (and to a somewhat lesser extent in LOCK STOCK) are clever and the epitome of innovation,but they are actually anything but;merely designed to cover the obviousness of the plot,they rapidly become wearisomely flashy,and so resistibly self regarding as to become monstrous and indeed wholly pointless and unnecessary;subtler and quieter directorial techniques would've been much more credible and effective.<br/><br/>The cast involved (Alan Ford,Jason Statham,Lennie James,Dennis Farina among them) appearing as various English,American and Russian mobsters are mostly adequate but are merely reduced to a back-seat ensemble due to Ritchie's directorial self-gratification.As with LOCK STOCK,Vinnie Jones plays Vinnie Jones again,though with even less persuasion this time,the soundtrack includes a tune from Ritchie's future spouse Madonna (it's doubtful much money had to paid for the copyright there),and Pitt is rather foolish as a virtually unintelligible Irish Traveller who gets dragged in to this most complex of stories.The only female role of any note comes from Sorcha Cusack as Pitt's mother,and that consists of a mere sprinkling of exposition. SNATCH has it's merits but like it's somewhat better predecessor LOCK STOCK,mostly gives the undeniable impression that it is overwhelmingly pleased with it's own bravado,which when you look more closely is not as outstanding as it believes it is.And Ritchie's subsequent flops (SWEPT AWAY,REVOLVER) means he will have to tone down his narcissism very soon or his career may never recover.<br/><br/>RATING:5 and a half out of 10."

","I really looked forward to watching Snatch. Not only was it from the director of 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', one of my favourite UK movies of all time, but it had Brad Pitt in, who since Twelve Monkeys and Fight Club is my numero uno cool actor.<br/><br/>But I ended up greeting many of the attempts at humour with a stoney face, found some of the images (notably the one with the body bags) just gross and distasteful and the entire plot lacking in the FUN that had been Lock, Stock.<br/><br/>The plot didn't seem to weave as much - the diamond changed hands predictably, the comedy dog wasn't and some of the gags were so...sitcom-like. Ooooh...a fat man having trouble getting out the car.<br/><br/>The characters were bad too. Ah, he has a cockney accent that's all  we need to know about him. Ah, everyone f***ing hates Pikies. That's funny repetition.<br/><br/>The violence didn't fit with the cheeky style the film attempted...It makes me angry to think how much better Lock, Stock is. And it's a warning to ppl making a 'next' movie - change the plot, setting, chracters, tone, etc. so that comparisons between two movies are left abstract.<br/><br/>Snatch is the half-backed sequel to Lock, Stock. But Ritchie sold out earlier than Lucas. If you look carefully you can see Ewoks everywhere.....or is it just lack of originality?"

So, if you are not an adolescent boy, don't waste your time and electricity watching this movie despite the talented actors who signed on to collect monies to pay their bills.<br/><br/>That being said, IMDb's Guy Ritchie biographer quotes Ritchie as saying, ""He never attended film school, saying that the work of film school graduates was boring and unwatchable.""

"Horst_In_Translation","4","21","53","27 September 2016"," Has a film ever tried harder to be cool?
","""Snatch"" is a British English-language film from 2000, so it is already over 15 years old. The writer and director is Guy Ritchie and this film came out shortly before he married Madonna. The cast includes many known names, such as Oscar winners Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro, action film superstar Jason Statham, the late Dennis Farina and former football player Vinnie Jones. This 105-minute is as fast as it gets for a film and this is certainly not to everybody's liking (including myself). I found the camera work (i.e. the constant switches and movements) fairly distracting. The characters are all very much in your face, so Ritchie and the actors definitely wanted to make sure you remember them. But how about writing them properly instead? Giving them interesting background stories and making them memorable this (much more subtle) way? Now that would be something, wouldn't it? And that also certainly requires much more skill when it comes to writing screenplays compared to just letting everybody shout at each other for the entire film, even if the path Ritchie took at least resulted in a handful fairly memorable quotes.<br/><br/>In the heart of a story there is a precious (priceless actually) diamond most of the characters are after. And with characters, I could also say criminals as absolutely everybody in here has gotten his hands dirty one way or another. This includes all kinds of robberies, brawls, illegal fighting, blackmailing and even murder. The latter also includes the scene I found the funniest. (Actually I did not find too many scenes funny in here I have to admit, it mostly seemed pretty try-hard to me.) I am talking about a scene where one guy shoots another and the guy hit by the bullet keeps insulting the guy who shot at him. And this goes on and on. Another bullet, another insult, another shot, another insult etc. He just didn't want to die it seems and told him frankly and openly what he thought of him. This scene was laugh-out-loud hilarious. But it was really the only one and there aren't too many entertaining sequences in here. Still, comedy was probably the film's biggest strength as storytelling and character development were really weak in my opinion. Ritchie had a fairly decent cast here and I found it pretty underwhelming what he made of it. This film is actually among the IMDb top250 films and this is truly baffling as this film does not have any substance (besides drugs) or depth whatsoever. I guess this film has many fanboys rooting for it (I believe it actually is a very male-oriented film with the cast and story) and these do not care about all the important aspects I already mentioned that this film lacks. I personally give it a thumbs-down. Not recommended."

"michaelf","2","25","69","24 January 2001"," The Worst Movie of 2000?
","""Snatch"" may well be the worst movie I have seen over the past 12 months. Who ever told Guy Ritchie he can direct? Probably the same person who told him Madonna would make a good wife.<br/><br/>There are so many places where this film went wrong, I don't know where to begin. But, I'll give it a shot.<br/><br/>1. The movie is just too slow. Ritchie certainly is taking us for a wild ride, but the pace is almost as slow as an 80-year-old grandmother driving on the interstate. Ritchie spends too much time spinning his wheels before moving on.<br/><br/>2. MTV-Style cinematography. Nothing really wrong with this, provide it is actually used to further the story and the pace of the film. But Ritchie uses it as a gimmick. His lame attemps to dazzle me actually bored me.<br/><br/>3. The use of ""ethnic types"" and ""ethnic humor."" Again, I have nothing against the use of ethnic humor or the use of race, provided it is not done in a mean spirited manner. Ritchie doesn't cross the line, but he does tread it. Actually, from his portrayals I can see that Ritchie's knowledge of ethnicity is limited to whatever is white Anglo-Saxon Protestant. His use of ethnic humor makes Ritchie look like an idiot.<br/><br/>4. Eccentric characters. I love to see really eccentric characters in movies. But again, this is something Ritchie can't handle. Half his characters aren't eccentric enough, and the rest go so far off the deep end that they are not even credible, just one-dimensional. Its as if Ritchie is trying too hard. Also there is a lack of ""normal"" characters for the eccentrics to play off of.<br/><br/>The only positive thing I can say about ""Snatch"" is that this is the best acting I have ever seen from Brad Pitt. He totally disappeared into his character. Unfortunately, even with Pitt ""Snatch"" is not worth the time or money to see."

","MAJOR SPOILER<br/><br/>You know what I'm talking about, the kind of films in which people get killed and no one bats an eyelid, when did the term ""black comedy"" suddenly mean that it was alright to kill a man in you're film and laugh about it. It reminded me of a scene in The Simpsons (yes, I'm quoting the Simpsons, it's a lot more intelligent than anything Guy Ritchie can come up with), when Marge and Lisa are watching an episode of McBain, and McBain snaps a mans neck - Marge says, ""Now that's what I call breakneck speed"", to which Lisa glibly replays ""Mom, a man just died""... If only Guy Ritchie had, had a little Lisa Simpson sitting next to him whilst he wrote this script. But that's not the worst part, Ritchie does actually include a couple of very sinister murders e.g. When Mickey's (Brad Pitt) mother is burned alive, there terrible, because the rest of the film is so empty, what is Ritchie trying to do - if the intention of the film was to be light hearted then don't put in the hard stuff. Well I suppose Snatch is better than Lock Stock, which means perhaps one day Ritchie will make a decent film, and stop destroying the memory of Pulp Fiction with these lame cockney Tarantino rip-offs.<br/><br/>4/10"

","Snatch has been critically acclaimed throughout and has been praised as such a great film with an interesting take on a British crime, involving many characters. However as watching the film, there were many characters but too many where we did not care for them. The plot at times is confusing with these characters all coming together but in the end we do not really care. For a film with a running time of a little over 1 hour 40 minutes, it feels longer than one should. As an ensemble cast, not many stand out except Jason Statham (in a very early role in his career) and Brad Pitt (though not in a good way, speaking with a difficult hard to hearing accent- and wondering why he took this role). <br/><br/>Too many characters, and were not interesting, was hard to remember their names as well. What makes it worse is the constant jumping from characters and scenes. Snatch is quite the overrated film and wondering why it is currently in the IMDb top 250 with a rating of 8.3. Also praise with comedy and having humor but nothing into the film is quite at that, where the scenes feel bland and wondering as to what people found funny. Apart from some of the boxing scenes involving Brad Pitt, the scenes with Jason Statham and the last 20 minutes or so, Snatch is not a good recommend."

"tedg","Null","10","24","1 February 2001"," Style, But to What End?
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>This kind of film superficially resembles what I really yearn for: heavy cinematic qualities in the filmmaking. I look for a harmony of vision among how the camera is managed, the edits are composed, the music punctuates the image. Snatch has this, and sustains a pace almost frenetically conducted. I was really impressed with the effectiveness of style that was pulled off here.<br/><br/>But the reason I yearn for this is because of the power that can result when these cinematic skills are put to the service of climbing into one's mind. Few things are as powerful at the social level than such films. The written word goes deeper, but film is more visceral. So I have to ask in the service of what art was all this Snatch motion created? And I think in this case, the flash alone was intended to be the only justification.<br/><br/>
That's not good enough for me. This film is an interesting empty vessel. In contrast, the first Mr Madonna isn't afraid of life. We're better off with him. Less style, but more substance, the stuff our brains and nerves eat.<br/><br/>Kudos though to Brad Pitt. Even though this film is a waste for him, he is on a laudable journey to plumb many non-mainstream niches, while eluding the fate of Julia.

","The basic idea of Snatch is that a botched diamond heist leads to a wild and tangled adventure involving gangsters, boxers, and a detailed look at the London underground scene.<br/><br/>The film has many story lines that seem to weave in and out of each other so seamlessly that it gives the film a unique style. Explaining the story is a real pig but here goes - The story goes something like this - Franky Four Fingers (Benicio del Toro) arrives in London to deliver a consignment of stolen gems to Doug ""The Head"" (Mike Reid), In the capital, Franky crosses paths with a ""sneaky *beep* Russian"" Boris ""The Blade"" (Rade Serbedzija), who is planning to half-inch the prize diamond for himself while Franky is at the bookies. Unfortunately, Boris's accomplices make a pig's ear of the stick-up, and the rock ends up in the stomach of a deranged mutt.<br/><br/>Meanwhile in another plot line would-be boxing promoters Turkish (Jason Statham) and Tommy (Stephen Graham) find themselves in a ""tight spot"" with local kingpin Bricktop (Alan Ford) in a forthcoming illegal boxing match when their fighter is accidentally knocked out by Irish gypsy Mickey O'Neill (Brad Pitt). Unable to cancel the bout, the pair persuades Bricktop to allow them to enter Mickey in place of their injured man. Unfortunately, the ""pikey"" Irishman refuses to obey orders to ""go down in the fourth"", embarrassing Bricktop and his associates and losing him a few bob in the process Unafraid to use bloodshed to make his point, Bricktop exacts a terrible revenge on Mickey's family to stress the point that when he says go down in the fourth, he means it.<br/><br/>This film is amazingly more of a cockney comedy than a serious (""the getaway"" game style) London gangster plot. Vinnie Jones excels in the role of a London hard nut it's what he does best and the accomplices of the Russian are brilliantly funny and lighten the dark and gritty reality of the plot considerably A definite work of extreme style form Guy Ritchie with an urban soundtrack to match the plot, this film is a welcome follow-up to ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" which is also worth watching.

","I saw Guy Ritchie's ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and thought it was an extremely disappointing piece of '90s cinema - I specify it was made in the 1990s because it's another one of those Quentin Tarantino rip-offs that borrow his directorial trademarks - the violence punctuated by irony and dark humor, the intertwining stories, the morally dark characters who have no remorse.<br/><br/>""Snatch"" is a great deal better. Some people claim it's Guy Ritchie selling out to the American market because it stars Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro and Dennis Farina. If he's ""selling out,"" he's buying something better with the money - this is a lot more fun to watch than ""Two Smoking Barrels."" Simply put, it's directed much better. I felt like ""Barrels"" was a British TV commercial extended to full length - all style over substance. ""Snatch"" has similar style but there's more substance.<br/><br/>As for the performances... everyone is great. Del Toro opens the movie with a bank robbery - he steals a precious diamond and tries to sell it. This moves on to Jason Statham, as a boxing promoter, and his story ties into the previous one. This goes on and on and invites new characters into the mix.<br/><br/>The standout is of course Brad Pitt. When I lived in England we had Pikeys living around us and they annoyed the hell out of me. They were constantly speeding down our road and stealing stuff. Once they smashed their van through a neighbor's fence, then fled the scene of the accident - as if the police wouldn't figure out who it was.<br/><br/>Watching ""Snatch"" I was reminded of this and thought it was particularly memorable because I've never seen a ""Pikey"" in a movie before. Brad Pitt basically mumbles his way through the movie and he and his pack really do come across as genuine Pikeys.<br/><br/>I hate to sound like a typical American when I say ""Snatch"" is better than ""Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels,"" but I honestly think the plot, the direction and the acting is superior here. Statham is still great and Pitt is surprisingly effective in his role. The movie is lively and fun to watch, cleverly scripted with good dialogue and although some scenes are reminiscent of Tarantino, the overall product is far better than anything else Ritchie has done - and provides more originality than his other movies, too."

","SPOILERS:: I cannot discuss my reaction to ""Snatch"" (which I suppose relates to the ""snatching"" of the large diamond) without commenting on the Imdb ratings. Currently it is #142 with a rating of 8.1, primarily by virtue of most voters being under 29, and I suspect most under 21. Among the ""over 30"" crowd, the rating is 7.5, which seems to me just about right. In many respects it deserves highest ratings for style, action, witty dialog. But the story, which is a bit convoluted and which involves all bad guys, as in ""Lock, Stock..."", is a rather poor one. As one professional reviewer said, ""Guy Ritchie doesn't really want us to care about the story, it's all about the action.""<br/><br/>My main interest in seeing the movie was Brad Pitt. From the trailers, I was intrigued by his gypsy character, a bare-fist fighting champion who only needs one punch.  I think his performance is the highlight of the entire film, and again Pitt shows, as he did in ""Fight Club"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"", that he is one of the better and more versatile males actors.<br/><br/>
James Barardinelli and Roger Ebert have excellent summaries of the film. For highlights, I really thought the dog swallowing the squeek toy, and ""squeek-barking"" was funny, as was ""Something to declare? Yes, don't go to England."" Much of the dark humor in ""Snatch"" arises from the ineptitude of the various crooks. If they were serious, competent crooks, then the film would not be very interesting. ""Slapstick Crooks"" would be a better name.<br/><br/>The camerawork and editing, as well as the dynamic 5-channel sound, were all first-rate. Ritchie is certainly in a different league there. I will keep watching his films for their entertainment value, but it would be easy to criticize him for all the violence, a la ""Pulp Fiction"", and pervasive use of foul language.  We just have to remind ourselves, ""It's only a movie."""

I wasn't really sure what to expect at first, but it soon became clear that it was a fantastic film.<br/><br/>The blackmail, the mindless violence, and of course, the cockney slang all made this movie a classic London gangster case. I thought that the camera shots all added to the live effect and made it all the more real.<br/><br/>The storyline was fantastic, twisting and turning throughout the whole time. It never once bored me, and all the characters acted to the best the of their abilities, including the star of the show, Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anyone who likes London gangster flicks. You will not be let down."

","Watching this (often) fast paced movie, I got too much the impression that acting was being overshadowed by all these prominent smart-cuts, transitions from one scene to the next.  The only real joy to watch (acting-wise) was Brad Pitt, playing the gypsy boxer.  Benicio del Toro was a big disappointment as a leading cast for his mere cameo appearance, and a lousy one at that.<br/><br/>Calling this movie innovative or ""highly original"" is giving way too little credit to earlier movies like Lola Rennt."

"orshansj","10","2","3","25 February 2020"," Loved it
","I find it quite interesting how most critics poo pooed this movie while almost three quarters of a million people gave it a stellar 8.3 star rating.<br/><br/>Now, what does it mean? Are people so superficial that they would like any kind of schlock? Or are the critics simply fully of it?<br/><br/>You make the judgement. One of the critics said that Guy Ritchie was lacking talent, just like his wife. Seriously? Madonna has no talent? You may not be a fan but to say that she has no talent is just stupid. How about Michael Jackson or Prince? No talent either? Another critic said Sean Penn's movie are better then Guy Ritchie's. Well, that's like saying, I don't like strawberries but I like to drive fast cars. Ever hear of such thing as apples and oranges?<br/><br/>I guess my judgement has been rendered on clueless people who dismissed this movie.<br/><br/>Regarding the movie itself. It's one of my favorites. Guy Ritchie has his own style, like Quentin Tarantino or Wes Andersen or Jim Jarmusch. Granted, he is not exactly in the same league as those three, but his movies are fast paced, fun, quotable, and Snatch is my favorites. I loved everything about it. its quirkiness, and its funky characters, and its interesting story and the whole plethora of accents (love that word, plethora).<br/><br/>My advice to people who haven't seen Snatch. Ignore the critics. Give it a try. You might discover that you love it just as much as I do. Worst case scenario, you might learn the meaning of the word ""nemesis""."
"asphyxion_","9","2","3","5 February 2020"," The 'professional' critics have NO clue ... Snatch is one of the Crime genre's greatest films ever produced
","The 55 metacritic score is an affront to the truth: Snatch is cinematic greatness, and it deserves a spot on the top shelf of any individual who considered themselves to be a genuine cinephile.<br/><br/>The editing and camera work really elevate Snatch above Richie's other popular comedy-crime movies like Lock, Stock and Rocknrolla. But it's also the satirical spirit of Snatch that propels the narrative along at a pace and execution that turns the typical 'diamond-heist-gone-fubar' story into an unforgettable 100 minute black-comedy dive into London's criminal underworld.<br/><br/>The intersecting story lines and screwball characters in serious situations gives Snatch an almost Tarantonian quality to the whole thing. Every character is memorable, from Pitt's indecipherable Mickey the Pikey lead down to the Gypsy dog who swallowed his chew toy whole and squeaks constantly when barking. Of particular note is Brick Top, who does a fantastic job at being a greasy, mean, nasty villainous S.O.B. that enjoys chopping up and feeding his competition to his pig farm swine--he makes it easy to hate him, and he does it perfectly.<br/><br/>Snatch is one of the most rewatchable movies around. I've seen it a good 70 or so times since I bought it on DVD nearly 2 decades ago.<br/><br/>If you like Tarantino movies, enjoyed Lock, Stock, or dig british/foreign crime film in general, you're going to be charmed by Guy Ritchie's masterpiece. See it now, if you haven't already."

","Absolutely great! A Masterpiece all this thing's are lesss to describe such a great movie"
"seymourblack-1","8","2","3","31 January 2018"," Lots of Laughs, Violence & Snappy Dialogue
","After a Jewish gangster steals an 86-carat diamond from a jewellery exchange in Antwerp and returns to London, a whole variety of criminals suddenly decide that they want to get their hands on the precious stone and will stop at nothing to get what they want. This sets off the crazy chain of events that provides ""Snatch"" with its highly complicated plot that unfolds at high speed and delivers lots of laughs, snappy dialogue and copious amounts of violence. Its large cast of eccentric characters adds plenty of colour and profanity and the whole piece is so well-written and narrated that any conversational exposition is kept to an absolute minimum.<br/><br/>When gambling addict Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro), who'd carried out the heist in Antwerp returns to London and decides that he wants to buy a gun, one of his gang members, who happens to be related to an ex-KGB agent called Boris the Blade (Rade Sherbedgia), puts Franky in touch with his relative who's also a gun dealer. The diamond heist had been masterminded by a shady New York businessman known as Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina) and Franky had been instructed to deliver the diamond to Avi's London associate, Doug the Head (Mike Reid). Knowing this, Boris realizes that he must relieve Franky of the diamond before it can be passed to Doug.<br/><br/>Unlicensed boxing promoter Turkish (Jason Statham) arranges for one of his fighters to take part in a match that he's set up with fellow promoter and notorious crime boss Brick Top (Alan Ford) but when his fighter can't compete after being injured in a confrontation with an Irish gypsy called Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), Turkish needs a replacement and the gypsy is the obvious choice. After striking a deal with Mickey and receiving instructions from Brick Top for the gypsy to take a dive in the forth round, the fight goes ahead but doesn't end as planned.<br/><br/>Boris the Blade acquires a gun for Franky and offers to waive any payment for it on condition that Franky places a bet for him on a boxing match. Franky agrees to do this at a bookie's that's owned by Brick Top and Boris hires a gang of grossly incompetent criminals to steal the diamond which Franky keeps in a briefcase that's handcuffed to his wrist. Brick Top is not amused by what transpires at his betting shop and in order to save their skins, the gang that Boris hired also go in search of the diamond so that they can steal it for Brick Top. On hearing that Franky had gone missing, Cousin Avi immediately comes to London and he and Doug recruit Bullet Tooth (Vinnie Jones) to use his persuasive powers to locate Franky.<br/><br/>Brick Top is a particularly vicious piece of work who imposes his will on other people by the use of threats and extreme violence but when he makes an enemy of Mickey, he completely underestimates the reaction of his adversary and the gypsy community and in so doing, makes the biggest mistake of his life.<br/><br/>""Snatch"" is a lot of fun and although the influence of Quentin Tarantino is never far away, it's most noticeable during the diamond heist when the thieves indulge in an extended discussion about the consequences of a mistake made by the Septuagint scholars who incorrectly translated the Hebrew word for ""young woman"" into the Greek word for ""virgin"". Other examples follow when Brick Top gives an extended explanation of the meaning of the word ""nemesis"" and a full description of how effectively pigs can be used to dispose of dead bodies.<br/><br/>The whole production is highly stylized and this brilliantly facilitates all the wackiness that's perpetrated by its large-than-life characters who are brought to life in a whole series of crazy, over-the-top performances. Rade Sherbedgia's eccentric facial contortions are a marvellous manifestation of Boris' lunacy, Dennis Farina's constant state of panic highlights Cousin Avi's extreme level of anxiety and Brad Pitt, with a strange hybrid accent that no-one can understand, is absolutely hilarious as the fighter whose actions are so spontaneous that even he doesn't seem to know what he might do next.<br/><br/>With its frenetic pace, fast editing and colourful characters, ""Snatch"" is exceptionally energetic, action-packed and so full of humour that watching it becomes a breathless but also tremendously entertaining experience."

","In the gutter and looking down,that's ""Snatch"".Obviously its extremely violent,foul-mouthed and aimed at blokes under 30 who think Mr Vinnie Jones is the mutt's nuts.Cheap laughs,racism - ""I hate fxxxxx pikeys"" is a constant refrain - abound and the movie continues to demonstrate the director's peculiar sycophancy to the South London demi - monde. One day those Frankie Fraser wannabees are going to get fed up with being portrayed as beetle-browed psychopaths without the wit to stay out of the nick long enough to sit through 15 three minute rounds. Here Mr Ritchie has trawled through the pages of ""Rent an 'ard bastard"" and come up with a ""comic"" cast whose idea of doing comedy is to read their lines like Morecambe and Wise,almost nodding and winking at the audience to let them in on the gag. The worst offender is the aforementioned Mr Jones who,regretfully, displays all the signs of a man who has come to believe his own publicity. The bareknuckle boxing plot has Irish Traveller Mr Brad Pitt outsmarting the crafty cockneys at their own game - not perhaps the most challenging of tasks - and the saga of the big.big,big,big diamond is more than a little reminiscent of Stanley Kramer's early sixties masterpiece but instead of under the Big Dubbleya,the treasure ends up inside a traveller's dog. Best viewed as a twenty - something bloke with a bunch of other twenty - something blokes,belching,breaking wind and necking the Stella as if there was no tomorrow. If that is not your thing I can honestly advise you to give it a wide berth."

""Pulp Fiction"" was OK, but not nearly as enjoyable to me as was ""Snatch"".<br/><br/>DEFINATELY one to watch, and watch it closely!<br/><br/>Overall, I rated this film a 8 of 10, which I always do before reading other comments or seeing the posted rating.<br/><br/>-Hyyr"

","This is great. Not since ""Pulp Fiction"" have we seen better interweaving of plots. The accents _are_ somewhat confusing at times, but I believe this is done on purpose (really, would Mickey be as charming if you knew what was going on?). The theme music is nice, and the profanity - though used quite often - is not used in a way that can be found absolutely offensive. It's more casual swearing of everyday language than it is somebody trying to shock somebody else with their language.<br/><br/>All in all, I applaud Guy Ritchie for his brilliance."

","This movie is about a few small-time crooks who get involved with a few big-time crooks. The reasons are a boxer, a gypsy boxer, and a very big diamond. <br/><br/>All through the movie, I sympathized with the small guys who kept ending up in worse and worse situations. Like having two big guys force you to do two opposite thingss... you always wonder how on earth they're going to get out of the mess. <br/><br/>It is a rather violent movie, like its predecessor from the same author: ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"". But the violence is never glorified nor dramatized. It just happens that people die when bullets hit them. And bullets happen to be fired by violent people in a violent world. <br/><br/>The style of story telling is like ""Lock Stock..."": rhapsodic. Short cuts, sometimes back in time, sometimes forward. Two second-long cuts can be enough to give a very good impression of what is happening. <br/><br/>What really brings the humour out is the understated british style. With an american accent and attitude, this movie would have been a disaster. <br/><br/>All in all, a very enjoyable movie. Even my girlfriend liked it, despite some doubts at the beginning."
"RolloTomasi","9","1","1","11 August 2001"," Resist the temptation to stop watching it
","""Snatch"" spent only a brief time in the theater for those committed to actually sitting and watching films. I did see this during its short US theatrical release, having been fortunate enough to be in a larger market city on business at the time. Back then I never found time to post a review, though. Now it's on DVD and I took another look. Same movie, smaller screen, just as good. I predict ""Snatch"" will be one of the most rented but least watched' home videos of the year because its plot is so incomprehensible (though not near as much as Guy Ritchie's previous, ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels""). People will give up on it after a time and go get a sandwich, iron clothes, play cards, etcetera. But it's fun enough to keep on as background static just for say, the bits with the dog who eats the squeaky toy and Brad Pitt's hilarious, unintelligible Irish(?) accent.<br/><br/>
Just a few words about Brad Pitt: he's quickly becoming one of my favorite actors, mostly because of how he completely commits to every role he's in. He has a healthy, George Clooney-like mentality toward his choice of projects (like George, he's chosen a Coen brothers production, ""To The White Sea"" for his next), saying pooey! to the Hollywood hit machine and choosing roles that are actually interesting. Occasionally he'll earn a paycheck with dreck such as ""Meet Joe Black."" In this film he plays Mickey, a gypsy (or to your average Welshman, ""piker"") with an iron jaw and a monster right hook.<br/><br/>
Pitt plays Mickey with such genius. See, when you need to understand him, you can. When it's just for laughs, well, you'd need subtitles. The accent (I could be wrong on this), like the lazy eye in `Twelve Monkeys,' was his idea and is intended to poke fun at the way American audiences couldn't understand a word anyone was saying in ""Smoking Barrels."" Pitt's every move is calculated, but he does it with such abandon you have to give him credit.<br/><br/>Grade for `Snatch': A-"

With excellent performances by Vinnie jones as Bullet Tooth Tony, Brad Pitt as boxer one punch mickey, Mike reid as an Jewish diamond dealer, Jason Staham as the main hero,Turkish, Stephen Graham as his mate,Tommy and Benicio del toro as Frankie four fingers, this is an dazzlingly scripted work which scores on all counts."

","A lot of people are going to like this film for a lot of different and overlapping reasons, which is a dandy recommendation for any film.  Then again, a lot of people are going to pass on it because it seems to deviate from storytelling, which it does.  This is entertainment, like at a carnival; every corner you turn is something different but when you get ready to leave you look back and see it was all one thing.  Dark comedy, tragedy, people you don't necessarily care about but become seriously curious about.  The poetry is in the way the story is told; it plays with time but it plays with time in an ironic and thematic way.  The poetry is in the story, poetry as old as storytelling because in a nutshell it is about a really bad deed getting what it deserves, the tale just veers and twists and dances on the way to justice.  The poetry is in the visuals, in scenes that follow the plot and in scenes that own themselves, like out takes.  I'm not a huge fan of Brad Pitt's though I think he's navigating that line between good and great, but in this film he gathered me up and made me his buddy.  I just sat down with him in this and liked his character the way I like an outcast cousin.  Guy Ritchie did good.  I've heard it said that if a film has three really good scenes, then it was a success.  This film has three great scenes of irony, three great scenes of melodrama, three great scenes of humor, three great visual scenes ... don't watch this film with expectations.

","For being a post Pulp Fiction, post Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, post Usual Suspects movie, Snatch is terrific (8 out of 10). I wasn't expecting much from this latest entry in the ultra-hip/chaotic sequenced/violent-funny/tangled plot movie, but I was won over in a big way.<br/><br/>I liked all the characters in Snatch, and it didn't matter to me that they were all stereotypical bit players. Even though it had a WWF flavor to it, with the ""uber-individual"" cast of characters, it was still entertaining. I felt all the actors did a great job in bringing life and a hint of realism to each of their pigeonholed parts. Pitt in particular is terrific as the ""Pikey"" who is virtually unintelligable throughout.<br/><br/>The movie is stylish, and even though the devices have been used to death in other pictures, I felt Ritchie brought enough freshness to Snatch to make it work. And even though I saw the old ""all-points-converge-here"" plot developing within the first couple of minutes, it didn't matter much--I was entertained throughout.<br/><br/>Basically, if you've seen a bunch of movies from this Pulp Fiction genre lately, you'd be better off not watching Snatch for a while. It isn't original enough to stand out among the rest, and it will be impossible to give it the objective look it deserves. On the other hand, when viewed on its own, it is quite good, and I think worth a high standing in the cool action flick category."
"camrossmac","10","1","1","13 July 2001"," One of the best British Movies ever.
","Snatch is a superb masterpiece by Guy Richie which amazed me after my first viewing. It left me speechless. After the last 16 viewings of it, I still enjoy it as much as the first viewing as every time it amazes me. It was the first movie which I bought on DVD and it was a risk as I had never seen it before. It was proberly the best $40 I have spent all year as it has been thrashed on my DVD player. The bonus cd on the DVD has some surprise specials in it with some hidden bits in it including a lot of swearing from the movie. The movie itself is exceptional from the humour between Turkisk and Tommy to the hostility between Bricktop and anyone who gets near him. The movie includes some great one liners that I have repeated many times since such as 'You can't underestimate the predictability of stupidity' Bullit Tooth Tony. The camera shots by Guy Richie are amazing from the quick zoom onto Turkish and Tommy when Mickey drops the other boxer with one punch, and also the shot of the guns showing REPLICA and DESERT EAGLE .50.<br/><br/>I have discussed with many people what is better between Snatch and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and most people cant decide. If you have only seen one of the them you must watch the other as both are great movies and that is why I gave both 10/10."

","But, I loved Snatch!  It is a rare exception for me to like British movies. The accents make it hard to understand what the characters are saying and also, I find that British movies tend to be rather boring and tediously short on action.  Snatch is fast, frenetic, and funny.  The brief camera shots of a high strung and nervous Cousin Avi crossing the Atlantic ocean on the Concorde is just hilarious.  Comparisons to Quentin Tarantino movies are unavoidable - then again, who cares? (Oh, I know, some of the supremely jaded movie watchers who critique the movies at imdb).  In other words, these people want to see an ""epic"", each and every time they go to the movies.  I could watch movies like this hundreds of times.  Some moviegoers actually like all of the plot twists and the large ensemble cast.  Unless you are being paid to critique movies, try to relax while watching them, instead of looking for every weak part, or trying to compare this movie with that. Let each movie stand(or fall) on its own merits.  Really, what you can pay for drinks, candy, and/or popcorn is where the real critiquing should begin(and end). I took off one point because, as I stated earlier, the dialogue is hard to understand at times.  Brad Pitt being the exception, we weren't suppose to understand what the hell he was saying.  Good job Guy Ritchie, now I have to check out Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels - not for comparisons, but to hopefully enjoy another movie directed by the same person. 9/10"

If you loved Lock Stock you should not miss this movie it's all about stealin' stones (or rather one stone) and breakin' bones (and lots of 'em).

"zakirda","10","1","1","6 June 2001"," one of best comedies you'll ever see
","It is quite hard to describe in words just how good snatch is. In all honesty it is one level above. There are not many films that can match its calibre. Guy Ritche is a brilliant director and all his cast are just as brilliant. its of the best films i've seen a long time along with goodfellows, fight club, analyze this and american beauty. it will never fail to brighten your day."
"Thornstr","9","1","1","20 May 2001"," Best picture of the year
","I read several reviews of Snatch before I took the chance to see it, and many critics seemed disappointed with the fact that it is so similar to Lock, Stock... Well, I don't think that is a reason to trash this movie. It really is the best movie I've seen this year! It is even better than Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie is one of the best directors ever - I mean it! He plays a lot with the camera, and the result is more than excellent. The opening credits is among the best I've seen. One fact that strikes me is how fast-paced and full of energy the movie is. Not one second more than necessary is in here, and with this many characters and stories taking place, quite a lot takes place during the almost-two-hours.<br/><br/>The ending scenes is so beautifully shot that my heart stopped for a few minutes. Now I thought Fight Club was beautifully shot in its similar scenes, but this is even better. Brad Pitt makes his part quite good, but he shouldn't be the reason why you're seeing it. A LOT of guys could have played his role just as good.<br/><br/>Warning! I saw the movie twice in a row and absolutely loved it, but when I forced my parents and my brother to see it, they lost interest after a while and didn't finish the movie. They just didn't think it was funny. First of all, I guess this is a movie for boys. And you probably have to enjoy violence. I mean, it isn't real, it's not like I go out and kill someone after I've seen it. If you just relax and enjoy the different universe the movie creates, it will be a blast.<br/><br/>Rating 9 out of 10"

","First I wanna start off by saying this is exactly like Lock, Stock but if we ignore that which I did then we'll have a good time at this movie. This movie was very cleverly set up. The plot and the events that occur in this movie and the way they put it all together seemed very fresh and unique. This director has obvious potential but he's gotta get away from this format that he seems to have and kinda innovate and variate on his style. The movie was very fun to watch from start to finish, the characters in this movie are very interesting and the acting in it wasn't too shabby either. I feel sorry for the jewlery store owner and his friends though. Glad to see a Brad Pitt movie without Julia Roberts in it. I hate her. Not gonna bother watching the Mexican and we'll have to see about Ocean's 11. Anyways this was a very good movie and I highly recommend it. 8/10"

","After seeing and loathing Guy Ritchie's previous effort, ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" I was hardly looking forward to this, his follow up of a similar nature.  However, I was very surprised by the film, because I enjoyed it immensely.  The story was not especially original but I thought the acting talent was a huge improvement and the comedy moments a good deal funnier.  Of the actors involved I was especially impressed by Alan Ford, who was suitably intimidating as Brick Top and also Stephen Graham, who I'd never seen before but I'm sure I'll be seeing him elsewhere in the future. Best of all, however, is Dennis Farina whom I found hilarious in the role of Cousin Avi and felt he lit up every scene he was in.  Of course, the traces of the ""Lock Stock"" bad acting regime was still there, with Jason Statham just appallingly bad as Turkish.  I shudder in recollection of it.  Vinnie Jones just plays himself as usual but I'll admit he has improved slightly since ""Lock Stock"".  Who knows, ten films down the line, he might border on competent.<br/><br/>I recommend the film to anyone, even if they hated ""Lock Stock"" as I did. It aint perfect but it's an enjoyable film all the same, if you can put up with the tiresome, self-indulgent camera tricks that Ritchie uses throughout."

The film has some fantastic edge to it with strong performances from Alan Ford, Vinnie Jones (wow), and of course Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>The first 40 minutes of this film is so overwhelmingly fast-paced, you rarely get a break from laughing.

The dialogue is cliched mockney rubbish, the plot borrows totally from every other british crime pic of the last 50 years, the whole thing is just embarrassingly awful. In fact, the only good thing is Brad Pitt's performance as an Irish gypsy. Guy Ritchie should really stop pretending to be an east-end gangster and turn his talents towards something less annoying."

Not a joke in the ha ha sense but in the sense that you wish you had more than popcorn to throw at the screen.<br/><br/>The main problem with this picture is that it is trying to be something which it is not. A - it tries t be humorous B - it tries to be original and C - it tries to be that great white elephant, cool. Possibly if one hadn't seen Lock Stock... this would have passed the time with a slight modicum of enjoyment. But no, we get a rehashed, regurgitated, reject. The witty raconteur between characters in the ""Bleedin' barrel o' cockney monkeys"" (to quote the Fast Show) style becomes irksome and boring after about five minutes. The characters we have shoved in our faces have all the grace and subtlety of a deranged mongoose<br/><br/>But my main bugbear is the direction. It can only be described as 'CRASH' cinematography. I'll try and explain. 1) Cut from previous scene. 2) Loud music with heavy beat. 3) Man/ woman walking. 4) Said man/ woman stops walking. 5) Said man/ woman says something witty to other character. 6) Other character retorts with something equally witty. 7) Cut to next scene and repeat.<br/><br/>When I watch wrestling I may enjoy this style, but I would rather wrestle a bear with an eating disorder than watch this drivel again."
"Gaston Vanbaal","2","9","25","3 January 2001"," ""Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels"" Revisited
","In 1998, when ""Lock, Stock..."" came out, Ritchie was relatively unknown, and that was part of the charm of the movie.  The comedy was refreshing, evenso with visual effects and story teller tricks;  the great surprise was the ""everyone""-finale.  The movie was an alternative and commercial hit, which is not an everyday achievement.  The conception of ""Snatch"", however, cannot be driven by anything different from commercialism: it is an exact copy of ""Lock, Stock...""; Ritchie didn't even try to hide it.  Plot, characters and effects are exactly alike - to give an example, the only change made to Vinnie Jones' character in ""Lock, Stock..."" is the name.  What makes it even worse, is that Ritchie needs visually not entertaining features (stills, name-tags, arrows) to tell his story.  Two highlights, however, are the performances of Alan Ford and Mike Reid: as evil as can be, and therefore entertaining."
"beedebee","1","16","53","18 September 2001"," too smart for its own sake
","Same as with Lock, Stock and whatever, really. Guy Ritchie, an o.k. director at best, should pick a decent screenwriter for his next project to tone things down a bit. Way too many crossing story-lines, OTT characters and each and every line has to be smart and smug but strangely none of them are genuinely funny or clever, in short OVERKILL. Being rude and spouting profanities doesn't make it funny in itself, although Roy 'Chubby' Brown would disagree on that one.<br/><br/>The British think they have a Tarantino on their hands, but that just proves a cliche about the British and their tendency of overrating themselves.<br/><br/>Horrible stuff, watch Pulp Fiction instead."

","Let me preface this by saying that I very much dislike Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. (If you liked that, you'll probably like this.) I say the same thing for this new piece of drivel by Ritchie. Why? How could I dislike such a riveting piece of modern cinema by such a visionary young director? Oh, come on.... There isn't that much to like here. The style is more of the same - stealing, as I've said before, from the likes of Trainspotting and Tarantino (with Scorsese added in here for good measure?). This is not creative stuff. He takes what they've done and churns out a completely shallow, worthless rendition of it, creating what so many people in this post-Tarantino era do: this brand of ""hip,"" violent cinema, with the aloof, jaded humor about the whole thing. What is lacking is any sort of redemptive value at all; there is no depth, no character (people seem to love the characters in this; they're all more of character sketches, of violent criminals at that), and really there is little here that could be called a human emotion. If not substance, then what? The humor is generally lacking and low brow, attempting to get laughs off the most base, disgusting things. The entire content of this film is like staring into a toilet really... Don't misunderstand me. I'm really not just a huge prude - afterall, I like the aforementioned film and directors. I simply feel that there should be something in all of this nonsense which makes it worth my while. There isn't... This is empty virtuosity (where it is even that). Unlike someone like Scorsese, Ritchie will make us bask in filth with no payback; instead, it may glorify it and is rather like watching a kid play with a new toy."

Brad Pitt was funny, though."

Yes, Brad Pitt's Irish boxer is great but it's the only highlight in an otherwise dire film. I'm ashamed that an Englishman could come up with this kind of tripe."
"Metacognizant","2","7","19","28 January 2013"," Funny, but not funny enough to illegitimize its violence.
","An atrocious comedic drama which glamorizes criminal activity, violence, and almost mind-numbingly pervasive profanityI had a hard time finishing it. Rest assured that your potential for gaining new insight or finding life-enriching meaning of any kind is slim to none; you definitely will not be uplifted. Even just measuring it in terms of simple entertainment value, its wit & humor don't come close to compensating for its violence. The kinds of flashy bloodshed and theatrical cruelty which are found in films like Snatch desensitize fragile minds and corrode morals in a way that, yes, does in fact facilitate real-world violence.<br/><br/>Brief example: the film's analysis of the efficiencies of pig farms for human corpse disposal - some people inevitably walked away reflecting on the strengths & weaknesses of different corpse disposal methodsa topic in which they would not have otherwise invested mental energy. I just wish we could have more honest conversations with ourselves and each other about the impact the media to which we expose ourselves has on us individually, and on those among us who are most malleable. Not to be preachy, but that there is any real market for this movie ought to be unsettling to those of us who value human life; this film almost entirely implies that it is worthless. Watch something elsethere is plenty of better out there to be seen."
"kanika2505","6","4","9","24 September 2018"," An over-rated movie..
","When I saw the ratings and reviews of the movie, I was really excited to watch it but unfortunately I was a little disappointed. Probably, high level of expectations took this movie down for me.

The quest for the stone, however was somewhat interesting. Overall, an average movie."

","Let's reconstruct a scene from Quentin Tarantino's highly successful ""Pulp Fiction (1994)."" Samuel L, Jackson and John Travolta are two hit men assigned to wipe out a couple of welshers. In the apartment they shoot two of the kids to death and turn to leave, when a third terrified kid rushes out of the bathroom and empties his pistol at their backs. Jackson and Travolta turn and look at the six bullet holes in the wall behind them -- every shot having missed -- glance quizzically at each other, then wordlessly raise their guns and blow the brains out of the third guy.<br/><br/>Now, if that scene was funny, this whole movie is hilarious. It's vastly more stylized, with abundant slow motion, instantaneous cuts, stings on the sound track, and occasional subtitle, as well as a narration by Jason Statham. <br/><br/>But, as in ""Pulp Fiction,"" there are multiple narrative threads involving three black thieves, a mock-Jewish conspiracy, a Russian, corrupt boxing matches, and something about a priceless diamond as big as a ping pong ball. For lagniappe, in addition to Quentin Tarantino in excess, we get touches -- or snatches, if you prefer -- of Charlie Chaplin's slapstick, mostly involving a cute sassy mutt with a black patch over one eye. The dog gulps down a squeaky rubber toy and thereafter when barking he also squeaks. Sometimes he only squeaks. Later, after the dog swallows the diamond, the head villain orders him ""opened up"" but the .50 caliber pistol bearing goon who has killed dozens of men is reluctant to shoot the dog.<br/><br/>It's full of wisecracks, F-bombs, fast cuts, action, and assorted mishigas, all of which manage to subsume the plot with less difficulty than the dog had swallowing the squeaky rubber toy. <br/><br/>The only time I cared about what happened to any of the characters was when the heavies burned Brad Pitt's Mum alive in the caravan -- a dirty trick if you ask me. It may be that Pitt gives the best performance in the sense that, though I could understand only about one word out of five from the normal characters, I could understand nothing at all said by Pitt's Irish tinker. ""Waw may"" is actually ""Why me?"""

"phubbs","6","3","6","30 July 2015"," Snatch
","'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels 2' could be its real name, Ritchie is back with the second in his British gangster trilogy ('Revolver' being number three) and this time due to the success of his first venture he clearly has more money to play with so he brings in some big name stars.<br/><br/>The film is almost the same kind of thing to 'Lock Stock' being another gritty, dirty, slimy cockney collaboration of tales all revolving around yet more oddball wheeler dealers, thugs and gangsters as they all try to get ahold of money, jewels and each other in (again) a Tarantino type way with more gallows humour. The cast again is fantastic and includes yet more British actors that were somehow left out of the first film, over Ritchie's films he's used every known British character actor or soap star we have. The inclusion of some big Hollywood stars actually, for me, brings the film down slightly, they don't seem realistic and can't fit into this exclusively British world thus the film loses its sense of realism, a big Hollywood star doesn't always equal a good direction to go.<br/><br/>To be frank the film does really have a R. Rodriguez feel to it eg. 'Mariachi' was made, it did well so RR remade it bigger and better. 'Snatch' does seem to fall into that category to a degree, it does feel almost like a reboot or upgrade of 'Lock Stock' as some of the cast that do show up in both films are playing the same kind of role, mainly Vinnie Jones who can't really play anything else. The film has the exact same grotty feel to it with your typical South/East London looking pubs, alleys and streets, more cockney dialect to confuse any non-Londoner, more hints at vicious violence but without actually showing that much, some glorious fights and more swearing than you can possibly imagine.<br/><br/>The only thing I don't like about the film is all the silly names everyone has, I just get the feeling Ritchie was trying too hard to make it in the same vain as American New York gangsters, your typical hood with his catchy nickname like Billy the rat or pool table Pauly for example, it just seemed a bit daft. Basically this is another triumph for Ritchie despite making the same film all over again. Alan Fords portrayal of Brick Top is also probably the most chilling baddie I've seen in years.<br/><br/>Oi!!! geeeza!!<br/><br/>6/10"

","After watching lock stock and two smoking barrels and then snatch it feels like completely different. Unlike its predecessor this ones a bit more funny but also more serious. Still i want to highlight a view things in my review regarding my first watch of the movie (with several pausing and rewind of course); So far I'm still thinking how the hell this Guy Ritchie's mind function. I mean where does he start writing the story from. Its just so brilliant that i still think this is the best crime comedy ever. Though Del Tor0 only plays big in the beginning and i kind of disappointed in that, i think Pitt has done really well, so is all other actors with big role in this movie and even Del Tor0 himself. Most of the words spoken make me laugh all the way through the movie. Its just seem unbelievable the writing is.Anyway, check this bottom one out.<br/><br/>Apart from all its positivity i found this movie quite confusing not for the subtitles i was using or anything but for the lack of its writing. Apparently i found myself confused with day and night as the notorious brick top state there will be another rematch for mickey in the next couple of days. but that happens only the next day. The part involving Vinnie, Sol and Tyrone though, is somehow slow. Picture this, somebody just got killed in your house, whom in this movie is the whatever four fingers guy Del Toro play, then you wait for the next day to move the guy from your guest room, which isn't even locked in the noontime. It makes a lot more sense if this Boris the blade guy see them in the afternoon, rather than night as is shown. And as for himself, i found himself quite flashing as he returned home after got hit by a car then in an instant return to the pub which is perhaps a block away while Bullet Tooth Tony just got away from the telephone. I mean, look at this, his car meets with Jason Stat's car somewhere on the road but when Jason reach Boris building he returned ON FOOT with a speed as striking as the light. Haven't yet spell that Jason's car was facing the wrong direction.<br/><br/>Apart from the brilliant opening scene which stun me in front of the screen (i was planning to just test whether the video recorder worked) for the rest of the time, the ending is somewhat flawed, i mean what do the two black guys waiting for to bury those corpses in the noon light. Though i must say i forbid Ritchie as even the last scene when Jason Stat car pass by their place and the dog looking from the LEFT window is angularly correct, and so is the map of the location that i picture during the view. Still i think it lacks on the writing as it needs to be revised. But out of all the editing, directing and all is formidable, overall this is a pretty enjoyable movie as it is funny and seriously great, of course the twists brilliant too."
"zardoz-13","10","3","6","28 March 2008"," British Crime Goes From Rags to Ritchie's ""Snatch""
","Although they don't produce as many gangster movies as we Americans, the British know how to make some proper, first-rate, sure-fire crime thrillers. Movies such as ""The Lavender Hill Mob"" (1951), ""The League of Gentlemen"" (1960), ""Robbery"" (1967), ""The Italian Job"" (1969), ""Get Carter"" (1971), ""Sitting Target"" (1972), ""McVicar"" (1980), ""The Long Good Friday"" (1981), ""Buster"" (1988), and ""The Krays"" (1990) exemplify the upper tier of British crime cinema.<br/><br/>This sub-genre of crime movies has not been tampered with until recently when an unknown helmer of rock videos and commercials made his first feature in 1995 called ""Hard Case."" Since then he has crafted the two of the best British crime thrillers in years and rekindled interest in the sub-genre with imitators mimicking his work. Were it not for his marriage to music diva Madonna, we'd probably not be sampling his latest effort in the theaters but waiting for it to appear on the video rental shelves. Guy Ritchie is his name, and Ritchie is rapidly becoming the Francis Ford Coppola of mobster movies in English. (Unfortunately, Ritchie's latest endeavor ""Revolver"" didn't fare well enough in its theatrical run or with the critics to follow up his previous hits.) Ritchie, who helmed the downright gritty, raucously violent, but thoroughly entertaining gangster epic ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels,"" pounds the mean streets of London once again with his quirky crime comedy ""Snatch."" Starring Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro, Rade Sherbedzija, Vinnie Jones, and Dennis Farina, this splendidly-lensed, ballistically-edited, multi-plotted British mobster saga boasts elements of Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction,"" Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas,"" David Fincher's ""Fight Club,"" George Roy Hill's ""The Sting,"" and Warren Beatty's ""Dick Tracy."" While ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" detailed the theft of two antique shotguns and the myriad hands through which the guns passed along with a rigged high stakes poker game, ""Snatch"" chronicles a diamond heist and the thuggish throng out to nab it as well as unlicensed underground boxing matches. Indeed, while both movies appear roughly similar in plot convolutions and revelations, even sharing cast members Jason Statham and Vinnie Jones, ""Snatch"" surpasses ""LS&TSB"" with its ""Sting"" ending. People that don't like Brad Pitt but enjoyed ""Fight Club"" will find ""Snatch"" just as rewarding a movie, too. Like ""LS&TSB,"" the real star of ""Snatch"" is writer & director Guy Ritchie. He blends comedy and crime without compromising on morality. Bad people pay the piper in this movie, and the consequences of crime are never given the short shrift. Nevertheless, Ritchie has the gift of conjuring comedy in the most unsavory situations. Whether he shows us a dog that chomps a squeaky toy and squeaks afterward with every breath it draws or a fat getaway car driver that can barely squeeze into and out of a small automobile, Ritchie knows how to tweak the formula at the appropriate time and place.<br/><br/>""Snatch"" opens with our reluctant hero, Turkish (Jason Statham), narrating his tale of woe about how his partner Tommy (Stephen Graham) and he have mired themselves in the mother of all messes. Everything starts when Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) and his gang hold up an Antwerp jeweler and steal an 84-carat stone for his boss, Avi (Dennis Farina of ""Get Shorty""), who is sweating it out back in New York City. Franky lays over in London, meets Russian racketeer Boris the Blade (Rade Sherbedzija) who supplies him with a gun free of charge if Franky will place an illegal boxing bet for him. Eventually, an alarmed Avi freaks out when Franky doesn't show up. Avi contacts his jeweler cousin, Dog the Head (Mike Reid), about Franky's gambling addiction and jumps on a jet for England. Meanwhile, Boris hires two inept black pawnshop dealers, Vinny (Robbie Gee) and Sol (Lennie James), to mug Franky and rip-off the rock. Their botched attempt at sticking up a bookie's secret betting joint will have you slapping your knees and laughing out loud. They wind up kidnapping Franky because they cannot break the chain on the attaché case cuffed to his wrist. The action shifts gears back to Turkish. He dispatches Tommy to buy a caravan to replace the dilapidated trailer that serves as headquarters for his boxing enterprises. Poor Tommy gets taken for everything by a band of Irish gypsies led by Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt of ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"") who decks Turkish's new boxing champ, Gorgeous George (Adam Fogerty), with one devastating right hook when he challenges Mickey.<br/><br/>""Snatch"" whirls giddily around in so many circles that you almost get dizzy keeping up with its characters that randomly pop in and out of the action. Turkish and Tommy find themselves in deep trouble now because they cut a deal with a crooked boxing promoter, Brick Top (Alan Ford, looking like a maniacal Austin Powers), to have George take a dive in the upcoming fight. Mickey agrees to replace Gorgeous, but George refuses to throw the fight. Anybody that double-crosses ruthless Brick Top can count on not only suffering a horrible death but having their hack-up remains vanish into the feed troughs at Brick Top's man-eating swine farm. Brick Top outlines a frightening but funny scenario about how to dispose of corpses at pig farms, explaining at one point that ""a pig can go through bones like butter."" The dialogue here is not nearly as incomprehensible as it was in ""LS&TSB,"" except for Pitt's babbling character. The performances are uniformly excellent, with Farina scoring well as the best of the bunch as the New York diamond fence. Before this hilariously funny, extremely-profane, fast-paced fracas fades out, the dexterous Ritchie has ushered audiences on another surprise-laden, whirlwind excursion through an underworld as loony as it is lethal. ""Snatch"" is a top-notch comic caper worth catching."

It had that hard edged comedy that Pulp Fiction seemingly invented. As a matter of fact, except for Fight Club, this may be the best movie that has come out since Pulp Fiction. This should definitely be up for an oscar, and Brad Pitt for best supporting actor. You can't understand a word he says but he still manages to say more than most actors do in a 5 minute monologue. Another highlight was Benicio Del Toro who, while not in the film for very long, steals every scene he's in.

Both ""Lock Stock...' and 'Snatch' are Tarantino rip offs and the only reason this is not obvious to everyone is because the movies are made in Britain.<br/><br/>In fact Ritchie is so inspired by Tarantino that I am not sure whether the Madonna references are there because of him being married to her, or because of the 'Reservoir Dogs' Madonna intro.<br/><br/>'Snatch' is better than ""Lock Stock'. Ritchie's rhythm has improved, but he still is no Tarantino and the semi American cast helps a lot. Also the humor is great at times, maybe at larger doses than expected, which makes 'Snatch' a comedy more than anything else.<br/><br/>By the way, has anyone noticed that in Guy Ritchie's movies everybody pronounces 'TH' as 'F'?

","Guy Ritchie's debut ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" was a refreshing, lean, original, and very funny British mixture of Action Comedies/Gambling Dramas/Crime Thrillers. ""Lock, Stock.."" also introduced Jason Statham with whom Ritchie went on to making two more films and Vinnie Jones, a football player turned an actor. Ritchie's next movie, Snatch, was my introduction to his work. It is simply marvelous and my favorite. It uses the same broken narrative as Lock and Stock, intertwines numerous plot threads which intersect and play off each other, and follows the characters who are over-the-top deliciously evil, marvelously clueless and always funny. The plot revolves around a stolen diamond as huge as these historic celebrated stones you might have seen on display in the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom in London Tower or Washington Museum of Natural History or in The State Diamond Fund of Moscow Kremlin. No wonder that every character in Snatch tries to get it. Among them, low-levels gangsters of all sorts of mafia, including Jewish, Russian, and London based. Add to the mix the Irish Gypsies ""who can't be trusted"" because whatever they say could not be understood even by the native English speakers. Don't forget a sadistic crime boss who keeps huge pet pigs with very specific diet. And then there is a dog that likes to snatch and swallow things. All sorts of things.<br/><br/>I can watch Snatch from any scene and I would not switch the channel on it. I think it is the best Ritchie's film. It is so perfect in its nastiness. It does not preach anything; it does not have deep message or any other purpose than to entertain and entertain it does. I've seen it so many times that I happily expect the familiar hilarious quotes or scenes or exchanges between the characters which are the best part of the movie. I pay attention to the soundtrack and to Ritchie's style that is known for frequent fast cuts and quick edits. The same technique was also successfully used in his Rocknrolla in one of the most hilarious sex scene I've ever seen. Ritchie likes to return to the same point in time several times to tell the story (or to show it) from the different points of view. The scenes of violence, sometimes grotesque, have been staged and choreographed so well that you can't help admiring them and smile while watching. I enjoy acting by everyone and I believe that the famous (and not so famous but very talented) actors had as much fun playing their outrageous characters as I did following them on the dark and gloomy streets of London underworld.<br/><br/>Snatch is enormously enjoyable -on one condition though. You have to appreciate this kind of dark humor that goes together with strong violence. Otherwise, I have something to declare - stay away from it."

"bowmanblue","10","2","4","4 January 2017"," Lock stock and a much more A-list cast
","It's widely regarded that Guy Ritchie's first film, 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is pretty much a classic modern British gangster film. Therefore, much was riding on the – er – 'sequel', simply titled 'Snatch.' Now, first of all, it's not a sequel, although some people may think it felt like one.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if you're feeling even less charitable, you could even call it a 'remake' (or 'soft reboot' as has been used post 'The Force Awakens'). Because, even die-hard fans (of which I confess to being one) have to admit that it's basically the same story as Lock Stock, with basically the same characters, shot in basically the same style. Only with Brad Pitt thrown in there (and he's awesome).<br/><br/>So, despite a fair amount of cynicism associated with Snatch, it's actually pretty damn good. Yes, it is a slight copy of Lock Stock, but, when a film was so perfect as Lock Stock, it's difficult to hate anything that replicates it so well. To use another term, Snatch feels like it's set in a 'shared universe' (only with gangsters instead of Robert Downey Jr).<br/><br/>The characters, despite most being copies of its filmic predecessor, are still pretty memorable – despite Vinnie Jones and Jason Statham playing almost the same roles as before and the evil mob boss not really straying far from type, we also get a trio of hapless pawn store owners, a Russian hit man who just won't die and Brad Pitt. Did I mention he's in it? Brad Pitt is the standout for me. Too many times he's been written off as a pretty face only, but (as with 'Kalifornia') he proves that he's as good at acting as he is looking (and I sort of hate him for that, but still...). He steals every scene he's in as the hard-as-nails gypsy bare-knuckle boxer and has everything from the mannerisms to the accent down perfectly.<br/><br/>If you like gangster films of any nationality then you have to watch Snatch. Yes, it may not be quite as original as Lock Stock, but it's still worth a place in anyone's DVD collection.<br/><br/>Pity about 'Revolver' though. Don't know what happened there."

The first genuine laughs appear twenty minutes into the film with some witty stuff about a getaway driver who is too big for his car. That's your lot though, with just a few uncomfortable titters from an ominously subdued audience there-after, the humour coming across like the cynical laughter of a hand bag snatcher who has robbed a pensioner. Several adjectives spring to mind while watching this dispiriting drivel: brutal, cruel, empty, repellent, trite, repetitive. Because of this there is nothing to entertain you or to find the slightest bit enjoyable.<br/><br/>In the Snatch universe, mankind is base and indistinguishable from the animals in the picture. A dog chasing a hare is juxtaposed with a man being deliberately set upon by Rotweillers. Black people are portrayed as stupid and every other ethnic group as venal at best. Life is about individualism and greed. You are in debt to people and the worst that can happen to you is ending up as broke as you started in a zero sum game or cut to pieces and fed to pigs, literally 'returned to the earth from whence you came'. The world as abattoir. This makes the film an avowedly satanic tract, and the fact that this is seen as synonymous with commerciality makes it a long, depressing non-sequitur. I don't think it IS commercial, but there you have it. Who is the audience for this film? Despite this being a non-secular age supposedly disinterested in politics, Britain has always been a Christian country and I suspect some people will feel assaulted by this film without quite being able to put their finger on knowing why. It will be interesting to see how it does at the box office. It is horrific and affected me surprisingly deeply.<br/><br/>The scene with the police and an excuse involving a dog is actually taken from a real life incident with a gangster employee of the Kray twins. Likewise, this film is designed to be like one long pub anecdote, and it's no accident that this format was chosen as it puts the characters at a distant, as mere cyphers, so that it can concentrate exclusively on what it is truly turned on by: violence. It is a film in the service of evil rather than as an ironic counterpart to it.<br/><br/>""I've seen some performers in my time, but he enjoys his work. And that's not the half of it."""

I don't know whether I'm a big fan of the violence in this one, or maybe I just don't like hand to hand combat. The darkness is attributed with characters who have more depth than the characters in ""Lock Stock"". Though Brad Pitt's character is very funny, there is a moment, when his caravan is burning down, of a sad intensity in his eyes, there was nothing like this in ""Lock Stock"".<br/><br/>I think Guy Ritchie's character development shows that he has grown more from his first project. Though he is following the same formulas as his previous work, there is more elements added to ""Snatch"". I highly suggest if you haven't seen ""Snatch"" or ""Lock Stock"", I suggest seeing ""Lock stock"" first. Because they are highly comparable (as if you couldn't tell) and ""Lock stock"" will help you bone up on the way Guy Ritchie writes and directs.

","Some say that Snatch is a poor follow up of Ritchie's first film, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  I say that this is an improvement on his signature style, an aggressive and a supercharged 21-gun salute to Britain film/filmmakers. The deftness displayed in this writer/director's pacing and editing is at times electrifying and sometimes simply beautiful. The soundtrack is not only superb and includes one of my personal favorite bands, Oasis, and is used to great comic effect as an poignant accompaniment to certain scenes.<br/><br/>A more violent film you aren't likely to see this year. In the vein of Pulp Fiction, Trainspotting, and Fight Club, Snatch is a gritty dance with the criminal element, revolving around a stolen 86-karat diamond that any good crook would give his right arm for. (And in one case, I mean that literally.)<br/><br/>After a boggling series of double-crosses, triple-crosses, and multi-crosses, Snatch becomes a game of who will end up with the gem -- and how will they get it? Ritchie keeps us guessing at every turn, with Russians hiring mercenary crooks to steal the jewel, hit men sent to kill the mercenaries, mobsters trying to outwit the hit men, Jewish jewelers scheming to undermine the mobsters, a crazed bare-knuckled boxer looking for his payday despite the chaos, and one dog who's lost his bark.<br/><br/>And every one of these stories is hilarious.<br/><br/>Vinnie Jones (Gone in 60 Seconds) as Bullet Tooth Tony, a hunter/assassin who chills his prey with deadly stares; Benicio Del Toro (Traffic) is caught-in-the-middle robber/gambling addict; Dennis Farina, a stressed jeweler who can never catch a break; or any of two dozen other apt actors who fully own their roles. In the end, though, you have to give a hand to Brad Pitt, still buff from Fight Club, as a slur-mouthed Gypsy boxer who always manages to get one step ahead of the crowd.<br/><br/>Guy runs through the entire pantheon of MTV camera tricks: slow motion, fast motion, stop motion, reverse motion, low angles, high angles, upside down camerawork, and more.<br/><br/>There are some funny lines, and some of the violence is quite inventive.

","Guy Ritchie, the Man Who's Married To Madonna, directed this movie about missing jewels in London's boxing underground. Played out in the Goodfellas vein, there are characters with colorful personalities to match their colorful names, including Franky Four Fingers, Bullet Tooth Tony, One Punch Mickey O'Neil, Boris the Blade, Turkish, and Brick Top. Stylish and violent - but not in an off-putting way, if you're a fan of the genre, Snatch is all about ice, doublecrossings, fights, guns, blood, guts, ah, the fun never ends.   Brad Pitt plays a pugilistic gypsy (he's ""One Punch"") who delivers a wonderful engaging performance, speaking his lines in an almost unintelligible dialect. You see, everyone in the film (except for Dennis Farina, who plays Cousin Avi from the U.S.) is British. If you've never heard any Briton speak other than the high-class West End junk that the Queen uses, you'll be in for quite of a shock here. But once your ear gets tuned in to the accents, you'll be fine. (Of course, Pitt's Mickey was given that garbled tongue as kind of a way for the writer to poke fun at Britain's own dialects, which are understandably tough for non-Britons to decipher.) There are fixed fights, botched robberies, a dog who may have eaten a diamond, carnivorous pigs, and a getaway driver who has trouble getting away. You remember when Quentin Tarantino reintroduced the caper-gone-bad genre with movies like Pulp Fiction and reservoir Dogs? This one carries the torch a little bit further, and it's carried by a solid ensemble cast that includes Academy Award winner Benicio Del Toro (Frankie Four Fingers), Farina, and Pitt. The rest of the gang you might not recognize, but they're also not characters that simply dissolve into a scene, either. You know the kind - in a subpar gangster movie, all of the hitmen look alike. Not here. This is a cool, fun action film with panache and a touch of humor in the right places (sick humor, though)."

","SNATCH is a film, not unlike PULP FICTION, that blends together the lives of several colorful characters in unusual and entertaining ways.  The film focuses mainly on a rather large diamond, which is stolen by Franky Four Fingers (Del Toro).  This diamond passes from hand to hand in a dramatic series of events.  A fight promoter named Turkish (Statham) finds himself forced in league with a sneaky gypsy fighter named Mickey (Pitt).  If Turkish and his partner can't convince Mickey to take a dive in a fixed fight, they'll all face certain death at the hands of the sadistic Brick Top played by Alan Ford.  When Franky Four Fingers shows up missing, Cousin Avi (Farina) flys to London to bust some heads, along with the help of local tough guy Bullet Tooth Tony (Jones).  Two small time jewelry store owners and their portly pal find themselves unwittingly involved after kidnapping Franky, as ordered by a scary Russian arms dealer named Boris the Blade (Sherbedgia).  Everyone connects as the story unfolds, and despite how confusing everything gets, the film makes sense of it all within the last 30 minutes.  I liked SNATCH, if for no other reason because it plays against typical Hollywood formula.  The characters, while exotic and mostly with fancy names, seemed more real than the average movie fella.  The film feels a bit long, although it's average in running time.  There are great moments, and then there are moments that seem to slow everything down.  All in all every scene works together to build toward a collective ending, in which we get to see not necessarily a solution but rather a new beginning for the remaining players.  This is truly an ensemble piece.  I was surprised at how little Benicio had to do here.  He opens the picture, but his character soon fades making way for the numerous others.  Perhaps this was appropriate so that he wouldn't seem lost among the events.  Brad Pitt is hilarious, yet still finds time to convey emotion in a few select scenes.  Dennis Farina is Dennis Farina, and always does a good job.  Vinnie Jones plays the tough guy role again, although a bit subdued.  He gets a couple great scenes though, and still manages to look scary, even when he's smiling.  The performance that truly got me came from Alan Ford as Brick Top.  This guy is one mean dude!  It's amazing how a man who's older than all of the other cast members can exude so much power and feel so threatening.  Every time he showed up I was in fear for the characters around him.  SNATCH has it's share of violence, which is only outdone by it's swear count.

","On the strength of single viewing my comments my be a bit chaotic, but so was the film. In the best possible sense, that is. Guy Ritchie goes one better with this one. ""Snatch"" retreads exactly the same routes as in his previous effort: criminal underachievers vs hilariously sinister kingpins with farcical poetic justice madly flying around.<br/><br/>He utilizes cautiously the benefits of a larger budget and a flashier cast to commendable effect. The creative casting excats  the initial smile, from then on the excitement goes from strength to strength.

","If LSA2SB was your favourite film then there is no doubt that you are going to lap up this 2nd slice of stylised cockney hi-jinx. if you are expecting an improvement you may be disappointed.<br/><br/>Snatch tells the story of a couple of boxing promoters who get into a spot of jeopardy. When their prize fighter is lamped by a Â‘pikey' (gypsy) played by Brad Pitt), they are forced to turn to him in order to save their neck from a local wideboy named Bricktop.<br/><br/>Despite his ropey lingo, Brad Pitt easily steals the show with some terrific lines and some prolific punching.<br/><br/>There are lots of other elements to the film, diamonds, yardies, dogs, guns and armed robberies, not to mention bareknuckle fighting that has all the intensity seen in FIGHT CLUB.<br/><br/>The disappointing thing about Snatch is that, once you've heard a bit about it, the stars, the plot, the style!, it gives you an unachievable sense of expectation. That said, it is still one of the best example of small-time-blundering-cockney-gangster movies to come out of Britain.<br/><br/>
Another let down was Vinny Jones, he's featured in a variety of cringe-worthy in jokes (one featuring a like for like car door/head scene). He doesn't have the subtly of BIG CHRIS in LSA2SB, he seems a little too smug.<br/><br/>Overall it is a very entertaining hour or so, it feels like a more like one of the Lock Stock TV series rather than a new film in its own right.<br/><br/>
I think that the Lock Stock TV series severely undermines this film by already giving us a full set of 'pass the booty' shows , a formula that Guy Riches seem (more than a little) attached to.<br/><br/>Not as fresh as LSA2SB, but more brutal and a lot funnier. 8/10"

It is very obvious that the people making this film were way more interested in being cool than being good.<br/><br/>Many of the plot points are also very predictable. I won't give any away, but it was blaringly obvious from scene to scene which two or three groups of people would cross each other's path. <br/><br/>However, the acting is good, there are some truly funny parts, and the ending is satisfying.

""Snatch."" is about God knows what, but here's what I think it's about. A diamond is stolen and a bunch of people want it and there's some money involved and a fight. The fight involves ""One Punch"" Mickey (Brad Pitt) who is a Pikey (?) and you can't understand a single thing he says. I had to watch the movie in closed captioning. <br/><br/>The main problem is that the movie has too many characters. I'd give you a better plot description but that's all I can remember without looking up all the character's names. They all have some nickname (the only one I remember is Boris ""The Blade""). Anyway, there's too many characters and that muddles to plot. Too many things are going on and the plot is never explained very well. <br/><br/>Plus, I found most of the characters annoying. And what happened to Franky ""Four Fingers"" (Benicio Del Toro)? I guess I wasn't paying attention but he just disappeared. The movie was too vulgar and dark.

","Being one of the legion of fans of Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, I obviously had quite an expectation for Guy Ritchie's second film, Snatch. Having read reviews for Snatch prior to seeing it, I expected to see Lock Stock version two.  However, I was very pleasantly surprised to see that this was not the case. Snatch is a brilliant standalone film that is visually amazing from start to finish.  Sometimes the case is with visually spectacular films that the characters/story lines aren't developed properly, but Guy Ritchie is just as good at dialogue as he is a director.  In a way Snatch improves on Lock Stock's only flaw - the acting.  Lock Stock was restrained financially, so they were forced to use second-rate actors with very little to no experience.  Snatch applies the familiarity and experience of actors such as Brad Pitt, Oscar winner Benicio Del Toro and Dennis Farina. Snatch is a visual and aural feast (Ritchie loves fast-paced music to match the action), and is well worth your while to view it. <br/><br/>Snatch: 9/10"

","I had no idea what to expect when I went to see this film.  I was happily surprised at what I saw.  Guy Ritchie is another director who knows how to use high quality music video style, snappy editing and directing.  Ritchie has written another wild, snarled plot in the tradition of Pulp Fiction. Actually, this film is extremely similar to Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels - identical would not be a stretch.  But Ritchie is not plagiarizing - L, S, and 2SB is his film also. Like Run, Lola, Run, the music video style is used here only where it helps the film, not impedes it.  The most inventive use takes us across the Atlantic in about 3 seconds - you'll have to see it to know what I mean. Almost all the characters have incredibly thick accents, requiring complete attention on the part of the viewer to catch the dialogue.  But that only adds to the overall quirkiness of the film.  All the actors are fairly good. The one who really shines, though, is Brad Pitt.  He wallows in his seediness in this film, and appears to love doing it.  His impenetrable Irish accent is really impossible to decipher, and creates some very funny moments. The other thing Ritchie plays with is time.  A spectacular scene where three cars and three story lines interact is done in reverse.  This scene is absolutely hilarious and very inspired. Warning note to guys:  This is quite the guy's film.  Think twice about taking a date with you to this one. With that said, I need to go reserve my copy of the video before it comes out.  10/10!!!"

If you can get past the fact that Guy's obsession with gangsters involves a series of Minder-like creations, each with their own charming, often enigmatic moniker, then Snatch is a lot of fun.<br/><br/>As with Lock Stock, this is a complex tale of a heist gone wrong, a psychopathic crimelord (the terrifying Alan Ford, looking like Mike Myers as the dad in So, I Married an Axe Murderer), a couple of wide boys, and Brad Pitt as the incoheent Irish bare knuckle boxer, Mickey. There's about a dozen secondary characters, but let's leave them alone.<br/><br/>There are some fine moments in this densely plotted caper, although Dennis Farina looks like he's wandered in from another movie as Avi, the obligatory American used to sell the movie to the US market. <br/><br/>The other is Stateside thesp is Benicio Del Toro, a lot leaner after Leaving Las Vegas and far more coherent than in The Usual Suspects.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is great, the editing snappy and intriguing while Ritchie's dialogue ranged from the hilarious to the downright amateurish.<br/><br/>Vinnie Jones proves that he's no mere flash in the pan as Bullet tooth Tony, a far more rounded character than Sphinx in Gone in 60 Seconds. Oddly enough, he also gets a chance to cut a dog open in the hope of retrieving a vital plot device.<br/><br/>Yes, Snatch really is that subtle.<br/><br/>However, it's also a lot more likeable than GISS, with far more interesting characters and made for a lot less money.<br/><br/>And there's a chance to see Mike Reid giving a knockout performance as a faux Jewish diamond merchant.

I wanted to hate this film so much, but I wound up loving it.<br/><br/>""Lock Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels"" was Ritchie's ""True Romance"".  ""Snatch"" is his ""Resevoir Dogs"".  Ritchie succeeds where all the other Tarantino wannabes fail for two big reasons.  First, because he is the only post-Tarantino filmmaker who even approaches Tarantino's intellect.  He knows it's not just about swearing and carnage.  It's also about new ideas and cool dialogue.  The second reason he succeeds where others fail is that he takes the now-familiar formula away from Los Angeles and to London, where he takes full advantage of the range of British dialects to be heard in and around town.<br/><br/>The story involves a jewel heist, underground boxing, and the mobsters who run those enterprises.  The cast is uniformly great.  Dennis Farina is excellent as the jewel fence Avi.  Benicio Del Toro is just plain cool (as always) as Frankie Four-Fingers.  Alan Ford frightens as Brick Top.  And Vinnie Jones in the role of Bullet-Tooth Tony could teach John Wayne and Clint Eastwood a thing or two about being a tough guy.<br/><br/>As to Brad Pitt: In the first half of the '90's he was a shallow pretty boy. In the second half, he was pompous and overrated, trying too hard to live down his looks.  But in ""Snatch"" he finally delivers a performance that I actually liked as Mickey, a gypsy boxer who seems at first glance to be only comic relief, but turns out to be a pivotal character.<br/><br/>The film is not perfect.  One questions why everyone has a silly nickname, and some of Ritchie's stylistic flourishes serve only to distract from the story.<br/><br/>But overall, the film is wonderful.

","I've read some negative reviews of ""Snatch"" by some famous movie critics. Don't listen to them at all. The reason they don't like the movie is simple: they're too old for it, and they missed the point. They're used to the old, orthodox way of storytelling and this is too radical for them. I can't help but remember an anecdote about Beethoven, who upon hearing someone complain about his music being too ""strong"" replied: ""but this isn't for you, this is for future generations"". Same thing here, this movie is too good and too thrilling for obtuse minds. To dismiss the most common complaints, It's not ""disorganized"", it doesn't ""need a script doctor"", and it certainly doesn't ""have too many characters and locations"" (unless we're talking about people with really short attention spans). Few directors would be able to manage such a large cast, and so many threads with the class and skill of Ritchie. Probably you'll have to see it 2 or 3 times to understand all the twists and turns in the story, but you'll appreciate the editing and technique from the first time you see it.<br/><br/>If you liked ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", you'll love this one.

","Quite how this movie will fare internationally is uncertain, especially because many of its most prosperous jokes rely heavily on the more absurd pronounciations of cockney slang and incomprehensible drawl. But having overcome these minor problems, as well as the traditional stereotyping of the cockneys, Irish and Americans (among others), the film is wholly enjoyable. <br/><br/>Most impressive for a relatively low-budget movie such as this were the camera effects and the soundtrack. Director Guy Ritchie is such a master of the former that some of his more contrived camera angles and movements were alone enough to invoke laughter. Many of the jokes are in fact derived from the excellent script, which was in part written by Ritchie himself, although some of the humour originates from the brilliant acting.<br/><br/>There will of course be some who complain that ""Snatch"" degrades cinema, inciting audiences to laugh at violence. But it is only because the movie is so involving and evocative that the audience feels morally secure enough to cheer on, and laugh with, the gangsters on screen. The most promising thing about this film is that Guy Ritchie has proved himself to be a more than capable director, and not just a one-hit wonder (his previous movie, ""Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels (1998),"" was also critically acclaimed).<br/><br/>
The US has always been quite reluctant in its uptake of foreign movies, especially those as alien as ""Snatch."" But this movie is so funny, and its plot is so clever, that it is well worth seeing, even if you are American. I'd pay $10 to see this any day. 9 out of 10."

Although at times the editing does much to jar the flow of the story, it still manages to hold the attention, and provides a number of great set pieces and laughs. Praised for his first foray in front of the screen in Lock Stock, Vinnie Jones goes one better in this film with an extremely good cameo. It is also great to see the underrated Benicto Del Torro in use, all be it under-used yet again. Brad Pitt manages to work a great comedy performance out of his boxing pikey, and, with the labourious Nick Moran and the ridiculous Dexter Fletcher dropped for this film, the acting seems alltogether more professional and more believable at every level. Ritchie shows more flashes of inventiveness, and with an amazing finale, Snatch will undoubtedly stand on its own merits rather than being dismissed as formaliac under-performance from all involved."

"Benjy","7","0","0","3 September 2000"," Doesn't quite live up to the hype
","I guess like most people I really liked Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels so my expectations were very high for Snatch. After all Guy Ritchie had managed to recruit two of my favourite American actors in Brad Pitt and Dennis Farina. However it seems that my expectations were a little too high. There is so much to commend this film, the acting on the whole is very good, Brad Pitt being particularly worthy of note and Vinnie Jones given a little more depth with Bullet Tooth Tony than he was with Big Chris, but having said that I found it very hard going at times, especially when the cockney gangsters were around. I know it's a comedy (and Ritchie's script provides plenty of laughs) but gangsters are supposed to be hard! There's just something about a cockney accent to me that makes it seem, I don't know, comical I guess. Bricktop lacks the menace of the villains in Lock, Stock and you have to wonder how he got into such a position in the first place. The direction is clever, particularly the opening sequence but it leaves me slightly cold. It's too stylised and reminds me more of adverts than it should, though how much of that is due to adverts being derivative of Guy Ritchie or vice versa I'm not so sure. Ritchie's dialog is much better than his previous film but his plot, I'm afraid to say is vastly inferior and feels a little hurried at times, the plot itself is not overly complex but Ritchie's direction serves to make it more so. His occasional use of flashbacks to different characters do not work too well either. Guy Ritchie is an accomplished and talented writer and while his Direction is stylish it still needs a lot of work. All things said Snatch is by no means the worst film of the year and is well worth going to see, just don;t go in with your expectations too high. 7/10."

","Personally I was getting a bit bored of British gangster movies after the amount of rubbish that followed Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (with the exception of Gangster No 1).  Snatch, though, reminded me why I liked Guy Ritchie's first film so much.  It's all very well having a complex, twisty plot, but Snatch also has killer dialogue and is extremely funny.

Well, the easy way is not that easy when independent plots converge on cops-and-robbers after many laughs of robbers-and-robbers that carries the film.  <br/><br/>This is an oddly funny film once one tunes the ear to British country way of speaking.  What?  What did they say....?<br/><br/>It is always nice to see a movie with a cast of actors who want to bubble to the top -- and clearly have their day in the roles in this movie.  Two actors were strangely placed.  First, Benicio Del Toro (""TRAFFIC"") appears as Franky Four Fingers which was a distraction as I asked myself, ""Where do I know that person from???  My 30cent a gallon WATER store owner in Culver City?""   And then the star with bottom billing while giving his best performance in recent filmology, none other than Brad Pitt (One Punch' Mickey ONeil ).<br/><br/>The planned snatching of a prized diamond only sets the stage for a strange and wonderful adventure in the English craving for good, innocent crime (s) that excels in complicity all things that would shock Sherlock plots.<br/><br/>Just tune your ears, and don't worry about One Punch' Mickey ONeil.

","Britain's current infatuation with vicious, throat-cutting gangster culture continues with this piece of exploitation which is neither as funny nor as charming as it would like you to think it is.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie, a semi-aristocrat with pretensions to working class chic, attempts to sustain the myth that all gangsters are just loveable rogues rather than the sadistic sociopaths that they really are. Sure, violent men have their reasons to be violent and many fine films have been made which have sensibly explored the theme of male violence. Snatch is not one of these. <br/><br/>The day when an audience is expected to derive amusement from the exploits of psychopaths and enjoy a 'good laugh' along with them as they dish out their un-metered brutality is a day when... hang on a minute!

Let me say this to you, this guy is not a new Tarantino or a british Tarantino. He is a filmmaker who stands on his own and does not copy Tarantino in a way. He just happens to make the same sort of films as Tarantino.<br/><br/>To cut that crap. What about the film itself. Well it is a really good film, although sometimes hard to understand due to some bad accents (thank god we have subtitles here). The story is well directed and the actors are all good.

But the suggestion of certain methods of feeding pigs, as well as the excessive appearance of blood and violence could have been avoided. On the other hand, the comic appeal of this film was first-rate and original. However, I was saddened that Benicio del Toro did not have a larger role in the film.

","Is genius too strong an adjective to describe Snatch? I don't think so. What an intelligent piece of collaborative work. The audience is catapulted through this masterpiece relentlessly. Lightning quick shifts, ominous underlying violence and many hearty giggles from the beginning straight to the end await you. British maestro, writer/director, Guy Ritchie ( his first feature was that super Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) is an immense talent who has, once again, has brought to our shores one of the most original and refreshing films of our time.<br/><br/>Snatch's story goes...There's been a heist of an eighty-six carat diamond...Franky Four Fingers (Benicio ""Come on man! Don't three freakin' movies out at once mean I can at least smoke in here? Christ!"" Del Toro) is the lead bad- guy- robber man. Now he's in charge of bringing the multiple carats to the Jewish launderette.

Boris the Blade is ready for the sharp- dressed- digit- missing-mutli lingual chap. Boris' mission? Get that diamond from Franky! Hmm. Franky's tough. Franky's mean. Franky's not going down easy. What's his weakness? Fine clothes? A good cigar? Chit chat on precious stones of the Aztecs? Noop. But Boris knows.<br/><br/>Now we start to understand the plights of our narrator, a man named Turkish (Jason Statham-yes, he played Bacon in director Rictchie's other masterpiece Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels). He's a pretty straight arrow in the boomerang business of promotions and gamblings. His partner Tommy is about to make a faux pas so terrible, their days of roasting sausages happily in a grill next to their filthy boxing ring may come crashing to an end. A smelly pig pen of an end...<br/><br/>Meet the rooter of all Turkish's troubles, a man named Brick Top (Alan ""Austin Powers chompers"" Ford). Bricky wants a favor...Brick's running an illegal boxing match and wants to use one of Turk's guys. You don't want to be mixed up with this Black Top, er, Brick Top guy. Think dying at the hands of rabid pigs starved till human meat looks like banana sundaes with extra fudge..A fantastic villain.<br/><br/>Enter a few guys (Robbie Gee, Lennie James, and Ade) just eeking by. Till Boris strikes up a deal with them. All they have to do is get the briefcase Franky Four Fingers has bolted to his arm...bring it to Boris and they get their dough...<br/><br/>With me so far? Okay, next let's just say Turkish's fore mentioned partner loses the boxer evil psycho Brick Top's counting (and betting heavy bacon bits) on...Enter a ""Piker"" named Mickey. Piker appears to be the Queen's Land's slang for white- trash- trailer- park-folk- that live like gypsy's and speak in a brogue meant to daze and confuse their prey.<br/><br/>What's this? Where's Franky? Franky's been seen at the jewelers. He was seen at the tailor's (and let me just aside a moment with what fun it is watching actor Del Toro get fitted for several outfits-it was like a virgin's dirty dream- that man can wear clothes- she said wiping the droplets of sweat from her forehead). That's it! New Yorker, cousin Avi's (a hysterical Dennis Farina), jumping the pond- he's very concerned about Franky and his briefcase, er, health.<br/><br/>Still cousin Avi can not locate FFF. He calls in a friend, Bullet Tooth (Vinnie -nice and tall. A true manyumsicle- Jones). Bullet's got a bone to pick with just about everyone.

He's such a phenomenal, exciting actor. You never know what he's going to bring to the screen!<br/><br/>Benicio Del Toro finally shows his studmuffin physique again- feared to be a distant memory after the recent rotunda role of Javier .( A friend thought I needed therapy when I insisted he truly was an attractive, intelligent, literate guy) You'll be seeing a lot more of this guy.

Vinnie Jones and Dennis Farina turn in standout performances but it's Brad Pitt who takes this one. Every scene that he's in makes you pay a little more attention because he's simply hilarious.

","After viewing the trailer to the film Snatch I was anxious to see it. I loved the stylized directing, clever art design and tasteful choice of modern music.

What a pity, this film could have been great, and in almost all regards it is. Take out approximately ten minutes of murdering and change a few minutes of dialogue and you would have an enduring film that would appeal to anyone. Having been the victim of violence (that and having a shred of decency) I do not find it entertaining. I was sickened by the grotesque and shameless cruelty Snatch portrays as if it were the accidental bumping into someone on the train. That is the most disturbing element in Snatch, like in other films of it's genre, (i.e.) Pulp Fiction, Casino, Millers Crossing, the happy go lucky attitude the characters take toward it's violence, as if it were a normal carefree event. Good Lord. If I make a film about rape, aren't I obligated to make a statement against such behavior? Otherwise, I condone it by default. Is this really the direction we want society to go? Don't people who enjoy watching brutal violence understand that it is at least desensitizing the people who watch it and at most encouraging such behavior? How about snuff films and human sacrifice while we're at it? Also, are the fans of this genre so shallow that they cannot separate the violence from the uniqueness the film offers? Being a fan of ska music, I know there are many neo-racist bands out there I would enjoy but I refuse to support their message. Just because Snatch has high production value, can't we agree that this type of entertainment must not be tolerated? If not, well, prepare yourself for an uglier neighborhood you helped to create.

Almost a Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels in reverse the plot is at first complicated but soon straightens itself out for many impressive twists of narrative and comedy sidelines.  Vinnie Jones is largely wasted in a very good role while many of the attempts at humorous banter appear unrehearsed and consequently pretty lame.<br/><br/>A solid ensemble piece, Brad Pitt should be highlighted for his consistently funny Irish gypsy and Mike Reid excels himself.

I enjoyed watching Dennis Farina in a character part that was perfectly suited to him. Brad Pitt's gypsy was great, and suitably folded into the story to mute his superstar/superhunk appeal. There were too many great characters to name, but Alan Ford, as Brick Top, had that remarkably funny and sadistic edge of Hopkins as Hannibal.

","Chaotic, witty, eccentric, and hip, Guy Ritchie's latest film ""Snatch"" is a visual bombast involving an eclectic array of intriguing characters. Ritchie takes us on a fast-paced ride through London, introducing us to a four-fingered gambler (Del Toro), a saturnine boxing promoter named Turkish (Statham), his lovable maladroit partner Tommy (Graham), a bullet-dodging Russian (Serbedzija), the wanna-be-jewish diamond dealer Doug the Head (Reid), the authentic jewish diamond dealer Cousin Avi (Farina), a marble-mouthed gypsy boxer (Pitt), and many other diversified characters. Each personality has it's own individualized mark which together form a melange of the bizarre. Set in London, the story follows what happens surrounding a much sought after 84 karat diamond. As the plot begins to unfold, the interlocking stories involving unlicensed boxing, stolen diamonds, and caravans are revealed to make for a witty nearly unimaginable ending. Ritchie's innovative cinematography including quick paced action-to-freeze-frame-cuts and split screens is captivating, stylish, zany, and full of frenetic energy. In addition to Ritchie's remarkable camerawork, his choice of music is not to be left unnoticed. Offbeat cuts like Klint's Diamond, Disco Science by Mirwais, and Massive Attack's Angel coexist perfectly with the skittish visuals.

","""Snatch"" gave me my fix. I've read or heard some people say that they didn't like this because it had too many similarities to Ritchie's previous film ""LS2SB,"" and they are right. Double-crosses, almost need subtitles accents, Vinnie Jones playing a muscle for hire, and instead of two funny bumbling crooks like ""LS2SB,"" we have three absolutely hysterical bumbling crooks here, and many more that I haven't mentioned. Why don't I mention them? Because it doesn't matter because ""Snatch"" is one hell of a flick. I can't say which is better. ""Lock, Stock..."" had a very good premise and also had heart in the right places (notably the father-son relationships between some of the characters), and also had a lot of laughs. ""Snatch"" cuts right to the teeth with biting dark comedy and great performances by the players involved. The great Benicio Del Toro does what he can with relatively small screen time. Jason Statham has grown since ""Lock, Stock..."", probably because Ritchie gave him a bigger role as Turkish. And you gotta love the Yanks of the film: Dennis Farina and Brad Pitt. With his demanding attitude and sharp lines, Farina shells out one of his best performances of his career. Pitt is like a limey Tyler Durden without the darkness and more humorous spunk. I think Ritchie's plan to have Pitt speak that dialect was because not one American could understand what the characters said in ""Lock, Stock..."" (even I had to use closed captioning a couple times). So, he gets an American actor who speaks something no one understood to hilarious effect. But, the top performance here goes to Alan Ford. The narrator of ""Lock, Stock..."" creates a frightening yet funny character in Brick Top. He says most of the films best lines and has probably the best facial expressions in the film (most likely helped by those thick-rimmed glasses).<br/><br/>All in all, this was a great film. And while I will always follow Ritchie in his career, I think he should put the crime genre away for at least a few films. He is capable of so much more, and it's evident in his stylish direction and his ear for sharp dialogue. What I say to him is good luck, and don't put Madonna in ANY of your films. Maybe sing on the soundtrack, but not act. She's not as British as she pretends to be."

The story will keep you on the edge of your seat and the ending is as satisfying as it can be, you will be talking about the movie before you leave the theatre. Go see this ASAP!"

","First, I must say GO see Snatch!!  It is hilariously funny, especially Turkish and his sidekick.  It has wonderful visual arts, especially with Brad Pitt.  His character is so likable and emotional.  It is a light thriller with a 83 carat diamond.  It goes from Frankie Four Fingers, to Sol, and ends up in its ""rightful owner"".  You must see Snatch, it is a riot, with twists turns, and laughs.  P.s.  the dog is the best!!"

"bogiefan-2","9","0","0","28 January 2001"," A Stylish & Engaging Thriller... Congratulations Guy Ritchie!
","Guy Ritchie has directed a stylish and engaging thriller the likes of which I have not seen in many years (I kept having feelings not experienced since ""Pulp Fiction"" and perhaps even 1985's ""No Surrender"" - but that was a long time ago and an altogether very different film).  I enjoy good thrillers and this one is top-notch.  Yes, there is a lot of violence - including unlicensed, bare-knuckle boxing - but the omnipresent humour lets the audience accept the violence as the context within which stories like this happen.  It's hard to wince when a dog in the background is squeaking because of a squeaky toy it had swallowed whole earlier in the film.  Not tremendously clever but it works very well in this movie.<br/><br/>The acting? Top drawer stuff.  Jason Statham's ""Turkish"" is excellent and even Brad Pitt's performance is very good.  Alan Ford's ""Brick Top"" is absolutely wonderfully delivered - this character is positively scary - and Dennis Farina (""Cousin Avi"") is quite good as well.  Sure, none of the roles called for much emotional range but there were no embarrassing accents or out-of-character moments which destroy lesser outings.  The entire cast merits high marks - as much for supplying the comic relief as for ensuring that no part of this movie dragged.<br/><br/>The story? It's actually an amalgam of several stories where the weaving is at such a breakneck speed that you have to keep on top of the cast of characters or you run the risk of losing the thread altogether.  The stylish introduction of all the main characters at the beginning of the movie turns out to be not only style but substance.<br/><br/>While the story starts out as a standard heist plot, it departs from it very quickly as one group after another is brought into contact with - and possession of - the stolen gem.  The interesting thing is that story ends up being as much about ""One Punch"" Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), an Irish gypsy (called ""Pikey's"" apparently) as it is about this giant diamond.  The real interest in this story comes from the connections between the quest for this diamond and the story about Mickey O'Neill's abbreviated boxing career.<br/><br/>If you can keep up with its pace, ""Snatch"" is an excellent thriller to go see and will certainly be first class video rental fodder in the future. Congratulations to Guy Ritchie - I'll be renting his earlier outing, ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" sometime soon.  For the time being, I give this one a 9."

","Okay, so here's the deal with this movie: its an absolutely amazing movie. That is, if, and only if, you haven't seen Guy Ritchie's other great movie: Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels. Despite being cleverly crafted to all come together in one magnificant moment - much like LS&2SB - and being full of both, humour and serious moments, Snatch was somewhat of a let down to me. If you haven't already seen Lock, Stock I recommend picking one of the two. The format, the characters, the same reference to a certain group of people (ze germans in this case) was all too Lock Stock; there was a point where I wasn't sure which movie I was watching anymore. But if you manage to get over that little upset, you'll find Lock Stock to be an entertaining movie which does draw close parallels to the real world of illegal boxing. All in all, my hats off to Guy Ritchie for the most part, although change is never a bad thing. Also, my compliments to the person who did the casting. Each actor really truly fit their part - including Brad Pitt, who personally I thought would no way be able to play a pikey. I was wrong."
"Funky A","8","0","0","29 January 2001"," Excellent entertainment with a lot of style.
","Snatch is an excellent action movie with a lot of style. First of all, the cast is excellent, the best being Brad Pitt, which is impressive as ""One Punch"" Mickey O'Neil. The story is simple but told in a way to make it a bit confusing, a bit like Pulp Fiction did. It's not revolutionnary but it is very good. The characters are awesome. But the biggest reason why this film is not just another action movie is Guy Ritchie's stylish directing. His style reminds me a bit of Danny Boyle, one of my favorite directors, but he uses more slow-motions and it is clear that he has done music videos. But while some directors don't know how to use this influence to make a movie instead of a 2 hours long music video(for example, the incompetent who directed the awful Charlie's Angels), Ritchie uses strange camera angles and effects to give style to his story and create images which are hard to forget. Snatch will neither change the way you look at movies nor will it tell you anything about the meaning of life, but you will have a great time and you will not forget some of the images for a long time(I won't tell you which ones because I would give away the story). Anyway, I highly recommend it and after a year of so-so movies with a few exceptions, it is fun to see a really good one.<br/><br/>81%"

","First of all, don't make the mistake of labelling Snatch as the British Pulp Fiction.  Pulp Fiction and Snatch have nothing in common.  Pulp fiction rejuvaneted the crime genre in 94', so don't expect Snatch to do the same. Make no mistake, Snatch is an excellent film, yet it makes no attempts to hide what it is: a quick fun film.<br/><br/>If not evident from his previous film, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Guy Ritchie is a director to watch.  Snatch is a slickly made film from beginning to end.  The spinning, freezing, zooming camera shots create a style distinctive to Ritchie.  If anything, Snatch is fun to look at.<br/><br/>What really makes the film shine is the meandering and interweaving plotlines of the various characters.  Snatch manages to create numerous hilarious situations out of your standard steal the diamond bit.  The movie never slows down and will have you captivated from beginning to end.<br/><br/>The number of colorful and varied characters make for fun dialogue, and accents.  Brad Pitt is hilarious and totally convincing.  Again, don't go in with any pre judgements (i.e. the a fight club mind set).  His role in Snatch eclipses that of Tyler Durden.  It would be futile to describe the rest of the excellent cast.  Oh, and then there's the dog (worth the price of admission alone).  Ritchie takes every chance he gets to poke fun at anything and everything, and it works splendidly.<br/><br/>Snatch, though not wholly original is a gem.

The quick fast-paced shots are really fun and give the film an almost campy feel.  <br/><br/>The cast is absolutely hilarious and cast perfectly for each role.  Brad Pitt portrays Mickey, a gypsy bare-knuckle boxing champion, who takes down his opponents with one hard swift punch and literally mumbles every word out of his mouth.  Damn near the whole time Pitt is on screen you try to decipher the jibberish coming out of his mouth at a mile-a-minute.  Benicio Del Toro, who is currently riding an amazing hot streak starring in three movies currently in wide release being ""Snatch"", Sean Penn's ""The Pledge"", and Steven Soderbergh's ""Traffic""; plays Franky ""Four-Fingers"".  Franky is addicted to gambling and is also, currently, holding onto a 84 karat diamond which is the target of everyone in the film at one point or another.  He is holding it for Dennis Farina's character Cousin Avi, who lives in New York City and has to go over to England after Franky disappears.  Farina is absolutely hilarious and, definitely, one of the higher points of a great cast.  Ritchie alumni Vinnie Jones delivers the audience another fun character to eat up in hitman for hire Bullet Tooth Tony.<br/><br/>Even though the whole plot of the movie has been done before the delivery really gives ""Snatch"" a bit of a new feeling.  Plus it's just flat-out fun. Don't go into the movies expecting a masterpiece in the likes of ""Pulp Fiction"" and you will probably have a great time.<br/><br/>All in all; a fun, fast-paced, in-your-face gangster flick for the new year. <br/><br/>8.5/10"

","Movies like Pulp Fiction make you forget you are watching a film and make you feel as though you are seeing real, albeit strange, but nonetheless real characters at work.  Snatch does that as well.  Most of us have very different lives.  We all punch the clock, go to work, play with the dog, watch sports and whatever else it is that we do during our day.  But in Guy Ritchie's labrynthian like tail, no one is normal.  No one does things that the rest of us would do.  They are all bound by the Tarantinoesque laws of fiction.  And those laws dictate that if there is trouble to find, they find it and if there is a situation that calls for impropriety, it is here, in this film.<br/><br/>Snatch is a lot of fun.  When you inhabit a world that shares it's space with guys like Bullet Tooth Tony, Doug The Head, One Punch Mickey, Frankie Four Fingers, Boris The Blade, Turkish, Brick Top and Cousin Avi, you can't help but to have fun.  The story is quite complicated and by the time you figure out exactly what is going on, a different angle to the story is introduced.  But in some way or another, every member of this story is involved in one way or another, with a diamond that has 84 carats to it. Frankie Four Fingers steals it, Boris the Blade wants it, so does cousin Avi as does does Bullet Tooth Tony.  Turkish gets messed up in it somehow and then so does BrickTop, which brings in One Punch Mickey.  Confused, you ain't seen nothing yet.  <br/><br/>What it comes down to though is that you don't really have to know exactly who fits where in the story.  I stopped keeping track of everyones importance about a third of the way through the film.  I was having too much fun.  Once again we are treated to Benetio Del Toro's mastery of accents as this time he brandishes a Turkish/Russian/Arabian accent.  The man really is the best actor out there today.  Too bad he dies early in the film, I would have liked to see more of him. Then we are introduced to Brad Pitt and he has a ""whoknowswhatkindof"" accent.  As they say in the film, it is not Irish, not English, just Pygmie.  Half the time you have no idea what he saying and the other half you are just barely making it out.  But he is incredibly humourous and when he is hard to understand is some of the best humour in the film.  Brad Pitt is one hell of an under rated actor but with films like this, he is sure to get a little recognition.<br/><br/>Snatch is violent and it is mean but it does it so stylishly that it becomes fun.  I think this is a Pulp Fiction like clone.  It is not as good, nothing ever will be, but it is a worthy imitator.  Having fun at the movies is what being there is all about.  Snatch never forgets that. <br/><br/>9 out of 10- One of the films that will probably make my ten best at the end of 2001."

There was something nicely unreal about ``Lock Stock ..."" -- the camera tricks like slowing down and speeding up time, the vaguely sepia-toned film stock, and so on -- but you just felt you were watching reality through a lens. Clearly Guy Ritchie is trying to bring unreality to ``Snatch"", but it comes off as more comical than ``Lock Stock ..."".

","During one of the first scenes of Snatch, I got worried.  I was worried that Guy Ritchie was a fraud(well not so much a fraud as a fluke.)  While Franky Four Fingers and his crew were stealing the diamond in question, Ritchie utilized this cheesy camera technique of zooming in real fast while turning it at an angle, I looked like a bad music video, or someone trying to look like Guy ritchie, and it looked way to polished)not to be confuded with good)  Anyway, this turned out to be a misconception on my part, as the rest of the film blew me away.  Ritchie is certainly a talented, even revolutionary filmmaker. I keep hearing alot from critics about how his movies have too many characters, the plotlines are too convoluted.  I couldn't disagree more. Ritchie deftly rolls out story lines weaves them together, and keeps you guessing til the very end, all the while spewing out classic lines of dialogue.  His frenetic pace, although not at all traditional among the film community, is representative of modern pop culture, and works magnificently if only you let it. Anyway, I can't believe anyone would have a problem with being exposed to all these great characters anyway, Ritchie truly has a knack for creating awesome, fleshed-out and altogether sordid characters.  Even though some of the ones in Snatch were really just re-hashing of ones from Lock Stock, everyone has such an individual quality that makes them stand out on their own.

The collection of characters are all fascinating; the plot is complex, but the breathtaking pace of the journey through its twists and turns is (with a single very moving exception) delightful; the score is perfectly chosen to support each scene, and the acting is an ensemble tour de force, not the least of which is Brad Pitt's dedicated performance."
"wackrhymz","10","0","0","20 January 2001"," Guy Ritchie has done it again!
","After such a classic piece of cinema, like ""Lock, Stock..."", you'd think the pressure of making his second full length film, might weigh down the plot or direction. I'm happy to say that Guy Ritchie has done it again, making a movie that will no doubt become a classic action film. Set in London, ""Snatch"" is the story of Turkish and Tommy, two unlicenced boxing promoters who get in trouble with a gangster named Brick Top. Turkish's boxer, Gorgeous George is supposed to go down in the 4th round but when Tommy and George got into some hot water with a group of gypsies led by Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt, in one of his best performances). George gets into a fight with Mickey and Mickey knocks George's lights into the next world. Turkish decides to substitute Mickey for George in the big fight but when Mickey doesn't go down in the 4th, Turkish and Tommy sink deeper into trouble.<br/><br/>In another plot line, jewish diamond thief, Franky Four Fingers (Benico Del Toro) steals a diamond ""the size of a fist"" and is then robbed buy 3 stupid jewelry wholesalers and their crazy gypsie dog. But they run into one small problem, the case with the stone in it is chained to Franky's arm, so they take Franky with them to meet the buyer, russian ex-KGB assassin, Boris the Blade. Back in the USA, Cousin Avi (Denis Farina, playing another foul mouthed mobster) finds out that Franky has been robbed and he won't get his giant diamond. Avi flies to London and must find his 86 karat stone with the help of Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) a man who took six bullets to the head and is still tickin'. He even had some of the bullets molded into teeth to replace the one's he lost. Sound complicated? Don't worry, it's not. With his brilliant directing style, Richie has made a movie that will make you laugh, cry and maybe even puke if you have a Really weak stomach. Plus some of the best boxing sequences filmed since ""Raging Bull"" Any way you slice it, ""Snatch"" is a winner! 10/10"
"ferguson-6","8","0","0","22 January 2001"," Stealing On and Off Screen
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Madonna's hubby is no dummy.  He steals from the best.  The influence of Tarantino is obvious, but in ""Snatch"" and ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" I see a great deal of Scorcese as well.  When you learn from these two and throw in a twisted, darkly comical screenplay and amazing acting from the ensemble cast, Guy Ritchie provides us with this years best guilty pleasure!  I found myself alterately laughing and squirming with the unique mix of violence and a remarkably high number of scenes where at least one character is asking himself, ""What am I doing here?"".  Alan Ford steals his scenes as Brick Top - a perfect name for such a charming guy.  Brad Pitt turns in a beautiful performance as a character right out of the Paul Bunyon school of Tall Tales.  Although brief in screen time, Benicio Del Toro again shows why he is well on his way to stardom.  I just hope he continues to be very selective on his roles and doesn't turn in to Kevin Bacon, god forbid.  No real tidbit on this other than make sure to enjoy the dialogue.  It is, for the most part, easily understood if one concentrates.  I did not find it to be a distraction, and I am from TEXAS! Looking forward to more from Guy Ritchie, but I do hope he learns to minimize the visual distractions (clever camera work) to the point that it does not interfere with the story."

","Guy Ritchie. I'd never heard of him before seeing this movie and looking it up. He is brilliant. Snatch was entertaining and then some... it was well written, fast paced, funny, full of action, etc. And I love the more ""artistic"" directing style. The characters (which there were alot of! I loved the intro!) were excellent and the dialogue was great. I don't normally write reviews for movies on here, because I'm never quite sure what to say.

A fun, fast film, not quite the same enjoyment level as the Guy Ritchie's film which proceeded it (Lock, Stock...) but better than most of what airs in the U.S.A. Ritchie proves that he is most decidely the fresh blood american box offices need, along with Troy Duffy, whose excellent work, Boondock Saints, should be viewed with Ritchie's films as a new approach to Noir. The entire cast make the film fun, and it is great to see Vinnie Jones return as a merciless hitman. A great cast, some fun turns, and an all out joy to watch.

I kept thinking to myself what am I missing. Trick editing, fancy opticals, and effects don't replace character development.  Everything that was funny was trying to be funny.  I hate laughing on cue so I hardly did.  <br/><br/>Guy Ritchie won't stand the test of time.  He's a pop director making pop films.  The movie was a real sweet piece of candy that makes you a little high at first but ultimately does nothing for you.  <br/><br/>Even Tarantino pays more attention to character development.

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","7","2","5","8 March 2018"," An energetically eclectic, hyperactive yet occasionally unfocused comedy of errors.
","'Snatch (2000)' is an energetically eclectic, hyperactive yet occasionally unfocused comedy of errors in which whatever could go wrong does go wrong. It's a series of eventually intertwining parallel stories each centred around a stolen stone which feature a cast of colourful, mostly inept characters with slightly weird names and a mainly cockney lilt (aside from the Russian, the American and the sort-of-but-not-really Irish thing that Brad Pitt tries to do). It deals in stereotypes and the comedy is pretty broad, but the film isn't so much funny as it is exhaustively coincidental in a strangely compelling way, with the usually dumb-as-bricks characters making a major mistake only to run into someone (sometimes literally) who then fixes that mistake or changes their path entirely. It's not so much a straightforward narrative as one that keeps you guessing as to where it's going to go while simultaneously not mattering at all, as it's the individual situations themselves that entertain. The fact it all ties together in the end is, strangely, kind of a bonus. 7/10"
"srepolt","10","2","5","17 June 2016"," Guy Ritchie is one of the most underrated directors of our time!
","To simply put it, this is my Generations Pulp Fiction. With that being said I know there are people on IMDb who would disagree but that's just because this movie is not meant to be taken too seriously. Just like Tarantino, this movie is heavily character driven which is anchored on very clever set ups. The only deference is that the story for the most part is told in a linear fashion and it also happens to be much more lighthearted considering all of the violence. If you are a fan of knuckle headed crime dramas that are filled with over the top exaggerated characters, than this movie is for you. It has action, well fleshed out characters, hilarious dialogue, and a very intriguing premise that once you start watching, you can't help but want to know the films final outcome. Overall Snatch is very well acted and entertaining movie for fans of Tarantino style crime films."

","Snatch (2000)<br/><br/>Director Guy Ritchie is most famous as a filmmaker, and that says a lot, because he could have become known as Madonna's husband. And he survives (and thrives, commercially) on two knock out, inventive, slightly zany and slightly brilliant films, ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" followed by this one. Both have a bigger than life, faster than life, slightly impossible feel that is something like Tarantino in ""Kill Bill"" or maybe Jarmusch in ""Ghost Dog."" <br/><br/>""Snatch."" is the second of the two and is a bigger budget, more mainstream movie in some ways, and this might seem to be a good thing, though there are avid fans of his first film for its fresh intensity, for sure. ""Snatch"" is kept alive by the constant breaking of the time line, the really absurd and kinetic presence of Brad Pitt (who is brilliant), and the overall plot line(s) which are filled with twisted archetypes. It's also well constructed and filmed without becoming slick. But in the end, you'll find that the two movies are too similar to make sense in some ways. And both films have this sense of being actually about nothing, in the end. They are just wild rides. <br/><br/>But such rides. Sometimes you just want to get in your car and drive and have things happen, and so they do here, and it's totally Fun. Fun capital F because in a way, why not make that the goal. Clearly there is no social message or deep psychology at work, which is just fine with me. And so you need to position yourself to float in this world, and see how richly constructed it is, you just watch and have things happen. On those terms it's remarkable."

"sublime501","10","2","5","18 July 2004"," MAN--Guy Ritchie is a f***ing genius!
","SNATCH has two main plots. The first is of an unlicensed boxing promoter named Turkish (Jason Statham) and his sidekick Tommy (Stephen Graham), who get ordered by Brick Top (Alan Ford) to arrange a fight and then throw it. After Turkish and Tommy's original fighter, Gorgeous George (Adam Fogerty), is made unable to fight by the gypsy Mickey (Brad Pitt), the pair convinces Mickey to fight instead. When Mickey fails to go down in the fourth as Brick Top instructs Turkish and Tommy to make him do, he puts the two in a potentially lethal position if he doesn't come through the next time.<br/><br/>The other plot is about a diamond heist. Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) and his men steal it initially, but then the diamond is stolen by Vinny (Robbie Gee), Sol (Lennie James), and Tyrone (Ade). Soon Avi (Dennis Farina) and his men, who were supposed to receive the diamond from Franky Four Fingers, come looking for it, putting Vinny, Sol, and Tyrone in potentially lethal situations as well.<br/><br/>Got all of that? I know, it's a lot for just one movie.<br/><br/>But man... SNATCH has to be one of the best movies I've seen recently. I saw it on TV one night and was blown away even then, and knew I had to rent the unedited version. I was very, very impressed. The four main things that make SNATCH so good:<br/><br/>1. The screenplay. It's absolutely hilarious and very well-written. For the most part it's very lighthearted and fun, but there are a couple of really powerful scenes as well (the burning of the caravan and after Gorgeous George gets knocked out). And, might I add, the plots and the way they, and the characters they involve, interact... is genius.<br/><br/>2. The acting. All of the actors are brilliant and perfect in their roles, adding the right amounts of humor and seriousness at the right times. It's hard for me to pick out any standout actors, because they're all terrific--but, if I have to: Jason Statham and Stephen Graham, who make a great pair; Robbie Gee and Lennie James, who also make a great pair; and specifically Brad Pitt as Mickey. Every Brad Pitt movie I see, he proves himself to me more and more as an actor--but this film really sealed the deal for me. Everyone is terrific in this one. The characters are tough and yet wimpy, and there is no definitive good or bad guy, which I really like.<br/><br/>3. The style and creativity. Honestly, from the moment I learned there was a character named Turkish in this movie (by far, the coolest character name I've ever heard), I knew I would think this was an awesome movie--so, from the first line, basically. And this hunch was confirmed by the sequence in which all of the characters are introduced. It's such a slick, stylish movie, and you can tell it's not trying too hard either.<br/><br/>4. The direction, cinematography, and editing. The reason I lumped these three together is because they work so well to complement each other. There are three examples of how well they work together: The diamond heist occurring across the security cameras; the sequence of all the characters being introduced; and the hare coursing scene. Even when I look at any of these scenes individually, I think, ""Wow! They're so stylish and well put-together. It's amazing."" And it really is. Guy Ritchie is, in my opinion as of now, a f***ing genius.<br/><br/>The only real complaints I can make about SNATCH are that the accents are really, really hard to understand. Although maybe they were made that way to add to the humor, which they certainly do. But I, for one, had to turn on the closed caption if I wanted to understand a bit of what they were saying. Also, there's so much going on and so many characters to keep track of that it can get confusing. I know a couple of details were lost on me, but repeated viewings fix this flaw.<br/><br/>I reserve perfect scores for films that really blow me away, and I don't have a problem giving a perfect score to SNATCH. After watching it, I just sat there shaking my head at how creative and well-done it is. It's an amazing heist movie. 10/10."

","Having seen Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels by the same writer/director, Guy Ritchie, and loved it, I very much looked forward to seeing this film.  While the story was different, the over all pacing, confrontations, and plot twists were very much the same.  It was if I had already seen it before.  Worth seeing nonetheless, especially if you haven't seen Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels."
"movieguy1021","8","2","5","12 June 2003"," Snatch.: 8/10
","In a recent issue of Premiere magazine, The Italian Job director F. Gary Gray called Snatch. the greatest heist movie ever. It has numerous twists and turns, and, like all good heist films, you don't know what's going to happen at the end. However, for Snatch., I had no idea what happened during the entire movie! Guy `Swept Away' Ritchie directed this snazzy, modern crime film, but isn't consistent all the way through.<br/><br/>Although it sounds like I didn't like the film, I did. A lot. What appealed to me was Ritchie's boldness to do weird camera tricks and shots. (Please keep in mind that I have not seen Ritchie's previous critically acclaimed work Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.) At times, mainly during the heist scene at the bank, shots were flipped upside down, and weird transitions were used. It looked really cool and modern. Also, despite the often voice-overs (usually by Jason Statham's Turkish), a quick and effective way of transition was used. It was used a few times, when characters were changing countries, and I really liked it. You'll recognize it.<br/><br/>In this convoluted script, which was also quite funny, Turkish tells us that he's under interrogation with his friend Tommy (Stephen Graham). He tells us of a diamond heist, with a group that includes famous robber Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro), and the subsequent hunt for the 84-karat diamond. Subplots include underground boxing, gypsies who you can't understand but look like Brad Pitt, and a dog that swallows a squeaky toy.<br/><br/>Even though I had no idea what was happening, who all of the characters were, what they were doing, and everything, I still really enjoyed Snatch. Why, I don't know, I just had a really good time trying to figure out what was happening on screen. Statham is a really good actor, not like Vin Diesel, who may be a good action star but can't act his way out of a paper bag (note to self: avoid clichÃ©s like the plague). All of the other characters just kind of `go along with the flow,' but I wish I did learn more about how everyone was connected. Other than that, Snatch. is a high-octane and extremely enjoyable heist movie that may not be the best ever, but is still really good.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for strong violence, language, and some nudity."
"mayur_goyal","Null","2","5","30 November 2002"," Fast paced and sometimes ridiculous events strung together with seemingly natural developments
","Lock, Stock ... and Snatch - these two masterpieces of Guy Ritchie have a common format: fast paced and sometimes ridiculous events strung together with seemingly natural developments. Both of these movies tend to explore the London underworld and they have made me believe that this underworld is really small - any action taken by any goon affects the whole scheme of things. With a plethora of characters, Guy Ritchie spins such a web of events that beyond a point of time, I stopped trying to remember the origin of any development and just soaked in the fast paced beauty of the current sequence - whether it is (black) comedy or gore or a music video on techno-beats. These movies have a very cynical tone - things never go the way they should, or, more correctly, the way the characters would like them to go. The resulting despair leads to more things going wrong until the whole mess of characters clears up with the help of enough bloodshed. Whether it is a squeaky ball eaten up by a mobster's dog resulting in a squeak whenever the dog tries to bark (Snatch) or a gangster making a totally one-sided deal with two street smart goons to steal antique guns (Lock, Stock .) or a self-confident pea-brained monster of a goon beaten up to death by a small gypsy (Snatch) or a whole gang of mobsters annihilated by a victim's drugged girlfriend who stumbles upon a machinegun (Lock, Stock .), the dry and dark humor inherent in almost every sequence makes these movies very different and interesting.<br/><br/>Both the movies have mostly British and talented ensemble of actors. Direction, film editing and presentation are very music-video-ish at times and that adds to the chic and youth nature of the movies.<br/><br/>These movies are recommended for those who a) want to indulge themselves with fast paced, dry and bloody comedy, or b) want to learns the tricks of the trade of London underworld"
"moviesmoviesmovies","10","2","5","11 April 2002"," More fun than Pulp Fiction
","What a film - interesting cuts & angles, great acting and snappy dialogue.<br/><br/>This film out does ""Pulp Fiction"" on many levels, but thanks to Tarantino for opening the genre.<br/><br/>Del Toro and Pitt are amazing."
"Robin Kelly","9","2","5","28 August 2000"," Blags, slags, lags and gags
","Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels was one of the most popular British films of all time and spawned a plethora of London gangster movies - all of them far inferior to their inspirer.  (And yes, I'm including Gangster No. 1 in that.) This has raised expectations for Guy Ritchie's Snatch inordinately.  And it doesn't disappoint. In fact it's probably an improvement.<br/><br/>However this is not a radical departure, in fact you get exactly the same elements but with a completely different story. So expect witty realistic dialogue, awesome cinematography, clever plotting, cool art direction, flash direction, dark humour. And violence. Lots of it.<br/><br/>The film centres on Turkish about to do a deal and he narrates the flashback to how he got there.  But just like Lock, Stock it isn't a simple journey. The breakneck pace and intricate plotting leaves little room for more than sketchy characterisation but that isn't a problem because at the very least you know the motivations for every single character and you believe them. One can only admire the juggling act required to keep so many characters and plots going and not drop a ball.  Guy Ritchie the brilliant screenwriter too often gets subsumed into Guy Ritchie the brilliant director. <br/><br/>
However let's get back to the violence.  Ritchie has been quoted as saying ""I disapprove of violence"" which is a touch disingenuous.  To be honest there were one or two points in the film where I felt a little uneasy.  It is the similar difficult balancing act which Lock, Stock - the film and the television series - tried to achieve where violence is both cartoon-like and realistic and it isn't always successful.  But the unease wasn't enough to stop me being swept along by the story.<br/><br/>While Brad Pitt and Vinnie Jones will be the actors most talked about, this is very much an ensemble piece - every actor does an excellent job and should not be overlooked.<br/><br/>In conclusion Snatch doesn't break new ground but it treads over old ground in a fresh, entertaining way.  And hopefully this will put an end to the London gangster movie for a while and not launch lots of crap imitations again."
"demented316","4","2","5","8 July 2001"," Best movie I have seen since the Usual Suspects.
","This movie has all the great things- Comedy, tragedy, drama, irony, revenge, extortion, murder, and a great soundtrack to boot.  I have to admit I didn't know what the hell was happening at times but the ending made it all worth while. This movie reminded me of The Usual Suspects, which is my favorite movie, so if you liked The Usual Suspects, you'll like this movie. Worth renting, if not buying, which I plan to do. Could have used a sexy female co-star, though. Could have used more of Benicio del Toro, also. Brad Pitt was great, Dennis Farina was great, and Vinnie Jones was excellent. Guy Ritchie proved himself to be a great director."
"onepotato2","3","4","14","3 January 2008"," cocky
","Snatch was perceived by me and my buddies at the time as unapologetically male entertainment. We were all on board with a movie like this that was a template for male behavior we might snag. There's barely even a minor female role in it. As male attributes are largely performed, maybe the movie would show us how it's done. We wouldn't have admitted that at the time, but I'm more comfortable with that now. <br/><br/>Guy Ritchie knows how to make a first movie that gets attention (and thus gets made), but one would have hoped he had better, more developed ideas about the 2nd; than to just duplicate the 1st movie; than troweling on style as anxiously and nervously as he does here, to disguise the fact that nothing's really going on. This movie's complexity doesn't reveal any more on ensuing viewings than it did on the 1st. It's complex for the sake of being complex. It's not really a film... it's just entertainment. Ritchie is obviously fond of these hoodlums in all their variety, and he makes us fond of them too; the self-assured, masculine Turkish, the vulnerable good guy Tommy. I loved watching Turkish and Tommy but their scenes don't add up to more than the sum of their parts, and that's the big problem with both of the movies (this and L.S. & B.) They're just a string of poorly-related conceits or 'features.'<br/><br/>Pitt is fine here as an unintelligible thug. And Ritchie HAS come up with a pretty loathsome villain, not the easiest thing to do; a low-class, mean S.O.B. in an enormous pair of glasses. He can mark that down as an achievement. The movie is a strong reminder that there really are people you do not want to meet in this life, despite Hollywoods tendency to paint villains in generalities and broad strokes.<br/><br/>The authors of Lucky Number Slevin (which you should see) obviously like this movie."

"julacislak","10","1","2","5 May 2020"," Simply a masterpiece
","The are Lock, Stock fans, there are Rocknrolla fans, and there are Sherlock Holmes fans. And yet, I think I won't lie when I say that most of Guy Ritchie's fans agree that Snatch is his best work. And I completely agree, this is my all time favourite and an absolute masterpiece. I can't say that Ritchie was the most diverse director during his early years, as there are many similarities to his debut movie, in almost all aspects. Despite that, the movie still feels new and original and most importantly, is highly enjoyable.<br/><br/>We face a classic Ritchie plot - many different storylines that eventually merge into one. We follow the adventures of England's crime world, from diamond dealers to small-time crooks. At the beginning we meet Tommy and Turkish, who could be perceived as the main characters. Still, just like in 'Lock, stock and two smoking barrels', every character is important, and if you stop paying attention you might miss a scene that is a key moment in the plot.<br/><br/>Another great thing about characters created by this ensemble cast (including Brad Pitt, Jason Statham and Benicio del Toro) is that every one of them is unique and has something to offer. In a story with so many characters, with a runtime of only 1h 45 mins, it's obvious that the screen time for every actor will be limited. And yet, we get to know a huge part of everyone's personality. Del Toro's Franky appears only in a couple of scenes, but is such a key character that without him the whole plot wouldn't make sense.<br/><br/>I also mentioned it in my 'Lock, stock' review, but Ritchie is a master when it comes to comedy. There's humor in almost every scene, but it's dark at times, and perfectly blends with the crime and action aspect of this movie. And to balance the experience, there are dramatic moments that add to the end result.<br/><br/>It's not a movie that will suit everyone's taste, but let's face it - such movie doesn't exist. But, if you're a fan of crime movies, action movies or comedies with a darker twist, this is the best you will get."

","I was tempted to give it 1/10, but I haven't given anything that low a score yet, and I wanted to avoid looking ingenuous. But seriously, this is as useless and pointless a movie as I have ever seen. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (Ritchies film before this one) was tolerable. Snatch is not. Alan Ford to be sure is quite good in the role of a psychotic gangster, and Statham and Graham are lovable. But everyone else is forgetable. Except for Pitt who is neither forgettable nor very good. The only thing worst then his performance is his Irish accent, which I can assure anyone who has not seen the film, is terrible. The only good part in the whole plot, is the final revenge that the gypsies take out on the gangsters. WARNING: The film contains animal cruelty both simulated, and not simulated."
"krational66","8","1","2","24 April 2020"," British black humor
","In a sense, the British sense of humor is very much like the weather in London, cold and damp, always a little obscure. It has been said that the British have a dry sense of humour, not because they do not laugh at their jokes, but because they love telling serious ones. As a result, the British have a bit of a rigid temperament and their sense of humor is always a little bit bashful, seems to be unable to break away from that bit of the so-called traditional reserved.
Guy Ritchie is a master of dark humor, and he's a bit of an outlier among British directors. His films are similar to quentin's in that they both have a strong sense of control over character cues and a dark sense of humor with exaggerated dialogue and plots and a bit of violence. It's a sense of humor that won't make you laugh, but will last forever.<br/><br/>The film opens with two seated men, Turk and his sidekick, jumping before they can say more, followed by a scene of a robbery by a group of outlandishly dressed men with fake beards. The comical poses themselves are full of humor, the clothes are full of guns and make people laugh, and the editing technique of the monitor shows the superb skill and creativity of the director.
The film then introduces all the characters one by one. On the one hand, it can be said that it is an explanation of the characters to the audience. On the other hand, it is like a show off by the director.
Indeed, the characters appear one by one, and always one leads up to the other. Although the film is always in a somewhat chaotic rhythm, the characters switch quickly, it will feel confused at first, because the audience needs time to figure out who is who, but the director is not confused at all, after watching the film, you will find that the director's thinking has been very careful and the story is always connected.<br/><br/>This is a story about diamonds. There are two main lines to the story.
First, the opening scene of the diamond thief four fingers frank took a giant diamond, he will take the diamond to New York to the boss ivy, but good gambling frank was scar Boris lured to the casino bet, Boris hired three gangsters to rob the casino and grab the diamond from frank's hands. Boris took the diamond and killed frank. Ivy couldn't wait for the diamond to fly from New York to London and hired Tony to help find the diamond. Although the diamond was finally found in the office of the gang, the diamond was a dog diao, random gun, ivy shot Tony.
On the other hand, the man named Turkey in the opening scene needs to find someone to fight in an underground boxing match, while the original fighter is beaten by gypsy mickey when he goes to buy a gypsy station wagon. Turkey can only ask mickey to do it for them, but mickey fails to fall in the fourth round as agreed to let local gang leader topp win money and nearly dies. Top discovered mickey's strength and asked him to play again. Mickey again failed to fall in the fourth round, but ivy was finally known by mickey's gypsy brothers.
The two main lines come together at the end. Turkey finds the dog that swallowed the diamond in the camp after the gypsies leave, and then goes back to the beginning of the film, where the man sitting opposite Turkey and tommy is ivy's man in London. Here the film comes to a screeched halt with the iconic quick cut of its third appearance. The audience is left with endless aftertaste.<br/><br/>A multi-threaded story is often a test of the director's skill. The film is a whole, and even if there are multiple threads, they must be combined together like DNA. The technique is not new. The characters are connected by chance encounters, and one pushes the other forward like dominoes, thus driving the story forward. And unlike pulp fiction story but leading role is a link between the change of tactics, the number of characters ""snatch"" more and there is no clear, primary and secondary story is complete, each group of meet the development of the plot fusion is very good, everyone is leading role, everyone have their own unique personality, so the audience can always see a group of crazy people performance and do not ignore any one.
Similarly, the director's excellent editing ability is also an important guarantee to master the multi-line story. Instead of a full-length editing game, the director USES only small clips to show his ability. There are four impressive:
One, lie in the echo of head tail. This technique is not uncommon, but this one is a little different, and the movie ends with a flashback to the opening scene that the audience still doesn't understand, until the old face of the diamond dealer appears and the film ends while the audience is still reminiscing.
Second, a pile-up of milk on the road. Take a look at each car and film what's happening to each of them. The director's editing is masterly, and this episode connects ivy's people to the mob, allowing the story to continue.
Third, ivy from the United States to the United Kingdom of rapid cutting. Closing the taxi door, taking the pills, Concorde, visa stamps, taxi lights on, it's pretty neat, pretty comic, and it sets the scene for the end of the movie.
Fourth, the dog chase rabbit and black fat taryn was hit cut together. On the one hand, it increases the comic effect of the film, on the other hand, it makes the film less bloody.<br/><br/>Guy is on the control have to surprise of the film, and at the same time, he doesn't focus on depicting a bloody scenes in the film, and in editing in dialogue with the actors in the story itself to represent black humor, therefore, even if the whole film is obscure dim, but what impress the audience is still the British cold black humor."

Statham, Gee, Pitt and Jones in particular, excellent. Then you have memorable characters like Brick Top, Boris the Blade and Tyrone as well. To compare it to Smoking Barrels, the story isn't as good and there maybe a few too many parties involved and definitely not the great ending that film has, but perhaps more likable characters and a few more laughs. Favourite moments include; the pawn shop fellas prior to robbing the bookies with Tyrone. Tyrone takes like a minute to be able to get out of his seat, as the getaway driver. What the f... can he get away from? Tyrone ends up getting them out of the jam and getting Franky and the diamond, hah.

","The brilliance of Snatch is its pure mayhem. No sentence is wasted, threat without menace, or decision without consequences. The ragtag cast of misfits, elite thieves, mercenary thugs and illegitimate jewellers all connect via a web of misdeeds and criminal activity, allowing the story to expertly weave several stories together over the course of under 2 hours. Narrated by the pseudo-lead character, a boxing promoter named Turkish (Jason Statham), the progress of a large diamond robbery is charted throughout the bowels of London, causing a chain-reaction of events to shake the crime world.<br/><br/>The cast is exemplary: Benicia Del Toro, Vinnie Jones and Dennis Farina are all central roles, and Brad Pitt even requested a role in the film, such is his admiration for Guy Ritchie's work. Bright characters populate the world, giving each actor more scope to really embody their roles. The quickness of the script makes every interaction biting and aggressive, with the potential for a fight to break out any second. Guy Ritchie's personal cinematic tropes are also on full display: quick-cuts, split screen frames and tracking shots are all used to maximum effectiveness, enhancing the quirkiness of every scene.<br/><br/>The story almost becomes a subsection of the film - the novelty of the experience itself and the crass British humour really makes Snatch special, with a well-written script merely promoting its excellence. This film also has a degree of rewatchability that most films of the genre would lose - especially in a comedic sense. Snatch is unapologetic in its execution, and well worth your time."

Starring a host of independent and mainstream(Brad Pitt) actors this British film is filled with humor- an absolute laugh riot with some amazing dialogues that will have you rolling and characters you will remember for months. Rooted in the London Underworld Snatch is about a stolen diamond and believe it or not- boxing. How these two come together is for you to see and judge. Great performances, tidy flow and expert direction makes Snatch a must watch."

","Mind you, I didn't hate this movie completely. There actually are some fun parts and a great performance by Brad Pitt. All the rest is a tiresome gangster comedy with little fantasy, mediocre dialogs and average to bad performances. While I usually defend Ritchie's bombastic style-over-substance philosophy, this time around he really bombed."

","""Snatch."": the tale of a stolen diamond, unlicensed boxing games, a promoter with the most peculiar hobby consisting on feeding his pigs with his enemies or debtors, and Irish travelers with caravans and accents as impenetrable as the plot that tries to tie all these elements together. <br/><br/>Oh, did I forget there's also a little dog that can swallow everything, from a squeaking toy to... a more valuable item. Well, I think this dog is the living metaphor of whatever Guy Ritchie expect from us, viewers: to swallow anything, as long as it is funny. In fact, the film is quite funny, with a few outbursts of sheer comedic genius, but it's not as easily digestible as Ritchie's 1998 hit: ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"".<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie has been accused of exercising in style with his second film, but he could also give the Hitchcock answer about style being only another name for self-plagiarism. And he wouldn't be totally wrong because ""Snatch."" can be looked as a plagiarism in tone and story structure of his 1998 hit film, same assortment of characters with colorful nicknames, same intertwined plots, same use of frenetic editing, slow, fast or stop motions, Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones and Tom Ford reprising different roles and a screenplay loaded of one-liners, quirks and wisecracks, though not as memorable as the first.So accusing Ritchie of the whole ""style over substance"" isn't just pointless, it's unfair in the way he didn't attend to do anything substantial, his ""Snatch."" Is as much a joke as ""Lock Stock"".<br/><br/>But he can't get away with this argument either, not totally. I saw the movie again and found myself amused most of the time, but never really riveted to the point that I would miss nothing from the film. It's like the style of Ritchie didn't allow the movie to bloom by itself, everything was more an excuse for a few throwaway gags and the character were only the foils of a deliriously intricate plot. A comedy where the focus is the story can afford slower moments, in the case of Ritchie's movies, it depends on who's on the screen and on that level, there are three characters steal the show.<br/><br/>Vinnie Jones, as Bullet Tooth Tony, provides a monologue that almost equals Dirty Harry's description of a Magnum, and with the same intimidating effect, Tom Ford as the nasty-looking bespectacled Brick Top is quite convincing as someone to make you curse your mother for giving you birth if you ever owed his money and Brad Pitt overplays his mumbling accent as if he was conscious that the whole thing didn't even need to be clear, a stunt that reminded me of Benicio Del Toro in ""The Usual Suspects"". That his 'Mickey' would make an accent worst than the cockney slang they used is a great running gag by itself, that with his extraordinary punching skills. Not to mention that Brad Pitt looked great, and you could tell, he still had the 'Fight Club' look.<br/><br/>Benicio Del Toro is another asset of the film, making a hilarious entrance as a pseudo Rabbi with an interesting lecture about the Virgin Mary... wait a minute, black-clad men walking together talking about 'Virgin'? A feeling of déjà-vu deepens. Anyway, Del Toro was great as Frank Four Fingers but wasted too soon. I guess he had to work for the movie that would earn him the Oscar the same year, the more serious ""Traffic"". The film has so many great and inventive characters, Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina) or Boris the Blade that not all of them have a real shining moment. Even Statham who has such amazing lines as ""Turkish"" in his first scenes becomes the passive observer he was in ""Lock"". Characters seem like the rather interchangeable elements of a plot too sophisticated for its own good. Even the build-up with unlicensed boxing games doesn't lead to a really satisfying resolution.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film for the most part of it, but thinking about it again, I'm wondering if it's not the sort of experience you can have as well by watching the best parts on Youtube. Ritchie rearranges all the moments like many clips of a parody series, and while it worked in ""Lock, Stock"" because it had a common thread, a major story-line... even the seemingly disjointed ""Reservoir Dogs"" had a plot. <br/><br/>In ""Snatch."", everyone is important enough for the story but not enough so that we care, it's funny and entertaining, but the film lacks structure. It is possible that Ritchie wanted to replicate his formula, with an all-American cast, and that was enough a novelty but maybe the detractors wished it was less than a replica, and more a Desert-Point-Eagle-type of film."

","Snatch seems to be one of those spunky British gangster films that critics are divided on, yet it's loved by the target audience. Guy Ritchie has done a Sam Raimi, he has remade the first film that put him on the cinematic map. Where Raimi remade The Evil Dead, and just called it Evil Dead II, Ritchie cheekily tries to get away with remaking Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and calling it Snatch. Sure the circumstances in plotting are different, and there's a big American star brought in to beef things up for the global market, but it's the same movie and without doubt it's lazy film making. But it still - like Evil Dead II - Rocks!<br/><br/>Snatch in story terms is concerned with a big diamond that stitches together a number of threads involving the London underworld. Some rough and tough Romany types join in the fun, headed by a purposely illegible Brad Pitt, while Dennis Farina, Benicio Del Toro and Rade Serbedzija add more cosmopolitan meat to the crooks and gangster stew. The British cement holding the building up comes in the twin forms of Jason Statham and Stephen Graham, with Vinnie Jones once again turning up to frighten the masses. Everything from bare knuckle fighting to bumbled robberies - to dog fighting and shifty arcade empires - are here, with Ritchie writing characterisations that positively boom off of the screen. <br/><br/>As with ""Lock-Stock"", the beauty is in the way violence and humour are deftly blended. Scenes are often bloody but also bloody funny, a pearl of dialogue is never far away from a perilous situation. The comic tone is more close to the knuckle here, Ritchie having fun toying with ethnic and machismo stereotypes, while he brings his bag of visual tricks before it got boring. The narrative is deliciously complex, but much credit to Ritchie for the way he pulls all the threads neatly together in a whirl of scene splicing and cocky literary assuredness.<br/><br/>So it's ""Lock-Stock 2"" then! No bad thing if you happen to be a fan of that sort of wide boy malarkey. If you don't like it? Then jog on sunshine. 8/10"

","Snatch is a film with a lot of brains. It's absolutely hilarious and it's incredibly smart. I think that just about all of the characters are awesome and all of the performances are fantastic. Brad Pitt sounds ridiculous as a gypsy, but is great. Jason Statham, who I don't like, is fantastic in this film. Denis Farnia is of course great in this film as he is in every film. Vinnie Jones, who i've only seen in X-Men: The Last stand(Unfortunately), is awesome in this movie. snatch is just a brilliant caper film. It's the perfect film with a fantastic ending that out shines the entire Ocean's trilogy. Though I really like those also. The Ocean's films are great, but Snatch is better. Funny that they both have Brad Pitt. The ending is funny and the film works really well. I can't wait to see RocknRolla, which is another Guy Ritchie film. Be sure to Snatch this film on DVD."

"Stampsfightclub","9","1","2","11 March 2009"," Thrilling crime drama that does Britain justice
","Thugs, smugglers, thieves and Gypsies all become involved in a diamond smuggling case.<br/><br/>British cinema. Sharp, issue driven and entertaining. Fact. So how does Snatch rank compared to all the greats surrounding it? Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, The Italian Job, Kidulthood and the Bond franchise are all memorable British crime hits that tell crime as it is with that cutting edge representation of the difficult British culture. Snatch is arguably one of the finest Brit Crime films eve created and with some thrilling performances and direction, it can sit highly among the British kings of cinema.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie takes that sharp format of dangerous gangster life and puts a riveting spin on it with some flowing and surprising direction. The opening montage with Jason Statham's narration is excellent as the camera zooms all over the scene and changes on a consistent basis without the viewer knowing what is really going on, which makes it almost humorous. Very artistic and almost simple, the direction is a consistent device that is properly used to tell a sharp story about diamond smuggling.<br/><br/>Encoded with too many characters to count, Snatch gives an intellectual look upon the British underground business. Written by Ritchie, we see his thoughts acclimate through diamond smuggling, unnoticeable boxing matches and a bizarre concept of murder (you will never look at pigs the same again). British cinema is all about issues as American cinema often shies away from being too in your face whereas Brits don't care and just do it, which is exactly what you want. Despite these heavy concepts of real life, this 2000 hit is often funny. Black comedy is often a questionable device in crime cinema particularly when it doesn't work (such as in Kidulthood) but all hail Ritchie who hits it spot on.<br/><br/>Plenty of blood, plenty of swearing this is a proper gangster film which isn't quite as sharp and understandable as Pulp Fiction but contains enough entertainment to be looked at in the same way.<br/><br/>Good performances all round particularly by Brad Pitt who seems to be able to play anything or anyone.<br/><br/>Snatch is all about the complicated story and where it isn't too clear as to what happens come the conclusion, it is evident that when you re-watch it again and again, you will always pick up more laughs, more thrills and learn something new."

","Snatch is a great movie. It is hilarious and had me laughing out loud several times. It is witty, fast paced, and well written. The characters are over the top, yet believable. The varying accents keep the viewer on her toes and add to the unique pace of the film. The story line is simple, but the characters are so intriguing. Pitt is exceptionally good in the film. His Romanian Gypsy accent is well done and believable and yet each line he delivers is funny simply because of the odd sounding accent. Another thing I loved about the film was how well thought out it was. Everything in frame has a purpose and a reason you're seeing it. The speed and pace of Snatch is hyper-kinetic and keeps the film moving quickly and allows the jigsaw puzzle like structure to play out perfectly. Snatch is a funny, witty, and all around amazing film that I highly recommend."
"Ellen_Addie","9","1","2","22 August 2008"," A movie that has it all
","First off, Snatch is an amazing movie in every sense of the word. There are very few movies made where the director obviously did not let one FRAME onto the screen without a reason, and Snatch is one of them. Nothing happens on screen without it having an effect on the plot. By now you know the plot, or plots. We follow a diamond-heist and the various characters trying to get theirs, at the same time following participants in an illegal boxing ring. The incredible part of the movie is how every scene ties in with the rest somehow, every character connects with the rest at least once. There are complaints that the movie is confusing, or muddled. There are a lot of things that they don't tell you (such as what the dog has to do with anything, but he's a VERY important character), and that's a good thing. Too many movies force feed the audience its plot points. Rather, we just watch occurrences, and have to piece together what ties everything together, the plot weaves together beautifully. The cinematography and performances are fantastic as well. Even the soundtrack is perfect. The camera style during the fight scenes (slowdown/stop/go) makes it difficult to stop watching, the sound effects fit in quietly in the background without being overwhelming. And it will be IMPOSSIBLE to watch this movie without repeating many of the lines around your friends. I found myself saying ""Zee Germans"" and things like ""It's not like he's a set of car keys, now is it?"" quite a bit. Naturally, Brad Pitt's pikey is one of the most outlandish I've ever seen."
"Dario_Gino","8","1","2","21 August 2008"," Terrific
","Obviously influenced by 'Pulp Fiction' but this is a brilliant and original film in its own right. Featuring a terrific cast of many known and not so known actors all creating a character that you will remember and be able to quote by the time the movie ends. That makes repeated viewings all the more fun. Also featuring a clever screenplay and a stylish and very creative direction from Guy Ritchie. Far, far surpassing his feature debut - 'Lock, Stock, & Two Smoking Barrels' - in almost every way imaginable. Here the deliciously absurd tone and painfully funny dark humor is spread throughout the entire film, which is where 'Lock, Stock' was thrown off balance. It tried to combine humorous elements with scenes that were just plain old grim. A superb array of interlinked characters who help the movie flow seamlessly. This is also Brad Pitt's finest hour in my opinion, despite being unintelligible for almost the whole film! You watch the film and your loyalties for the characters changes as the film progresses, basically wondering how it can work out OK for all the characters, you won't be disappointed by the ending though."
"kenjha","8","1","2","7 July 2008"," Jolly Good
","A hodgepodge of plot lines comprise this comedy about the low-lifes of London, featuring characters such as ""Franky Four Fingers"" and ""Boris the Blade."" Ritchie's followup to ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is far superior because he has much better script to work with. As with the earlier film, Ritchie goes a little overboard with his hyperactive camera-work, but is not as distracting because of the amusing situations and funny dialog. The running joke is that nobody can understand boxer Pitt's Irish Gypsy accent; ironically, to those outside Britain, it is hard to understand what most of the characters are saying. Thank heavens for subtitles."

I've never seen anything like this, and the soundtrack is very good, it fits right in the environment of the movie. This movie doesn't leave you sad, it leaves you thinking, and in a good mood.

"natedog54","9","1","2","20 November 2007"," Snatch this one up.
","Turkish (Jason Stathem) is a struggling boxing promoter who just wants to earn a living promoting boxing. He and his wanna be tough friend, Tommy (Stephan Graham), find out the hard way that certain people should not be dealt with if you want to stay out of trouble. Two of the people they find out who shouldn't be messed with is, One Punch Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), and one boxing promoter/ Kingpin, Brick Top (Alan Ford). Turkish and Tommy end up dealing with these two characters and realize that there is so much more to them then meets the eye. Mean while there is a huge diamond that has been stolen and every gangster and mob man wants it. This adds a whole big twist in lives of not only local gangsters and mob men, but also local jewelers and thieves. While Turkish and Tommy end up trying to deal with their new ""friends"", the whole rest of the gangster community fights over the diamond. Though out the whole movie the diamond changes hands and in the end, it ends up with the most unlikely character.<br/><br/>This movie had great potential and came through. It was a great action comedy that kept me glued to the screen. It had everything from Fights to Shootings, to people getting limbs chopped off. Great, I know. The comedy that went with it was something that of a man getting hit in the privates. You know you shouldn't laugh but it was so hard not to. It was mostly dark humor, dealing with death and violence so you kind of feel bad for laughing but they set it up in a way were it worked.<br/><br/>The British dialect was a bit hard to follow at the beginning, but after a while you get used to it. It was definitely one of those movies that you would have to watch again just so you could catch every thing that was said. The hardest character to understand would have to be Brad Pitts. They do this on purpose because he is supposed to be a non-educated gypsy that no one can understand, but again as the movie digresses you start to learn the dialect and get to love his character.<br/><br/>This movie had lots and lots of characters, but seemed to keep them under control. It reminded me of the movie ""smoking aces"", in the fact that there were many characters. Almost too many in the beginning but the movie did a great job of either killing them off, or just kind of pushing them aside and you forgetting about them. It also jumped around a lot. They would go from character to character and not give a lead to the scene change. I some what enjoyed this part of the movie but others could very easily get lost.<br/><br/>The narrating part done by Jason Stathem really did add something to the movie. He has played in other movies were he has played the bad ass that beats everyone up. In this role he really does show that he can actually act. I am a big fan of the starting a movie at the end of a movie and the narrator going back trough and telling you how they got to were they were. I think when directors do this they always have a great way to end the movie. In this movie they definitely pulled it off.<br/><br/>So I would have to say you would really enjoy this movie if you don't mind the dark humor with violence. If you love stories were there really is no really clear cut good guy. It doesn't end like you thought it would and tons of big guns and people getting what they deserve, you should definitely ""Snatch"" up this movie."
"refresh_daemon","7","1","2","27 August 2007"," Sometimes over-the-top, but generally entertaining
","This film starts out, after a brief stylish introduction, with a TV-like introduction sequence that lists all the characters by their nickname in flashy stylish manner and for much of the film, keeps with its flash. But for all of its fast-cutting, special-effect-happy direction and montage, there's still a decent semi-comedic caper film in there at the same time and that keeps Snatch from falling into the pit of being all looks and no substance.<br/><br/>Most of the characters are really one note, which is fine because the cast is enormous. The humor is very British (not surprisingly) but also broad enough that most audiences should be able to pick it up. As for the story, it's basically a story about dumb luck and a lot of it during a series on crimes that all lead to people dying, winning or losing, whether by fortune, misfortune, or in some cases, actual planning. The worst of the baddies get their due. The least bad of the baddies, sometimes get away, like in all straight caper films.<br/><br/>The over-the-top style of the film is a little distracting at times and I often wanted writer-director Guy Ritchie to settle down at times because it was detracting from my ability to coherently follow the story, but sometimes the inserts, cuts and camera tricks added value to the humor and the situations (my favorite being the Franky Four Fingers still inserts). Being the only Ritchie film I've seen, I don't have much to compare it to, but I'm hoping that he's learned more discipline in knowing when to apply his tricks and when to hold back and let his writing do the work.<br/><br/>It's not a very complicated film, but it does its job well as a fun caper film and it doesn't really aim to be a whole lot more than that. So I say it's an enjoyable way to spend an evening. 7/10."

","I thought this film was very funny, but I would not say it was a great movie. I really really enjoyed it and it employed a lot very neat directing tricks. I like how some characters had their distinct camera style and it was pulled off well. Surprisingly one of the weaker performances I thought was Del Toro's, who is usually one of my favorite actors and some of the no names did extremely well. They are only no names in my book, but they may be established in English cinema. I loved some of the characters and every one of them was unique in their own way, but added a lot to it. I loved Brick Top. This maybe be sad, but after Seven and Fight Club this is the only movie that I don't hate Brad Pitt as an actor. He held his own in this movie. I loved how the movie ended and the ""good guys"" getting away with the diamond. I loved the heist at the beginning and thought it was so well done. That is about it. I don't think I would watch it again, unless to get someone else to watch this. I should also mention this is my second time watching it, but I did not remember anything about it except that is was very funny."

","""Snatch"" is really just the same as ""Lock,Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", only here, the clever dialogues are replaced by f-words. If I want to hear the f-word 153 times, I'll just call a Detroit tech support. So once again, a bunch of criminals get themselves into the most standard situations available, like being in debt with Harry the Hatchet uhm, Brick Top, stealing diamonds (where would he get that from?), betting on illegal boxing matches etc. It's pretty obvious the only crime Guy Ritchie has ever witnessed is when Madonna gets her pay. Obviously, everybody needs nicknames again, Boris the Blade (he has nothing to do with blades but hey, it's an alliteration), Frankie Four Fingers, Doug The Head, you get how it works by now. Obviously the movie is still quite good because it's so like Tarantino that you can't help enjoying yourself and I suppose it's Guy Ritchie's specialty (I'm not saying it's great, I'm saying I've seen ""Swept Away"").

","""Snatch"" is a movie that takes a little patience to get into. The first 15-20 minutes are a bit confusing. There are a lot of characters to introduce, and Ritchie's fitful editing style - reminiscent of music video-style flash - is something the viewer will have to get used to. But once it settles down and we get into the flow of it, it is a very entertaining, even hilarious, movie. Brad Pitt does a superb job and shows once more why he is not only a big star but a fine actor. All the actors in this are excellent. It's a film about confusion, dumb plots, and drastic mistakes made by people who think they're smart when really they are all dumb as lamp posts. <br/><br/>This movie is made with real flair and an ear for ""talk."" I would suggest watching it with English SUBTITLES ON. This is the great innovation of DVD and it makes the picture a bit more coherent. There is a section when Pitt delivers one of his prodigious mumbles that the subtitles simply give up. It is actually totally invented by Pitt. Don't worry if you aren't getting it all the first time you see it. It's really a small tour de force by Ritchie and needs to be seen at least twice to get the full effect."

Brad Pitt, Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones, ... Everyone rocked the show! The scene in the bar with Vinnie Jones and the three masked blacks was THE SCENE of the movie. Vinnie Jones did a similar role to the one in LSATSB but gives it a new freshness that doesn't let you get bored of him. Brad Pitt really impressed with the Pikey accent. Way to go Guy Ritchie.

Nobody understands Mickey. Brick Top is simply furious all the time. Tony switches rage on and off like the light. Frankie is as lucky in crime as he is unlucky in gambling. Sol, Vinny and Tyrone try to be gangsters. Avi can't stand England. Doug is dying to be Jewish. Thommy does what he can to support Turkish. And nobody likes the guys who live in the camp side. <br/><br/>Now put all of them in a pond, throw in a 84 carat diamond and you bet, the result is gonna be one hell of entertainment.

Snatch is all about two guys who are involved in illegal boxing and one day they decide to buy a new caravan and all of a sudden it turns into a rip-roaring ride of hilarity which is full of revenge, back stabbing and downright stupidity. The cast is great (even though there are sooooooo many characters), the plot can be a bit confusing but it doesn't matter because it's funny.

","Did anybody out there prefer Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels? Although I, myself, am a big fan of Benicio Del Toro, and Brad Pitt was excellent, I thought the predecessor had a slightly more raw quality to it, as it was not quite as polished off as the Hollywood version.<br/><br/>Albeit, Snatch may well have been funnier, but I'm always one to tip my hat to that which presented the really original idea in the first place. Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels was absolutely its own thing, and therefore gets extra points from me. And seriously, nobody beats Sting. And I also thought Vinnie Jones' character had an extra irony to it when he was always trying to set a good example for his son while beating in people's brains. Also, that ending scene to LSTSB was terrific.<br/><br/>A lot of what made Snatch so great was the cinematography, but a lot of that was directly taken from LSTSB, as was the juxtaposition of subject matter and music."

","I must first admit that I've seen this film close to 20 times. I never get tired of seeing it (I'm starting to understand pikey!!). The characters are memorable, the script un-Hollywood, the humour sharp, and the directorial genius of Guy Ritchie is evident. There are slow motion shots, split-screens, and all kinds of other orthodox film-making techniques. These, together with beautifully written dialogues, great performances (Especially Del Toro, Farina, Ford, Pitt, Graham....I could go on forever), and the great integration of different story lines come together to make one helluva flick. Well done Mr Ritchie (or is that Mr Madonna??? heck, I'll just call you Susan if you want!) Having seen both Lock, stock....and Snatch, I'd say snatch just takes it at the finish, literally."

","Snatch is a surprisingly entertaining comedy/action movie, with oodles of dismemberments, shoot-outs and heists (all in good fun, of course)! Even with the red stuff flowing on the screen, it never loses its sense of humor, and is more goofy than disturbing. Pitt's character is hilarious, the intertwining stories are fun to watch, and Guy Ritchie is da man! Imagine 'Pulp Fiction' with diamonds, and you'll get the idea. It's been a while since I've watched ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,"" but now I have a sudden urge to rent it again. A lot of crime comedies are boring and unoriginal, but Snatch was entertaining throughout, and quite humorous. Give it a shot if you like Tarantino-esquire schtuff."

","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br/><br/>Guy Ritchie's follow-up to Lock, Stock opens with Turkish (Jason Statham) and Tommy (Stephen Graham) two unlicensed boxing promoters getting roped into rigging a bare-knuckle fight with feared local kingpin Brick Top (Alan Ford.) They find a contender in the shape of loose-cannon Irish gypsy One Punch Mickey O' Neill (Brad Pitt) who doesn't play up to his part of the deal, setting off a violent chain of events. Juxtaposed with this story is one of a diamond thief and gambling addict called Frankie Four Fingers (Bencio Del Toro) who has gone missing in London. Interested in finding him is American head honcho Avi (Dennis Farina) who enlists the help of feared local goon Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) a hard-man with an inexplicable love of Madonna's hit single Starlight. These are just some of the crazy characters that fall into this crazy equation.<br/><br/>I went out my way to see Lock, Stock when it was released a few years earlier, so why I've waited this long to finally see Snatch for the first time I don't know but now I have, as well as seeing the other non Ritchie Brit gangster flick Layer Cake a few years ago. Having seen it, I'm surprised actually how this ended up with an 18 and Layer Cake was awarded a 15, despite the violence actually being considerably worse in that film. Sure, there is a scene where a guy blows his brains out and we see a load of blood splatter on the wall, but to a sensitive 15 year old, that could just be explained as a tin of paint exploding, as opposed to the actual blood laden shootings we do see in Layer Cake. There's also the big hand chopping scene I'd been built up to in this film but that turned out to be a big non event.<br/><br/>As for the actual quality of the film itself, we do have a very impressive gangster film on our hands here, with very intricate characters in a very intricate story. A lot of Brit gangster films get accused of trying to copy American films like Goodfellas or the Godfather movies, but Pitt himself wanted a role in this. As well as him, the film has a whole colourful cast of recognizable faces.<br/><br/>Despite all the swearing and violence going on, the film somehow manages to maintain a very light-hearted tone through-out, with some very funny characters in the shape of the incompetent black yardies (and their dog!) It's a slick, classy gangster movie (and, in case you can't tell, I liked the song at the end!) ****"
"walter-126","10","1","2","5 February 2006"," Brilliant from start to finish
","Once in a while you encounter a movie which rings no bells and rises no expectations. You just sit and watch it hoping it won't suck. Snatch, to me, was one of those movies and BOY have I enjoyed it. Sure ... it's violent but I like that sometimes.<br/><br/>This movie has an excellent plot, trend setting camera-work and editing, a multitude of brilliant actors doing even better acting, several compelling stories asynchronously intertwining and above all ... large chunks of well placed humor. The only thing that lacks in this movie (thank God) is romance.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie are very believable caricatures of people that, all in their own way, live life avoiding the law. In Snatch these characters (with hilarious nick names) get to develop fully since the law doesn't show itself until the very last moments of the movie. Until that time theft, murder, betrayal, brotherhood, fighting but above all British humor roam freely through the story.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt does what he does best in this movie and entertains the audience with a masterpiece of acting. Vinnie Jones establishes himself as an icon almost equal to Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) in Pulp Fiction. Jason Statham does his most enjoyable acting ever. I could rave on about this movie but if you haven't seen it and you really like an action-packed knockout from the unexpected corner; watch this one!"
"raymond-98","10","1","2","18 January 2006"," Very South East London gangster reality!
","Following Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels would have been no easy task without the input of Brad Pitt. However he obviously saw the potential of this film and, I believe, offered his services for next to nothing. Having said that it was an enormous risk to star an American actor in the role of such a strangely particular person as ""The Pikey"" and I am so impressed with Richie's bravery and Pitt's abilities. The editing of the film is such an incredibly cohesive representation of the reality it seeks to portray. The violent and comically black survival humor it depicts, along with the adrenaline rush of street lunacy it encompasses was and is about as accurate as you can get. Life as it is for those who want to be upwardly mobile at the hard end of London. What's more I am a Pikey!<br/><br/>The only caveat would be, subtitles for the rest of the Planet."

","If you haven't seen this film yet then go and rent it now. It is a must see for anyone with a good taste in films. I know that people's opinions are supposed to be just that; opinions. But this film is just brilliant. Fact. I can't understand how you can't like this film. Perhaps the accents will be a bit too much for Americans. I remember seeing an episode of Ripleys Believe It Or Not in which they used subtitles for an interview with an English woman. So I'm thinking that the Americans might have a bit of issue with the English accent. But it shouldn't be that much of a problem. While we're on this subject I have to say that Brad Pitt absolutely butchered the Irish accent but its OK because it was funny as hell. The only other problem I can think of that people may have with Snatch is the violence. It doesn't bother me in the slightest but I guess that some could be put of by it. Even if you don't like violence in movies I would still recommend that you see it, give it a try. In conclusion this film is hilarious and has a great story with many unsuspected twists. If you don't see Snatch you will regret it. Trust me, watch this film NOW"

","I haven't seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, which makes this the first Guy Ritchie film I've seen, and the only one I've seen so far. I had heard plenty of good things about this film, and I do believe that I've seen some of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels(though that didn't impress me much, actually), and after seeing some advertisements for this, I was looking forward to seeing it. I must say, it did meet my expectations, though it didn't exceed them. The plot is great, very interesting and constantly developing. It also has a good pace, you're never bored, which can also be attributed to the many quick cuts and great editing. The acting is great, I really enjoyed Brad Pitt and Vinnie Jones, not to mention Jason Statham, though they were all great, I think. The characters were diverse, well-written and credible, not to mention quite entertaining, though at times they became a little lame, in obvious attempts at humor. The action is great, though there is fairly little of it; it's mostly sacrificed for the sake of more humor. Don't get me wrong, the humor is mostly good too, but sometimes it just seems like there is too little action in it, though, when there is action, it's good. The camera work and overall filming style is, well, stylish, and looks very cool. I liked the use of slow-motion, fast-motion and instantly changing angles, not to mention the well-placed quick cuts. The way the diamond constantly changed hands in the film was great, though a fairly basic way to keep the plot going. I liked all of the things that didn't have anything to do with the diamond, like the gypsies and the boxing, but I did think the plot revolved a little too much around the diamond. All in all, a very entertaining film, that couldn't have been much better or much more professionally made, but was lacking a little. I recommend it to fans of British/violent humor, and fans of the actors. I guess people who liked Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels will enjoy this too, though I can't say for sure, as I haven't seen it. 8/10"

","What an excellent film, I personally think it is better than Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (which is also superb!).<br/><br/>People (majority of Americans) slate this movie saying it is a complete Pulp Fiction rip-off. This is rubbish, Pulp Fiction flitters between storylines, like Snatch does, but in a different time order. For example Vincent and Julius in the cafe being the final scene, but in the scene before Butch killed Vincent. Snatch does focuses upon storylines of a certain number of people, but does not flitter between time.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt puts in a great performance here, one of his best ever. Yes you can't always understand what he says, but that is part of his character being a 'pikey'. <br/><br/>An extremely funny and clever film deserves its place in the IMDb top 250 despite what some people say!"

","If you find 'Snatch' confusing, just come and live in my area for a month - it will all fall into place very quickly! When I heard that Brad Pitt had been cast as the pikey boxer, I groaned inwardly - Yanks telling us how to live our lives again! But no, he is brilliant. He has it down pat. He is just dirty enough, dishonest enough and unintelligible enough to make you think he really is a pikey! I was equally impressed with the rest of the cast - sterling performances all round! Considering Ritchie is an old Harrovian and has lived his life just about as far away as you can get from the world of the itinerant pikeys, he recreated their world to perfection. Well done!<br/><br/>I can well understand that many of you out there in the wide world would have found the dialogue almost completely incomprehensible but all praise to the director. He has sacrificed clarity for realism and come out on top. The plot, of course, is total nonsense but, so what, it's not a documentary, is it? The film has plenty of plusses. Loads of action, gratuitous violence galore, a rollicking pace and pretty (non) exotic locations.<br/><br/>I really liked it and thought it owed only a little to 'Lock Stock' which I liked equally well.

"abknor","5","1","2","3 August 2003"," confusing mix
","There are movies such as The Quick and the Dead and basically anything that Tarantino has done that portray rock hard scum as real heroes, in which the viewer's sense of justice and morality is pacified in the end by killing off the 'heroes'. Then there are the movies that try to appeal to the wannabe intellectuals by using intricate plot and editing devices, such as Lola Rennt. Snatch is a mixture of both and should therefore appeal to both the people who view the first category of film as a director's easy way out, and to those who find the latter boring.<br/><br/>And it would have worked too, had the story not been too simplistic and the telling too confusing. It took me a while to figure out who was who and by then the movie was almost over. Maybe I'll like it better after a second viewing, but from what I saw, a second viewing is not in the cards. Still a pretty good rental, though, just don't expect a top movie."

","This is seriously one of the best movies I've ever seen.  In my opinion it is WAY better than Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.  All the characters are developed and explained well and no two are the same.  I actually felt emotion for the main characters, unlike in Lock, Stock.. and I loved all the characters a lot more.  (Dennis Farina is the BEST.)<br/><br/>While watching this movie I was constantly wondering what Ritchie was going to come up with next and I wondered that until the last frame.  This is also one of the funniest movies I've ever seen because of the way the movie takes its comedy so seriously.  The comic moments are real and not designed to make you laugh on purpose, unlike most comedies.  You laugh about other people's misfortunes and the way they meet their demise and if a movie can do that; it's a winner in my book.  The only character that I didn't laugh at when they got theirs was Brick Top and that was because he was the only non-funny character. (I also love the ""making fun if other people's accents"" humor... and the ENGLISH English language is funny no matter what they say.)<br/><br/>9/10 and possibly more if I didn't have such a high standard for movies.

","Snatch has a convoluted and preposterous plot. It's also full of dreadful London gangster stereotypes. But this isn't going to be a negative review. In fact, Snatch is a hugely enjoyable film. It's very dynamic, and a marked improvement on Ritchie's previous Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, which certainly had its moments too. Snatch is full of memorable lines and great humor. The editing and direction keeps the film moving at a cracking pace, and there's always something happening so it never drags. It possesses a great soundtrack, and excellent performances from an eclectic selection of colorful characters: Alan Ford's 'Brick Top' has to be one of the most despicable yet highly amusing gangster characters ever to grace the silver screen. Worth noting too is the excellent presentation and content of the Region 1 DVD release. Just remember to beware of 'ze Germans', and don't expect too much substance, but enjoy the style and great escapism that Snatch offers."
"macsroyal","Null","1","2","14 October 2002"," Know what you are in for...
","Snatch is a good movie!  The dialogue between the character is some of the most dynamic I have heard in a long time.<br/><br/>However, I do feel sorry for the poor sap who rents this movie with no preconceived notion of what the movie is about or whether it is comedy or drama.  Snatch is the type of movie that shocks you from the opening scene. Not by the violence, but by the interlocking twists and turns of the characters involved.<br/><br/>NO doubt, this is a hilarious comedy.<br/><br/>Many have described the plot as complicated, thin, or even irrelevant.<br/><br/>After my second viewing (I required two viewings just to make sure I could remember who was who and who said what), I realized that the plot is solid and an integral part of the movie.<br/><br/>A group of crooks dressed up as stereotyped Jews steal a huge diamond.  The diamond is brought to London.  Then (at least) 5 sub plots occur during the movie:  There is Russian mobster Boris 'The Blade' Yurinov who attempts to secure the diamond.  There is an American mobster Cousin Abraham 'Avi' Denovitz who comes to London in an effort to secure the diamond.  There are 3 black petty thieves who are hired to secure the diamond.  There is 'Brick Top' Polford - a gangster boxing promoter who later finds out about the diamond, and finally there is Turkish, the narrator of the movie, and his buddy Tommy who are in deep s**t with the boxing promoter and they know nothing about the diamond...BUT....<br/><br/>I will stop right there.<br/><br/>It is obvious that Pulp Fiction played a MAJOR influence on this movie. The plot(s) go in various directions, are often out of sequence, and then come full circle at the end. This is not an insult to Guy Ritchie for using Pulp Fiction as an influence.  After all, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery<br/><br/>What makes this movie so good is the dialogue.  My personal favorite characters were the 3 black thieves AND their dog.  No point quoting them here because their thick English accents and the nature of their dialogue are necessary to put the humor over the top.  I never laughed so hard at dog and his squeaky toy.  Priceless!<br/><br/>I will admit, from a realistic standpoint, there were several things that bothered me about this move.  The biggest problem was the non stop shooting of guns in public places, city streets, and no one notices or even cares? In one scene, Bullet Tooth Tony enters a pub, orders a dark beer, sits at a table and proceeds to pull out his gun and describe it to the thieves.  Five minutes later he empties no less than two clips inside the bar, and no one notices????  <br/><br/>I know, I know, I am nitpicking.  Perhaps Guy Ritchie addresses this issue by having the police show up in full force at the end of the movie.  Don't worry, that wasn't really a spoiler as they aren't really relevant.<br/><br/>As I said, this is a good movie.  I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Now you know what you are in for!"

It's very entertaining to watch all the different characters interact with each other as they all bumble their way around. Even though the all star cast of Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro and Dennis Farina, it is Vinnie Jones as Bullet Tooth Tony who shines. Jones is the ultimate bad ass, I could watch this guy all day he is just amazing and hilarious. Pitt is also very funny as a boxer who is very hard to understand. There are many very funny scenes in here, one of the best is when the three black guys try to hold up Tony with fake guns.

When I finally saw the film, that's exactly what I got; I was hit in the face with a 400lb gorilla of wildly entertaining fun right from the start.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's character, Micky, is extremely well written and very well played.  Dennis Farina hasn't been this good in years; it was like the part of Avi was written just for him.  This may sound a bit on the wild side, but the dog's scenes were some of the best in the film.  It's almost as if he had a humans brain, and could take acting cues right along with the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>Richie has managed to balance the entire cast nearly perfectly; no one character dominates the screen.  This is evident even in the plot(or should I say plots).  Many times when a film tries to balance two plots, there's always one that stands out in your mind.  This isn't the case with ""Snatch"". The main plot and sub-plot mesh together perfectly, without one overpowering the other.<br/><br/>It's not the greatest film to ever grace the big screen, but with the superb writing, the monstrous acting, and the fast-paced flow, ""Snatch"" will be one of the year's big hits.

","It's too bad I was feeling like a space cadette from bronchitis when I saw Snatch because I missed a few of the key jokes (or maybe it was due to the variety of british accents). At least I was consistently stunned visually. I have to hand it to Guy Ritchie for putting together a story that is completely discombobulated in its presentation and yet comes full circle. Not to mention that this is twice in a row that he's put together a good movie (keep in mind that not everyone likes a fast cut, semi nautious approach to film making). The story of a jewelry heist is classic, but the characters set this one apart (just take a look at their names and you'll understand what I mean). The casting was great; a subtle blend of big names and not so big names, each performance outdoing the other (and keep in mind that this is a comedy). It's hard to pick a favorite character, but I  make it a tie between Turkish (our friendly narrator) and One Punch Mickey O'Neil (the gypsy boxer played by Brad Pitt, who mind you is excellent although incomprehensible at times). I definitively recommend this movie to people who enjoyed Ritchie's last movie, but you'll probably need to see it twice if you want to understand everything that's said."

","The British film industry is lucky.  Guy Ritchie doesn't like flying!<br/><br/>The main criticism I'd heard regarding this film was that it was just more of the same from its predecessor Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  Well I'd rather have a Lock Stock'2 than the 50 Runaway Brides that Hollywood deems worthy to force upon us each year!<br/><br/>Of course it is impossible to avoid comparisons with Ritchie's remarkable debut.  The trademarks are all here - the larger than life criminal underworlders (including more racial stereotypes than all the Bond films put together), the far-fetched farcical plot, and the comicbook violence. However, Snatch is an altogether darker, harder tonic to swallow. <br/><br/>
While Snatch may be a lot darker in tone, with hard edged depictions of life in the depths of the criminal underworld (most notably the dog-fighting), it still delivers plenty of punch in its comedy.  The cast all seem to thoroughly enjoy their roles (most of which are pretty much straightforward cameos) with Brad Pitt perhaps steeling the show with his spot on coherently-challenged Gypsy boxer.<br/><br/>Snatch is a brutally stylish, wickedly enjoyable British gangster film. More of the same then!"

To answer simply: no he couldn't.<br/><br/>Snatch is a good, slick film but it lacks something. Maybe it's originality? Very similar to Lock Stock - different storylines weave and turn crossing each other's paths in unexpected twists, but this time maybe we're expecting them?<br/><br/>It lacks flow, it tends to stop and start. We end up talking about the 'good' bits instead of the film as a whole.<br/><br/>The direction is good, Brad Pitt is excellent [it hurts me to say], the soundtrack is definitely worth buying and the majority of the acting is very good.<br/><br/>Snatch [7/10] is definitely worth seeing but know you're pretty much getting more of the same... and if you haven't seen Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels yet see that instead!"

It's so damned full of life, so flamboyant, so fast paced, so wild, so full of rich characters -- I know I'll watch this at least two more times, and I NEVER do that.<br/><br/>On the down side, it's one of those movies that has *alot* of characters, and a real multi-tentacled plot, and it does involve a stolen diamond (but there's no people in black suits on wires avoiding laser beams I assure you). There's an evil guy in here about 65 called Brick Top who looks like your grandfather but he's got this eye that just roves around. Damn this is a good movie. Brad Pitt is even more amusing here than he was in Fight Club, and he's just a secondary character.

","""Snatch"" has proven director Guy Ritchie to be the British Quentin Tarantino.  This movie is bloody and violent, but still funny and exciting. I loved Brad Pitt as One-Punch Mickey, the mush-mouthed Irish gypsy.  Other enjoyable characters are Sol, Vinnie and Tyrone, the hapless pawn shop gangsters, Avi, the brash New York diamond merchant, and Brick Top, the baddest movie villain as ever tossed an unlucky soul to the pigs.  The plot is very complicated and elaborate, as evidenced by the sequences leading up to Boris the Blade getting run over.  But in this cool movie, all you need to do is get lost in the music and flashy visuals."
"mentalcritic","Null","1","2","21 December 2001"," Ritchie shows up Tarantino once again...
","Funny and entertaining from start to finish, Snatch once again shows that an American who can't stop verbally masturbating is no match for an Englishman who doesn't take himself so damned seriously. Just as an indicator of how good the script in Snatch is, it convinced Brad Pitt to do the film for much less than his normal tens-of-millions fee, something you never see in Hollywood these days.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt also manages to convince the audience that he is a far better actor than anyone who has appeared in a Tarantino film. Just seeing him put on a ""pikey"" accent less than a year after taking on one of 1999's most difficult roles in Fight Club has definitely changed my mind about his acting skills. This man could really go places if he keeps it up. Jason Statham and the rest of the Lock-Stock-Gang put in riveting performances as boxing promoters or pikeys, and Vinnie Jones is his usual thuggish self. However, unlike certain other films in which actors play thugs, these actors are convincing. How many of the actors in Reservoir Dogs have ever even strode onto a football field, leave alone been sent off as many times as Vinnie?<br/><br/>Alan Ford also demonstrates another thing Ritchie's films have over those of Tarantino: subtlety. Compare the scene in which Ford's character explains his position in the underworld to the jewellery store men with anything Tarantino has put on screen of a similar nature and you'll see what I mean. This sequence is funny, driving, and straight to the point with full convincingness.<br/><br/>All in all, I give Snatch ten out of ten just for being a REAL gangster film."

","If you have seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels than you will know what to expect from writer/director Guy Ritchie's latest gangster flick.  The plot revolves around a stolen diamond and involves a rigged boxing mach, a group of hapless crooks, and a dog that can swallow just about any thing. Most of the cast in Snatch was present in Lock Stock and features great performances from British actors that are practically unknown in North America.  The exception to this is the film's big American star Brad Pitt, who is quite funny as an Irish/English gypsy with an accent that no one can seem to understand.  When Lock Stock came out Guy Ritchie was immediately compared to Quentin Tarantino, and with Snatch that seems even more evident. In a sense Snatch is like Tarantino's Jackie Brown, not as edgy or bloody as his previous but more mature with a greater focus on plot and characters. I don't know whether I liked this better than Lock Stock or not, they are both very entertaining films and I gave them both 4 stars, but if you could only see one, see Snatch its a fun movie."

","*Please note that I do not feel I have given any of the important or ""good bits"" away in my review, but I do have a lot of detail in it, so if you are into watching movies without details about them beforehand (wait...why are you reading reviews then ??), then you might want to skip this one !*<br/><br/>I've never seen such an eclectic group of actors, as well as characters, that worked so well together.  Snatch brings together Hollywood major-leaguers Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro, and Dennis Farina and throws them into an off the wall British comedy with hilarious results.<br/><br/>Loosely, Snatch is about a diamond heist, gone horribly wrong.<br/><br/>Frankie Four Fingers (del Toro) and friends pose as Hasidic Jews to steal an 84 carat diamond in Antwerp.  The plan is for Frankie to take the diamond back to New York (via a stopover in London) and give it to Avi (Farina).<br/><br/>However, he is waylaid in London by Boris the Blade, whom he goes to for a gun. Boris is tipped off by one of Frankie's collaborators (who just happens to be Boris's brother) about the stone, and about Frankie's gambling addiction (how do you think he came to be minus a finger ?).  Boris devises a plan to get the diamond for himself.<br/><br/>Enter a slew of characters that are as hilarious as they are diverse:<br/><br/>Sol (Lennie James) and Vinnie (Robbie Gee), petty thieves running a not-entirely-reputable pawn shop, and their oversized getaway driver (`What the hell can he get away from ?' Vinnie asks Sol at one point) Tyrone (newcomer Ade);  Brick Top (Alan Ford),  a vicious modern day gangster that arranges (and rigs) all kinds of illegal fights (of both the animal and human variety);  and last but certainly not least Turkish (Jason Statham) and Tommy (Stephan Graham), partners (but not the kind that `hold hands and take windy walks,' as Turkish puts it) in running an illegal bare-knuckle boxing ring.<br/><br/>What follows is so fast-paced and intertwined that it is hard to describe it.<br/><br/>In short, Tommy has to buy a new caravan-cum-office for Turkish from some low-brow gypsy types, and ends up getting ripped off.  So he puts his boxer Gorgeous George up against one of them and losesso badly in fact, that for several minutes he thinks Gorgeous is dead.  Turkish and Tommy have to inform Brick Top that they've `lost Gorgeous George' (`How the hell can you lose him ?  It's not as though he's inconspicuous, now is it ?'), which puts them in his debt, not a good place to be.  They make a deal to replace Gorgeous with the Pikey (a derogative term for the gypsy-trailer trash type that he's one of) that knocked out Gorgeous, and Brick Top insists that the Pikey throw the fight.<br/><br/>Intertwined with that, Doug `the Head' Denovitz (Mike Reid) informs cousin Avi that Frankie Four Fingers is going to be at that illegal boxing match. Avi is so furious with the idea that Frankie will wager his diamond, that he flies to London to seek him out (and trust me, Avi loathes the idea of going to London) and stop him.  At the same time, Vinnie and Sol are set to rob Brick Top's bookies and get the diamond, when things really go to pieces. There is no money for them to steal, due to the fact that a fighter was replaced at the last minute, and they end up minus a gun and locked behind the security door, in what is claimed to be a mock-up of a true life robbery attempt here in the US.<br/><br/>I'm really giving too much away here, but I loved this movie so much that I find it hard to keep it to a minimum when discussing it.  I haven't yet found a review that truly did it justice, and I'm sure I'm not doing much better.  But trust meeven if you're not `into British humor' you'll love Snatch."
"MadReviewer","7","1","2","4 September 2001"," A Glorious, Enthusiastic Mess of a Film
","Guy Ritchie's `Snatch' is a highly entertaining crime caper featuring innovative (and often brilliant) direction as well as a horde of memorable, over-the-top characters. The direction and the characters are so good, in fact, that it's quite easy to overlook the threadbare story buried at the bottom of the film. `Snatch' is a great example of a film that excels at flash, flair and extraneous details . . . but has some significant problems with its basic foundation. The end results are still remarkably good, but the flaws  while covered up incredibly well -- are enough to keep `Snatch' from achieving the greatness that it comes so close to grasping. (Or snatching, as the case may be.)<br/><br/>The film begins with underground fight promoter Turkish (Jason Statham), a decent guy running with a bad crowd, agreeing to put one his fighters in a fixed bout for the big-time criminal Brick Top (Alan Ford). Meanwhile, Franky Four Fingers (Del Toro), who has recently stolen an eighty-five carat diamond for his boss Cousin Avi (Farina), has decided to place some bets on Brick Top's fixed fight.  Nothing goes even remotely right for anyone, of course, and soon there's a mad search on for the diamond by a number of low-life hoodlums, as well as some problems arising from Turkish's new bare-knuckle brawler, a Gypsy named Mickey (Brad Pitt). .  .<br/><br/>
`Snatch' is a film that's pure eye candy, which is why it's such a joy to watch. Give Guy Ritchie massive amounts of credit -- the man's quite a director. He's a master at editing scenes together in innovative ways, and putting together otherwise ordinary scenes with ingenious and creative methods. `Snatch' is a veritable how-to handbook on visual directing techniques, and it's almost a downright guilty pleasure watching Mr. Ritchie construct this film into such a vibrant, dazzling-looking finished product. The same must be said for the characters, who seem to have come from a place somewhere between `Dick Tracy' and `Reservoir Dogs' -- each and every character in `Snatch' is a distinct and memorable creation, worthy of starring in their own movie, every if they're only on screen for a few moments. (Cousin Avi, Doug the Head, Frankie Four Fingers, Boris the Blade .. . good gravy, where does Guy Ritchie get these wonderful names?) All the characters in `Snatch'  and the terrific actors playing them -- are simply awesome. If any deserve special mention, though, it's Jason Statham as the beleaguered fight manager Turkish and Vinnie Jones as the villainous Bullet Tooth Tony. (Any mainstream action film producer would be wise to cast Vinnie Jones as the main villain in any upcoming summer blockbuster; it's almost scary how well Mr. Jones can play a cold-blooded killer.) The characters are an utter joy to watch, and they're filmed in such a highly original and entertaining manner that `Snatch' actually stands apart from other standard action films and independent Tarantino wannabes as something worth watching.<br/><br/>The real problem with `Snatch', though, is that for all its wonderful scenes and awesome characters . . . there's simply not enough story to go around. There's two basic storylines for the film, both pretty good -- but even combined, these storylines are barely enough to last an hour. On the commentary track for the DVD of `Snatch', Guy Ritchie states that his goal for the film was to make a lean and mean story -- well, he succeeded at that goal, but the lean, mean story gets completely bogged down from the weight of its overwhelming horde of characters. Despite how good they are, `Snatch' either would've benefited from a reduction of its cast, if only to provide more time to focus on the storylines; or the addition of a third storyline giving some of the characters more to do also could've helped. (It also might've helped if there was more correlation between the two storylines; the relationship between the two is cursory at best. What's going on in one storyline usually has only slight, minor repercussions affecting the other, and most of the time `Snatch' feels like two distinct and separate small films.)<br/><br/>`Snatch' is a terrific joy ride of a film. The only problem is that the ride really doesn't go anywhere. Still, `Snatch' is one of the best-looking films of the year, and even if it's not necessarily the most satisfying of films, it's certainly a heck of a lot of fun. Worth checking out, for sure. Grade: B+"

","Guy Ritchie is a tremendous visual director, but someone needs to teach him how to tell a story.  Snatch is a shallow, undisciplined, poorly structured piece of work.  Undeniably, its very entertaining but a little more substance is needed in order to make great cinema and Snatch does not provide it.<br/><br/>The film is so unstructured that even the trailer and the video description fail to accurately synopsise this music video of a film.  If you are a product of the MTV generation and have little more than a three-second attention span then you'll probably like it, but I couldn't possibly sit through it again because there cannot be anything more for me to see.<br/><br/>Like Lock, Stock this film is a classic triumph of style over substance and like Lock, Stock it left me feeling like I'd seen the work of an adolescent schoolboy.  Snatch was ultimately frustrating in that - not unlike Pulp Fiction - it presented a number of great ideas that in themselves would have made good films but failed to adequately explore any one idea to a fulfilling conclusion. <br/><br/>On the positive side, I liked Jason Statham's performance and I particularly like his real life girlfriend.  Brad Pitt was a revelation as the totally incoherent ""One punch"" Mickey and the comedic aspects of the film worked very well.  The plotting, however, though initially fairly tight developed into little more than a series of sketches based upon the loose theme of the stolen diamonds.  Hence, my feeling that I was watching an immature piece of work.  A less visual and more plot driven director could have made Snatch into a funny yet gritty drama on the pursuit of the diamonds by the various criminal elements. Instead we're given a hotchpotch of, funny, but loose ideas and very, very violent sketches giving an overall impression that's massively different from the impression we're given from the trailer.  I found it very disappointing.<br/><br/>I have to apologise to all the people who have written positive comments on this film and also to instruct the bloke who's seen it sixteen times to get a life, but the movie Snatch has much less to it than meets the eye."

"Anonymous_Maxine","10","1","2","16 February 2001"," Better than Pulp Fiction?
","Okay, Snatch may not be better than Pulp Fiction, that's like saying `bigger than Jesus.' But Snatch was a pretty big surprise that kind of came out of nowhere. Besides the first rate performances, this film had some incredibly innovative photography (second only to The Matrix?), as well as some brilliant editing techniques. Some of the editing was so fast and so surprising that it's actually funny (the plane-flight sequences, for example).<br/><br/>I normally don't like it when well known actors take on roles involving false accents, and I was actually slightly disappointed when I realized that Brad Pitt's would be this type of role. But as the movie progressed, the fake accent oddly became less and less noticeable, and by the end it had actually become one of the better parts of Pitt's performance in this film. The character that he played (`One Punch' Mickey) possessed some distinct similarities to Tyler, the character that he played in Fight Club, but was a bit more redneck and less into associating with the outside world. This was a great character, too, especially coming right from Fight Club. That first fight scene was awesome, and as soon as he throws that first punch, you just want to see more. Maybe the fight scenes were a little exaggerated occasionally, but they were just so much fun to watch.<br/><br/>
(spoilers) Unfortunately, I have to admit that I was and am still deeply disappointed by the quick departure of Franky Four Fingers, because Benecio Del Toro stood a good chance of being one of the best actors in the film (he definitely achieved that status in The Way of the Gun). Luckily, the rest of this film was so good that it overshadowed this bad choice of characterization. The presentation of the film (of several different story lines all finally converging at the end) is not exactly original, but at least it is utilized very effectively here. Besides that, the movie is full of the obligatory one-liners, but strangely enough, they were able to come up with one after another of these and they were all good, none of that crap that you see coming from Arnie or Van Damme or Seagal.<br/><br/>Snatch is a British action comedy in the tradition of Trainspotting (sort of) and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, and it is a very well thought out and put together movie. It has countless respectable characteristics, such as the different but very good performances, the excellent directing and editing, as well as a charming title (!!). Don't be put off by the fact that the charming title makes it sound like a low budget porno, this is just an excellent action/crime film."

"urbanstruggle","Null","1","2","27 January 2001"," The most pretentious film I've seen in a long time
","I really did like Guy Ritchie's debut ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", but ""Snatch"" is really over the top. It has some funny moments, but all in all, this is not a good movie.<br/><br/>First off, as many critics and viewers alike have citied, this is pretty much the same movie as ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". I'm sure people who liked this film will argue that I'm wrong and that's just a generalization, but the two films are so alike, its not even funny.<br/><br/>Secondly, Ritchie has taken his ""hip"" style to the utter extreme, here. I enjoyed the way Ritchie subtly used his quirky camera effects and quick shots in 'Lock Stock', but the key word here is ""subtly"". In ""Snatch"", he goes for the overkill and the whole movie ends up feeling like a 90 minute music video. It was so bad that I honestly felt like walking out of the theater only 10 minutes into this film. The whole film felt like a giant forced exercise in pseudo-coolness for the MTV generation. Christ, I was surprised not to see Kurt Loader or Carson Daily standing anywhere in the film, holding a microphone with screaming fans in the background. As you can expect from this description, it is filled with so many shots that just scream ""Hey, look at me. I'm Guy Ritchie. Look how cool this shot is. I'm so cool"". Reminded a lot of that modernized ""Romeo and Juliet"" movie that came out 4 or 5 years ago (with DiCaprio and Claire Danes). It's dumbed down, wannabe slick, cool and hip entertainment for people who like to think they are above, say ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" or ""Scary Movie"", but are certainly well below the works of David Mamet or The Coen Brothers.<br/><br/>Thirdly, this film seems very stereotypical to British culture. I would be very surprised a British born director would give his characters such fake brit/cockney tripe dialogue if I wasn't already aware that this film was so obviously made with an American audience in mind. I would also have a very hard time believing Guy Ritchie was really British at all and wasn't just an American posing as a Brit if it weren't for the fact that his American characters in this film were just as fake and badly stereotyped. Brad Pitt wasn't half as bad as I thought he would be, but he certainly wasn't funny, unless you happened to be a North American male in Junior High that still thinks that a stereotyped British accent alone is funny enough. And Benecio Del Toro's fake (insert nationality here of which I honestly can't remember in the slightest) accent was even worse, in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>That's not to say this was a really bad film. I did laugh several times and enjoyed the scene's with that big, tall, brute hit-man guy that was also in 'Lock Stock', but all in all, this was a very pretentious and useless re-hash of ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and I'm not impressed with the masturbatory filmmaking direction Ritchie has taken. I'm aware that Ritchie was a TV Ad director before deciding he was a filmmaking protege, but that doesn't give him an excuse for making a film like a TV Ad (let's just hope that Spike Jonze doesn't make the same mistake).  Nothing worse than a show-off filmmaker, just ask Brian DePalma's and Oliver Stone's critics. I give it a 5/10."

When I saw that it is still in the top 100 at imdb, nearly 20 years after its release, I decided to give it another try.<br/><br/>Snatch is entertaining enough, I suppose, as it does build suspense and offers several twists and turns. It came out about the time of Fight Club, so my best guess is that there is a large contingent of fight-loving fellows rating films at this site. Lots of blood and gore and dark comedy which oscillates between slapstick and sociopathy.<br/><br/>The voice-over style used was of course made popular by Goodfellas (Scorsese) and by now has certainly been seen many times since. The tone of the crime caper, too, is found in movies such as the Ocean series (albeit with much less murder). So maybe Snatch is considered a genre-bending antecedent, sort of a cross between the Coen brothers and Tarantino? Not sure. Not really my kind of thing.<br/><br/>I remain mystified by the longevity of the high rating. I mean is this film really supposed to be better than Taxi Driver, Lawrence of Arabia, Double Indemnity, I Ladri di Biciclette...? What may have happened is that most of the 700K+ reviewers of Snatch posted ratings in the brief period after the film´s release in a state of post-viewing euphoria induced by violence-induced adrenalin rushes. Perhaps they were also still riding the testosterone wave of Fight Club."

","Turkish (Jason Statham), Tommy (Stephen Graham), Brick Top (Alan Ford), Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones), Boris The Blade (Rade Serbedzija), Sol (Lennie James), Vinny (Robbie Gee), Tyrone (Ade), Gorgeous George (Adam Fogerty), Frankie Four Fingers (Benicio del Toro), Cousin Avi Denovitz and the list goes on. If that gaggle of unique character names and cast members does not spark your movie watching interest I don't know what will. These characters are just part of the many great elements that make up the movie ""Snatch""; which landed the 100th spot on the ""IMDb top 250"" movies list.<br/><br/>With a plot focused theme, this comedy/thriller takes us on an outing full of hilarious mischief, and it plays off the popular saying ""trust no one"". Fast paced and full of plot twist, we watch the main character Turkish become involuntarily involved in troublesome predicaments. Turkish and Tommy have their hands full trying to pay off a debt owed to the gangster Brick Top due to a boxing bet gone bad, because Mickey (their unruly prize fighter) not being able to follow directions. At the same time, we have the feud between Boris and Cousin Avi Denovtiz over a diamond heist performed by Frankie Four Fingers whom worked for Avi and was set up to be robbed by Boris. Boris the Blade's reputation for violence requires Avi to hire the hit-man Bullet Tooth Tony to help him retrieve his stolen diamond. Although Avi hired an able body to complete his task, Boris was not so fortunate when he hired the incapable Sol, Vinny and Tyrone to steal the stone from Frankie Four Fingers, and rob the bookies owned by the gangster Brick Top. Brick Top in turn puts on a search to find the 3 who attempted to rob his establishment, and they in turn give Brick Top knowledge of the diamond which he sends them to retrieve to avoid death. Whew! That's a lot going on. So, after many bullets fly, and hysterical interactions take place the movie comes full circle, and we end with the main character/narrator Turkish on top with the diamond, alongside his friend Tommy. <br/><br/>""Snatch"" is riddled with jump-cuts, witty fast paced dialogue, and subjective camera angles that help the audience stay interested, and feel like part of the film. Every scene plays into the plot, and any unneeded story/scenes are left out of the film. So, it is important for viewers to be attentive while watching the film or you will be sure to miss amusing conversations, and key moments. The angles help you engage in the conversation as they seem to be in first person view and the cut back and forth between the characters. Guy Richie used the same style and plot driven theme in his other film ""Locked, Stocked, and Two Smoking Barrels"". We also see some of the same actors such as Jason Statham and Vinnie Jones in this film too, but it was missing Brad Pitt who puts on a noteworthy performance as Mickey in ""Snatch"". <br/><br/>Though quite comical Snatch is most certainly an adult film. Although some parts of the movie can be considered grisly, it still manages to put a funny spin on murder, and deception (I know that sounds a little crazy). Between a botched robbery, which included a getaway driver who can barely fit in his own car, Brick Top's passion for pigs, and Bullet Tooth Tony's different but effective way of handling his victims, you will get a fair share of laughing at illegal activities.<br/><br/>If you are a person who loves movies that are plot driven, fast paced, and packed with charismatic dialogue be sure to watch ""Snatch"" when you get a chance. This movie will not disappoint."
"EthanBJones_03","10","1","3","2 August 2017"," The most delightfully insane thing I have ever laid my eyes on!
","'SNATCH' was directed by Guy Ritchie and stars Jason Statham, Brad Pitt and Alan Ford. ​Illegal boxing promoter Turkish (Jason Statham) convinces gangster Brick Top (Alan Ford) to offer bets on bare- knuckle boxer Mickey (Brad Pitt) at his bookie business. When Mickey does not throw his first fight as agreed, an infuriated Brick Top demands another match. Meanwhile, gangster Frankie Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) comes to place a bet for a friend with Brick Top's bookies, as multiple criminals converge on a stolen diamond that Frankie has come to London to sell.<br/><br/>This is the most insane, weird, amazing movie I have ever seen in my entire existence. The story is insane, the characters are insane, the acting(I'm looking at you Pitt!) is insane - it is the actual definition of what in God's name is going on.... and I love it. <br/><br/>The plot is delightfully insane. It really is. It is a slow buildup of several loosely related plots that combine into one mad, insane overarching story to create an equally insane outcome. Something I did not expect from this movie was non-linear storytelling. This is often a risk in film but I 100% think it worked here. <br/><br/>There are a LOT of characters in this film and I can't even hope to mention them all. A good place to start, however, will be with our lead man. Jason Statham portrays Turkish, our lead man if you couldn't guess, and does a fantastic job at it. Turkish is a really good protagonist and his street nature gives him the fun edge over other characters.<br/><br/>I could spend days picking apart Brad Pitt's fantastic portrayal of Mickey but I wont for the sake of time. In short, Pitt gives a truly memorable performance and brings a character, which really shouldn't work on paper, to life and makes him the funniest and most entertaining character in the movie.<br/><br/>Alan Ford is great as Brick Top. Brick Top is a genuinely terrifying, yet also strangely humorous, villain that will gives you chills and laughs at the same time. A genuinely great performance.<br/><br/>Rade ​Serbedzij was great as Boris the Blade, a very mysterious, intriguing character who was handled exceptionally well and was very entertaining. I will now say a sentence I NEVER expected to have to say: I liked Vinnie Jones in this movie. I really did. Bullet Tooth Tony was an intimidating muscle and served his role to the movie very well. Robbie Gee and Lennie James were both good as Vinny & Sol respectively. Dennis Farina was good as Cousin Avi. Benicio Del Toro was great as Franky Four Fingers. I obviously left some people out but there are so many characters in this movie and they are all so amazing, I couldn't possibly mention them all.<br/><br/>This movie is more Guy Ritchie than if Guy Ritchie had a child with himself and that child was forced to sit through ONLY Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels for their entire life before having a child with themselves. I love Ritchie's style and cannot fault it. Many, many people will hate this movie purely because of Ritchie's style but I still adore it.<br/><br/>The costume and set design is amazing.<br/><br/>I love this movie. I regret not seeing it sooner. It is an awesome, hilarious, fantastic crime-comedy-thriller? I can 100% recommend you check it out if you can handle Ritchie levels higher than the distance to the moon and back, if you are standing on Pluto. I'll rate this movie 10 ​'lwjdadlsnld...Caravan.....adasdakwpwejh... me ma.....sddads's out of 10. Please see this awesome movie! It is awesome!"

","Reading the background of this movie I didn't expect it to be as good as it was.. I was so wrong. I absolutely loved this movie! The storyline and plot were so well written and executed throughout the movie I couldn't have been more entertained. There was a movie made after Snatch called Red it was made in 2010 and the films to me are similar; not just because Bruce Willis stars in it but because the balance of comedic elements with Crime elements were similar. They both made you laugh at the same time they were doing something illegal, which in turn sort of made you look past certain scenes and focus mainly on the fact that you were laughing at something and ignoring that they were doing things that would break laws. It also seems similar to me because in the movie Red there was a man that walked around with a stuffed animal because it was filled with something and in Snatch they have the dog that swallowed diamond which in both films added to the comedy. Overall I loved this movie and I 100% recommend it to anyone."

It's his second movie after 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. He has a crazy unique style. The story is hard to follow, but it's not actually the most important part of the movie. It's Guy Ritchie's unreserved style and excessive energy that is on display here. It's a constant stream of outrageous characters, over the top mannerisms, and great actors having loads of fun. Brad Pitt is completely wacko. There is just so much going on in this one."

","This is probably the fifth time I have seen this film (though I may have watched it more than that, but I cannot say for sure) and I still quite like it, particularly since there are still a number of scenes that cause me to burst out laughing. It also has the classic line 'anything to declare?' 'Yes, don't go to England!' Now, don't get me wrong, I love England, however that one line has stuck in my head that when I arrived in Hong Kong after spending two nights in Bangkok, if anybody at Hong Kong customs were to ask me if I had anything to declare (mind you, you don't actually go through customs in Hong Kong, only if you have something to declare) I was going to say 'yeah, don't go to Thailand' (though I must heed the warning of a friend of mine from my last job not to crack jokes at customs).<br/><br/>This movie is about power, or about perceived power. Throughout the movie it appears that the one man who holds all the cards is a gangster named Bricktop, however this is only an illusion in his mind. He has power because people fear him, and as long as people fear him, he has power. However the problem that he faces is that he cannot always make people fear him, and while he believes that everybody fears him, it is that belief that ends up bringing his downfall.<br/><br/>There is actually a lot of threads that movie through this movie, which all converge at the end, and Guy Richie did this very well in this movie and in Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Unfortunately in Sherlock Holmes he falls into the more traditional Hollywood style, and the other two movies that he made between this one, and Sherlock Holmes were pretty ordinary (one I did not watch, and another I simply cannot remember). He made a huge success with Lock Stock, however the originality that he brought about in his first movie seems to begin to flag in this film.<br/><br/>Yes, it is still incredibly funny in parts, and Vinnie Jones' character can be an absolute scream at times (as well as the scene with the replicas and his friend the Desert Eagle .05), however at other parts the film simply seems to be full of clichés. What is also good is that Brad Pitt comes into this film to demonstrate his ability to simply create a character that is memorable. Richie's first movie was full of unknowns (with the exception of Vinnie Jones, but then unless you followed the English Premiership League, you would unlikely know him) but that movie, and this film, pretty much made Jason Stratham. However Richie was never able to really capitalise on his success, until Sherlock Holmes that is, and while that film still had a lot of his style in it, it seemed to simply slip into what one would expect from a big budget Hollywood blockbuster."

","A ""pikey"", or piker as it sounds coming from the mouth of Jason Statham's character Turkish, is a slang term for an Irish Gypsy.

Pitt's character is a bare-knuckle boxer with a reputation for one-hit knockouts. Between drug-dealers, thieves, fighters, and boxing promoters and even hit men, there are countless entertaining characters to watch play out the true theme of the movie which is the fight for a priceless diamond, it ends very well and is definitely worth the watch.

"Desertman84","10","1","3","30 December 2011"," Snatch: Excellent Movie
","Guy Ritchie's sophomore follow-up to his 1998 sleeper hit Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch revisits the previous film's territory of London's crime-ridden underbelly, and does so with the same brand of humor and stylish direction that made his first effort a surprise success.A crime film written and directed by British filmmaker,Snatch features an ensemble cast namely: Jason Statham,Stephen Graham,Alan Ford,Dennis Farina,Brad Pitt,Vinnie Jones,Robbie Gee,Lennie James,Ade,Rade erbedija and Benicio del Toro.Set in the London criminal underworld, it contains two intertwined plots: one dealing with the search for a stolen diamond, the other with a small-time boxing promoter named Turkish who finds himself under the thumb of a ruthless gangster known as Brick Top.Also,it it features an assortment of colourful characters, including gypsy Mickey O'Neil, arms-dealer Boris ""the Blade"" Yurinov, professional thief and gambling addict Frankie ""Four-Fingers"", American gangster-jeweler ""Cousin Avi"", and bounty hunter Bullet-Tooth Tony. <br/><br/>With a labyrinthine plot that is ostensibly oriented around a missing diamond, Snatch introduces viewers to three groups of characters intent on retrieving the elusive stone, which has been stolen from an Antwerp jeweler. In the first group are friends and business partners Turkish and Tommy, who join up with Mickey, an Irish gypsy and boxer. Turkish and Tommy make arrangements with Mickey to take a fall in a match engineered by lunatic gang leader Brick Top. In another corner resides equally loony Russian gangster Boris the Blade, who has asked Jewish gangster Franky Four Fingers to place a bet on the match for him. Boris is also scheming to have Sol, the owner of a pawn shop, rob the place with a couple of dim associates. Meanwhile, Avi, freshly arrived in London from New York, hires Bullet Tooth Tony to find Franky when he goes missing; it seems that it was none other than Franky who was supposed to be transporting the purloined diamond to New York.<br/><br/>It is distinguished by a kinetic direction and editing style, a circular plot featuring numerous ironic twists of chance and causality, and a fast pace.Through this style,Rictchie makes the film totally satisfying and entertaining. Also,it holds the audience interest from beginning to end. This also make the film original which makes it not formulaic and predictable.The movie is also characterized by brilliant performances as they enhance their interesting characters through their great portrayal.As a result,Snatch is a must-see for it is one excellent movie."

"The_Movie_Cat","7","1","3","6 September 2000"," ""It's not too subtle, but effective""
","Guy Ritchie is not a satisfying writer-director and nor do I ever think he will be. The cocksure, pop video excesses and smart-arsed, stilted, would-be clever dialogue is the same as ever in Snatch, a mite better than ""Lock, Stock..."" but still a clear ""5"".<br/><br/>Snatch, the smug, self-satisfied title, is, as well as a word for stealing; also a slang term for the female member, a point that I doubt was lost on the producers. Rather appropriately then, this is a male-dominated film, with women having no role (apart from the wooden-as-a-crate twin daughters of ""Tony the Head"") except to bare their breasts. This laddish, sixth-form sexism goes hand-in-hand with the usual sub-racism and homophobia that punctuates a Ritchie endeavour.<br/><br/>In many ways this is worse than the comparatively laid-back Barrels, as its clumsy post-modernism is even more apparent: a quote from Pulp Fiction is used, the Michael Caine homage is more heart-felt, and Reservoir Dogs is referenced even before the close of the beginning titles.<br/><br/>The contrived plot and action-led pace are, however, thrown together with such veracity that, like Lock, Stock..., it is readily watchable, if not actually any good. For a first time viewing, at any rate. What crushes it is Ritchie's need to make every line a ""funny"" line, which takes away all sense of reality. Look at the scene where a betting shop assistant is held at gunpoint, refusing to hand over money, and being told: ""I ain't f****** buying that!"" ""Well,"" she replies, a tad unrealistically as she's under threat of death, ""that's fine, cos I ain't f****** selling it."" You suspect that if Ritchie had the guts to make a serious, sincere UK gangster movie then it would be more bearable, rather than one which gorges on the rotting carcasses of superior stablemates.<br/><br/>Where the film crucially falls down is in it's casting. How so many bad actors could be in one movie is staggering. What is worse, the few that do give a decent performance are given minimal roles, or roles that make the least of their talents, with a ""was he actually in the film?"" appearance from Trainspotting's Ewan Bremner. Alan Ford is okay as Brick Top, though others – most notably Ade in his movie debut – are awful, though doubtlessly hindered by the weak script. Mike Read appears as Tony the Head (which sounds less like a gangster, more the male equivalent of Linda Lovelace), though is wasted by being reduced to a cursory cameo role. He doesn't even get to say ""wot are yer, some kind o' pilchard?""<br/><br/>The other two decent performances come from Brad Pitt, and, surprisingly, Vinnie Jones. After humiliating himself with a lame turn in Gone In Sixty Seconds, he does better here than most of the ""professionals"" with him; even though when he uses big words, you doubt if he knows what they really mean. Brad is, of course, the main appeal, almost unrecognisable as a tattooed, nonsense-Irish speaking bare-knuckle fist fighter. When he's on the screen, it almost lights up, only to darken again when he leaves it. Not a wholly successful addition, the standard of his acting and obvious presence make you think he's in a different film to most of the third-rates walking around pretending to be Bob Hoskins. Yet it is clear Brad loved his role in a low-budget Brit movie, and even appears to ad-lib his obscenity to an over-zealous dog. (Also look out for the hastily cut scene where Vinnie starts to crack up as another dog gets carried away and attacks an actor he wasn't supposed to). There are precisely three laughs in the movie, all of which are unintentional. The first two I've just detailed, the last sees dance artist Goldie indulging in some attempted thesping. ""Stick to being a gangster, Lee, leave this game to me and Sol,"" he is told by Robbie Gee.<br/><br/>One last moan? The self-consciously cool music score (soundtrack already available in stores), which, idiotically, has no relevance or association with what's on screen; be it The Stranglers' ""Golden Brown"" being set, for no reason other than it's a good song, to a bout, or ""Ghost Town"", The Specials' satire of my home town, being commercialised and stripped down to gain brownie points from muso-nostalgists.<br/><br/>This is a film that will be lauded by Loaded readers, a lazy retread of a weak first film that largely wastes its resources. The picture concludes with Huey ""Piano"" Smith singing ""ha, ha, ha, ha"" through the end credits. Good luck to you, Huey – you're the only one laughing.<br/><br/>POST SCRIPT - September 2015. I can only conclude that I was in an incredibly bad mood when I wrote this somewhat churlish review 15 years ago. Yes, Snatch isn't especially deep, but it's very entertaining, something only highlighted further by the existence of the YouTube spoof ""Snatch Wars"" in the interim. There's a lot I didn't mention in the review above, such as the inspired metaphorical underwater sequence, and the performances, in hindsight, seem a tenfold better than I gave them credit for. 7/10."

","There is no doubt that Farina's 'coolness' is an attractive quality but it is his ability to communicate passion and depth of character in combination with humor that makes him worth watching.  As with so many roles that he has played, his contribution to this movie was limited by a dimensionless character.  When will he be allowed to bring his special brand of warmth and toughness to the screen?  He did that week after week in 'Crime Story' so that leads me to believe it's the writing and directing.

He writes funny and irreverent dialogue and has a very in-you-face directing style that fits right in with the tone of the movie. The pace of the movie is constantly in overdrive, meaning that the viewer is always engaged.<br/><br/>If you take the wit and color of Ocean's 11 and combine it with the excessive violence and fractured story of Pulp Fiction, you end up with Snatch.

","Snatch is a movie from the year 2000 directed and written by Guy Richie. The movie is about Irish gangsters, hit men,jewel thieves, and a gypsy boxer. Some of the stars in the film are Jason Statham as Turkish, Brad Pitt as Mickey, Alan Ford as Brick Top, and Benicio Del Toro as Franky Four Fingers. Turkish and his sidekick Tommy get themselves into many altercations with their gangster boss Brick Top. One of the most interesting altercations is when they get involved with a bare knuckle boxer by the name of Mickey. The movie follows their attempts to survive as earned boys. <br/><br/>The theme of this movie is survival in the underground world. Turkish and Tommy make many mistakes in this movie which pushes them further and further into the underground life. I really enjoy how the director lightens the mood of these mistakes with humor. Turkish and Tommy have exceptional chemistry when it comes to disagreeing or making fun of each other. This chemistry is what kept me so involved in the movie. While there is plenty of comedy the two also display plenty of serious when death is involved. <br/><br/>The music in the film adds depth and increases the overall entertainment value. There are plenty of scenes that would have been good without the music, but when then music is added the scene becomes breath taking. In the beginning of the movie where Mickey challenges Gorgeous George to a bare knuckle fight is a good example of this. Without the music the scene would have been just like any other bare knuckle fight scene. With the addition of music and slow motion the scene comes to life.<br/><br/>Another great aspect of this movie is how it had multiple plots but still maintained to satisfy your interests with each of them. You would think that one or two plots would be hard enough to properly portray. Snatch properly portrays at least 5. Following the diamond, an unlicensed boxing promoters, a bare knuckle boxer, an Irish gangster, and a confused timid sidekick is not a easy task. Guy Ritchie does an exceptional job of explaining each in great detail in 104 minutes.<br/><br/>Snatch is one of my favorite movies of all times. I really enjoy knowing that I only knew one actor in this movie. I did not know the director or the writer or any other actors for this matter. This movie has an completely unbiased review from me. Yet it remains to be in my top 5 all time list of greatest movies."
"misha1998","10","1","4","26 April 2014"," Ritchie delivers a brilliant and often hysterically funny film
","Guy Ritchie has made himself a cult director. With the exception of Swept Away and Revolver, his films have been noted for their usage of irony and for their extremely colorful characters.<br/><br/>The film begins with one of the most expertly made heist scenes. No shots were even fired while the four Jews were busting the diamond bank. After the heist, they get a huge 84 carat diamond (which is flawless, according to Vincent in a later scene).<br/><br/>We then cut to Turkish, who was named after a plane crash. Why? His parents met on that plane. He is a boxing promoter and his manager, Brick Top is a extremely scary character? Why? Because if something goes very wrong with him and it is related to a person that he knows he goes to murder that person, and then feed him to the pigs.<br/><br/>Things go from bad to worse when Boris the Blade hires three complete idiots to rob a bookies. They later realize that someone has entered the bookies and they think it is Franky, but its really just a complete stranger. Franky then is murdered and things not only spiral out of control, but into one of the most hilarious films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about this film, but I shall leave it here. This film is a masterwork by Guy Ritchie and is one of my all time favorite movies of all time. The way he treats this film is absolute beauty."
"Mihaela_Lacramioara","10","1","4","24 April 2012"," Instant Classic
","This is one of those movies you watch and know it will be always revered as a classic.<br/><br/>Jason Statham (Turkish) did an excellent job in this movie. He plays the character perfectly.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt was also amazing. However, it almost seemed like they deliberately made his voice sound incoherent to make the accent more convincing. But otherwise he did fantastic.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were fun, the action was amazing, and the various shootouts kept me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>Everyone did fantastic and I will definitely be watching this again."
"Leofwine_draca","10","1","5","23 December 2016"," The pinnacle of Guy Ritchie's career
","This sleek, stylish and very effective black comedy-cum crime thriller is an excellent movie, and one of those rare 'perfect' films where it would be difficult to spot one flaw let alone a number. A follow-up to Guy Ritchie's powerhouse debut, LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS, this sees the director in familiar territory with a haphazard plot involving a stolen diamond and an Irish gypsy boxer. It doesn't make much sense, there's no story, but what you do get are hundreds of twists and turns and confrontations, some absolutely hilarious scenes of comedy (anything with the dog in it is a classic) and tons of class acting and class actors.<br/><br/>Jason Statham is great as the cool underdog; Alan Ford will scare the heck out of you as the supremely nasty Brick Top. Brad Pitt is welcome as the unintelligible Irish bare-knuckle boxer and his performance is spot-on, whilst Vinnie Jones makes a welcome return as gold-toothed bad guy Bullet Tooth Tony. Expect a host of cameos and walk-ons (Dennis Farina is particularly good, Benicio del Toro is particularly weird and spineless, Abe as Tyrone is hilarious), including small roles for our very own Goldie, Ewen Bremner, and Mike Reid, and you have a wonderfully wicked little film. SNATCH is packed with cool and punchy dialogue, originality, and a welcome freshness to the story, tons and tons of style, lots of violence and hilarious situations and much, much more. A real winner of a film."
"MartinHafer","9","1","5","12 August 2013"," Good, but it's not a film for most folks....
","My summary sounds a bit vague, so let me explain. ""Snatch."" is a very, very, very bloody and violent film. It also has a lot of very rough language and a bit of nudity. So, it's obviously not a film you show your kids, your mother-in-law or Father Jenkins!! This isn't as much a complaint as an observation--one you really should heed before you try watching the film. I just can't see most folks gravitating to a movie like this one, though if you do, it IS incredibly unique and well made.<br/><br/>This film begins with a jewel robbery in which a nearly baseball-sized diamond is stolen. While this might seem like a great thing for the thieves, it sets of a LONG series of violent events as practically every gang in the UK seems willing to kill to get it. Most of these gangs are insanely dangerous, while some are comically stupid and a few are really hard to size up. Repeatedly, folks are killed and repeatedly the diamond changes hands. Who, ultimately, will get the diamond and who will survive? You'll have no idea up until the final crazy ending.<br/><br/>""Snatch."" is an incredibly stylish film--quite artistic in the way it is pieced together. It is even more stylish than Tarantino's ""Kill: Bill"" movies. And, the plot is amusing (while it isn't nauseating or scaring the life out of you). A thoroughly unpredictable and ROUGH film. If it's the sort of thing you like, you'll love it. As for me, I rate the film highly but it really isn't the sort of thing I like because of its excesses and I felt a bit uneasy laughing through the carnage (and, oddly, the film is quite funny). Worth seeing for the right crowd."

","A knock-off of the successful but obnoxious ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" undoubtedly designed to milk young and adoring Ritchie junkies of all they're worth, ""Snatch"" is another inelegant, unsophisticated, herky-jerky claptrap flick loaded cockamamie cockney comic book characters caught up in a monotonous droning buzz of a numbing nonstory.

","""Snatch"" is a well-crafted film with some good performances, and it will keep you entertained, but it has some flaws that will prevent me from ever bothering to watch it again...<br/><br/>1. The silly names of the characters are a bit much.  <br/><br/>2. The anti-gay comments of one of the thugs are not necessary and spoil the fun of the film for me.  Would they include racist comments of a comparable nature? Heck no.  It really ticks me off that filmmakers think it's still fine to dehumanize gays.<br/><br/>3. Brad Pitt isn't used enough.  He's the only character who lights up the screen in this film.  <br/><br/>It's a straight boy film, and the straight boys in the audience I saw it with all cheered at the end (for some reason), so I don't expect to have loved it.  But it could have been a far more fun ride for all of us.  It's a pity it's so limited in this respect."

"dbdumonteil","Null","1","8","17 October 2003"," In 1983, Sonic Youth said: ""confusion is sex"". Well in 2000, ""confusion is snatch""!
","""Snatch"" is a movie that I wanted to see for a long time because I heard a lot of good things about Guy Ritchie's movie. So I watched it and I must say that I was absolutely amazed. I mean that I didn't feel happiness but disappointment, a big disappointment...<br/><br/>However, at first, ""Snatch"" is a promising movie thanks to a catchy story. In short, it deals with a pursuit around a priceless diamond in which (too many) characters and a dog are involved.<br/><br/>But the main problem of ""Snatch"" resides in its screenplay. The quality of the screenplay is identical as Brad Pitt's way of speaking in this movie (he acts a gipsy who's keen on boxing). It means that the screenplay is so confused that it makes the movie hard to follow. You could even think that the plot is non-existent. Indeed, instead of following the unifying thread of the main plot, you feel that the movie is divided in several individual little plots apparently without any link. The screenplay is also muddled due to an important number of the characters.<br/><br/>Moreover, Guy Ritchie obviously wanted to make a black comedy. This is in itself a good idea but here, we deal with a black humor that isn't very well exploited. So as a consequence, you don't laugh a lot.<br/><br/>As for Ritchie's directing, well we can say that it's lively, maybe a little too lively to leave the movie an impression of botched up in spite of interesting and clever ideas. Ritchie must have been influenced by ""Fight Club"" (1999) by David Fincher because his making contains likenesses with Fincher's making in the quoted film.<br/><br/>At the end, ""Snatch"" is a disappointment and an unfunny movie. One last thing: be warned! The movies that are included in the top 250 on imdb aren't inevitably the best ones..."
"jboothmillard","5","1","12","5 December 2005"," Snatch
","From writer/director Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), when I first saw this film I gave it quite a positive review, second time, my opinion changed a little. Basically it is a bit of an ensemble story, with various characters getting involved with petty crime and gambling for big money. We see Turkish (Transporter's Jason Statham) and his accomplice Tommy (This Is England's Stephen Graham) are getting into the business of match fixing, Brick Top (Alan Ford), and their plan is marred by ""pikey"" (Irish Gypsy) Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt) knocking out the planned winner, Gorgeous George (Adam Fogerty). Mickey, originally just selling Turkish, an unlicensed fight promoter, his caravan, is being paid by them not just to do fights, but to lose them as well. Meanwhile, a huge diamond heist is being pulled off pretty unsuccessfully (in terms of accuracy) by rubbish crook brothers Vinny (Robbie Gee) and Sol (Lennie James). They are working for Abraham 'Cousin Avi' Denovitz (Dennis Farina), who is forced to come from New York to London, England but when the 84 karat stone goes missing, and it might be something to do with Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro). He gets the help of his cousin Doug 'The Head' Denovitz (EastEnders' Mike Reid) and Boris 'The Blade' Yurinov (Rade Serbedzija) to help look for it. As events twist and turn, the two stories intertwine, and the film becomes even more hard to understand, so I don't think I will bother trying to explain. Also starring Vinnie Jones as Bullet Tooth Tony, Ewen Bremner as Mullet, Jason Flemyng as Darren and Goldie as Bad Boy Lincoln. If it wasn't for the quite confusing at times story, this might have been just as entertaining as Ritchie's debut, but it just feels too seen it before style, but there are some moments that might get your attention, so it's not a complete waste of time. Worth watching!"

"KieranGriffiths","8","0","1","3 February 2020"," Snatch (2000)
","Regarded by many to be writer and director Guy Ritchie's magnum opus; Snatch serves as the follow-up to his smash-hit, cult-classic, feature-length debut Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels with more of the same. The film is an all-encompassing showreel of what makes a Guy Ritchie film, a Guy Ritchie film, with its kinetic directing and editing styles, witty and sharp dialogue, gratuitous violence, and ensemble cast of interconnected characters. You can't help but feel watching Ritchie's films, Snatch especially, that he was perhaps too inspired by the works of Quentin Tarantino, and his own attempt to recapture Pulp Fiction in a British setting falls a bit flat. As seems to be a recurring theme of Ritchie's films, the audience and critic perceptions are practically polar opposites, and I can understand why. While I think Snatch has some absolutely outstanding elements, including fantastic and memorable characters and performances, as well as being infinitely quotable and rewatchable, I do think its components are more powerful than the sum of its parts. While the film is far from perfect, it does succeed in achieving what it set out to do. A rollicking good time with plenty of thrills and laughs, that I can already see myself wanting to revisit."

"Tweekums","9","0","1","14 January 2020"," Another stylish gangster comedy from Guy Richie
","This film from 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' creator Guy Richie is centred on more gangsters, hard men and chancers. The intertwining story lines feature Turkish and Tommy, a couple of unlicensed boxing promotors who get in a spot of bother when their fighter gets beaten by 'One Punch Mickey', an Irish Gypsy, just before a fixed fight... the boys must get Mickey to fight for them if they are to avoid being fed to the pigs by mobster 'Brick Top'. Meanwhile Franky Four Fingers has stolen an eighty six carat diamond in Antwerp only to go missing in London... many people are after the diamond. Inevitably the two plots will eventually collide.<br/><br/>There may be a fair amount of violence and few of the characters are really that nice but this film is a lot of fun. There are laughs in most scenes whether it is the sight of incompetent thieves trying to rob a bookies which has no money, a dog that squeaks because it has swallowed a squeaky toy or gangsters armed with replica pistols the gags all hit the mark. The cast is large but the characters are all very distinctive so one is unlikely to get confused about who is who. I don't think there were any weak links amongst the cast which includes the likes of Jason Statham, Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro, Vinnie Jones and Dennis Farina amongst others. Not surprisingly Brad Pitt is probably the most memorable with his fine performance as Mickey; a character whose accent is deliberately almost impossible to understand at times. Overall I'd say that it doesn't matter that the film is more style than substance... that doesn't matter when it is as much fun as this. If you liked 'Lock, Stock' you will want to see this."

It was a long and half-stitched story that was concocted with unique and sticky camerawork, acting, cutwork, and music, but it was fun and fun until the end. Since there are many characters and the episodes are connected in terms of human relationships and time, it need concentration, you cannot understand unless you watch it hard. In other words, you need to watch keenly. It is the tactics of this film for involve you.

Plus the way that the storylines of all the characters interweaving is very original. The main source of the all the events of the film involves the aftermath of a stolen diamond that's worth a lot. So be prepared for a hilarious mixture of characters... 2 naive boxing promoters, a gypsy that plays by his own rules, wannabe diamond merchants, a scene stealing psycho gangster with an obsession of pigs, inexperienced armed robbers.

"jmr-72117","7","0","1","26 February 2019"," Delightfully dingy
","Snatch is a glimpse into the dark mind of Guy Ritchie, a man who has continuously created seemingly dark films, from Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels to King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. Snatch has the same feel as Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, which shows us that his love for intricate plots, wry wit, and dingy settings is never ending. With Snatch, Guy Ritchie brings angsty violence to a new level, as if Jeffrey Dahmer and David Fincher got together for coffee (or perhaps tea) in the criminal underworld of Britain.<br/><br/>The film weaves two stories together, that of a hunt for an 84-carat diamond and an unlicensed boxing match. The diamond is stolen in Antwerp by Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) to give to Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina) back in New York City. Franky is a relaxed heistman and Avi is, simply put, a precursor to the rough-around-the-edges J.K. Simmons in Spiderman. Once in possession of the diamond, Franky naively takes advice from two men, a robber who recommends Franky visit Boris the Blade (Rade Serbedzija) for weapons and Avi who sends Franky to Doug the Head (Mike Reid) for a proper appraisal. Boris, an ex-KGB agent, sends Franky to the bookies on his behalf in exchange for a gun, and proceeds to send a trio of inexperienced crooks to rob the same bookies.<br/><br/>We then find Turkish, a disgruntled Jason Statham, and his partner Tommy, an innocent Stephen Graham, sitting in a dimly lit room. Turkish is a small-time boxing promoter who soon finds himself in need of a caravan to develop his business. Turkish and Tommy travel to a group of ""pikies,"" irish travellers and speakers of a English-Irish hybrid language that you will need captioning to understand. Mickey (Brad Pitt), the leader, asks them if they like ""dags,"" sells them a hunk of junk, punches out their prized boxer, and agrees to work as their new boxer in the meantime.<br/><br/>Brick Top (Alan Ford), the gangster coordinator of the unlicensed boxing match, practically owns Turkish and Tommy, in addition to hundreds of pigs he keeps in his basement. He is the disgusting and crude puppetmaster who punishes the weak and disloyal, and who controls everyone else in the story to do his bidding. Mickey continues to fight in Brick Top's boxing matches, and the diamond moves from person to person, reaching practically every character in this tangled web of filth.<br/><br/>The film continues from there, with most characters crossing stories, and reaches complete equilibrium during one iconic scene. We see Turkish and Tommy in one car, debating the morality of Turkish drinking milk. In another car are the three inexperienced robbers, Sol (Lennie James), Vinny (Robbie Gee), and Tyrone (Ade). The third car contains Cousin Avi, his bodyguard, and ""bullet-tooth"" Tony (Vinnie Jones), who Avi hired based on his refusal of death. Oh, and Boris is in the trunk of their car. Tommy throws Turkish's milk out the window and it lands on the third car with Avi, his bodyguard, and Tony inside, who crash into a pole. Boris, with a sack over his head, jumps out of the trunk and is hit by the second car, driven by Tyrone. This is truly where Ritchie brings the story together in a way that actually makes sense.<br/><br/>Aside from this one thoughtfully planned scene, Ritchie tightens the loose-fitting plot with music by John Murphy. He distinguishes the serious moments from the comic ones through the background music. In the opening credits, we hear generic bad punk rock as bright colors and spinning images mirror the music, matching the ever gaudy 90s-style of Lola Rennt. When we meet Brick Top, an ominous and Godfather-esque track plays to show us he truly is the top dog. Ritchie makes it so, when we say ""oh shoot"" to ourselves while watching, the music determines whether it's said with a smile or with wide eyes.<br/><br/>He also uses dry humor to make chopping up a body seem like chopping vegetables, and this humor makes the religious and nationality jokes easier to swallow. The humor is in the dialogue and the cinematography. Ritchie employs quick jokes such as when Boris the Blade says,""Heavy is good. Heavy is reliable. If it doesn't work you can always hit them with it,"" referring to a gun he is selling. Ritchie also uses quick camera cuts, jumping from one character to another as he did in the triple-car scene, to make the scene that much funnier. These are staples in european comedy films and this is truly where the comedy lies, in dry and fast humor with dry and fast camera cuts. For those of us not generally accustomed to British humor, it will take at least a few viewings to understand the jokes, and even more to understand the plot.<br/><br/>Ritchie created a darkly comical film with a complicated plot, a film that is identical in formula to its predecessor, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. Where Snatch lacks in drugs and humor, it makes up for in quick cuts, one-liners and violence. Snatch takes the notorious parts of Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, and Oceans Eleven, puts them in a box, and ties it with a pigskin bow.<br/><br/>""Anything to declare?""
""Yeah. Don't go to England."""

","I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie; every single scene I found very riveting, every single character I was very interested in, and every joke, and one-liner hits the mark. But I kept wondering all the way through the movie if I really understand what's going on, and that's exactly the single issue I've with Snatch.<br/><br/>It has an unbelievably convoluted plot, and redundant characters. There are a lot of characters, which I really cared about each one of them, and every character, or rather every bunch of characters has their own sub-plot that's, for better or worse, miraculously intertwined with the very main plot.<br/><br/>It's quite puzzling that what I consider as a flaw is somehow resulted in, or caused by, a merit that was a main reason for keeping me captivated, hence a main reason for making me extremely love this movie. And the result is while it's impossible for me to ignore how confusing, and perplexing I found this movie, there are plenty of things that more than enough to make up for that.<br/><br/>First things first, this movie is immensely enjoyable! there is no scene or moment that I felt the movie dragged even a little bit, and that's due Ritchie's brilliant direction, and twisting script. The very British humor here is at its finest. It's all thanks to the perfect comic timing that is at its very best, the quick-cut and comedic editing, and the genius use of the already killer soundtrack.
You also can see very obviously how Edgar Wright took, and developed this style, and made it his own.<br/><br/>The characters, aside from portrayed by a stellar cast, especially Brad Pitt who stole the show as the Gypsy, Mickey O'Neil who you can barely understand a single word he says, they play a major part of the humor. Guy Ritchie found a fine line for his characters between being sympathetic and blameworthy. Once you will find yourself root for a character, and at another time you will wish this character gets harm very badly for the sake of some laughs, because Ritchie made you know very well that when things go wrong for the characters it's never so serious, and you would get some laughs from what you would never expect.<br/><br/>The brisk dialogue serves the humor as well, but it also flesh out the characters. Many people think Guy Ritchie tried so hard to be like Tarantino, but I totally disagree with that opinion. Yes he used the dialogue that seems to add nothing to the story, and the non-linear storytelling, but he used them in his own way, and with his very exceptional style. The non-linear storytelling felt unnecessary, though.<br/><br/>The last reason why I can partially forgive the excessive number of characters and sub-plots is that when I reached the very end of the movie, I found that I was actually got the story easily, and understood almost everything. That being said, this, in itself, emphasizes that this movie is a bit hollow, and it displays many details that don't necessarily add to the main plot. Which I found crazy, just like the movie itself!<br/><br/>(8/10)"

","Like I said in the intro, just put on this movie and sit back and relax and allow yourself to be entertained. Guy Richie does a masterful job of assembling an all star cast and giving them all an opportunity to shine. From Brad Pitt to Jason Strathom everyone seems to actually enjoy being involved in this movie and as a result, they have put on a stellar performance. The action is nonstop and the storyline moves along at a great pace as all the parties involved speed towards each of their ultimate resolutions."

","Seen it multiple times now and I really think that ""Snatch"" tries too hard to be funny and cool. It is the british wannabe brother of Tarantino. It does make for an enjoyable watch though, but the style over content attitude becomes tideous at some point. Still it is funny at times. A lot of action, you wont get bored. And there is some good acting by Brad Pitt amongst others. <br/><br/>A diamant gets stolen. And stolen again. And again. That's the story. Next to that there is another ""storyline"" in which Brad Pitt needs to go down in a boxingmatch in the 4th round to please some gangsta boss. But he wont go down. And he wont go down again. A lot of chases, threats and shootouts is what follows.<br/><br/>The speed of ""Snatch"" is suited for kids wiht ADHD. The cussing is suited for whoever likes it. It looks like a trailer for a movie instead of being a movie itself because the speed of this thing is so fast that it becomes boring at times. As I said I have watched it multiple times already, so there is definitely something that is enticing, but there is something lacking also. Good B movie, for those who prefer style over content. And there is definitely a market for that. Me being one of those people, because sometimes I just like to see a mindnumbing action movie.

","Imagine a gangster movie directed, or at the very least presented, by Quentin Tarantino. Except that it takes place in London and has a healthy heap of Monty Python thrown in the mix. That's basically Snatch in a nutshell. Directed by Guy Ritchie, who's probably most well-known as the director of those Sherlock Homes films starring Robert Downey Jr.<br/><br/>But let me tell you, this here is much more his speed, clearly. Snatch is a fast-paced, ever moving pair of intertwining tales. One of them concerning a humongous diamond being smuggled through London and the other about an upcoming underground boxing match. The character cast is sizable to say the least, but each character is such a unique snowflake (in both good and bad) that there's absolutely no fear of getting them mixed up or forgetting about them.<br/><br/>The directing and the camerawork have that Ritchie flair to them. You know those fight sequences in Sherlock where Downey Jr. would first visualize what he wanted to do and then went on and did it with the camera flying around looking for the oddest angle possible. Snatch is a lot like that, but toned down just enough that it's more stylistic than annoying. I at least enjoyed it a lot.<br/><br/>As for the movie as a whole. It's gory, it's dark, it's goofy, it doesn't take its characters all that seriously, despite some of them quite literally feeding people to pigs, and... it's simply so much fun. A horror roller coaster ride in the best possible meaning of the term. See it and get blasted away."

","Snatch (2000): Dir: Guy Ritchie / Cast: Benicio Del Toro, Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina, Jason Statham, Alan Ford: The title seems to indicate a diamond going from person to person, or it could symbolize these subplots coordinating towards one goal. The story takes place in London with a boxing fight and a jewel that makes an unexpected journey into places that no man wishes to venture. It concludes with a lot of blood and violence poured within a game of greed and corruption. Directed by Guy Ritchie with the same skill he employed in Love, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. A rich cast ensemble includes Brad Pitt as a gypsy boxer with a speech impairment. After his mother is killed in an arson attack, he agrees to a fight where he demonstrates why you should never mess with the gypsies. Benicio Del Toro plays Frankie Four-Fingers, a failed gambler who ends up paying for more than his addiction. Dennis Farina is hilarious as Frankie's boss who treks to London in search of Frankie, and ends up touting one of the best declarations, ""Don't go to England!"" Jason Statham plays an unlicensed boxing promoter who, along with his partner, winds up in some tough spots. Alan Ford steals every scene he is in as crime boss Brick Top who has methods of enforcing his demands that often involve pigs. Seeking humour out of the depraved, it is a stylish example of criminology gone wrong. Score: 8 / 10"

","Snatch is Guy Ritchie's second feature film and a spiritual successor to his first film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. It has a similar style, setting and mostly the same cast from that film. With some filmmakers this could risk being repetitive and failing to live up to a previous success. But fortunately Ritchie seems to improve upon what he did in Lock, Stock in every way remaining loyal in style whilst creating a wholly original and hilarious comedy. <br/><br/>Its narrative is similar to something like Pulp Fiction, since there's no single plot that the film follows. Instead it follows many insane characters as they navigate the world of London crime and watch as their stories collide in to each other (both literally and metaphorically) as they try to do every crime from rigging boxing matches to stealing a 86 carat diamond. <br/><br/>And seeing these characters interactions is definitely the best part of the film. Watching their over the top personalities collide is like watching a dark British version of old Looney Tune cartoons. Even if this film had no plot at all, it could probably be sold on these insane characters alone. To match their larger than life personalities, most of the characters will also have weird but memorable names including Borris the Blade (Rade Serbedzija) a Russian gun dealer with the ability to dodge bullets and Brick Top (Alan Ford) a British gangster who rigged boxing matches and has an aggressive streak, chopping up any person who crosses him in to pieces and feeding them to pigs. <br/><br/>But no character in the film is quite as bizarrely enjoyable as Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt). He's a Irish Gypsy traveller who is a bare boxing champion with the ability to knock his opponents out in one punch. He's given an Irish accent that even an Irish man would find hard to follow at points, largely in response to criticisms in the first film that many of the London accents could be hard to follow for American audiences. So this character was made so both the audience and other characters couldn't understand him. And he uses this to his advantage, setting up unfair deals and swindling all the English men out of their pockets. <br/><br/>Even beyond the main characters, every side character are also very enjoyable. They seem to have a Coens Brother kind of charm to them when even if they were only on screen for 30 seconds, they kept you laughing so much in that short time that you'll still be able to leave the film thinking of them. Either because of the short dialogue having a distinct British charm to them or just because of great casting (like having a slow moving fat man as the getaway driver for a heist) that just ensures the characters all leave a lasting impression. <br/><br/>Another great part about the comedy in this film is Ritchie is one of the few directors to still use the visual medium effectively to bring the laughs in his comedies. As smart and quotable as the dialogue in the film is (""Why do they call him the bullet-dodger?"" ""Cause he dodges bullets"") the films visuals are where Ritchie real skill takes over. The use of clever editing tricks like freeze framing on a stupid face or fast editing taking you off guard in a split second allows this film to have its own distinct mark on you.<br/><br/>Out of all of his films so far this is definitely Ritchie's career high point. Its impressive soundtrack, instantly quotable dialogue and memorable visuals are both very enjoyable and easily re-watchable. It's quite easily one of my favourite comedies to come out in years."

None of the characters seemed conventional this time around. Ritchie takes the formula he used in his first film, and creates new, hilarious angles on them. Creativity wins in the end. We follow two mob groups, and they all intersect and scrap up within the final act of the film. There's boxing, and jewel thievery, and everyone trying to get the job done without being fed to hungry pigs (literally). While his last film was a tribute to Tarantino, this film, to me, seems like a parody of him. It works better, knowing that conventions are being made fun of, in cool ways."
"troyputland","8","0","2","8 June 2015"," Better than Lock, Stock?
","Snatch is Guy Ritchie's second British masterpiece, taking the good out of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and creating a movie to match it. The narrative is hugely similar; the black comedy still pushes the envelope with brute force, a solid script delivers an intricate cast of gangsters, thugs and druggies fighting over one item: a priceless jewel. What's new? Brad Pitt as an Irish gypsy. His accent's incomprehensible, an exaggeration on a stereotype we all love to hate. Ritchie knows his British stereotypes, from the gypsy's and the hooligans (Vinnie Jones), to the cockneys (Alan Ford) and the greedy American (as the British see them). Ritchie does crime and slang like no other. Snatch is a tangle of great stories driven by a single outcome (think 2004's Crash). It's hilarious and just as good as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, if not better."

If that is so, this film can probably also be considered more ""cheesecake"", since it is about as close to pure entertainment as I can imagine getting. <br/><br/>I pity the person who has to discern a moral or life lesson from this story, because if you can find one, you're probably wearing a tin foil hat; however, this film is compelling, fast-moving, witty, and clever (not to mention, violent), although it seems very much aimed at a male audience, given a complete absence of significant female characters. <br/><br/>This film is very much the guy equivalent of the notorious and legitimately feared ""chick flick"", although the plot is significantly less predictable (and less hackneyed, in this case). <br/><br/>The way I'm going to rationalize this is that a piece of cheesecake now and again is fine, it's just not the thing you want to base a nutritious diet on."

","Guy Ritchie's endlessly quotable crime comedy caper is such a joyous watch that it's not hard to see why it has become the renowned genre classic that it has established itself as today and is testament to the skill of Ritchie as a filmmaker that went missing for decade or so in the 2000's only to return once more when he took control of a certain well known British staple.<br/><br/>Snatch is one of the finest ever examples of an ensemble comedy piece, every character both large or small feels totally brimming with life and personality and every single actor brings their A-game to material that must've been a blast playing out. Ritchie's script offers something new each time you watch the film, as it's witty and sarcastically tinged undertones keep the film fresh even to this day. It's a real credit to the makers of the film that a seemingly simple story of a particularly large diamond, some wannabe boxing promoters and a deceptively smart bunch of Pikie's works to the level it does. While Ritchie's direction is energetic and smooth, skills he would virtually perfect with his stylish Sherlock films, it is his direction of his actors which is arguably the biggest reason behind Snatch's success.<br/><br/>It would be worth bringing up that action staple Jason Statham has never been better, his Turkish a character that remains his most memorable. Statham is both funny and appealing in his role and whether surrounded by the then up and coming Stephen Graham as his business partner Tommy or the vile yet incredibly memorable Alan Ford as the evil Brick Top, Statham is on excellent form. While Statham may be the glue that holds the story strands together every actor and their respective creation gets a moment to shine. Fantastic bit plays are produced by Lennie James as store owner Sol, Vinnie Jones as the tank like Bullet Tooth Tony and Rade Sherbedgia as determined Boris The Blade all shine but all are overshadowed by one of Brad Pitt's most memorable incarnations in the form of bare knuckle boxer Mickey. The way in which Pitt earned his role in Snatch is now a thing of legend and his barely understandable yet utterly awesome unwashed Pikie is a joy to behold and it's a credit to an A-lister to appear in such a low key production.<br/><br/>A cleverly constructed and thoroughly entertaining film, Snatch is without a doubt one of, if not the crowning achievement in Ritchie's filmography. With one of the funniest comedic scripts in recent cinematic history and with a raft of memorable and unique characters, this is British film at its most recommendable and ridiculously entertaining.<br/><br/>4 and a half anti-aircraft weapons out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check into - <br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

","Snatch, this is the first time i see a Guy Ritchie's film and i did enjoy it a lot. And i gotta say it hooked me into watching more of this director. The movie it's all about an underground crime world, that starts with a simple diamond and it gets to store up all of the different character into one simple story. All of the characters are amazing you just can't choose one as your favorite one but i loved Brad Pitt's persona it was simply the funniest character, i would of liked to see more Benicio Del Toro's acting, badly he dies too soon. The narration has an amazing dialogue by Jason Statham with his Scottish accent which i find really fun to hear. This is if i could say without watching any more of his movies Ritchie's pulp fiction, the movie has the same concept but it's totally different and of course worth watching 8/10 for me, Thank you for reading my review."

","Everything about Snatch is perfect. The casting, script, storyline, creativity, editing, soundtrack and direction are all outstanding. I literally do not have a single fault with this movie, to me; it is one of the greatest examples of how a film should be made.<br/><br/>The casting is brilliant, every actor transforms themselves into their character superbly, and there isn't a single actor who doesn't give a convincing performance. Snatch is so successful thanks to its flawless script, every scene is perfect with countless memorable one liners such as: 'In the quiet words of the Virgin Mary... come again?', 'Protection from what? ""Zee Germans""?', 'I'm sorry, I couldn't get the bin-noc-u-lars out in time' & 'You'll raise Hell. Never mind pulses'. It is hilarious one moment & tense the next.<br/><br/>There are two plot points in the movie, the chase of an extremely valuable diamond and the organisation of an illegal underground boxing fight. It is a story that involves a boxing promoter, a fat getaway driver, a wheeler dealer who pretends to be a Jew, a diamond dealer, a gangster who feeds his victims to his pig farm, an aggressive Gypsie, a hit-man and a sneaky f****** Russian!<br/><br/>The pace of this movie is spot on; it doesn't slow down from the first second to the last. There are so many different characters and the story switches between them often but not once do you get confused, which is usually very hard to achieve. It is so well made and the characters are that convincing and have so much depth that you feel for every single character. They are all likable in their own way. You can tell this is a Guy Ritchie movie straight away, his directors style is shown off to its fullest here. The camera angles, the edits, the sound effects & the soundtrack are all done to perfection. The Soundtrack is fantastic, so many brilliant tunes are included and they are picked carefully so nothing feels out of place.<br/><br/>When you mix great actors, with fantastic characters, give them a faultless script and let Guy Ritchie direct the whole thing, you are bound to create something special. I cannot stress to you how good this movie is. Go and watch it, now!<br/><br/>10/10"
"GeorgeRoots","8","0","3","15 October 2014"," Much Better Scripted Than The Average Modern British Gangster Movies.
","""Snatch"", could possibly be the best of its kind as it is still often hailed and quoted today by many people. I can think of plenty straight to DVD releases that come out in Britain, and feel that just because you have a gun in your hand and a slightly off-putting cockney accent you'll be able to separate yourself from some pretty formulaic trash. Guy Ritchie has managed to construct something familiar like his previous work ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" (1998), as well as continue his distinctive visual style and dialogue heavy wit.<br/><br/>Containing two intertwined plots. One deals with the search for a stolen diamond that many want to get their hands on, whereas the other features a small-time boxing promoter who finds himself pressured by a ruthless gangster. The storyline is always eventful, and half of it always feels like it hearkens back to old comedy films. That's not really a bad thing and to be honest, it does help bring out the opportunistic greed of every character.<br/><br/>The final thing to mention is how well casted ""Snatch"" is. By far the only reason to see this movie is Alan Torn's performance as foul mouthed, pig obsessed character Brick Top. You can't help but love a bastard so rotten, yet can hand your arse to you with the most philosophical nonsense ever. Heavy hitters like Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro and Jason Flemyng shine, and everybody else does admirable work whether your a fan or not.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: When all is said and done, it has a great soundtrack and definitely remains worth seeing this ensemble cast succeed and fail their goals. 8/10."

","The story opens up curiously then continued to an even more curious yet racially suggestive sequence that surprises the viewers and reveals the movie's true crazy nature. The rest of the three separate yet somewhat linked stories are built very nicely with all those crazy violence all around. What I really like about this movie is that there's virtually no moment that I wasn't laughing, or at least giggling, around the entire movie. The whole elements are really funny; the character and story backgrounds, the coincidences in the story development, the crazy dialog lines, and just about everything. The ending is also nice that it's quite unpredictable. Well, the action itself is quite predictable, but how the thing will unravel is not really so predictable. The acting is very nice here. I really like how Brad Pitt does his crazy accent. It's too bad that Jason Statham didn't get any action part in here."

","""My name is Turkish. Funny name for an Englishman, I know. My parents to be were on the same plane when it crashed. That's how they met. They named me after the name of the plane. Not many people are named after a plane crash. That's Tommy. He tells people he was named after a gun, but I know he was really named after a famous 19th century ballet dancer. ""<br/><br/>It's not everyday you come across a film like Snatch. The last time I watched an excellent crime film that didn't take itself seriously it was Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction. Whilst not as good as it, Guy Ritchie's Snatch is definitely a brilliant film. Pulp Fiction was outstanding, and revolusionary when compared to other 'gangster' flicks. The biggest change was the introduction of the mobius strip-style plot line, where the concept of time is no longer linear, instead constantly folding in upon itself, flitting between past, present and future that forces the viewer to pay close attention lest they miss some subtle detail. Inevitably, numerous copycat films emerged that tried to capitalize on Tarantino's success, but it wasn't until 1998 when Guy Ritchie, an unknown British director, took on the challenge and directed Lock Stock and Two Smoking barrels, to critical aclaim. I haven't seen Lock Stock, but after watching Snatch I am really looking forward to it.<br/><br/>The story revolves around some boxing promoters, a Russian gangster, dopy amateur robbers, a 'Jewish' jewler, and pretty violent bookmakers all in pursuit of a stolen diamond. The film moves pretty fast, and it's difficult to remember who's who in the beginning. However, once it settles, the movie runs smoothly and becomes very enjoyable. The film reveals that it chooses style over substance very early on, so watch it for what it is, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it a lot.<br/><br/>The credits, sound track, production, casting, writing, photography, editing, acting, and direction were all perfect. I was especially impressed with the freedom of the use of the camera. Slow-mo, stills, black and white, and color were all used to brilliant effect.<br/><br/>Each actor is full bodied, receives ample screen time, and no one character is the centerpiece. With so many talented actors, it is difficult to pick out one performance that stands out: Rade Serbedzija is hilarious as the mad Russian who blithely burns through each of his nine lives, as is Vinnie Jones' manic gentleman hit-man. On the other end of the spectrum, is Alan Ford as Brick Top, the promoter with a penchant for pigs, who epitomizes cold-blooded viciousness. Even a dog plays a funny and very important role. So many memorable, funny, cool, and dark characters with induvidualised personalities. I've never been the biggest Pitt fan, but he really brings this film extra life as the yabbering Mickey O'Neil. Apparently people were annoyed because they couldn't understand some of the characters in Lock Stock,so Ritchie decided, what was better than to have a character that both the audience and the characters wouldn't be able to understand. Turkish's hilarious narration sums up O'Neil's speech perfectly: ""It's not Irish, it's not English, it's justÂ…pikey"".<br/><br/>I don't have a single complaint on the film. If I was forced to make one, it would probably be (SPOILER!) why did Del Toro have to go so early! And possibly a couple of exaggerated accents.<br/><br/>Final World: Insanely crowd-pleasing! From pulling stupid faces when you think you're going to die to finding a dead guy with a tea-cosy wrapped around his face, Snatch doesn't spare you a dull moment. Very few films can make me laugh like this one can.<br/><br/>My Rating: 8.5 /10"
"eric262003","9","0","3","25 August 2014"," Gypsies Tramps and Thieves And One Dog
","Following through the success of ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", Guy Ritchie may have very well outdone himself here. What usurps this film compared to Ritchie's previous outing is that ""Snatch"" has more comedy provided. And even though there are more characters provided the story is far more easy-going.<br/><br/>Our journey begins with a boxing promoter named Turkish (Jason Statham) and his business accomplice Tommy (Stephen Graham) are privately talking about diamonds. As the credits get underway,in Antwerp, Belgium we see four thieves going incognito as Jewish men as they make their ways to the eighth floor of a building. Once they reached the floor, the thieves now have possession of an 84 carot diamond. The leader, Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) leads the troop as he delivers the diamond to his cousin Avi (Dennis Farina). He has days to spare in London where he's asked to meet Boris the Blade (Rade Serbedzija) to obtain a gun from him and place a bet on a crooked boxing match. Franky handcuffs his hand with the diamond placed on his hand in a briefcase, when suddenly the van was hit and he was out cold.<br/><br/>In another subplot (that spells Tarantino), Turkish and Tommy have signed on a gifted, but brainless boxer name ""Gorgeous"" (Adam Fogerty). Turkish and Tommy purchased a caravan from a band of gypsies, oblivious to the fact that easily breaks down the minute they purchased it. While demanding for a refund, George demands a fight with ""One Punch"" Mickey O'Neill (Brad Pitt) and if he wind they will get their refund. But Mickey easily knock out George, which leads to Turkish negotiating with Brick Top (Alan Ford) if they recruit Mickey in exchange for George. But will only do it if Mickey goes down in the fourth.<br/><br/>The third subplot has Boris not being able to get any communication from Franky, so he asks Sol (Lennie James) along with Vincent and Tyrone (Robbie Gee and Ade) to get in touch with him. When they finally reach him, he's been shot unintentionally and tribulations come into full effect when the dog enter the fray.<br/><br/>The performances were overall very enjoyable. Jason Statham has one-upped himself here and plays a more prominent role here. Brad Pitt is really fascinating as a gypsy who talks incoherently. Alan Ford truly was delightful as a crime boss and Benicio Del Toro was remarkable as a thief who suffers from a horrible gambling addiction. He truly makes up for his role, even though it's quite limited. Ritchie's direction has improved greatly from ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". The shots delivered are more bigger and the boxing scene is very well produced.<br/><br/>The script was quite impressive in humour and wit. The story may have numerous subplots, but it flows along very easily and is not hard to follow. It's also very rewarding to see it many times and it never gets stale, plus you see new things through every viewing. It's good that three cast members from its predecessor returns a second time through.<br/><br/>Like ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", the soundtrack has a variety of songs like old school Jewish music to more modernized (at least early 21st century music) like Oasis. What steps up in ""Snatch"" is the quicker pace and the action never once slows down and never overdoes it with the plot twists. I think between the two Guy Ritchie films, this one is much more compelling. The key component to why it's better is that there's more characters to get to know and you have a better understanding to where each one of them is coming from. The only gripe I have with this movie is the length. It's a bit too short. And it's not a burden to the film, but many characters who I enjoyed didn't get enough screen time, so I was hoping it would have been longer.<br/><br/>This movie overall, stands out for a near perfect film. Even for a heist movie, the performances and the script also stood out. The plot is enigmatic as one subplot overlaps with another like ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". Even though the setting of the movie is in London, England and a bit in Antwerp Belgium but wouldn't it be cool if it was set in New York? What more can I say? Watch the film, I guarantee you won't be disappointed."

","Well I'm not afraid to admit it, I have to watch Guy Ritchie's films a couple three times to really understand what's going on, and keep a scorecard to boot to keep track of the players. Just like ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"", there are multiple sets of characters here who take turns at center stage in a quest to wind up with a stolen diamond. I'm not going to give it all away here, if you like this kind of stuff you'll eat it up, and if you don't you won't. What keeps the flick moving are the talented players portraying widely disparate characters, like Benicio Del Toro's Frankie Four Fingers and Brad Pitt's pikey, oy crikey Mickey (probably should have been Mikey for the rhyming possibilities). But the guy who really entertains here is Englishman Alan Ford as the bug eyed gambling thug known as Brick Top. He's creepy as hell and has that train wreck quality of style that makes it impossible to keep your eyes off of. Granted, the film is filled with multiple four letter expletives beginning with the letter 'f', but presented in director Ritchie's inimitable style, the word is less obscene than one might ordinarily expect. Colorful would be another way to put it. Brad Pitt is hilarious as well with his Irish gypsy accent and mannerisms, and when push finally comes to shove, it's Mickey's merry band of hooligans who come out on top, even if they don't get the diamond. To find out who does, you'll have to catch the film.<br/><br/>One question - who thinks Boris is really dead?"
"willcundallreview","8","0","3","15 April 2014"," A smartly put together crime adventure
","Rating-8/10<br/><br/>Snatch is a gangster film full of dodgy deals and of course crazy gangsters, from the mind of a true gangster film legend, Snatch manages to bring together a big cast and put them to good use whether they be an Irish bare knuckle fighter or a very crazy mob boss Snatch uses them all. I felt this film was just about a great and excellent movie, and here below is why.<br/><br/>The story is smartly done and for a gangster film it is quite surprising as many would just have big gun fights and little dialogue, but because this is a comedy too the film contains some great lines and can be thoroughly enjoyed all the way through. I especially enjoyed the ending which was well done and all the build up to the end is crafted very well too, the film has no ""slow"" parts but can become a little repetitive in the middle part, but I think the ending puts an end to any parts that are less fun to watch.<br/><br/>Jason Statham puts in a performance that is hard to judge, on one hand the character may seem un emotional, or maybe Statham was just being a bad actor here, but in any case it doesn't ruin the movie and goes quite well actually. Brad Pitt as the Irish boxer is hilarious and with his fast words to match his punches he makes this film flow nicely and makes it more fun than it already is. The cast is full of great faces from those who play Cockney traders all the time to New York mob bosses, the film has all the elements that a London based crime film needs to be great.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie over see's the entire project with style and grace and manages to yet again make not the first but the last of his epic gangster works. The script is one of the highlights of this film with such good lines and even words I swear he makes up, Ritchie delivers yet again and maybe even matches his work on ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". I liked the fighting as it seemed intense and real and even certain deaths kind of make you feel slightly disturbed as to the reality of the corpse's. <br/><br/>The film is a bit simple it is fair to say and although I have praised the ending on this, the plot it follows is nothing new and sometimes even seems similar to Ritchie's past work. Some violence can seem unnecessary and only there to add a fear factor but I will stick by my rating that this film is a great film as I did truly feel the plot is smart toward the end, the acting is solid and overall it is fun and best not to just pick at constantly.<br/><br/>Those who love a good gangster film will love this as it contains all the elements and packs a real punch that should make viewers enjoy it all. Film goers who like a kind of action movie with a comedic twist will also enjoy as it contains hilarious things at times with some truly great fight sequences that can put you on the edge of your seat too. Those that won't like it, basically anyone who dislikes gangster films or bloody violence, it is more of a rating thing I feel.<br/><br/>I give this a 8/10, just about a great film, nowhere near superb but also far away from just being a simply good film, is it excellent. With this if you watch with a little cheeky smile you will surely enjoy this and even the horrific threats used throughout this film still don't seem to add much effect to your sense of enjoyment as it is all tongue in cheek. I believe Ritchie truly delivers here what we want to see, some more work in the future from Ritchie too because judging by this film , he is one smart writer and director."

","This film, Snatch, is an incredibly crazy and rather complicated film. But also this film is wildly entertaining and despite it not being like your average jewel heist film, it's hard to put down. This film has everything from gangster violence to gun-filled action to laugh-out-loud comedy. The dialogue is extremely sharp and pretty funny. There are stand-out performances by everyone especially Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie's film could be seen as a simple, but layered story. The movie follows a group of people from a Russian gangster to a pair of boxing promoters as they try to recover a valuable jewel. This story is significant because every character in this film has one way or another to do with this jewel.<br/><br/>The acting is very good in this film. I think Brad Pitt delivers a crazy performance as the very fast-speaking Irish gypsy. His accent really is the joke of his character. I think the best overall character is played by Jason Statham. Usually not in comedies, he has some of the best scenes and I love how he always gets on his brother's tail a lot.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a wildly entertaining film. If you did not like this film, I urge you to watch it again because I think it may need a second viewing. Guy Ritchie has been known for his crazy but funny films and obviously Snatch is one of them. It's a perfectly funny and thrilling British film and one of the best to come from that country. I rate this film 9/10."

The movie follows a boxing promoter and his accomplice along with three petty thieves trying to recover a large diamond for their ""employers"" for lack of a better word. This movie doesn't include plot twists, but as I watched it I thought to myself on several occasions, ""I didn't see that coming."" Among the unexpected turns, the film's cast compliments the quirkiness. Jason Statham and Vinnie Jones steal every scene they're in. The only problem I had with the movie was not understanding some of the dialog because of the characters' thick accents, but I still understood it.

","Snatch is a fixed up cocktail of just the right ingredients. From the unlucky underground boxing manager (Jason Statham) to the inarticulate fighting gypsy (Brad Pitt) to completely incompetent jewel thief's, these guys make up a cast of characters that are utterly hilarious when put together. <br/><br/>The witty dialogue makes the movie what it is. I feel wittier just by watching it. As an American, its just amusing to hear these quick-tongued Brits go at it. Nearly every scene involves a quip or sly remark. Cop: ""What's in the car?"" Turkish: ""Two seats and a steering wheel."" <br/><br/>But beyond the cunning wit of the dialog, you have a story of a group of lowlifes, thugs, gangsters, hit men, and gypsies all trying to get the same thing, whether they know it or not. Although, its more like two completely separate stories are being played out simultaneously, but end up converging into one in the end. I won't get into how or why, you'll just have to watch it. <br/><br/>My only quarrel with the film is, if you've seen Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, you'll notice a lot of similarities between the two movies. In fact they're almost exactly the same in terms of general plot techniques. Even used some of the same actors filling similar roles. While this isn't enough to discredit this film, I actually think Snatch is far superior, it makes me wonder what Guy Ritchie was thinking."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","15 October 2013"," Guy Ritchie's Best Work To Date.
","Guy Ritchie's follow-up to his breakthrough feature may have the very same blood flowing through its veins that was present in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels but it nonetheless succeeds as yet another prime example of its genre(s) that offers significant upgrades in all filmmaking departments, further enhances the director's style & visual flair, and still remains his finest work to date.<br/><br/>Set in London, the story of Snatch follows multiple segments concerning various characters who weave in & out of mainly two entwined plots. The first plot deals with the search for an 86-carat diamond that was stolen during a heist while the second one is about two boxing promoters who get pulled into the world of match fixing by a notorious crime lord. Things soon go from bad to worse, resulting in some unexpected outcomes for everyone involved.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Guy Ritchie, Snatch falls very much within the same universe as his debut film but it also shows the then-new filmmaker having a better grip at his trademarks and even his direction carries a more confident appeal. The screenplay brims with plenty of piercing dialogues, hilarious one-liners, crazy accents & memorable characters throughout its runtime and also exhibits precise control over its handling of the story's non-linear structure.<br/><br/>The technical aspects share many similarities with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels but benefit from a more polished execution. Cinematography features the same dynamic camera-work to capture all the action & unfolding drama. Editing is arguably its finest aspect for the final print is devoid of any dull moment, its 104 minutes of runtime unfolds at a terrific pace, and all characters gets their deserving screen time. Finally, the songs incorporated into the story is intelligently done for every track fits its accompanying sequence.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Snatch features a versatile cast in Benicio del Toro, Brad Pitt, Jason Statham, Alan Ford & others, and they all chip in amazingly well in their given roles. Although each one of these idiosyncratic characters have a vital role to play in the story's final outcome, my favourite of them all was the gypsy boxer Mickey, excellently played by Brad Pitt, for his nearly gibberish accent is hilarious as hell, screen presence is incredibly magnetic and thanks to Pitt's strong performance, he ends up stealing every scene he's in.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Snatch is a seamlessly intertwined amalgamation of stylish direction, smart writing, exquisite wit, perfect comic timing, zestful camera-work, immaculate editing, brilliant performances & bizarre soundtrack that takes its plot in all possible directions yet brings its story full circle in the end without leaving out any loose ends. An undeniable masterpiece, a timeless example of refined storytelling, and one of the greatest & funniest films ever made, Snatch is an unabashedly hysterical, extremely entertaining & immensely satisfying work of razor-sharp creativity that comes strongly recommended."

","Guy Ritchie delivers once again with a funny, thrilling, gangster film the way they are meant to be done. Jason Statham as 'Turkish', the unlicensed boxing promoter who gets pulled in over his head by the ruthless Brick Top (Alan Ford, an excellent performance), is brilliant. Vinnie Jones is also perfect as Bullet Tooth Tony in his interactions with the bumbling diamond heist in which it seems he is the only competent figure. I was a little disappointed by Brad Pitt though and would prefer in future if Ritchie would stick to the more authentic cast of Brit gangsters he normally uses who can at least get the accent right.

","I first heard about this movie when I was looking at the films I hadn't seen from the top 250 list and I read about this. I thought that it would be a very simple and boring movie. But when I saw it I was pleasantly surprised. Although the storyline is pretty simple, the way it is done is not as simple as it sounds. Most of the characters become involved with the diamond whether they like it or not.<br/><br/>But what makes this film so interesting. Well for starters the script is full of many funny comments. The acting is also absolutely wonderful. Especially Brad Pitt. Also the editing in some scenes like the milk drink scene keeps you guessing about how the scene will end. Then there is also the boxing scenes, especially the final one that is done by using a mixture of slow motions and still shots. And finally, there is the fun and exciting soundtrack that goes with it.<br/><br/>If you liked lock stock and two smoking barrels, then you'll love snatch."
"c-walls6","7","0","3","24 July 2013"," Great stylistic crime caper.
","Guy Ritchie's Snatch is a fun, snappy crime caper populated by flash geezers, psychotic gangsters and inept boxing promoters. The plot - involving a stolen diamond - is almost of secondary importance to the visuals and quickfire dialogue, but is helped along through devices and coincidences and propelled by Ritichie's now - trademark visuals.<br/><br/>This is very much a continuation in the same vein as Lock Stock . . and features some of the same actors including ex-footballer Vinnie Jones, Jason Statham and Alan Ford who has a memorable turn as the ruthless Brick Top. <br/><br/>Statham's boxing promoter Turkish and his dimwitted accomplice Tommy find themselves""on thin fackin' ice"" after a fight they rig doesn't go according to plan. Pikey bareknuckle champ Mickey O'Neill (Pitt) incapacitates their original fighter, thereby forcing them to use him in the match. Told to throw the fight, O'Neill instead puts his opponent down with one punch, incurring the wrath of Brick Top and placing them in the one place no sane person wishes to be - in Brick Top's debt. Meanwhile, three even stupider crooks attempt to recover the diamond from Franky (Del Toro) with hilarious results. <br/><br/>I'm from Ireland and find Mr Pitt's pikey/traveller accent hilarious. But, it suits the over the top tone of the film perfectly. The violence and the Cockney one liners are fast and furious. <br/><br/>I'm not going to go into much more detail, so I'll just say the film is extremely good fun and deserves a repeat view."

","A well done film with a cunning story line. With Benicio Del Toro only having a minor role, you know it's going to be a good movie. Brad Pitt has an excellent role with a hard to understand Pikey accent that would've been even harder to perform. The reason it's my favourite movie is the fact that it has multiple story lines that unite, like Pulp Fiction and humour that isn't cheesy but still makes you laugh. I'm continuously laughing but also intrigued as to what will happen next. With characters like Tyrone, Vinny, bullet tooth Tony and Tommy the laughs don;t stop. The swearing isn't over done and is used specifically for laughs and thats what makes it work. Snatch is currently my favourite movie and I don't see it changing anytime soon."

","SNATCH<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that I was never really interested in watching because I couldn't stand watching Brad Pitt. I was never a Brad Pitt fan... Until I made a deal with a friend of mine. He hates Tom Hanks, but I said he had to see Saving Private Ryan. He said he would watch it if I watched Fight Club. I watched Fight Club and loved it, he still needs to watch SPR... he is putting it off well. Since then I have grown to like Brad. He has made some great films.<br/><br/>Anyway... back to Snatch.<br/><br/>I thought it was brilliant. A great comedy with plenty of action. I really liked Lock Stock so am not really surprised that I liked this.<br/><br/>The film is about a diamond... a big diamond that it seems everyone wants. I would say the main character is a guy called Turkish. He is a boxing promoter, and a dodgy one at that. He makes a deal and fixes a match for a very dangerous man named Brick Top. Turkish gets a pikey named Mickey to fight for him as he knocked out his prized fighter, but Mickey does not like to play by the rules. Whilst all this is happening, there is still the small matter of the diamond that is being killed for by a few people and are chasing it around London.<br/><br/>The story is kind of all over the place, but it is great... it is not hard to follow and it has some great comedy moments in there. I was laughing at the situation and the reactions of the characters.<br/><br/>The cast list is also very impressive. It stars Jason Statham, Benicio Del Toro, Dennis Farina, Vinnie Jones, Brad Pitt, Alan Ford and Mike Reid. Yes, that's right... Frank from Eastenders. Everyone acts great in here. It is a proper cockney gangster story with a comedy twist. But this is definitely what you would expect from a Guy Ritchie film. It is as good as Lock Stock.<br/><br/>I will give this film 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>Very funny and with some great characters.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"

Tony picks up the pint, looks at it funny and drinks it anyway.<br/><br/>I love the characters in this film as well. Turkish and tommy are great together but my favourite duo is Vincent and Solomon. they are hardly the brightest criminal duo and when you add Tyrone in to the mix with them, they are just hilarious.

Brad Pitt and Rade Serbedija play brilliant, and imagine that both characters are against their origins.<br/><br/>The film has a very interesting plot. Some people compare it to Pulp Fiction. In my opinion, Snatch is a little more original, but I definitely prefer PF. However, Snatch can be considered a lighter version of Tarantino's breakthrough or even the British equivalent.<br/><br/>All in all, Snatch is an absolutely amusing film, both for its comedic and action scenes.

","Guy Ritchie's film ""Snatch"" has been one of the most interesting movies that I've seen in a while, to say the least. Written and directed by Ritchie himself, the movie had two major actors that I was familiar with off the bat; Brad Pitt and Jason Statham. Released in 2000, this film tells many different stories at the same time through the use of creative cinematography and storytelling elements. We follow the story of two unlicensed boxing promoters as they're ensnared in the underworld of diamond dealing. Throughout the movie, they come in contact with various characters such as ""Frankie 'Four Fingers'"" and ""Boris 'The Blade'"". As the movie progresses, our characters stories intertwine, until their paths coalesce into a single plot, involving all the different characters introduced throughout the film. I would recommend this movie for anyone that enjoys thrillers and action films."

","I know this is a really bold statement but Snatch is my favorite movie. The mix of Pitt, Stathom and Del Torro with the direction of Guy Ritchie works perfectly. The badassness mixed with the comic relief through the film is beautifully done. I love how all the story lines keep you guessing throughout the film and in one scene come together in a very unexpected way. The feel of the film reminds me of a Tariteno film with more of a MTV feel which works well with the storyline. The sarcastic and dry British humor keeps the laughs going without venturing to far from the dark somber feel of the plot. It shows how greed and make and break you all in the matter of a week.

I love that Ritchie is loyal and uses mainly the same actors in all his movies. I admit I have a bit of a crush on Vinnie Jones and that I have tried and failed to memorize his Desert Eagle speech, which to me is totally awesome and probably the best scene in the movie.

And though it was entertaining and I certainly had a blast watching it, there's more a lot more in-store for the viewer.<br/><br/>Snatch is written and directed by Guy Ritchie and man does he do a good job in the director's chair, honestly I've never really heard of Guy Ritchie before seeing this movie and honestly I'm glad I can be introduced to him this way. The way the plot moves from one story to an other is owed a lot to Mr. Ritchie's directing job as well as the performances on the parts of: Brad Pitt, Jason Statham, Stephen Graham etc. All the events of the film unfold through different stories, characters, and perspectives that all center around the heist of an eighty-six carrot diamond the size of a fist; throw in Trailer Trashing Gypsies, Small Time Bank Robbers, Two Con Men Gone In Way Over Their Heads, A Jewell Smuggler, A Bounty Hunter, and The Mob and you have one hell of an interesting and entertaining crime film.<br/><br/>Something I truly admire about the film is despite being a comedy (which it can be debated as to whether or not it is) there are scenes of genuine suspense namely the scene when Brick Top Threatens the bank robbers. Suspenseful, Hilarious, Endlessly Quotable as well as Excellent film editing and terrific story-telling; Snatch has become one of my favorite crime films and one of my favorite movies period.<br/><br/>And despite your personal preference of whether or not it's a comedy it it undoubtedly one of the best British films of the 2000s."

","Marvelous movie. One of Brad Pitt's most impressionable performances, competing with his jaw-dropping role on 12 Monkeys. His character makes the movie, his mannerisms, his accent, his way of handling situations, his insane personality; every bit of his amazingly executed role adds up to the magnificence of the whole. <br/><br/>Another actor worth mentioning is Benicio del Toro. Apart from the fact that he is a puertorican just like myself (and we puertoricans take that seriously) , he plays an excellent role. This is evident because even though he is cut off half-way through the movie, the impact of the persona of the character he plays stays with us 'til the end. The acting performances of these brilliant actors make the movie. The plot is good, and very well set forth, but the characters displayed are simply wonderful.

"KineticSeoul","8","0","3","13 June 2012"," Many characters but it still works
","This has got to be one of my favorite Guy Ritchie movie. Now I don't really like all of his work but this is one of his best. This movie might not have that absurd and yet snappy dialogue and the level of humor compared ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". But the dialogue is still pretty cool and the other areas just got enhanced. Especially how it's more coherent and comes together in a more nicely wrapped package despite multiple different storyline of different characters. But it comes together much better in the end as a whole. This is one of those movie the more times you watch it the more you will appreciate this film. The way the characters act amongst each other is very entertaining to watch and what adds to the humor is the incompetence of some of the characters. In some movies it might get real annoying real easily, but in this it works. Jason Statham was a jewel hustler in real life before he became an actor and he portrayed a street hustler in ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". Anyways he was really good as one of the protagonist and fit the role really well as the narrator with his charismatic voice. Vinnie Jones is also back again in this, he plays the intimidating and yet engaging character really well. This time around he is more mean and merciless when he has to get his job done. Brad Pitt is in this and he plays a memorable and iconic character and is one of the character that Pitt would be well known for playing next to Tyler Durden. He is simply a scene stealer in this and not in a negative way either. There isn't really a distinct main character in this movie but instead has multiple characters that are interesting and actually fleshed out for the most part which is a hard task to do. Despite there being a lot of characters in this movie it all fits together quite well, just about every character has it's moment. Overall this is a great movie that is most definitely worth seeing. Especially for those that enjoy character driven movies with interesting characters.<br/><br/>8.3/10"

Unlike his ex-wife Madonna, Guy Ritchie actually has talent. He directs Snatch in a non linear fashion and with enough off beat dialogue to invite comparisons to Quentin Tarantino. <br/><br/>Benicio del Toro is jewel thief Frankie four fingers and he is in London to sell a huge diamond that he has stolen. He gets double crossed by gangsters who run a dog fighting ring and expand into boxing. Mickey winds up fighting for them and when they lose money due to the Irishman not taking a fall, all hell breaks loose. <br/><br/>Several kidnappings, killings and every crime known to man soon follow as Snatch becomes a full fledged, violent ride with a satisfying conclusion."

","Well acted, well directed and well written. Snatch entertains the viewer from beginning to end with a storyline that twists and turns, humour and plenty of action. A strong cast including Brad Pitt, Jason Statham and Vinnie Jones are all prominent and give strong performances. While Statham and Jones basically play the same character in this film and others like it (Lock Stock) Pitt shows his acting range by excellently portraying an Irish traveller. As an Irish person myself I felt the accent was a small bit off but it was certainly a very good attempt. Of course, this accent would have been difficult to perfect for any actor but Pitt makes an excellent stab at it and his mannerisms are spot on.<br/><br/>The in-your-face nature of this film is appealing and its quick paced scenes and dialogue keep the viewer interested from start to finish. Confrontations between the Irish travellers and the English gangsters are funny and well written as are the escapades of the three amateur criminals Vinny, Sol and Tyrone and their dog.<br/><br/>Overall the film is well produced and the exciting plot keeps you guessing until the end. 8/10"

","If you enjoyed Lock Stock etc you will definitely enjoy this follow up film from Guy Ritchie. In the same genre, with once again an intertwining of East End shady characters after the same goal, plenty of blood and guts, shootouts, and of course, humour! To me, compared to Lock Stock the story line and connection of the characters was a bit clearer to follow and it was pleasing to see Vinnie Jones have more dialogue as well. The funniest scenes were the three black guys in the car and also the attempt at robbing the bookies (especially when trying to escape through the door!). I was impressed with Brad Pitt's character and the fact that he was prepared to make the movie for a huge cut in fees (and I also notice his name was not top of the bill). If nothing else it is refreshing to see a big star be prepared to do a movie because they want to. The type of movie only the Brits can do - and don't they do it well!."

In this movie there are a bunch of thugs after a twenty-something carat diamond, and no one can seem to hold on to it for very long. A star cast guarantees wonderful performances and they deliver. The story by itself is great, but the cinematography makes the movie amazing. Especially during the boxing scenes, how the camera is slowed downed at just the right moment to see Brad Pitt flying through the air is classic. Not only that but the use of colors in the character's wardrobe no doubt depicts what a bunch of characters they are.

If you said yes to any of these films, you will like Snatch.<br/><br/>Snatch is about diamond heists and boxing, and robberies, and swearing. The plots are lightening quick, back and forth, tying into each other with events and characters. The overall story isn't the strong narrative, but it sets ups the reals draw: a cornucopia of characters.<br/><br/>You've got Turkish & Tommy, boxing promoters, and their fighter Gorgeous George. There's Franky Four Fingers, a gambling robber, as well as Doug the Head and his cousin Avi. We've got Bullet Tooth Tony, and the sinister Brick Top. There's robbers with their driver Tyrone, and a great group of Irish gypsies (pikeys), headed by Mickey, an indecipherable Brad Pitt. And there's more. The whole spectrum is here, some see more screen time than others, some deserve more time, others less. If your cup of tea is a massive roster of criminals yelling at each other, Snatch may be your favourite thing ever. <br/><br/>So the plot is a nonsensical modern British noir, the dialogue is fast, furious and hilarious, the pace is constantly running, and Brad Pitt is great. What could be wrong? Not much, except that if you've seen the films I mentioned at the beginning, you may get the 'been there, seen that' feel. Snatch is a great film that takes great ideas and puts them together in one place. Some may overlook this more than others, but I could not. I haven't even seen 'Lock, Stock', this films' precursor, and it feels worn in. and It's ultimately derivative, and not even the British flair and Mickey the Pikey could make it unique. <br/><br/>Also, the broad range of characters and stories does lead to a loose structure and a 'go with it' style plot. It's all crammed into a 1 hour 40 minute film, so pacing took priority over fleshing out, but that's a personal gripe.<br/><br/>Snatch is a fun and funny movie with lots of style, but not all of that style is its own. If that doesn't bug you, you'll love Snatch. 8.3/10"

","Here is a movie I never cease to enjoy, the colorful characters, wittiest dialog ever and winding plot are the best. I wish Guy Ritchie would make more films like this, I know others have attempted, but few come close. Although Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is fantastic as well. I was steered away from the film because of the title, but once you watch it, you'll understand why the name. Brad Pitt's performance is one of his best albeit a small role, and this breakout role for Jason Statham is the reason he is a major star today. There are other great characters like Bullet Tooth Tony by Vinnie Jones and other characters that will be hard to forget. I think if I could wear out a DVD, this is one that has been put through the paces. Anyone who has seen this is likely to have seen it a few times, and if you are 'movie guy' can likely quote at least 10-20 lines from the rich dialog."

I'd rather watch the awesome THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN for the third time instead! So, I'm a fan of just the two first Ritchie films. <br/><br/>I have seen SNATCH countless times, on VHS, DVD and now finally on Blu-Ray (I think the first time was back in 2003). Actually I watched it on Blu-Ray almost two weeks ago, when I wanted to share this great movie experience with my girlfriend and realized I just had it on the now completely obsolete (at least in my house) VHS format. I also realized it had been years since I watched it for the last time, so certainly it was the right time to bought it on Blu-Ray and watch it again. I was actually exciting to do it, and was not disappointed. It's still the movie I love.<br/><br/>The quality of the Blu-Ray image ain't the best. It doesn't look as clear as some others, and maybe this is an indication that the movie won't age too well in terms of its style. But I don't really know, and the main thing here is that SNATCH is truly great stuff. As fast-paced as not many, Ritchie's second feature offers a performance that is as superb as underrated. I'm talking about Brad Pitt's one. Obviously Pitt is as acclaimed as he really deserves, and his bodywork, which even includes now a work with Terrence Malick, is something anyone will admire in the future. For me his performance in SNATCH, as a crazy as f*** gypsy, is one of his very best and one of the best things about this movie in general. I can't imagine myself recommending this movie without saying something about Pitt's awesome performance. The way he talks is the key thing certainly, and that talent was later reprised in his role in Tarantino's -Ritchie's ""rival director""- 2009 masterpiece INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS and in Malick's THE TREE OF LIFE. So, Pitt alone makes this one worth to watch. <br/><br/>What happened to Jason Statham also? I mean, I was also a huge fan and even watched some minor movies (like CRANK, CHAOS and THE BANK JOB) just because of him. Damn, right now I don't even know by name the stuff he has been in recently. It happened the same as with Ritchie: all of those movies with Statham are, if entertaining, completely forgettable, so my interest went away! I'm not even a real fan of his Transporter movies so I also stay with his two first ones. Here he ain't the action hero, but a fairly normal and clever boxing promoter dealing with all the dirt that surrounds the world of illegal sport. And he's name is just Turkish, so is all pretty darn cool. The great partnership he has with his friend Tommy is not the only one of the movie. We have from some of the worst and fattest -and most hilarious- criminals ever to some of the toughest and craziest! All too damn memorable to go for the details so you better check out this fantastic movie and have a fun blast!"

","At the very centre of Snatch is an 80+ carat diamond, but there is a hell of a lot moving around in its orbit.<br/><br/>The story starts with the diamond heist by a crew headed by Frankie Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro), in a clever sequence that follows – via security monitor screens – the would be thieves as they move through the building.<br/><br/>The plot then largely builds towards an unlicensed (read ""rigged"") boxing match, with the purchase of a caravan at one point introducing new characters and providing new twists and turns.<br/><br/>But almost everyone knows of, and wants, the huge diamond.<br/><br/>Snatch features dozens of colourful characters from the underbelly of society, thugs, henchmen, conmen, promoters , thieves, hit men, heavies and just plain criminals. They sport names like ""Bullet-Tooth"", ""Turkish"" and ""Brick Top"", and seem to value all human life aside from their own lightly.<br/><br/>After a series of coincidences and unfortunate timing Turkish (Jason Statham) finds himself involved in finding a suitable replacement for an injured fighter for shonky promoter Brick Top's next event.<br/><br/>Brick Top is a legitimately hard b*stard, scared of no-one and capable of anything, he is blunt, brutal and vicious. His favoured method of disposing of his victims is chopping them up and feeding them to hungry pigs.<br/><br/>Turkish on the other hand is merely after a quick buck, and rather than disappoint Brick Top and find himself pig food he seeks out a gypsy hard man named Mickey (Brad Pitt) with whom the aforementioned caravan deal was brokered (unsuccessfully) by his gormless associate.<br/><br/>Mickey is skinny and looks outmatched by can take a lot more than one punch, and is a bare knuckle boxing expert. Also being a gypsy we are lead to believe that he and his crew should probably not be trusted in any situation.<br/><br/>The plot is quite circular and has far more characters than I have described, with the action moving around as things develop and as they interact. As always with Guy Ritchie films the soundtrack is uniformly excellent, with the instrumental tracks being exceptionally funky in this case.<br/><br/>Having so many characters means that it is impossible to play favourites, and over the course of the film many of them indeed get picked off, especially near the conclusion as everyone nears in on the diamond which goes through more hands than a bottle of Courvoisier at a hip-hop album release party (I was going to say Justin Bieber at a pedophile conference but got cold feet).<br/><br/>The film has a high body count but aside from the boxing sequences most of the violence is confined to the offscreen kind, in fact some of the descriptions and dialogue are far more cringe-inducing than anything you'll actually witness.<br/><br/>Speaking of dialogue, while the plot of Snatch is probably a step below that of Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels the dialogue is perhaps more rich and definitely funnier this time around. Ritchie might benefit from picking a group of characters from Snatch and Lock, Stock, then just making film after film with them all interacting. He could introduce new characters and subplots along the way, and could save himself from making increasingly samey films with basically the same characters, just with different names.<br/><br/>Lock Stock was great, Snatch very good, but everything he has done since is average at best and often a lot worse.<br/><br/>Snatch works because at the time Ritchie had yet to exhaust what a group of nefarious underworld characters could get up to while swearing frequently and killing each other. Name actors agreed to appear in these new and exciting genre films because no-one else was doing it. In the years that followed though everyone jumped on the bandwagon and created their own bastardised rip-offs.<br/><br/>On top of all this and perhaps most unfortunate of all for Guy Ritchie, he had already taken his limited fame and used it to marry Madonna, thus tarnishing him in the eyes of the sensible even more.<br/><br/>He still gets to boast of two excellent films though, it is just a shame that he didn't get to make many more.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 8 / 10. It's quite Lock, Stock-esque, but that doesn't make it any less entertaining. A complex web of characters, clever dialogue and well choreographed events."

","I could not as for more from a film that what has been seen in Snatch. If you look at the ratings I've given there are only three films I have ventured to give 10 and this definitely deserves to be one of them.<br/><br/>The plot is confusing initially as are many Guy Ritchie films but stick with it and you won't be disappointed. A priceless diamond was stolen from Antwerp by Frankie Four Fingers who stops in London on his way to New York. Russian ex KGB turned gangster Boris the Blade attempts to set him up by getting 3 small time crooks to rob the bookies he is in in order to steal the diamond. The bookies belongs to local crime lord Brick Top who is also looking to use the gypsy Mickey in a rigged boxing match. I told you its impossible to explain but if I talk any more I will give away spoilers and don't want to give it away.<br/><br/>The acting is first class all round surprisingly. Jason Statham narrates the film as Turkish very effectively and performances from Alan Ford and Vinnie Jones stand out as some of the most convincing and the most hilarious ever seen in British film. You grow to love each character in their struggles.<br/><br/>The directing is superb and builds on Ritchie's previous film Lock Stock but definitely far surpasses it. This truly is British comedy at its finest and I am proud to have the DVD in my collection so see this film on my highest recommendation."

","Cinematic prototypes lean toward having an agelessness about them, an idiosyncratic appeal that exceeds years and settings. A relatively new model has been trying its frontier, the consciously stylized gangster. These incessantly stylish, exaggeratedly talkative, morally vague antiheroes have crowded the cinema backdrop. An exciting cross-reference to the question of whether or not the stylistically cutting-edge criminal is consistent and attention-grabbing enough to last is put into high-gear in Guy Ritchie's sophomore raid on the modern London gangland. Packed with jump-cuts, high shutter speed, a loud multi-generational pop soundtrack, harsh locales, style-sprayed dialogue and heaps of comic irony, Snatch. can be seen as the premier template for hyper-stylized testosterone cinema of and since the new millennium, except a closer going-over---and you'd not be in the minority if you gave it numerous---exposes something even more thrilling.<br/><br/>Snatch. is essentially a manic fusion, mongrelizing the Gen X and Y movie gangster with a varied range of archetypal potboiler constituents. Indeed, there are enough quaint, glib villains in it to give Mamet, Tarantino and even Scorsese at least a blip on the radar screen of their challengers, but at its core is a classic caper comedy. It's not ridiculous, actually, to picture Cary Grant playing Mickey fifty, sixty years ago were that heyday the time for this fast-paced amalgam of the underworld mythologies of the fixed boxing match and the diamond heist. Ritchie is the cinematic counterpart of a disc jockey, sampling traditional British thriller plotting and mixing it with ultra-modern atmospheric ingredients to form a witty and exhilarating mélange.<br/><br/>Ritchie's rearing in commercials and music videos give Snatch and its chronic freeze-frames a gasping pace, owing to cinematographer Tim Maurice-Jones and editor Jon Harris, who move heaven and earth. John Murphy's score lightheartedly varies on Jewish and Slavic formulas that sustains a tongue-in-cheek tone of buoyancy, at the same time the production design suggests one after another frayed London lower-class scene with stark naturalism. Ritchie keeps everything whirling frantically and cheerfully along, with all the audacious excitement of a bright kid intoxicated by the utter thrill of flying his own kite.<br/><br/>The chaotic, tricky plot is given its much-needed bookends by Turkish, an unlicensed boxing promotoer attempting to expand by dealing with formidable figures like many-tentacled crime lord Brick Top. In an effort to rig an impending match for Brick Top, Turkish solicits Brad Pitt's movie-stealing gypsy Mickey, who appears incapable of correctly taking a dive.<br/><br/>Across town, a flawless gem has been stolen by Benicio Del Toro's unassuming Frankie Four Fingers, who is expected to deliver it to America for Cousin Avi. Though, as one might imagine, there are snags: Rade Serbedzija's calculating Boris The Blade wants the diamond, and it's up to hired gun Bullet Tooth Tony help retrieve it.<br/><br/>As the film begins to unfold, the various cliques of characters appear to trail independent fates until Ritchie's cunning script lures them together in the last 40 minutes. Less domino-like in structure than Lock, Stock, Snatch manages these innumerable brackets of people and interlaces their paths. The dialogue is lively like its predecessor's, though cheekier instead of riotous, while composed in the same breed of Cockney Runyonesque.<br/><br/>The quality of more peripheral performances is conspicuously flimsy, but let's not lose sight of the overall upshot. The performances fluctuate in quality, but all are distinguished by a good-humored liveliness. Big splashes include Dennis Farina's frustrated American Avi, excavating a cornucopia of crass-American-traveler humor, Vinnie Jones' pokerfaced drollness as a more gentlemanly, if bullet-toothed, variation on his Big Chris in Lock, Stock, and Alan Ford's menacing eccentric Brick Top. Of exclusive reference is the impeccably cast dog that features more significantly in the action than we initially expect. Less flashy, but softly holding the whole lot together, is Jason Statham's bone-dry breakthrough as Turkish, who along with his sheepish partner, the memorable Stephen Graham as Tommy, gets more than he bargained for.<br/><br/>This indelibly quotable audience fave is far from faultless cinematic art, but it's an electrifying exercise and a halcyon cult-smash stand-out by Ritchie. For those who grieve for the old Ealing comedies or the farces of McCarey and Wilder, and don't disapprove of a spot of gunplay, blood spatter and dismemberment, or an immensity of profanity generously strewn throughout, this is a refreshing and stirring experience. May the post-modern gangster standard keep on coming, as long as they keep as imaginative, as hilarious and as absorbing as the hyperlink tapestry of Snatch."

","I watch crime and thriller movies but my taste for them is always limited as very few of them will reach through my mind delighting me. ""Snatch"" will rank the top in this genre. What a movie it is! The story is centered around the 84 carat diamond rolling in different hands! It starts slowly picking up a pace and holds the viewer right till it ends. The dialogues are awesome! I think the screenplay is written so carefully that it holds the meaning in every line. To not to loose any good lines I enabled the subtitles on, literally! Brad Pitt is good! Perhaps this one is one of the most liked character of mine so far. Jason Statham in a different style as well. The way the director and writer has given slight touch of humor just makes this flick watch worth and do not make it wrong in any way. In fact the humor has been taken care of so closely that it just don't spoil the original thrill and crime theme in it and balance the movie throughout. After I watched this one, I really felt being away from such a masterpiece for so long time. I mean the movie was made in 2000 and I got chance to watch it after 11 years! Overall, nice movie to go for an entertainment if you haven't watched it yet cause it will still give the same pleasure even if time changes and we are in the completely changed world!"

","A comedy/action/crime/thriller with a plethora of eccentric characters whose stories all intertwine. Can it work? Yes it can. Snatch is the second feature film from the uniquely spectacular visionary, Guy Ritchie. It tells the story of two partners who are getting involved in fixed boxing matches, a group of violent bookmakers, a slick and dangerous Russian gangster, incompetent amateur thieves, and allegedly Jewish jewelers who are all in search of a priceless diamond that was recently stolen. The story is a twisty, wacky, and all around nutty blast that is characterized more by its unique visual style than anything else.<br/><br/>Guy Ritchie has a very unique vision that he tries desperately to make work. The visual nuance of Snatch is cartoonish in a way. It is filled with tilted cameras, wacky close-ups, and exciting slow motion that twists the films humor around its sleek and suave attitude. The whole atmosphere of Snatch is a kind of faux macho-man feel. The characters look mean and act tough, when really they are a bunch of incompetent buffoons who only get anything done through sheer coincidence. It leaves an ironically hilarious taste in your mouth that is non-stop entertaining. It's the ambiance and visual flare that makes Snatch what it is, an awesome and fun filled ride that never lets up and never slows down the action.<br/><br/>Snatch is a ridiculously fun film with a very unique style and a plot that sits right under the very high bar that the visual style sets. There's nothing inherently wrong with th plot of this film, but it doesn't stand out and doesn't quite live up to the expectations that are immediately set from the very start of the film when Benicio del Toro and his gang get into a bank dressed as Hasidic Jews and then proceed to shoot the place up. From there the story gets rolling. It's a story that fits in with the wackiness of the film, but never really exceeds the visuals. It tries to be something more by being a very topsy turvy amalgamation of story lines and characters. But it fails to be the thing we remember about Snatch as it is constantly superseded by the great visual quality of the film, combined with a perfect soundtrack and great performances.<br/><br/>I loved this film. I really did. Visually, it is masterful. The story leaves something to be desired but I can't hate on it all that much, because it works. I get the feeling it was trying to be more than it was, but not so much that it hurt the overall impact of the film which was an impact that put a smile on my face. It's a great film that is non-stop fun and if you can't find something to love about this film then you are just a pessimist and don't deserve to watch a film like Snatch anyways."
"AlexMc1987","8","0","3","28 March 2011"," Guy Ritchie at his best
","Snatch is a brilliant, violent but often hilariously funny thriller about the lives of a gang of London low lives, as well as Americans, Irish travellers, Russians and the tough and shady world of underground boxing. I remember the film first causing a stir because of the casting of Brad Pitt against type as a rough Irish traveller and his supposedly incomprehensible accent. Pitt is brilliant as he hams it up but never goes overboard is a role that is a slight parody of his part in Fight Club. As with Lock Stock....Guy Ritchie keeps his cast of favourites and it shows, the acting is excellent from just about all concerned. Although for me as with Lock Stock.....it's Vinnie Jones who steals every scene he's in as the violent and menacing Bullet Tooth Tony. Alan Ford is also fantastic as the sly and shady Brick Top. Ritchie's assured direction never skips a beat, and his trademark camera-work is again on display, and editing techniques are second to none. Also the characters are wonderful and the script is first rate. The central plot is as old as the hills - criminals try to retrieve a diamond stolen from an Antwerp jewellers - but it doesn't matter. This is one the true gems of British cinema."
"xtian_durden","9","0","2","2 March 2011"," ""Less entertaining in the third time.""
","The first time I saw ""Snatch"" three years ago, I was intensely amazed. It's a unique fine film, one of a kind, but it was then when I haven't seen ""Lock, Stock"" and now that I've re-watched both films in order, I realized that ""Snatch"" wasn't the first film with this theme, although it was both directed by Guy Richie. So I've decided that they're equally great, and I'm putting it one notch below my original rating to be fair, but it will remain on my all-time favorite films and it will never leave that list. I very much enjoyed this film, but I must say it wasn't as exciting as the first viewing, it's my third time watching it. There are films that even though how many times you've seen them will still remain as effective and fresh like the first viewing, like ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Fight Club"" which I have repeated the most. And there are some films that are effective in the second viewing, like ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and ""Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels"" which I've re-watched recently and I was more into it than the first time, it's maybe because I wasn't in the right mood then. ""Snatch"" is still a clever film, a brilliant creation by a creative director, Guy Richie. ""RocknRolla"" is my highest rated Richie film, and maybe I need to watch it again and see if it's still as great as it was a year ago, the reason I loved it very much although it's now a familiar theme and it's only a recycle of his first two films, is because I missed the style and the almost-clever-more-lucky characters that he has in this kind of films. If Tarantino has ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" Richie got ""Lock, Stock"" and ""Snatch."""

"jusco15","6","0","2","24 December 2010"," jusco's review: Snatch
","Snatch is an eccentric, original film that combines both gangster and comedic elements to create a relatively successful and refreshing film ('original' is subjective; it's supposedly too similar to Guy Ritchie's previous film, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but then again I haven't seen that yet). The plot follows two interlinked story lines set in the London criminal underworld: one revolves around an attempt by several parties to steal an 86 carat diamond, the other about a boxing promoter and his unfortunate dealings with an unmerciful gangster. Despite the seemingly simple plot, the various twists and turns are surprising and even hilariously absurd. Think deadpan comedy with imposing guns and terrifically witty dialogue. It's like watching a slapstick cartoon come to life. Edited rather stylistically, contrary to the conventional theatrical manner, it moves at a faster pace than most films and has a cool, fitting accompanying soundtrack.<br/><br/>This film features an impressive ensemble of actors (I just now realise the lack of female characters; this is a 'manly' film). But the two standouts were Jason Statham and Brad Pitt, two widely-known actors; the former known for being one of the iconic 'action heroes' in films such as The Transporter, Crank and The Expendables, the latter known for being a 'pretty-boy-but-still-immensely-talented actor' in films such as Seven, 12 Monkeys, Fight Club, just to name a few. Imagine my surprise then at Jason Statham's impressive delivery of Guy Ritchie's brilliantly written dialogue. I was unimpressed with his action flick performances, but in Snatch, he proves he is capable of more than just throwing punches and shooting guns. Brad Pitt had an interesting character to play; how did he pull off so well an Irish gypsy (or derogatorily known as 'pikey') who excels in bare-knuckle boxing, is obsessed with his mum and whose heavily-accented words are completely indecipherable? One of my favourite of his performances.<br/><br/>Snatch thrives on the ability to entertain audiences with its unique deliverance, laugh-out-loud dialogue and outrageous happenings. However, that's as far as it goes. Halfway through the film, the dialogue starts to feel a bit stale and overdone, the style of editing is a bit vexing and the story seems to go nowhere. Some of the performances were mediocre, as if the actors were unable to grasp the true character they were tasked to play. This was one of the films where the entire journey failed to overrule the unsatisfactory ending. This film is smart, make no mistake, but Guy Ritchie shouldn't have overdone it for his own good."

","One of Guy Ritchies best movies along with Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. First of all it is very well written by Ritchie himself mixing action with humor. There are several laugh out loud moments which are combined with gratuitous violence. The movie also has an excellent British cast along with Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro who both play very funny roles. Pitt plays a gypsy who is also a very good boxer and has a very funny accent while Del Toro plays a thief who has a gambling problem. There are several other characters who contribute to the humor in the movie and each character intersects with another in one way or another. The movie is very entertaining and the ending is clever. There was a great parallel action sequence in which the dogs chased a hare while in the meantime a few gangsters were chasing a thief. Overall the movie was very entertaining, funny, and had great action scenes with very interesting and varied characters. I also think this is one of Brad Pitt's funniest performances."

I'd say it's probably the most hilarious movies that I've seen in a while. Nearly every line of dialogue gets laughs.<br/><br/>The story involves a VERY large diamond, unlicensed boxing, replica guns, gypsies, caravans, and a pig farm. Trust me, it's great.<br/><br/>Out of all the characters in the movie (and there are a lot), I'd have to say Brad Pitt as Mickey and Alan Ford as Brick Top are the two that absolutely stole the show.

Also the script is very well written in a way that it needed a tremendous effort to interrelate so many happenings and make something meaningful out of it at the end. But everything seemed to fall into place so smoothly that you don't even feel any glitch whatsoever.<br/><br/>Guy ritchie has not only recreated the magic of Lock stock and two smoking barrels, rather he took it one level higher. If you appreciate dark humour then it's a must watch for you. A warning though, don't watch it without subtitles. There are so many accents that you'll definitely loose the grip on the movie without subs.<br/><br/>All in all it's a 9/10 for me and I would recommend it to everyone.<br/><br/>My fav dialogue from the movie...<br/><br/>Brick Top: In the quiet words of the Virgin Mary... come again?"

","While my favourite film in this genre is still Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels this is nevertheless a thoroughly enjoyable British heist film. Without giving anything away the film is about the heist of a huge diamond and the convoluted and comic path it takes as it changes hands between various members of the British underworld. Jason Statham is as usual pitch perfect as is, surprisingly, Brad Pit whom I don't usually really love. The rest of the cast is made up of a collection of very well cast character actors, all of whom shine. Especially noteworthy is a wonderfully sinister and kooky mob boss played by Alan Ford. The exception to this is Benicio Del Toro who plays a suave, slick, gangster / hand off man. His fake Jewish / eastern European / who the hell knows what accent is so thick and off the wall that one can't help but laugh at his character (and not in a good way). Brad Pit's accent may be just as thick but he manages to pull it off in a wonderfully goofy way while Del Toro just comes away looking stupid. Thankfully he plays a relatively small role. Speaking of accent, accent plays such a central role in this film, both as comedic relief and general backdrop that one almost feels that it becomes a character in and of itself. Like many such films in this genre it's well worth a 2nd watch just to unravel it's complex plot and character interactions."

The film doesn't roll more than 5 minutes without a line that will make you chuckle are sticks in your head.<br/><br/>There a lot going on but not enough to make you confused.

","Snatch the second film which Guy Ritchie made is basically a bigger budget remake of Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels... however that is not a bad thing considering how good Lock Stock is.<br/><br/>Right from the start with Turkish introducing all the other characters and the shot of Turkish and Tommy sitting across the table it is obvious exactly who directed the film and that obviously makes Guy Ritchie an auteur.<br/><br/>The film is a fantastic mix of comedy, violence and swearing that are at the heart of proper British films, and from the start was laughing and enthralled in the drama and the twists and turns in the plot that happen in a way which is totally unpredictable and ironic in so many ways.<br/><br/>The performances are all very good but I have to say in this film Brad Pitt shows what a fantastically diverse actor he is and if before the film I would never have believed the Brad Pitt could play a Gypsy as convincingly as he did and his performance as to be the stand out.<br/><br/>As I say the only downside would probably that being such a big fan of Lock Stock parts of this movie seemed almost too similar which is a shame really because if I hadn't seen the former this film would be like nothing else I've ever seen and would probably getting a rating of 9 or maybe even 10 like Lock Stock.<br/><br/>Snatch a fantastic British film by a fantastic British director and is thoroughly enjoyable.<br/><br/>8/10"

","After the success of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Guy Ritchie quickly became hot property and a follow up film was expected. Ritchie decided on bringing the audience another comedy-gangster caper and he had the added clout of attaching big name stars like Brad Pitt and Benicio del Toro.<br/><br/>Snatch tells multiple but interlinking stories set in the London underworld. A 87 carat diamond had been stolen by Frankie ""Four-Fingers"" (del Toro) in Antwerp, Belgium. He is sent to London to have it evaluated by the diamond dealer Doug ""The Head"" Denovitz (Mike Reid), for an American gangster Avi (Dennis Farina). Frankie is a meant to stay low but his gambling habits play havoc on that idea. Turkish (Jason Statham) and Tommy (Stephen Graham) are organisers and promoters for underground boxing fights A ruthless gangster Brick Top (Alan Ford) recruits them and demands that their fighter throws the fight so he could make a killing for his gambling empire. When Turkish's fighter is unable to fight he is forced to recruit an Irish traveller Mickey (Pitt) to be his boxer: but Mickey does not play ball. Boris ""The Blade"" (Rade erbedija) also wants the diamond and he hires two hapless criminals, Sol (Lennie James) and Vinnie (Robbie Gee) to steal it from Frankie. But to do this they end up stepping on Brick Top's turf, who quickly becomes involve in the fight for the diamond.<br/><br/>Ritchie as a writer has a limited range as a writer, he often does these mockney gangsters with interlinking story lines, macguffins and over-the-top characters. He is often a man who thinks he is smarter then really is. But even with this formula Ritchie does make a fun film with a lot of comedy and the story elements fit well together. It shows a number of story lines can work if the writing is good. This is of course not a serious take on London gangsters which is a shame really because British filmmaker have made some real classics like Get Carter and The Long Good Friday. But as a comedy take it is still pretty good and there is plenty of action throughout. But there were some really silly things throughout like the names of some of the characters, the use of mockney English because no one speaks like that and the way some characters act throughout the film. Ritchie is stylist in his direction with some brilliant shots throughout and there is a visual kinetic style. The film is fast paced and Ritchie knows how to deliver a action, with the boxing fights and the gun fights. There are some moments of real flair like in the beginning when it uses CCTV screens to follow a group of robbers.<br/><br/>There is a excellent cast in this film. Of course the Hollywood A-Listers are good in Snatch, del Toro effectively playing a European gangster and it had to take an American actor to give an over-the-top Irish accent with the ultimate amount of slang. The Stath shows that from his origins as a model and a driver that he can be good actor and shows that he has some real comic energy in Snatch. Ford was very effective as the top gangster of London with a remorseless nature and James and Gee were decent comic folly.<br/><br/>A good film, but Lock, Stock is Ritchie's best."

","I enjoyed Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels a lot. It was original, funny and stylishly made. Snatch is funny and stylishly made but reminded me too much of Lock Stock. It has the Guy Ritchie trademarks of colourful character names, convoluted plots, slow motion sequences and hectic editing..and Vinnie Jones but I felt he was trying to much to copy the successful formula of Lock Stock.<br/><br/>Ritchie obviously used the success of his previous film to attract big name stars to the cast, notably Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro. Pitt is excellent as the fighting traveller who can't be beaten. Jason Statham returns as the ""hero"" and narrator. The plot deals with what happens how the worlds of illegal boxing and ""Pikies"" (travellers) meet. Many familiar faces show up playing the inhabitants of London's underworld.<br/><br/>Perhaps you would enjoy this film more if you have never seen Lock Stock. I'd definitely prefer the older film."
"Hitchcoc","8","0","1","22 January 2010"," Don't Take It Serious!
","This is a really funny movie. Obviously, the subject matter could be very serious. It is violent and decadent. Still, the interaction among its characters, from the guy who keeps losing his fingers, the three black men with the dog, to Brad Pitt and his mother, fried in her trailer. The plot is convoluted and intriguing. There are two issues: a huge diamond and boxing match that needs fixing. Sometimes when so many cooks are involved, the broth gets pretty strange. These guys are all at the top of their games, each looking over their shoulder to see when the next shoe will fall. It would be fun to see it again, knowing the relationships that developed throughout. There are delightful performances all around and we actually find some of the characters naive and rather playful. Still, money talks. it's no Pulp Fiction, but it has some real joy to spread, in a kind of sick way."
"Vishal_s_kumar","10","0","1","15 December 2009"," It's just that. Just a story.
","Snatch is shorthand for ""convoluted plot, unintelligible dialects, quirky styling, superficially gratifying, and wildly entertaining film-making."" Indeed, Guy Ritchie's 2000 follow-up to the fan-favorite Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels follows a familiar formula, delivering a picture that's not exactly coherent but not particularly difficult to follow on a base level. Fortunately, there's little to Snatch beyond the surface, making it easy to digest despite the many obstacles that keep it from being more readily accessible in a traditional narrative style. Snatch interconnects two major plot lines, neither of which are of any moral, spiritual, emotional, or otherwise philosophically important structure or value; instead, the film cares only about the visceral aspects of the violent, corrupt, and complex world it weaves, a world where anything goes, a tone that's reflected in Ritchie's haphazard and highly kinetic but wonderfully effective visual approach to the material.<br/><br/>Snatch follows two stories that interconnect by film's end: that of a stolen diamond and a series of fixed boxing matches gone awry. The former begins with the theft of a flawless and particularly large 86-carat gem by the skilled Frankie ""Four Fingers"" (Benicio del Toro), and he and the diamond become the object of desire by a broad spectrum of sleazy and unscrupulous individuals: American Avi Denovitz (Dennis Farina), hit man Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinne Jones), Doug the Head (Mike Reid), Boris the Blade (Rade erbedija), and assorted low-level goons. Meanwhile, illegal boxing promoter Brick Top (Alan Ford) has a rigged fight lined up, but when his underling Turkish (Jason Statham) sends Tommy (Stephen Graham) and boxer Gorgeous George (Adam Fogerty) to secure him a new camper from a group of ""pikeys,"" George is severely injured in a fight with Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), leaving Turkish and Tommy with no choice but to ask Mickey to enter the ring as George's replacement.<br/><br/>No matter the ins-and-puts of the plot; Snatch is more about the experience than the story, more about understanding the hows rather than the whys. Few films can succeed on style alone, and Snatch seems to go out of its way to prove itself the exception to that rule. Though its narrative isn't impossible to follow, it's moderately difficult for a myriad of reasons: borderline unintelligible accents, a plethora of main characters, varied motivations, interconnecting stories and fates, and a highly-charged and unorthodox visual style. All told, Snatch seems the epitome of a film destined to collapse under its own weight and convoluted collection of elements, but Director Guy Ritchie handles the entire spectrum of cinematic no-nos with tongue seemingly planted in-cheek, lending to the film a none-too-serious tone despite its dark and violent elements surrounding England's seediest Criminal underbellies and enterprises. Indeed, Snatch -- and Ritchie's other films -- is of its own personal style, a genre of its own, a film that can only be imitated but not duplicated, for few films enjoy such a mind-bendingly unique approach as this.<br/><br/>Snatch is a product of style, and as such, elements other than story prove more valuable to the experience, and the movie benefits greatly from its collection of talent found on either side of the camera. Guy Ritchie's direction is fluid, an organic ensemble of elements that give the film a life of its own, and it's complimented by a frenetic and terribly loud soundtrack that jumps into the mix and injects an additional jolt of energy into the experience. Together, the film's look and sound define the high energy concept, and both help in equal parts to energize a picture that otherwise suffers from the aforementioned issues that would seem to spell certain doom for a picture that dared take itself even the least bit more serious than Snatch. On the other side of the lens, Snatch's entire cast turn in memorable performances within the context of the film. The accents are thick but the dialogue is witty, and each character seems fully immersed in the film's helter-skelter style. Brad Pitt is particularly engaging as the ""pikey"" fighter Mickey O'Neil who encapsulates the entire experience, speaking with a particularly thick accent that even the other characters in the film have a hard time discerning, but he also makes for the most complex character that suffers greatly but also reaps a particularly handsome reward. Snatch also enjoys wonderful performances from a combination of name stars (Jason Statham, Benicio del Toro) and plenty of character actors at the top of their craft (Dennis Farina, Alan Ford)."

"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","1","5 July 2009"," Not quite as good as ""Lock, Stock..."" but definitely worthwhile
","""Snatch"", Guy Ritchie's follow-up to his surprise hit debut ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", contains many of the same elements that made his first film a hit. Again the story revolves around a wide range of criminals, this time from jewel thieves to Russian gangsters. There are two main threads to the plot: one following a number of individuals attempting to secure a valuable diamond and another following an unlicensed boxing manager who's gotten into the debt of a particularly ruthless promoter.<br/><br/>In my opinion the cast is a little better than the first film but again it contains no real standout performance. There is an authenticity to the performances, even that of Brad Pitt, who delivers my favorite performance of his to date. As with the previous film, those who have trouble with accents may find some of the dialogue hard to follow, especially in the case of Pitt's character (though he's meant to be scarcely intelligible).<br/><br/>The story contains a lot of the inventiveness of Ritchie's earlier film but here it stretches out a bit further by having a couple of plot lines running parallel to one another. Ritchie pulls it off and does so with the same comedic touches that marked his first film.<br/><br/>Ritchie's direction is once again well-handled and here he shows even more polish than before. He rarely goes overboard with style but the film's slickness isn't quite as fitting as his previous feature's somewhat ragged look. As for the soundtrack, it's solid though it hasn't got nearly as many high points as the soundtrack for ""Lock, Stock..."".<br/><br/>In the end, this film is likely to please fans of Ritchie's first film and fans of crime films in general. That being said, as you can see by all of the references that I made to ""Lock, Stock..."", if you're looking for something completely original this isn't it."
"shekhar-chill","9","0","1","3 July 2009"," One hell of movie!
","So today I watched this movie Snatch, directed by Guy Ritchie. What an amazing movie!! A delight to watch; I mean I had heard that movie but this good.I had never expected.<br/><br/>So the movie is basically about all these criminals trying to snatch things from each other. Story starts when a man named Franky Four Fingers smuggles an 84 carat diamond to London to sell to a jeweler on behalf of his boss. And then a lot of crooks and biggies get involved. And everyone is trying to snatch something from others; hence the name Snatch. Now this storyline may seem very familiar to you; and in a sense it shares some flavor with The Departed and Babel, but the real killer is the way story is told. I have got to give to Guy Ritchie. I mean what a comedy! The criminals in the movie are not white collar ones, they are the bums for whom crime, violence, theft, debauchery is a way of life. And each of them has his own idiosyncrasies; which ultimately screw him up at some point or another. And still all of them continue so nonchalantly through all the mess. And I just can't describe to you right now how great the way story is told is. One of the best I have ever seen. And the performances from all the characters are mind blowing. Especially the one from a character named Bullet Tooth. And as for me, it showed me the world in way I had never seen.<br/><br/>So I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes gangster movies in general and would like to watch a hilarious spin on it."

First of all the plot is much better and involving more characters with different interests. The direction was much better, with many colorful visuals. Just like in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels the characters weren't take to seriously (some of them weren't taken seriously at all), there were more funny situations, though to me Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels was still funnier.

"johnnyboyz","10","0","1","5 September 2008"," Ritchie out does his previous effort and provides us with plenty more escapist gangster shenanigans with Snatch.
","I can remember seeing Snatch. for the first time and being a little confused; it didn't help that I saw it on commercial television and frequently had the then what seemed to be complicated narrative broken up by advertisement breaks. Since then I've seen it several times, uninterrupted, and it's just the sort of film that grows on you. The film is funny, it moves at an enjoyable pace but includes its fair share of long takes cranking up the bizarre atmosphere it has and most of the scenes are accompanied with some brilliant dialogue. This is classed as a British gangster film, despite its post-modern touches, but I feel it can hold it's own up there with the greats of the genre in that respective cannon.<br/><br/>The funny thing with Ritchie's gangster films is that they rely on that message of entertainment. Ritchie's films are not about deranged and disgruntled post Second World War youths alá Brighton Rock and nor are they about fish-out-of-water individuals travelling to far off places to do battle against pornography and murder alá Get Carter  neither do they attempt to tackle issues to do with Britain as a whole such as the rise in prostitution (Mona Lisa) and globalisation twinned with the threat of the IRA (The Long Good Friday). No, Ritchie's gangster films carry an air of escapism rather than realism and very much keep the gangster in the world of their own, very much fixed on problems of their own.<br/><br/>In its essence, Snatch. is similar to Ritchie's prior film Lock, Stock in the sense its about a collection of individuals whom are in debt to a more powerful, more ruthless criminal. That criminal here is Brick Top (Ford) and he is much more menacing than Hatchet Harry. The persons in debt are Tommy (Graham) and Turkish (Statham), a twosome instead of a foursome as seen in Lock, Stock. Then there are the little connections you spot such as Boris (Serbedzija) being able to 'get anything you like' similarly to Nick the Greek in Lock, Stock and the visual approach of the fancy transitions and thoroughly amusing voiceovers.<br/><br/>Snatch. plays out like a noir infused electric shock; opening up with a voice-over in a gloomy room by the lead character and then hopping around sending us on a long and complicated journey which adopts a multi-strand approach. But this is not a pulpy detective story, even though it has several characters chasing a specific object, and it is not a study of seduction and betrayal. Snatch. covers a diamond heist and the resulting jewel getting mixed up in the crazy world Ritchie creates but more-so focuses on the two individuals of Turkish and Tommy in their ongoing struggle with Brick Top.<br/><br/>If the British gangster genre relies on gritty realism and hard as nails characters wading through a seedy and down right nasty location in search of the truth then Snatch. perhaps ignores this and adopts the aesthetic of escapism. Erratic subtitles shoot across the screen to the sound effects of mock pistols firing; split screen telephone conversations that pop up and retreat again when someone speaks and wired crash zooms on the text written on the side of guns accompanied with bizarre sound effects make up this gangster film. Snatch. is not set in Newcastle circa 1971 what with its seacoal dispatchers and its chimneys and factories; nor is it post Second World War Brighton with its grimy looking streets covered in terrace housing and racecourses that turn into switchblade death-traps as a superpower struggles to re-build after the war. Snatch. is proud of where it's set and a lot of the grimy locations are accompanied with music that sounds sarcastic, the scene in which Tommy and George approach the Pikey campsite being one. Along with this, it has the audacity to make it all seem very funny.<br/><br/>Two such examples where Ritchie suspends all reality in this film occur when an American diamond dealer is on the phone to the man that stole it, who is at a tailors - he is seen in several different outfits in very quick succession which is obviously impossible. The second example of which manipulates time in an equally carefree manner happens when Turkish explains hare coursing to Tommy  their conversation takes place over a series of cuts spanning three locations that I can only assume would've taken a fair amount of time to cover; it begs the question what they spoke about during the in-between cuts. The conversation starts at the campsite, covers the car journey and ends in a muddy field somewhere as Turkish explains something in very little time.<br/><br/>But Snatch. will remain one of my favourite films; a sort of escapist gangster film that ties in elements of the gangster-heavy thanks to Brick Top's character but keeps the mood relatively light with characters you're not supposed to understand and others whose hapless journey through the underworld will see them in body bags; holding up a bounty hunter in a pub letting off extra loud blanks in moving vehicles. It's fast, it's abruptly named, it's quotable and it's one of my favourite films ever made."

","If you liked ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", you will love ""Snatch"". ""Lock..."" is a bit different movie, cause Ritchie introduces us with the way he's making movies and the whole atmosphere of London he wants to present. While ""Lock..."" has more 'domestic' look, ""Snatch"" has more well-known actors (bigger budget) and also a story that doesn't get behind Ritchie's first movie. My personal favorite is ""Snatch"", although I gave maximum grades to both movies.<br/><br/>Ritchie's constellation of characters is simply great. Here, the story follows Turkish (Jason Statham), an unlicensed boxing promoter, and his friend and colleague Tommy (Stephen Graham). They are involved into the world of match fixing by the notorious Brick Top (Alan Ford). Things get complicated when the boxer they had gets beaten by Mickey (Brad Pitt). Tommy is guilty for that, cause he wanted to buy a caravan from the Irish Gypsies (Mickey and his 'family') and things get pretty wrong. Now Turkish and Tommy tries to convince Mickey to fight for them and eventually lose. At the same time, a huge diamond is stolen, so that involves lots of strange characters, like 'Cousin Avi' (Dennis Farina), Boris 'The Blade' (Rade Serbedzija), Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro), Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) and lots more, who all want diamond (on one way or another) for themselves.<br/><br/>We've got bunch of crazy characters, excellent story and brilliant direction that makes this movie interesting and not for a second boring. My favorite character is Boris 'The Blade', played by Serbedzija. Maybe I'm not very objective, cause I'm Croatian just like Rade but he really had amazing character and he acted perfectly. But the best performance comes from Brad Pitt. He is memorable as Mickey and this is definitely one his best roles in career. Of course I bow to everyone else, especially Ford (brilliant), Statham, Jones, Farina, Del Toro and those three 'bookie robbers': Robbie Gee, Lennie James and Ade. They afford me laugh that is hard to forget. Thank you all. All that I can say is that I want more, more of this sort of characters and more of this kind of bizarre situations. And of course more of Ritchie's humor that blown me off the first time; and now once again."

The off-voice also becomes really unpleasant as we're no teens and we like to think sometimes. Now the pros, the better acting here is clearly delivered by Brick Top (Alan Ford a TV actor semi-unknown) he is funny and terrifying at one time. The second best is delivered by Vinnie Jones, a one-face tough boy actor but why should he change if he is good at it?. The intricate and rather ridiculous plot is based on coincidence (Ritchie is London that small?)but keeps you focused on the film, the problem is that when you finish there's not much to remember. Obscene high rate on IMDb."
"crawhitham","6","0","1","3 December 2006"," Looking to be entertained-- and nothing else?
","Neither Guy Ritchie or anybody has outdone themselves with this film. It's mediocre enough and exaggeratedly mainstream, but then again there's no shame in earning the day's due pocket cash is there? Although the film quite obviously disguises some clumsy acting with a varying of delightful accents that doubtlessly pull in the non-British/-Irish audience, the overall production does marvelously for what it's meant to be: pure entertainment. It's very funny, very light, with a kick-ass soundtrack and accomplishes the ever-loved concept of turning hateful realities of violence and butchery into buffoonery.<br/><br/>It's a fantastic popcorn-beer-and-joint movie. Watch it!"
"Chicky5150","10","0","1","3 October 2006"," Classic film
","I am an admitted Anglophile, but this film is simply stunning. Ritchie channels the spirit of Damon Runyon, refines the plot twists from the confusing Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and makes a fantastic film.<br/><br/>I won't even describe the plot because I wouldn't dare ruin the surprises. Suffice to say various elements of the criminal underworld are after a large diamond. The characters are unforgettable, no one seems to be acting, they are simply existing, and Alan Ford's low level gangster 'Brick Top Polford' is the single greatest character I've seen in any film in the last couple of years.<br/><br/>Better than Pulp Fiction."

","Released on the heels of his stylishly dangerous ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,"" ""Snatch"" simultaneously solidified the grit-edged, flamethrower directorial style of Guy Ritchie, even as it launched Jason Statham into his ""Transporter"" leading man roles; heralded an altogether explosive performance from Alan Ford as Brick Top; proved yet again the go-to value of Rade Sherbedgia as generic Slovakian Hard Guy (even though no two publications can agree on the spelling of his name); saw Dennis Farina reprising his smarm-jockey from ""Get Shorty""; was a hilarious continuation of Vinnie Jones' unbalanced contract killer from ""Lock, Stock,"" and marked Bradley Pitt's first foray into incoherent mumbling whilst covered in tattoos and poo.<br/><br/>With a soundtrack as impertinent as its plot and as foreboding as the felons who populate it, edited with a verve which could snap your cervical vertebrae and shot with a style that will make your eyebrows bleed, ""Snatch"" is a Molotov cocktail of a movie; a careening, chain-wielding maniac of a film.<br/><br/>It's about incompetent thugs and incomprehensible gypsies. It's about Desert Eagle point five-oh's and fist-sized, dog-swallowed diamonds. It's about bare-knuckle street fighting, for gangsters who breed people-eating pigs. No good guys and no bad guys - only bad guys and badder guys.<br/><br/>Indescribable at best, inexplicable at worst, who knows exactly what is going on in ""Snatch,"" except maybe Guy Ritchie - and only when he's drunk.<br/><br/>Compulsive gambler, Frankie Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) must deliver from London to New York an 86-carat diamond to Cousin Avi (Farina), but Boris the Blade (Sherbedgia) gets in the way, via his small-time help, Vincent and Sol, simultaneously igniting the wrath of sadistic underworld kingpin, Brick Top (who would just as readily suffocate you with a plastic bag or feed you to a pig as deign to scathe your manhood with his cockney insults). So Cousin Avi must jump-cut travel to England and employ Bullet Tooth Tony (Jones) to retrieve the gem.<br/><br/>Disparate plots and subplots intertwine like choker vines - with dialog so lushly British you could smell the fish 'n' chips and comedy so sharp you could paper-cut your tongue on it.<br/><br/>In a seemingly removed throughline, Turkish (Statham) and his marginally-tolerated sidekick, Tommy (Stephen Graham) get themselves deep into devil dealings over bare-knuckle boxing matches with Brick Top and must tactfully employ the very fighter who put their star fighter out of commission - the ""harder than a coffin nail"" gypsy, Mickey (Pitt). Refusing to play the game of taking dives, Mickey gets Turkish and Tommy into even deeper devilry when his freight-train right hook fells Brick Top's bet-winning boxer.<br/><br/>Freeze frames, crash-cuts, slomo, chronological reversal, whip zooms, contrast-treated frames, follow-frames, Batman angles - Ritchie relishes throwing the baby and the bathwater at the viewer, garnering his fair share of stylistic detractors. Ultimately, ""Snatch"" is not designed for ""The Wedding Planner"" set.<br/><br/>In the final few minutes, the disparate threads coalesce and the diamonds and dogs and boxers and blaggings all somehow crazily make sense.<br/><br/>But only when you're drunk.<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)"

","What could possibly be said about this film that would hold some relevance? It is brilliant, that is certain. It is fun, that is also true. Most importantly, it is edgy. Snatch is the story of an unlicensed boxing manager (portrayed superbly by Jason Statham) and his footpad, a gypsy bare-knuckle boxer (probably Brad Pitt's most entertaining role since Interview With the Vampire-- or maybe Seven), a ruthless hired gun (Vinnie Jones in his most entertaining role), a stubborn and unkillable ex-KGB officer (Rade Sherbedgia) and a whole bevy of other equally unique and entertaining characters.<br/><br/>The movie features several of my favourite actors: Benicio Del Torro (though his role was short-lived); Jason Statham (again, superb); Vinnie Jones (one of the finest supporting actors); and Dennis Farina (who seems to play a similar role in all his films-- though this was by far the best take on it).<br/><br/>The story is racy, following a web woven through the theory of Six Degrees of Separation-- every major player can be linked easily to several of the others.<br/><br/>It is centralized around a diamond (and a rather massive one, at that), and the gem's path from hand to hand. It seems that each character who lays hands on the diamond finds chaos follows it very shortly thereafter, often to a comedic end.<br/><br/>But, the rest shall be left for the viewer to discover.<br/><br/>10/10."

","Guy Ritchie's done it again! As was ""Lock, Stock..."", ""Snatch"" is everything you could possibly want in a British Comedy and more. With it's quick-witted one liners and its hilarious plot it really brings out the best in the likes of Jason Statham and Vinnie Jones. But the best performance of the whole movie has to go to Brad Pitt for his portrayal of Mickey O'Neil, the hard-drinking, bare-knuckle boxer who could knock out even the largest of fellas with one deadly punch. Pitt proves that he isn't just a pretty boy of Hollywood and that he can vary his performances in accordance to the film that he is starring in. Take for example his performance as O'Neil in ""Snatch"" to his performance as Achilles in ""Troy"". OK ""Troy"" may not be the greatest of films but there is a big, big difference in characters. ""Snatch"" is the perfect lads movie. Guns, money, bookmakers, boxing, stolen diamonds, robbers, gangsters and to top it all of...it's a comedy and it's British! With its snappy dialogue and side-splittingly funny, villainous Londoners I highly recommend this movie!<br/><br/>My Rating : A Brilliant 9/10"

","Snatch is a Top Shelf movie. If you're a fan of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, then this movie is for you. Its got V.O.C. (Variety, Originality and Creativity). It dominates within its genre and takes pages from others. The characters have great depth in personality and are easy to fall for. The story is original, but for this day and age, the shock value lacks a bit, but is made up for through its original comedy, action, random dialog (including pi key language) and the twisty plot. SNATCH IS my favorite movie, you can tell by my email address. On a side note, this movie is one I can say none of my friends would ever enjoy if watching it with me.

","I really enjoyed this one. Dennis Farina and Brad Pitt along with Alan Ford, Vinnie Jones, and Jason Stratham tear you a new one. A very large diamond is stolen from a bunch of Jewish jewelers in London by a group of Mafia gangsters and changes hands many, many, many times while at the same time two racketeers try and make peace with a boxing promoter/crime boss. It's witty, clever, and throughly enjoyable. I liked the way it flowed from story to story and Pitt is amusing as the fast talking kick your ass Gypsy. Dennis Farina is terrific and the scene with his brother thinking he is a Jew when he is of course Italian is hilarious. Alan Ford is the standout here giving a excellent speech about feeding his enemies to pigs. There is a little bit of action and shooting to offset the comedy which prevails throughout the entire picture. The acting is well done and fits nicely with the plot. Guy Ritchie has shown us that he has some good material up his sleeve and I hope to see a lot more."

","Snatch is a gangster tale, set in England. While it's nothing like these films, the best comparisons I can make are ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Way of the Gun"". All the actors do a spectacular job, especially Brad Pitt who plays Mickey the Piker. His ability to play a marble-mouthed boxer is impressive, comparable to any of his other solid roles. The camera work is brilliant, with guns directing the direction of angles. Boris the Blade is one of the greatest mob characters ever invented. But best of all is the intricacy of the script. Rather than a straight ""rise to the top"" gangster movie like Scarface, this one requires multiple viewings to really understand. Multiple gangsters with various affiliations going after different objectives. Yet they're all interconnected, and trying to keep straight in your mind who works for whom might just take a little work. This film is highly recommended, and even more so if you're already a fan of the other films mentioned."

","Guy Ritchie yet again delivers a fast-pace, dynamic combination of story, visuals and soundtrack, making sure that there isn't a dull moment for the audience to drift off on.<br/><br/>the story is centred around a diamond, naturally all the characters want in on its wealth so the plot thickens, a race between characters to the valuable prize.<br/><br/>of course the obvious question is, how does it compare to the famous lock, stock and two smoking barrels? Guy Ritchie clearly left a signature on his first film, fortunately this is carried on to snatch and could be developed even further to create more exciting sequences and more compelling scenes than ever before.

"ShootingShark","7","0","1","21 August 2005"," Terrific Wacky Heist Movie As Cockney Geezers Scramble For Stolen Diamond
","A huge diamond is stolen in a heist in Antwerp and taken to London, but winds up in the hands of three petty crooks, who fall foul of a local gangster. Meanwhile, a street-boxing promoter hires an unlikely gypsy to take a dive in a match organised by said gangster. When he wins instead, things turn nasty. Also involved are a dodgy diamond merchant, his American cousin, a Russian gun-runner and a manhunter. Much confusion ensues.<br/><br/>Writer-director Ritchie's second movie is a terrific gangster farce, a violent Cockney version of The Pink Panther, as the jewel passes back and forward between various unwitting characters with great names like Franky Four Fingers, Doug The Head and Bullet Tooth Tony. The wonderful script weaves together two separate story lines and a dozen different main characters so swiftly it leaves you gasping. The cast are fantastic, if only for their sheer variety; Statham is wonderful as the milk-drinking, much put-upon Turkish, and plays the whole movie with one amusing expression of slightly confused irritation. Ford, as arch-villain Bricktop, complete with yellow teeth and Health Service glasses, is a stunningly evil geezer, whose speech on the practicalities of feeding dead bodies to pigs is one of the film's highlights. Pitt is memorable in a flashy part as the incomprehensible bare-knuckle boxer (""D'ya loike dags ?""), and Graham, Farina, Jones and Reid all lend great support. Filled with eye-popping moments and lots of snazzy dialogue (""Who took the jam out of your doughnut ?""), this a terrific, hilarious, supercool crime caper filled with an irresistible gallery of lowlifes. Never bet against a gypsy."

","I am a graduate of the director admirers theory in life. You like a few films the director does and you should find something redeeming in most of their works. I cannot even say I will watch a film for the actors alone. Like when I watched this film, I was more interested in the director than Brad Pitt being in it and I count myself as a Pitt fan (Seven, Fight Club, the first Ocean's Eleven). I wanted to see what this director could do (I had never seen his work), I had heard from my male friends that it was great but I form my opinions myself. <br/><br/>It was to be a surprise and it turned out that it wasn't in the video collection so they went out and bought a copy at the local video store. Yes, Virginia, it is that good if you don't have a copy to show, you go out and buy another. So we settled in to watch the mystery movie. <br/><br/>I have to say that through out the whole thing, it wasn't the story that got me so much as the angles. The cinematography was AWESOME. There were scenes that you would NEVER see regular directors trying. It was so beautiful. The story, let me get back to that, was fast-paced and frenetic. It was cunning and articulate. <br/><br/>In the end, or near to it (I hope y'all know what moment I mean) I clapped!! I cared for the characters in a way that hasn't capture my emotions for a long time, maybe that is just the girl in me talking though.... <br/><br/>Its a good solid energetic film with the best cinematography I have seen in so many years. I highly recommend it and if you can't get your girlfriend to watch it--mention the scene with Pitt in his underwear and she should watch it readily!! (I had no such warning--whoo!)"

Everything is smart and cool, nothing feels unnecessary. Every actor plays well, especially Benicio Del Toro (oh he is so GOOD!!), it is so tragic that a character like Frankie ""Four-fingers"" dies so early. But I would not have it any other way, because, then it would not be Snatch. Guy Richie is a genius, oh, I love Lock, Stock.... too, its actually a little better than Snatch. Because it feels just a little more British I guess. My favorite part of the movie is when Sol and Vinnie are going to rub the bookies, I laugh so it hurts every time. Coolest character, absolutely Frankie, second Boris and third Turkish, yeah I now, Bullet-tooth Tony is so awesome that I can't believe it, but Turkish with his ironic comments and funny one-liners like: Four seats and a steering-wheel. This movie is awesome. If you haven't seen it, SEE IT!!! If you have seen it and don't own it, BUY IT, and watch it over and over again."

These men count their bread money in thousands of pounds...the real mobsters count them in millions of dollars. The movie it's a beautiful diamond jewel. It's a ""what you don't want to happen, will happen"" movie. That's why Guy Ritchie or Tarantino movies are shocking in a very entertaining manner.<br/><br/>The central reason of the movie is a very big diamond. And where is a diamond there always will be the greed. This is why the action goes crazy and links every character to this diamond.

","An English friend of mine recommended that I see both Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. He guessed my sense of humor right, because I love them both. The viewer needs to possess tolerance for a certain amount of violence, and a black sense of humor helps. It also helps if the viewer has seen a lot of BBC America broadcasts, or has a natural aptitude for interpreting accents, because they're pretty thick in places. Brad Pitt's mumbling is completely unintelligible to me, but my Limey buddy assures me that he used a genuine Irish-gypsy accent. Unless they're aching to see Brad Pitt, I wouldn't think most women would enjoy this film. The ones who do are my kinda gals! This is an enjoyable film...for the right audience."

The editing follows the incredible speed of the movie. Fast cuts, active camera, lots and lots of plans are Ritchie's forte here.<br/><br/>Cinema purists might not like it, but it comes down to what are you researching in cinema.

"popeman89","9","0","1","12 February 2005"," Very entertaining gangster film
","The best thing about Snatch is that it can be enjoyed on so many different levels. The characters are all dirty and mean, as gangsters should be, but you also cant help sympathising with them. Without this, Snatch probably wouldn't have worked as well as it did. Also all the characters have very different personalities which makes it even more fun to watch them interact. The dialogue is fast and often hilarious with memorable lines such as ""I'm driving down the road with your head stuck in my window. What does it look like I'm doing'?"" and ""This is Tommy. He tells people he's named after a gun, but I know he's named after a famous 19th century ballet dancer."" The music in Snatch has a strange Russian style and on its own it doesn't seem like it would work well in a London gangster film but somehow it works very effectively.<br/><br/>The best part of Snatch would have to be the directing, Guy Ritchie manages to switch perspective and time to create a very fast pace which makes Snatch even more fun to watch. He also makes great use of some imaginative camera angles.<br/><br/>Overall, Snatch is a fast paced, extremely entertaining gangster film which is only slightly let down by the plot which takes a while to understand.<br/><br/>9/10"

I think this is one of the best movies i've seen. Big call I know, but I enjoyed it that much! Pitt's characher was amazing (Pikey) in that I really was struggling to understand him! & that punch of his ... OMG!

","excellent film but not near as good as Mr. Ritchie's tour de force. I refer to his re-make of 'Swept-Away'. Who knew the director could sing and direct? Like a pro ball player in two sports! Go figure. I mean, lock stock was good, he got me interested, got me thinking there was more to this guy than crooning blue heads in las Vegas. Along comes Snatch avec proof he's no flash in the pan but with SA he seals the deal. Swept II - all too late in the coming arriving not a moment too soon. & the casting, Madonna!!!!! How did he ever get her? I guess she needed the work.

"dudelebowskii","8","0","1","5 December 2004"," Lock, Stock... is a classic. Snatch certainly is not.
","Lock, Stock was an instant classic. It was so refreshingly clever in it's style, dialogue, characters and narrative. It was such a fun watch, the film was the very definition of cool. It oozed energy and ideas, and Guy Ritchie worked the humour into the film through the dialogue and the variety of fantastic characters absolutely perfectly.<br/><br/>I do not usually encourage comparisons with a director's previous good work. It makes it far too easy to criticise. But Ritchie leaves one no choice with Snatch. It conveys too much cockiness, it shows too much awareness of his Lock, Stock success. Ritchie is showing off about his talents that brought the deserved recognition and success of his first work and it comes across as just big-headed. <br/><br/>This is disappointing because Snatch also has many very good ideas but they are not realized anywhere near as well as in Lock, Stock. It is a pity. The two central reasons for Lock, Stock working so well was the characters and the script. The characters were marvelous creations and made great use of the crackling dialogue. Snatch does have a couple of great characters (notably Brad Pitt's humorous Pikey and Dennis Farina's wonderful Cousin Avi) but there are two many characters that lack character or are just very annoying. Brick Top made me grind my teeth every time he spoke, which was not the case with the powerful gangster type in Lock, Stock. The script in Snatch is at times on a par with Lock, Stock, but then the cockiness comes through, and it gets ridculous. Vinnie Jones' character seems to be the main culprit (this is not Vinnie's fault, it's just what he got pitted with).<br/><br/>It appears to me that Ritchie was so desperate to give Snatch its own identity separate from Lock, Stock (by trying to be more clever and more funny) that it just comes across as a more far-fetched and less genuine accompaniment. It even includes a moment deliberately there to get the audience remembering their enjoyment of Lock, Stock (Vinnie Jones slamming someones head in a car door). This inclusion is a perfect demonstration of Snatch not being able to become its own film, it needs the audience to acknowledge the better previous film to generate positive emotions when watching this one. <br/><br/>This film is at its best when watching it with your mates and after a few beers, the moments of less than subtle humour becomes almost acceptable then, and the soundtrack is once again superb. Like I said it is a pity, because Snatch could have been so much more. It has many very good moments, but there are others that just aren't effective because they're too ridiculous or said by characters that are not very substantial. Enjoyable yet frustrating. The film is nothing more than that."

"rbverhoef","8","0","1","13 September 2004"," Not as good as 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'
","'Snatch' has a very entertaining beginning and a very entertaining end. It is too bad that the middle part plays slows, is less funny and more predictable. After Guy Ritchie's 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', an exercise in style with a funny crime story, I was expecting a lot. In a way 'Snatch' delivers. Again we have an excellent exercise in style and the crime story is pretty funny. But when you really think about it we have the same again. The reason that the middle part from 'Snatch' is not that good is probably because we have seen it in a movie too close to this one. Fortunately the end takes the movie to a higher level again.<br/><br/>We start with Turkish (Jason Statham), who is also the narrator, and Tommy (Stephen Graham). Turkish explains us that he does not know much about diamonds and then the movie is a big flashback. We see how Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) and three partners steal a big diamond in Antwerp and how a lot of people want that diamond. We also see how Turkish and Tommy arrange some illegal boxing matches with a guy named Brick Top (Alan Ford). Brick Top delivers one fighter, Turkish and Tommy the other named Gorgeous George (Adam Fogerty). Unfortunately Gorgeous George is wounded when Tommy and George try to buy a caravan from gypsies, including Mickey (Brad Pitt). These are two beginnings of separate stories that will come together near the end.<br/><br/>How that happens is something you should see for yourself but it involves Mickey who will be the replacement of Gorgeous George but fails doing what he should do. It also involves Doug the Head (Mike Reid) who knows how to sell stolen diamonds, Avi (Dennis Farina) who is interested in the diamond as is Boris the Blade (Rade Serbedzija). We also meet Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) who helps Avi to get back the diamond. There are more characters but it would make it more confusing if I would mention them.<br/><br/>The story, although it is too much like 'Barrels', is still one of the pleasures here. A lot of characters are introduced and for some reason Ritchie is able to make you understand who knows who and why. Reading the connections it is hard to remember them but when it is visualized by a gifted director you will remember. It is a good thing that not everything comes together because that is the way it should be; coincidence has a big part, like we saw in 'Pulp Fiction'.<br/><br/>I mention 'Pulp Fiction' because there are other connections. The movie is told not chronological but with constant flashbacks and flash-forwards and there is a moment where you can say: 'This is where we came in.' Like in 'Pulp Fiction' the pieces fall into place after the scenes, during them we are still guessing a bit. Another connection is the dialogue. Not that the speaking style is really the same, but here the dialogue is almost as important as it was in 'Pulp Fiction'. Because it is clearly different from the 'Pulp'-language you can admire it on its own level.<br/><br/>For style, visual and in dialogue, for some nice black British humor, for very interesting storytelling, see 'Snatch' but start with 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'."

","My favorite thing about this film was the characters, it was almost like a comic book because of so many unique characters. the acting is good, some performances better than others. I do feel that the movie wouldn't of done that great at all without Brad Pit, i feel that its his greatest performance, that accent is terrific. The end of the movie was good but kind of unoriginal in my opinion.<br/><br/>I think That Guy Ritchie has talent and this film shows it, but sometimes he bombs terribly. He shows his talent with the many different camera angles that happen in rapid succession. I think people will like this film because of Turkish, he is extremely clever and reliable, people want to be his character. Overall the film was enjoyable, i do recommend it."

","Come on, guys, if a film offers bare-knuckle boxing, high-scale larceny and low-brow laughs (plus a pivotal scene in a topless bar), what's not to like? ""Snatch"" is classic Ritchie, from the scheming gangsters who are too smart for their own good, to the hapless low-lifes who clearly AREN'T too smart for their own good.  Did somebody say ""derivative?""  Have some more popcorn, chief, we're trying to watch a movie here!<br/><br/>""Snatch"" is the story of two amiable London low-lifes (Stratham and Graham) trying to make an honest living promoting illegal boxing.  When they go to buy a new office trailer from a band of gypsies (led by Brad Pitt), they find themselves drawn into a violent and sardonically humorous turf war revolving around a stolen diamond that keeps getting stolen.  Stratham and Graham are perfect as two smart guys who can't manage to do a single smart thing, and Brad Pitt is masterly as an inscrutable (and unintelligible) British Gypsie.  Suffice it to say that fists and firearms are central to the conduct of the movie, and Ritchie leaves no blood unspilled.<br/><br/>
Ritchie populates his movie with a gaggle of very original secondary characters chasing the stolen diamond.  They've all let their greed get the better of themselves--and they realize it.  The result is a lively running banter of insults interspersed with trademark Ritchie sight gags.  Just as in ""Lock Stock..."" you can expect a multi-threaded plot-line--Ritchie seems honor-bound to make his viewers run to keep up.  No matter, in the end everyone is given at least one chance to shoot, stab or steal from everyone else in the movie, so if you've lost track of who's doing what to whom. ..they all are!<br/><br/>Yes, many aspects of ""Snatch"" will be familiar to viewers of ""Lock Stock..."" Somehow this is construed as a negative by people who maybe ought to lighten up a little.  For the rest of us who enjoyed ""Lock Stock..."", ""Snatch"" is Ritchey at the height of his powers, giving everyone and everything a swat with a bloody whoopie cushion."

","An over-written and preposterous script is somewhat saved by some good performances (particularly Brad Pitt as the gypsy boxer) and the occasional funny line (unfortunately there are far more lead balloons than knee-slappers.)<br/><br/>Zany madcap British comedy paired with grim and gratuitous violence makes for a pretty muddy mixture and the gimmicky editing becomes annoying after about five minutes.  That said, the movie is somewhat enjoyable at times and the unexpected (for me at least) twist at the end somewhat satisfying.<br/><br/>I think it would have been a better movie if they cut every scene involving the diamond and focused entirely on the boxing storyline.  Despite the attempts to join the two plots through common characters,  they come off as two different movies competing for the viewers' interest (with the boxing scam easily beating out the silly diamond hijinks.)<br/><br/>The tone is self-congratulatory and you get a sense that the principals involved truly believe they are making a film of landmark importance. Call me crazy, but A British imitation of ""Pulp Fiction"" seems a pretty small blip on the radar screen of cinematic history.  Pardon me mates, but I think you better find another savior for your film industry.  I mean, the follow-up to this was the universally reviled ""Swept Away.""

It's not Oscar-worthy stuff, but it is fun.<br/><br/>A word about Brad Pitt's accent in the film.  Many have called it the worst Irish accent they've ever heard.  This would be an insult to Pitt's craft but for the fact that it's plainly explained in the film that he's not Irish.  He's a ""gypo"", or gypsy.

","If you liked 'Lock, Stock, and 2 Smoking Barrels' then Snatch is probably up your alley.  Be warned, if you can't tolerate or understand British accents (specifically Cockney, I think) then don't bother!!!  This is full of plot twists, extremely colorful characters and you've got to have a unique sense of humor to enjoy it.  I'm not a big Brad Pitt fan, but he was actually pretty good as the unintelligible gypsy boxer.  I'm a big Benicio del Toro fan and he's got a minor role as the gambling-addicted Frankie Four Fingers. I love movie quotes but, unfortunately, most of the best from this movie aren't suitable.

","Snatch Review In 1998 Guy Ritchie released his amusing view of the British Underworld called Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  Now he's gone one step further with Snatch, which was one of the funniest movies I saw in 2000.  With an all-star cast this movie will have you laughing until you cry.  It is black comedy at it's very best. Starting in Antwerp, a man by the name of Frankie Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) holds up a diamond dealer and gets his hands, or all nine fingers if you will, on very large diamonds.  He then takes those diamonds to London and arranges a meeting with Doug the Head (Mike Reid), a Jewish diamond dealer. Meanwhile Franky wants a gun, so he goes to Boris (Rade Serbedzija).  In exchange for the gun, Boris sends Franky to the bookies to put money on an illegal boxing match.  This is a set up as the bookies are to be robbed by two pathetic, black porn brokers.  The plot now becomes very complex as the local crime boss Brick Top (Alan Ford) has been promised by the promoters Turkish (Jason Statham) and Tommy (Stephan Graham) that they will put up a fighter.  The contestant, unfortunately, is hospitalised by a bare-knuckle gypsy-boxing champion.  Meanwhile, the largest diamond is lost and everybody wants to find it including an American diamond dealer.  Sound simple enough? Describing this complicated plot is not easy because it is so intertwined. In addition, I don't want to give away the very amusing scenarios. The experienced and talented cast includes Jason Statham (The Transporter) as the sarcastic fight organiser called Turkish.  Alan Ford is the notorious crime boss, Brick Top and Brad Pitt (Fight Club) as Mickey O'Neil, the bare-knuckle boxing champion.  Vinnie Jones (Mean Machine) plays hard man Bullet Tooth Tony and Benicio Del Toro, who later wins an Oscar for Traffic, is Franky Four Fingers, a man with a gambling problem.  Dennis Farina (Get Shorty) is the impatient American diamond dealer Cousin Abraham 'Avi' Denovitz.  Rade Serbedzija (The Quiet American) as the 'hard to kill' ex KGB Boris The Blade/Bulletdodger.  Jason Flemyng (The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) as Mickey's best friend Darren.  These actors play their parts so well that you feel that you are part of this underground criminal culture. The nicknames are so descriptive of each of the characters. Directed by Guy Ritchie, this film seems like a sequel to Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  The style and feeling is almost exactly the same. The way in which he weaves separate stories together as though they are viewed from different angles.  Since he is an English director he uses the typical Cockney slang that's common in the backstreets of London.  The script is very clever in the terms of how much that slang is being used and although one may not be familia with the expressions it can be easily understood from the context. The opening sequence is ingenious.  It moves from one person to another showing us who they are and what they do.  It also shows us how all of these people are connected and sets the scene for the interesting plot that follows. As much as I loved Guy's first instalment this is by far the funnier of the two.  Not only are the characters famous internationally but also they each play their parts to perfection reflecting their characters.  The result is incredibly funny and well mixed. Rating:  5/5 Stars"

Parts such as Alan Ford's explanation of nemesis. Del Toro did not play much in this film, had barely anything to say. Graham and statham shined as Tommy and Turkish, two boxing promoters. Brad Pitt was great as a grundgy Gypsy. Farina, Ford, Jones and Reid added great dialogues. I really liked this film a definete recommendation by me.

","Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and Snatch, are almost completely identical films, (except maybe in the lengths of the titles) but they use the same narrative styles, storylines, themes and even characters. Guy has obviously a passion for these fast and energetic films, so don't expect any different from him, the question really is, are they really any good?<br/><br/>The film 'Snatch' is based around a group of London's underground gangsters, criminals and mobs. Three individual storylines meet and part, only to meet again, and then part again, combined with excessively fast cuts and sequences this makes the storyline difficult to digest for the average audience member the first time round. These set of gangsters; however all are in it for the same thing, in some way or another, a diamond which is a big as a small fist. These are also linked to a group of sub-plots which weave into the storylines of the different groups in the movie. Creating a well defined storyline, although this for most of the film will leave the audience slightly disorientated. Of course because of films Black comic nature, half the characters are the same way.<br/><br/>The editing style used in Snatch ranges from incredibly fast cuts and sequences, to slow and long dialogue's between characters, including a long monologue of the 'usefulness' of a pig's digestive system. Just because the film is in English, doesn't mean that we have gotten over the language barrier with international film yet, while the accent is much more understandable there are some characters who it seems even other characters can't even understand, an example being Mickey (Brad Pitt) who speaks in his own dialect only few have mastered. Overall the storyline is complicated to a degree that it makes the film unpredictable yet still understandable (well, maybe on the second viewing)<br/><br/>The script is an interesting component of the movie as it creates some interesting characters, Avi (Dennis Farina), an American business man being only one example. However the storyline seems to cut in and out of storylines, characters and times too quickly, the beginning of the movie seems to introduce the characters too quickly then dumps you into the middle of the story. It takes some time for the audience to catch up with each of the groups within the story and figure out how each are related. By the end of the film the audience has just got to know the characters, and aren't really concerned for them by the time they make their 'exit,' let alone relate to any of them, although this would be an impossible task for any realistic person anyway. The characters are interesting and dynamic, but when it comes down to it not real and believable. However I agree with Roger Ebert in that: `.no movie can be all bad that contains the following dialogue:<br/><br/>U.S. Customs official: 'Anything to declare?' Avi (Dennis Farina): 'Yeah. Don't go to England.' Roger Ebert (See Bibliography)<br/><br/>
Guy Ritchie's 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' follows a similar formula so those who enjoyed 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' will most likely enjoy Snatch. However I feel this film was let down by an undeveloped and erratic plot. Ben Waugh"
"andrew_anning747","Null","0","1","13 March 2003"," One of the best Black Farce films made
","Guy Ritchie's `Snatch', is a hilarious look into the world of a small known `businessman' and his partner, slugging it out with a big-time criminal mastermind who always gets his way.  This compelling new age flick, has all the right ingredients to what makes a great, black farce film, which is exactly what it is.<br/><br/> The story starts with the robbery of an eighty-six carat diamond.  This leads to the introduction of some of Britain's underground gangsters.  The hunt for the diamond is on, with a little illegal boxing, gambling and a bunch of Pikeys (Gypsies) on the side.  As you watch the multi-plot structures, and the movies black humour combine, you will be truly fascinating by the way the characters handle such occurrences.<br/><br/> Unlike one of Ritchie's famous movie ` Lock, Stock and two smoking barrels,' Snatch's editing changes from character to character, updating the sub-narrative threads that take place.  The frantic paced camerawork enables the audience to feel enthralled in the movies twists and turns.<br/><br/> A range of characters in the movie intersect theirs paths with others. This leads to the sub-narrative threads being linked together into a firm ball of fun and laughter.  Through the inclusion of devices such as split screens and a '1980's British Pop' sounding soundtrack, Ritchie has managed to incorporated sequences including decades of cinematic style and cultural differences.<br/><br/> Although it is hard to pin point a particular character to take the part of the main, from an observer's point of view it would be Turkish (Jason Statham) and his side kick Tommy (Stephen Graham).  Some of the best scenes in the movie are  between the strained relationship of Turkish and Tommy as they try to avoid becoming a meal for the pigs. At the same time, Turkish is trying to control the unpredictable Pickey, Mickey (Brad Pitt) to do as he is told.  As the story unravels, it takes twists and turn that prove to be lethal and leave you praying that you are never faced with a similar situation.<br/><br/> Throughout the movie, there is a large array of characters with some of Hollywood's most famous faces such as Brad Pitt and Denis Farina, and some not so famous faces, Jason Statham behind them. There are also many outstanding performances from other cast members such as Mike Reid as Doug and Robbie Gee as Vinny.  However, in general, you would not find a movie with a better overall performance.<br/><br/> Ritchie's endless energy in this film makes `Snatch' a must see.  One hundred and three minutes of twists and turns that will leave you wanting to watch it repeatedly, incase you missed any of the minor details.  A movie that has made its mark for incredible acting, and insightful directing.<br/><br/> 9/10"

Throughout the film, the viewer is given the eyes of several of the characters, by use of the camera, which was quite enjoyable.  The use of different angles really emphasized the emotion and tasteful action of each scene as well as evoked a sense of interaction with the viewer.  The line between what's reality and what isn't becomes really thin when the viewer becomes engaged as such. One thing, though, the accents were hard to follow, so for me, watching the film was a bit of work, but well worth it in lieu of the art of it."

Yes - including the one where a gangster gets his head caught in a rising security gate!)<br/><br/>Best of the ensemble cast is Bricktop (Alan Ford) the head gangster and fight fixer who over-articulates and explains everything to the rest of the cast: His explanation of how to dispose of bodies by way of pigs and how best to chop up bodies (""you need to chop them in to six pieces and gather the parts together in one place..."") are a revelation.<br/><br/>(Strangely he reminded me of a  character from a Noel Coward play. He manages to make even the most bland lines such as ""you are not much use to me alive are you, Turkish?"" and ""hope I haven't come at an inconvenient moment"" funny.) <br/><br/>Congratulations to Brad Pitt for playing a gypsy fighter that no one can understand (not even in the movie itself!) A real piece of casting inspiration. <br/><br/>We are deep, deep in black comedy land here and only by keeping it ticking over at a fast (almost pop video) pace can you get away with it. There is no real parts for women and no sex. The characters are far too interest in making a big score or staying alive for all that.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt plays a fighter that - if he was as good as he is here - would surely be boxing for real rather than in the bare-knuckle world; but what the hell, this is a film comedy. The fight scenes are well done by the way - although seem a lot like those that featured in BP's other black comedy Fight Club.<br/><br/>Snatch has must-see appeal to those with strong stomachs that cannot get enough of Pulp Fiction/Goodfellers smart-ass dialogue. Well done Mr Madonna - let us hope that the next feature is just as good. Then you will have made three great films to Tarantino's two."

The only real difference is SNATCH has one eye on the American market with the casting of Benicio Del Toro , Dennis Farina and more importantly Brad Pitt. I can`t help noticing SNATCH has made a bigger impact on the American reviewers than LSATSB. Perhaps it`s more to do with the fact they saw SNATCH first rather than the American cast ? <br/><br/>I had high hopes for Ritchie after seeing LSATSB but there`s rumours his next film SWEPT AWAY will be released straight to video and there`s also rumours Ritchie`s next project will be another gangster film .

","In spite of appropriating both the essence and part of the story of `The Watch' section of `Pulp Fiction', this is a pleasant, though violent, diversion, fast-paced and filled with a large ensemble of memorable characters with lots of juicy lines to say. The writer/director, Guy Ritchie, doesn't seem interested in much more than showing what he's learned from watching Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese and providing a rip-roaring good time; the actors seem to be having fun as well. It's a crime comedy about a large diamond that gets passed around the underworld boxing scene in London and although the dialogue is mostly delivered with thick Cockney accents, the injection of a sizable Hollywood contingent (including Benicio Del Toro, Dennis Farina and, as a gypsy with unintelligible diction, Brad Pitt) as well as the directorial influence gives the film a decidedly American feel. No great shakes but not a bad way to spend a couple of hours either."

","I wasn't expecting too much from this movie.  Based on the previews it looked like a goofy movie about an English bloke who goes about fighting in a seedy underground circuit.  I should start paying attention to the previews I guess because this is a very fun crime caper flick.  I don't want to confuse anyone by trying to explain the sometimes complicated plot but it starts out with a couple of boxing promoters who somehow get mixed up with some fellas who pulled off a diamond heist.  From there it goes in several directions, all of which are alternately action packed and amusing.  Once again we have a movie in a similar vein as Pulp Fiction, but a little less violent and a wee bit more light hearted.  I really got into the characters. They were very unique and comical. Without the well-written characters this movie would have been blasé.  So what we have is a crazy plot and some neat chaps to bring you along with them and we get a very good movie.  Almost forgot..... ehts fu'en bloo'ee 'ard to fu'en u'unstan' wha' the bloo'eh 'ell 'ehr sayin'.

"phagen81","Null","0","1","7 August 2002"," A Highly Entertaining Film
","Snatch, written and directed by Guy Ritchie is an unusual yet highly amusing and entertaining British film. It is a story full of twists and turns about an 86-karat diamond and how an assortment of very different criminals get pulled together and played off against one another as they try to get their hands on it. The film has several subplots but the strands of the story are expertly woven together into an exciting climax.<br/><br/>The editing is superb and has a very similar style as Guy Ritchie's previous film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. The film uses unusual camera angles and strange shots and unconventional lighting to give the viewer insight into the emotions of the character at that particular time. Snatch has a similar gritty, bleached-out colour as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels had, but Snatch definitely has more to offer in the way of special effects and slow-motion scenes. The slow-motion in various action scenes adds a great deal to the film by wrenching the audiences out of fast action and making them hold their breath and think until the slow-motion clip ends. This adds greatly to the suspense of the film. Every cinema going person will notice the effect the slow-motion has on them as they see the rabbit hunting and finale scenes. The film's music adds greatly to its entertainment value and along with unconventional camera angles and superb acting the music makes scenes such as the knockout of Gorgeous George highly amusing.<br/><br/>Snatch has a Pulp Fiction style in the way the story jumps from the past to the future and then back to the past again to explain an event that had just happened. This jumping around keeps the audience on its toes and is easy enough to understand, but a word of warning though: if you miss a minute or two you may find it very difficult to understand what's going on in the film.<br/><br/>The character development of this film is masterful, the larger than life characters are interesting, amusing and very well played by the talented cast. The dialogue is intelligent and funny in a dry British sort of way. The film contains many superb performances from impressive actors such as Vinnie Jones as 'Bullet Tooth Tony', Brad Pitt as the incomprehensible gypsy 'Mickey O'Neil', Jason Statham who both narrates much of the film and plays the character 'Turkish' proves he is an excellent actor, Alan Ford as the detestable 'Brick Top Polford', and Rade Serbedzija who plays the amusing 'Boris the Blade'. Other actors include Benicio Del Toro and Dennis Farina who also put in good efforts.<br/><br/>This film is not perfect though. Some people would attribute this films success to its flashiness, and this is true to a point, but without this flashiness the film would definitely be bland and maybe too much like any Hollywood offering. Some people complain that the film 'borrows' many elements of its plot and style from Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. This is true, but in my opinion this hardly detracts much from the film as a whole.<br/><br/>Overall despite some minor flaws this film is well made, entertaining and most definately worth seeing. If you keep an open mind when watching this film and don't take it too seriously you will almost certainly enjoy it. I give it 8 out of 10."
"scythe101","Null","0","1","6 August 2002"," Funny and original
","The simple concept of underworlders all chasing after a diamond is turned by Ritchie into a brilliant vortex of coincidence, violence and black humour.

","A hugely enjoyable movie, from the opening scene of a 'jewish' Benicio Del Toro snatching the stone in a snappily-filmed armed heist, to It's denouement, Guy Richie's tale of a madcap hunt for a stolen diamond, is smart, sassy, in-your-face movie. The script is superb, and the cast make the most of it. Brad Pitt is a revelation an Irish, bareknuckle boxing gypsy, his thick and hilariously unintelligible Irish brogue leaves you wanting more, if you like your comedy sharp, fast, and relentless, then 'Snatch' is a must-see. Great work by Guy Richie, and an excellent follow-up to ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels""."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","0","1","3 August 2002"," If it's not broke, don't fix it.
","It's good to see that Guy Ritchie's next movie is set far from London's criminal underworld, because it's fair to say that he has probably wrung every last drop of entertainment from the (identical) subject matter of his first two features.  In fact, he wrung the flannel dry, because one of the twists in SNATCH (an attempt to sell goods back to the person they were stolen from), is a direct lift from LOCK, STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS; Now, I don't mind this sort of thing going on when an old idea is re-processed, but, as a writer, if you find yourself stealing from your previous work so soon, you don't ask how much is left in the well, you wonder how much was in there in the first place.<br/><br/>SNATCH contains the same frenetic pace and kinetic direction as its predecessor, and a gritty, bleached-out colour, while having much more of a sixties feel (despite the surfeit of 70s/80s music), and containing a lot more quirky (or flashy, depending on your opinion) touches.   Where this movie does improve on LS&TSB, however, is in injecting a potent dose of pathos into the necessary elements of the plot.   It's a shame, then, that a certain sense of self-satisfaction on the part of writer-director Ritchie is evident in the over-elaborate stylisation.<br/><br/>The strands of the story bind together well as the movie approaches its climax (although the conclusion of the black guys' tale is a little lame), and Ritchie coaxes a far better performance from Vinnie Jones than the one he gave in LS&TSB.   Brad Pitt is especially good in a role that he should have stunk in.<br/><br/>I liked this movie a lot, although you might not think so from what I've written.   Maybe that's a testimony to Ritchie's undoubted ability to deliver a well-made and entertaining story that is strong enough to overcome shortcomings that will, hopefully, be addressed as his career progresses."

","Snatch is a film, imported from the U.K., and directed by Guy Ritchie.<br/><br/>The story is about a valuable diamond that has been stolen and is the object of affection by various criminal-types from all over the globe. A Russian, several Americans, and some Brits are trying to get their hands on it, as well as a dog (one of the best performances by a canine in a while). There's also a subplot about a bookie who is trying for a big score in fixed boxing matches; he and his henchmen are trying to get an Irish gypsy who can hit like a hammer to take a dive.<br/><br/>Admittedly, there are some clever scenes, such as the bouts in which the gypsy fighter (Brad Pitt) fights. They are shot similarly to the famous ""Stop-And-Go"" Nike commercial with Michael Jordan, as well as some intriguing surrealism added in. The opening, where the characters are introduced, is also a neat addition. However, I didn't seem to enjoy it as much as I thought I would. It was good, but it seemed to drag on occasion and there wasn't anyone in the movie who was appealing. Still, the acting is very good and Ritchie and Co. bring some life when it comes to the cinematography; I think Ritchie's next film could be something truly special.

"rlivermore","Null","0","1","17 May 2002"," GREAT MOVIE!!!
","I am soooooo tired of the monotonous, moral telling, happy ending movies! That's why this movie is so great.  There's NO love interests or touching moments, and no character in this movie gives a crap about anybody else, but themselves.  To me, this movie is NOT a heavy hitter as some might say, but if you get your panties in a wad over four letter words, comical violence, or bare knuckle fighting, you need to rent ""Meet the Parents"" because ""Snatch"" isn't for you.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is an amazing actor!  His character is definitely my favorite.  I also love the guy who plays 'Turkish', he surprised me with his ability. And the guy who plays 'Bullet Tooth Tony' cracks me up when he breaks into his educated monologue, spewing big words you wouldn't expect out of a scarry looking guy like that.<br/><br/>I also like the fact that this movie doesn't take itself too seriously.  It isn't condemning the life of gypsies, mobsters, petty thieves, hit men, or anyone else; it's basically telling a funny story (without an end).  The background music fits perfectly throughout, and is very entertaining.  The one liners keep this movie rolling till the end.  They may not be LOL funny, but if you've got an open mind, they'll make you chuckle.<br/><br/>It's a light hearted 'Fight Club', and gives Brad Pitt the absolute ability to prove his talent.

","Ritchie doesn't go to any great lengths to bring anything new to his formula.  But then, the formula worked brilliantly, so why should he?  While it could qualify as more of the same, and certain sequences are a little too showy, hyper and loudly stylistic, this is still an impressive piece of work.  It moves at a mighty pace, and is never, ever dull.  What's most impressive is the way it manages to keep track of a massive number of characters.  There's a sequence in the opening that gives us still shots of every character while flashing their name onscreen; it goes on for some time, and you're bound to think you'll never keep everybody straight.  It's a credit to Ritchie's storytelling abilities that it's never a problem.  In fact, he makes it all seem quite simple.  And while many crime films have now borrowed Tarantino's time-warping style, this one does take a new approach to it.  The entire cast does great work, although Pitt is going to take an unfair amount of the praise here in America.  He's hilarious, yes, but so is everyone here; even the dog.  8 out of 10."
"chain67","9","0","1","20 January 2001"," Bullets, Blood, Laughs and Dogs
","As I said in my opening line this movie has a bit of everything, well only one dog actually but its as funny as 50 can be. Guy Ritchie's ""Snatch"" is one of the craziest movies I have seen in my life. Every laugh is genuine, every twist and turn is unexpected and every one of the 20 - 30 characters in the movies has atleast one moment to shine. This movie is very reminiscent of Pulp Fiction in the way that everything happens unexpectedly, a bunch of stories interwind and gruesome violence is actually hilarious.<br/><br/>  To fully figure out the plot to ""Snatch"" it'll take 3 or 4 viewings atleast, but from one I figured this out. Frankie Four Fingers(Benicio Del Toro) steals an 84 Carat diamond the size of a golf ball from Antwerp. He goes to London where his gun dealer Boris the Blade(Rade Serbedzjia) betrays him hiring a pair of pawn brokers(Robbie Gee, Lenny James) and their driver(Ade) to steal it off Franky. When Franky disappears his boss Cousin Avi(Dennis Farina), the one to who the diamond was headed, comes to London and hires thug Bullet Tooth Tony(Vinnie Jones) to find Franky. While Turkish(Jason Stratham) and Tommy(Stephen Graham) are staging an illegal boxing in which their fighter must go down to the fighter selected by notorious gangster Brick Top(Alan Ford) but when Mickey O' Neil(Brad Pitt) knocks Turkish and Tommy's fighter out they have to convince Mickey to fight. He does but instead of taking a dive knocks his opponent out in one punch. Then it gets complicated.<br/><br/>  The acting in ""Snatch"" is top notch with every actor turning in a great performance. Eventhough it's extremely hard to pick a main character in ""Snatch"" I'd have to say Turkish gets the most screentime barely edging out Mickey and Avi. Jason Stratham plays Turkish with ease and makes him a very fun character. The only reason I chose Turkish as the character with the most screentime is because also the narrator and describes all the other characters. But the actor who stands out most is Brad Pitt. He is hilarious as the gypsey boxer who as we later find out is probably the smartest character in the movie. His accent is so thick even the other characters don't know what he's saying.<br/><br/>  Personally I found ""Snatch"" a number of notches better than the extremely overrated ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and as one of the most purely entertaining films I have ever seen. ""Snatch"" is the freshest movie if the year and also one of the funniest. Great Movie. I give it 9/10."
"DannyBoy-17","Null","0","1","20 January 2001"," A great caper without a lead
","I enjoyed the first hour or so of ""Snatch"", Guy Ritchie's new gangster caper, especially any moment with Frankie Four Fingers (Benicio), the unstoppable Boris the Blade (Rade), or the inept trio of robbers with Tyrone, possibly THE worst getaway driver ever.  It was around the point that Brick Top (an incredibly vicious performance) began explaining just how pigs devour human flesh that I found the film a little too vicious, a feeling enhanced by my mother's revulsion in her seat.  Then came Bullet-Tooth Tony bringing just a touch too much carnage, though his repeated and failed attempts to kill Boris are hilarious.  (Somebody give Rade Sherbedgia a film worth his sense of comic timing!) The biggest problem with ""Snatch"" is that it lacks a strong lead.  Pulp Fiction got away with it, because you're ultimately redeemed by Samuel L. Jackson's transformation.  The similar ""Get Shorty"" had John Travolta's cool cat Chili Palmer.  Here, Turkish (Jason Statham) has got just the right tone for narration, but his character is not at all interesting.  I would have much preferred transferring the story over to Sol, Vinny, and Tyrone and their attempts to get out of the mess with Brick Top and Bullet Tooth and dispose of their increasing number of bodies.<br/><br/>    Brad Pitt plays his minor role effectively, obviously having a devilishly good time with his accent.  Benicio del Toro was likewise enjoying himself- ""Chai'm not in Rrrome.  Chai'm in a rrrush.""  It got to be a little too feverish for a story where eventually you didn't like the supposed ""main"" characters.  The video effects and cinematography were brilliant though- I especially liked the Tarantinoesque re-arrangement of the car crashes and Tony's speech to the robbers.  See it with a bunch of friends, but realize it's not for the squeamish- it's a type of bloody fun we haven't seen in a few years. **.5"

Pulp Fiction got away with it, because you're ultimately redeemed by Samuel L. Jackson's transformation.  The similar ""Get Shorty"" had John Travolta's cool cat Chili Palmer.  Here, Turkish (Jason Statham) has got just the right tone for narration, but his character is not at all interesting.  I would have much preferred transferring the story over to Sol, Vinny, and Tyrone and their attempts to get out of the mess with Brick Top and Bullet Tooth and dispose of their increasing number of bodies.<br/><br/>    Brad Pitt plays his minor role effectively, obviously having a devilishly good time with his accent.  Benicio del Toro was likewise enjoying himself- ""Chai'm not in Rrrome.  Chai'm in a rrrush.""  It got to be a little too feverish for a story where eventually you didn't like the supposed ""main"" characters.  The video effects and cinematography were brilliant though- I especially liked the Tarantinoesque re-arrangement of the car crashes and Tony's speech to the robbers.  See it with a bunch of friends, but realize it's not for the squeamish- it's a type of bloody fun we haven't seen in a few years. **.5"

","When is a movie an homage and when is it a derivative rip-off? I couldn't stop thinking about that question last week while watching 'Snatch.' It seems to be two cups of 'Pulp Fiction' with half a cup of 'Fight Club' mixed in a blender (at high speed!) with a sprinkling of Worcestershire sauce, making some of the British accents hard to digest, but the result is tasty. I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, but would I have liked it even more if I hadn't seen those two other films? Probably. Even having seen them I couldn't help making mental comparisons at most key points. The only real 'Fight Club' similarity is Brad Pitt as a rebel loner covered with carnage while a cigarette dangles from the side of his mouth. He plays a tough street boxer who can drop a guy twice his size with one punch. His incomprehensible jargon has to be heard to be believed. The comparisons to 'Pulp Fiction' are many and it is fun to spot them. So I will let you see what you can find as you watch it for yourself.<br/><br/>The story itself is slight, but with all the characters this story juggles it would be harder to follow if there were more plot to deal with. We have a dozen gangsters and a settlement of pikers (squatters, or gypsies, to us Americans) who cross paths over a stolen 86-karat diamond. The bulk of the story is really inconsequential. It is mainly a frame on which to hang the run-ins of a gaggle of bumbling crooks who spout pearls of street wisdom off the cuff whenever they're not killing each other. The film is written and directed by Madonna's new husband, Guy Ritchie, and there is a reference to her music in one line. This is a funny movie that will need attention paid to the characters and the accents. For some it may not be worth all that work. Personally, I will see it again."

","""Snatch"" is almost exactly the same movie as ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". The similarities are so great that it's almost like watching the same film with a different cast. But it's ok, because this one is just as equally funny.<br/><br/>The two leads scheme to get their hands on fat wads of money, but as the plot thickens, they just want to get out of it alive. In ""Lock, Stock..."" there's a bunch of young, witty blokes who want to earn big money but in the end just want to live through it all. There's a criminal leader of a spectacularly brutal kind who just wants everything his way and has underlings that carry out his wishes to the fullest. In ""Lock, Stock..."" too. A couple of smart but completely worthless small-time crooks are put into the plot to add a pivotal but seemingly meaningless (and funny) part in the whole criss-cross of events. That's almost exactly like in ""Lock, Stock..."", with the notable difference that the crooks in the latter are seriously stupid. The plot is advanced by a series of coincidences and strange twists that accelerate into a blur of weird events and finally comes to a halt just when it can't get much more insane. That is also exactly like in ""Lock, Stock..."". And then there's Vinnie Jones, who is not merely exactly like his character in ""Lock, Stock..."", he _is_ that guy, he just has a different name and a bigger gun.<br/><br/>But, like I said, I don't really care. Both movies are very, very funny, and extremely entertaining to watch. It is excellently filmed and cut (or should I say ""mixed""?), and some shots are just breathtaking. The details, like the dog swallowing the squeaky toy or ""the fact that I have 'Desert Eagle point five-oh' written on mine"", are just so insanely funny, it doesn't really matter that Ritchie seems a bit stuck in a loop. Why change a concept that works? But let's hope that he can do something about it to the next time, or it _will_ get repetitive."
"Gandalf-2","Null","0","1","31 December 2000"," BEWARE! - Animal cruelty shown!
","This film contains a scene in which a rabbit is being hunted by dogs. The camera follows its movements and there is a cut shortly before the dogs supposedly get to the hare. Then, in a different shot, we see the rabbit getting away.<br/><br/>Showing animals in jeopardy is not an option to attract viewers nor to shock. The budget for this film has been far to low to create this shot virtually. Also, I think that the rabbit that got away was a different one. Even if it got away, it still was being hunted with a chance of getting killed, so it doesn't really matter what happened after the cut.<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, Mr. Ritchie has overstressed his competences with this. Up to that moment, I enjoyed the film, but from then onward, all of the events were meaningless, boring and not enjoyable at the slightest. Why? Because movie-making is the art of illusion. In this case, I have been shown something that was definitely NOT an illusion, and this event destroyed the band of trust that develops between the viewers and the screen. The director is handed over the viewer's emotions, he then is in charge of leading, forming  and influencing them. There are rules to this game, and Mr. Ritchie has broken them. That is not only irresponsible, but also bad filmmaking and needs to be punished."

","Snatch, a testotorone enhanced film was a crowd pleaser the last night it played at the Sunset 5. The audience laughed heartedly and applauded concluding the picture. Bringing the street lingo of underground england the director juggles more than 25 male characters, no females throughout the movie. Each character is so well balanced with all the others that each player has its own credibility. The style, talk, body language of each is so authentic it boggles the mind and at the end of the film when you realized its over, the actors were so cemented and good and entertaining it seemed cartoonish in a kind of positive way. Turkish and his innocent slick sidekick consistent and calm in caos. One punch mickey cracked me up and being no fan of him began to respect him a little more.

And the movie was, by all means.<br/><br/>But sometimes there is more to a movie than just the plot. Consider the details that you experience in this movie, and you'll know what I mean. First of all, the ""Gipsy-Pitt"" is a geniously played part. You'll understand 50% of what Brad Pitt is saying, but that's how it is supposed to be. Another detail that is excellent, is the cutting from L.A. to London. Three small cuts, that is mixed together, and makes it understanding that a person leaves from one city to another. Great details here.<br/><br/>As when it comes to the actors, I would say that the two best ones here, is Benicio Del Toro, as a gambling diamond robber (by the way a good Rabbi), and Brad Pitt as a ravelling gipsy.

Brad Pitt has had a terrible career. Brad Pitt thought that having a pretty face and muscles makes you a good actor but, as countless others have proved before him (including the abysmal Keanu Reeves), that is not enough. So Brad Pitt took a lesson from Johnny Depp on how to overcome your pretty face by choosing challenging, unexpected and difficult roles in films not intended to be watched by freckle faced brace wearing teenage girls. Brad Pitt has finally switched ranks and hopefuly, after the Fight Club and this film he will never again shave.<br/><br/>As this is Ritchie's second film, he is excused from making the same film again (with bigger budget, snazzier cast etc) but, he will not be able to make another film that looks like a Smirnoff/Guiness commercial if he wishes to develop his undoubtebly original talent."

The funniest scenes were the three black guys in the car and also the attempt at robbing the bookies (especially when trying to escape through the door!).   I was impressed with Brad Pitt's character and the fact that he was prepared to make the movie for a huge cut in fees (and I also notice his name was not top of the bill).

Almost all movies this year thus far have been complete c**p. All hype and not living up to its word, something which Hollywood is fond of. However Snatch rises above all that jargon and comes out as a sly comedy that is well acted and even better written. I came into the theater and kept telling myself that this wasn't a direct sequel (although it did use most of the same actors from Lock Stock) and to watch it as if I never knew Guy Ritchie's work, and it worked. But some viewers might find this hard due to the fact that Lock Stock was such a good movie, which it was. But in my opinion this was better. The movie itself is very high paced and fun.

The lack of a central core of 'good guys' makes rooting for any of the characters harder, so just sit back and enjoy the violence & humour full on. Vinnie Jones is bigger & better as Bullet Tooth Tony with some great dialogue thrown his way this time and the thoroughly unpleasant Brick Top (Alan Ford) is one mean bastard that you just want dead as the film climaxes.<br/><br/>More full on than Lock Stock but less believable, this is a pumped up adrenalin fuelled 'go faster' version; more muscle, less fat and so possibly not quite as tasty for everyone but still a cracking 2 hours of escapism......"

","Spoilers<br/><br/>Despite what others say about this just being a copy of lock stock, it has a lot more class and style and has a much better plot and cast, it goes along the same lines, but shows ritchie has matured in to a better director since his last film. The plot revolves around a stolen diamond that everyone is after and bareknuckle boxing fights that are supposed to be rigged, but keep getting ruined by a pikey, (irish gypsy), who keeps knocking his opponents out. The story is very interesting and moves along at a fast pace making sure you don't get to caught up in the plot, some parts are funny, others brutal, and others just fantastic to watch, (the final fight with micky, and a car accident involving three different sets of main characters, shown from three different angles, brilliant). The main characters are interesting and likeable, (all apart from, brick top, who i thought was a bit nasty when he could of been a bit funnier), turkish is a good lead, and brad pitt puts in a fantastic performance making you wish he was on the screen more often. Great film, and will probably have american appeal because of the varied cast with names americans will recognise.<br/><br/>10/10"

I'll only mention a little of the story: A Jewish gangster from America,Franky Four Fingers(Benicio del Toro)steals an 84 karat diamond from Antwerp,but he runs into trouble with his Russian partner's brother,Boris the Blade(Rade Sherbedgia).Boris asks him to make a bet for him at a bookies that is to be robbed by the three stupidest prats ever to wear balaclavas:Sol,Vinny,and Tyrone(Lennie James,Robbie Gee,and Ade)Soon Franky's boss,Cousin Avi(Dennis Farina),comes to London searching for him with the help of diamond expert Doug the Head(Mike Reid)and invincible hitman Bullet-Tooth Tony(Vinnie Jones). While this is going on two boxing promoters,Turkish and Tommy,(Jason Statham and Stephen Graham)are trying to hire a gypsie bare-knuckle boxing champion Mickey O'Neill(Brad Pitt)who knocked out their previous champ in one hit after an argument involving a dodgy caravan.Their boss,Bricktop(Alan Ford),is very unhappy,not only at Turkish and Tommy,but also at the three silly prats who robbed his bookies. I know it seems like I've told you the whole story,but trust me,this is just the tip of the iceberg! Anyway the acting is brilliant.Jason Statham and Stephen Graham are a very dynamic duo and play it all convincingly,Vinnie Jones is an incredibly admirable bad arse,Rade Sherbedgia's role,though short,is well played and very memorable,and Alan Ford is one of the best bad guys I've seen in a long time.However,Brad Pitt steals the scene,even though his Irish-Gypsie accent is so strong it takes several viewings to understand everything he says.('Fock mi,'es a bik block,bakser?Ya lak loike a bakser.)

The build upto this film was more anticipated in England and Europe than it was in the US, because of the initial impact of Guy Rithice's recent 1998 independant release of ""Lock, Stock & Two-Smoking Barrels."" Snatch uses pretty much the same script plan as Lock, Stock, only with a much larger budjet at hand, as well as some big hollywood names in the pan. The film's identity is dogged down with the appearance of Bennico Del torro (FRANKY-FOUR FINGERS), & partly by Brad Pitt (MICKEY). But somehow in an odd way, Pitt balances out nicely and does the film jusitce with his exellent take to a seedy pikey (Irish-liek slang, but either Irish or English dialect) accent, and dodgy make-over. Dennis Farina (COUSIN AVI), without making any offense...does a great, if not comical job of portraying the frustrated, greedy American/Jewish diamond jewller intent on getting things flow his own way, fed up with the constant ""alienation"" from his much-loved artificial world of ritches, facing upto a hunt into the heart of the seedy British underworld. The film is fast paced with shifty, effective editing techniques (more jumpier than the ones in Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, that diserse the viewer from the past to the present, and add enthusiasim to the shear comedy of the irony which is ""accidental.""

"Buddy-51","Null","0","1","27 January 2002"," incoherent, smart alecky gangster picture
","With `Snatch,' it would appear that the films of Guy Ritchie can now be officially consigned to that dubious category known as `an acquired taste.' Having enjoyed his previous work, `Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,' I guess I can say that I acquired that taste to at least some extent a few years back.  Now, having endured his most recent film, `Snatch,' I can safely say that I have `unacquired' it since.<br/><br/>`Snatch' is a muddled, incoherent mess of a film, filled with plot mechanics and an assortment of characters so inscrutable as to leave the audience, first, confused, then, indifferent and, finally, downright hostile.  I refuse to even attempt to cope with unraveling the complexities of the plot here, since Ritchie himself obviously couldn't be bothered with doing so himself.  Suffice it to say that it has something to do with a bunch of foreign and homegrown mobsters in England vaguely involved with Brad Pitt as an amateur Irish gypsy boxer.<br/><br/>With all the conflicting accents emanating from the mouths of the characters, fully a third of the dialogue is downright indecipherable Moreover, Ritchie is so busy indulging in his trademark camera and editing tricks that all hope of keeping up with the action disappears five minutes into the movie.  The flashy, hyperkinetic visual style is too cute by half, but even that is not nearly as cloying as the insipid attempts at trendy humor that pepper the criminals' lame interactions with each other.  As to Brad Pitt's agreeing to appear in this film, I have a few suppositions:  he did it as a favor to the director; he just couldn't resist the temptation to show he could pull off an accent for an entire film; or he had a hankering to return to the boxing arena after having gotten into such good shape for `Fight Club.'   Whatever the reason, even Pitt is unable to rescue this dreadful affair.<br/><br/>(For those who care, yes, Madonna does make it onto the soundtrack of the film).<br/><br/>`Snatch' is little more than an irritating, annoying and off-putting exercise in directorial self-indulgence."

Although the plot is fundamentally slapstick and will at no point tickle your grey cells, Ritchie paints a picture better than he builds a story. Not a movie with a beginning and an ending.

The writers of this movie tried to be very original and in my opinion they succeeded greatly, creating some of the most hilarious characters and plot twists. Although this movie is a little excessive in violence, it doesn't have so much that you just want to turn it off. And the swearing in the movie adds to the comedy perfectly. When it came out it wasn't advertised that widely which I think is a good thing because movies with too many previews are no fun to watch because you go in knowing the plot.

It doesn't dare let them do anything that might come across as dorky.  Look at ""The Limey"" or the recent ""Shaft"", and tell me that this fear of being uncool isn't stifling.  (By contrast, the gangsters in ""Pulp Fiction"" are given the chance to make complete fools of themselves ... and maybe, in some people's eyes, they do; but at least they don't come across as insufferable posers.)<br/><br/>The gangsters in ""Snatch"" are varied, fascinating, and (in most cases) positively goofy.  Some of them are cartoons, but with a substratum of reality, and Ritchie, like Charles Dickens, wisely arranges things so that the cartoonish aspects of different characters are not allowed to get in each other's way.

","A gangster story revolving around the sale and subsequent loss of an 84-carat diamond. Much undercover goings-on, with some fine performances directed by Mr. Madonna, Guy Ritchie. Vinnie Jones, Mike Reid and Brad Pitt all play their parts, but the story primarily follows the adventures of Turkish, the boxing promoter-cum-inept criminal and his efforts to promote Mickey (Pitt) in bare-knuckled fistfights, which are rigged for the sake of the reddies. Very much character driven, the story lacks depth and plays the 'Lock, Stock' card far too often to be called original in any sense. Entertaining nonetheless, but in a forgettable way. A film that has tossed away it's best lines without too much care and attention. 'This is a boxing match, not a tickling competition', for instance. As I said, the plot is thin and it appears that the story fell together by accident, though the characters are both credible and believable. Thumbs up for the casting and acting roles. Not something I would take my children to watch due to the choice language and graphic violence and also not a picture I would choose to view again, though it was enjoyable in a one-off sense.

","Guy Ritchie and the boys show that Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels was just a launch pad.<br/><br/>Snatch juggles more characters, more convuluted plotlines and more gags than Lock, Stock, and is a far more satisfying treat.<br/><br/>The cinematography is spot on the money, slick without looking like a commercial. The soundtrack is pumping, and even manages to fit in a (personal joke?) Madonna track.<br/><br/>Every principle, of which there certainly are a few, turn in excellent performances, bringing their cartoon character gangsters to life. Bullet Tooth, Four Fingers, Brick Top? Do people really have names like these?<br/><br/>Brad Pitt manages to invent a whole new language (pikey), Mike Reid shows he does have a life outside of Eastenders and smutty stand up, and there's even a chance for Ewen Bremner to roughly reprise his role as Spud in Trainspotting.<br/><br/>Catch it before ze germans arrive."

","A new bread of films are out and yes Guy Riche is posing Tarantino with His lock stock movies. drama+comedy+crime+noir = Pulp... Bruce Willis+Woody Harrilson = Jason Statham in an unforgetable piece of junk. Dont kid me wrong this is an acceptionaly good piece of junk- one of the most beutifull trash piles ever compiled by an englishman (honestly the best thing thats come out of England since the 60's). Snatch Adds crazy camera angles, Bizzare cinematography, Frame hopping, and twists and turns that will leave a viewer with his head up his ass. A new aged film that takes 2 or more different situations and runs them into eachother faster than starbucks is taking over America. A car crash with primary charactors that has to do with main charactors throwing milk on their wind shield with cessation to proke more main characters to get into Extrinsicality a fancy word desiphered in English to be a ""mishap"". Yes this is a Must SEE for pulp fans but those of you who are just out to see PITT shining like he normally does you will be deeply disappointed. This is not as good as its brother (Lock Stock and 2 smoking barrels) but is alot funnier. Magnificent Directing By Riche and even better acting by the cast members. And for those of you who would like to see Austin Powers aged to about 70 years keep your Eyes pealed for the sick old ""bullet Dodger"" who chops up men and feeds them to pigs (a similar sickness idea/skit to Pulp Fictions ""the gimp"").<br/><br/>enJoy!"

","First off, I can't believe this kooky $3-million movie came to our local cinemas, we usually only get the $100-mil blockbusters.  I saw it twice in the theaters and bought the DVD as soon as I saw it.  This is the kind of quirky, dangerous, offbeat humor the intelligent moviegoer can really sink his teeth into; toss in a couple of characters you care about, a couple of characters you really want to see get hurt, a storyline you don't expect, and add some way flash dialogue.  The musical choices made for this movie are perfect; I downloaded a couple of singles from the soundtrack and then just went out and bought the cd.  If you enjoyed Get Shorty, Pulp Fiction, or Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, do not wait one more minute: you must go now and rent this film.  After this and Lock Stock I can't wait to see what writer/director Ritchie comes up with next."

","Heartened by the high Imdb scores for this film, I finally caught up with this one on cable.<br/><br/>Managed to watch it all the way through, but with a growing sense of depression. It really is absolute garbage. All the old favourites were here, fourth-rate soap actors, the vicious Mr Big, the wide boy and his dumb mate, the dodgy diamond dealer, all played in one-dimension, all played in that uniquely self-congratulatory way which says: `This is a British gangster film and this is the way to act in a British gangster film', and with loads of smart-ass camera tricks and editing thrown in.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FROM HERE ON!<br/><br/>And of course Vinnie  how this man gets away with it is a mystery to me  the scene where he keeps shooting the Russian bloke who refuses to die is possibly the crassest piece of film ever created.<br/><br/>The main warning sign for me was when for no reason at all someone introduced a cute and lovable dog into the film..imagine the surprise and hilarity when later on, with ideas running out and desperation setting in, the dog runs off with the diamond and swallows it! Surely someone involved in scriptwriting or directing could have said `Come on, we can come up with something better than this..'<br/><br/>And what on earth is Brad Pitt doing in this  doing his `Fight Club' bit of the booze-swilling, chain smoking guy who somehow has a perfect physique!<br/><br/>
A few reviewers have compared Snatch favourably with Pulp Fiction  I don't see it  Pulp had Travolta at his coollest, Willis, Keitel, Jackson and Thurman on top form, as well as pace, style and a bit of thought put into it.<br/><br/>Still at least Snatch was better than Lock Stock and two smoking barrels."

","In 40 years of being obsessed with movies I have NEVER been this obsessed with what I believe to be a premier masterpiece of modern cinema. Save your comparisons to Pulp Fiction, et.al. There is no comparison. Period. Guy Ritchie has delivered a fun, intriguing, and very complex tale filled with some of the most hilarious ""cartoon"" characters in recent memory. Mobsters, bookies, boxing promoters, gypsies, ex-KGB agents, diamond thieves, pawn brokers, a 400lb. ""getaway"" driver, corpse eating pigs, and ""the"" dog...did that about cover it? No morality play or modern day issues here, just jaw dropping hysteria. I've seen it 20 times and it just keeps getting better. The critics can go to hell. And if you didnt like this movie you havent seen it ""enough"". If it didnt make sense, go back and watch it a second and third time. And rather than trying to compare this work with Tarantino, etc. take some time to contrast the characters at work here. The mad logic of the ""unhinged"" Bricktop played by Alan Ford vs. the subtle cool of Turkish, played brilliantly by Jason Stratham, a former real life street con(see opening scene in ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels""). The ruthless machinations of Boris the Blade vs. Bullet Tooth Tony's cold blooded efficiency. And of course Brad Pitt as the leader of a pack of roving gypsies is the highlight of the film. His manipulations supported by a charming but unintelligible Cockney rhyming sing-song delivery, and backed up with his fists make this a delightful rocket ride through London's dark underbelly. 10/10"

","An instant classic of the crime genre, anyway you slice it. Snatch was a perfect combination of action and violence found in the best proportions, the special humor that seems to be specific to the crime genre, and the quirkiness and attention to detail present in the most artistic movies. Thought not likely to be hailed as one of the best movies, if Snatch's graces were to be measured in entertainment value, it would greatly outweigh some of the other classics of the genre, including Pulp Fiction, and possibly even The Godfather (most certainly the sequels.)"

The acting done by all the actors in this movie are superb. The directing is superb. The sound...superb. The plot...outstanding. I must say that whoever wrote this movie sure is a funny guy because there are lines in this movie that i would never had thought of in a million years. The only bad thing i noticed about Snatch was it's partial leaving out of important information.

","The first time I saw this movie (last year), I really liked it but I was kinda confused as to what was going on. All the different, loosely connected storylines made it really hard for me to follow. So I watched it a second time and then I slowly started to get the jist of it. Now, it's a year later and I recently bought the collector's edition of the DVD and I just can't to seem to get enough of this movie! <br/><br/>I think that this film is very brilliantly constructed to give the viewer a sense of just how topsy-turvy, unsettling, corrupt, seedy, and brutally violent the London underbelly really is. All the flashy, fast-paced cinematography really gives off the sense of a world where everyone has to watch their backs and everyone is double-dealing with everyone else.<br/><br/>I seriously think that there are quite a few rising stars in this film. Jason Statham and Vinnie Jones both have very promising film careers ahead of them, as do many of the other unknowns in this film. Brad Pitt does an excellent job exercising his comical side. I think he should do more comedies. Everyone did an excellent job in this movie. I think that, as a director, Guy Ritchie is gonna go far. He's got an unbeatable style."

The way he often bleeds timelines of the various characters both together and apart was done much more effectively in The Limey than it was here (though the car accident sequence was handled very well).<br/><br/>Brad Pitt leads the cast as the odd-speaking Piker, and both his and the ensemble's acting is superb.  My only complaint in terms of the actors was the relatively small role that Benecio Del Toro had.<br/><br/>This film is definitely worth a watch (see it on DVD so you can turn on the subtitles so you can understand Brad Pitt)."

"ruby_fff","6","0","1","25 February 2001"," Beyond the ""Snatch"" of a diamond - ""I Went Down"" is a gem of a sleeper
","Writer-director Guy Ritchie's ""Snatch"" is full of British humor and jabs at the underworld of thieves, swindlers, and the not-so-smart crooks. Its visual presentation maximized graphic design communication styles like typographic key words and symbolic icons as connections or suggestive rebus. The whole movie is kind of like flipping through a comic strip, albeit it's breezy and fun, enjoyable if you like that sort of thing. It's an ensemble cast with catchy names: Benicio Del Toro is Franky Four Fingers, Brad Pitt is One Punch Mickey, Rade Serbedzija is Boris The Blade, and Dennis Farina is Cousin Avi. Watch out for the little dog - you might say Ritchie's attention to details includes direction of this star of a dog.<br/><br/>Another film that comes to mind on 'quirky' small time gangster tales is the Irish flavor ""I Went Down"" 1997. It has more substance and depth of plotline and characters; another darn good performance from Brendan Gleeson (who was superb as Martin Cahill in writer-director John Boorman's ""The General"" 1998, based on true life story.) Peter McDonald of ""The Opportunists"" 2000 was the reluctant protégé alongside Gleeson in this small gem of a sleeper. ""I Went Down"" has its equal fun logic, yet it's a crime story with a difference beyond Hollywood hang-ups. A tip: do not try to see ""I Went Down"" in a hurry, it's kinda like a steady road trip, as the two leads get to understand each other better, and perhaps reveal the purpose/philosophy of it all. After all, there's more than meets the eye (or ear, rather) the banters we hear between Gleeson and McDonald - it's a well-written script by Conor McPherson, and directed by Paddy Breathnach with Irish finesse."

I loved this film and laughed so hard my wife looked at me a couple of time and elbowed me to stop it.  I love dark humor and this film is full of it; this movie is not for the politically correct crowd, its more a back lash to the violence in the media people.  Brad Pit plays the role of a crazy perfectly, and has this on going joke where you could only understand half of what he says.  You would get this joke if you lived or visited Nova Scotia or some place similar (I have) or got relatives who speak in a heavy English dialect. Its the same language but you can only make out about half of what is said.  Pitt's character puts all the events into full swing of 5 different stories which meld into one, like Pulp Fiction.  This film has shooting, boxing, butchering, and very nasty dialogue, with a good story to boot.
