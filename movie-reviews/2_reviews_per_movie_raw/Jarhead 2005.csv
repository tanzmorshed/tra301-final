"splatzer","8","698","737","6 November 2005"," A realistic glimpse into our history....
","I was reluctant to see this movie. As a veteran of Desert Shield/Storm, I spent my first 90 days in-theater in the Weapons Co of A Swofford's Battalion. I later was moved to the 1st Bn of 7th Marines, but having been in the same unit for some of the same time I felt I could offer readers a unique perspective on the film's accuracy.<br/><br/>From a purely aesthetic perspective I thought the film was well done. The acting was very good, and the script was well written, witty, and accurate. The actors were well suited to their roles. My personal preference for a good plot would have been disappointed were it not for my personal interest in the film. In my opinion this film is an outstanding dramatic-documentary, so adjust your expectations accordingly. If you are expecting a driving plot line and all the accompanying dramatic tension, then I think you will be disappointed (as many whose comments I heard exiting the theater certainly were). But if you think of it as a chance to take a glimpse into a point in history, and see it as some of those who lived it did, then I think you will be impressed.<br/><br/>Many people may think that the obscenity of some of the interactions was overdone for effect. But whatever anyone's personal judgment of that behavior, that is the closest portrayal of Marines (or soldiers) being themselves I have yet seen on screen. Marines are vulgar. They do watch porn. They do fight among themselves. They do both hate, and love, the Marine Corps. There is an omni-present anti-war conspiracy theorist. The do say ridiculous things. There are some who are over the line. The reality of the Marine Infantry is that things happen there every day that are well beyond conventional sensibility, and which strain credibility to the average civilian. It's all true. I love the Marine Corps and I am still serving - I don't have an axe to grind. It just happens to be true.<br/><br/>Are there parts of the film that I find incredible? Yes. But they are not the essential things. There is a scene, it's even in the trailer, in which everyone is firing their weapon into the air. I wasn't there, but I can't fathom a breach of discipline on that scale. I can't say it's impossible, but I am doubtful. But whether it's true or not is not important. At its essence this is a film about Marines, how they adjusted to the Marine Corps, each other, and a war. If there are a few incredible details, then we can just be grateful that Hollywood didn't impose a car-chase on us.<br/><br/>This is a film about Marines. At that time, there were very few who turned down scholarships to Ivy League schools to come in. We were from strange backgrounds. We were obscene. We did want to get our kills. Many of us were frustrated that our war was only 100 hrs long. We knew we were filling the footsteps of giants - the Marines of Iwo, The Chosin, Belleau Wood - and I think we all wanted a chance to earn a place next to those men. In our wild, adrenalized youth, those aspirations just took the crude form of looking for a kill. Or at least that's how I've put it in perspective 15 years later.<br/><br/>If you go and see this film, try to recall yourself at 18 (as I was). Suspend your judgment of the obscenity and vulgarity until you're sure you would've done it differently. I can't speak for Swofford, but I am still incredibly proud of my service there. The insanity of this film reminds me why: because it is characteristic of the immense hardship that our youth bears on behalf of the rest. Do the characters look stressed? It's not hyperbole. We were 18 and we thought we were going to die over there. Still, at H-Hour, everyone marched North. In my opinion, you better fill some big shoes before you judge that. <br/><br/>So don't go into this film champing at the bit to pigeon-hole it as ""Anti"" or ""Pro"" war, with all the pre-fab rhetoric that comes with such a judgment. You have an opportunity here to look back into our little moment in history. Swofford has invited you into our memories. They are not Right, and they are not Left, they are just our story as Swofford lived it. If that kind of thing interests you, then go and see this movie."
"scottmey","10","520","647","4 November 2005"," A true and realistic story
","As someone who is in the military, I thought this movie was perfect. If you are looking for a message about war or politics you won't find it here. This movie is strictly a story told by the main character about his time serving in the Marine Corps and his tour in the Gulf. It is true to life. From the language, situations, to the way the characters interact, the film is right on with accuracy.<br/><br/>The film is shot with striking cinematography. Scenes in the desert, especially with the oil fires, are breathtaking. The shots are done perfectly and originally throughout while the score and soundtrack takes it to a powerful emotional level.<br/><br/>The film will receive bad reviews from a political standpoint. I read a couple before I saw the movie that all stated they didn't like the movie because it had no message or stance. To that I say good. It was refreshing to see a movie as a movie. I was glad that it was just a story, and there wasn't any motivation underneath it. That's not to say that the movie is one dimensional. There are many undertones, just none of which are attempting to reassert or defame the current war in the East.<br/><br/>See this film if you want to see a humorous, sad, psychotic, intense, and most importantly REAL story."
"Juansmith","7","383","487","24 October 2005"," Pleasantly surprising
","I saw a promotional screening of the film, sponsored by my university. Following the screening was an audience Q&A with the author (and main character), Tony Swofford.<br/><br/>And it was no surprise that the very first question from the audience was, quite ambiguously, ""Do you support the military?"" When Swofford dismissed the question as too broad and complex to be answered with a simple yes or no, the inquirer followed up with, ""Well, do you support the war?"" Swofford dismissed this even more readily.<br/><br/>To me, this was perfectly representative of how the film handled its potential political implications.<br/><br/>As Troy says early on in the film, ""To hell with politics. We're here now."" And that's essentially how the movie went. <br/><br/>It bypasses the soapbox and simply tells you how it was, from the perspective of a single soldier. And while the opening boot camp scenes may seem like Full Metal Jacket Lite, the rest of the film is truly unique.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes directs with his usual brilliance, showing once again his affinity for bright, vivid color, even in the largely monochromatic desert.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal gives an excellent performance as Anthony Swofford, complemented by the able talents of Jamie Foxx and Peter Sarsgaard.<br/><br/>The film's only real flaw is that, like the war on which it was based, it's pretty slow, and not a lot really happens.<br/><br/>In the strictest sense, I would have a hard time even classifying this as a war film, and it's certainly not a deliberately political film.<br/><br/>But in its own way, it tells an intense, personal story. Beyond that, you're simply left to make your own judgments.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Cooldude3","9","480","620","10 November 2005"," Here's a simple guide to Jarhead, without an agenda.
","I am not a professional writer, I am not a director, I am not important. I just enjoy movies. I'm not writing this to convince you of my opinion. I'm not even here to give you a professional review of this movie, or sound educated and witty. I'm here to give a layman's take on the movie and not be concerned with politics or agendas.<br/><br/>1: Cinematography is downright beautiful in this movie. There are some unforgettable shots. Easily a contender for this year's cinematography award.<br/><br/>2: This is not an action war movie. If you want it to be, find another movie. Black Hawk Down might be closer to what you're looking for, although finding an action movie about Desert Storm is kind of hard.<br/><br/>3: This movie will invoke emotions. And just about any person can pick out a lot of evidence to support why they liked it and why they did not. A person can pick out a lot of evidence supporting the military, and at times make it look like a recruiting tool, or it can show anti war, anti-Bush, anti everything. It will make those that like to argue and takes sides, have a wonderful time with it.<br/><br/>4: The acting is good and realistic. It shows the happy carefree side of war, and also the darker undertones, and not-so-under-toned evils of war. <br/><br/>5: The military prepares people to become soldiers, just like a coach prepares people to become athletes. And once you are one, it is hard to switch it off once a person goes back to normal life. Even quote/ unquote ""desk jockey's"" and those that aren't in the actual combat but provide support roles, are still trained to fight.<br/><br/>6: Media and movies have not helped our perception of war and those involved. They've been putting a spin on things for a while now, and they like to beat a lot of dead horses.<br/><br/>7: This is based on a true story. No matter how ""Hollywoodized"" a movie can get, it's basic concepts and ideas are still generally intact. And Swoff was actually there. I was not.<br/><br/>8: To me, Jarhead felt like the Full Metal Jacket of this generation. With extreme's of both ""anti's"" and ""pro's"" you take it or leave it. Full Metal Jacket is a good movie for taking the approach that it did. Jarhead is no different.<br/><br/>9: Don't hate on anyone trying to do their job, if you see someone in uniform, don't think negatively or positively, unless you know the person. You don't know their story. If you want to find out, just listen. That's all, nothing more. Don't just wait for your next chance to speak.<br/><br/>10: Find a way to see Jarhead, reserve your judgments until afterward, and if you're a jerk, then give all the snotty, ignorant, or mean opinions you want. You won't change anyone's mind, just tick them off.<br/><br/>To finish up, this movie will make you feel something. Let it go. No wonder people's stress levels are high. If you offend easily, lighten up. If all you can do is go around in life and get offended, then I am truly sorry for you. Now, I'm going to grab a beer from the fridge, sit down and watch a movie, to have something to do. Nothing more."
"Scott112082","10","301","407","27 October 2005"," Bold and Brilliant Melancholy
","JARHEAD is the third in a string of successful films by Sam Mendes, first wowing audiences with American BEAUTY and then continuing our admiration with ROAD TO PERDITION. With JARHEAD, Mendes solidifies himself as one of the most extraordinary filmmakers working today.<br/><br/>The first thing that may surprise audiences is that this is not necessarily an anti-war piece. Mendes and screenwriter William Broyles, Jr. have been careful not to make this film narrow in view. Instead, by focusing on the psychological turmoil of one soldier, Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal), JARHEAD is able to speak specifically about this man's experience and how it relates to those around him.<br/><br/>Mendes drenches the screen with sights and sounds that literally envelope us in the horrors of warfare. These explosions of vision and noise are counterbalanced, however, with scenes of great sadness and warmth. One scene that comes quickly to mind is a boot camp drill where the young soldiers are crawling under barbed wire--the sound design is such that we hear every character screaming or grunting as the gunshots zoom overhead. But then, the scene changes. An event occurs that allows Mendes to silence all of the violence and machismo of war. Amongst the hysteria of the scene, one of the soldiers freaks out and a gunshot is discharged. Mendes lets the camera witness this as if it hadn't expected it to occur. The characters are in shock, and so is the audience. It's just one of many powerful moments where Mendes changes from loud, visceral warfare to quiet, poignant moments.<br/><br/>Not that there's much warfare here. In fact, the lack of warfare becomes a theme for this film. Peter Sarsgaard, in a great performance, reaches his breaking point during the final third of the film, and it's a riveting moment where the lack of warfare has finally made him explode. His performance is very strong throughout, but it is not until the second half of the film when he finally gets the chance to break loose. Don't mistake the first half of his performance as simply being on-screen... charisma that palpable doesn't happen by accident. It is because he uses his scenes and lines wisely in the first half that we end up so engrossed and fascinated by him in the second. A true supporting performance. Oscar nomination hopefully on the way.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx surprised me here, and not because I didn't think he was a fine actor. Obviously, he is. But his character is so well-conceived, and works wonderfully as the counterpoint to the Gyllenhaal character. Foxx plays his scenes confidently, but also with touches of gravitas that, even in RAY, we haven't seen before. The scene that we get a glimpse of at the end of the trailer is wonderful in its fullness, and helps Mendes' film give us a well-rounded opinion of Swofford's opinions on the war. Foxx is by turns hilarious and profound.<br/><br/>And then there was Jake Gyllenhaal. Wow. This is an incredible performance. Watch for a dozen scenes where he literally explodes off the screen, but how he also juggles the quieter moments with great aplomb. What makes Swofford an intriguing character is that he doesn't always get our sympathy; or, for that matter, want our sympathy. He is scarred by war and his family and the life he left behind, and he is just looking for a way to get out of the sand and the sexual dysfunction of war and the lack of gunfire. Gyllenhaal captivates our attention from his very first glimpse, and his voice-over performance laces the film with irony and melancholy. He is a great physical presence in the film as well. I could cite more than a few dynamic scenes that he performs masterfully in, but I'll just mention one. Swofford points a rifle at a fellow soldier after a failed night watch, and then turns the rifle on himself, asking the fellow soldier to discard a round into his mouth. It's an indescribably painful scene to watch, but it's also an example of Gyllenhaal's brave and honest portrayal of this bruised man.<br/><br/>Some people have begun to write about this film as lacking structure or story, and in saying that I'm afraid they may have missed the point. This is a story about ambiguity of self, about dislocation, about ambivalence to war and love, about sexual frustration. In these terms, I think Mendes & Co. have found the perfect way to cinematically allow us to experience the same sort of blank complexity that Swofford must have felt. And that's why I find this a remarkable adaptation of a memoir that I admire deeply.<br/><br/>I could go on and list scene after scene that make this a memorable film, but I'll let you experience it yourself and decide for yourself. In summation, JARHEAD is a viscerally unforgiving, psychologically heartbreaking masterpiece.<br/><br/>I don't know that this is an ""Academy"" film, but it is certain to garner nominations. I would nominate it as: Picture, Director (Mendes), Adapted Screenplay (Broyles Jr.), Actor (Gyllenhaal), Supporting Actor (Foxx), Supporting Actor (Sarsgaard), Editing, Score, Cinematography, Sound."
"bobhendry","9","333","453","6 November 2005"," From a Marine from that era
","At last - a movie that simply shows it like it is... No ""Rambo"" superhero-idiotic-nonsense; no overdone, melancholy, attempt at cinematic artistry at the cost of authenticity - such as is found in ""Platoon"", ""FMJ"", ""Apocalipse Now"" and ""Deerhunter"" - to name a few overrated war movies.<br/><br/>Finally a movie which captures the FEEL of being a Marine in the eighties... the sights, the sounds, the events - all brought back vivid memories. As the scenes unfolded, I found myself thinking ""... I remember when that happened..."" over and over, because my service somewhat paralleled Swofford's own, and I was aware of - if not a witness to - certain events that took place. A movie which portrays the Marine grunt for what he is... certainly no angel, but the absolute backbone of American military toughness. The barracks and field life portrayed in this movie is perhaps the most accurate portrait Hollywood has produced.<br/><br/>With only a few realtively minor technical inaccuracies, this is a movie whose full richness can probably only be experienced by those who were in the Corps at that time. And for that degree of accuracy, I am grateful to the author and those who produced the film. Too often producers and directors overlook the details that make a military film credible to veterans - such as the details of the uniform, the sounds and function of weapons, the behavior of the characters. Not so in ""Jarhead"". And the dialogue was right on.<br/><br/>Having read several of the other comments, it is clear to me that there are events depicted in the movie which may not be clearly understood or properly contextualized by someone who has not served in the Marine Corps infantry. Do not let that stop you from seeing the film - it is an excellent view into a world most people will never see. I left the theater feeling proud of my service, and although I miss the daily life of an active duty Marine, ""Jarhead"" left me feeling strangely happy to be able to look back on it - and to sleep in my own home, my own bed, tonight. Yet, for many Marine veterans, the hope remains in the back of our minds that the phone will ring tomorrow with an opportunity to go back and lead men once again - and yes, for those who might wonder, even in Iraq or anywhere else - as the line in the move so eloquently put it ""Forget the politics. We're here now."" Such is the fidelity of a rough-hewn few who are ready to fight when called upon. Grunts really don't expect most people to love us or understand us, but we hope there are some folks out there who might appreciate the fact that we are there. I think the movie captures that notion commendably."
"Quicksand","10","261","376","2 November 2005"," Every War Movie is Different. Every War Movie is the Same.
","More than anyone, I would imagine that U.S. Soldiers would have a more specific opinion of this film than anyone else. They were there, they were in it, no one knows better than they.<br/><br/>And there are two kinds of soldiers: those who loved it, who took great pride and honor in serving their country... and those who saw it as just a job, got out, and got on with their lives. ""Jarhead"" is based on a book, written by a U.S. Marine, who falls squarely into the second category.<br/><br/>He does not judge, he does not come out as for or against the war. This is not a political movie, yet will still make some people uncomfortable, and it should. ""Jarhead"" lays out the experience of one particular Marine from boot camp, to (suddenly) Operation Desert Shield, to Operation Desert Storm. What happens here is not always pretty, but it is the truth, and the truth should be all we can ask for.<br/><br/>The screenplay was adapted by William Broyles Jr., who in addition to some TV work, adapted the recent ""Planet of the Apes"" remake, and ""Cast Away."" Personally, I didn't think either of these films were anything special, which is why ""Jarhead"" is such a surprise. Not a lot blows up, there's no huge siege like in your typical Vietnam movie... it's a surprisingly affecting study of this one man, the experiences he had, the people he knew. It's about the Corps, and it's about brotherhood. Our main character, Swof, never judges, never mentions politics, is only the best Marine that he knows how to be.<br/><br/>As Swof's friend Troy says at one point, ""F*** politics. We're here. All the rest is bull****."" Which is all the movie is about, really. This is what happened. Take it or leave it."
"twim23","7","229","339","27 October 2005"," Full Metal Witch Project
","Just saw an advanced screening of this tonight. While it isn't the film that has been so brilliantly advertised, it's a very solid film. It feels a lot like ""Full Metal Jacket"" early on, but with more humor. Then, it becomes an entirely new animal. More of a psychological study. I would actually call this the ""Blair Witch Project"" of war films in that you (and the characters) know the Boogeyman's ""out there,"" you're just waiting for him to strike. And the longer you wait, the more stir-crazy you become within your own mind.<br/><br/>The acting is superb and the cinematography is stellar. It's an anti-war film without being distinctly liberal about it. It's a true story, and for the most part, Mendes tells it like it is. So, you can make your own judgment about it. But based off what you see, and all that happens, you have no choice but see the absurdity, not only in war, but perhaps in some of the USMC's tactics as well. It's heartbreaking to see what an experience like this can do to young men. <br/><br/>If you're looking for action, this is not the film you're looking for. No heroism, judgments, insight, or hope. Just the documentation and reflection of build up, the destruction of lives, psychological torment, boredom, camaraderie, and...waiting."
"trcbmc","8","75","110","10 November 2005"," Not a John Wayne Movie
","""Every war is different,"" says Anthony Swofford as the movie ""Jarhead"" comes to a close. ""Every war is the same."" Looking back on his experience, he sees that the first Gulf War and the Marine Corps have become ineradicable parts of who he is: ""Every jar-head is me."" The screen shimmers and shifts into a scene of a desert patrol dwarfed by distance and hazed by heat waves. ""We are still in the desert,"" he says. The screen darkens. The credits begin to roll. <br/><br/>A critic once observed that audiences emerge from a comedy talking animatedly with one another, but after a tragedy they come forth subdued and solitary, each absorbed by his or her own thoughts. <br/><br/>""Jarhead"" is not a tragedy but a tragic coming-of-age story. As in ""The Last Picture Show,"" a young man discovers what a cruel, destructive business life can be. Swofford emerges from a war that has consisted of a long, maddening wait followed by a hard march through the surreal aftermath of battles already won by jets dropping smart bombs, toward a horizon blackened by Saddam's burning oil wells. He returns home to find that his girlfriend has left him for another man. His best friend, who suffered with him through the combat that never came, dies as a civilian, possibly a suicide, as he was thrown out of the Corps with a dishonorable discharge. <br/><br/>Subdued and solitary, I waited outside the theater for my wife. <br/><br/>""So, what did you think?"" I asked her when she came out. ""Definitely not a John Wayne movie,"" she said. ""No,"" I responded, reminded of Clint Eastwood sharing a victory cigar with a young Marine beneath an American flag raised atop a hill in Grenada in ""Heartbreak Ridge."" <br/><br/>""It wasn't as dark as the book,"" I said. ""In the book,"" she replied, ""you couldn't see Swofford's smile."" <br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal does display an engaging, youthful grin in the early part of the movie. He plays the twenty-year-old Swoff very well. And Jamie Foxx does Sgt. Sykes brilliantly. Against the backdrop of a night made at once hellish and spectacular by blazing oil wells, the Sergeant tells Swoff that he (Sykes) could have joined his brother and had a nice safe job stateside, but with no chance to see such sights as this. ""I love this job,"" he says. ""I thank God for every day he gives me in the Corps. Oorah... You know what I mean, Swoff?"" Foxx's delivery is flat, point blank, neither sarcastic nor enthusiastic. He is an exhausted soldier giving himself a pep talk he scarcely believes in any longer. Get out your Oscar Nomination forms.<br/><br/>At dinner we tried to recall what was book and what was movie. I did not remember the scene in which the soldiers are interviewed by a TV journalist from the book, but from Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket."" From ""Full Metal Jacket"" also, I believe, came the bizarre business of a soldier's sardonically making a corpse his buddy. The war-is-surreal-hell moral of the movie reminded me of Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" - a film the young jar-heads watch with sexual intensity in Mendez's movie. But the scene in which the soldiers sit down to enjoy a home movie one Marine's wife has made - of herself being humped by their next door neighbor - that, we all agreed, was in the book. <br/><br/>I remember when ""Battle Cry"" came out in 1955. Unlike the Boy-Scout-clean soldiers of most WW II movies of that era, these Marines said Hell and Damn. And one of them actually shot the finger at some troops riding past - What a shocker! <br/><br/>A Jacksonville, NC Daily News reporter interviewed several Marines from the local base who saw the movie. Excerpt:<br/><br/>Their reviews seemed to be positive, especially concerning the portrayal of the relationship between Marines and how deployments and war are mostly about sitting around and waiting.<br/><br/>""I thought it was good,"" said Lance Cpl. Richard Usher, 19, from Tampa, Fla. ""From what I know, it's accurate. They did say 'Oorah' way too much."" <br/><br/>Lance Cpl. Josh Rader, 29, of Georgia, said he thought the movie was one of the more accurate portrayals of the Marine Corps, with the only more accurate movie being Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket."" <br/><br/>""A lot of the training, they dramatize it more,"" Rader said. ""I'd say it's probably more accurate."" <br/><br/>Lance Cpl. Adam Blades, 20, with 1st Battalion, 2nd Marines, agreed, but took exception to the actors' ages. <br/><br/>""The actors were a little old,"" he said. ""The majority of guys going over there are like 18 and 19. But it was pretty cool. As accurate as I've seen."" +++"

For that brief moment, the Vietnam Vet saw and felt what he should have years earlier... affirmation and recognition. I am sure it was an intended (and embedded) allusion to that injustice.

Well-crafted, strongly acted, and extremely political the film certainly holds your interest, but the script is unfocused, the subject matter never truly compelling, and the momentum slows more and more as it goes along.

"NewMillenniumllc","1","81","156","8 November 2005"," Distortion and Disappointment
","Having served three years in the Marine Corps as an enlisted man, two in Vietnam with an infantry company in combat, I found the film to be a major distortion of the Corps. The film generally sets out the Corps as a unit that has no direction and their officers and staff NCO's are idiots (i.e the Bn Commander acting like a rock star during his speech to the troops in the tent). I assure you this simply not the case. I spent 27 months in Vietnam and never saw anyone in that type of setting that conducted themselves anything other than serious and professional. As aside, during my time in Nam I had six Bn commanders, so I know from experience these facts.<br/><br/>In addition, the film suggests that the Corps operates with poor equipment, and again I assure the reader the equipment may not be the latest (such as the Army enjoys), but it always operational, notwithstanding normal wear and tear issues. A great example is the battery problem shown in the film. Being a 2531 field radio operator, I take exception to that scene in the film. No properly trained radio operator ever goes into the field without two batteries, both of which are checked for charging prior to leaving a rear area. This is only one of numerous such operational distortions in this movie, which leaves the viewer wondering about the professionalism of the Corps.<br/><br/>Being somewhat of a film buff I found the entire film to be fragmented (poorly edited, poorly filmed - almost surreal), and without any direction to guide the viewer. Finally, the acting was shallow at best, including I am sadden to say, Mr. Fox's performance. Comparing this film to ""Full Metal Jacket,"" which I found to be factual and well executed, is like comparing a college freshman film director's work to one of the greats like Houston.<br/><br/>This film served no one, not the viewing public, not the actors and other technicans who worked on the film, and most certainly not the Marine Corps. Honest critical thinking about war and the military presented in a film is always welcomed by an informed society, but historical distortion pretending to be art is simply that, a pretender."
"Uriah43","5","3","3","4 February 2013"," Somewhat Flawed
","This film has some excellent parts to it but at the same time it comes from a perspective that is somewhat flawed. I say this because the author, LCpl Anthony Swafford, was very immature and his resulting lack of discipline caused him to leave the Marine Corps with a disgruntled mentality. The book this movie is based on reflects that skewed outlook. Add to that the fact that there are always inevitable additions Hollywood inserts to make a film even more sensational (than the book itself) and one should be able to understand that everything is not necessarily as it seems. For example, there is one scenario where the marines are told to don their protective gear and play football in 112 degree heat. Well, since military training is supposed to be as realistic as possible I suppose this could happen-but only for a very short duration and certainly not at the pace depicted. Later on, when they are then told to drink out of their canteens (while their protective masks are still on) we find that some members have busted canteen tops or have been missing their drinking tubes for some time. And I doubt this very seriously. First of all, these marines were deployed to a combat area where the use of chemical or biological agents against them was considered very likely. That being the case, their gear would have been checked and inspected repeatedly and on a regular basis. Further, any defects would have been corrected almost immediately. After all, this was a front-line military unit and not a group of reservists put together at the last minute. Now, for some people this might seem to be a minor issue, but this is just one item (out of many) that gives the appearance that these marines were sent into a combat area for a lengthy time and then totally forgotten about. So, while this might have been the message the author was trying to convey, the fact is that it may have been more his perception than actual reality. And again, his perception was probably clouded by his attitude more than anything else. That said, this film essentially revolves around a very narrow (and possibly imagined) point-of-view. To be sure, our soldiers and marines had to endure a very long and trying stint in the desert. It was lonely and they felt anguish for their loved ones back home. To that end, this film does a very good job of capturing the monotony and sense of isolation. But the ""hurry up and wait"" scenario is hardly a novel concept in this day and age any more than it has been with many armies for thousands of years. For example, siege warfare often lasted months upon end without the conveniences these marines had. Same thing with the Japanese soldiers on isolated island atolls during World War II. Not to mention the marine's Iraqi counterparts on the other side of the border who had to endure B-52 strikes with only their cardboard bunkers to protect them. Now, I don't say this to belittle the experiences our soldiers and marines had to endure, day in and day out, for over 6 months in such an arid and hostile environment. Again, it was a definite accomplishment and I think this movie does as much as any film can to capture that ordeal. But there were times when it seemed LCpl Swafford did more than his share of whining about his circumstances. Once again, it goes back to the source. Likewise, I thought there were some scenes which didn't need to be included and only served to make the Marine Corps look bad. That is not to say that the foul language wasn't unusual or that sex wasn't on the minds of these young marines. But was it really necessary to show them in such a crude fashion? Well, I suppose it might be if one had a negative attitude about what it means to be a marine. And again it all goes back to the author and possibly to those in Hollywood who have never served in the military. In short, this movie had some good points and it had some bad points. The depiction of the ""highway of death"" and the oil fields burning were definite highlights. But the negativity and crudeness brought on by the recollections of someone who was clearly bitter about his experience seemed to distort reality and diminish the overall effect."

","It's that haunting final line of ""Jarhead"" that pierces the viewer most. Sam Mendes' superb adaptation of Anthony Swofford's novel is the best and most artistically astute ""grunts-eye-view"" of modern warfare since Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket."" Mendes successfully does for Desert Storm what Kubrick did for Vietnam.<br/><br/>We are provided here with a full array of the varied types of men (the bored, those looking for a way out, the slightly crazy thrilled at the chance to blow things up and kill people, those with some vague sense of the honor serving one's country has brought to generations past) who go to war, and how in the end ""All wars are different, but all wars are the same."" Expertly displayed here is the utter futility of our modern wars in the Middle East. Most of the film's runtime is dedicated to the boredom the Marines experience as they train endlessly in the desert to fight some distant enemy that never really shows his face. The war is quick and the men are sent home without ever firing a shot at the enemy, yet, as it is so beautifully noted, ""We are still in the desert"" and men and women are still being sent to fight a war for what....oil? Oh, and the oil is beautifully on display here, lit up at night across the desert sands and raining down on soldiers and corpses alike with wanton abandon. Cinematographer Roger Deakins takes over nicely for the late Conrad Hall as Sam Mendes cohort in capturing jaw-droppingly beautiful cinematic compositions and painting them on the big screen.<br/><br/>Some have complained that ""Jarhead"" lacks an emotional core, but I dare you to find more emotional scenes than Jake Gyllenhaal coughing up a mountain of sand in a frenzied nightmare, Peter Sarsgaard cowering in the tower in the midst of a psychological breakdown after not being allowed to take the sniper shot he has been training endlessly to take, or one of the final scenes where a nameless Vietnam vet hops aboard the bus as the Marines come home to cheers and a parade in a sad and haunted attempt to experience the hero's welcome he never received for his war.<br/><br/>All war movies are not the same, and this one is a bitter cut above the rest."

","There's a scene in which Swofford and his fellow Marines are watching the scene in ""Apocalypse Now"" in which the Vietnamese village is attacked by napalm-bearing helicopters and the gooks are all blown to pieces in a shower of bullets and jellied gasoline. The Marines are cheering wildly and the killing. They couldn't be happier that the natives are being fried. That's what's supposed to happen to the enemy.<br/><br/>They missed the whole ironic point of the scene, of course. The world is simply not a Biblical one of clear good and evil. But if they missed the point, it's not simply because a lack of sophistication and a desire to destroy is part of their adolescent nature, but because they now belong to a system that reinforces that view.<br/><br/>I think I kind of missed the point of THIS movie myself. I'm not sure why it was made because it doesn't tell us much that's very new. The scenes in boot camp, I'm absolutely certain, were vital to the development of Swofford's character and those of his colleagues but it's not very new. We've seen it before in movies like ""Full Metal Jacket."" Not that it's filled with clichés -- the bragging Texan, the Brooklyn wise guy. Those are absent. It's just that there's nothing much to replace them. A football game that must be played in heavy chemical suits in 110-degree heat for the TV cameras looks, sounds, and probably is real enough, at least until the Jarheads start ripping off all their clothes while the cameras roll. Other incidents, like a truck full of parachute flares that explodes accidentally on Christmas Eve, are a little weak in credibility although, okay, maybe it did happen.<br/><br/>The film shows us that the Marines are bored to distraction while waiting to be deployed in a combat area. There is an interesting description of how latrine waste is dealt with. But it's a little more disgusting than it is funny. The antics of the bored aren't very funny to a mature audience either. And there's very little drama.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal I don't find to be a very appealing actor, although I haven't seen him in anything else. Peter Skarsgaard is fine, and so is the staff sergeant.<br/><br/>Chris Cooper, as a cheer-leading officer, is GENUINELY funny because he's not trying to be. He asks his troops something like, ""What do we do with the enemy?"" ""Kill 'em!"" ""I must be going' deaf because I can't HEAR you!"" ""KILL 'EM!"" ""Eww, now I got a real (erection)."" The movie needed more scenes like this. The first time most of us probably heard that routine -- I can't hear you! -- was either in second grade or at a summer camp in the Poconos. And here are these bemuscled Behemoths eagerly playing the same game, so steeped in a subculture that promotes blowing heads off and producing ""the pink mist"" that they don't realize the reptilian level at which their brains operate.<br/><br/>That's not to demean the Marine Corps. We need a Marine Corps, and in order to do the job they may have to do they must be trained to do that job without hesitation, in the unswerving belief that it is the right thing to do, the Biblical thing to do. And they're not ""retards"" or dummies who are easily brainwashed either. I taught at Camp Lejeune for a few years and was never disappointed in their cognitive abilities.<br/><br/>The problem isn't with the Marine Corps or with the young people who buy into the organization's values but with a larger and deeper system that makes the Marine Corps and its members necessary. It's a system rooted in human nature that knows no national boundaries and doesn't recognize uniforms.<br/><br/>But that raises Big Questions that a movie like this, of essentially ethnographic ambition, isn't designed to deal with. The spirit of Camus hovering overhead notwithstanding, the movie is careful to avoid controversial considerations. Skarsgaard says, ""**** politics. We're here, and that's that."" What we get out of this movie is a picture of day-to-day life as it was for Swofford. And the photography is splendid. Otherwise, it left me a little unfulfilled."
"nprovenzo","1","47","96","13 November 2005"," 'Jarhead'The real 'suck'
","In 1987, Time magazine ran an infamous cover that consisted of a marine in his dress blue uniformwith a blackened eye upon his face. The cover was intended to depict the shame befallen the marines after the Clayton Lonetree spy scandal and it was met with outragehow dare Time sucker-punch the entire Marine Corps because of the crimes of just one of its members? Yet after seeing the movie ""Jarhead,"" Anthony Swofford's autobiographical account of the marines during the first Gulf War, a black eye is the least of the marines' problems.<br/><br/>The fundamental theme of Jarhead's portrayal of marine life is that heroes do not exist. One cannot depict the Marine Corps accurately without noting that at least some of its members perform feats of strength, endurance and bravery, and that to build an entire institution of such men, certain virtues are required. Yet like Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, a movie acclaimed for its supposed depiction of Viet Nam-era marines, none of these men and certainly none of these virtues are to be found.<br/><br/>Instead, what one finds in Jarhead are empty men who drift though life, denied of what they truly want, and who choose to make up for it in emotional outbursts and sadistic and debased pleasures. Again and again, this is what Hollywood sees when it looks at the marines.<br/><br/>Yet as far as I can tell, there's no massive backlash by marines against this moviein fact, I'm amazed at the positive reaction many marines have had. Are these marines so starved for heroesso hungered for a portrait of their lives in uniform that they will find merit with those who portray the character of their commitment as utterly bereft of meaning or purpose, simply because the actors put on a marine blouse or use a jargon that rings familiar? <br/><br/>I served five years in the Marine Corps during the time Jarhead was set and I can certainly recount stories, both humorous and horrific. But overall, if I had to characterize my and my fellow marines' service, it would be the honorable commitment to the betterment of one's self and the defense of the American nation. The men I worked with might not have talked about it everyday. There might have been the occasional breach of conduct or character, and some may have even failed miserably in achieving the standard of excellence that is the hallmark of the corps.<br/><br/>Yet overall,(and in the metaphysically significant sensethe only sense that matters in art) almost every marine I knew was in the corps for a purpose and that purpose was good, noble, and just.<br/><br/>That's why I, for one, was proud to wear the marine uniform, and that's what no Hollywood movie that I know of has ever been able to accurately capture in a film about the marines. Given the freedoms the marines have fought so valiantly over their history to preserve, it's a tragedy they haven't received better from Hollywood in return."

","Jarhead, from Sam Mendes, is a good, solid movie with interesting characters and almost poetic dialog. Yet the previews for this movie were very deceiving, making the film look like a gritty, violent war movie, almost like Three KIngs (which is a much better movie). But it's not. The main theme of the movie is boredom. We watch these soldiers go through intense training, verbal and physical abuse, and ultimately see nothing come out if it. Jarhead is very well acted, especially Jamie Foxx, and is a visual feast for the eyes, with some of the best cinematography in the movies since Legends of the Fall. <br/><br/>9 out of 10"
"Floated2","5","4","5","4 September 2018"," Somewhat generic but has its moments
","Jarhead (2005) the war drama film starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx, sees a group of marines and their quest search in battle. The film at the time seemed to have been praised widely but as time has passed and now over a decade since it's release, this film doesn't seem as great as it was when it came out. Reason being, there have been many more quality and better war/marines/solider films such as Jarhead.<br/><br/>Though this film is not bad, it somewhat feels generic and lacking of complete emotional balance. The performances are their but the general tone of the film seems to resemble and MTV based film rather than a serious awards type film (such as the Hurt Locker or Hacksaw Ridge). Also mentioned that this film is not just a War film, it is able to mix some comedy and drama, with such issues as Mental health. The cinematography is great and Sam Mendes' direction is holds up but in general, something about the film feels lacking."
"Degree7","5","4","5","15 May 2013"," A solid, but slightly derivative war song.
","2005 was a very revelatory year for the actor Jake Gyllenhaal. Not only was he cast in a daring role as a gay cowboy in the Academy Award nominated 'Brokeback Mountain', but he also pulled off a very convincing portrayal of a hormonal, combat fueled jarhead that is swept up into the desert boredom of the early '90s Gulf War and Operation Desert Shield. <br/><br/>There is a lot to admire in this adaptation of former marine Anthony Swofford's reselling of his Desert Storm experience. Sam Mendes once again proves his visual acuteness that he demonstrated in American Beauty and Road to Perdition. He once again takes advantage of hand-held camcorders in key documentary scenes, although by now it starts a little bit to feel like he's retreading old ground. But the grain-filled picture and oil stricken, bombed out, barren landscape gives the desert a hypnotic and gritty beauty that adds a visual splendor to the affair.<br/><br/>More important is the casting, particularly Gyllenhaal in the main role. His frustration and existential angst as he battles insanity in the desert heat provides insight into the psyche of the marine corps, and what a defeating engine it is that swallows up these young men's lives. From what is portrayed here, fairly realistically I might add, it shows how their station in Kuwait and the Saudi oil fields is 99% boredom and 1% sheer terror, as the anticipation of the looming war advances. And when that war never materializes, the results are quietly devastating. These are people conditioned to kill and explicitly follow orders, and when their aggression goes un satisfied, they direct it at any other outlet they can as the pressure mounts. They truly do end up salivating like Pavlov Dogs. <br/><br/>While parts of the film feel derivative of previous war flicks, with the training ensemble and devastation of the country's infrastructure resembling 'Full Metal Jacket', and the voice over narration recounted by Swofford on marine life similar to 'Platoon', Jarhead is still a solid and engrossing psychological drama that shows a heartbreaking truth in how these men never really escaped the desert heat."
"innocuous","2","4","5","4 November 2009"," Perhaps it helps to remember...
","that ""Jarhead"" is based on a book written from one man's point of view after serving as a Marine. I suspect that the movie (and book) say more about Swofford's personality and what was meaningful to him during his service than what the Marines are actually about. I have not served in the military myself, though many friends and acquaintances have. They confirm many of the factual aspects of the film, but demonstrate a completely different understanding and perspective of the experience.<br/><br/>Does military service include long periods of boredom? Sure. But just think, for example, of the number of troops in WWII who spent literally years away from home, with only written correspondence to connect them to friends and loved ones. Many of those NEVER saw combat and (quite frankly) may have had little or no effect on the outcome of the conflict. Not all Marines (perhaps not even a large portion) ever fire their weapons in anger at an enemy.<br/><br/>Ultimately, my impression is that Swofford has the type of selective memory common to many college students, who seem to remember the drunken parties, the sex, and the fraternity hazings best. Other students remember the more valuable aspects of the college experience, especially when they appreciated the opportunities at the time they attended college. I suspect that Swofford is accurate and factual in most of what he describes, but it does not paint a complete picture of the Marine experience anymore than a John Wayne film does.<br/><br/>OK, back to the film. It's also boring as hell and should never have been made by Mendes. There is no need to watch it."

","Jarhead is strictly Hollywood - a movie of ""sound and fury, signifying nothing."" On a recent radio talk show, I heard a friend of one of the Marines portrayed in the movie say that the guys hated the movie, that it was not an actual depiction. The movie depends on the F-- word (among others), nudity, alpha-macho-male conduct (preying upon one another in the barracks), and obscene cavorting in order to ""entertain"" the audience. I'd hate to think that all Marines serving in the Middle East are immature, crude and immoral individuals. The entire movie is designed to ""set up"" today's military as a cadre of idiots. Not a single admirable character in the bunch. Come on now! Is that reality?

"LadyLiberty","7","24","48","6 November 2005"," Jarhead Brings Gulf War Home
","I remember the Gulf War all too well. It was my own initial experience with a ""television war"" (those who are older doubtless remember that the Viet Nam war was the very first of those), and I was terrified of the repercussions even as I couldn't look away from the anti-aircraft tracers lighting up my TV screen.<br/><br/>Jarhead, as many people know, is a slang term for a US Marine. One of those newly minted jarheads is Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) who, largely to even his own surprise, finds himself enduring the rigors of basic training and then still more brutal training for his assigned specialty. Swoff tells one drill sergeant that he's in the Marines only because he ""took a wrong turn on the way to college."" His explanation doesn't go over well. Later, he does everything he can think of to drum himself out of the Corps.<br/><br/>Eventually, between the friendship and support of his partner, Allen Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) and the tough example set by his commander, Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx), Swoff becomes very, very good at his new job: a scout sniper. Needless to say, when the news breaks that Saddam Hussein has invaded Kuwait, Swoff's group is one of the first to be sent overseas.<br/><br/>The troops are welcomed to the desert by Lt. Col Kazinski (Chris Cooper) who commands a large segment of the Marines deployed there, and who tells them they must maintain constant vigilance and be ready to fight at a moment's notice. But months go by with nothing to do but drills and more drills, and the boredom, anxiety, heat, and desolation of their circumstances begin to wear. The men, of course, find some very creative (and usually very naughty) ways to entertain themselves and each other during this time. But when war is at last declared, they move out like the professionals they've been trained to be.<br/><br/>In the midst of burning oil wells and charred vehicle convoys, Swoff and his company make their way into enemy territory. They endure enemy fire and fear; fights amongst themselves and utter despair. And then, as suddenly as it began, the war is over. But despite the brevity of Swoff's experience (his own fighting war lasts only a little over four days), he and everyone else is changed by their experiences, and not all of those changes are easy to live with.<br/><br/>Jarhead gives us the firsthand experience of one soldier in the Gulf War with all of the attendant good and bad moments. As such, it's fascinating in and of itself. But director Sam Mendes has added dramatically to the story with some truly brilliant edits, some creatively managed flashbacks, and some astounding settings (the burning oil wells are bizarrely heart breaking even as the depiction on screen is awesome; the destruction wreaked by American bombs is graphic and moving). Of course, the fact that the film is based on a book written by the real Anthony Swofford about his own experiences in the Gulf War means that even Hollywood effects can't take away from the back of our minds that much of what we see is real, or at least was.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal has become a very good actor indeed, and holds his own with Oscar-winner Jamie Foxx, whose performance could very well garner him another awards season nod for his supporting role. Peter Sarsgaard is also just terrific. The rest of the supporting cast  who have far more limited roles  is also good. In fact, the one real criticism I have about the film is that I would have liked to have known more about each of the men who served so honorably and who were so altered by that experience.<br/><br/>Jarhead isn't a war movie per se in the sense that it shows a lot of shoot 'em up action. But it may be one of the few war movies that actually conveys graphically the sheer boredom and hurry-up-and-wait that is the reality for many soldiers. And that the men perform so well despite the emotional obstacles of where they are and what they might have to do, and that they're a cohesive group when it counts no matter the flaws of each or any of them, is unquestionably honored here. I recommend Jarhead for virtually everybody.<br/><br/>POLITICAL NOTES: The comparison between the Gulf War and the current conflict in Iraq is inevitable, particularly as some continue to believe that Saddam Hussein should have been deposed in that war rather than as a part and parcel of the current and ongoing War on Terror. But the very real difference between the two is that in the first, Americans were viewed as the liberators of Kuwait. In the latter, some countries look at Americans as the despots who overthrew a sovereign nation. While perception doesn't win or lose battles, it does make the difference between victory and defeat in the court of public opinion.<br/><br/>Obviously, it's tempting to call that opinion inconsequential. But the reality of it is that such opinion can shape alliances, trade, and more for years to come thus making mere perceptions important to everything from national security to economic health. Regardless, however, Jarhead does serve one important function and that's to humanize our fighting men and to reinforce the fact that they are fighting for our country and for freedom. Whatever your opinion on anything else, I'd hope you'd remember at least that much.<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY: Jarhead is rated R for ""pervasive language, some violent images, and strong sexual content."" Parents should be aware that the R rating is entirely warranted. But with that caveat, I'd recommend Jarhead for mature audiences who are interested in current events, the military, or just plain good movie-making."

They're very similar to many other such scenes over the years but most likely with a greater abundance of colorful words and expressions, most of which probably aren't permitted to be printed here. Once we leave training and head to what's supposed to eventually be war the film has a rapid descent downhill.<br/><br/>Pulling an audience in with the promise of a Marine sniper in action and then never even having him fire his weapon really sucks. There's an old adage in writing that if a weapon is shown on a fireplace mantle in act one it better damn well be used by act three.

","Sam Mendes, director of ""American Beauty,"" the critically acclaimed film that brought him an Academy Award for Best Director, brings to the big screen ""Jarhead,"" a movie based on Andy ""Swoff"" Swofford's war memoir, which is more or less the same kind of war film we've all seen before. In it, Swoff is played by ""Brokeback Mountain"" co-star Jake Gyllenhaal and the film shows in its gritty language and sardonic humor the former sniper's recounts of how they live each day fighting boredom until they go to war.<br/><br/>Upon his arrival at the Marine base, Swoff is assigned to C Company. There he meets his friend Troy (Peter Sarsgaard), a member of the elite Marine unit, and Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx), who picks him and Troy for sniper duty. Then commences Operation Desert Shield and over they fly to Saudi Arabia. Itching for some action and increasingly becoming bored creatures in the desert, Swoff narrates their long wait while suggesting some techniques ""for the marine to use in the avoidance of boredom and loneliness."" <br/><br/>Basically the film's first part tackles the hell of a boot camp new recruits have to undergo. ""Swoff"" recounts how he was conceived, how screwed-up his life is, and how he got in the military. In many ways it feels rushed that sometimes you would like it to maybe linger in some scenes and hear more from him and the others. Some parts of the script also don't hold up well and may seem tedious to more cynical members of the audience.<br/><br/>The second part of the film is set in the desert. The problem here is the absence of genuine tension as the film avoids much of the battle and gore in lieu of a bunch of men finding whoever they are out in the scorching desert. But there's not enough depth, and the somewhat uneven pacing of Mendes in the movie's first part tantalizes the audience with only a bit of character background. There's little emotional connection, and there is virtually nothing for the audience to root for.<br/><br/>""Jarhead"" treads very much the same area its predecessors had and without a clear stand on the theme it tackles, it appears relatively banal. That's not to say it's a bad film per se. It is a middling film with good acting and good cinematography. But coming from a director with a pretty impressive resume, somehow one can't help but ask for more."
"dewit_jacco","1","24","49","10 August 2006"," Awful movie, bad acting, bad jokes, unreal atmosphere
","What an awful movie. I was so surprised to see IMDb-visitors rated it 7.3 average! Yeah, yeah, I know, I am not ye' movie critic, but I do believe I have somewhat of an opinion, when it comes to movies. In fact, I consult IMDb rather often, before renting or buying a new DVD and I must say that (with very few exceptions) I always agree with the IMDb-rating of a movie (of whatever kind, by the way). Having heard a lot about Jarhead and IMDb's rating (from 6 and up, the movies are mostly good - real good), I saw Jarhead yesterday and I was very disappointed. Sam Mendes is a good director and I was left in awe. SO bad! The acting was far below anything I have ever seen. There's a bunch of B-movies with better acting. Jokes were not at all funny, drama was pathetic, tension, what tension? Realistic? All a bunch of crap. The storyline wasn't that bad, but it died in bad acting, useless scenes (what was that about his horse? - covered in oil, ah, how sad ... and then?). The burnt bodies lying around, the dead of Troy (was that Troy, by the way? - who cares?), his girlfriend who left him, the idiotic so-called climax when they bomb that base on the end. I am sorry, but I have no idea why you dudes and dudettes rated this movie so highly. Maybe I didn't understand? Was it all a satire on some movie I haven't seen? Was it supposed to be sad, shocking, cult? There was absolutely nothing in this film that caught my attention (except for the fact that I was bored throughout the whole thing). Could someone please explain me why he/she thinks this movie deserves a 7.3 avg? Not for a moment Jarhead was interesting (no, please, don't give me the: that's-exactly-what-it-was-about-crap - to film boredom, one must not bore the viewer with bad acting, bad jokes and emphasizing so much on (the lack of) sexual relationships. Das Boot didn't need all that. And THAT'S a movie, worth 9 outta 10! Anyway, sorry I saw it. But even more sorry for the fact that 'the people who are supposed to know' rated it that high.

","“A man fires a rifle for many years, and he goes to war. And afterward he turns the rifle in at the armory, and he believes he's finished with the rifle. But no matter what else he might do with his hands, love a woman, build a house, change his son's diaper; his hands remember the rifle.” <br/><br/>This is the essence of Jarhead. It’s not about peace, it’s not about war. It’s not about governments, Iraq, or morality. It’s about the people, those who are bred and trained to kill someone and the ramifications of that instruction.<br/><br/>Make no mistake about it; a human does not inherently want to kill. Studies have shown that there is an impulse that makes a person hesitate before killing another (whether this is nature or nurture is another argument). All armies understand this; the way they take a civilian and turn them into a soldier is by beating and sweating it out of their recruits until they are a well-oiled machine. But what happens to these men when this part of their being is torn from their bodies? <br/><br/>As Swofford (played subtly but sublimely by Jake Gyllenhaal) goes from boot camp to sniper school to Iraq and then home again, we see thousands of images of destruction and the loss of innocence as these men are bred to kill. Swoff’s family, wrecked by his father’s ruined psyche (incurred from Vietnam). Swoff hit by his drill sergeant for uttering an independent (and anti-authoritarian) thought. Swoff laying in the mud as Staff Sgt. Sykes (Jaime Foxx) chews out a dead man who, while training with live fire, could not control his urge to run and as a result, got killed. Swoff and the marines cheering on the Valkyries of Apocalypse Now. Swoff almost killing a friend because the poor guy messed up.<br/><br/>Marines (the Jarheads, that is) don't see this as bad. When Swoff is transferred and stumbles upon a man being branded, he believes that he, too, is to be branded. Troy, played by Peter Sarsgaard, tells him not to worry; to be a part of this glorious tradition, he has to earn it.<br/><br/>And Swoff laps it all up. He’s hooked. He wants to see the Pink Mist, the splatter of brains when the sniper hits his mark.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes (director of American Beauty and Road to Perdition) lays it on a bit thick at parts, but it’s necessary to the point being made. Endless seas of sand reflect the boredom of the soldiers as they await their orders. A horse walking through a burning oil field, covered in petroleum, sees Swofford and the two become one. White and non-white soldiers channel their will to fight through a scorpion fight. And in the end, it all breaks down when they finally see some action, just as the war is ending.<br/><br/>Why does Troy break down in the end? Why, when the responsibility of picking off an Iraqi official is taken away from him, does he attack his commanding officer? He won't even take the shot; that’s Swoff’s job. And yet, Troy breaks down and weeps. Because the one thing in life that he is good at, the one thing that he has been training himself for and desires, has been taken away from him. He has it in his grasp and it is taken away by the very people who taught him to do it.<br/><br/>And what about Sykes? He’s not the typical superior officer: he’s not R.Lee Ermey’s near-psychotic Drill Instructor, even though he humiliates Swoff for trying out for bugling (again, to show contempt for the non-marine, the innocent), nor is he a strict father-figure in the vein of Lee Marvin’s Major Reisman, although he does give good instruction and even speaks to Swoff man-to-man on one occasion. But what does he say? He could have a house, a car, a job with a great income, sleep with his wife every night, and time with his kids. So why is he here? “Because I love this job,” he says. “I thank God for every (expletive deleted) day he gives me in the corps. Hoorah.” This is both a parody of militaristic bravado by Sykes’s character and also an affirmation that he could not leave his job killing people even if given the choice.<br/><br/>So, what is it about this film that sticks out to me? The imagery is powerful, from the burning oil fields to the magic walls that open and close as they reveal pieces (or broken fragments, more likely) of home. The character development is also powerful, fully crafting over a dozen multi-dimensional marines (some for and some against the war) in a time when other films barely make one memorable character. But in the end, it’s the lack of answers. These men ask powerful questions – who runs the country, what am I fighting for, what are we going to do – not just of themselves or the situation or the audience, but of the soldier’s life overall. Beginning with conception, going through the boredom and terror of war, and ending when they return home, fulfilled and unfulfilled at the same time.<br/><br/>But even the end will not be the end for these Jarheads. After the war ends, Swoff and the men go home to find themselves in a parade. This is the joyous front, where people celebrate the warrior for a job well-done. Then they are faced with the dark half when a Vietnam vet jumps on their bus and salutes them. They are faced not with an option, but a mirror. This man – this sweaty, torn, and pathetic man – can’t escape Vietnam, even twenty years later, even when the country and his countrymen have forgotten him. And this is their future – Swoff, Sykes, and even Troy (despite getting branded and thus accepted) – without option. Their hands will always remember the rifle."

","This is not your typical war movie. For others that may be okay but going into this I was expecting it to be somewhat similar to FMJ or Platoon. This movie revolves around the boredom and lives of the soldiers. There is not an ounce of action except for a man getting shot in the head in basic training. It was highly disappointing, all the buildup and hell of training and they do not get to use their skills. There are also random scenes throughout such as a horse covered in oil, and I was very annoyed when Gylenhall and Saarsgard are told not to take the shot and an air strike is called instead. Praise for Jamie Foxx's performance though and the bit of humor throughout."

I like Jamie Fox in The Kingdom, which is a much better film. Jake Gyllenhaal was brilliant in Zodiac and End of Watch. I don't know if I've seen a film that spent so much of it's dialog on cursing as this movie does. As the story progresses you really feel the movie start to drag a bit and wonder if anything is actually going to ever happen. In the end this Marine unit misses the war and there is no fighting or shooting at all. Then to wrap up the movie is a retarded party seen with everyone drinking around bonfires and shooting their guns in the end. The only real saving grace of this film is Lucas Black's character and Peter Sarsgaard to some extent. There are so many much better war/military films then this, including the above mentioned The Kingdom and Green Zone if you like Middle East zones. I must also say that if this is how Marines typically act and are organized, they certainly aren't the well oiled machine I thought they were supposed to be."

","In 'Jarhead' Jake Gyllenhaal plays Anthony Swofford, a new marine recruit who is going to Iraq. Growing up he always wanted to do this, go to war and serve his country, but war is not what he imagined.<br/><br/>This movie illustrates the actual events of Desert Storm through the eyes of Anthony Swofford. Anthony Swofford was a scout/sniper in a USMC platoon in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait during the Gulf War. His book 'Jarhead' tells the story of the events that happened to him and his fellow marines.<br/><br/>Though I liked this film a lot, mostly for the realism, it did remind me too much of 'Platoon'. Unlike other war films, this movie is mostly uneventful, just like the war. This is what I think Swofford is trying to get across in his story. Here he is with his platoon, ready to fight, and they are not fighting. Casualties happen, from accidents mostly, but they do not get to fight. There seems to be no purpose for them being there.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal, Peter Sarsgaard (Troy), and Jamie Foxx (Sgt. Siek) are all really good in this film. But do not expect a lot of fighting."
"digitaldiva","Null","25","53","30 October 2005"," Jarhead, a very compelling film
","I was privileged to see a screening of Jarhead recently and fully concur with the posted review. I think it is one of the finer films of the year. The film will surely be a very controversial piece of cinema especially in these divisive post 9/11, ""America love it or love it times"". It's a shame because the film has less to do with the politics of war then the unique personalities that made up a specific platoon of Marines in the first Gulf War. The title of the film derives from Anthony Swofford's very compelling novel about his adventures, a book that in no way demeans the heroism of the young men (and now young women) who live and die in the military. Thankfully, the director, Sam Mendes works for a very even-handed screenplay by William Broyles Jr. Thankfully, Jarhead lacks the jingoist simplicity of earlier offerings like The Sands of Iwo Jima and is not another display of sincere but ultimately faux patriotism like a John Wayne offering. It simply tells it like it was. It is a very fine film that will assure Sam Mendes' position as one of the great directors working in films. Broyle's screenplay is excellent and the ensemble of young actors led by Jake Gyllenhaal, Jamie Foxx and Peter Sargaard is wondrous. Now the wait is on for an equally compelling work on the current military campaign in Iraq."

The direction which was made by Sam Mendes was very good and he presented very well the struggles of marines for their hard training to their operations in Gulf War. He also showed the other face of war, the true face of soldiers when they are prepared to go to war and when they are at war. Regrading the interpretations of the movie, Jake Gyllenhaal who played as Anthony Swofford was for one more time simply amazing, Jamie Foxx who played as Staff Sgt. Sykes was equally good and Peter Sarsgaard who played as Alan Troy made a very interesting interpretation.

","Good message, good visuals, good cinematography, terrible movie. This is the first movie I have ever rated a 1, and I hate to do it, because I don't like to think that there are movies this bad out there. The first thing about this movie to jump out at me as being inexcusably awful was the script. The script was not just poorly written, but it's completely unoriginal. From the get-go, we hear lines straight out of Full Metal Jacket, some word-for-word, some just copied with a change of words. Examples: ""You... like old people f*ck!"" Also how the drill instructor grabs the guy's neck and shoves him on the ground. Another copy from Full Metal Jacket is when the main character goes nuts and recites ""This is my rifle..."" The same thing happens to Private Pyle, he recites that line, kills his own guy, then turns the gun on himself. The only difference here is that the trigger isn't pulled. The latrine burning scene was copied from Platoon. Not to mention a two-minute scene from Apocalypse Now. Camels are also shot in Three Kings. The plot is inexcusable. Why are the small group of Marines marching through the desert in the middle of the night by themselves? This could only happen in Hollywood. Scene transitions are pathetic. The plot doesn't flow. The military behavior, such as the commander taking the time to argue with the main character's sniper partner while in the middle of calling in coordinates for an air strike, seems to not be realistic. The last scene, in which the two walk over a hill and are all of a sudden back at base camp, is hard to believe, as is everyone firing their guns into the air. What is the point of the movie? The ideas that the half-war is frustrating to the Marine Corps grunt and that war is pretty crazy do not take another feature-length movie to be understood. Lots of things just don't make sense and are evidence of a relatively thoughtless story. For example, the main character tells the drill instructor that his dad only talked about Vietnam once, and therefore convinces him that he is genuine. However, when we see his dad, he is wearing two dog tags at the kitchen table, which runs contrary to the idea that he was not open about it. This is simply careless movie-making. What is a horse doing in the middle of an oil field? It's a stunning image, but it doesn't make any sense. It seems like the creators of this movie thought that having Sam Mendes as director and producing artistic visuals in reference to the Iraq conflict would make people oblivious to the fact that the movie sucks. Apparently it worked on most of you people enjoying your dunk neck-deep in the excrement of popular mass media."

I had such high expectations for this movie, and what was funny was as I picked up the movie some guy next to me said get ready to be disappointed. I didn't think anything of it because I like to see for myself before I listen to someone else's opinion. Well boy was he right, I thought this was supposed to be about the Gulf War, instead we hear more about how the main character (Jake Gyllenhaal) likes to masturbate. Also I hated how they made the soldier's out to be like nothing but a bunch of horny perverts and complete dumb asses, which is far from the truth.<br/><br/>All I can say is if you want to see an entertaining movie along with a plot you need to look the other way. There have been very few times I have had to turn off a movie while in the middle of it. Sad to say but this movie was bad in all aspects. Bad performances by Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx along with the rest of the cast. I don't call using the f-word every other word acting, anyone can do that. There was no plot to this movie either, this movie would of been better off being called Soldiers Gone Wild because it was more about sex than the actual Gulf War."

Several seemed rather disappointed that the film wasn't more openly anti-war than it is; though politically a liberal, I was impressed by the effort to not take that obvious a stand and (for once) let the audience do its own thinking.<br/><br/>While the action takes place in a relatively restricted time, place and era, I'm willing to bet that soldiers from any war -- Peloponnesian, Hundred Years or Civil -- could identify with the characters and situations. For that reason, I particularly commend it to people who have friends or relatives in the service.<br/><br/>One mild warning: as in real life, the language and situations occasionally get a bit salty."

It almost seems as if the author has either never served in the military or is so dissatisfied with his experience that he had to put as negative a skew on it as possible.

","When we read movie reviews many of us take them with a grain of salt. ""Jarhead"" exceeded my expectations after seeing a high percentage of said reviews leaning towards the disappointing side. I have to say that the acting was well done by the majority of the cast, and that the transitions of the boot camp/shield/storm frames was easy to understand. Its hard not to compare a blockbuster war movie to ""Full Metal Jacket"", but I choose not to, because that is a high standard for any film to live up to. ""Jarhead"", for those who might have been misguided as to what it's about, is basically the story of a marine who is having doubts after joining the core and all the b.s. that happens while you are there. These include both the things that mess with your head from being in the desert for an extended period of time, and the things that you feel you are missing out on or have no control over that are happening at home while you are gone. With that said go see the movie, you won't be disappointed. Just don't expect ""Rambo"" type action, instead substitute a lot of real life situations that most people can actually relate to. You get all this while being entertained by a mixture of comedy and drama, but not lacking the action any war flick fan craves."

","Jarhead is probably one of the most controversial films I have seen this year...if not ever. I will make a bold statement and say that ""Jarhead"" will be for this generation what Apocalypse Now was for the Vietnam Generation. Without a doubt it will become a classic war film talked about for years. I didn't have a lot of expectation going into the film so it surprised me in many forms. I honestly didn't believe for a moment that actor Jake Gyllenhaal could impress me or pull off the role in this film. Jarhead seemed to me to be far grittier, and tougher than what I would have thought Gyllenhaal could do. I was very, very wrong.<br/><br/>In fact Gyllenhaal is excellent in the lead role of Swoff, a 20 year old soldier who chooses the Marines instead of college and then realizes far too late he might not have made the right decision. He leaves behind his youthful existence, his beautiful girlfriend, all for the sake of The Marines. Gyllenhaal only plays the new kid for a brief moment before he truly is one of the toughest sons of bitches there. He's hungry for action, he takes care of his new family, he trains, he follows, he leads, he nearly loses his mind and he is so incredibly watchable while doing it. He even overshadowed Jamie Foxx. That's not to say Foxx didn't pull off yet another incredible performance as Staff Sgt. Sykes. He's very tough on the men, a great trainer but deeper than that he's a great soldier and it shows. His deep set patriotism and love for the marines does show through in everything he does. Gyllenhaal definitely gets more of the performance though because his character goes through so many ranges of emotions. His performance is jaw dropping. Now let's talk supporting actor Peter Sarsgaard. He's been making a name for himself in the last year or so as the good guy who turns out to be a bad guy and I can't say I've particularly enjoyed his performances thus far. And yet here he is breaking that mold for me. His performance as Troy, the troops leader, is also stunning. His performances have always been very bland to me and at first I thought Jarhead would be no exception until you get to the meat of it all and he pulls off an Oscar Worthy performance. His emotions, and character will make you feel it. His scene opposite Dennis Haysbert of 24 fame (well at least that's where he gains his fame with me) was powerful!! Each character in this film and in their unit were so different, and gave us a different angle of the war and how each one of them felt, what they gave up, their lives before, during, and even after the war and the marines.<br/><br/>That's the brilliance of Jarhead. Sam Mendes made a war film that is against war, and a war film where there is very little war but rather the deep seeded effects of war. From the enemy, to the American, to the innocent civilians. The scenes of the decaying corpses on the roadside will make you sick and the symbolism and imagery in this film is just stand out!!! He doesn't stop at just showing us a war, he takes us on the entire life path of a solider. Beginning to end. He even shows us the side of the solider that so few war films ever show and that's after it's all over, the effects they have, how it changes their lives forever. ""No matter what a man does, he will always remember the rifle."" This is not your average popcorn and a movie kinda flick. This is far more intelligent than some will realize. The only downside to it is that it gives ""swear like a solider"" a whole new meaning because the language in the film will make your ears bleed. It's horrendous. Lately I've really come to wonder about the portrayal of the American Military in films. After seeing films like Tigerland and even this film the conditions in the military are horrendous. Is it really like this?? I'd love to know. I understand the conditioning of a solider and even why they would behave this way but still a film like this would make anyone shy away from ever wanting to join the military but isn't that the goal?? Isn't that the message here that these men and women love their country so much that they put their lives on the line and do whatever it takes only to be taken advantage of?? I don't know...right or wrong, I'm not on here to make that argument, only to say that Jarhead will make you think!! It's the greatest conversation piece in cinema in a very long time. I hope this film sweeps the Oscars because despite the political message and the hidden agenda that does exist, the performances are powerful and amazing. It does drag a little at times, and I'm not sure a single shot is fired which makes it all the more unique but you can't miss out watching these amazing actors. The film has humor, intense drama, horrifying scenes and captivating setting. The scenes shot around the burning oil wells are spectacular. Anyone wanting to see the most intelligent film of the year needs to check out Jarhead."

This movie showed all of the characters blood hungry and dumb. It had no character development. None of them l faced a challenge that changed them. They all lost control but it didn't matter because the movie eventually ended.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't even compare to Platoon or Tigerland. Both I highly recommend because both were written by Vets. Jar Head was written as a protest movie by Holly wood. After I watched it I felt spit on. This movie does not like the Corp or the military.

I know the movie mostly focused on Marines, but I'm sure the writers of this trash would blankly apply the same thoughts to all branches.<br/><br/>I am not, nor have I ever been enrolled in any armed services. I am neither republican nor democrat. To see this movie portray most every marine as borderline psychopaths who are socially and romantically retarded, implying that the only reason they serve in the forces is because there's nothing else they're capable of but pulling a trigger... it did nothing but leave a sour taste in my mouth and make me realize how biased Hollywood is, and how much they really don't care about who they trash.<br/><br/>So, to all you news-fed, brainwashed 'livestock' of today's generation, feel free to praise this movie and think it's nothing short of spectacular, but by no means believe this is an honest representation of our armed services.

","Like the previous entry, I too saw this at a promotional advanced screening at my University (Michigan State). Judging from the previews I thought it was going to be a modern day Apacolypse Now. I was wrong. The first 45 minutes or so is actually quite funny. They basically see no action and are just ""on guard"" so it gives a great opportunity for character development. I can guarantee that who ever you go with or where ever you see it, there will be a lot of laughs. After about an hour the movie starts to settle down and become more serious. Mostly because they actually start to go on missions. This is where the war part comes in. I enjoyed the fact that there was no politics involved, which is how I like my movies. The actors were superb. Jake Gyllenhaal is his usual brilliance along with Jamie Foxx and Peter Sarsgaard, who all deliver equally good performances. The main reason I really enjoyed this was because it was a war movie that wasn't afraid to show the non-war of war. It would be stupid for us to say that Desert Storm or the War of Terror is the same as Vietnam. This movie knows they're not the same and isn't afraid to make sure we know it. I agree it may be slow at times, but the humor helps carry it along with the performances. It also gives us a good look what the military is like with a modern perspective (i.e. Not a lot of action, cheating wives and girlfriends, and male bonding) Very enjoyable movie. Go see it. 8/10"
"Alakazam9","1","12","26","27 November 2005"," Nothing like Platoon
","Spoiler - NOTHING HAPPENS<br/><br/>Spending two hours watching a cast of characters with no likability is torture. Every soldier there is excessively crude from the beginning and lacks any identifiable traits a moviegoer can relate to (save one guy who has a kid...wow). So, when characters crackup or die there is no reason to feel remorseful. That's part of the problem with the characters; the other part is the lack of back-stories for each character. Platoon and Full Metal Jacket had back-stories, why didn't Jarhead? Jarhead spent so much time beating the audience over the head with how the soldiers spent their waiting moments, which could have been time spent on back-stories. One thinks spending four months in a desert one would talk about each others lives other then who they have banged. Back-stories would have given depth to shallow characters who act retarded for the sake of being retarded and might have given audiences a reason to care if one dies or crackup.<br/><br/>Many of Jarheads moments seemed silly. For instance, the sergeant said he passed on a $100k salary working with his brother, and having a family so he could see ""cool sh*t like this"" -- a burning oilfield. WOW! What idiot passes on a life of peace and happiness so he can see a pillar of fire? One would think the sergeant would say something redeemable like protecting others so they might have peace. Instead, the audience gets a dumb explanation for joining the army.<br/><br/>The acting performances were pretty good and weren't Jarheads problem. I liked Jake Gyllenhaal from Donnie Darko and thought he did what he could in Jarhead. The other actors did okay, nothing that will ever stand out. Jamie Foxx continues to suck after getting lucky in Ray and continues his quest to copycat Denzel Washington.<br/><br/>How anyone compares this to either Platoon or Full Metal Jacket is beyond me. Platoon concerns the Vietnam War which is significantly more severe then some idiots in a desert complaining about not killing. Platoon's premise is the effects soldiers have after killing, which exemplifies the meaninglessness of war; whereas Jarhead says the same effects will happen from doing nothing. I am no student of psychology nor have I been in the army, but killing children and villagers (Platoon) cannot have the same effect as spending four months in a desert (Jarhead).<br/><br/>Jarhead deserved nothing close to a 7.3 and if you, the reader, value your money then rent Platoon instead. You don't need to sit through a two hour movie to realize there wasn't much combat in Desert Storm."

","Did you ever get the feeling that Hollywood has just been rehashing and updating the same movie over and over again? Well Jarhead proves it. For all the people that have called this a modern day Full Metal Jacket, you are right. Very right. Word for word in at least five parts this movie ""borrowed"" lines from FMJ. I mean seriously, is this their idea of paying homage to one of the best war movies ever made, by ripping it off? Maybe Swofford never thought it would get turned into a movie so he didn't mind plagiarizing in his book, thinking no one would ever see it. Or maybe just maybe its a sign that filmmakers are scared. They are scared to try new and exciting ideas or stories. I'm not saying all of them, but the majority would rather just repackage old films and hope to god that we have never seen them before, so you wont catch their lack of creativity, which this movie has pouring out of its butt. Don't waste your time. Watch FMJ instead, at least its ideas were original."

But after half an hour I felt nostalgic for that old classic. This film was nowhere near as good. I seriously doubt indiscipline is this bad in the USMC. A lot more of them would get killed by accident. Or by their own side. The firing the guns into the air to the rap party backdrop was pure hokum. Why was knobhead (sorry jarhead )shown as being a Camus reader for all of five minutes, and then later shown to be a total moron for the rest of the film ? Sci Fi is accused of being all Science and with thin character development. This was a supposedly factual film, but despite that had 2D characters that were worthy of the worst Sci Fi. By the end I didn't care if any of them lived or died they were so irritating and boring."

","Let me start by saying that I have seen tons of war movies and not only have I served in the army but I also have friends who were marines. I have never seen or heard in my life, the amount of profanity in all my experiences, as I witnessed from this movie. I was so repulsed by this bit of tripe that I finally brought myself to leaving a comment on IMDb. (I have resisted saying anything for years on all the movies I have seen). And no, I'm not some religious type either. Its amazing how many people can witness a movie that has the ""f"" word mentioned either every one or two sentences and call that ""realistic"". It begs the question as to what kind of environment they actually live in? The storyline is thin to say the least. The ""sh**"" that they pull on each other (this is what the sniper instructor Foxx calls their roughhousing prank-playing anyways) is also quite over the top - to put it mildly. I am not saying that this does not happen, but come on, give me a break. The fact that no real combat even occurred, means that the story line had to convey each character and that was the main focus. I still do not know the ""Swofford"" character. The director needs to get some pointers from the movie the ""Thin Red Line"", honestly. It seems the only thing that one can take from this movie is a lot of crude behavior and vulgarity. And the fact that a soldier's hands never forgets his rifle. The main point of this movie could have been conveyed in about 10mins. Save your money and give this one a miss."

","Jarhead is by far the worst war film I have seen. I kept waiting for something to happen. If there are to be peaks and valleys in a storyline, this one was a flat line. The story didn't move, never went anywhere. Finally when something might happen, the sniper scene in the tower, it becomes a mind game again. I understand in real war that there is a lot of waiting for something to happen, but do we need to see this on film? If the director wanted to make a documentary he should have done that instead. What a waste of talent as the acting, editing and cinematography were superb. There are great film versions of Vietnam and WWII, this is NOT the film that will encapsulate the Gulf War. I actually found the short documentary on the DVD ""Men of War"" more interesting than the movie. Save your time on this one and wait for a real movie of the Gulf War to come out."

Beautifully shot, great contrasts and use of colour. The acting is great too, with no weak links. Gyllenhaal seems to have a great future of acting ahead of him, and Foxx was great as usual.<br/><br/>If every big war get's a great movie, I'd say this is the one for Gulf I. Unlike ""Three Kings"", which was more adventure-ish, this movie focuses on the soldiers and the stress they get from not getting to do, well, anything. As I've said, Gyllenhaal shows this in a very realistic way.<br/><br/>10/10 In my opinion, everybody should be able to enjoy this movie, no matter what you thought of the war.

","Sam Mendes has done exactly what needed to be done with Anthony Swofford's personal memoir of the first Bush gulf war - he brought it to life honestly, with minimal embellishment, and with captivating artistry. A second viewing will be required for me, and I suspect that my rating will improve after I see it again. Mendes directing, and the straightforward script, combine to make what could have been a trial by tedium, brisk and entertaining.<br/><br/>Swoff is a fairly typical young man - naive yet not idealistic, self-centered and myopic but not really closed to the world around him, sometimes arrogant yet not really rebellious - who has enlisted to serve in the first Bush gulf war. He's not really gung-ho about anything in particular, but nevertheless, manages to experience both the war and his preparation for it as a series of disappointments, protracted fits of boredom, and an exercise in humiliation and futility. The film is presented apolitically, and politics will only interfere with your experience of the film to the extent that you let it. As somebody who supported the first Bush gulf war, though not our stated reasons for launching it, I very much appreciated the insider view this film offered.<br/><br/>The personalities in it are so vivid (some cross the boundary into stereotypes and never come back) that the film sometimes loses focus on its subject in order to comment upon individual people within the protagonist's very narrow field of view. Given the myopic character of the work from which this is derived, and the intense subjectivity of the approach, this turns out to be a strength of the film - making it truly original for its genre. this is no ""war film"" as the genre stands today, but rather, one of the first of what will likely be a postmodern redefinition of the war film genre - focusing reflexively on the practice of warfare as experienced by those who were actually there. An older, less polished, film that I particularly liked, but which seems to have been largely ignored comes to mind - ""Heroes"".<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal plays Swoff well, but for me, the supporting cast really made this film. I see this cast as an ensemble. To a man, the performances were flat-out exceptional. As with most of Mendes' work, the film is also visually stunning.<br/><br/>Recommended, strongly."

","I work in show business on a popular network television show. I graduated from Marine Officer Candidate School in 2001. My best friend recently finished his service in the USMC. My father fought in World War II as a Marine. The Marine Corps is an often regaled, highly respected institution in this country for good cause. However, if my only experience with the Corps was through this movie-- as it will be for countless thousands of people in countries across Europe, the Middle East and Asia-- my sympathy for the terrorists in Iraq and around the world would swell. This is a propaganda film, pure and simple. Jarhead adopts a point of view based on the failure of one Marine and applies it universally to the entire organization. I have experienced the military for myself and the idiocy of the actions undertaken by the Marines from the protagonist's point of view are at best extreme exaggerations and at worst outright lies. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays PFC Tony Swofford, author of the book upon which Jarhead is based. The Marine Corps that ""Swoff"" is a part of is so vilified that his own outlandish reactions to stress seem mere trifles in comparison. But the truth of the matter is that PFC Swofford was clearly not a remarkable Marine. In fact, he was wholly unremarkable. And with a penchant for writing and a few well connected friends, Anthony Swofford's inferiority inspired a 65 million dollar propaganda movie that has the potential to tarnish the wartime reputation of our troops based on a series of mistruths and exaggerations. Swofford was a screw-up-- a trait that is celebrated in this movie when it should be chided. Jarhead hearkens back to the propaganda of World War II, where the Japanese were depicted as inhuman monsters on our posters and Charlie Chaplin bumbled around the screen as the Great Dicatator. The difference of course is that our Marines are the inhuman monsters and instead of Charlie Chaplin presenting a caricature of Hitler, Chris Cooper fills in with a Marine Lieutenant Colonel. Dissenting should be encouraged; and God bless those with the courage to lobby for policy with honesty and integrity. A line of morality is crossed, however, when the Sam Mendes'and the Michael Moore's of society use their influence and wealth to influence millions of people across the world by presenting fiction as fact. This movie is insulting, shameful and enraging. Its November release suggests it will be vying for Oscar nominations. It will damage the image of our troops, it will encourage acts of terrorism against them and any accolades it receives will only validate such damages. If you choose to see this movie, I strongly encourage you to find a Marine and talk to them about the Corps afterward. I also encourage a fiscal boycott of the film; if you are able to attend free or advanced screenings, then power to you. However, if you pay ten dollars to see it, whether you love or hate it, the film's profit margin will increase and the people responsible for the dishonest portrayal within will continue to make copious amounts of money for propagation of untruths."

"Chris Knipp","8","5","9","24 December 2006"," Fine study of the meaninglessness of modern warfare
","Sam Mendes' work as a director hasn't lived up to the temporarily high expectations aroused by his first movie, the 1999 American Beauty. With Kevin Spacey in one of his easiest but most successful roles, American Beauty seemed some kind of classic fin de siÃ¨cle statement of middle-class white rebellion. But like a lot of expressions of a moment, it went stale quickly and over the past six years the rose completely lost its bloom. Mendes movie number two, 2002's Road to Perdition, another filmed graphic novel, was full of visual pizazz but flabby in the storytelling department. It makes sense that when Mendes' adapted Anthony Swofford's eponymous novel into the 2005 Jarhead, people had lowered expectations and didn't see much there. Reviews haven't been very favorable.<br/><br/>And indeed Jarhead isn't the movie of the year. But it's gotten a bum rap from reviewers who have repeatedly said that it starts out in a derivative and conventional manner and winds up disintegrating into formlessness. It's true the Full Metal Jacket drill scene and the barracks sequences early on are sub-Kubrick and even sub-Black Hawk Down. The latter was a horrifically uncritical recreation of a terrible modern battle sequence but it at least has the virtue of precision. In its early sequences establishing Swofford's training and his unit and their mission, Jarhead wavers between the generic and the specific. Again, Mendes isn't outstanding in the conventional storytelling department. There isn't exceptionally good development of a cast of military characters -- you don't get much beyond Gyllenhaal (the narrator), Sarsgaard (his main sidekick and the boil on the bum of the unit) and Jamie Foxx (the platoon commander, an invincible staff sergeant). Chris Cooper looks too sickly and neurotic to be a brigade leader and cheerleader for the whole endlessly delayed war.<br/><br/>There they sit: Operation Desert Shield. The boys at the top have to make some decisions. A hundred thousand and then five hundred thousand men are set down in the sand to sit and hydrate and pee and hydrate and sit some more. They stage combats of desert spiders and they find out their girls have left them for somebody else back home.<br/><br/>This passage is not an outstanding performance despite the steely competence of Foxx and Gyllenhaal's seering musclebound youthful intensity -- which are all good to watch, anyway. It really is just waiting, and waiting is something Beckett was good at, but this ain't Godot.<br/><br/>But the war finally does come. And what matters is that Jarhead is both a very specific description of a new kind of American warfare, seen at the very lowest level of the grunts on the ground -- high tech war, fought with ""precision"" from above, in air strikes so skillful against an enemy so unequal that troops are almost irrelevant -- and something universal but hardly ever so truthfully represented on film: the utter meaninglessness, the sheer insignificance and emptiness of the individual soldier's role in combat.<br/><br/>The latter is something often alluded to, but writers and actors and directors always ruin the point by creating heroes or noble sufferers. In Jarhead nobody's a hero. Nobody even gets to fire a shot or kill anybody. After months and months of waiting, their ""war"" is four days long. They are sent out into a hellish landscape of sooty burning oil wells, a horizon of endless fire and blackness dotted with frozen cinder corpses out of the Dresden of Vonnegot's Mother Night, torsos and limbs of Arabs the marines lay claim to with selfish madness as ""my Arab,"" because their only sense of triumph is the insane one of laying claim to a dead zombie object scattered on a plain. The end of this? Sniper team Sarsgaard and Gyllenhaal get one Arab officer in a tower in their sights and are ready to squeeze the trigger -- and an American officer intervenes to call in an air strike. The boys don't get one single kill -- not even a trigger-squeeze. Dazed and mad and Sarsgaard whining like a baby, they wander over a ridge to find their unit celebrating the end. ""The war's over and you didn't get killed,"" Foxx's staff sergeant declares to them.<br/><br/>There has never been a better or more hallucinatory depiction of the meaninglessness of war than this. And it's also an accurate view of one angle of Operation Desert Storm. Critics have questioned why the movie isn't more comic or more ironic. What can they be thinking of? How could anything be more hideously comic or more deeply ironic than this? I was never in a war but I was in the US Army, and of all war movies I feel this is supremely my war movie. It must be a lot of other guys' war movie besides mine. The war where the grunts are sent out to kill and find only incinerated corpses is the war of the future. Movies need to show us more black bodies frozen like zombies in the sand, because there are going to be a lot more of them.<br/><br/>There's nothing about Gulf War Syndrome. There's nothing about the overall strategies of the war, or the hilarious chaos so brilliantly depicted in David O. Russell's Three Kings -- admittedly a much better, as well as more entertaining, movie than Jarhead. But Three Kings is ironic without really making any profound statement. Jarhead has something universal to say about the powerlessness and insignificance of 95% of all combat soldiers. And it has a very fresh flavor in its final voice-over: we will always be Gulf Warriors. They did nothing; they were geared up and trained for macho hell-raising and mayhem, and they didn't get a single kill. That's because, as Thoreau wrote, ""lo! men have become the tools of their tools."" And when you're the tools of your tools, it's hard to be men any more."
"gluttony14","9","5","9","16 January 2006"," I was surprised for the best
","When I went to watch this movie, I did so reluctantly. I was interested in watching it, though only a bit. Mostly I just went because my friends were going. I was expecting another war movie, a genre I grew tired of. And boy, was I in for a treat.<br/><br/>Jarhead isn't a typical war movie. The difference, which also makes this movie transcend other movies in the genre, is the fact that there isn't much war going on. This movie doesn't focus on the horrors of war, but rather on how the soldiers look forward to the war, how much that waiting and constant training ruins their lives, and how deeply it hurts them that it was all for nothing. They spend more than 150 days in the desert for a 4-day war that ended without them engaging in combat. The main character, Swoff, lost his girlfriend while waiting in the desert. The boredom, the constant anticipation for nothing, nearly cost him his sanity. And all for what? In his own words, he didn't even fire his gun once.<br/><br/>He will forever be a marine, whether he likes to or not. Which is also another point the movie makes - it will be a part of him forever. But I found the subject of what that waiting can do to you, and the disappointment of not doing anything after all that training and waiting and morale, to be more interesting, and more moving.<br/><br/>This is a great movie. It's different from most war movies, and it's far better than most. In this movie, words speak louder than actions. A must-see."
"cderry","2","5","9","14 November 2005"," Unoriginal, inappropriate
","This movie was very unoriginal. The anti-war genre is all about cussing, sex, and showing just how cruel war is. Now, I understand war is hell. But this movie takes the inappropriate parts of war and makes them center stage just for the shock factor.<br/><br/>There was no plot, lesson to be learned, or message.<br/><br/>The only good part of this movie was Jamie Foxx's performance. This movie was a waste of $7.50 and I will not recommend this movie to anyone. I have heard many former marines hate this movie and I can see why. Not only does this movie put marines in the worst possible light, it tries to show that they have no soul and are puppets of the US.<br/><br/>NOT recommended."

Not having been to the desert but did serve in World War One the actions of the crew at play and during action brought back memories for me. I am not to familiar with Jake Gyllenhaal but I think he did an outstanding job in this movie. What can I say about Jamie Foxx, he again gave a terrific performance as he did in Ray. If you want to see a movie that is close to fact, go see this outstanding movie, you will not be sorry. This movie should win some awards when they are given out next year. It is not for everyone, but if you like a good war story go see it."
"SeminolePhenom","8","5","9","7 November 2005"," A third triumph for Sam Mendes
","Anthony Swoofford(Jake Gyllenhaal) tells the story of his experience while fighting in Desert Storm, beginning with boot camp to his training to be scout sniper to his experiences throughout the war and ending with his life after war.<br/><br/>Jarhead probably stuck many as a heat-pounding war-action film and probably left many disappointed. Jarhead is about Desert Storm, a war that had very little action and Mendes stresses this constantly. The movie shows it's share of violence although the movie is more of a war drama such as The Deer Hunter, not Saving Private Ryan. I'm not saying that Jarhead was not entertaining, because it was extremely entertaining witch constant comic relief from Gyllenhaal and Foxx, but it was not the same kind of entertaining that is found in other war movies.<br/><br/>With such an amazing cast of Jake Gyllenhaal, Jamie Foxx, Peter Sarsagard, and Chris Cooper, I was not disappointed with the quality of acting. Jake Gyllenhaal proves to be a great actor more and more with every movie he makes and the same goes for Jamie Foxx. The acting was convincing and flawless whereas the movie held one major flaw. It is only one flaw but it just bothered me intensely. The film was gigantically similar to Full Metal Jacket. It could easily be mistaken for a remake to some. The boot camp scene in the beginning was excessively similar and twice they used the same little chant used in Full Metal Jacket where the troops said ""This is my rifle, there are many like it..."" The themes of Jarhead and Full Metal Jacket were also similar, both saying that ""War takes average men and changes them into heartless killing machines."" Mendes stressed the idea of a marine never being able to change, even after the war.<br/><br/>Besides a similarity flaw, the movie was flawless. For what Jarhead was meant to be, it was perfect. Jarhead will surely be considered one of the best movies of the year and also help bring the war genre back to where it was before The Great Raid. Overall, Jarhead is a great anti-war movie that is quite entertaining but a exceedingly intense at times. Besides being very closely related to Full Metal Jacket, the story is quite clever and original.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film."
"mattesteve","8","5","9","7 November 2005"," an interesting movie with themes as ambiguous as the troops' reason for being there at all
","First off and foremost, this movie is stunning to look at. Sand dunes at night with flames in the background, oil rain, burnt sand all look beautiful in Mendes' third film. But looking at his previous two films we know that he not only has a flair for imagery but also a rather firm grasp on story telling and plot. But Jarhead is different. It is the story of the Desert Shield operation leading up to the short Desert Storm, and it is told from Tony Swoffard's (sp?) point of view. Going into the movie I think my girlfriend and also the couple sitting next to us all thought they were going to see a war movie, and it also happened to have some popular actors and Kanye West music. But I had read the book before hand, and so I already knew that the movie was going to be more about the inaction of their war, their boredom, their insanity, their circus as Swoffard calls it, and less about politics, war, explosions, death, etc. However, that is exactly what the backdrop is. I think my girlfriend finally realized that there was not going to be any spectacular fight scene at the point where Swoffard is sitting on a burnt-out box surrounded by corpses burnt to a crisp and exploded cars, all remnants of the war that he and his marines never got to actually be part of, but were forced to be completely paranoid of. This is a character sketch that alludes to greater themes but never fully exposes them. But this is where I thought the movie worked its true magic. In seems in the recent debates over the current Iraq conflict that the general consensus is that we can ""all agree the first one was justified"", that perhaps the personal stories of the first Gulf War, like Swoffard's, are being glossed over. He makes his point that 350,000+ US troops had similar experiences to him, they were trained to use a gun, to kill, to be a soldier, and now back in the US almost 15 years later they cannot forget it. The acting was top notch, Jake Gyllenhal once again is great, Sarsgard is truly an engrossing character actor, and personally, not sure of his name, but the actor who played Kruger I thought was great! Jamie Foxx is always fun to watch as well. Well worth the trip to the theater if for nothing else but the visuals, but also if you are ready to do a little bit of thinking on your own and decided whether you like what Swofford has to say or not. Done."

","I thoroughly enjoyed this film. As someone who has dated marines, naval officers, and soldiers. I knew what they go through on a daily basis, but it was good to see it in living color. The writing is brilliant. Jamie Fox's delivery is flawless as is Gylllenhaul's. It really put perspective to what happened in Dessert Storm. Nothing, A whole lot and nothing. Don't go to this film expecting lots of action. Because remember that is not what that war was about. It is however a great look at military life and the psychological issues soldiers go through abroad. It's a very appropriate film for this particular time. So I have to give it a lot of stars."

","Weak spoiler, probably shouldn't have put it, but just being safe.<br/><br/>Adervtized as a war movie, this movie has absolutely no war. There is no fighting scenes whatsoever in this movie. The writer/director etc... decided to substitute vulgarity in the highest forms in place of a plot. Look at me, I can be vulgar, use the eff word every other sentence, speak of masturbation, and hey, even show a guy masturbating, wow. THATS GREAT, BUT CAN YOU DEVELOP A DAMN PLOT? This movie simply was not as advertised. In fact, it was not even a movie. A movie is suppose to have a plot, a conclusion, etc... This had none.<br/><br/>Yes, there are movies that are decent that have no plot or conclusion, or development in any form, but they are at least fun to watch, or are true stories. i.e. Blow, which really had a plot, but not a strong one, was at least fun to watch and was a true story.<br/><br/>For those of you who actually liked this film, you are retarded. I am serious, you are probably the same people who keep these late night get rich quick infomercial guys in business. You got meat in your head I tell ya.<br/><br/>What part did you like ? The part where they cussed a lot ? The part where they never actually fought? The part where the lead actor masturbated? WHAT? WHAT THE HELL WAS THERE TO LIKE ABOUT THIS MOVIE ? The only two pieces of the movie that could have salvaged it they just let go by the way side. They could have showed the lead actor and his girlfriend more before he left for duty, and made us feel bad about her leaving him, but noooooooo, that would have actually made this somewhat tolerable to watch. Then they could have had him come home and pistol whip her while he sodomized her new love with his rifle barrel.<br/><br/>Then they could have focused more on the guy that was booted out of the marines and his plight. Maybe a little character development, and again, made us care.<br/><br/>Thats the problem, just didn't care, i could have left the theatre at any time during, and not felt like I was missing something."

","The first time i watched this movie, I passively viewed it and I didn't take to it. Since then I have watched it more than 10 times and learnt to love it. The reason for this is the first time I viewed it I heard hype from peers saying how funny it is and I watched it looking forward to a light-hearted entertainment, however I got something completely different. An enthralling war time film that's beautiful honesty creates a real power house of a story, a plot I would soon come to love.<br/><br/>Swofford (Gyllenhaal) stumbles into the army, young and naive, his ignorance to reality truly captivates the audience as he is dragged threw a treacherous world of propaganda and dark reality. I thought Gyllenhaal's performance was inspiring particularly the scene were he rages at the scared timid Fergus (Gereghty), throwing his gun into the poor boy's face, Swofford's wrath is horrifically intimidating.<br/><br/>As well as Gyllenhaal, Foxx delivers a typically immense display. His character's humour and confidence always makes me laugh (his great speeches are written and performed to perfection). Along with Fitch, Troy and Kruger (my personal favourite) all the performances are solid.<br/><br/>The story is not written to impress audiences with shoot-outs and huge battles, but has been written to identify reality from fiction. The waiting is the key element, as it shows that boredom is worse than combat itself. Also the harsh treatment and seemingly pointless routines also add to the dim view of the war. The ending is (in my eyes) amazing, as the impact of the war hits home and always stays with the marines. I must also mention the musical score which is phenomenal.<br/><br/>To conclude this film will make laugh, angry but mostly it will help you to understand the life of a marine."
"mOVIemAN56","9","4","7","10 May 2007"," Disturbingly accurate and realistic
","Most war films of today are constant action. Battle after battle with every main character surviving and celebrating after making tons of kills in combat. This is the common look at war by today's standards of war from the past 100 years. All action and nothing else. Jarhead takes this myth and flushes it down the toilet and tells everyone how it truly was and shows us all war is hell without the use of combat or amazing special effects.<br/><br/>The film follows a platoon as they enlist in the army and head off to participate in Operation Desert Shield and eventually Operation Desert Storm. Most enter thinking they are going to get that big kill and have the time of their life in Iraq. What they don't count on is censorship of views from the military, 100+ degree heat, and overall boredom. They all simply sit around under constant watch from Staff Sergeant Sykes as they wait for combat that they begin to believe will never come.<br/><br/>What Jarhead does that so many other films don't is show what war is actually like. It gives a viewer a believable look. Instead of landing in Iraq and the very next day gunfire erupts, it is landing in Iraq and waiting and waiting and waiting. This is not a bad thing if you are thinking that. It shows us the life of a Marine during this waiting period. What he does to pass the time, the sense of brotherhood between the men, and the lack of seriousness from some of the more carefree recruits. <br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal delivers, in my opinion, the best and most believable performance of his career as the lead character Swofford, the newest to the platoon and the one looking for the kill he wants so badly to have. He acts normal. He isn't some amazing hero or sophisticated soldier who is smarter and more understanding then the rest. He has his faults, he has a personality, he has a view on war and on life. He isn't some brain dead soldier who acts as if they are on a walk on the beach when war is going on like other movies make leads out to be in war. <br/><br/>Peter Sarsgaard delivers a strong supporting actor job as Troy, Swofford's good friend and spotter (Swofford is a sniper). Like Gyllenhall, he delivers a believable and strong performance as a Marine in the Persian Gulf War. He's more of the understanding kind of soldier but still he has his faults. He is just a believable soldier who has a bit of a chip on his shoulder and understands a little more of what is going on then the rest. Many could say this is a typical kind of character found in a war, the understanding man who tells everyone off. Well I say to them that just because this kind of character is found in every film following war doesn't mean there aren't any in real life (Jarhead is based on fact too, Swofford wrote the book).<br/><br/>Jarhead toys with the audience a lot in the view on the war. Going off to war seems like such an exciting time for the troops when news comes. They watch old war films about Vietnam and celebrate and dance and just screw around. We are made to believe the war is going to be a cake walk with no casualties and just a good old time for the troops. The second half of the film flips the view completely with the reality of bombardment from enemy mortars, walking through the burning oil fields, and coming across the countless civilian casualties sustained during the war. It's reverse psychology at its best. It makes us believe one way with one support for it and then changes are view completely with a hundred arguments against it.<br/><br/>I have very few complaints on this movie. The language is very very heavy but that is to be expected. It's war, all the soldiers are barely 20, and they are all trying to sound cool and tough in front of everyone else. The film shows us the true brotherhood of the military, particularly the Marines. We see some of the practices and initiations of a platoon and views on officers and war in general. This is far by the strongest part of the film with all the in depth look at the Marines during Operation Desert Shield and Storm.<br/><br/>Overall, Jarhead is disturbingly realistic. It isn't constant battle and carnage. It is the war being fought in one's mind. How a man handle's himself when looking upon a charred corpse. How a man reacts when a girl friend breaks up with them in the middle of war. It takes a more human look at war which hasn't been done since Gallipoli was released back in 1981. It is filled with strong sexual references, heavy language and isn't for anyone under 16. However, anyone over that age will love a great film on the human mind during warfare.<br/><br/>4.5/5 Stars"
"Bigbang","4","4","7","28 January 2007"," The Gulf War: A Comedy
","This can't be how Marines act or we would have lost every war. This is how sheltered Hollywood people like Sam Mendes see our military though; like over-the-top obnoxious clowns who can barely string three words together or shoot a gun. Also I wouldn't be surprised if Mendes or the original writer of this book were gay, because way too many scenes had these guys dancing around naked and pretending to screw each other. Never have I've seen guys act this way. Not even gay guys. But this is how Hollywood feminine men like to see guys act. The most awful example is when Jake Gyllenhaal is dancing around like a fool wearing nothing but a Santa hat.<br/><br/>The music in the background was way out of place. How can I take a movie seriously when they start playing C&C Music Factory's ""Everybody Sweat""? I felt like I was watching an MTV reality show.<br/><br/>There were some good moments in Jarhead, and some decent acting here and there, but as soon as it started to get good, the movie would break into comedy again. Just trying too hard to be funny or absurd. The superior Full Metal Jacket, which Jarhead tried to be like, took the natural absurdity and humor embedded in war and let it speak for itself. This movie instead forces it on you. It really is in an insult to everyone involved to turn war, death and destruction into a comedy unless it's done right. Gyllenhaal's problem with his unfaithful girlfriend was also not handled correctly. This was the seed that caused him to begin to lose his sanity. However the transformation is not well done or convincing. Actually the whole movie is just a mish-mash of points trying to be made that are never really made. It's just one big mess."
"greenforest56","3","4","7","4 May 2006"," Poor imitation of 'Apocolypse Now'
","Artistically I think it is very bad imitation of 'Apocalypse Now'. However, I could see how many would like it because of its intensity, drama, and vulgarity. Some may like it because they may think they are getting a taste of 'what it was really like' because of its autobiographical style.<br/><br/>Which brings it to the next problem: Factually Awful. So inaccurate of the United States Marine Corps and the Gulf War I don't even know where to begin. Normally this wouldn't bother me. As an historian I have long accepted Hollywood's version of history is poor at best, terrible at worst. The first thing that usually dies is accuracy sacrificed in the name of drama, which I accept, or the film makers 'point of view' (ideology) which I have more of a problem with.<br/><br/>More and more films from Hollywood treat history as propaganda, as much as Stalin or Hitler used film for the same purpose. The only difference is Hollywood still has to make a profit so they still pay attention to good drama. The bad part is that the majority of people today get their education, not from learned books written according to the highest scholarly standards and subject to peer review, but from Hollywood. Hollywood, who's only two standards are profit and political utility.<br/><br/>'Jarhead' has fallen to these twin demons and portrayed the Marine Corps as populated with a bunch of vulgar, coarse, wanton savages with little discipline or direction from their NCOs, and even less from their officers who are, for the most part, non-existent. One wonders how such a sex crazed mob could fling themselves right into the teeth of an army far larger than they with months to prepare their defense and defeat that army in an astonishing four days. A vulgar mob could not do such a thing, only highly trained & disciplined, proud professional soldiers could do so.<br/><br/>Alas, the average viewer won't think to ask this question."

I've seen many war movies with plenty of atrocities and negative sides of war, but this film truly shows a unique and realistic view of war, that should make anyone reexamine their attitude towards war. I was & still am a supporter of overthrowing Saddam, but despite all the things we hear & see on TV, this film shows a more nuanced psychological perspective on war (albeit the previous one) that we rarely take into account as a society. <br/><br/>Still, the story does not seek to defend either the left or right, or even to change your mind. It just shows things as they are. After seeing this movie, I'm even more convinced that the only people who should be allowed to send a country to war are those who have actually been involved in the painful realities of combat. I highly recommend this movie to everyone, regardless of your political views."
"zor_prime","9","4","7","12 November 2005"," Being a Marine Sniper between Gulf Wars 1 & 2, I wasn't sure if I'd relate...
","I wasn't sure if I'd be able to relate to this movie, which plays out much more like an honest memoir than a war movie. Although some people might have been either shocked or confused by many themes in the film, I would have to say I thought they were accurate. I identified with most all of the thematic elements and I don't think that they were exaggerated for the sake of celluloid. I even found myself laughing (out loud) after a scene or line that I felt to be perfectly funny, though I was apparently the only one in the theater that thought so. Don't take each scene too seriously if you are easily offended--everything in it is pretty right-on, but it's all normal male bonding type stuff. Infantry (and more-so with STA/Sniper) platoons form a pretty close brotherhood where many times there may be no such thing as privacy (which is actually healthy for situations in which team-work is essential).<br/><br/>As a Marine Scout-Sniper in a STA platoon and other units just after Gulf War 1, I was never a shooter in combat. I thought this movie might be past my experiences, but after watching it, I feel that it's a film many people will be able to relate to, not just combat vets (unlike many other more combat-oriented war movies). In fact, it was more like my experience than not.<br/><br/>It's tough to relate any detailed accounts from the film without giving up the very simple and straightforward plot-line. However, I can tell you that it's glancing insight into interpersonal interactions in a unit like STA is an entertaining staple throughout the movie. I say glancing, because I don't think the director had enough time to delve any deeper given that it's less than a 2-hour piece. It's enough to give you a longview of the man's experiences. Take the time to believe the concepts the film presents (because it's a good account of a real experience), and you'll enjoy the whole thing.<br/><br/>Technical: Other than one scene, I thought the events were very technically accurate. There was a scene where a sniper team was in a hide, and are approached and more or less caught off-guard. I wouldn't think any school-trained Marine Sniper would let that happen (without early warning systems or other countermeasures around the hide). Otherwise, all equipment, organizational elements, and armament/ordnance representations were very accurate.<br/><br/>You know a movie's good when it changes your plans afterwards. Instead of going out, I went home to call some friends for Veterans Day! Cheers, Swaff!"

OHH holy stuff, there is not as much actions as some people might have liked, well WELCOME TO THE MILITARY, ALL WE DO IS ""HURRY UP AND WAIT"" What? do u really think we are out fighting 24/7. This is a movie which every MARINE (past or present), Nevy Corpsmen attached to Marines, Army Infantry, and maybe some Airmen and Sailors can relate to it too. To all civilians thinking about joining the Corps thats exactly what it's like. This is not a war movie or a drama, its a DOCUMENTARY about the Marine Corps and the experience of One Marine. I was in the theater with half a company of MERINES and trust me, not one uf us didn't relate to it. Every character in that movie depicts the broad range of people in the Corps. So watch it at u own risk, with an open mind expecting the truth about Todays Marine Corps and nothing else. Marines are a special breed and it takes courage to do what we do, hell to take courage just to sign ur life away no matter what branch of the military u do it in.

","Going into Jarhead I was expecting another ""Saving Private Ryan"" or the similar typical war movie. But I came away from Jarhead perplexed (in a good way), inspired, and moved. A lot of people have decided that they don't like this movie. That this movie is an insult to American Marines and Soldiers. I cannot say for sure that Jarhead doesn't accurately portray what happens to men during war but I can believe where the movie was taking us.<br/><br/>In Jarhead, Swoff and the rest of the troops train intensely and painfully to become tough, trained Marines. The most vivid shots of training in my opinion are 1. ""this is my rifle..."" the scene that showed us the boys becoming part of the war, really part of it and taking those rifles and letting them become part of themselves hit something with me. It seemed as if the boys were turning into machines, and it was informative yet disturbing. And 2. during a crawl through the mud surrounded by live rounds, a Marine is shot accidentally when he can't take it anymore. I felt pain when I watched that scene. Imagining a loved one not even making it out of training alive.<br/><br/>Once in the desert the boys become restless when a few days turns into weeks, months, hundreds of days, without a battle. Gyllenhaal is amazing with his portrayal of Swoff and how the time in the desert affected his mind at times.<br/><br/>For me, the most disturbing part of the entire movie was when the troop came across the burned out caravan of escaping vehicles. I have a deep personal fear of being burned alive. I know the director of Jarhead wanted to hit us at that moment, and it worked. I felt sad and drained trying to comprehend the monstrosities of war.<br/><br/>When the oil fields lit up I have to admit that I was in awe. For such an ugly time it was such a beautiful scene. The oil raining down on the boys and suddenly everything turning black and slick really captured my attention. The horse that Swoff encounters is a reminder of life and beauty and strength in the midst of all that death and destruction.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Swoff was remarkable and although I haven't read the book I am impressed with the way he became crazy, intellectual, reserved, dismissive, and the tried to return to ""normal"" whatever normal could be after all of that.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie and the beauty and devastation is showed.

The director did an amazing job putting on film what really happens during war instead of ""hey lets blow everything up and kill people"". It takes so much of me to say that I love something, I mean I am a very picky person when it comes to movies. Well, I can say I LOVED this movie. The director did an outstanding job with the cast as well. It takes really good talent to do a war movie, and these days good talent is hard to find! The movie was worth seeing. I am glad I paid 7.50 for it! Excellent job!!"

","This movie was amazing.<br/><br/>On the way to the theater, my girlfriend was telling me it received bad reviews [2 stars out of 5?].

The book tends to describe the deeper parts with more depth, as there is a lot more to the field f***ing scene, among others. But thats where the movie rocks...its not afraid to show off, and there are some pretty shocking scenes. The visuals are very impressive, and it is hard to believe that this film was shot in our own states, not in Iraq. The scenery can be beautiful at times too.<br/><br/>As my title states, this movie follows the life of one STA marine through his time joining to his time leaving.

"dnkim64","10","3","5","1 April 2011"," A war film without the war.
","---------------SPOILER ALERT------------<br/><br/>War. The very word instantly summons to mind the vision of explosions, gunfire, and death. When we think of the word ""war"", a plethora of famed movie classics come to mind - Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, or even Lord of the Rings. Again and again, it seems that film makers and producers are finding new ways to make man's worst habit into the neighborhood's best blockbuster.<br/><br/>Now imagine a war film without any bullets or explosions. Jarhead is a war movie that takes the word ""war"" to a whole new level.<br/><br/>Jarhead is a war film that follows Marine sniper Anthony Swofford through his experience as just another grunt in The Gulf War of 1991. Unlike typical war films, ""Jarhead"" sheds true light on any soldier's time overseas. Stationed for four months in the Persian Gulf's 112 degree desert, Swofford does not wake up to explosions and gunfire but rather, the torment of boredom and heat. <br/><br/>In a scene depicting this misery, Swofford narrates, ""Suggested techniques for the marine to use in the avoidance of boredom and loneliness: masturbate. Rereading of letters. Further masturbation. Cleaning your rifle. Arguing about religion and the meaning of life. Further masturbation. "" This statement holds true as majority of the 123 minute long movie are scenes focused on the marines patrolling an endless empty desert, lounging about their camp, and training with false hope of combat. <br/><br/>Throughout the film, Swofford experiences historical events of the Gulf War: The Highway of Death, deployment of Operation Desert Shield, and commencement of Operation Desert Storm. Despite, Swofford and his platoon of borderline-psychotic snipers are cheated their anticipation for combat. <br/><br/>The climax of this movie comes towards the end: Swofford and his best friend/sniper spotter are assigned to assassinate two Iraqi officers. Allow me to vividly describe this scene: Music is not playing and all that is audible is the beating of Swofford's heart. He has the torso of the officer in his cross hair and is ready to fulfill his commitment to kill. Mere milliseconds from pulling the trigger, a squad of marines and a superior officer barge into the room and instruct the eager snipers that they are forbidden from taking the shot. Dismayed and frustrated, Troy (Swofford's spotter) lashes out in a rage of tears and anguish. All they've desired - all they've yearned for - was a single kill, to make all four months of boredom and torment worth while. <br/><br/>Despite being Swofford's best friend and military partner, even Troy has skeletons of his own. After discovering a falsity in Troy's paperwork (unmentioned criminal record), Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx) informs Swofford to assure Troy stays in check. Relating from an earlier scene, the gang of Marines joyously force Troy down and brand him with a ""USMC"" hot iron. Near the beginning of the movie, Troy states to Swofford that a branding must be earned by honor and commemoration, thus permanently denoting the individual as forever loyal to the corps. This just goes to show that everyone – not just Swofford – has a story of their own.<br/><br/>Another noticeable quotation is the closing narration, ""A story. A man fires a rifle for many years. and he goes to war. And afterwards he comes home, and he sees that whatever else he may do with his life - build a house, love a woman, change his son's diaper - he will always remain a jarhead. And all the jarheads killing and dying, they will always be me. We are still in the desert."" This quotation is Swofford's prediction on how he may live out the rest of his life – scarred by the memories and experiences he endured in that desert – he will always be lost in the desert. No matter what he may do in life, his hands will always bear the taint of a rifle.<br/><br/>From a historical and military stand point, Jarhead stands to exemplify how obsolete the foot soldier has become. With advances in aviation and surface warfare, Troy states, ""This war's gonna move too fast for us. We can shoot a thousand yards. To go that far in Vietnam it took a week; in WWI, a year; here, it's gonna take about ten seconds. By the time we have our rifles dialed, the war is gonna be a mile down the road!"" This further shows not only the obvious frustration of the soldiers, but the hard truth that the marines – who so prayed for war – may never even fire their rifles.<br/><br/>Unlike classic war films that tells the events of a nation, ""Jarhead"" tells the events of Anthony Swofford. It focuses not on the War in the Persian Gulf, but the personal war struggling within the mind of a single soldier. Believe it or not, Jarhead is based on the best selling 2003 memoir Jarhead by Anthony Swofford himself. All events and scenes are based on real life experiences of this young corporal.<br/><br/>This is a very black and white film. It does not have a ""grey"" area. Audiences will either absolutely love it, or absolutely hate it. After the movie is finished, no further pondering is required. The plot is very simple and linear. If you're looking for another classic war film filled with gunfire and explosions, Jarhead will surely disappoint. However, if you're looking for something a little moreliteral, then Jarhead is a must-watch. As stated, Jarhead lets you experience war through the eyes of an average soldier – not a hero, nor action star – but just another grunt. It sheds truth on exactly how unwarlike war can be."
"josevcutts","1","3","5","5 August 2009"," Very poor by comparison
","This film is terrible because it really builds the feeling that combat is going to happen, then tells you combat is for the weak, even though it never happens - these people never engaged, so how can this be a commentary? All those war films about guys who got into, and either lived or died horribly - on both sides - fighting against stuff they didn't understand, told us all about the futility of war for the soldier on the ground. But this is just the story of some guy using wars as a vehicle to promote himself. To hell with his sentimental feelings about feeling abashed about not being part of it, that doesn't make him worthy of a story.<br/><br/>If you want an anti-war story you show the stupidity and humility of both sides, not the drama-less humdrum of someone who wished for more.<br/><br/>I have no idea - I've never been in a war, but neither were these guys. They got as close as me. Perhaps they were close on a geographic scale, but they only suffered the same hardships I did in military school. I was smart enough to join when there was no war on, and to be truthful, my military school was a lot lot tougher than here with far more drama, but no one needed to make a film out of it because it was still too banal."

","The debacle war themed film ""Jarhead"" is monotonis and without meaning. What could have been a nice film about the meaning of war, is destroyed in its decision to make the marines look meaningless. And in the end, making a story that resides into nothing.<br/><br/>Set in the early 1990's, during the war of desert storm. A young 20-year old private named Anthony Swofford is shipped out with a group of marines.<br/><br/>Carrying a story that has little meaning. ""Jarhead"" takes away the fighting and violence of war. To tell the story of what marines lives are like without the firing of the weapons. With unique story, ""Jarhead"" destroys it.<br/><br/>Having characters that have no care about fighting for there country, instead, wanting nothing more then to kill and kill again. The story drags and becomes as boring to a fault, while everyone walks aimlessly threw the Arab desert soaking in the boredom.<br/><br/>There is no emotional real emotional story to ""Jarhead"", and what emotion or care that these characters have is thrown to the waist side. As it does nothing to draw the viewer in, making its point clear that these aren't groups of brave people that are willing to die and fight for there country. They are all hicks, potheads, and the fodder of society that have nothing to live for anyway. Making all of those that fight in wars look like mindless rednecks that have a want to kill.<br/><br/>Even the special effect, of what there are, look fakes and weak. While these mindless soldier are running around wondering where to fire there weapon.<br/><br/>And when the war ends, and everyone can return to there families. All these people care about is there regret of not being able to kill anyone.<br/><br/>""Jarhead"" makes no means to give the viewer a story, or a look at what war is in any form. And in the end makes a story that becomes as meaningless as possible. There is no powerful story, no meaningfull emotional conflict, and no point to soak in the monotonis boredom that comes from this empty will that shows a story that tell nothing."

They are now held up as as innocents exploited by America.<br/><br/>Maybe they're afraid that one of them will place a bomb in their autos.

"lisa-432","2","3","5","10 March 2006"," 'Welcome to The Suck'...yeah, no kidding.
","I have to admit I was really pumped to see this film: the trailer was strong, the score was powerful and inspiring, the cinematography was gorgeous; it was a perfect set up for a satisfying kind of war film experience.<br/><br/>So...what the hell? Being the wife of a Desert Storm vet (Navy-- go Bunker Hill), I was interested in getting someone else's perspective of the war, and I'd have to say that if my husband told me a story as boring and as impossibly inaccurate as this one, I would have thought that he went AWOL before he was shipped off and just made it up from there.<br/><br/>And even THAT would have been a better story than this.<br/><br/>So we have a very clever point of view meet-and-greet with Anthony Swofford and get an appropriately small idea of why he joined the Marines (and due to what he's come from I don't blame him).<br/><br/>We follow him through boot-camp (in which the style and build up screams Full Metal Jacket, but unfortunately without the stylistic intensity and wit of R. Lee Ermey), and hop into the war, and that, my friends, is where you are truly experiencing The Suck.<br/><br/>***SPOILER ALERT*** These guys spend 98% of their time babysitting sand, the other 2% shaking their asses at each other or faking orgies to embarrass their Staff Sgt. And while I have NO problem appreciating exactly how effective boot camp exercise is on the male body, I have a hard time believing that they wouldn't get shot for frat-boy behavior in a wartime situation.<br/><br/>Oh and Marine officers don't preform 'blue' stand-up: like a roomful of shouting Marines ""makes his d*** wiggle"". That kind of comedy you get from the drill instructors NOT high ranking officers.<br/><br/>Anyway, in the war film tradition you have: conflict with those in charge, one or two comrades around you, as well as conflicts in adapting to the foreign environment and...well...a bit of shooting of the bad guys here and there, topped off with a coming-of-age perspective. Now I understand that it was a new idea to have a war film where they are nowhere near shooting range of the enemy, and to highlight Swofford's frustration considering they've all been wound up to kill something since they entered boot camp, but does the audience REALLY need to be dragged through it too? And even that might have been bearable if I felt that Swofford had come out of it a changed man--he seems as emotionally dead and lost at the end as he was in the beginning.<br/><br/>What, the whole message of the film was 'Never get your hopes up?' or 'You can't always get what you want?' People can get that message loud and clear everyday at any drive thru, so when you're talking about war something way more profound than that needs to come across before the final credits roll.<br/><br/>***END Of SPOILER*** But I will say that the 'video from home' scene was a brilliant surprise.<br/><br/>Personally I find the whole thing offensive to the honor of The Corps. Marines always, always, always embody the strength, sacrifice and Don't Tread On Me pride of the US in reality as well as in film. They are in there to make the enemy ""come correct"". That's why they're first in and last out in the real world. When you want areas guarded you call the Army, when you want s*** handled you call the Marines. That's what they love, that's why they're there and that's why they're the basis of war films. To show them without this kind of power or at least an attempt to grab it kills their entire legendary essence in that moment. And while I'll never lose respect for them as a force, I hate the idea of a film presenting them as though they didn't deserve to be called heroes or that they're egomanical frauds.<br/><br/>I will give credit to Sam Mendes for his fabulous eye--the scope of the desert was phenomenal; the main actors were perfect choices: Jake Gyllenhaal gives us some very realistic moments of rage; I thought Jamie Foxx was under-used as a our Marine Lifer but had right attitude for it.<br/><br/>Basically, if you want to develop the 1000-yard stare this is a great starting point."

"Quinoa1984","8","3","5","17 November 2005"," a movie, like it's lead character, in inner conflict
","I can't deny that Sam Mendes's new film Jarhead has some power to it- that he and his director of photography (Roger Deakins) create some immensely evocative images, or that there isn't a little thought stirring around within the context of the story and premise. But my problem with it was in something that has kept other war films of years past afloat (though this time more a film about the Marines than any sort of 'war')- there's some sense of emotional connection with the characters. There's something sort of, well, empty at times with the film's situations and details and characters. I can't say either that 'not a lot happens', because in the sense of it being a character study there is...though on the other hand, there isn't. It's like there is a great film stirring around inside of the film's core, but Mendes is more often than not here going for amazement with the lens as opposed with characters that one can really care about. I'm not saying others won't, in a way it has the makings of a true 'cult' movie (not unlike one of its main influences, Full Metal Jacket- almost disgustingly so). On the one hand I think that things like atmosphere, composition, style especially in some bursts (there is one scene where the soldiers come upon a 'burnt' scene that is the most staggering in the film, maybe the best overall), maybe even Oscar-worthy. However, from a director who's past two films were far more engaging on their stories and characters, this is a bit disappointing.<br/><br/>As I said, I didn't dislike the film, in fact at times some of the acting tried to suffice (and sometimes not). Jake Gyllenhaal's Anthony ""Swoff"" Swofford is a performance of some brilliance, if some over-doing. He's come a bit of ways since his Donnie Darko days, though one wishes that he could tap a little more into Swoff, with his Camus fascination and its projection onto the arid, boring desert life of Saudi Arabia. Stellan Saarsgard as his 'friend' Troy, a fellow 'bad-ass' kind of Marine, gives maybe the better of the performances of the main crop, adding a certain tenderness (or vulnerability) to the part, behind his mostly rough exterior. Jamie Foxx plays himself, only with a Sergeant frame of mind this time. And there is an assortment of supporting players rounding up the lot, with a mix that ranges from being fascinating to odd to downright conventional. There are times when the actors do try and make things entertaining, and it is (the ""interviews"" sequence is funny, if again a FMJ take-off). It's just the 'heavy-ness' that gets it down in the end. I would see this movie again, and I was glad I saw it, but I can't recommend it as highly as I wish I could."

","A war movie without war - brilliantly brought to the screen. Amazing how you slowly come to grips, just like the characters do, that all this is going to be anti-climactic - none of what they went thru is going to matter in the least. This is brought home in the final scene where they return home and they get the 1st glimpse of what the brotherhood of being a marine means when a Vietnam vet ""crashes"" their parade and comes on board the bus and asks to sit with them. They look at him like he is crazy and he looks at them like they are long lost relatives. He gets to live vicariously through them the feeling of what getting an actual parade for returning soldiers is like and the returning marines see what actual marines who went thru the horrors of war turn out like. Ultimately, its a vision into the future what they will feel about each other and the next generation of marines as the years pass. Before this time, they had been seeing their experience as individuals - to some degee this is their final lesson in becoming a marine. In a way - this is the MAIN theme of the movie..its not about the characters, its not about war, its about being a marine and once a marine always a marine...<br/><br/>""We are still out there in that desert""....<br/><br/>""No matter what you may do with the rest of your life, your hands never forget the feeling of holding that rifle""."

","Excellent movie.<br/><br/>I spent five years in the Marine Corps. I never went to war, but when I was stationed in Japan we had a wary eye fixed on North Korea. It was constantly beat into our heads that the war could come, and probably would come, very soon and without warning.<br/><br/>Put people in this situation, and things like Jarhead depicts do happen. Training people to kill and telling them they probably will get a chance to very soon will warp their minds. This isn't bad, or good... it's just the way it is. Normal people just aren't capable of warfare.<br/><br/>We never actually deployed, so things didn't quite rise to that level, but they definitely moved in that direction. And when warning signs got a little harier... or there was an incident along the DMZ... the pre-war insanity went up a notch.<br/><br/>Not every Marine or Marine unit will respond to the pressures of impending combat the same way. Individual personalities, unit cultures, assigned missions, will all work together to shape a different response. But the response of these Marines to the impending war is completely believable."

","This film draws more upon character build up than it does the story of war itself. If you enjoy identifying with a protagonist then you will enjoy this film. Also, I found it was visually stimulating, many of the shots were absolutely brilliant. At no point did I feel disturbed by some of the grotesque images i was seeing, but in fact could appreciate the cinematography and direction of those shots. Everything was beautiful, even the pain and darkness of the film. Don't walk into the theater expecting an edge-of-your-seat-thriller. I think that many people who do this will be disappointed. Approach it as reality, an accurate reflection of one man's experience, not a glorified view of wars. Also, it is important to really embrace Sam Mendes' style of editing. You will notice that he places a lot of emphasis on the long shot and mise en scene."
"cdwollan","9","3","5","8 November 2005"," The movie portrays the viewpoint of the soldier in modern combat
","I liked 'Jarhead' because it was a very good description of the soldier in the gulf war. Based on a true story, it portrays the traditional ground soldier as feeling unnecessary in the modern blitz tactics that our military employs. Another great point of the movie is that no matter what anybody does with the rest of their lives, they always have their unique experiences in the military as major, unforgettable events in their lives. It shows the good and the bad. It gives many different (and contrasting) points of view of the soldiers actually fighting and dying. Many expect another 'Blackhawk Down' or 'Saving Private Ryan' but it is not that. It is a real experience of men during the first gulf war and is an important movie to watch. Beware, it's mostly talking and not shooting. All in all, it was a refreshing movie that gave the realities of war that did not use elaborate fight scenes to keep the viewers occupied."
"phantomverse8","9","3","5","8 November 2005"," A year for auteurs
","Shyamalan claims that this is the worst year for film quality, and he may be correct, but it is also a year of directorial triumph. Haggis debuted with the startlingly contemplative ""blame everyone by blaming no one"" Crash, Foster gave us Stay, Chow did Kung-Fu Hustle, Cronenberg captured small-town secrets, Lucas finished his saga, and Ron Howard went under-appreciated. Now Sam Mendes adds this appropriately subdued power-house complete with stunning imagery, courageous casting, and timely discourse. Jake has gotten lots of buzz for his performance but it will be buried beneath Joaquin's Johnny and Viggo Mortensen's schizophrenia; still there is enough here to quiet his naysayers. Perhaps what I am struck by most is what William Broyles Jr. does not say in this script. How simply and succinctly he omits certain dialogue and lets the intense cast and ridiculous scenery tell the audience all that it has to know. There is so much to say in a movie like this, and whatever isn't screamed is whispered beneath AK shots, loud music, escapism testosterone and genuine emotion."
"robert-jacques","8","3","5","8 November 2005"," 'Gritty', yet 'dreamy' take on the effects war
","Solid performances by Fox (enjoyble to watch as a marine-lifer)and Gyllenhaal make 'Jarhead' a worthwhile time at the theatre. Mendes's film made me recall many tales of war, yet puts a completely new spin on this genre. At times I felt as if he was paying homage to such films as 'Fullmetal Jacket' and 'Platoon' to even a Kurt Vonnegut novel (there are some interesting characters tied with elements of the surreal), however this movie feels differently due to the type of war Operation Dessert Storm was. I feel Mendes perfectly captures the psyche of these soldiers in the type of hurry-up-and-wait marine mentality of this war, by the time Gyllenhaal sees his first and only action we can feel the tension and release when he gets his call to duty. One of the strongest and most realistic aspects of this film is the way the soldiers act in the environment they are in. This movie is very gritty in this aspect, giving one of the most realistic portrayals of a soldier being isolated away from home, from missing girlfriends to going crazy due to the exhaustion of war in general. At times I felt as if this film moved as a documentary due to the dialogue between its characters, it seemed as if they were not working from a script, but real life conversations. I especially liked the dream sequence in which Gyllenhaal misses his girlfriend (he pukes sand as he stares at his girlfriend's reflection in the mirror), you can feel his anxiety of being away from a loved one. This movie is a solid portrayal of what this type of war or any war can have on a soldier's psyche, no soldier is the same after he has held his rifle, this film proves it."

","""I was lucky enough to see an advanced screening of this film last night,"" says almost everyone who posts early comments. But I was lucky. The film was one of the most intense psychological depictions of soldiers during wartime that I have ever seen, and they only go to war for a very short period of time. Many people seem to get caught up in deciding whether or not this movie is anti-war or whether it bashes marines or agrees with oil conspiracy theories, but those kind of arguments draw away from the cinematic achievements here. During parts of this movie I was so drawn in to the psychological elements of a marine during wartime that I forgot who I was and sympathized with the characters more than I ever have in a war movie before. The acting was pretty amazing. Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard were brilliant in their portrayals of the sometimes humorous, sometimes wild, and sometimes on-the-edge of insanity young men who give up their time and, hopefully not, their lives after going through intense and nearly brainwashing training. *Spoiler?* When you see the two scenes where each of them completely breakdown you'll see what I mean. *End of Spoiler* Jamie Foxx also put on an amazing performance as the staff sergeant who has his times of near compassion as well as his times of being a dick. Aside from the acting, Mendes does a pretty great job of showing the intensity with the hand-held camera, although it gets kind of annoying in spots. He also uses lighting very well, as he usually does, to depict some beautiful yet quite disturbing scenes in the desert, especially *SPOILER* The scenes with the oil fields burning. Those scenes were so intense and hauntingly beautiful *END SPOILER* Overall, I'd say see it if you can stomach it, because the brutal reality was sometimes hard for me to deal with.

"cultfilmfan","8","3","5","6 November 2005"," Jarhead
","Jarhead, is based on the book of the same name by Anthony Swofford. The film tells about Anthony's experience as a young man as he was a lance corporal in the United States Marine Corps. He was in the scout/sniper position and was in Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait during the Gulf War. The film shows Anthony's relationship with the other Marines and the sergeants and what they do while they are stationed out there and what they do before they can finally come home. Jarhead, has good direction, a good script, great performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography and good film editing. The film is well made in just about every possible way and it is a very engrossing and compelling film. The film has some very powerful moments, is bold and one of the strongest things about the film are it's characters. The film focuses on several different characters through the film and I found that the characters were all very interesting and we got to get some personality traits here and they were all well played by the actors. Jake Gyllenhall, who plays Anthony Swofford, does a very good job of playing his character through different emotions and situations and one this film's strongest points is it's different characters. The film is about a war but there is no real combat or fighting scenes in this film. Instead of that it's how these characters react to the war, the training and each other. I found this to be more interesting and powerful than if it had long epic battles in the movie. This reminded me of the film The Deer Hunter, because in that film it shows more about the characters than the war also. The other thing that is really good about this movie is it's look and feel from it's great director Sam Mendes. I immediately knew Sam Mendes, would be a great director after I first saw American Beauty, in 1999. It was one of my favourite films of that year and it left quite an impact on me. I then saw his second film Road To Perdition, which I did not like as much as American Beauty, but I thought it was great too. Now, Sam Mendes comes to us with Jarhead, and it is quite a great achievement and I think after only three films so far in his career that he will win many more awards and he is on the path to becoming one of today's best directors. I think some may be disappointed in Jarhead, for not being more faster paced or having the battle scenes but for a powerful film about characters and how they react to war and these situations this is a film for you."
"wcmcctc","7","3","5","6 November 2005"," good, despite lack of story
","the main criticism lobbed at Jarhead has been its lack of story arch. this is true, but despite that, it still held me rapt. Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard were typically good, and even though i haven't read the book, i'd imagine the movie did a good job of capturing Swofford's horror and dark-humor. i'm glad Mendes and Broyles didn't set about artificially creating a story with more conflict. Seven years ago, critics were probably lambasting The Thin Red Line for its nebulous and ill-defined story. TRL, however, is increasingly viewed as a classic. The same might not happen to Jarhead, but this is a movie better than its reviews. Maybe, owing to the cast and crew, as well as the subject matter, people expected too much. The scenes are strong, the preachiness is non-existent, and I wouldn't be surprised to see Gyllenhaal nominated for Best Actor."
"OriginalMovieBuff21","10","3","5","6 November 2005"," A terrific film that blazes with perfection, although rarely any action, the basis of the film delivers us a great note
","Jarhead is based upon marine Anthony Swofford's best selling novel that resembles about his pre-Desert Storm experiences and his experiences fighting in Kuwait. The movie is excellent and it shows a terrific view on Swofford's war experiences, including his training and boot camp experiences. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a masterful performance of Anthony Swofford. His performance is very well done and should be put up for an Oscar nomination. Once again, Jamie Foxx as Sgt Siek and Peter Sarsgaard as Troy also have fantastic performances. The direction by Sam Mendes and the screenplay by William Broyles Jr. mix perfectly as well as the cinematography and music are very good and blend in good with the movie. Jarhead is an excellent movie that doesn't always have to have action to be a successful film, but the basis of the movie about being a marine hits us with a great note.

There were slight attempts to humor, and no heroic scenes AT ALL, military or otherwise. We actually had to leave the theater because of the overdone, graphic, & meaningless cursing and sex trash. This movie represents the cause for declining movie tickets sales. It was riddled with anti-war overtones. To sum it up - SAVE YOUR $$$$, JARHEAD was as 'Swofford' (the main character)characterized ""empty - filled with nothing"".

Secondly, any soldier, especially Marines, should be up in arms as to the conduct portrayed in this movie. My platoon treated the airline crew with respect as American Soldiers should. The action left me wondering whether the author of this novel spent time in combat or sat in a GP Large drinking chilled beverages. There would never have been any foot patrols allowed to be inside the burning oil fields and as far as the ""highway of death"", although depicted very well, such a small patrol would not have had access.

","very very heavily influenced by full metal jacket, this hilarious take on the Persian gulf war of 1991 is entertaining as hell. sam mendes does a great job directing and the actors portray their characters nicely, but the greatness lies in the writing of the movie. not being familiar with the novel i'm not sure how much of the material came from the book directly, though i would suspect most of the narration is taken verbatim. three things that got me beyond the humor was the spectacular visuals towards the end of the film of the oil fields burning. it reminded me of Dante's inferno, or the book of revelations, literally a world falling apart. the second was the awkwardness of hearing music by nirvana in the movie. i don't know if this is the first movie to feature nirvana on the soundtrack, but it's the first i know of, and being a fan of the music, it sounded out of place. the final thing that got to me was the underlying theme of cuckolding. in the movie it insights paranoia and fear out of all. it seems all consuming in the movie. the deer hunter scene almost made me cringe with embarrassment and humiliation at how something like that must be emotionally and spiritually destructive. men tend to be territorial when it comes to the intimacies of their lovers, and in monogamous societies this is accentuated even more by the feelings of exclusivity that comes with pair bonding. in this light nothing could be more destructive to a man than his ""sanctuary"" being invaded. other than all that jazz though the movie was rather entertaining and a good watch, it shifts away from the gritty emotionalism of war movies like platoon and tigerland and stands side by side with kubrick's full metal jacket and catch 22 in the infinite absurdities in and of war.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

So many of us sit at home proselytizing about the meaning of war, but this movie is showing it on a much deeper level- the one confronted by the guys on the ground. It is a character study, and a fascinating one at that, if slightly limited. If one wants to see bombs and fight scenes, this wouldn't do it. However, I laughed out loud more than one time, and then felt disturbed but still humored. This type of reaction to me is good- indicative of a movie that elicits a response.

Swofford signed up because the Marines have been part of his family for generations and Swofford's father served in Vietnam. <br/><br/>Swofford quickly begins to hate the Corps that is until his Staff Sergeant (Jamie Foxx) introduces him to sniper shooting. Swofford is hooked and it seems to be the only thing he was ever good at. His life seems to have purpose. Swofford quickly becomes one of the best and is teamed with his spotter, Troy (Peter Sarsgaard). <br/><br/>Then the war comes and Swofford wants nothing more than to see some action. But it's a different kind of war, a war Swofford may end up battling within himself than with some enemy in some foreign land.<br/><br/>Jarhead reminded me in some of Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" except it was a lot more toned down and it was a film more about the inner-workings of a marine's mind than the shock of Vietnam and the tragedy that gripped Marines in that war. <br/><br/>I do have to admit I loved the way a lot of this film was shot. The photography and attention to detail is brilliant but I wouldn't expect anything less from the director of ""Road to Perdition"".<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the film as a whole is that I couldn't relate to any of the characters in the piece. If you have no military training and have no real desire to do so then how does this film work for you? It just doesn't. <br/><br/>I really tried to relate to the central character but found him so unapproachable even when Jake Gyllenhaal was giving such a wonderful performance. There was no common ground unlike previous characters from other war films like Charlie Sheen in ""Platoon"", Mark Wahlberg in ""Three Kings"" and Martin Sheen in ""Apocalypse Now"". <br/><br/>Maybe it was hard to relate to these characters because for almost 80% of the film they are bored out of their skulls. A bored man with a gun, well, that sounds safe. Are we supposed to feel pity because this man can't destroy another human being's life? I thought not.<br/><br/>You know in some respects the whole film seems like one giant allegory to what is impotence. A man, his gun, his insecurities and his slowing under-developing mind.

Most of the movie the actors were just shown wandering aimlessly around the desert. The special effects were not even very realistic. This movie was an absolute disgrace to all our men in uniform and on top of that it wasn't even a good anti war movie. These marines acted more like draftees from the Vietnam era rather than volunteers.

""Jarhead"" is based on a book written by one Marine, who joined this force due to lack of professional options, since he was not able to go to college. This movie shows the Marine Corp trained by stupid and sadistic leaders, and the troop completely alienated, in a war without seeing the enemy, or knows the country or the costumes of the locals, and even the reasons for their action, being trained like pawns, aiming to kill an enemy. I do not know the reality of the Marines, but the way the story is presented it is not compatible with the worldwide image they have, mostly due to Hollywood movies. I was a little disappointed with director Sam Mendes, after ""American Beauty"" (1999) and ""Road to Perdition"" (2002). With the usual interval of three years to make a movie, he should have selected a better screenplay. My vote is five.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Soldado Anônimo"" (""Anonymous Soldier"")"

","A few weeks prior to watching ""Jarhead"" in its entirety, I saw some clips of it on television and thought that perhaps it would be the ""Rambo"" of our generation. Unfortunately, I was severely disappointed.<br/><br/>Basically (Spoiler Alert), the plot of Jarhead follows a Marine Unit (focusing on one solider played by Jake Gyllenhaal) that is called into active duty during Operation Desert Storm. However, ""action"" is the furthest thing from the minds of the Marines, as they (in the words of their commanding officer) do nothing but ""train, hydrate, train, hydrate some more, and maintain a constant state of suspicious alertness"". Even when the unit does get the opportunity to carry out a designated mission, they are quickly and easily booted aside by the ever-popular air attacks. As the Gulf War ends, the entire unit has not fired a single shot in aggression throughout the entire campaign.<br/><br/>This film did one major thing right, but also seemed to generalize about a number of things that I did not appreciate:<br/><br/>What works is the focus on Gyllenhaal's character and the mind-set the he embodies through the entire process. He is pretty much lost when he enters the Marines, but then goes (in stages) from being utterly confused, to angry for enlisting, to ready to fight, to confused once again about his role in the entire process. Though uncomfortable at times (as we prefer to think of our returning soldiers as no less than out and out heroes), it was interesting to see a sampling of the emotions that likely beset our young men and women serving abroad.<br/><br/>The main reason the film turned me off a bit, though, is the generalization it made about the U.S. military. Sure, I understand that the ground troops may not have been as effective in a war fought out in the desert, but I cannot bring myself to believe that all military life (while not bombing the crap out of something from above) is boring and pointless. The Marines are still an elite combat unit that serves their country to the utmost, and I don't believe for a second that they find their task to be as boring or inane as director Sam Mendes portrays it. It almost seems as if Mendes (although not overly preachy about it, which was good) was using the example of the Gulf War to cast a pall over the entire current military structure/usefulness.<br/><br/>Thus, while Jarhead is a decent film that touches on some uncomfortable social/personal issues surrounding enlistment in the U.S. military, it ultimately fails to live up to my ""next Rambo"" tag due to a few over-generalizations that could very easily be used to unfairly steer audiences into an anti-military frame of mind."

","Jarhead moved me on a personal level since it displays the life of a boy whom enlisted unaware of his future duties, of the wars being fought, and of the consequences it had on all those around them. From the wandering horse to innocent bystanders, everyone is affected (unfortunately for the worst, usually) and Jarhead shows the significant role each person plays despite the overwhelming circumstances. <br/><br/>From the branding to chants, tradition and solidarity is still alive, but what does it stand for? Whether it's people running away from problems, trying to find meaning, living out their dreams or just simply trying to pay bills, every Jarhead has a story that's unique to themselves. Even after their deployment finishes, life never quite returns to its original normalcy. <br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed the camera crew scenes and breakdown of daily routines since it details how average soldiers really are. No one is truly fighting with each others; only secular groups (instigated by those in higher power) and ""appointed"" officials that yield the masses. These people's attitudes are not intrinsic to the person, but rather the situation.<br/><br/>Although the plot wasn't phenomenal nor the peripheral cast great, the overall movie was solid. From beginning to end, we see how the innocent boy we start with is now forever a Jarhead."

","Jarhead, based on the book written by the film's main character, Anthony Swofford. If you're like me then you would've never known that it was a book and probably would've figured it had to be to make up for the weird direction that the movie took early in it's plot. But like I said, it was based on a true story, and based on films that I've seen (We bought a Zoo, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Red tails just to name a few),they all appeared to be taking a weird direction just because the events taking place actually happened and the directors decided to stick with that. We're introduced to The main Character, Anthony Swofford, Swof, or Tony to his ""girlfriend"" and he makes it clear that he isn't really prepared for what the Marine Corps has in store for him, but he does know that his family is riddled with mental illness, loneliness, and sadness, so either way he was going to be fighting a war. My main issue right away with Jarhead was with the Drill Sgt in the first scene, who instead of playing the role of the Drill Sgt that Anthony actually encountered, it seems like he was trying to do his best 80's version impersonation of the staff Sgt from the film Full Metal Jacket. Maybe i'm wrong, but I couldn't help but feel that way. After meeting that Drill Sgt, Swofford comes across Jamie Foxx's Character ,Staff Sgt Sykes,who doesn't really sit well with me in the beginning acting wise. Soon after getting acquainted with the rowdy, friendly members of his platoon, Swofford's battle from home continues as he starts to worry about his girlfriend, Christina, and how she could be cheating on him with a ""Jodie"" as the troops call the other men that could be in the lives of significant others. After numerous days of no activity whatsoever, things start to get to Swofford, such as Christina leaving him, being demoted after a Christmas eve celebration goes wrong, the fact that it's all occurring in the 120 degree heat of the middle east. And as the end of the movie approaches, so does the Chance for Swofford and Troy to get the kill that they've been dreaming of, especially since Troy is set to be discharged from the Marines after it's found that he lied about his criminal record on his Marine Corps application. Scenes like the one involving Troy's reaction to his chance to kill being taken away, and Swofford's (Jake Gyllenhaal) mental mind game/Breakdown against another platoon member, are scenes that I think were delivered the best throughout the entire movie, except for one thing, the fact that the gun position changes whenever Gyllenhaal pulls Fergus off of the rack. other than that the film wasn't too bad on the acting and cinematography side. Jarhead is a movie that I would definitely recommend if people can accept the fact that it was through the eyes of a man that never got the chance to fire his rifle, the same job that he was chosen to do."

","JARHEAD - 8/10.<br/><br/>First of all I'm not a massive fan of war films. Sure I loved Saving Private Ryan and Full Metal Jacket etc. but honestly films like Pearl Harbour and Black Hawk Down have never seemed appealing to me personally, no idea why. The only reason I watched Jarhead was because of a recommendation from a friend and it far exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>This is not an action film. There are bits that have small action elements to them but Jarhead is not full of explosions and gunfights by the minute. If you are a fan of 'high-octane' action films please do not be put off by this. I cannot stress enough how the fact that just because this isn't a fast paced film means that it is boring. Jarhead is far from boring.<br/><br/>The reason I enjoyed it so much is the fact that (possible spoiler ahead) the heroes were not actually heroes; they did not get a big battle at the end and they far from went out with a bang. Even someone who isn't a Jarhead like myself understands that this is the reality of war and I think the writers embrace that. That being said some parts of this film really start to make you think and chances are you will be put out of your comfort zone with some of the emotions you feel during this film because there is such a perfect blend between the comedy and drama, you will feel disturbed, you will feel excited and you will be moved.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, not ground-breaking but Jake Gyllenhaal does a good job at breaking down when he needs to. To summarise Gyllenhaal plays a Jarhead by the (nick)name of Swoff and the film is really a psychological journey through his time in the marines and how he deals with various scenarios - good and bad.<br/><br/>If you, like me are a fan of well-crafted films that make you feel then Jarhead is for you."

","I am not a professional. I watch movies, and share my thoughts about it. I know, I am too young to watch R's, but, so what, in my country (Holland) it's 12+. I had already seen this film at the age of 8. It scared me, and I never wanted to see it again. Until yesterday. I watched the film, and it was such a good story. No heroistic stunts. No Medal of Honors. Just an excellent story, of a soldier, who didn't have the war he had expected. It has been 3 years since The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas made me cry, but this one came really close. The body of Troy was sad, but especially the song, plus the last lines, were really, really beautiful. And I don't know why, but this film really won a place in my heart. Factual (mostly) correct. Good acting work by Gyllenhaal. Almost flawless. Just a underrated movie, I would place it in my top 10. Goosebumps. A 9 out of 10."

"GWilliamLocke","9","2","3","15 August 2010"," A Must-See War Film, Thanks to Roger Deakins
","Director Sam Mendes, the man responsible for modern classics American Beauty and Revolutionary Road, almost always seems to know what he's doing, be it heavy (Road to Perdition) or light (Away We Go). This is why his 2005 war film, Jarhead, is such a disappointment. The concept of the film is great and the cinematography is, at times, as beautiful as you'll see in a war film. But damn, some of the attempts to make the film seem  err  hip, are embarrassing. The incessant use of unfitting, of-its-time music - used as an attempt to keep the movie light and fun - is so blatant and annoying that you can't help but cringe. The playful moments amongst the Marines who make up the story of this film are borderline cheesy. Actually, they're not borderline anything - they're flat out cheese.<br/><br/>This is a shame because, aside from the then-hip casting of lead man Jake Gyllenhaal (at the time a sudden cult figure thanks to Donnie Darko), the casting was great. The writing was great. The production was great. These few small mistakes keep Jarhead from being the best war film of the Naughts.<br/><br/>The story of Jarhead is simple. Our hero, Anthony Swofford (Gyllenhaal in his first major studio lead role), joins the Marines just as Operation Desert Shield is about to hit. He spends a lot of time adjusting and questioning what he's doing, but even more time wondering what his girlfriend is doing back home. (We're made to feel like this girlfriend of his is his everything - amusing, considering the character is 20 years old.) At the urging of Seargent Sykes (Jamie Foxx), Swofford becomes a Marine sniper, which he is very good at. He's he part of an ace team of shooters, paired with the always excellent Peter Sarsgaard, as Cpl. Alan Troy.<br/><br/>The crew of Marines, led in rank by Sykes and spirit by Troy, almost never appear scared. Aside from Skarsgaard, who leads the way as far as acting, Lucas Black (as Chris Kruger) stands out. He's a Texas boy who goes back and forth between airhead and the most reasonable man in his squad. At one point, when the Marines are discussing the point of the war, Kruger puts it straight: ""I know these oil guys; I've been around them all my life. They drink oil like water. This is a war about money; we're here to keep the oil cheap."" No one believes him. Later in the film, when the soldiers are told to sign a waiver and take an untested pill that can supposedly fight the side effects of nuclear weapons, Kruger again stands up, spitting the pill out after fighting with Sykes. These are some of the most memorable scenes, not only because of the subject matter, but because Black (who most know as the young, twangy boy in Sling Blade), is a heck of an actor.<br/><br/>But don't get excited, this isn't an overly political film. There are points made here and there, but, mostly, the film attempts to show what it was like to be a Marine during Operation Desert Shield. The movie moves slow as we watch the Marines sit and wait. They foolishly hope for action as the days pass. There are side stories here and there (watching porn together, sneaking alcohol, accidentally burning up a tent full of explosives, etc.) that remind more of an American Pie movie than Apocalypse, Now.<br/><br/>But that's okay, in a movie this slow, I'm guessing the producers and Mendes knew they'd need some cheap thrills. Personally, I'd rather have the film be shorter and less fluffy, but, when you cast Jake Gyllenhaal, you almost HAVE to bring the fluff. My personal favorite comedy bit, and maybe the only one that works in the entire film, happens when a helicopter flies over the Marines when they're at their lowest point. As the helicopter passes, blaring the Doors song ""Break On Through,"" Swofford looks at the sky and says ""that's Vietnam music; can't we get our own music?"" After about 80 minutes the film starts to pick up. Our crew of Marines are in the 112 degree desert, chasing a group of fire-happy Iraqi soldiers. The way cinematographer Roger Deakins (known mostly for his work on The Shawshank Redemption and every great Coen Brothers film) shoots the desert footage is amazing. I don't want to give anything away, but will say that, between Skarsgaard's powerful performance and Deakins' cinematography, Jarhead is a must-see. Sometimes it feels like a painfully by-the-books war film and at other times it stands alone - thanks to Deakins' amazing eye and mastery of his craft. (Towards the end we get to see some incredible footage of a desert filled with burning oil wells. It's the kind of cinematic imagery film fans dreamt of before all this crazy CGI stuff became so standard. I recall being wide-eyed and out of breath through many of these scenes.) Is there a big bang at the end? Does the suspense and conflict finally come as it does in, well, every war film ever? Well  maybe. Kinda. I don't quite know how to explain it. I will say this: upon it's initial release, the ending made the average movie-goer angry and many cinephile types happy. It's uncompromising and subtle, which is strange when you consider how much, at times, it felt likes Mendes was trying to make an artsy war film for the popcorn crowd. Instead, he ends up with a film that is only a few cheap mistakes away from being a classic.<br/><br/>Jarhead is full of memorable lines, but is best summed up in the final minutes when Swofford says ""every war is different; every war is the same."""

","What makes Jarhead great is that it is a smart story with a great screenplay good acting and has one brilliant soundtrack. Another reason i love Jarhead is that it's not like many of the other American war films to come out recently as this you don't even see a single enemy die and the lead character dosen't kill anyone that is what made this movie stand out to the Black Hawk Downs of this world. I think this film is the Apocalypse Now of the 21st century because they are both powerful movies showing horrors of war and even though apocalypse now is better (just) Jarhead deserves every right to be compared to it. I hope many war films will follow Jarhead and also more movies about the Persian gulf will follow as it reminded me of how horrible it was in that war.<br/><br/>So overall Jarhead is one of the best war films to come out in many years and was just excellent with a fantastic script and a first-rate job by Sam Mendes and once again a incredible soundtrack."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","2","3","12 August 2009"," A cinematic punch to the gut
","I have not read the novel, so I can't comment on whether or not it is a faithful adaptation. This is a dark and bleak look at war, with the brutality of it not being based on violence, blood or gore, which is not abundant in this. Instead, this explores the impact it has on the mind, and it is a truly chilling and devastating story. The plot is well-told, and the similarity to Full Metal Jacket is obvious, without detracting from the viewing(I wouldn't call it ""enjoyment"", and that certainly wasn't what the two directors went for) of either film. I believe this is the first time I've seen something helmed by Mendes, though I have been wanting to watch his work for a long time, and now I definitely will make sure to pursue more of it. The tone is unpleasant, and the experience of this is often suffocating. You feel trapped. This stares you right in the face and never blinks. The acting is excellent all the way. Pacing is impeccable. The cinematography and editing are incredible. I don't know how much of this is accurate and true to life, but it doesn't come off as exaggerated. This is highly psychological, and in that regard, is completely credible. The music is spot-on. While it is frequent, the narration doesn't come off as a crutch. There is near-constant strong language, as well as a bit of sexuality/nudity. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in how a battlefield affects the soldiers. 8/10"
"billion_mucks","7","2","3","19 November 2007"," A Portrait of the War Inside
","Sam Mendes approach at the war in Iraq isn't rancid neither inaccurate. It's lateral. Wheter you expect tons of action or tons of emotions, you will get in between of them. The movie explores the lack of dynamism in the Eastern Front and how the war is liberated by the Phsycological road and the manipulation of fears is of upper relevance.<br/><br/>Performances are visceral and passionate, smart and felt. Jake Gylleenhall does his work in a bloody good manner. Saarsgad brings the spiritual contrast into scene with a cynicism that is largely well acted. Jamie Foxx brings to scene a life style that dominates the front: a life style in which vital is the adrenaline and no matter how much sand, oil or walking in an empty desert may despair, he goes front to his patriotic spirit, with his wit and grown loyalty to his team.<br/><br/>The movie revolves into the idea of what happens between the recruits when there is no action and one has to always be prepared. What goes on when nothing goes on? In a place that violent and filled of turmoil, the tension appears as fast as it vanishes. The tension is dealt in the mind, with the well drawn characters fight together with the common fear: War, Death.<br/><br/>A good movie, that approaches war at a different angle. I took a good surprise at seeing it. <br/><br/>""We are the hammer of God and that hammer is falling down"""
"daniel-ambia","9","2","3","23 January 2007"," Great War movie
","Although the boot camp scenes appear to be derived from Full Metal Jacket, the lingo is authentic. If you remember Mr. Emery was in the Marines so he wasn't making that stuff up. As for the war, that was the most realistic part. Because of the troop buildup and technical support, Desert Storm was the face of modern war. (The quagmire in Iraq today caused by Bush is not in my opinion a good example of modern warfare.) Anyway the story follows a young sniper through training and deployment to Saudi Arabia where he finds himself waiting for months guarding oil fields in the Saudi desert. When the battle call is given, led by his Staff Sergeant ( Jamie Foxx in top form) the sniper begins the long trek toward the heart of Kuwait and the enemy. Unfortunately the war takes off without the infantry leaving them in the dust of the armored divisions and the air force. By the time the Marines enter the kill zone the war is all but over. This is an excellent film but if you are expecting a war film with blood and guts this is not the movie for you. This is a movie for marines and soldiers who understand the loneliness of deployment and the relentlessness of constant repetitive military training that you know you may never have to use in the first place. It is a story of the human struggle to overcome personal hardships. I love this movie."

All of the cast from Jake Gyllenhaal's lead to Chris Cooper's 60 seconds of screen time, are brilliant, every character is real, every word that they speak is part of an overall statement and the cinematography is sublime.<br/><br/>This movie is a truly gritty and insightful journey through the war, at no time does it try and falsify emotions or disguise the true images; yet it isn't what is generally considered to be a war film.

"seaview1","7","2","3","15 November 2005"," JARHEAD's Dogs of War
","The first Gulf War in Iraq has been an occasional subject matter of films, but not until Jarhead has a bona fide story emerged which captures the experience and heartache as told by director Sam Mendes. Although Mendes has never been able to match the heights of American Beauty, he does an effective job of making the audience a participant in the rigors of desert warfare.<br/><br/>Raw recruits are thrust into rough, basic training (at times with tragic results) as they are prepared for duty in Iraq. Among them are Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Troy (Peter Sarsgaard). Drill Sgt. Siek (Jamie Foxx) whips the young men into soldiers as they are deployed in the Persian Gulf with the imminent threat of war. This is a rough life with constant humiliation and hazing. Then comes Operation Desert Shield with the endless training, waiting, monotony, and more time away from family and home where wives and girlfriends lose touch or stray. Such is the hapless life of the grunt. A hostile terrain such as dirty oil fields adds to the isolation and need for rebellious acts to mitigate frustration. Swofford and Troy are groomed to be snipers, and when their opportunity comes in Operation Desert Storm, they are more than ready until they are dealt an unexpected turn of events.<br/><br/>The recurring phrase or motif in the film is ""Welcome to the suck."" That about sums up what these men are put through. Adapted by William Broyles Jr. from Swofford's own real life experiences, it is an uncompromising recreation of 'the suck'. Mendes is content to show you what it was like but never dwells on any one scene longer than needed to get his point across.<br/><br/>Told essentially from his point of view, the film opens and closes with a telling monologue by Swofford that sums up his experience. He and Troy form the nucleus of the film's conscience and soul. Swofford made the mistake of signing up while Troy is the ironic soldier who wants to fight a war but is thwarted by bureaucracy. The film does ring true in its depiction of the preparation for warfare with the heavy toll it takes on the soldiers and their personal lives. Periodically, an on screen tag will appear to list the number of days the surging numbers of troops were in Iraq (5000 troops increases to 575,000 troops in 175 days), which helps put the events in perspective. This film demythologizes war and instead presents war as a difficult and often life changing experience resulting not from actual combat, but from the tedium and loneliness.<br/><br/>It is important to note that although Swofford shows a dislike for this man's army, he continues to do as he is told. This apolitical film does not really take a stance on the war. We really don't get enough background on Swofford or Troy to understand what makes these men tick. Rather, we are left with what they experience and how they respond on a superficial level. Troy comes across as inconsistent and his motivations are questionable. While the evolution of their relationship doesn't always make sense, the film still packs an emotional punch. About two-thirds through, the film's momentum begins to lose some steam and direction. There is also a sad event toward the end that is never fully explained.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal (Proof, Donnie Darko) is showing good maturity as an actor, and Sarsgaard (Kinsey) is effective as his closest buddy. Jamie Foxx (Ray) registers quite convincingly as the leader of this bunch. Dennis Haysbert and Chris Cooper have short but effective moments as commanding officers with axes to grind.<br/><br/>Although movies have been set in the Iraqi conflict like Three Kings, this film deals directly with the soldiers who must do the dirty work. In some ways this film shares a pedigree with an ensemble piece like Battleground. There are allusions to the Vietnam War particularly at the end involving a Vietnam veteran and also in clips from Vietnam movies like Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter. The early drills recall some of the most harrowing moments from Full Metal Jacket with the verbal insults and discipline. In fact, some of the vicious lines are hysterically funny. It's certainly a far cry from An Officer and Gentlemen. Like the soldiers at the beginning of Born on the Fourth of July, they go in wide eyed, full of optimism, and ready for action. Instead, what they find is something that beats their spirits down. In a way, the structure of vignettes and random incidents is similar to The Big Red One without the periodic voice-over. Pop songs of the era are matched perfectly to scenes. Technical aspects are good including the camera work and editing. There are some memorable images including an eerie scene where the patrol comes upon a charred caravan of vehicles with burned, Iraqi people.<br/><br/>Jarhead is not a perfect film, but it is well acted and pulls no punches on what it must have been like in Iraq. Those looking for an action packed war film will be severely disappointed and let down. Except for some character inconsistencies, it is a realistic study in the psychological toll that military life takes on a human being."

Going in I didn't know what to expect.<br/><br/>My reaction to the film is one of disappointed enjoyment. The problem for me is that the film becomes a series of loosely connected sequences that didn't hold together once we head for the desert. No doubt that this is the result of compressing the source down because you really can't show several hundred days of people doing nothing. All of the bits were excellent unto themselves but at the same time they didn't connect well to each other and so I became distracted with each jump in time.<br/><br/>This isn't to say this isn't a good film, it is. Its a very good film that clearly shows the boredom of modern warfare. Hurry up and wait. In its way its a very good anti war film since it clearly shows that the military is not all fun and games. One guy I was talking to on a train the other day, loved the film. He also said that while he wanted to serve his country, he was going to look for other options since after seeing this film the excitement to boredom level seemed to be very low.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing.

"Matt_Layden","8","2","3","12 November 2005"," ""Welcome To The Suck...OORAH""
","Jarhead (the self-imposed moniker of the Marines) follows Swoff, a third-generation enlistee, from a sobering stint in boot camp to active duty, sporting a sniper's rifle and a hundred-pound ruck on his back through Middle East deserts with no cover from intolerable heat or from Iraqi soldiers, always potentially just over the next horizon. Swoff and his fellow Marines sustain themselves with sardonic humanity and wicked comedy on blazing desert fields in a country they don't understand against an enemy they can't see for a cause they don't fully fathom.<br/><br/>Jarhead is a war movie that actually doesn't have that much war shown in the film. Without any political statements to make, Jarhead simply tells the story of a solider in the war, who desperately wants to kill someone, something, anything. In order to let the madness go away from the unsettling nervousness one would have in a situation like this. So don't see this movie to see some politics because Sarsgaard said it best. ""F*ck politics...it's all bull****, it doesn't matter. We're here now."" The opening of the film is brings us back to the day when we first saw a film titled ""Full Metal Jacket"" and while the rest of the film also makes a comparison to it, it is able to distinguish itself as refreshing.<br/><br/>What makes Jarhead so interesting to watch is not the fact that they have to battle an enemy, but rather themselves when they have no one to kill. When your sent to war with all the training and skills to kill an individual and are not able to, it will make you go crazy. So when the opportunity finally comes up for Swoff he jumps at the chance, although when that opportunity is taken away from him at the last second, the sniper scouter, Troy, literally breaks down. This is the stress that the soldiers must constantly go through every day out there. For the soldiers there are only a few outlets for this stress.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal has the usual soldier goes crazy scene, but here it is compelling and not clichéd. You do not know what the outcome will be, which surprisingly is unique. Then again it could be the fact that Gyllenhaal plays crazy so well...Donnie Darko anyone? From here till the Oscars, I'll wear my Sarsgaard for Supporting Actor Pin. For a character who says welcome to the suck every ten minutes, Sarsgaard is able to give a charismatic and electric performance. Foxx plays the prick drill Sargent, he's rough and crude and plays it to a tee. While Foxx has the flashier supporting part, it's Sarsgaard who is more gripping and will ultimately get the recognition.<br/><br/>Mendes has a few ""artistic"" shots, that are pleasing to the eye. Like the shadows of two soldiers sitting in front of a red/orange sunset, or a soldier standing, while the oil burns behind him.<br/><br/>Powerful and humorous is what Jarhead is, and it can join fight club on the list of guy movies. When every soldier watches the most famous scene from Apocalypse Now, you get pumped up yourself. You get attached to these soldiers and when the one soldier watches ""Deer Hunter"", you can't help but feel the sorrow that he feels. Or even when Gyllenhaal gets the unexpected 'welcome home' from his girlfriend.<br/><br/>With the final 10 minutes of the film, it tries to throw an emotional punch at you, but misses. It would have hit, if it were not in a montage, but centred more on the topic at hand. If it does punch you, it's a light one because it comes and goes so fast. With no explanation at all. Jarhead is a movie with powerful performances and a great eye behind the camera. It's raw realism owes itself to the book that it was based on. Jarhead goes into the category as one of the few movies that makes me want to read the material that it was made from."

","Jarhead is a war movie that's as much about war as Raging Bull was about boxing. That is, it's a film about isolation, boredom, and when you just boil it all down, sexual deprivation. Jarhead has a premise to be exceptionally good, and at times, it is. But it's storyline is messy. If Anthony Swofford was an unreliable narrator in the purest sense of the word, that would be okay. Throughout the film, we are given a glimpse into his fears of coming home to an unfaithful girlfriend, as his brothers in arms fantasize about sleeping with her. These scenes, in particular, really stuck with me. Already tormented with insecurity, it would have been really powerful had Jarhead focused in on Anthony's growing paranoia about his relationship. Mendes only makes this aspect one of the many symptoms of the isolation of war. To that effect, Jarhead on the whole feels like a spiritual reboot of Full Metal Jacket. Not that that's a bad thing, but it's not something we haven't seen before."

","""Jarhead"" has always stood out in my mind when I think of the essential war films. Up there in good company with the likes of ""Platoon"", ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". On first glance, before viewing, Sam Mendes's adaptation of Anthony Swofford's book about his personal experiences in the US Marines during the First Gulf War in 1991, could be dismissed as some glamourous Hollywood matinee. But it truly is a fine psychological study of men at war, and an authentic snapshot of what war can, and often is like, for soldiers; sometimes boring, with sustained periods of high-stress and readiness, rushing to battle only to find that the war has already moved on up the road when you get there.<br/><br/>Swoff is a young man 'lost on my way to college' when he enlists in the US Marines. After training, Saddam has invaded Kuwait and the West answers the call to defend the oil fields - in Operation Desert Shield - before the inevitable offensive to drive Saddam back into Iraq in Operation Desert Storm. An elite trained sniper, Swoff, like the rest of his platoon, can not wait to get into 'the suck'. But when they get in country, they find themselves stranded in the middle of the desert, preparing, masturbating, and waiting, and waiting, for their war to begin before it is over. A very intimate portrayal of men at war, Nirvana's ""Something in the Way"" accompanies a very poignant scene where our disillusioned and restless protagonist, homesick for a potentially unfaithful woman, dreams in the stifling heat."

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Jarhead is a biographical war movie that premiered in 2005. The movie is directed by Sam Mendes. The movie is based on the book Jarhead by Anthony Swofford. The movie stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Peter Sarsgaard, Chris Cooper, Lucas Black, and Jamie Foxx. The movie is about a group of United States Marine Corp recruits that go through training and then are deployed to the Gulf War.<br/><br/>Jarhead is an incredibly authentic movie. This movie has an authentic portrayal of life in the United States Marine Corp. The movie makes the United States Marine Corp out to be an independent and storied institution. The recruits are what is expected from how the military recruits young adults. There really is not anything held back in the portrayal of the United States Marine Corp. The audience does see the insanity that is caused by shipping abroad and the sheer boredom the soldiers on the ground will endure.<br/><br/>The movie's greatest attribute is its cinematography and visuals. This is a stunningly gorgeous movie that recreates the Gulf War. The attention to detail and visuals produced by the creators of the movie should be commended. The Highway of Death and other classic Gulf War iconography is shown in this movie in gruesome detail. It made for the movie being incredibly authentic. The audience does feel like a person that is on the ground with the soldiers in the Gulf War.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal does an amazing job as Anthony Swofford. He is able to portray the gruff sniper that only wants a kill in his squad. The audience experiences the sheer boredom that entails being a Marine sniper. This performance is among one of the best by Jake Gyllenhaal.<br/><br/>I would recommend 'Jarhead'.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

"Tweekums","8","1","1","16 July 2017"," Waiting for the war to start
","Anthony ""Swoff"" Swofford could have gone to college; instead he enlisted in the US Marine Corps he soon starts to wonder if he made the right choice. He isn't very enthusiastic but shows aptitude with a rifle and ends up a Sniper Scout. When Saddam Hussein's forces invade Kuwait in the summer of 1990 it looks as though Swoff and his comrades are about to see action. They deploy to Saudi Arabia and await their orders to cross the border. They wait and they wait and they wait; as the weeks and months pass they stew in the desert and boredom takes its toll. Tempers fray, discipline breaks down and Swoff starts to question his sanity. When the order is finally given the war moves so fast that the Marines are behind the action; all they see is the aftermath of air attacks and burning oil fields then just as it looks as if they are going to see action the war is over.<br/><br/>This is unusual for a 'war' movie in that there is so little actual war. Before that we get training scenes that will be familiar to anybody who has seen 'Full Metal Jacket' and the bulk of the film that shows us the marines waiting to go into battle. These scenes impressively capture the boredom and frustration the men suffer. Some of the ill-discipline is rather surprising; one can only hope that it is exaggerated for dramatic effect especially the scene where Swoff threatens a fellow Marine with a loaded rifle! The scenes showing what the squad see during the war are disturbing without being too upsetting; most notably the night scene amongst the burning oil wells. The cast is solid with Jake Gyllenhaal dominating as Swoff. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody wanting a war film that is somewhat different to most; importantly for a film that is largely about boredom I never found it boring."

","JarHead was one the most riveting war-drama that is bold and yet sympathizing.<br/><br/>Based on former Marine Anthony Swofford's best-selling 2003 book , Jarhead tells about the experiences of Swofford while going through rigorous military training in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.<br/><br/>From the director of American Dream , Sam Mendes brings you a very powerful drama about the frustration and anger experienced by an army man away from family , away from home and away from your loved ones.

Wish the second half would have been more impacting. Screenplay is decent. Cinematography is world-class , art direction and dialogues are good. Editing is loose. Jake Gylanhall is superb as Marin Swofford. He is one of most underrated actor. He emotes effectively through his eyes and has given a brave performance.

","Jarhead is a great, great movie. Superb performances by Gyllenhaal, Foxx, and Sarsgaard. It reflected the war from a soldiers point of view very well, and evenly balanced both views of how Bush and his administration is handling it. Either way, though, these men were taught to ignore politics and do what they were told, because arguing why they were there was pointless in the end. My only wish is that we could've seen a little more of Chris Cooper, whose one scene was very well presented indeed. The writing seemed to reflect an almost love hate relationship with the Marines, showing both the honor and the bullshit of loyalty and rules. On the whole, this movie was moving and entertaining, and in a small sense, enlightening. And for a girl who isn't a big fan of masculine shoot-em-up war movies (which this very much is), I was surprisingly pleased."

"brodlimmel","Null","1","1","13 September 2011"," Jarheading experience
","As a fan of war films I really enjoyed this movie for focusing only on the marines and very little of the war. They are fighting in the Gulf War which this is the only movie I've seen that they are fighting in Dessert Storm. Something people I knew that seen it there is fighting scenes the solders never see combat and that will throw off many audience members if they think they are getting into the traditional war film will blood and guts and explosions.<br/><br/>The story follows many of the marines but the main character is Anthony Swoffward played by Jake Gyllenhall is a kid who only joined because he couldn't get into college and being a Jarhead was in the family his dad joined his grandpa joined. Swoff gets to be a scout sniper one of the coolest things in the marines. One complaint there is the whole sniper thing doesn't even matter until the end otherwise the whole movie could just be about a marine with no special title like a sniper.<br/><br/>The emotional aspect in this movie is deep almost a little too emotional. There is one scene where the marines are watching a sex video and one notices it is his wife and neighbor and that is just one of those holy crap moments where you feel for this marine who isn't even part of the main cast. Besides the wives and girlfriends cheating on these guys you also see the war take it's hold on these guys either they have emotional break downs or they turn psycho.<br/><br/>The action in this is phenomenal Jake Gyllenhall is great in this he really seems human in this role and you sympathize with him. Another great performance is by Peter Sarsgaard he plays great as the guy holding the marines together and he has this emotional scene towards the end that just leaves you feeling sorry for this poor guy. The weakest of them all was Jamie Foxx he has the funnest lines in the movie but has no emotion to him he is kind of a flat character compared to the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>Overall I think this is a very unappreciated war film and it has its problems but is not to be overlooked I say a good rental and you will be satisfied with what this movie bring to the table."

","I give this movie a solid ""8"", meaning 80%. I would have loved to give it more but I feel that a lot more might have been done to add a sense of loneliness and emptiness for this film's Gulf War soldier. The acting was superb all-around, but the misanthropic disillusion that A. Swofford communicates in his memoir is shared between the other actors in the film adaptation. I've read several dip-sh*t reviews alluding that this is a movie about liberals from Hollywood. Well, Swofford might have hoped to cash out... but he just wrote a book, not a movie.<br/><br/>In total, the Gulf War was a unique situation, where ground troops saw minimal resistance. Swofford's book is told in a fragmented pattern, skipping non-chronologically. The movie tells the tale chronologically, and collapses details. Swofford's partner Johnny Rotten is combined with Fowler in the movie. An oil-covered horse beneath the glow of burning oil derricks is added for ""Apocalypse Now"" artistic flair.<br/><br/>It's a good movie, but it was not Full Metal Jacket, few are."
"KineticSeoul","7","1","1","1 February 2011"," Hoorah!
","This wasn't a typical war movie as I expected, instead it sort of has the ""Full Metal Jacket"" vibe to it. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if this movie was influenced by that movie. At the start of the movie I thought it was going to be one of those dull war movies, but it got engaging really quick. It's based off the book, a true story written by Anthony Swofford, his life briefly﻿ before the enlisting, while in the Marines and after and overall it's a good movie. Jake Gyllenhaal did a good job but really started to impress me as the film went along and I liked his character as the film progressed as well. Jamie Foxx put on a great performance playing Staff Sgt. Sykes, slightly reminded me of a young Denzel Washington. I personally liked Peter Sarsgaard character, although his character is a bit of a prick but he is not as obnoxious as the rest of the team and straight to the point. The first 30 minutes was intriguing for the most part than it started to kill time by showing marines goofing off and doing random stuff during their free time, but I guess it showed the bonding aspect of it all. Some people bash on this movie for not having enough action for a war movie, and I know sometimes Drill Sergeants say stuff like ""Save the drama for your mama"". But this movie is more about the drama than the action, but it's still alright since it's kinda a manly drama. Plus I liked most of the dialogue in this movie. I just wished the impact of the film was as good as the beginning of it, cause the film started to lose it's momentum as it went along. It's basically a war movie with almost no death in it or at least you won't see people dying much, but has great character development for a war movie. Even if this movie isn't really focused on the subject matter like some reviewers claim, it's definitely worth watching, especially since you can get it at walmart for like $5 bucks.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"Hitchcoc","8","1","1","11 October 2010"," The Harsh Reality
","The old war movies are so simple. Our heroes are eventually going to meet that adversary and finish the issue. This is a film about the boredom, the alienation, the disconnectedness that takes place in wartime. The men in this film are hung out to dry in the desert. Remember the first gulf war was fought mostly with high tech weapons and bombing runs. Of course, there were ground casualties and close fighting in some places, but this film is more about the tension that develops when those with their fingers on the triggers are made to stand down. I think the most gripping part of the film is when the oil fields are burning a and sludgy rain of oil ash and black particles rain from the sky. These guys suffocate on this. It's like a plague from the Bible. All they can do is trudge through it. There is much more to this film, but the bottom line is what the heck is the enemy and what do we poor soldiers have to do to confront it? The answer in this case is to wait and see."

","Jarhead was a movie I was actually excited to see, due to the subject nature and the real life story behind it. While it wasn't downright boring, I found myself having problems keeping myself interested in it. The performances aren't a problem, but the characters are in my opinion. Not many of them are very easy to relate too. Jake Gyllenhall's portrayal of Anthony Swofford is tremendously acted, but his character is somewhat cold and distant|which i Know how Swofford was in real life, and that was the point, but still| and none of the secondary characters were that likable either, in all honesty it was rather depressing. Maybe i'm picky, but I don't like movies that start depressing, and then have a depressing payoff. It drains me completely and just ruins my mood, I was kind of angry to be honest. I don't know much about Swofford's experiences, nor do I care too to be honest, I'd prefer to read something much more lively and happy.<br/><br/>Performances. Jake Gyllenhaal is often excellent, and did a wonderful portrayal. However his character is much too cold and distant for my liking, taking away his likability for me. Peter Sarsgaard is very good as Troy. His mysterious past and the hidden pain he has was very interesting to watch, even if it was hard to sympathize with. Jamie Foxx is really good in his role, even if it's a bit more limited than I would have liked. Lucas Black is good in his hot-headed, yet likable role.<br/><br/>Bottom line. It wasn't terrible, in fact its the farthest thing from it. It's just too depressing, and was very hard for me to relate too. Worth a viewing of course, it just wasn't my cup of tea.<br/><br/>6/10"
"johnnyboyz","5","1","1","16 May 2010"," Intermittedly interesting look at the calm before no-storm-at-all in Gulf War One, which weeps more for the loss of oil than the loss of life amidst many other frustrations.
","Poor Jake Gyllenhaal is in the desert and going mad in Jarhead. There are no Arabs to shoot and no girlfriend around to penetrate over the course of the long, hot and dusty tour he's doing over there during Gulf War One in Sam Mendes' 2006 film. What is Jarhead other than a slightly annoying film about rather annoying people itching to engage in warfare and spend their time indulging in frat-boy infused humour? The film is a dead zone if you came looking for an interesting look at what it was like fighting on the frontline of The First Gulf War, the air of relief acting as a faux smoke screen over the sense of frustration towards the end when the troops realise the war is over and some of them never even got to fire their weapon; never even got to feel the manly sensation of having killed someone. So much so that the film needs to rely on a veteran of the Vietnam War to join them on a parade vehicle once they're back home so as to raise our awareness, or remind us, of what war is actually like when it becomes obvious the last hour and a half may have been a little tough, but guys in the U.S. Marines have had it far worse in the past.<br/><br/>Jarhead's a bit like that, scattered and unfocused in tone and overall attitudes to its subject matter; as if Mendes himself, a director I like a lot, identified how lacklustre the source material really is and tried to tiptoe around that fact. The film is unashamed in its calling to mind past items so as to tell us what war was REALLY like; its imagery persistently calling to mind past war films of old in the clearing out of the squad toilets alá Platoon; the clear referencing to Full Metal Jacket in the boot camp training sequences and the generality of how that is structured along with the frontline action; the oral referencing to Apocalypse Now in the Ride of the Valkyries music the troops boom out of their speakers and the worst instance of which sees the opening few seconds of 1978's The Deer Hunter begin playing on a television, before inexplicably cutting to a homemade pornography movie of one of the squadies' partners with a neighbour. Such is the film's attitude to its study: the worry about what's happening back home and the instabilities of these people's home-life over the difficulties and harsh realities of wartime service. For a better film about the stagnant perspective of conflict, check out 2007 Israeli film Beaufort. <br/><br/>Gyllenhaal is indeed the lead, a certain Anthony Swofford who is in a sniper regiment in The Gulf, and being a sniper, the film has an excuse to shoot everything down his scope, so he's able to 'look' at everything through it and there's that sense he's 'looking' through his scope and 'observing' everything around him first hand in a first person perspective. Swofford has very few decent memories of life; a troubled childhood and not an awful lot going on in the early years of his life, he sees the Marines as a sort of second chance or re-birthing into another life or world. His raw and relatively unflinching introduction to this life is by way of a dopey slow motion christening, the spreading of dirt and grime over his forehead and facial area as he informs us his combat experience ""has begun"".<br/><br/>Jarhead initially looks through pro-war tints at the idea of war and the prospect of warfare, by the end I think most of the troops are still the same. War's treated as if it's something to look forward to in regards to these people with their ""go get 'em"" attitude accompanying a generally upbeat, pacey aesthetic the piece carries. By the end, it turns out to be something that came very close to happening but, annoyingly for them, didn't quite materialise: it's there; it comes (to a degree) and then it goes – so what? By the time the boot-camp sequences are over, Jarhead slots down into a groove of waiting and stewing; the troops forever angry at the lack of action and women as well as the painstaking attempts to relieve boredom by strenuous routines of having to clean one's rifle amidst other menial events they didn't travel there to do. The problem here that the film makes its points very quickly, Jarhead being one of those rare war films that asks for pity from the audience for its characters without any of them ever really having faced any warfare. <br/><br/>How would those that liked it have taken to a piece similar to this that revolved around young troops, American or otherwise, about to embark on the D-Day campaign? What about a WW2 film set on the Eastern front about young trigger-happy, pro-war Russian troops about to siege a German stronghold to a bumpy, upbeat aesthetic with sprinklings of crass comedy before ending as the siege begins? We'd feel a little robbed, like we'd spent 'x' amount of time with unpleasant people and then it ended. Maybe WW2 is too much of a taboo, but clearly there's no problem in documenting tours served in Gulf War One in this manner. Whatever the reason, the film is a celebration of soldier machismo and resilience in a location the film goes to painstaking lengths to paint as really hostile and tough. At the end of The Thin Red Line; Platoon and Saving Private Ryan, we are asked to weep for men young and old whose lives are forever changed in their experiences; at the end of Jarhead, we are supposed to feel for dumb-dumb in their attitudes Yank soldiers whose tours in the desert has instilled them with a faux sense of accomplishment and provides them with stories to tell that are infused with a pseudo sense of accomplishment, and it doesn't work."

","All though understated by many, Jarhead remains one of the most realistic and powerful war films of time. The power in the film is raw and up-beat, emotional and tragic, humorous and sad. All of these are present throughout and stick with you way after the film has ended. For once since 1998's Saving Private Ryan a skilled director like Mendes can put the audience in the shoes of a soldier fighting for his country. Not only does the director achieve this aspect greatly but then makes the experience and realisation of war seem real, graphic and accurate. <br/><br/>By no means the greatest film ever made but for story, acting, directing and cinematography Jarhead is certainly near ace among those categories.

"Karl Self","7","1","1","16 August 2008"," Half Metal Jacket
","Jarhead is an innovative war movie which held my attention well and does have its moments. It's actually a lot like Full Metal Jacket, without being exploitative of the former, and unfortunately, also without being quite as good.<br/><br/>The movie follows the autobiographical account of a marine sniper (Surveillance / Target Acquisition = STA) in the first Gulf War. This was a fairly boring war, in that the US military fully exploited their technological advantage to bomb Iraqi forces into submission, which didn't leave a lot for the ground units to do. Kind of like the current Iraq war in reverse. The bottom line is that the author, although highly trained and motivated, saw practically no action.<br/><br/>The movie is (as far as I can judge) realistic in that it reproduces the soldier's perspective pretty well: you're never really on top of things information-wise, and doubly scared that you might either buy it or not see any action at all. The latter comes true for the narrator, who doesn't even get to fire his rifle once. Overall, he probably left the arena feeling that despite all his efforts, he contributed absolutely nothing to a war that was fought out by ""zoomies"" (planes and rockets).<br/><br/>The movie doesn't have a lot of action, and consequently struggles a bit to fill its length. I didn't like the scenes which seemed to have been taken out of some gay softporn flick, with lots of cute but moody underwear models lounging around in army outfits and being a bit too physical with each other. The burning oilwells-scene was visually overdone. But there are many great scenes, too, such as when the STA team beg for being allowed to kill at least one Iraqi before an airstrike because ""It's not fair, he's going to die anyway!"". Or in the way the movie displays the interactions between the comrades.

","I am a gulf war vet and I liked it,,,,,Most people will want to write a long review,,,I will choose a short path,,,,What I liked about this film is the fact that it does show how some people who go into the military really fall for all the wooo haaa crap they preach,,,I mean take our two snipers, They had went into the marine corp trained to be snipers,,,,Got filled to the gills with bravado and then when they got there big chance ( a target ) the red tape of the military stepped in and took there chance away from them...The kill shot was given to another snipper....Now the thing is I never did fall for all the propaganda the military dished out..I took what I needed the most and threw out the rest....I think what bothers me the most about the military is the training It is one thing to build somebody up but It also must be taught to them that when the war is over people will not want to really here about it,,,nor will they care,,,,And all the bravado needs to be left in the closet when you get home or else some politically correct person will want to call the cops on you....And my last thought on the marines was when I worked with them,,It was a horrible time It never ended about how much better they were than the army....I myself could care less and I would just walk away...I did the same job as they did and I really got tired of all the we are better than you talk....OK so you are, Now pass the salt and pepper...."
"bobsgrock","7","1","1","31 January 2008"," A solid war piece.
","Compared to Sam Mendes' other works, this one lacks the really powerful acting and original storyline of American Beauty or Road to Perdition. Compared to other war films, however, it is still a strong piece that shows the obscurity and tediousness the Marines went through in the Gulf War. The cinematography is very good, with the scenes of burning oil being beautiful to look at. Overall, I thought this film was very neutral in its message. It isn't pro-war or anti-war. It simply shows what Anthony Swofford and other Marines went through and what they continue to go through after returning home. If anything, watching this film should increase our respect for anyone who fights in the military. It is a rough life, and all that sign up for it deserve to be respected by those who do not."
"Jakethemuss","8","1","1","24 July 2007"," its not about fighting...its about NOT fighting
","First off. Don't go into this film expecting some hard boiled, guns blazing epic about heroics in the heat of combat. This isn't told from the point of view which fans of old WW2 maybe familiar with. So please don't say ""It didn't have any fighting in it"" after the movie ends, as thats the point of the film.<br/><br/>The story follows in the steps of raw marine recruits, or Jarheads, primarily Anthony Sworford (Jake Gyllenthal) who are just starting their tour of duty in Iraq. Being in their late teens early 20's they are pumped up, full of testosterone, and ready for some action. But as the film progresses, it dawns on them they misunderstood what ""war"" actually is. Gone are the days of cavalry charges, battleground gunfights, valour. Man has been replaced by machine, war has become about technology, not about courage.<br/><br/>Hoever, they are all in the same situation, young, inexperienced, far from home, and fighting against an enemy they can't see. Comradeship plays a key part in this move, as the marines realise all they have is each other, the marine next to them. They begin to form bonds that can never be broken, as they face the unpleasant pressures of war together.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes does a terrific job in the directors chair, with Thomas Newman contributing to a brilliant score as always. The cinematography of the vast open landscapes, burning oil fields and sweltering hot deserts is spot on, and helps create the atmosphere for this film."

","I was fascinated by the indoctrination of the Marines before they were ever sent to war.<br/><br/>It seems that they take great pains to build them into a unit that performs its mission without question.<br/><br/>It was sad to see what happened when they were sent to Desert Storm. Over six months in the desert heat and nothing to show for it. Lives lost to friendly fire, marriages and relationships destroyed. An unending tale of disease from the atmosphere over there, and they never even used the training they received.<br/><br/>This film had a lot of stars: Jake Gyllenhaal, Jamie Foxx, Peter Sarsgaard, Lucas Black, Chris Cooper, and Dennis Haysbert, but it wasn't about the characters, it was about the futility of it all. That makes it worthwhile viewing."

","Any person who read the book would not be disappointed with the movie.<br/><br/>Any person who was in the military with their eyes open would not be scandalized.<br/><br/>To impute some kind of political motivation to the movie makers betrays ignorance of the both the contents of the book and the experience of military service.<br/><br/>Was it a great movie? No. Did it do a good job of capturing the spirit of Swofford's book? Yes.<br/><br/>Read ""Catch 22"" then go see the movie.

If you hanker after John Wayne or Audie Murphy, you're in the wrong century.<br/><br/>In ""Saving Private Ryan"", in my opinion, one of the top five films of all time, Sergeant Horvath says, at one point, that we might as well try to protect the bridge and save Ryan's ass because it might help make this whole war make some sense. If even fighting Hitler and the Nazis makes no sense on a day to day basis, how does liberating Kuwait make any sense? The reality of military life and combat makes no sense and this movie and the book on which it's based illustrates that fact."
"vmwrites","7","1","1","15 February 2007"," Directorial Similarities with Full Metal Jacket
","I watched this movie with interest, because there were so many directorial similarities with Full Metal Jacket. The stories and content of the two movies were different, of course, but in many ways ""Jarhead"" appeared to be a sort of directorial tribute to Stanley Kubrick's directorial tour de force, in Full Metal Jacket.<br/><br/>The linguistic style of the main characters' narratives in both movies was similar. There were also similarities in the use of camera angles of the Marines in formation as they moved through combat areas; silhouette shots of Marines, with fire behind them; etc.<br/><br/>This post should NOT be taken as a criticism, because many creative and innovative directors - such as Alfred Hitchcock and Fritz Lang - have been honored by other directors who may, from time to time, adapt certain stylistic techniques.<br/><br/>Among the better directorial techniques was the use of subdued sepia tones to depict the monotony of day to day life in the desert.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought the movie was a good one, although I would have liked to see a little backstory on some of the Marines in the group."
"melissa-feagin","9","1","1","28 January 2007"," Good military movie
","Being someone in the military, this movie had lots of moments that hit home. Being in the Navy, we (although we'd never admit it publicly) envy the Marine Corps and their tight-knit units. In the Navy, people are transferred as individuals and a Marine unit sticks together always, so they are much more like family..with goofy ways like a family and silly traditions. Marines are crazy, tough, hard-shelled teddy bears that have people they love fiercely and a cause they love even more. So this movie had many moments that, while revealing the absurdity of the war in the Gulf, brought a personal spin to it that CNN has just forgotten. For some reason, during WWII, Korea, Vietnam, and pretty much every other war until Desert Storm, soldiers were called, well, SOLDIERS. Now that they're referred to as ""troops"", it takes so much personal care out of it that people don't think of our soldiers as humans with lives and loves of their own. Jarhead is a great movie for showing that even rock solid Marines are humans, too. His girlfriend, who he dreamed about and missed, left him while he was there, and that's something that almost every military couple has had to deal with..cheating, being cheated on, the fear of it, and that's a very real concern to young Marines, or Soldiers, or Sailors, or Airmen. The film has so many anti-climatic moments which make the viewer sort of antsy and unfulfilled, which is perfect because that's exactly how many of the characters were portrayed to feel. In a war with minimal violence but high ""terror factor"", exactly like the war that's going on now, service members are taught to ""always be on the ready"" but never get a chance to release that coiled tension. Other wars have been ""kill, kill, kill"" and these are ""watch, watch, watch."" People who are trained to kill tend to go a little loopy when they're not able to kill, which is captured perfectly in the scene in the tower where the main character has a perfect shot of the enemy lined up only to have the shot canceled in lieu of an air strike and his only ""kill"" is taken away from him. Sadistic, yes, but to be expected when people are trained for just that purpose. Many touching moments if you are in the military and understand that tight, delicate brotherhood you develop. The way the main character wore his dress uniform to go to his girlfriend's house when he returned home, in a desperate attempt to impress her and make her understand a tiny bit of what he was about, only to be shot down, a proud Marine defeated on the home turf... it was an incredibly touching moment to those of us who have been separated for months and months at a time and dreaded that very moment. All in all, an excellent ""war"" movie as it applies to the current ""desert"" wars...great characters and many poignant scenes. I would recommend highly to anyone in the military or related to a service member, but anyone else just might not ""get it."""

Jake Gillingham's ugly, lumpy face looking blankly at stuff while his voice over goes 'I'm going a bit mental by the way' every 5 minutes. His character was a total idiot and so was everyone else in the film. Bunch of idiots in the desert doing nothing, talking about masturbation and how bored they are. Not half as bored as I was watching the rubbish. <br/><br/>Moral of the story: War's not that good, a bit boring, not much to do but masturbate.<br/><br/>GREAT!<br/><br/>Plus, all the bits where Mendes tries to pay homage to Full Metal Jacket were the most pathetic scenes I've ever seen.

","Take out the guns, and the desert, and this is a summercamp movie. If you want to see a movie about being lost. This is it. I'm pretty sure the director was lost also. And you'll definitively be lost when its over. Aside from the shots that were obviously ""inspired"" by other war movies, i didn't see much great cinematic moments in this film at all, and i fail to see how this will somehow become a ""classic"". This movie vaguely wanders from ""war is hell"" to ""brotherhood"" to whatever else it was trying to say, and never delves fully into anything. And i don't feel it touched the ""war is hell"" subject out of any honest philosophizing or self-questioning, but rather just because its expected to be seen in a war movie. The most *annoying* part of the film i find has to be the ""summercamp movie"" style soundtrack, as in whenever there is any action you'll hear an ultra cheesy song start playing really loud. It really breaks the almost-spirit of this movie. A major failing of this movie is i was completely unable to feel any empathy for any of the characters. What was i supposed to feel? Pride? they walked around a desert and did a lot of push-ups...so what. Sadness? about what? that they didn't get to kill anybody? That the guy lost his sweetheart girlfriend? yeah cause breakups only happen to marines. The scene at the end was horrible. Where he stares off into the distance and remembers his ""bortherhood""... once a marine...always a marine.. What?? You didn't bond in war! you bonded dancing naked in your tent, getting drunk and jacking off!! You don't miss the marines, you miss your little frat party. You miss summercamp. In the end, i think the director just wanted to make a war movie without having anything to actually say. He watched a lot of war classics, scribbled down the recipe and tried to make his own, but it came out very flat and dry.<br/><br/>gave it 4 stars. 1 star for the main character acting, 3 stars for the cool cinematography."
"swbhoy","3","1","1","25 April 2006"," Pointless
","This may well be an accurate interpretation of one mans experience of Desert Shield / Storm but if that interpretation was little more than a random meandering of frustration, boredom and pent up aggression then, valid as these emotions may be, one wonders why it was deemed film worthy. One of the film's core issues did offer some interest , specifically the question, "" how does a man who is trained to kill react when he is not offered the opportunity to put his training into practice""? The answer though was as deeply unsatisfying as it was trite. The answer, according to Marine Swofford, is childish tantrums and kitchen sink moralising. It was always going to take some delicate handling to find the precarious middle ground that exists between the gung ho soldier movie and the soul searching emotional exploration and , to this reviewers mind at least, Mendes has not even come close. Jarheads was loud, brash and noisy but, ultimately, had very little to say. We continue to wait then, for a gulf war movie that tells us something that we don't already know."
"StudioLAX","3","1","1","8 January 2006"," Boring, uninvolved and indifferent.
","Despite some excellent performances and cinematography I found this film to be an unimaginative take on material treated better in the far superior Full Metal Jacket. The problem with the film is it is just a series of clichéd sketches and MTV style musical interludes showing the dehumanising process of becoming a soldier and in order for this to work you need to care about the characters which you won't. This is another in the seemingly endless line of ""worthy"" Hollywood statement films the problem being that the statement has been made too many times before by better directors. Mendes should return to the stage where I think his talents as a business man would be better suited."
"koolpopoki","Null","1","1","27 November 2005"," A movie that pretends not to be political but, in reality, is is is.
","Jarhead has two themes. The first is an exploration of the degradation and terror that Marine recruits go through in their training. The brainwashing techniques they endure were pioneered by Stalin, Mao and their sycophants but, apparently, are not unique to adherents of totalitarian ideologies.<br/><br/>I work with several people who served the Marine Corps. It makes my skin crawl to realize that they accepted the mindless dictates of fanatical killing and absolute obedience that Jarhead presents. From now on, I'll think of them as psychopaths and be very very careful.<br/><br/>I was glad to see the contemptuous rejection that a couple of the Marines receive from their wives and girlfriends. The Marines made their choices and became hateful people. At least, their women have the sense to dump them.<br/><br/>The second theme of Jarhead is that none of this works. The fully indoctrinated Marines spend months in the Iraqi desert during the First Gulf War, with nothing to do but masturbate and tear each other apart, awaiting their opportunity to kill kill kill their assigned enemies.<br/><br/>But they don't get to. Seems the Air Force boys with their big bombs have taken care of things. All they encounter are dead Iraqis. One of the Marines wants to adopt a burned Iraqi body as his pet but his superior thinks that's not how Marines behave.<br/><br/>The opportunity to kill someone is what's sought more than anything else, and its bureaucratic denial drives some of the boys crazy. Maybe they should have thought a little more about what they were getting into."
"roland-104","8","1","1","20 November 2005"," A ""good enough"" movie about military life
","Anthony Swofford's highly literate 2003 memoir of his days in the Marine Corps, including service as a sniper in the first Gulf War (Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm), gave this film its title and substance. ""Jarhead,"" as nearly everyone must know by now, is slang for a Marine grunt: it refers to the look of the requisite ""high and tight"" haircuts and also to an image of the new soldier as an empty receptacle for indoctrination. ""Jarhead"" is a good enough film, but is far from being a great one.<br/><br/>Swofford's memoir was a decidedly interior book, a narrative about the impact of military training and the threat of war on the soldier's sense of identity, about the resulting intense emotions of self doubt, fear and rage, and the indelible killer instinct training presses upon the soldier. Swofford is interested in the combatants' inner life, their souls. His book is an existential essay on the soldierly experience. Since films are all about action and exteriority, not reflection and states of mind, the prospects for a decent adaptation of a book like Jarhead thus seem dim from the outset.<br/><br/>I realize that it's tedious and trite to complain when a film adaptation of a novel or memoir differs substantially from the book. We're supposed to judge a film on its own merits, not by comparison to its source. But when a film adaptation does not quite hit the mark, sometimes the reason becomes more clear if you turn to the written source. <br/><br/>Actually, because films are about action while books are typically about thought and feeling, few adaptations can be entirely faithful to their sources. Of course there are examples, the grand exceptions, where books are adapted well for the screen, but the whys and wherefores of these successes is a whole separate subject. Just to name two recent ones, though: think of Michael Ondaatje's ""The English Patient,"" adapted for the screen by Anthony Minghella, or Annie Proulx's ""The Shipping News,"" adapted by Lasse Hallstrom and Robert Nelson Jacobs. <br/><br/>My reason for taking the risk of boring you to death here is to point out that this film's great flaw is precisely that so much is lost in translation from the page to the screen. Because existential reflection has to be jettisoned in favor of action for this film, the core of Swofford's powerful writing is lost and we end up with just another movie about military life.<br/><br/>In the boot camp sequence up front we're reminded of Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket."" In the monotony of daily life in the service we pause to recall the drunken boredom of the soldiers in ""From Here to Eternity."" Gripped by the fear that accompanies waiting to encounter a faceless enemy, we think of Vietnam, of films like ""Platoon,"" or the Russian film ""Checkpoint,"" about the Chechnyan War. Sam Mendes even helps us conjure such reflections by having his grunts whoop it up watching ""Apocalypse Now."" <br/><br/>But, like I said, it's a pretty good picture. We follow Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal), his best buddy Alan Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) and a handful of their mates as they endure training, then a painfully long and idle deployment to Saudi Arabia, and, finally, brief and utterly surreal combat. We see a few scenes from a later time as well, back home, a gathering to mourn the loss of one of the guys. The acting all around is solid. Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard are especially good, as is the ensemble of their buddies, especially Evan James, Lucas Black and Jacob Vargas. Jamie Foxx evinces some serious swagger as the hard-edged Staff Sergeant Sykes, who leads the sniper contingent on the desert. <br/><br/>Mendes, a young Brit who came from stage work to film, is smart: he hires top filmmakers to help him. In ""American Beauty"" he enlisted Conrad L. Hall, and his son, Conrad W., to photograph and Thomas Newman to write the music. For ""Jarhead,"" Mendes engaged Roger Deakins (""Shawshank Redemption,"" ""The Big Lebowski"") for his DP and Walter Murch as editor (Murch edited ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""The English Patient"" and the ""Godfather"" trilogy, among many others), and Mendes again used Newman and also Tom Waits to create the score.<br/><br/>So, between the talented acting and the craftsmanship on display here, ""Jarhead"" is well worth your attention. If you want the existential part, read the book. My rating: 7.5/10 (low B+). (Seen on 11/13/05). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites."
"kaplara","9","1","1","19 November 2005"," The classic that never was
","Although I think the finer points have been hit on, I wanted to add my two cents about what is bound to be an over looked classic. Perhaps I should start then by stating why exactly this movie is going to miss the mark, so to speak, while at the same time hitting it so precisely. In the end there are few things which do not boil down to politics, and while competitive democracy has its high points it creates a sort of vacuum of polarization with no in between. This is important because in a world where there is no middle road, we cannot take seriously something un-polarizing and un-opinionated. It's unfortunate but true and it's exactly why some people are going to be unable to enjoy this movie (a lot of people). In fact if you've ever held a protesters sign, regardless of the cause, there is a fairly high chance you will find the lack of moral direction here offensive.<br/><br/>The movie quite literally does the impossible; it portrays war without attempting to lead the viewer to moral conclusions. In fact it is not so simple as to ignore these moral conclusions; you will find characters expressing them from both sides of the moral spectrum. In each case attempts by characters to frame the issue in a certain way simply fall flat in the face of reality. Over optimism finds itself faced with sad truth while true pessimism is never realized. And if the last sentence sounds like it should be impossible, then that is yet further truth of just how good (and different) this movie is.<br/><br/>The objective of this film is to tell a story about people and the effects war has on them. It is funny, sad, disappointing, anticlimactic, beautiful, intense and frustrating especially if you were a character in it. I am not an easy judge of movies (quite harsh actually) but I do enjoy things which attempt a topic from a new angle. Perhaps the fact this is the first war movie which has no angle provides a sad insight into both why it is so good and why it will be so under-appreciated.<br/><br/>~Ryan"
"flipboy923","8","7","18","25 October 2005"," a unique ""war"" movie
","(*SPOILERS WITHIN*) I caught an advanced screening of JARHEAD at the University of Washington last night. The film is a unique take on military life, told through the eyes of the main character, Anthony Swofford.<br/><br/>I hadn't read the novel before I had seen the film, so I came in to it not knowing what to expect. What I got was a movie that had a fresh and different take on war compared to films like Apocalypse Now, Platoon, or Full Metal Jacket.<br/><br/>The film follows Swofford through boot camp and in to Desert Storm. You may think ""oh, that's exactly like FMJ."" That's partially correct, but the difference with Jarhead is that it doesn't focus on the war itself (understatement), but rather the camaraderie and bonding that these Marines have together going through these experiences of pain, joy, and fear.<br/><br/>""Is the film pro or anti war?"" That probably is the big question in everyone's minds going in to this film. For me, the answer to that question is: I don't know. There isn't a direct example that tilts the film in either direction. For example, there's a scene where, with the troops getting ready to go to battle, prepare themselves by watching scenes from Apocalypse Now. The tuber joy and excitement the men showcase in this scene is clearly ironic, cheering on the violence and death in the same fashion frat boys cheer for their football team. However, on the flip side, when the men arrive in the desert, they wait for their call to action. They wait, wait, wait, and wait some more. During these scenes, I actually fond myself thinking ""so when's the action going to happen?"" When the action does happen, however, it happens not in the way you might expect.<br/><br/>Top of the line performances all around, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard. Jamie Foxx delivers a good (but limited) performance of the Staff Sergeant who ""loves his job."" Sam Mendes, the Oscar-winning director of American Beauty and Road to Perdition, helms the film. The movie is not as metaphoric as his earlier work, but it still brandishes the same kind of visual style and humor that is relevant in his previous two. Is Jarhead his best? No, but that doesn't distinguish it from being a very good film and probably one of the best movies I've seen all year."
"sparkyj","9","7","18","25 October 2005"," Amazing Film

The film was a spectacular performance of a group of Marine snipers sent off to Desert Storm to endure the life of desert warfare, while trying to confront the hardship of living so far from home. The catchy line in this film is ""Welcome to the suck"" which perfectly fits the characters outlook on the war. It seemed that what made this film different from other previous war movies was that it lacked political implications. The movie focused more on the soldiers than the actual fight they were in. The plot was a masterpiece which truly portrayed the agonizing life of Marine given through one individual soldier. The ending, however was a little sketchy and hard to grasp, but overall, this movie is a must see due to its amazing story and truly beautiful cinematography."

Being an Iraqi war veteran recently home from combat and a US marine I feel my opinion of this movie should be taken in high regard. even friends of mine from other branchs of service felt that this movie seemed to slam the USMC. From an entertainment point of view the movie was boring. Most people who go to see a movie based on Marines probably expect to see a lot of action and and combat scenes. I feel this movie was the worst movie I have ever seen when it comes to US armed forces, All US military personal should be offended with the way this movie was thrown together. Most people know the US Marine corps is the deadliest fighting force known to man, and to show a movie about a bunch of Marines doing absolutely nothing while sitting in the desert kinda makes you think...if the Marines aren't doing anything than what could the Army possibly be doing?.. the average person would assume that if the Marines are doing nothing than the Army would be doing the same. This is my opinion but I'm sure many would agree. Oh yeah, just in case you don't know calling a Marine a Jarhead is kinda like calling an Italian a whop or a Jewish person a kike. I used to be a playful term but nowadays is used as a derogatory term mainly used by civilians in military towns."

Instead, one Marine's view of a conflict is made for the big screen and all other Marine's will be branded for it.

If the produces/directors had the goal to make young men decide against a career in the Marines, they would also succeed. There was the expected profanity but the Military that I am proud of: those brave men and women who have liberated Iraq and secured freedom for Afghanistan (and who so bravely protect and defend our own freedoms at home and abroad), movies should show them At Their Best and not try to lower their morale. WE ARE AT WAR and this war against terrorism will probably last a generation; methinks the quicker America faces up to this fact the better; it's a war between good and evil and I'm grateful for the ~most part~ it's being fought in a far-away land and not in the streets and cities of America.....yet; let's PRAY we have the steel backbone of the American public; the terrorists know they cannot win against our military but they do know if they are patient that perhaps they can destroy the will of the ~folks back home.~"

""this movie will be a classic"" i said to myself the lights dimmed....the preview stated..... i was getting ready for a journey in to war. finally the movie started........................................5 min go by nothing ..........................12 min go by still nothing..................34 min go by still nothing ..............................49..........60 min go by still nothing..............................the movie ends. <br/><br/>i am not a movie critic but if you are going to show a movie with an action packed trailer. would it be good to have some action in the movie. <br/><br/>i feel that i was not the only one upset. at the end of the movie when all the soldiers are in the bus back in the state i felt whey also shared the same feelings as me. I can only see the casting wear making a movie about desert storm. all the actors are most probably excited ..right. well they were miss led as well you can see it their faces. esp at the end when a Vietnam vet gets on the bus to be with his brothers he was excited but i feel that the guys that just came back waisted their 2,3,4, or 5 years of their lives. and for what ""4 min of shooting their guns in the air....... very sad movie... great concept bad execution......."
"spanishlavender","1","4","9","7 November 2005"," Really, Truly, Just Awful
","I truly cannot understand why this movie was made. Entertainment? Pushing a point of view? Make sure Jake G. can be seen in something? Because Jaime Foxx said yes to doing it? Oh my goodness, this movie has every war cliché you can think of, they've all been done, and they can be seen again in this movie. I think it's trying to be a cool Full Metal Jacket, but it comes off as just trite compared to that film. I will say the cinematography and music were A+, but the story is so weak and pointless that it left me limp. I truly didn't care if his girlfriend was having sex with another guy back at home, or that waiting in the desert to fight makes you ""crazy,"" or how uneducated and stupid this director makes the recruits look, etc, I just didn't care. What's new, what haven't we seen it this movie? OK, well, we've not seen anything about Operation Desert Storm before. But who gives a rats ass?!! Trust me, this is an awful movie, though pretty to look at, if that's your thing."
"landon1114","9","4","9","6 November 2005"," Not too much action, not a problem
","If you're looking for two hours of explosions, detached limbs flying through the air, and blood and guts, then don't see this movie. You will be disappointed. ""Jarhead"" is not your typical war movie. Many great war movies of the past tell stories of soldiers almost going insane because of the violence and death they have been cast into. This film shows how being in war with the lack of any action at all can have the same effect.<br/><br/>""Jarhead"" digs deep into its characters as it follows their quest for glory and war through Desert Storm. This quest begins to become an obsession as the soldiers are driven to their limits by boredom of waiting for their time to fight and the paranoia that their wives and girl friends at home are being unfaithful. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Tony Swofford, a marine sniper who, like his fellow soldiers, only wants a little taste of war to make up for all the miserable training he has gone through. ""Jarhead"" follows his psychological struggle through this hell on Earth. As he and his platoon camp in the deserts of Saudi Arabia, they find themselves engulfed in pointless repetition. They patrol the open desert looking for nothing, they practice shooting at nothing and their only sources of entertainment include a wall hanging with pictures of soldiers' wives and girlfriends who have cheated on them, perfecting the art of taking their rifle apart and putting it back together, and above all, a lot of masturbation. One of my favorite scenes is when a big group of soldiers are in a screening room watching the scene from ""Apocalypse Now"" where the Huey's bomb the life out of a Viet Cong camp. The look on the characters' faces resemble a child who has just seen Santa Claus flying across the sky in his sleigh.<br/><br/>When the war finally starts, the only action that comes for them is bombs dropping from so far away that the enemy cannot be seen and all the soldiers can do is hunker down in their holes. Finally Swofford's chance comes when he and his spotter are sent on a mission to find and kill two Iraqi officers. Just as he has one officer in his sights he is told that he cannot shoot because an air strike is coming instead. His spotter, played by Peter Sarsgaard, begs for Swofford to be given the shot. When they are denied he finally breaks down in tears. I have to say, before ""Jarhead"" Jake Gyllenhaal had never impressed me in any role he had played. He turns it all around this time with an amazing performance, as does the supporting cast including Sarsgaard and Jamie Foxx as Sgt. Sykes.<br/><br/>This film shows an ironic side to war. Being forced to fight can kill a man, but not being able to fight has its effects also. ""Jarhead"" shows that every war is different but even if you don't fire one bullet, war is war and it sticks with you forever. As Swofford says ""Every war is different, every war is the same."""
"brainofj72","8","4","9","6 November 2005"," A Compelling Character Study
","First there was American Beauty, a touching comedic drama about suburban family life. Then there was Road To Perdition, a masterful Prohibition-era gangster film. And now there's Jarhead, a unique Gulf War film. I think, with his first three films, director Sam Mendes has proved not only that he is obviously one of the most versatile filmmakers around, but also one of the most talented.<br/><br/>Jarhead is the true story of Swofford (Gyllenhaal), a US Marine who endures the hell of boot camp on the boredom of Operation Desert Storm.<br/><br/>Jarhead takes a very unique and original approach to the war genre. In a sense, it conveys the standard ""war is hell"" message, but not in the same blood-spattered manner that the likes of Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down did. Instead, the Marines of Jarhead are in hell in the sense that they're bored and lonely. Swofford is afraid, but not for his life, but for what his girlfriend may be doing in his absence. These young men are raging piles of testosterone with no release. Boot camp pumped up their blood-lust to an inhuman degree, and when there are no enemies to kill, all that's left for them to do is screw around and masturbate. Masturbate a lot.<br/><br/>Jarhead strikes me as one of the most realistic depictions of modern war ever printed on celluloid. I don't understand how so many people could be claiming that the film is so inaccurate - after all, the book it is based on was written by a Marine. There is no over-the-top action combat a la Behind Enemy Lines, nor is there constant realistic battle like in Saving Private Ryan - after all, modern warfare is not exactly going to be like World War II. There is actually hardly a single bullet fired throughout the entirety of Jarhead's running time, which is going to be the main factor in causing multitudes of people to be terribly bored with the film. Let's get one thing straight: this is NOT a film about combat. This is a compelling character study dealing with the effects of military training on the human soul.<br/><br/>Another misconception people seem to be having is that Jarhead has a strong leftist political agenda. While it is certainly not a pro-war film, I wouldn't necessarily say it is anti-war, either. It really just shows war as it is, like Full Metal Jacket. And keep in mind, this is only through the eyes of one Marine.<br/><br/>Though it features no actual combat, Jarhead still contains some extremely affecting scenes, and one that is actually very hard to watch, that being a scene in which a Marine sits down to watch a VHS copy of The Deer Hunter that his wife sent to him, only to find that she has spliced in footage of her having sex with another man. Watching the husband's reaction is a very difficult task. I found myself so deeply affected by this scene that I actually felt a little sick and had a hard time moving on as the film kept rolling.<br/><br/>However, Jarhead is certainly not an unrelenting downer. There is a great deal of scathing humor, almost to the point of making the film a very dark comedy.<br/><br/>Mendes really does show off some remarkable talent here, as he did in his two previous films. And the acting...wow, it's phenomenal. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers his most impressive performance to date, as does Peter Sarsgaard. Chris Cooper is great as always, though underused, and Jamie Foxx gives a wonderful, nuanced performance, and that's saying a lot, as up until this film I found him to be one of the most overrated actors in recent memory. The rest of the supporting cast is excellent, as well.<br/><br/>Though I did not find the score to be particularly good, the soundtrack here is magnificent. On top of PERFECTLY utilizing Nirvana's highly underrated gem ""Something In The Way"", Jarhead also features Tom Waits' ""Soldier's Things"", an instrumental version of Kanye West's ""Jesus Walks"", and many others.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an action-packed war film, don't go to Jarhead. However, if you're looking for a stunningly different portrait of human beings in the military, this one's for you.<br/><br/>8/10"
"jtwcosmos","1","3","6","5 July 2011"," Jarhead (2005)
","""Sir, I got lost on the way to college, sir.""<br/><br/>This is the story of the first Golf War, as seen by one Anthony Swofford, a 20 year old soldier in the US Marine Corps. The war movie that results is quite bad. It has a bad director, a very, very bad script, bad acting and bad special effects.<br/><br/>The director is Sam Mendes, the man behind American Beauty and Road to Perdition, movies with many Oscars between them, which makes me wonder: ""What happened to Jarhead? What is wrong with it?"" I'm not quite sure. As I was watching I kept feeling that something is not quite right and that somebody messed up big time. Looking back, I guess the directing is to blame for this. There are long - too long - scenes, there are a lot of empty spaces in between, there are way too many scenes where something starts and then just fizzles. It's just as if the movie is suddenly struck by amnesia: ""What? What was I doing here? What's going on in here? Who? Me?"" and so on. The framing is decent, for the most part, but what we see is just too linear and unidimensional and the camera rarely moves.<br/><br/>The script is very poor. The story is told as if there is just one guy in the world and everybody else is there in passing. Most of the actors have nothing to do, they just come and go in a constant parade, without establishing any real connection with the viewer or the movie. Maybe the camera and the directing is at fault for staying too far and too cold, but there is something very wrong with the script. As I red the Trivia section after the movie, I saw all these character's names and I was like ""Corporal Who? Who was that guy?"" I just couldn't identify any of then except the main character. Or care less. Many reviewers have said that this is an insult to the US Marine Corps and it sure felt like it. An insult to the viewer, too.<br/><br/>The acting is quite bad across the board. Jake Gyllenhaal is usually a good actor and so is Jamie Foxx. In this movie, however, they came up short and empty. Jamie Foxx not as much, maybe, but Gyllenhaal does nothing but stare at everything around him with a bovine look on his face. I understand that much of the dialog was improvised, to give it a feeling of authenticity, but all it managed instead was long empty pauses and wordless scenes, which is the script's and the director's fault.<br/><br/>The special effects are just wrong. They couldn't light up a couple of barrels of petrol and make a proper fire? They had to make it with CGI? What kind of moronic idea was that? Anyway.<br/><br/>Jarhead. A big slap in the viewer's face. Avoid if you can. 1/10."
"Ozzy2000","1","3","6","18 February 2008"," A film for those who hate the USA and Israel
","Jarhead is a really bad film which is very fetched and divorced from reality. Riding on the ""bandwagon"" of Anti -American involvement in the Middle East it is nothing like the great war films like ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Paths of Glory"" and ""Apocalypse Now"". I have seen many reviews from fraudulent ex-Desert Storm vets saying how great the film was but its based on lies and fabrication. Shame as I really like Sam Mende's ""American Beauty"" which I know is a masterpiece but he is clearly not in Kubrick's class. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Anthony Swafford but he looks more like Iran's president Ahmadinejad and should therefore play him. Based o the book by Swafford who served in Desert Storm its a bit dodgy as you expect the only way to sell the book, as with the film, is to crap on the USA and its foreign policy as in militarist policies. Very predictable but a must for those who hate the United States. I strongly recommend this film now DVD to all young Australians as it will help them develop a total repudiation for the USA and Israel and encourage them to Join Al qaeda and similar groups and also will help break the ice for Aussie girls wishing to get Muslim boyfriends and wear Jihabs. A very fashionable film with lots images of American Atrocities against ""The Innocent"" and wonderfully symbolised images of stray Arab horses covered in oil from burning oil wells. Swoff and his comrades lust to kill but the actors unfortunately look and behave to weakly to be convincing marines. Jamie Fox is however convincing as the token African -American Staff Sergeant Sykes.<br/><br/>I gave this zero stars because its not fit for the cinema screen and is extremely boring and non-factual. However as I said those signing up for Jihad or perhaps the post modern Muslim Australian Harem will find it satisfactory to enjoyable. Perhaps its advisable to by an American flag so that you can have a party afterwards and burn it just for fun. Jarhead is Meathead."

","I have never been a marine, in the army, the airforce, or any sort of military of any country. I am just going to rate this as a movie, and not a measure of realism like many other people on here. This movie absolutely SUCKS. It is the worst war movie I have ever seen. The movie starts off with training, highly reminiscent of Full Metal Jacket (although it can't touch it). I can't help but to think of it as an ""updated"" FMJ. Then, the marines go to Saudi Arabia. Here is where the action begins... or does it? It does, if you consider a bunch of naked little boys running around and humping each other ""action"". They sit around aimlessly, hump each other occasionally, and wander around doing nothing, complaining about faulty equipment and a lack of ""action"", which is exactly what I was complaining about.<br/><br/>This movie has ass. Male ass. Too much of it. I figured there HAS to be some kind of war. I waited until the end, and guess what? There wasn't ANYTHING. As a matter of fact, not one shot is fired out of anger in this movie. Not a single one! What kind of war movie has not one person killed in combat?? Jarhead. Thats what. The only time there are shots fired is during training when that moron gets killed, and at the end where they are shooting into the air. Thats it!

","I went to see this film hoping to see something accurate if nothing else concerning modern day Marines. I spent 31 years serving the modern military, including eight with the Marines so I was looking forward to seeing it. What I saw instead is a dreadful anti-military propaganda piece depicting every type of psychotic malcontent and law breaker who ever was mistaken let into the military. This film is an open disgrace to decent men and women wearing the uniform of the United States. It is so bad it's hard to begin where to criticize without spoiling it for anyone misinformed enough to buy a ticket as I was (and I felt as though I was robbed at that). Current military people and veterans could watch this and know where to separate the childish fantasy from the minuscule bits of fact but civilians won't and that's the harm. This drivel will leave many viewers thinking this is an actual reflection of reality and it's not. It may have been marginally forgivable as a left-wing-anti-military hate piece if it had been billed as a complete work of fiction, but it isn't. It claims to be ""factual"".<br/><br/>This film bears no resemblance to any real Marines I've ever known, with the possible exception of the character played by Peter Sarsgaard as ""Troy"". Not too surprisingly he is a dedicated, calm sea of professionalism compared to the rest. Also not surprising is that Hollywood made his character an ex-con to discredit any positiveness he could have brought to an otherwise dismal film. The one light of accuracy, if any, are depictions of the Marines in ""calmer"" circumstances, training and interacting with each other. Those are remarkably realistic but they are also boring. I think that's likely where the author went astray, he tried to inject something not boring into a real story and had to resort to making it up.<br/><br/>Since seeing the film I went to the trouble of doing some research. It turns out that the author has been repeatedly exposed as having plagiarized some of the book, made up other parts that he claimed were real (he never saw anything close to combat, casualties or other things depicted) and stole a number of tired old barracks/urban legends and tried to foist them off as not only having been real but ones he witnessed or participated in (like the video of the one Marines wife with their neighbor - never happened). In short, a number of sources on the internet hold that he's a liar, thief and plagiarist. To top that off, some of the things he claims to have done in the book/film are actual crimes - felonies to be exact, that would earn him time in Portsmouth Naval Prison if they were true.<br/><br/>I think I am left feeling stunned that any organization would stoop so low as to produce such an openly inaccurate and untruthful collection of garbage as this. All of the participants in this should be ashamed of themselves."

","Greetings again from the darkness. The kiss of death for a movie is walking into the theater expecting to see a great film. Director Sam Mendes is putting together a good resume with the solid ""The Road to Perdition"" and the great ""American Beauty"". What he has is an eye for is the shot. What he is missing is the gift of storytelling.<br/><br/>Based around Desert Shield/Storm, ""Jarhead"" focuses on Marine Swofford played to the fullest by Jake Gyllenhaal. The frustration, isolation and periodic bouts of lost sanity are explored as soldiers are trained and then shipped off to sit around in the blazing desert. ""When do we get to kill somebody?"" is a recurring theme and is one of many political left wing propaganda statements attempted by the film (others include faulty equipment, protection drugs, staged interviews, etc). Sadly, the film is neither a true anti-war picture or a real psycho-probe of soldiers. It toys with both and fails with both.<br/><br/>Peter Sarsgaard is the most effective of the actors although his relationship with Gyllenhaal is a pinball that is impossible to follow. Are they friends or rivals? I would like to know when and how they supposedly got so close.<br/><br/>The true magic in this film is at the hand of the marvelous cinematographer, Roger Deakins (""A Beautiful Mind"", ""Shawshank Redemption"" and most every Cohen Brothers film). The visuals in the battlefields and desert as well as the claustrophobia of cramped quarters and protective suits are the only reasons the film works at all. We can feel the heat from the burning oil wells and smell the nastiness of latrine duty as well as the sliminess of crude oil rain on the face. Masterful.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx, Chris Cooper and Dennis Haysbert are all effective in their roles, but overall the film just is missing a soul. Very disappointing that there is no clear direction or story or plot so the film never reaches the great level it obviously aspires to."

","This movie was f**kin awesome! I could not have imagined a war movie to be so perfect that no matter where you stand politically, you totally believe in the film. Jarhead goes there! The story is so beautifully told and the message is gotten without all the politics. It's kinda sad that it took a British man to do such a thing, but major props for Mendes for doing something that no American could! I'm republican, and I really felt like I was going to come out of the theater with some anger, but I truly didn't, and I am awed by that. Gyllenhaal deserves four Oscars and Sarsgaard ten. The pair together are brilliant on screen, and knowing that they are so close outside of Hollywood makes the relationship just that much more real. Jamie Foxx wisely chose a small, yet important role, emphasizing his star power even more. Go see it, talk to everyone you know about it. It's exhilarating."
"ShimmySnail","9","3","6","6 November 2005"," good adaptation of Swofford's memoirs
","The title of the book is Jarhead: A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles. The other battles are within Swofford and his struggle to pull some meaning out of life. It seems that each time Swofford finds a goal or something important, circumstances in life take it away from him.<br/><br/>He wants nothing more to be in the Marine Corps while growing up, to participate in a war. Once in, his efforts to make a difference and his sniper's passion for the perfect kill are so diluted that he quickly wants back out. The sniper's ideal experience is overrun by politics, bureaucracy, personality conflicts, worries about his girlfriend's infidelity, and nature of the first Gulf War, which emphasized spending monumental amounts of money to fight the entire war by air and avoid losing support at home through infantry casualties and up close reporting of the Hell that even winners of wars insist that it is.<br/><br/>There are one or two scenes in the movie where things happen a bit differently than in the book, and some compartmentalized scenes from the book (mostly that take place back home) are left out, but it's extremely close, both in events and in overall tone. Many of Swofford's words are repeated in the movie's narration verbatim, no characters are combined to save time, no dialog is made up to give the movie a more comedic edge, jingoistic edge, anti-war slant, or anything of the sort. The book is a slice of life for a U.S. marine, make of it what you will, and so is the movie. Trumpets, waving flags, gory wounds, stirring speeches, and international politics do not impede or help Swofford's struggle to make something of himself, and although some may think that makes it rather pointless, in a way, that IS the point. The military cannot turn a scumbag into a hero, Saddam's crimes do not give your life meaning, being thrown together with a bunch of guys does not make you brothers, you must work for it like you would in the most ordinary of circumstances, and when Swofford gets back home, the same unemployment, family problems, alcoholism, and lack of direction that he and his fellow recruits once left are still waiting for him, and though the movie doesn't get into it, the book shows how a few of those new battles are won and lost by his former squad mates and the author himself. In that sense, some may find it boring, it certainly does not emphasize harrowing close quarters combat in the way that Black Hawk Down did, nor does it have a neat story like Three Kings, but it is an enlightening look into what impacted the minds of men in Kuwait as told by a very good writer. In that sense, it is very close to the recent documentary ""Occupation: Dreamland"" which follows an army squad in the current phase of the Gulf War, and the ordinary characters you see are very much the same.<br/><br/>The filming was beautiful, the score emphasized the tension the men felt in Kuwait while the U.S. was still implying Iraq could easily win the war (""we're expecting 30,000 casualties the first day""), and the acting is top notch from Gyllenhaal, Sarsgaard, and Foxx. The characters are entertaining but still seem realistic, and 99% of the dialog is taken from the book, which is as true and accurate as Swofford's memory."

","There are a lot of films I'm really looking forward to this year and those that I was looking forward to. For me, 'Jarhead' was definitely one of the most anticipated movies of 2005 for me, but it ended up being not like I expected. I expected it to be a modern-day war masterpiece that rivaled 'Platoon'. 'Jarhead' let me down in those respects, because it ended up being more of an emotional drama/dark comedy then a war film. 'Jarhead' isn't a masterpiece, but it is one hell of a great movie that is wholly original, haunting and thought provoking.<br/><br/>There is next to none action/gore in 'Jarhead'. That's right, it's not a 'bang-bang' war film, but more like 'The Deer Hunter' in that it has to do entirely with the psyche of the soldiers/humans involved. 'Jarhead' follows the true story of Anthony Swofford, a Lance Corporal in Desert Storm who didn't really have a good war experience. Swofford (played by Jake Gyllenhaal  Donnie Darko, Wonder Boys) is kind of a shifty, morally confused, arrogant kid who joined up with the Marines and didn't get as much out of it as he expected. He mopes around and regrets his being there (which gets kind of annoying, but I could certainly see why he and everyone else was so terrified). While defending his good old country in Iraq, Swofford manages to befriend a seemingly All-American bravado Corporal, Alan Troy (Peter Sarsgaard  Kinsey, Garden State). The story follows them through training camp under the command of the Bible-thumping hard-ass staff Sergeant Siek (Academy Award Winner Jamie Foxx  Ray, Collateral) and then after follows them throughout their course in the desert, or in the ""suck"" as Cpl. Troy likes to call it.<br/><br/>'Jarhead' has been described as a 'Platoon' or 'Apocalypse Now' for Generation X, and I have to say I don't really agree with it. Although 'Jarhead' takes place during a war, it's not really a ""war"" film per-say but an emotional roller-coaster of a drama. The incredibly talented Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) does a great job directing this, but I have to say it is definitely his weakest effort. 'Jarhead' is a great film, but it doesn't share the sheer brilliance 'American Beauty' and 'Road to Perdition' oozed. The screenplay is full of solid, believable and entertaining dialogue, but it really seems to drag during the non-talking periods. 'Jarhead' runs only 115 minutes but feels more like 2 ½ hours  2 ¾ hours. One of the highest points of 'Jarhead' besides the directing and dialogue is the acting. I never really found Jake Gyllenhaal to be that great but after seeing his remarkable and powerful performance in 'Jarhead' I gained a whole new respect for him as a performer. Jamie Foxx is always a blast to see although he really didn't have as meaty of a part as one would expect. The real prize actor of 'Jarhead' was Peter Sarsgaard. Sarsgaard gives an undeniably marvelous performance that will win him his very first Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination if there is any justice in the world. Dennis Haysbert, Lucas Black, Jacob Vargas and Chris Cooper (in a small but powerful role) also star.<br/><br/>There has been controversy over this film saying it's liberal propaganda. I'm personally a Republican myself, and I didn't find too much offensive. Swofford is anti-war but that is just his character. I'm not anti-war, but I think it's terrible. 'Jarhead' doesn't necessarily say war is wrong but it does say that it is a terrible terrible thing (which anyone should think.) War is damn dirty business, but sometimes (in my opinion) it's the only solution. Even if you think war is a necessary evil, there is no way to deny the f*cked-up sh*t it does to some people. In the powerful final words of the film Swofford's character explains that everyone who has ever been a marine in war will be one for life, because something that traumatic ALWAYS stays with you. That is very true, but it has also been said many times before.<br/><br/>I recommend 'Jarhead' if you want to see top-notch directing, acting and dialogue (if you don't mind the f-word being spewed every 3 seconds), and don't mind the serious lack of action/explosions/gore/shooting. It's a drama not a war picture, although it does take place in a war. It drags, but the good points far then out-weigh the bad points. Grade: B+ (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 11/04/05)<br/><br/>my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces)."

Thus when watching Jarhead, you will likely have your own flashbacks. Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx... remind anyone else of Charlie Sheen and Keith David? Repetitive qualities aside, I've grown to despise war movies, and not just the crap like ""Pearl Harbor"". From the 1940's to the 1960's the only movies made regarding war were propaganda films where the military was always virtuous and noble. Then came the mid 60's and every film made lashed out at the government, writing the military off as a group of war mongers. The real military, like everything else in life isn't black and white, its a hundred thousand shades of gray. If ever there was a film accurately portraying the military, it would probably be quite dull. Unfortunately, movies pointing out the military's flaws seem to draw in cash, so they keep getting made. ""Lucky"" for me, I got a free screening. I've wasted two hours... spare yourselves the time and money. Check out the Wallace and Gromit movie, you might hate it, but at least you'll avoid the deja vu."
"Devil_made_me_do_it","Null","3","6","5 November 2005"," Gyllenhaal is a convincing 'jarhead'
","Let me preface this comment by saying that I am a thirty year old female who finds the idea of war repulsive. However, I thought this movie was fantastic (in terms of acting, cinematography, location, etc.)--although I will admit the ending felt a little anti-climatic.<br/><br/>But perhaps the ending just reinforced one of this movie's strongest points, which in my opinion, was for us to understand that there is far more that goes on in any war than just killing. I have to wonder if we all have just become too desensitized (by the usual brainless, gory flicks) that we can't even watch/enjoy a movie like this that focused more on the psychological aspects of war and its effect on interpersonal relationships, than on the glory and machismo that comes with the ""kill."" <br/><br/>I appreciated all of the sly nods to some of our past war movies (Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, Rambo, Platoon). They were (I thought) cleverly intertwined with a fresh approach to the genre. The overall film ended up being much more humorous than I believed it would be. Despite what I wrote above, there are still plenty of violent moments that are emotionally marked with intense sadness and frustration. Very solid and convincing performances by Foxx and Gyllenhaal allowed me to suspend my disbelief for two hours and fifteen minutes without looking at my watch one time. I left feeling like we have all undervalued the knowledge of what it must be like to be in the ""pins-and-needles"" experience of war like those encountered by the Marine soldiers in this movie.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend viewing it at least once. Don't watch it thinking you will find definitive, black and white answers to morality issues regarding war. Instead, you will walk away with a better appreciation of the transformation that takes place when you take a young man and turn him into a ""jarhead."""

","Like I said, this movie is a great movie, but don't go if you're expecting some violent war movie (like ""Saving Private Ryan""). It has its emotional moments, has plenty of crude yet pure humor, pervasive strong profanity and two sexual scenes. Overall, I rated this with a 9/10. It could've deserved a 10 if there was just a BIT of action, but I'm not going to go out on that because I thought ""Jarhead"" is definitely the best movie of the year thus far. Some parts are abrupt, but nonetheless the way they filmed the movie makes all the difference, and the acting is beyond terrific. In fact, even if you ARE expecting a violent war movie -- disregard that thought, accept this as the movie that it is, and go see it anyways."
"theredraylives","10","3","6","5 November 2005"," Beautifully moving, personal film...
","I've never been in the United States military. Sure, I've seen my fair share of war films, but I don't pretend to know what it's like for soldiers out there on the front lines, fighting a war, going through that intense training. With films like Jarhead, I'm still not going to get there, but I can at least watch an intense, dramatic representation that has to be as close to the truth as I can possibly figure.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Anthony Swofford, a U.S. Marine who went through the Gulf War. We follow Swofford from boot camp early in the film (though briefly), to his post at Camp Pendleton, to the desert sands of Iraq and back again. First thing I'll say about him, is LORD did he beef up for this role. He looks the part about as well as I can judge. Throughout the film we follow Swofford closely, watching his relationships with his fellow Marines, with his commanding officers, and with his back-home girlfriend. Through it all Gyllenhaal is up to the task, and he displayed such a great array of emotions in this character I'd be hard-pressed to come up with names for all of them. We get glimpses of the people and places that made the man who he is, but we don't get too much; in fact he deliberately doesn't let us see these events and people. What we get is Swofford's life in the Corps. Always around is his Staff Sergeant, played wonderfully by Jamie Foxx. I had to remind myself at times that this is the same guy who won an Oscar for portraying Ray Charles; he absorbs himself into this character and he really puts himself in charge. Support is also offered from the ever-delightful Chris Cooper (who I swear doesn't make bad movies) and Peter Sarsgaard, who was equally moving in his role as Troy, a fellow Marine. It was also nice to see 24-alum Dennis Haysbert poke his head in as a Major, but his role wasn't all that big.<br/><br/>The time spent in boot camp is minimal; ditto his post at Pendleton, though we can see through these brief glimpses that he is not exactly the favorite of his commanding officers. He makes the cut as a scout sniper when it is announced that Saddam Hussein (yeah, we all know that name) has invaded Kuwait, and that the United Nations have been called to intervene. So, we're going to war.<br/><br/>Once Swofford and his fellow Marines arrive in the desert, they are literally bored out of their minds. First part of ""Operation Desert Shield"", meant to protect Iraqi neighbor Saudi Arabia from attack. It is here in the heat of the desert that the characters start to fall apart; especially from sour news back home of wives and girlfriends who have left our soldiers behind (one particular scene in which a soldier gets a nasty revelation by video is, although predictable, hard-hitting nonetheless). After a mishap over Christmas gets Swofford busted down to private, the war truly begins, but these Marines can't help but be disgruntled that they will not see any action. The war is moving too fast for the sniper, the infantryman. The soldiers persevere, though they are tested mentally and physically by the hot desert and the oil fires that burn brightly in the night sky. Before you know it the war is over, without having seen any combat, without even having fired their weapons; the Marines get to go home.<br/><br/>The brains behind this beautifully personal and moving film are none other than Sam Mendes, the Academy Award-winner for American Beauty. So going into this film, I had high expectations, and they weren't let down in the least. Much as he did with his actors in American Beauty, every one of the actors (starring and supporting right down to extras) turns out something better than expected here. Mendes is proving himself over and over to be a great actor's director, bringing characters to life like you can't believe on the screen. That's not to say he lacks the gift elsewhere; this film looked beautiful too. Even in the desert when oil was falling like rain, Mendes somehow managed to make it look beautiful.<br/><br/>All in all, Jarhead wasn't much of a war film, so don't go into it expecting to see much combat; you won't. Instead you'll get a beautifully-crafted, intensely personal film about soldiers on the brink of combat, and the trials and struggles they go through waiting on the edge of the front lines. Stellar performances by an all-star cast and some incredible settings and camera work will floor you. Another incredible film for Sam Mendes; definitely one of the must-see films of the year."
"jimi_zee","3","9","27","26 October 2005"," Movie lacked plot and purpose
","3/10 This movie was filled with a type of vivid imagery which literally put the viewer into Saudi Arabia during the first Gulf War. Images ranging from the charred remains of Iraqis at the ""Highway of Death"" to the burning oil fields brought back memories of news casts depicting the situation abroad in the early 1990s.<br/><br/>And that's what the movie does -- takes you to the war.<br/><br/>It lacks plot and purpose. It skips lightly on various issues; some which people might think is pro-war, and others people might believe is anti-war. I had a similar impression from watching the preview, and it seems the movie proved all too faithful to its trailer. It left me thinking that the war debate was all too fragile at a time like this to delve into any type of real plot; therefore the movie carefully balances on a rickety fence the entire time.<br/><br/>And that's where it fails.<br/><br/>I've seen great movies that are pro-war, anti-war, and everything in-between. But they have a point, and they make profound statements. At some points I felt this movie was about how a man changes when he undertakes the military experience. At other times I thought it was about losing faith. There was even a point where I felt a type of ""Waiting for Godot"" genre -- as Marine infantry saw little real action during the Gulf War.<br/><br/>In the end I asked myself (and my friends) ""What was this movie about?"" They were all too eager to answer -- because the movie does leave you with the impression like it just made some type of profound statement -- yet they all paused with a long ""uh"" before they could really say what the point of the movie was.<br/><br/>I didn't read the book, so perhaps much is lost in the adaptation. I'm only making assumptions here, but it seemed as if the producers set out to make a ""war film"" yet didn't want to upset anyone for fear of losing ticket sales. Therefore it tends nicely to both sides of a divided country, yet adding nothing to the critical thought of a complex situation. I'm not saying every movie has to have some type of deep meaning, but this movie by its very nature leaves audiences wanting."

When one Marine doesn't get to kill someone, he is subordinate to a superior, then cries and bangs his head against a wall. Guys talk to each other as if in a soap-opera rather than a war, and Sam Mendes did everything he could to degrade and demean our Marines. <br/><br/>How such trash ever made it to the screen in the first place is a mystery, but based on most of the reviews I have seen, it is just the kind of garbage Americans are looking for.

"joebenaiah","7","8","26","28 October 2005"," lopsided
","It is weird to see a movie with brilliant direction, acting and a somewhat compelling story and yet still be left unsatisfied. The previews do not do this movie justice in any way, since they focus mostly on the brief moments of intense action and those are few and far between. To say that it is anti-climatic oversimplifies the deliberate choice to not have a climax. However in the sense that all of the tension of the movie builds up to a moment that contains none of the tension you would expect, the movie is classically anti-climactic. There are brilliant scenes throughout, though the voice over was a little melodramatic and the epilogue seemed pointless. I feel that everyone should see this movie, because where it is good it is transcendent (the interaction and culture of the men), but ultimately it falls short of its potential."

","Jarhead is the finest war movie I have witnessed since Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. I was lucky enough to be able to see a special screening last night. Before going into see this movie I was already as psyched as can be with very high expectations. I must say...these expectations were met and then some. I am just constantly being surprised at how Mendes grows with each new film, which is tough to say since his freshman film was American Beauty, but, dare I say it, this is his best film yet. The acting is top notch all around with Gylenhall giving an Oscar caliber performance, Foxx going steady off of Ray, Sarsgard is a ticking time bomb just waiting to explode in his climactic out burst, and pretty much everyone else who was involved turned in amazing performances (i.e. Lucas Black and etc.). The cinematography was just breath taking in a horrifying way with Mendes' glimpse into what hell must look like (when the oil is lit...hold on to your seats for those shots you might just fall out in amazement). The best thing about this film is that there is very little action and a lot of character development, comedy, and drama. This movie brings you into the soldiers' life and you just can't help being horrified and yet amuse by what you see. This movie is definitely a triumph and should be viewed by all.

","What would happen if someone made 'Starship Troopers' for real? Jarhead is the fascist recruiting tool that Verhoeven parodied so effective in his most commonly misunderstood work.<br/><br/>Like ST, but with no sense of irony whatsoever, Jarhead is a lazy slop of marine clichés acted out by a bunch of pretty boys straight out of Beverly Hills 90210. The film is a crude cut'n'paste from every war film you've seen in the last 30 years, making no effort whatsoever to hide how much it steals in method from productions like 'Biloxi Blues'. Because the story as shot has no veracity of its own, its 'Gulf war' flavour is an artificial list of iconic standouts taken from articles appearing in US magazines and papers at the time, as with the clumsy and tedious scenes involving commercial airliners moving troops.<br/><br/>The script and dialogue are simply awful. The performances, well they suit the recruiting purpose of the movie fine, in so far as they obviously 'speak' to young naive viewers, as so many reviews here prove.<br/><br/>The film has one one merit, and that is the cinematography. However, even this is one note, fine for 15 mins, tedious and annoying across the whole movie.<br/><br/>Taken as a whole, think MTV music video. Pretty people, pretty pictures, superficial, but with a hook crafted to 'catch' a generation.<br/><br/>As the US prepares for an horrific war in Iran, this is the movie designed to condition a new generation of kids for their role as cannon fodder. Simple minded people could not get the point of Starship Troopers, because it seemed to show that 'war is hell'. Simple minded people do not get the point of Jarhead because it shows that 'war is tedium'. Neither seem designed to recruit people into the armed services. However, the way in which any propaganda works is in how the embedded message REALLY connects with the viewer, regardless of what the viewer thinks at the time.<br/><br/>Jarhead was made for the self-same reason as Stealth. However, it is obvious that Jarhead does its propaganda job a thousand times better.<br/><br/>For those of you that really want to know about the nature of marine snipers, may I invite you to use the internet to learn about the events in places like Fallujah. Ambulance drivers shot in the face, women gunned down as they left their besieged homes in search for water, and whole families sniped dead one at a time as they sought to escape from the city. There are 'interesting' stories to be told about US marines, but Sam Mendes is no more likely to film them than Leni Riefenstahl would have shown the true nature of Hitler's regime."

I thought Mendes was golden, but he is now brass to me. I was thoroughly disappointed from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Was there a story there? If so, I missed it.

","Forget all of the negative hyperbole you may have read in so many other reviews of Jarhead, the third film from natural-born filmmaker Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition). His latest feature may not end up being the Oscar-bait many were expecting, but it's a remarkable take on modern warfare nonetheless.<br/><br/>As with any genre film, viewers automatically compare a new entry to the films that came before it. Jarhead's opening barracks scene is eerily and unfortunately reminiscent of R. Lee Ermey's classic sequence in Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. This film occasionally wears its influences on its sleeve, but it's usually in service of the greater story being told. As one character bemoans late in the film, upon hearing The Doors blasting from a stereo, ""This is Vietnam music! Can't we get our own music?"" These feelings are at the heart of this atypical look at an atypical war. <br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal gives an outstanding performance as real-life enlistee Anthony Swofford, whose book provided the basis for the film. While his training hardships aren't exactly ignored, his story focuses more on the dismay and resentment of troops who wound up in Iraq in 1991 only to wait, wait, and wait some more. What happens to a man who is trained to kill and then never gets to fire his weapon?

I never considered this before and it was interesting to see how this affected the soldiers. At the beginning of the film everyone was laughing and chatting in the theatre. At the end everyone was silent and few people--if any--tried to get up as we sat in the dark theatre awaiting the credits.

This month, one of the first releases with that gold in mind is ""Jarhead,"" a frank look at the first Gulf War in the early nineties.<br/><br/>""Jarhead"" is directed by Sam Mendes, who is helming just his third feature film. His first two outings weren't too shabby, though. 1999's ""American Beauty"" and 2002's ""Road to Perdition"" garnered a total of 14 Academy Award nominations and six wins. Not bad for a beginner.<br/><br/>Here, Mendes gets it right again, bringing a visually stunning and genuine story to the screen. ""Jarhead"" succeeds because it's a different kind of war movie. It's not about what happened in the Gulf War, but rather what didn't happen. It's about training and conditioning for an event that turns out to be completely different from what you imagined it would be.<br/><br/>The screenplay for the film was adapted from Anthony Swofford's memoir of the same name. Swofford spent several months in Iraq during the war as a Marine sniper. The book and the movie recount his experiences from boot camp to Iraq and back again. Although this film adaptation can be a little long-winded at times, it still manages to work on several different levels.<br/><br/>During their stint in Iraq, Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his fellow troops are eager and ready to fight. Inside, though, they're shaking. They're scared of the bombs, the nerve gas and of an untimely death. It's a sharp contrast, and each soldier handles it in his own way. They must all find ways to pass the time in the desert as they wait for the ground war to begin. These scenes are really the heart of the film.<br/><br/>The soldiers do everything you'd expect a soldier in waiting to do. They train, play football, think about home, masturbate and talk about all the killing that's going to happen. But when it doesn't happen, frustration sets in. All the months of training begin to form an itch that they can't scratch. In one emotional scene, Swofford becomes so disillusioned that he threatens to shoot his own friend before finally breaking down.<br/><br/>""Jarhead"" is pegged as a drama, but it actually comes off as a comedy for the first two thirds. No matter what the intention, it works either way. There are a lot of truly funny moments in this film as the soldiers interact, but those moments are smartly crossed with some poignant, moving material. To say that Swofford's experiences were memorable ones is certainly an understatement.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal is excellent in the title role. He's showed before that he's a budding star, but his turn here  along with his much anticipated work alongside Heath Ledger in the upcoming ""Brokeback Mountain""  should establish him as a bankable leading man for a long time.<br/><br/>As Staff Sergeant Sykes, Jamie Foxx shows that his success last year with ""Ray"" was no fluke. Sure, he'll give you ""Stealth"" every now and then. But given the right direction and a decent screenplay, Foxx is capable of turning in a fantastic performance. An Oscar nomination for supporting actor isn't out of the question.<br/><br/>One surefire lock for ""Jarhead"" at the Oscars is in the cinematography category. Mendes has a knack for providing stunning visuals and his previous two films have both won the Oscar for cinematography. Although his previous cinematographer, Conrad L. Hall, has passed away since ""Road to Perdition,"" Mendes was able to hire Roger Deakins. A veteran cinematographer, Deakins has five Oscar nominations to his own credit.<br/><br/>Now, you can make it six. From the staggering sight of the burning oil fields in Kuwait, to the sharp contrast between boot camp and the Iraqi desert, Mendes and Deakins have collaborated to shoot a visual masterpiece.<br/><br/>Combine those visuals with a solid screenplay, top-notch directing and a terrific ensemble cast and you have the first great film of the second half of 2005. Congratulations to Sam Mendes for making it three for three."
"iamadamz","8","3","7","4 November 2005"," The most realistic war movie i've ever seen
","Unlike most movies, this movie doesn't make the main character into a hero, or emphasize the glory of battle. there's no American or anti-American propaganda. It shows the real war --the suck-- Although there a lot of amusing parts in this movie, it is definitely not an ""uplifting tale."" **spoiler* at the end of the movie, after all the training, all the preperation, the main character is finally going to take a shot, to take out an Iraqi officer, then their battalion leader (i think that's who he was anyway) comes out at tells them to stop, and then they just air-strike the base. After everything they did, they weren't even needed. and when the get back to their camp the war is over, before any of them even fired a shot.** I really liked this movie because it felt real, not like some Hollywood script. The movie is very well shot, and has a great soundtrack. I'd highly recommend going out and seeing Jarhead."
"patz1198","9","3","7","4 November 2005"," OVerall a really good movie
","Before I saw this movie I had been seeing all the bad reviews it got. I said well you know what i am going to go see it anyway. I just got back and let me say, I was not disappointed at all. I am pro war in certain circumstances and i feared like much of the stuff that comes from the media this was going to be another anti-war, anti-military movie. However, I was wrong. This is the story of a marine who enlists in the army hoping to serve his country but he doesn't get what he expects. Jake Gyllenhaal does an amazing job that should earn his at least an Oscar nomination. Jaime Foxx and Peter Sarsgard are excellent in their supporting roles as well. This movie is very well acted and the strong performances help give the movie a feel that you are the only one in the theater and you are right there with them. Sam Mendes produces beautiful shots in a bleak desert. The movie is suspenseful, Sad, Funny, and Exciting all at the same time. There are times when you want to laugh but you can't. I found this movie to have a bipartisan view on war, military, and politics. This is one man's point of view on a conflict that hundred's of thousands participated in. Please go see this movie. YOu will not be disappointed. I do feel however that this will not be a major contender come Oscar season."
"hungsquirrel","8","3","7","4 November 2005"," A surprisingly well-done film
","Jarhead will disappoint the majority of people who go to see it. That is not to say it is a bad movie. It's just not what the average member of its target audience will want to see. The average twenty-something male who goes to see Jarhead is looking for a war movie. Jarhead is many things, but I would not say it's a war movie. It is a raw, unsanitized account of life in the Marine Corps and life in a war zone. The hazing, the boredom, the frustration that the bureaucrats won't get it together, the fear, the uncertainty, the wondering whether one's significant other is being faithful while her man is deployed in a country he doesn't feel like defending anyway, the charred corpses of civilians, the fratricide, the tent parties held with contraband alcohol, the descent toward insanity.<br/><br/>Jarhead was a prime opportunity to get up on a soapbox and preach the evils of war and film a treatise on the politics of Desert Storm. Thankfully, you don't see much of it in this film. Apart from the civilian casualties, lamenting that the soldiers were spending weeks protecting a rich ally's oil wells while the government decided whether or not they would bother to go to Kuwait where the real crisis was, and the scripted interviews with journalists (which the soldiers interrupt creatively), the political realities of the Gulf War are mostly absent from the movie.<br/><br/>Many people are going to Jarhead to see action. There isn't much to be seen. There's plenty of humor and excellent acting (particularly from Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays the lead role of ""Swoff""), but these are not likely to impress the target audience. Couple that with a strange ending, and you're likely to hear a few grumbles from people who are judging it as an action flick rather than just a flick. Let them gripe. I thought Jarhead was an excellent movie, one I will go back to see multiple times. I'll also be buying the memoir upon which this true story is based."
"fwomp","9","3","7","4 November 2005"," What If A Fighter Is Never Given The Opportunity To Fight?
","There's a lot to love about JARHEAD, but there's an underlying current, too, that may effect some viewers negatively (specifically those that have been or are Marines.) Myself never having been in the U.S. Armed Services, I can't make those glib comparisons that others who've ""been there and done that"" might be able to. But what I can do is rate this film on its own merits and tell you why I gave it such a high rating.<br/><br/>Like Sam Mendes' other film, American BEAUTY, which delves into the depths of suburbia and all its great and terrible significance, Mendes here takes hold of a U.S. Marine and shows us an excellent character study. But this time it's of a young man's ultimate genesis into a fighter.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal (DONNIE DARKO and October SKY) is Anthony Swofford, a naive recruit with dreams of glory and medals, a dedicated American protector who takes his lumps during his early time in ""The Suck"" (the Marine Corps unofficial title given to it by the grunts). He rises to the station of a Marine Scout-Sniper along with Troy, Peter Sarsgaard (FLIGHT PLAN and KINSEY). And above them is Staff Sergeant Sykes, Jamie Fox (RAY), who ""loves The Corp"" and will never leave it.<br/><br/>As Swofford makes it through boot camp and into the lower echelon of a Marine trained combatant, he is very willing, ready and extremely able to kill whenever the order comes.<br/><br/>But what if it doesn't? This is the crux of the film.<br/><br/>I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about JARHEAD before its release, and many have damned it for a message that I simply did not see, that being the making of a political statement or ""bashing"" the Marine Corp. On the contrary, I think Mendes held back on this point and skillfully allows the viewer to insert their own beliefs (if you lean one way or the other  pro-War vs. ant-War). And that's War with a capital ""W"". Because, let's be honest, that is what our Armed Services are trained for. They are trained to kill during wartime. And each man/woman brings with them their own justifications for this (be it ""In protection of my country"" or ""Because my father was a Marine"" or ""Because it was this or jail."") This film focuses on the relationship that Swofford develops with the Marine Corp and within himself. He is given the right tools (both psychologically and physically) to exterminate the enemy. He is beat down by his instructors and built back up into a killing machine (""This is my rifle. There are many like it but this one is mine...""). He's loaded with adrenaline as they enter Iraq for Operation Desert Shield. But the days begin to drag on and he begins to wonder whether he'll ever see any action and get to do what he was designed for (sharpshooting). Boredom sets in, and with it comes resentment and anger directed at anyone within reach (even men in his own platoon). But then a mortar attack on their outpost occurs. Slow motion blasts of sand cover Swofford's face, a sort of baptism into the War. He wets himself during this scene, but whether it's from excitement or fear is left up to the audience (I personally loved that part, as it might be perceived as another type of baptism.) Then we see Swofford and his platoon moving into the desert as they witness the burning of the Kuwait oil fields. They go into this muck and the feel of the film turns as dark as the petrol spilling from the infernal wells. Are they in Hell? My initial perception was that something bad was coming. But it never did.<br/><br/>There is no ""War"" to speak of for Gyllenhaal's character. We never see a speck of enemy blood on-screen. No head splatters or bullet-riddled chest shots. The war is ""distant"", beyond his reach, and you begin to feel his frustration. Why can't he just kill somebody? (This is especially noteworthy when they are given the opportunity but it is quickly taken away.) All in all, this movie is a fantastic break from normal Hollywood form. There are no great external battles with dismembered bodies and the death of half the platoon. The battle here is compartmentalized into one man's struggle to find out what the Hell he's supposed to do as a killer when never given the opportunity to become one.<br/><br/>(There is a great feel of dichotomy toward the end of the film when an obviously disenfranchised Vietnam Vet gets on-board the welcome home bus carrying the ""victorious"" Marines down Main Street; a ""victory parade"" that the Vietnam Marine never got.)"
"imaginarytruths","6","3","7","4 November 2005"," Sumptuous, well-acted, worth seeing- but doesn't seem to have a point
","The film follows Jake Gyllenhaal's character (Swofford, who wrote the book upon which this is based) from basic training through his unit's deployment in Saudi Arabia for Desert Storm (in 1990 after Saddam invaded neighboring Kuwait) and finally through the (brief) first Persian Gulf war. Much of the film focuses on the ever-evolving relationships among the men in Swofford's unit, who at various times come across as psychopathic, sensitive, ignorant, insightful, crude, patriotic, self-indulgent, and just plain trying to get by. Swofford excels as a sharpshooter, and the film pays particular attention to his relationship with his spotter Troy (played by the always engaging Peter Sarsgaard) and his commanding officer Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Foxx, also excellent).<br/><br/>In many respects, the film is a success. Top-notch acting from Gyllenhaal, Sarsgaard, and Foxx. Amped up physicality and the perpetual potential for violence lend the proceedings an air not dissimilar to the films that it often references, especially Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket. It has a tremendously raw feel to it, from the profanity-laced tirades of basic training to the surreal patrols through burning deserts streaked with raining oil.<br/><br/>Through it all, though the characters share bonding and destabilizing encounters with one another in a manner typical of the genre, the story refuses to follow any established formula. Characters most emphatically will NOT be learning great life lessons or developing the courage to stand up to their convictions or becoming deeply disillusioned by the horrors around them, nor will they come together to overcome tremendous obstacles. There will be no explicit commentary on the war that was fought then or the sequel that we are engaged in now. It's a story about life in the Marines, in all its ambiguity and with no attempt at putting anything in perspective or context."
"MovieZoo","8","3","7","4 November 2005"," The Mother of all war movies
","The movie started too soon. I was still in awe of the King Kong trailer! MY GOD, it was GREAT! So anyway, the movie started while I was overwhelmed by the Kong trailer. I was already thinking ""this sucks"", before the first minute was up. But I thought to myself, ""hey, this isn't fair! I need to give it more time."" Welcome to the suck. What a roller coaster ride! What a welcome to reality - a reality most do not see. The movie most definitely sucks all your emotions from your soul at one point or another. Before this movie is over, you have sucked in as much as you can handle. Every breath you drew sucked in fresh air from stale history.<br/><br/>Check your political views at the door. There is no need for that extra baggage. You will be subjected to insight you more than likely never had before. You thought war was ugly? Hey! You win a prize, congratulations! The thing is, you don't know what ugly is unless you have been up close. When you see this movie, you will be sucked into all that is ugly. Despite its ugliness, this movie is beautifully done. Art covers a broad area and this movie covers it all.<br/><br/>After the first moments of the movie, it is easy to laugh because it is safe to laugh. After a certain point in the movie, when you know things are going to get serious, you are tempted to laugh(I am sure the movie makers tempt you, daring you to laugh) but you will probably hold it back because you can't see yourself being a part of the dirty jokes and wicked tricks on-screen. Subject yourself to the training and torture that these men have to endure and you may begin to see the humor. But in the meantime, thank God you do not have to go through this. Thank those who did this for you. Welcome to the suck.<br/><br/>If you go (or went) for big war battles, disappointment will be your friend. Lucky you! But there is no disappointment for the movie fan who gets a taste of reality from a padded seat while crunching on popcorn and slurping a tasty softdrink while taking in reality from afar. Yes, it is reality and it is well done by everyone. The creators and the actors all were great. It is my understanding that Jake Gyllenhaal broke a tooth when he jammed a gun into his mouth because he was so wrapped up in the moment. That moment in the movie was one of the best performances I ever saw. But even that moment is not so special compared to the performances everyone else gave. When you can remember these people are actors, you then realize, how great they were.<br/><br/>This movie DID NOT SUCK! It doesn't deserve a 10 because I personally cannot give war movies a 10, but I came close. I give it 8 out of 10 sausages."

","first and foremost let me state something. my brother is serving in the marine corps, he just returned from iraq only weeks ago. so that brought even more feelings into the film for me. so here's what a brother of a marine thought.<br/><br/>i just returned from the advance viewing of jarhead. and it was a full theatre i got there a hour early to find myself very far from the front. so far that i even got extremely shotty seats. which really didn't matter when the film started. it was some really amazing acting. jake and peter and jamie were damn amazing. the dialouge was great. and from the stories i've been told from my brother they seemed like marines to me. during one part of the film these oil fields get lit on fire, and it's raining oil and it's dark outside but light from all of the fires. some of the shots were fantastic. the characters were realistic and hard to watch. i didn't cry. but i walked out not knowing how to deal with the feeling i got from the film. it wasn't easy. but either way i would suggest everyone to see the film. it's not gloryfing war. it's showing all the emotions that go through the men that have to go over seas and do things that others wont. none of them seem like uber terminator heros, but humans. i would probably give it a perfect score. i loved it that much. and if any of you are expecting something action packed you won't get that. there isn't much action, it's all about the character interactions. it's an amazing film. i will be seeing it again"
"auntetr","6","5","15","2 November 2005"," Welcome To The Suck...IF You Wanted To See The Trailer
","I would agree with the one author here on many terms. The movie doesn't have what feels like a complete story. It is more of a ""slice of a life"" movie that doesn't answer all questions and leaves you with many more as you only see a specific period in the character's life. If I were betting, I'd say the adaptation of the book caused many a headache for the director and screenwriter. Adaptations are notorious for making disjointed films and this one seems another victim. Not that it is bad, there are many funny parts, many parts that wrench your gut if you have been through similar circumstances, and you do develop feelings for the characters. As for the people that saw the trailer and were hoping for another ""Top Gun"", they will be disappointed. This is more about disillusionment than bravado. If the military hadn't already seen the script (I'm assuming they did, and of course denied assistance) they might be hoping to see enlistment quotas go up. Not likely, unless the appeal of the scenes of homo-erotic camaraderie in the film override the scenes of hazing, ""Dear John"" letters and...well...other seriously unpleasant things. I came away with the feeling that the film tries to convey the point that the infantryman is a dying breed being replaced by technology not unlike the cowboy of the old west who had to give up the open range to settle down and drive a truck to work. All in all, I would recommend seeing this movie and look forward to the Oscars for nominations, especially for Sarsgaard."

It was an insult. I can't believe that anyone gave it a good review. It made Marines out to be a bunch of confused losers. We currently have an all volunteer force that consists of some of the finest trained and motivated personnel that have ever served. They deserve much better than to be portrayed like this.

","From personal memoirs and written with first hand knowledge of his military experiences comes a movie called "" Jarhead. "" Director Sam Mendes allows audiences to follow actor Jake Gyllenhaal as Anthony Swofford from Boot camp to The Gulf War otherwise called 'Operation Iraqi Freedom.' Swoffords' book describe the many experiences of the new Marine during his early days in Basic Training, through his desert travels in the Country of Iraq. He learns, as many young men have learned that going to war, does not necessarily means understanding why he must fight. A fact no one ever explains either. Although he and the military enters Iraq, indeed, Kuwait, to secure Freedom for the citizens of Kuwait, none are ever given democracy. In fact the country is returned back to the Despot King after the war ends. As for the movie, it becomes a fixture in Swofford's mind of all the misery the Corps bequeathes to him and his brother Marines. There is no glory in this war and even less in the country he is stationed in. He does however witness the political turmoil and double talk, of the various leaders of his own country from his immediate officers to the inept President George W. Bush who had to further invade the neighboring country of Iraq to try and finish Operation Desert Shield with Operation Desert Storm. The movie is slow to follow as is the gritty outcome of the war. Scenes from utter boredom, the childish behavior of his fellow soldiers to the emotional reactions of comrade's when receiving bad news from back home. Still the cast which includes Peter Sarsgaard, Jamie Foxx and Chris Cooper, make for good acting and an interesting story line. The memorable scenes in the movie include the burning of the Oil Wells which in itself are well worth the viewing and the long destructive mess left behind by the Air Force. ****"

I don't think I've ever seen a worse war/military movie than Jarhead. The plot had two parts - the marine boot camp, and first Iraqi war (Desert Shield and Desert Storm) and they both lacked any valuable content. I understand this movie was meant to be different than most of other war movies, and it actually was - it was much worse. The total absence of any message or anything at least remotely interesting, poor action and rather poor acting made me leave the movie theater. I was curious if I didn't overreact so I finished watching it later. It has convinced me that I was right.

Movies as bad as this shouldn't be as popular as this if for no other reason but to discourage film makers to produce such crap ever again."
"bob the moo","Null","2","4","6 February 2006"," Avoids the usual clichés and is interesting, amusing and quite different from the norm
","Lost on his way to college Anthony Swofford finds his way into the Marines where, one quick haircut later, he is assigned to be trained as a scout sniper. He quickly learns how to kill silently from thousands of yards from his target, how to camouflage and how to efficiently carry out orders. His experiences in training are not all wholesome and fun but he is easily hooked by the part of the marines that he has joined. When Saddam invades Kuwait the US moves to defend the oil, sorry, the lives of the Kuwaiti people by mobilising the troops. As part of Operation Desert Shield, Swoff and his colleagues are bored out of their minds with the constant drills, routine and total lack of action, however with Saddam refusing to back down, and Operation Desert Storm about to commence, surely it can only be a matter of time.<br/><br/>Although I have never read it, I understand that the point of the book Jarhead is that nothing at all happens of any significance and that Swofford's ""war"" was eventless and ended without him firing a shot  something that he had trained endlessly to do. So credit to Mendes then he has just about managed to produce a film that engages and moves forward while not losing this central core aspect. The film does this by focusing equally on the nature of the war and on the effect of this modern warfare on the soldiers. Most of the time the latter works well and it was only sections about Swofford's cheating girlfriend and him losing his mind that didn't ring true. Most of the time the film works best by just being a series of scenes where nothing happens  some of them funny, some of them depressing and many of them just ""there"". This worked for me because it held my attention regardless which it was doing. Occasionally it has digs at the modern Iraq war but it does this sparingly, which is just as well because none of them really work that well.<br/><br/>Mendes quickly dispenses with the ""war is hell"" genre by taking away the impact of both Apocalypse Now and Deer Hunter in two scenes that are interesting for very different reasons, and what he is left with is ""war is dull"". This may not sound like something as worthy or as interesting as ""hell"" but the film easily shows it is. It shows the men being ratcheted up for killing, only for their training to come to nothing. Several of them say about the Marines giving their lives meaning and direction and it is interesting to watch them being stripped of this point as their time in the desert goes on. It doesn't always convince though and the cracks show where you get the impression that the film is starting to cover ground for the second time but generally I liked how it worked. As director Mendes creates some great scenes that visually stick in the mind while also drawing out performances from his cast that manage to rise above the war movie clichés  in fact only the drill sergeant at the start smacked of being a lesser copy of Full Metal Jacket (although in fairness everything stands in the shadows of Ermey's finest screen moment).<br/><br/>The cast mostly work well with the characters, which is important as, with no significant action to speak of, this is where the vast majority of the film takes place. Gyllenhaal is good in the lead character and is able to convince as someone who gets pumped up with his colleagues as well as someone who has a bit of intelligence about him. Foxx is as solid as I have surprisingly come to expect him to be. He gradually takes his character from ""ho-ha"" simplicity to a point where his frank discussion with Swofford is convincing and part of a natural softening in his character. Sarsgaard has an interesting character and he brings it out well  with small touches and the breakdown that we know will come to someone eventually. Support is good although nobody really has to do that much in terms of character; minor roles from Cooper and Haysbert were reasonable but not that worthwhile.<br/><br/>Overall an impressive war film that is interesting for avoiding the ""war is hell"" clichés and producing something different but just as worthy. Swofford's memories are done justice as the film provides just enough structure to prevent it becoming dull but not so much that it forgets the whole point of the source material. Not one of the great war movies but certainly well worth seeing and yet another interesting film from Sam Mendes."
"Tanstaafl1969","2","2","4","22 December 2005"," NOT an accurate Marine grunt portrayal, movie or book
","I was an active duty Marine for eight years, '67-'75, with a tour in Vietnam. I just retired as an Army Reservist, '92-'05, with tours in Bosnia and Iraq. I saw the movie and read the first pages of the book because I thought the movie may have taken liberties with the book...not so. Swofford's story is one of total self-centeredness, not self awareness. In the book's first seven pages he writes of how he stole MRE's and other Marine's gear to have party money, so he is a thief. In the movie the small sniper Marine unit is not only left totally unguided by any rules of engagement but without higher authority control. Even the platoon sergeant is absent for great parts of the action which is totally absurd. The worse part of the book was how Swofford and his buddies, when notified of their alert for Gulf War I, rented war movies, particularly Vietnam era movies, drank beer and watch/replayed the rape scenes. This man may write well but why read him? In the movie they didn't say anything about watching/replaying the rape scenes...they just hyped the war fever of warriors."
"TheMovieMark","6","2","4","22 November 2005"," Entertaining for a while, but where's the needed release?
","Jarhead - slang for Marine. It describes the high and tight haircut that resembles a jar. The movie follows one such Jarhead's (Bubble Boy's Jake Gyllenhaal) experiences as a Marine from boot camp to training to Desert Shield to Desert Storm. We watch as the war swells from 14 minutes and 5000 troops in the desert to 175 days and 575,000 troops in the desert.<br/><br/>The Marine's labor? They wait. The movie audience's labor? We wait. For something, anything to happen. The soldiers make scorpions fight each other and they bet on who will win. They dance around naked to Naughty by Nature's OPP. I nearly vomit. They pull pranks. They wait for letters. They get bored. Very bored.<br/><br/>I hesitate to call Jarhead a ""war movie"" because it has little to do with the actual war. It focuses more on how the soldiers try to fight their boredom while waiting for some action. This is an interesting take ... up to a point. But after a while the audience starts to become as frustrated as the Marines. These guys want to kill. They trained to kill! An exasperated Gyllenhaal even asks, ""Are we ever going to get to kill anybody?"" I was wondering the same thing. I wanted to see a little fighting. Maybe a cool sniper kill or two. Just like the soldiers, I wanted some release.<br/><br/>Maybe it was the director's intention to put the audience in the shoes of the weary soldiers. If so, then mission accomplished. The problem with this approach is that it hampers the storytelling. There's no smooth flow to the narrative. After a while you're left wondering if there is a point other than, ""Hey, there were some soldiers who didn't see much action and they got bored!"" As such, Jarhead feels like a dramatized documentary.<br/><br/>I was a little concerned that the movie would be a big political statement, but it stays away from trying to polarize its audience. Any parallel lines drawn between then and now are subtle and temperate. Some guys wanted in, some wanted out, and some just looked like they had nothing better to do. One of my favorite moments comes when Booty Call's Jamie Foxx talks about how there's nothing more he wants to do than be a Marine. This scene, set against the backdrop of the dark desert lit by burning oil fields, is a great visual to behold.<br/><br/>But ultimately I never got the release or the closure that I was waiting for. Instead of sending the audience home on a high note, the director tempts us to slit our wrists at the revelation of the post-war fate of one of the main characters. We're not told how this character came to his fate, though I have my assumption, but the ""how"" doesn't matter. No explanation would dilute the depression that we're left with."

","With all the crap coming out these days like Chicken Little and Racing Stripes, It's good to finally have a good movie in theaters. For those of you who think this is a Spazy Liberal MOvie, no, it is not. BAsed off a book it is only telling the story of a desert Marine. Jake Gyllenhall's performance was even better then his in Donnie Darko! A must See if you like this kind of thing, but if you don't want to see ""Violence"" in any form at all. On the other hand, the movie grabbed me from the trailer! While at Serenety I had just finished laughing at the Doom Trailer and giggling at all the 10 year old kids ""Who left 5 min into the movie"" going ""G-G-G-G-G Un-AT!"" during the ""Get Rich or Dye Trying'"" trailer.

"THEMILTONS1","8","2","4","7 November 2005"," a very good movie
","In my opinion, Jarhead realistically portrayed the inner conflicts of a squad of marines. it provides a real grunts eye view of the war, and portrays well the madness and hell that war is. Being trained to kill will stay with you for the rest of your life, is what Swofford says. There are a good, varying cast of characters that act just like real people. The acting is good, and i think that this is one of the better roles that Jake Gylenhall has done. Jamie Foxx' role is nothing compared to the brilliance of his performance in Ray, but if that is what you expect all the time, then you will be constantly disappointed. This movie will be known as the movie that really showed the madness that the gulf war was, and how people really do react to others in a war, in a time of tension. the only complaint i have is that it is a times quite slow, but the acting and characters make up for this mistake. this is not a movie for everyone, but is you are a fan of heavy real stuff, then this movie will be good for you."
"birkaur","8","2","4","7 November 2005"," Yay- a movie where we are not being spoon fed!
","I had to see this movie twice to fully appreciate it. The first time I watched it I was too distracted by Jake Gyllenhall's ass (yes, sad to admit that even though I am a nearly 30yr old woman I have a ridiculous ""14yr old girl"" type obsession with Jake!) So, I had to go back to watch the movie again because I was pretty sure there was a great movie that I missed the first time around. I was REALLY looking forward to this movie- yes in big part because of said obsession but also because I think Sam Mendes is a genius. American Beauty is in my top 3 favorite movies, not to mention that despite my better judgment- turns out I really do love war movies. I have to say that the movie didn't disappoint, but it's not easy to describe feeling that it leaves you with. I know Mendes has been catching flack for it with reviewers but I really have to hand it to him for not caving to the current political climate and making yet another movie with an in your face statement about the agenda of the United States. Don't get me wrong, we need to have these movies and I love them too but if we get too lost in political statements we loose sight of the human element; and with out making any excuses for itself, that is what this movie does. I am grateful to Mendes that he has enough respect for his audience that he allows us to make our own intelligent decisions about what he has just shown us. The fact that 2 days later I am still not really sure how I feel about what I saw is, in my mind, a true testament to a good movie. That is not to say the movie is without flaws. For a movie that is so focused on the experiences of its characters it would have been helpful to know more about them. It was a bit of a stretch to feel real compassion for any of them because we weren't given a chance to really get to know them. There are some very powerfully emotional scenes that I found myself really wanting to get into but the connection just wasn't there. Because of this some fantastic acting never gets to go anywhere- that feels disappointing. The acting really is very good. Not just from Jake who I have always know to be brilliant (so many reviewers seem to just be seeing him for the first time- for the love of god see ""Moonlight Mile"" people!!) but also from Peter Sarsgaard who never ceases to amaze. All in all, this movie is exactly what I look for when I go to the theater; something that makes me think, something that leaves me feeling a bit uncomfortable because I don't really know what I think. It is refreshing to be given that chance these days!"
"obsessed-2","9","2","4","4 November 2005"," a really amazing study of one person's experience of war
","i went to an advance screening last night and i am still thinking deeply about the things i saw in that movie. Mendes does a fairly good job of portraying multiple political views; while throughout the film he weighs in more heavily on the anti-war side, you have to be aware that this is because the book on which the movie is based is written by a Marine whose opinions were biased from the start. there's no spoiler there - the movie opens with Tony Swofford's unhappiness at what he has done to himself, and proceeds to introduce the people who will carry him through the movie. as a bit of balance to Swofford's frustration with the Marines, Swofford's closest buddy in the movie, Earl Troy (played by Peter Sarsgaard) is in love with the Corps and wants nothing more than to do this for life.<br/><br/>even if you disagree with Swofford's opinions, there are some really miraculous scenes in this movie. the cinematography was excellent, and the desert scenes have a lot of power. it was interesting to remember back to the news coverage of Desert Storm, and compare the dry news footage of some of the scenes delivered here - true situations over which Swoff's story is mapped with such vibrancy.<br/><br/>definitely not a movie i'll soon forget."

","Sam Mendes 3rd film isn't his best film but its still an amazing film. Sam Mendes has merged into becoming one of the greatest directors of all time after only 3 films (American Beauty, Road To Perdition).<br/><br/>Jarhead isn't really your average war film with explosions and excitement left and right. Its a war film about the human condition. It examines how young men deal with boredom; with the possibility of a death that will probably never come. Its about being made into a killer and not being able to do what you love. Jarhead shows this perfectly, you can see the pain and frustration of every soldier on the screen.<br/><br/>Jarhead is rigged with so many pluses its hard to count. Things like Cinematography, Score, Soundtrack, Art Direction are amazing in this film, but the thing that Jarhead really has to offer is Acting. Peter Sarsgaard, and Jamie Foxx are sure to pick up some awards this year for there amazing performances.<br/><br/>The Best thing Jarhead has to offer is an amazing performance by Jake Gyhlenhaal. He is absolutely stunning in every minute of this film and deserves all the critical acclaim that is sure to come to him.<br/><br/>Jarhead is th Best film of the year thus far, its a must see despite some mixed reviews that have been based souly on politics. A MUST SEE!"
"bwheeler03","7","2","4","6 November 2005"," Well written and acted
","Saw Jarhead last night, in a packed theater, and was pleasantly surprised by not only the quality of the film-making but also of the story of this first major film documenting the gulf war(s). I haven't read the book that the movie is based on, but the film is very enjoyable in a dark, sad way , with some comedy that should not be funny in other circumstances, but the movie allows you to laugh and enjoy. About a marine who ""gets lost on his way to college"" and enlists, it is an autobiographical account of the first gulf war in 1992. Pvt. Swofford is assigned to a marine sniper group, and follows him through his deployment into Saudi Arabia and later Iraq. Like every other movie, it portrays how war affects the soldiers in it, psychologically and physically, and has a boot camp sequence that makes you want to run out and enlist (sarcasm). I give it a seven out of ten because of some loose ends that were probably not included from the book that might have been explained more (like the ending, horse, explosion, some others), and it seems to get a little preachy about the evils of military, but not to the extent of, say Apocalypse Now or FMJ. The account seems to be very realistic and factual, historically, probably because it was written by someone who was ACTUALLY THERE. I think that there was high caliber acting all around, and would recommend it to anyone."

","I saw Jarhead last night, and I must say I was blown away. Every aspect of it was incredibly well done. The acting, the direction, the sound, the cinematography. It was everything I had been hoping for and more. What got me the most however was the imagery in the movie.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The oil soaked horse, the black sand overturned to reveal its true golden color, the oil raining down from above, the ending ""shoot it now"" scene. All of these were done with such beauty and care, it leaves me no doubt that Sam Mendes is one of the finest directors working.<br/><br/>Right now this is my choice for Best Picture, Best Actor(Jake Gyllenhaal), Best Supporting Actor(Peter Sarsgaard) and maybe a nomination for Jamie Foxx, Best Cinematography(Roger Deakins) and Best Director(Sam Mendes).<br/><br/>Don't mind the critics, the point of the movie was not to have a point, it was to be a real story about a real war.<br/><br/>Pure Cinematic Brilliance 10/10"
"secretagentz007","7","2","4","6 November 2005"," A story of Jarheads and the other ""forgotton"" war
","Jarhead defies the notion that you need the kind of ""action"" that Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down had to be a great movie. If you are looking for a movie with tons of fighting, this is not it. Instead it is the story not of fighting but waiting and soldiers coping with boredom. There are many a scene of dismembered Iraqi bodies , but there really is no ""killing"" in the general sense. That is the point of the movie , there was no killing by most of the ground soldiers during Desert Storm , and many of them were really unsure of why they where there. This shows a lot throughout the movie when the soldiers are trying to grasp why they are in the desert, and what they do to deal with not having a war to fight. There were 148 battle deaths and 145 accidental deaths during Desert Storm , and those brave soldiers deserve to be remembered just as much as the ones in Afghanistan (the other fortgotton war) and Iraq. Overall this was a great movie that hammered home the point of what soldiers go through in war, and the grim reminder of what kind of casulties modern war causes."

I thought it was awesome, though I am a history major in college and enjoy films like this. I think that even if you don't like war movies you'd still like this movie. The actors did well, Jamie Foxx was great. You really got attached to the characters. It is more of a character movie then a war movie. So there are not tons of war combat going on.

","I almost compare it to Full Metel Jacket of our day. Dealing with the mindset of soldiers during a war is a refreshing look at war. Too many times movies are made about war and the main character is how real they can make explosions look and what not. This was a great character study. I admit it got slow at a few points but the entire audience I watched it with was into the movie up until the credits rolled. I watched this movie with my Marine brother which added some sentiment for me, but i intend to go back a few times to really soak it all in. Go and watch this movie. Don't expect to see bombs bursting, blowing people into little pieces. Exspect a movie that shares what Marines go through in protecting our great nation."
"DVLefferts","9","2","4","6 November 2005"," Sexual Deprivation, and other elements of war...
","My favorite movie of all time is American Beauty, so I expected a lot from this movie, directed, of course, by Sam Mendes. Its sharp opening and initial surreally bright cinematography is reminiscent of Mendes, but throughout the movie I made the mistake of comparing this to Mendes's early work--when it in fact is nothing like American Beauty or Road to Perdition. And I think that is the mistake a lot of critics make in reviewing this movie--you must not look at Jarhead as another Mendes, you must look at it as a ""war"" movie superior to its contemporaries. Another mistake Jarhead reviewers make is looking at this movie as all action, snappy character development, just like other movies of its genre. This is the story of a man descending into anger and depression ignited by war. There are a lot of symbolic elements, a lot of themes that most people will not see when viewing. There is also the theme of political blindness, and sexual deprivation, maybe even suppressed homosexuality? In any case, Jarhead is a movie to see, and not one to just watch for entertainment. Is ""Mendesian"" in its literary qualities--irony, metaphor, symbolism, but at the same time, a thrilling and tragically hysterical movie experience."
"cyberfloatie","7","2","4","6 November 2005"," Not what I expected but still a very good movie
","I really enjoyed this movie but was a little misinformed before I saw it. From the previews I had expected that there would be some action scenes. There wasn't any. Other than some shelling towards the end of the movie the only bullets flying were during training and into the air in celebration.<br/><br/>That said, there were many other aspects of this movie that held my interest and made it well worth watching. I particularly liked the interactions of the soldiers with each other and watching the bonds form between them. I kept waiting for the final battle that would cement their relationships knowing that once they had been through it and shed some blood, they would be brothers for life. That moment never comes.<br/><br/>The movie theater was virtually silent as the credits rolled which was the complete opposite of the buzz and anticipation that was there before the movie started. While a bit sobered about what the war was really like for the marines, at least I didn't feel sick after watching it the way I did with Traffic or Lord of War.<br/><br/>For those of you with easily offended sensibilities: The intent of the movie was to portray what it was like for the men on the ground. It shows what soldiers do to pass the time when there are no women around and death could come at any moment. While tamed down a bit for us civilians, it will offend anyone who is uncomfortable with swearing, sexual innuendo and explicit sexual content. This is not a movie you should watch.<br/><br/>Ironically, I found the graphic content of the movie a bit refreshing as well. I have become accustomed to the news and the daily footage of the war in Iraq. This movie brought back a bit of the reality our men and women face on a daily basis and renewed my appreciation for their efforts and sacrifice."
"epp678","9","2","4","6 November 2005"," The First 21st Century War Film
","I must say, as a fan of Anthony Swofford's book and of Sam Mendes, I have been waiting for Jarhead all year. The early reviews did not dishearten me, however, because many of them shared criticisms I had heard about the book (e.g., lack of a plot, etc.).<br/><br/>I saw Jarhead last night, and I realized that most of the critics are criticizing what the movie is not rather than what it is. These are a select group of STAs (and I do not think this is representative of everyone's Gulf War experience, just Anthony Swofford and we are watching the film through HIS eyes) weened on Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket who have developed a thirst for the ""Sh*t"" and a kill. And the '91 Gulf War was NOT Vietnam, but it was as Swofford says ""his war."" This situation fosters the development of the characters, and is exacerbated by Chris Cooper's character, a Lt. Col. cut in the mold you would find in Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket who give Swoff and Troy hope that their war-time fantasies may come to pass, only to come up empty.<br/><br/>And no, this is not a political film, but then what requirement is there that a war film should be political? It is a film about a war that barely happened, as George Clooney's character said in Three Kings - ""I don't know what we did here!"" Yes, Three Kings is a better movie, with stronger satirical bite than you will get here, but then again, Jarhead is based on a true story.<br/><br/>Mendes and Broyles streamlined the non-linear structure of the book, turning it into the chronological narrative, which I thought was appropriate. Technically the film is superb, from the performances, to Mendes' direction, Thomas Newman's score, and Walter Murch's editing. And no, you do not need to have read the book to appreciate Jarhead. But see it for what it is - a modern revisionism of the American War Film."

","This is not your typical war movie. I went into this expecting some kind of pro-military film, when I came out, I wasn't sure what it was. It wasn't anti-war, but it wasn't pro-war. It was just war, in a very realistic sense. There was of course a bit of the film that wasn't so realistic I think and that's the actual war portion of the film. They go into the ground war and it just ends. The troops never even get to fire their rifles. The entire war is fought by planes and tanks. And yet while this may seem unrealistic, this is absolutely what happened in the first Persian Gulf war. This tense and frightening build up that lasts for most of the film, and in the soldiers' experience, most of their time in the Corps, ends in this terrible anti-climax. The final scene of the war really conveys this dual nature of the war's end. Celebrationa nd disappointment. You can really feel the frustration of the troops out in ""the suck"" who get all this build up to kill someone and go to war and never feel the release of actual combat. While the film is still discussing training, Swoff keeps repeating ""I was hooked, I wanted the red mist."" All he wanted was to kill someone. All that training, that million dollar training, and he fires his rifle."
"chd-4","10","2","4","6 November 2005"," tension throughout
","Tension. Tension between wanting to do your job and wanting to do anything to get out of the sand. Tension between wanting to kill and being repulsed by the very idea of killing. Tension between the disgust you feel for the inescapable vulgarness of certain others and the realization of how close any one of us is to that same vulgarity.<br/><br/>The exaggerated tension of wartime is what Mendes displays brilliantly in ""Jarhead"". You feel, intensely, the conflicted emotions and thoughts that are unavoidable in the situation that so many soldiers have found themselves in, whether in Iraq, Viet Nam or WWII Europe/Pacific.<br/><br/>Mendes does such a brilliant job of evoking that tension in this movie that I had to give it a 10 even as I admit that there were shortcomings in certain areas. The movie overcame all of the shortcomings in my mind. Certain parts came out of nowhere without any warning or further development. I'm guessing that some of that development is on the cutting room floor, as the movie is long already. I'd like to see the director's cut.<br/><br/>The biggest hurdle for me was accepting Gyllenhaal as a twenty year old. That's not to say that he didn't do an outstanding job, he did. I just think that his physical and emotional maturity betrayed some of even greater sympathy that could be due a young soldier in the situation presented.<br/><br/>The emotional letdown of the ending is actually what ties one to the character in a way that could not be done otherwise. I think that it is a major part of the genius of the film."

","I saw this movie earlier tonight. I went in there thinking it would be good and came out thinking it were amazing. The cast chosen for the roles were all so perfect for each part that they played. The acting performance were also amazing. The thing that this movie does that makes it different is that it shows the story of an individual soldier. Shows his experience being in a war, and it shows how it all changed him. The story begins by showing these young soldiers going through vigerous training equal to that of what the soldiers going into Vietnam had to go through. These men were told to expect 70,000 casualties. The mother of all wars they called it. The soldiers wait for months in the hot desert that happens to be 112 degrees everyday, just waiting for when they would be called to go to battle. The day comes when they finally go out to fight, but it only last for 4 days. Our main character doesn't even get to fire his rifle. All the training and waiting for this? This thought puts our main character into confusion. He feels as if he had accomplished nothing.<br/><br/>If you're looking to see a war movie with big battles and explosions and killing. Please save your money and don't go see this movie. Go rent Saving Private Ryan or Apocalypse Now. Something along those lines. But if you are looking to really get a feel of what it was like for and individual soldier to be in the Gulf war, then this movie is PERFECT. I loved it. Definitely one i will buy when it comes on DVD."

The Cinematography is interesting and beautiful, at the same time horrific and real. Mendes is a master of weaving characters and telling just enough without overloading the plot line. You do not have to sit through Steinbeck chapters to get to the meat of the Film. I actually forgot I was alive at the time, You see so many war epics you expect them all to be WWII.

The scene with the deer hunter video tape actually happen. The Marines talking in the back of the high back hummer was unreal. you can't hear anything back there.

"evo8mr","10","2","4","5 November 2005"," Unlike any war movie I've EVER seen
","I walked out of this movie just completely blown away by how good it really was. Jarhead is the story of Anthony Swofford, who at the age of 20 years old enlisted in the marines. Academy Award Winner Sam Mendes directs this OUTSTANDING film.<br/><br/>I would like to call this one of the most realistic war movies, this side of The Great Raid. If most of you guys have seen the movie Three Kings, this would be the other side of that movie. Jarhead isn't any traditional war movie most people will see. It focuses on the soldiers instead of the war, giving it one of the most unsettling effects you will experience.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Anthony Swofford, a person who enters the marines as a normal guy with depressive qualities surrounding him. Gyllenhaal gives an Academy Award caliber performance because what he went through in the corps changed him completely. Gyllenhaal shows his emotional range, he's an emotional roller-coaster in this movie, and what he is in the end is nothing short of breath taking. Swofford walks in the corps not wanting to be there, but that all changes in the end.<br/><br/>Peter Sarsgaard plays CPL Alan Troy, Swofford's best friend and staff corporal. Sarsgaard gives his most complete performance in this movie, stepping his skills up for director Sam Mendes. You can count on an Oscar nomination for Sarsgaard, and I will be deeply surprised if he doesn't get one for this movie.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx plays Staff Sgt Sykes, a family man who is DEEPLY faithful to the corps. You can see it in his every move, and even Foxx even states that he loves his job.<br/><br/>This movie shows us people that war isn't as glorified as we think it is from all that influence us. This is still certainly a war movie, because the war itself is present in all the scenes, yet it gives us a realistic look at what REALLY goes on in a war. You can count on some Academy Award nominations for this movie as well, for picture, supporting actor, director, cinematography and editing at the least.<br/><br/>This movie is a masterpiece, 10/10."

I'll continue the praise of the cinematography but I will also throw in that the soundtrack was pretty solid too. I liked it-and I judged it harshly.

"rockoutwithme","8","2","4","5 November 2005"," A film about a war, and wars in general.
","""Jarhead"" ultimately operates as a movie with many messages, some of them stated quite plainly and others deeply embedded in the story of the characters. Don't confuse this with movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Black Hawk Down""-- this film does not glorify war in some roundabout way. Like ""Three Kings"" before it, ""Jarhead"" instead presents combat in a completely unique light, as only a sniper struggling in a high tech war could see it. His introspective, often silent observations drive the story about a group of eight elite marine snipers who spend nearly 130 some-odd days in Iraq. As Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) explains, it is at the same time a war that for him lasts four days. The impact it leaves behind however, is immeasurable.<br/><br/>A character that downright denies the audience much insight into his past with a bold and direct statement immediately in the first 5 minutes of the film, we are presented with the nearly clean slate of Swofford, who initially wants genuinely to serve his country, despite the jokes about merely ""getting lost on the way to college"". <br/><br/>He was not recruited, he reads Camus, and that's about all we're given. His character evolves afterwords into a realistic portrayal of a kid trying very hard to make sense of what is being thrown at him by the war as fatigues unique to the desert (as well as the more familiar stresses like that of the girl friend left behind) wear him down. Boredom and uselessness make him question his purpose in the war, and more importantly the role of the war in his life.<br/><br/>Using Swofford and the men in his unit, Sam Mendes (director of ""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition"") masterfully presents a bleak at the same time violently vibrant portrait of youthful enthusiasm and pop culture-- where young soldiers refer continually to other films about war and try to act like the heroes portrayed in those films. Amidst beautifully stylized shots of blazing oil fires, friendly fire, and smoldering wreckage Mendes manages to make the sprawling desert as expressive as the period piece journey in ""Perdition"" or the home wrought with conflict in ""Amercian Beauty"" . <br/><br/>With strong supporting performances by both Peter Sarsgaard and Chris Cooper that that blend vulgar humor and sometimes smart, contemplative dialogue, the film makes a bold statement about the nature of war, as well as the place of war in today's society. As Swofford says in the closing scenes, ""Every war is different, every war is the same."""

Their performances alone is enough to make the movie good, but the directing and the effects also bring the movie full circle. The characters are all well rounded, and relationships formed throughout the movie give the audience a sense of understanding.

","""Jarhead"" follows the story of Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal), a U.S. Marine Corps private who is sent to Kuwait during the Gulf War in 1989. Prefaced by about 30 minutes of Swofford during his basic training and sniper training, ""Jarhead"" explores the emotional implications of war and the chaos which not only surrounds the soldiers but his soul as well.<br/><br/>The best aspect of ""Jarhead"" is the acting, which is the most important part of a movie that was made for the purpose of showing the physical and, more importantly, the mental tolls of war. Jamie Foxx plays a spectacular role as Staff Sgt. Sykes, a leader who seems to care more about his soldiers than about the war (but he'll be damned if he ever shows that). Sykes is a complex character, which seems to contrast perfectly with Swofford, who seems to be a one-dimensional figure on paper. But to truly see who Swofford is, you have to look deeper to discover a man so torn by his personal life that he seems to lose his sanity at the least harmful times, but gathers it once again when he is needed. This makes for a wonderful relationship between the two characters.<br/><br/>The supporting characters all seem to rely on their fellow jarhead Swofford to not only carry their excess baggage, but to also overshadow their weaknesses with his overwhelming brashness. At heart, Swofford is an amazingly generous man but is at the same time deeply disturbed.<br/><br/>The story is formulaic and is very similar to that of ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Platoon"". This, however, takes away just about nothing from the movie because the main focus is the complexity of the characters, which is done so well that the viewer will seem to think that the movie is totally original. The visuals are stunning as well. Seemingly endless miles of burning oil wells, bombs falling on desert sands that stretch for miles and miles, the visual insignificance of soldiers in the vast climate. It's all there for you to enjoy. And enjoy you will."

","This movie is a terrific depiction of the frustration of waiting for something to happen that you have been intensely preparing for. At times hilarious, at times horrifying, ""Jarhead"" brings the daily life of a soldier into clear focus. The desert is a character on its own, with a horizon of bleakness that is disheartening. The film is so washed-out you can feel the heat, which builds the anxiety and boredom levels for the characters. The scenes of the burning oil wells are devastating, the rain of oil crushing, but you understand the staff sergeant when he lovingly says nowhere else could you see such things but in the Marines. ""Jarhead"" is well-made and well-acted, and definitely worth seeing."

","Excellent movie/casting. But it's not a political, pro/anti-war movie. Its view of the Corps is amoral.<br/><br/>But it does appear to be making a judgment in the climactic scene at the airport tower.<br/><br/>The two major players aren't individuals, but rather the ground forces and air power--the latter being mostly off screen and which the movie apparently takes a dim view of, at least in that situation. The Gulf War was the first, and maybe last, war almost exclusively fought and won by air power.<br/><br/>The Iraq war has corrected that. And for those who believe these wars were for oil, why did we leave Iraq and Kuait then? Why aren't we taking the oil from Iraq now? Over the years, that's been one of the most absurd, knee jerk responses on the approved talking points list."

"Pen84guins","9","2","4","5 November 2005"," Account of Anthony Swofford's experience in the Gulf War and what it was like to be a Jarhead.
","All war movies are the same. All war movies are different.<br/><br/>When I saw the commercial for Jarhead on TV, I was immediately interested. It was obviously a war movie, so that caught my interest; it had a good song (Jesus Walks by Kanye West) that caught my interest, and it seemed like it had a great cast (Jake Gyllenhall, Jamie Foxx), so that caught my interest as well. Hmmm, I guess I am very easy to manipulate.<br/><br/>Anyway, I walked into the theater realizing that I really had no idea what this movie was about. I knew it was based on a book by Anthony Swofford about his experiences in the Gulf War, but that's really it.<br/><br/>I couldn't stop laughing throughout the first forty five minutes. The whole movie had funny parts, but the first forty five minutes was hilarious. It's pretty much just all about Swofford joining the Marines and getting treated like garbage.<br/><br/>The funny thing is that even when the movie ended I still didn't really know what to think of it. But, for what it was, I greatly enjoyed it. It's pretty much just about Anthony Swofford (Gyllenhaal) and his experience in the Gulf war under Sgt. Sykes (Foxx) and his sniper buddy Troy (Peter Sarsgaard). Sarsgaard is great in this movie as well.<br/><br/>Swofford does not take any sides in this movie, or question why he is in Iraq in the first place. There is no politics involved, and there really isn't much drama involved either. It's really just all about the soldiers and what it was like to be a Jarhead.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a war movie that has Braveheart-like action, this movie is not for you. But it is definitely a very unique, entertaining movie. I'm not quite sure how much former soldiers who did fight in the Gulf War would like this movie. That's an interesting question. Oh yeah, it is also very funny, which I established earlier. I'd give in an 8/10 and I'd recommend this movie to any one.<br/><br/>Welcome to The Suck."
"mn8335","7","2","4","5 November 2005"," What's the Purpose?
","This review does not reveal any plot points, but does mention specific scenes which persons who have not seen the movie may not wish to have revealed.<br/><br/>I noticed that this film will either appeal to your sensibilities as a provocative and philosophical art-film, or you won't see the point and walk out halfway through after hearing your share of curse words and seeing graphic sexual sequences.<br/><br/>The person in the seat next to me asked, ""Does this movie have a point?"" just beyond the halfway mark. I will say this was a valid inquiry. The first part of the film has some great comic relief and one-liners that you are intrigued enough to think this will be a great shoot-em-up, testosterone-filled war flick to show the superiority of the US military might. The second part of the film seems to trail off, but I think that *was* the point. Young men go into the military having idealized versions of what they expect to encounter when they are sent off to fight. Case in point: the screening of Deer Hunter where the marines are chanting and shouting and cheering at helicopters sweeping in over the ocean. But the realities of being shipped halfway across the world only to combat boredom and see little or no real action is anti-climactic at best. This is how the viewer is left, but it ties you in more deeply with the characters.<br/><br/>I believe this film is a real depiction of a soldier's life. You train, you work, you believe so deeply in something, but when the time comes to perform, that is taken from you... and then what? What was the purpose in all the struggle and sacrifice? This is the point that the book's author, Anthony Swofford, and the movie's director, Sam Mendes, adeptly point out. The motto, ""Without me, my rifle is nothing; without my rifle, I am nothing"" is the basis for this poignant look at a young man's decision to enlist in the military. Is he really nothing without his rifle? <br/><br/>Some of the sequences that not only depicted sex, but were frankly pornographic in nature were a little misguided and misplaced in the film, but the emotional connections these men have to sex and love and death and friendship and family are very real and should not be dismissed.<br/><br/>This is an important, thought-provoking film for mature adults. 7/10 stars."

Jake Gyllenhaal moves up to the A list for actors and with the upcoming Brokeback Mountain seems a lock for an Oscar nomination. The rest of the cast is perfect in a variety of military roles, especially Peter Sarsgaard, who will not be overlooked at Oscar time for a third year in a row.

","I saw this movie on its opening day release, and can say I was quite pleased with it. Overall, it gives a very real, and personal look at the way war, especially a war as uneventful as Desert Storm, can affect a soldier who has been trained to kill for his country. While this movie stays away from any political soapbox talk, it does foreshadow the present, in several scenes. This isn't the typical war movie, in that it doesn't show a lot of shooting, bombing and killing, which is good. Too often war movies show these things and glamorize them. This movie shows that this is not the case, even for hardened Marines. Full of colorful characters portrayed by equally talented actors, this movie is a must see, simply for the understanding you develop for the affect of war."

","This movie was a for sure rental. Jarhead is a war movie about how not killing is hell. It was very well performed, has a great storyline, but there is no action. Jarhead is a war movie that rises above the war and tells a soldier's story. It tells it with the urgency and pointlessness that all men's stories have, because if something has happened to us, then it is important to us no matter how indifferent the world may be. The movie is uncanny in its effect. It contains no heroism, little action, but it is good for a couple of laughs. Apparently non-wars are hell too. Jarhead opens like Full Metal Jacket redux, with Jamie Foxx as the insane drill instructor. But it belongs to a surprising Jake Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard, unravelling in the desert, turning to scorpion-fights and porn for entertainment, and eventually turning on each other. Bottomline - if you're looking for blood and gore; this is not the movie to see."

But with a strong cast, true screen writing, and terrific cinematic style, a sobering experience is bundled into two hours.<br/><br/>Let's get one thing straight: this is not a pro-war or anti-war film... and although I have seen other comments saying that Swoff (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is anti-war or anti-military, he is neither. Swoff is simply a character who is not in the right place. He realizes the depth of his decision in signing a contract with the military while in bootcamp, but he continues to play the game rather than rebel. He continues to be a good soldier, respects orders, and hopes to see some action and get a kill.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal is the true star of this film, giving the best performance of his career. Jamie Foxx continues to show us he is ridiculously versatile, and Peter Sarsgaard gives a good performance, but there's a feeling that some scenes were missing regarding his character because we don't really understand him beyond being Swoff's partner and a (generally) level headed soldier.<br/><br/>Besides laughing with realistic military humor and feeling for the soldiers as they individually deal with the reality of war, the truly twisting subplot with Swoff's girlfriend (he doubts her loyalty to him while he is way) is incredibly well integrated that as the audience, you feel for Swoff because this is simply added pressure in addition to the anxiety of facing this yet unseen enemy.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes truly shows the stark and deadly beauty of the setting and occurrences during this war."

","This movie is not what I expected. I expected your typical war movie, with carnage, killing, gun fights, bombs, etc. That was not at all what this movie was about.

Now there wasn't much ground combat in the Gulf War, and a lot of sitting around for the ground forces. This movie showed perfectly the stress of anticipation and its effects of moral and the minds of the soldiers. It also showed, to a small degree, the interaction between soldiers and their loved ones back home. <br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhal and Jamie Foxx are incredible together. If both of these guys aren't nominated for an Oscar I will be shocked. Gyllenhal portrays every emotion perfectly. The fear, the anger, the mental break down, everything. Foxx is excellent in his supporting role as the staff sargent. He is an excellent mentor figure. <br/><br/>Overall this movie, while lacking in action, is very very good.

","Jarhead is not a simple and avenge war movie, it is a movie that shows the audience the perspective of a soldier during war. How he reacts to things, how he behaves, how slowly he becomes mad and loses himself. In many ways it reminded me of ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Apocalypse Now"". The movie is based on a book of a former US marine so the audience get a small look at the reality that was going on in the gulf war. Jake Gyllenhaal is fantastic and plays a soldier who's whole point of view over the war is portrayed fabulously. Jamie Foxx never disappoints in any role and shows a great performance. The cinematography of the film in the second half is fabulous, so many great shots and dark colors to capture the fear of the viewers.

","First off I think people need to know that this is not an action movie. That being said, I love how the movie starts out being hilarious, and the longer you get into the movie, and the longer the troops have been in Iraq, the more serious the movie gets. I think that captures the psychological journey that a lot of young soldiers must go through (and in a sense a lot of young people turning adults as well, I guess). Before they go to Iraq they are excited and even looking forward to it, but when they are there, it seems that this almost claustrophobic feeling sets in. It dealt nicely with other topics as well, but these were the ones that I found most interesting.
It was a relief to watch a war movie that wasn't really glorifying and overly dramatic about being in the military. Their everyday life in Iraq seemed pretty mundane and boring (not saying the movie was boring though, very much the opposite), which I think was a super refreshing take on a war movie.

Fire simply rained down from the sky and the enemies were vanquished. And so too were the conquerors, as the saying goes. The boys in this film, and boys they are, succumb to a morbid fascination with death and killing before they've ever really seen it or done it. They all want to get that first kill. That one perfect shot. They bake in the heat and sand and oil and smoke. They come out of it different people.

Gyllenhaal carries his innate innocence and plays a deeply disturbed soldier, whose possible masochism led to his entlistment. He plays on the edge of explosion throughout the film, culminating in an astonishing scene with his friend and (incoming) superior.<br/><br/>Sarsgaard follows with another Oscar-calibre performance, and a cast that swells with vibrance. Mendes directs a crossway of violence and impotence, maximising the incredible camerawork by the amazing Roger Deakins (the celebration scene is some of the best cinematography you'll see), editing with precision and tension, and scored with another beautiful composition, Jarhead should rank as one of the great war films, as well as one of the greatest films of the aughts."

","19 November 2005. Lost in Translation meets Iraq - this mesmerizing beautiful war movie is a big version of a serious M.A.S.H. television series mini-event, an ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) without the eerily weird stuff. This is a war movie that cuts away the action and guts for a much richer, inner sense of war, the humanity or inhumanity of war, the underbelly of war that appears away from the typical blood and guts of war. No other war movie has presented war in this fashion - the inner turmoil and craziness of war without the overt political overtones. This is major series of slices of war life - from the discipline, the foul language, to the apparent inane, insanity of some of it. ""Jarhead"" avoids the stereotypes. Jamie Foxx portrays a platoon leader that is so devoid of show casing, that it's easily one of the best supporting roles in years, unless he is presented with a best actor nomination. Jarhead is an epic experience of the scenes not usually focused on in war movies. With surprisingly little blood and guts, it still has haunting, tension filled scenes that recall ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999) shot making. This is a brilliant piece of movie-making."

I highly recommend this to anyone, even if you're not that interested in war movies"

I think it just makes us realize how much more we should appreciate them. In the movie it shows that relationships change a lot when troops go over and I think that what happens is pretty sad but sometimes that is life and you've gotta move on to something better.

","America will never be defeated in a battle (any time soon) but will it ever win the hearts and minds of the people they are supposedly liberating as they did during WWII? After WWII many wars have been fought but all have been lost in the eye of the general public. This motion picture is scary for anyone outside of the US. Especially those who think of the USA as the good guys, the A-Team for the world, the country that promotes truth and justice and stands for honesty and civil liberties for anyone. This motion picture is a wake up call for all those who think that American soldiers are there to protect the innocent, to fight for a good cause, democracy. American soldiers are no longer fighting for truth and justice, they fight for commercial reasons, special interest groups in Washington define the targets. Soldiers have no moral problems in this movie to pull the trigger, they want to kill, they were trained to kill and therefore they are going to kill. Anyone. Anywhere. Anytime.<br/><br/>This is in essence a portrayal of the downfall of American moral. Any legitimacy for fighting abroad has disappeared and Jarhead is the Full Metal Jacket of a nihilistic generation.

As if to make up for the fact that nothing much happens (even when they finally get out on patrol things are pretty uneventful much of the time), they seem to take turns going stir crazy.<br/><br/>You can't blame them, and one understands that this is character-based drama rather than an action movie, but I'm afraid I was bored a lot of the time, no matter how many hundreds of f-words are dropped in (which, I accept, accurately represents the mode of speech)."

The men's desire to kill destroys any sign of femininity within themselves. By hunting down the enemy the men take their inner sexual frustrations and push it outward, killing off their enemy.

But Tony has managed to tell a story from the view of the ordinary soldier without going gung ho or commenting on the validity of why they were there.

"jpschapira","7","0","0","16 August 2007"," ""There's a story...""
","There were moments in ""Jarhead"" where I said: ""What a great movie"". I said the same thing during moments of ""American Beauty"" and ""Road to perdition"" but, as a whole, all of Sam Mendes' pictures are not great. They are three works of excellent cinematography and performances, that's for sure; but there's always something missing. I don't know how to explain it exactly; maybe it's like ""Munich""That it looks too perfect to be perfect. <br/><br/>But I believe that in Mendes' films there's an emotion problem. So many characters in all of his works, so many moving moments, but no emotion passed on to the one who's watching the film. Nothing the viewer can feel (or at least I can't), just an amount of coldness in a very beautiful world, just good-looking characters that go through very bad thing that normally you wouldn't expect them to experience.<br/><br/>""Jarhead"" the word, as Anthony Swofford explains in a typical Mendes' piece narration, is a name people use to talk of a Marine. ""Jarhead"" the film is, apparently, Swofford's (a Marine) true-life experiences in the war in Kuwait. In a precisely adapted script by William Broyles Jr. that involves more and more narration, this Marine goes back on his life and tells us there are things he can show us and think he can.<br/><br/>Played by Jake Gyllenhaal in his best portrayal, Swofford reveals his persona through his talking, and instantly appears as a sardonic and unpredictable guy, usually positive and disinterested. ""We'll be back before you can get those nuts out of your system"", he tells another soldier on the plane going to the desert; they stayed there for a long time.<br/><br/>In war Swofford meets the soldier friends: some 'latinos', a cowboy (Lucas Black), some outcasts, some sentimentalists and Troy, an unsettling man played naturally by Peter Sarsgaard. They all discuss about the girls they left home and about the family they want to haveSwofford also meets Sergeant Sykes who, for our fortune, is not the typical life- changing that usually appears in these films and that will change the life of the soldiers; and he's played by an ineffable Jamie Foxx.<br/><br/>The days come and go as Swofford describes every activity carried out in the camp, and then as it must be, soldiers fight. You know what always happens in war movies, well ""Jarhead"" stands in the middle; without too many action sequences and without too much character and relationship development. The cinematography however, as I said, is superb. There's one moment of complete silence and contemplation where after staring at a disturbing view, Gyllenhaal walks in the desertHis footprints on the sand and the sight of him are pure photographic poetry; and I said ""what a great movie"".<br/><br/>The reason why this is Gyllenhaal's best performance is because he gives ""Jarhead"" what it lacks the most: emotion. He tries so hard in bringing a little bit of true feeling to a plate that doesn't contain it; and he succeeds. And so did Kevin Spacey in ""American Beauty"", and Tom Hanks in ""Road to perdition""; and they succeeded too. It's contradictory that Mendes has directed these actors in this way and hasn't been able to give the same direction to his movies."

His book's depiction of the War and the Marine's life during the wait was brilliant and right on the money. The movie? Not quite, but still had pretty good cinematography...the scenes of the battalion moving were realistic. The dramatic stuff? Maybe a little ""over-the-top."" Some of the stuff in Boot Camp, as well as the celebration after the War ended, didn't happen like I saw it, but maybe Swofford didn't have a say in that. Who knows. I don't where they shot this movie, but the sets looked just like Saudi (especially Dhahran and Jubail).<br/><br/>It was worth watching, though, and I commend Swofford on his efforts in breaking the negative stereotype of Marines. I mean...he published a book. Pretty cool. His book got made into a movie. Even cooler. I've read reviews on here that are only written to hammer Swofford on what he ""did"" or ""didn't"" do. I can't stand former Marines who crucify other Marines, no matter what went down. Unforgivable in my book. Talk about the show and vent your anger elsewhere.<br/><br/>Bottom line? It was a good movie and anyone who saw it should buy the book and give it a read. You'll like it, especially if you're a former Marine.<br/><br/>Until then, see the movie.

"Rathko","9","0","0","21 November 2005"," The Cost of Fetishing Vietnam
","On the surface, there is little to distinguish 'Jarhead' from a dozen other war movies. You see the same first act with the same bullying drill sergeant, the same fatal 'live round exercise', the same punishments in rain soaked and muddy yards. The characters are similarly cliché. We meet the weak bespectacled kid who we worry isn't going to make it, the psychopath who collects body parts, the career military-man who loves (and lives) to fight, the intellectual, the rebel, the cynic. The rules established by 'Apocalypse Now', 'Full Metal Jacket' and 'Platoon' are all clearly in place, laced with the cynical boredom of anti-establishment movies from 'Mash' to 'Buffalo Soldiers'.<br/><br/>However, Jarhead is one of those rare movies that improves on reflection.<br/><br/>The reason that Mendes so willfully embraces so many clichés is to support his claim that all wars, like all war movies, despite the superficial differences of time and setting, are essentially the same. The use of cliché, therefore, is not so much evidence of lazy writing, but a considered strategy for dramatizing the essential sameness of wars, battles and soldiers. Swofford gives voice to this idea in the movie's final moments, ""Every war is different, and every war is the sameI am every marine, and every marine is me"".<br/><br/>The imagery of Vietnam, despite being 30 years old, IS the imagery of modern warfare. Jarhead is not the first movie to explore the legacy of Vietnam. But more importantly, it addresses the powerful mythologizing and fetishizing of that war, the way it has been reduced to little more than the pop-culture iconography of bedroom posters, music videos, T-shirts and magazine covers. In the mind of every man born since 1970, filed under masculinity, is an image of an unshaven marine in jungle fatigues, with a cigarette clenched in his teeth and an automatic weapon across his lap. The young men in Jarhead embrace the Fetish of Vietnam, reciting whole passages of dialogue from Apocalypse Now and singing along to the music. When helicopters fly overhead playing The Doors at full volume, Swofford looks up in despair and shouts, ""That's Vietnam music! Can't we have our own?"" Upon returning to the US, receiving a heroes' welcome despite having done nothing but sit in the desert for 6 months, the young marines are greeted by a Vietnam veteran. But they have nothing in common. There is no recognition, no identification, no camaraderie, no shared experience. They shift uncomfortably in their seats, refuse to make eye-contact; looking visibly embarrassed by this ugly reminder that their Vietnam myth is just that  a myth. The scene is one of the most powerful in the movie, as much for what it says about modern America's treatment of Vietnam veterans as much as Gulf War veterans.<br/><br/>Performances are universally outstanding, with Gyllenhall proving once again that he is one of the most talented actors of his generation. Mendes, cinematographer Roger Deakins, and ILM, create a visually stunning, and often surreal, environment. Several scenes are breathtaking and are fine examples of how the successful collaboration of filmmakers and digital artists can attain a level of real artistry.<br/><br/>Jarhead, while at times lacking focus and direction (much like the war it represents), is a brilliant and fascinating addition to an often clichéd genre. I don't know whether the movie's themes are explored with the same depth in the book, but it should not be so surprising that such insight into a very American condition should come from an English director. The British have long dealt with the repercussions of fading power and a dying empire, and it often takes a foreigner to shed new light on an issue so close to home. Whether the Academy will welcome such insight awaits to be seen."

","I think that this movie will get a higher rating when it comes out on DVD. It is a well done movie, not Mendes best, but who can beat American Beauty (No one in 1999)? Gylenhall, Sarsgaard,and Foxx are at the top of their games in the acting business. I wish more of Chris Cooper was in their, because he was a real hard ass. However, this film has great direction, acting, and a very honest story, which unfortunately was it's downfall. It was smart to advertise this film as an action film, but very dishonest to the viewers. Who won't see a war flick that's littered with stars like these? However, it's honesty makes this film all the better. It's a downer, but some things are meant to be that way. If I could give this an 8.5 rating I would, but since a nine is too great, I'll have to settle for an 8. However, this one is worth seeing, and I expect it will be nominated for plenty of Golden Globes and I'm predicting 7 Academy Nominations (Picture, Director, 2 Supporting Acting (Foxx and Sarsgaard), Costumes, Adapted Screenplay, and cinematography). Their could be a nomination for Gylenhall, but Brokeback mountain should do that for him. Crash is the only other film better this year.

Very similar to the basis of Kevin Spacey's character in American Beauty; Swoffard is just trying to live his own life in the incredibly screwed up world surrounding him. The film focuses more on the interpersonal relationships surrounding Swoffard as opposed to any political motivations behind the war; however the film is still packed with enough ""action"" to keep a less intellectually inclined viewer entertained.

"avrajsandhu","5","9","35","27 October 2005"," Severely disappointing
","Got to catch a sneak preview of my film through my school. So stood in line for more than hour (with 300 other people) to get to watch Jarhead (the movie was followed by a Q&A with he author of the book).<br/><br/>A severely disappointing film, I must say. With a director like Mendes, and a cast of Gylenhaal, Cooper (woefully underused) and Foxx, and great looking trailer, how could this film go wrong? The movie starts off great enough. Great voice-over by Gylenhaal, the beginning of the film is funny, gritty and engaging. But once they head to the desert...<br/><br/>The character of Sarsgaard is just plain strange. No idea what is making him tick, and his personality changes just too many times over the course of the movie, and his character's final denouement is a bit of a letdown. Foxx is put to great use here. He plays his role very well (as usual), putting in the right amount of attitude his role requires. Cooper is barely on screen for five minutes, and is utterly wasted. (You can catch most of his screen time by just watching the trailer). Finally, Gylenhaal is good. He manages to put in the frustration and trigger-lust that his character needs to show. <br/><br/>But the first and last words of the movie (he story about the soldier) simply do not resonate. they might be true in most other war movies. But in this movie, which tries to be the anti-War movie, the line rings hollow. But the movie itself has no goal, no aim, no direction. The movie moves from one scene to another without any regard for the previous one, and the impact that Mendes so brutally delivered in each and every scene in American Beauty, is sorely missing. Some scenes are just present to shock you, others to provide a great looking shot. An example is the dream sequence featuring 'Something in the way' by Nirvana. A great song, a great concept for a shot, but it just doesn't click. No impact whatsoever. <br/><br/>Finally, the movie can't decide whether to be a political movie, a war movie, a statement against war, a statement about boredom, and finally an ineffective muddle of the lot.The entire film pretty much just looks like a setup for the trailer. So save yourself a few bucks and just go watch the trailer another time."

","Wow, read the book, saw the movie, its unbelievable how the liberal media releases this movie while we have soldiers fighting and dying for our freedom and safety in Iraq now. It is in the perspective of ONE soldiers opinion. Remember when WW2 happened, movies were made to honor and show the purpose of war in defending freedom. NOW we get Crap like this that tries to show that war is pointless. No action scenes either. Whatever, move to Canada if you agree with this movies politics. Jake gyleanhall does a good job, reminds me of my cousin in Iraq now, without the disgusted attitude. Don't support this movie, maybe one day we will get a movie on Iraq that actually supports the reason were there. And no idiots, its not oil."
"pmichelsen","1","3","8","7 November 2005"," would not recommend
","When I go see a war movie I want a good plot and lots of action. This movie had neither. It dragged on and on. It contained visualization matter that you would be embarrassed to see while accompanied with your son, daughter or wife. If your looking for a movie that shows life in Iraq like in the TV series Over There this isn't it. It's rude, profane, and it drags. Hollywood could have down better. The ending lets you down giving you the feeling you get like when you see the star cast member die in the final scene. With such a great cast they could have done so much more but didn't. It is a combination of combining a few great visual clips combines with a few good lines. Waste your money somewhere else."

","I saw Jarhead last night at the midnight showing, even though i had to be at work today at 9. It was definitely worth it. The acting in the movie was incredible. Not to mention the story. It was very easy to see why Jaime Foxx won the Oscar. Jake Gyllenhall and Peter Sarsgaard (spelling on both are probably wrong) were great as well. I was nervous before seeing it as to whether or not Gyllenhall could shoulder a movie like this as the main character. He definitely convinced me of the part. The movie was the perfect mix of humor and some of the most real, raw dramatic scenes I've ever seen. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good movie. Not just a guys movie. It's my early favorite for the Oscar."
"texseabee","1","3","9","27 December 2005"," The tag-line had it right.
","This movie sucks big time because a movie about being bored is boring. It seems like a gay anti-war movie to me. It falls well short of the anti-war Vietnam story, Full Metal Jacket.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes is a fine director. But he should stay away from war movies. Jake Guyllenhall seems to be an actor tormented by having to be in this movie. And the other characters, from their lonely gay frolic in the sand, to the idea that Jodie might be nailing the wife, all suck. Only Jamie Foxx actually gives a performance worth noting.<br/><br/>So, if you want to waste your money and see a movie that sucks. If you want to be bored to tears. If you want to get sick enough to walk out in the middle. This movie is for you."
"IBBruck2","1","3","9","12 November 2005"," A promotion of vulgarity
","This movie went way over the line with vulgarity. It was not about war, but about how disgusting this group of men could be. While some men are this way, I refuse to believe that all of our armed forces are this animalistic, as the movie implies. The ""F"" word is spoken at least twice per minute (usually more) and people were shown having sex in derogatory positions at least twice in the first hour. We gave up and walked out at this point. It had the potential to be a good movie, demonstrating what happened during desert shield/storm, but the vulgarity was too distracting to be able to concentrate on the story. Don't waste your money, the movie makers don't deserve it."
"neszis","7","5","19","1 November 2005"," Jarhead - More than a little biased, but still an excellent movie.
","I just got back from an FSU advance screening that was packed, and was met with a lot of anticipation.<br/><br/>I'll start with what Jarhead is. Jarhead is an excellent movie. It is an excellent movie with poignant acting (especially by Gyllenhaal, but the ensemble is truly great overall). It is a visual extravaganza - some beautiful photos. The burning oil fields of Iraq is quite a memorable scene. It is well-written and profound. It is directed gorgeously by Mendes, but with a bit less finesse than American Beauty. It is an important movie, examining the psychological aspects of modern warfare.<br/><br/>Now, what Jarhead isn't.<br/><br/>Jarhead is not a nonpartisan film. Its pretense at being ""purely"" from a soldier's perspective is not as viscous as it thinks; it's very see-through. I'm not completely sure if the movie even ONCE touched on the positive aspects of the Gulf War without mocking it with a large amount of bravado and testosterone. The brave soldiers fighting the Gulf War were mocked as animals, as bloodthirsty, sex-starved idiots who joined the army by default rather than by choice. This is not the truth of the matter. Now, I don't believe it was the ""duty"" of the movie to depict the entire scope of the Gulf War. However, I think it was incredibly irresponsible to give a 100% negative viewpoint on the conflict, all the while feigning ignorance of the current political context (yet, of course, still using certain disgruntled soldiers as ridiculously transparent soapboxes for current affairs).<br/><br/>Broyles may have wanted to pay a bit more attention to eliminating political bias in his script. If he truly wanted to tell it purely from a soldier's perspective, he would have used his editorial license on Swofford's book to touch on the positive aspects of the war (or, at LEAST war in general), he would have shown a little more respect for those that were involved in the conflict rather than allowing them to be depicted as robots that either humped or shot anything that moved.<br/><br/>Still, I want to give a big bravo to Mendes for a beautiful film. It really was a powerful work as a case study, although it was just so unfairly portrayed that I have trouble accepting it as being legitimately dealt with."

","I tend to go fairly easy on most movies and give them the benefit of the doubt, but I have to say that this movie was the worst piece of crap I have ever seen.All this movie did for me was make me thirsty. It was over 2 hours of nothing but sand. I was so angry when I left the theater that I wanted not only my money but my time back. I strongly urge ANYONE who even THINKS of seeing this movie to decide on another film. This was an insult to the film making industry as a whole. The fact that people would act as if this movie was some work of genius and act as if this had any meaning whatsoever is preposterous. On the whole I expected a heck of a lot more than what I got. 3 years later just the thought of this movie sends me into a rage."

","Jarhead is without a doubt the worst war movie I've ever seen, possibly the worst movie period. I'm a veteran, and have a son in law currently in the Marine Corp. My wife's father is an Iwo Jima MC veteran. This movie was anti-American and anti-Marine Corp drivel, in addition to being a really badly made movie. I've enjoyed some anti-war movies such as Platoon and Apocalypse Now, as they were well made and entertaining movies, which Jarhead is neither. Other than being offended, I just could not get interested in it. The plot was really sophomoric. It portrayed the Marines as a bunch of unintelligent, partying, barbaric, fraternity types without a clue of their mission. The character development was weak, and the movie seemed very disjointed. I viewed it on someone else's DVD. I would really have been upset if I would have paid theater prices to see it."
"toby-mikelbank","1","2","5","16 March 2006"," review for jarhead
","I watched Jarhead recently with much anticipation, as we all know the subject of the first Gulf War hasn't been done justice in Hollywood yet, and I was hoping that this would finally be the one. I am also a big Jamie Fox fan as of late, and I liked Jake G. in a couple movies, not so much in others. The movie starts out in boot camp, pretty much using the 'full metal jacket' formula only somewhat diluted, with Jake G. as the center of the film's attention, and Jamie Fox, as his unit leader, and then it progresses eventually to their deployment to the Gulf. The film, while probably catching the true experience of being in the Marines in that time period, portrays way too accurately the tedium and boredom that goes along with military life I suppose. I found myself about halfway through the movie asking what is the point of this film? What dismayed me was that I could not figure out where the director was going with this movie except to continue to capture more and more mind-numbing boredom of a soldier's life. The characters are developed in such a way that no one really stands out at all with the exception of Jake G., but as the movie progresses I felt myself really disliking his character and with good reason. About three quarters of the way through the movie I started to wish that the film would pick up the pace.<br/><br/>Eventually combat does commence, but to me it was presented so unrealistically (Jake G., in his first combat experience, says a couple of silly one-liners and acts more like a serene Dali lama than scared kid while mortars are zeroing in on them) that it didn't draw me in. I ended up turning the movie off and not finishing it which I've only done twice before in my life. I wanted to give this film more than one star but since I was not able to finish the thing I can't."
"dilbertsuperman","5","2","5","10 January 2006"," Holy Propaganda Batman!! This is a commercial to join the marines.
","PLOT: two buddies stumble their way through desert storm as marines(even though they look gay and don't pass as men much less marines). They wind up being Snipers and it is no easy task to fight for freedom in the mean ol desert. You will see the usual transformation from boot camp to live combat.<br/><br/>You will recognize the lead in this movie as Donnie Darko with no hair. This movie IS watchable but it is downright dangerous to show this thing as an accurate representation of war in this day and age where we should freaking know better by now!!!! In this movie, nobody dies in a method that isn't surgical and bloodless, and therefore it is acceptable as being OK to murder in the thousands. When these guys go to war, no one gets hurt really and none of the truly brutal realities are presented. Yep, if you believe this silly flick no one but good guys and bad guys duking it out and the good guys won ..wheee. Mainly it was meeting new friends learning good discipline and it was all really good fun looking back on it..*sigh*. Fighting for freedom and never dying- good times!! Join up today!!<br/><br/>I guess these guys weren't in the divisions that bulldozed over and crushed white-flag waving civilians. In this fake war story, we are to believe there were no Depleted Uranium rounds that caused radiation poisoning for this and future generations of Iraqi kiddos. Etc... realism is NOT so important to this tale-except in safe, tiny details such as uniforms or memorized sayings which appear to be very close= it's a whitewash propaganda feel good about war flick.<br/><br/>This movie is entertaining to some degree, sort of like having some nice soup when you really want an Angus thick cut steak instead. This movie is indicative of the general march towards mind numbing stupidity that our current (lack of) culture embraces like a teddy bear in the absence of any logical reason.<br/><br/>Bottom line- there are many, many, many better war films out there yet this is watchable and accessible to a younger generation so in some ways certain people will be especially impressed with those flick. Those would be the ones that had to struggle with all their might simply to get a GED.<br/><br/>This movie is a total failure in that it doesn't really have the balls to show the true face of war, and in that pussed out omission- it encourages war as an acceptable solution since it's not really that bad and sometimes it's just a bunch of fun with the guys- nobody you know gets killed.. etc.. lame. Like I said- it's watchable but gets low points for being a deceptive piece of propaganda trash for no good reason other than who happens to be president right now.<br/><br/>Far, far better choices include: Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now, Platoon, The Big Red One, Black Hawk Down, Deer Hunter."
"PWNYCNY","8","2","5","15 November 2005"," The movie makes a point but not a good time for mocking the military.
","Below are two critiques of the movie ""Jarhead."" Now, before you take the time to read these critiques, please note this: the main problem with this movie is not that it mocks the Marines, but rather the timing of this movie, being released at a time when over 2,000 Americans have been killed and thousands more injured in a war that has been going on for over two years, thus seriously undermining the movie's credibility and calling into the question the judgment of the producers who for reasons probably known only to them decided to release a movie mocking an organization whose members are being killed almost on a daily basis.<br/><br/>""Be All That You Can Be."" That's what the commercial says about joining the military. Along with the message are images of soldiers looking sharp and handsome, clean cut, ready to serve their country proudly and with honor. And then there's the military according to the movie ""Jarhead."" In this movie, once you join the military, in this case the Marines, you have immediate license to become, and indeed are expected to become, a complete, unmitigated, unmistakable, certifiable degenerate. If this movie doesn't convey any other message, it conveys that one, loud and clear or should I say ""front and center""? According to ""Jarhead"" which means empty-headed, like no brain or no intellect, only the misfits of society become soldiers. Anyone with a brain, or with any sense at all, is doing something else, like, for instance, f----- your girl. And when you come home from the war, which in this movie lasts four days, after six torturous months of waiting in the middle of nowhere, the only person who personally greets you is a Vietnam Veteran of questionable mental stability. According to ""Jarhead"" not only are the enlisted soldiers of questionable moral and intellectual fiber, the officers are even worse - they won't even let the soldiers fight. Indeed, according to ""Jarhead"" being a soldier means using profanity, denigrating women, being irritable, being prone to impulsiveness, mocking your fellow soldier, and being a basic screw up. And the last is shown by what happens to the soldiers when the go home after their four-day war - they are all outside the mainstream of society, unable to adjust, incapable of adjusting - complete screw ups. According to ""Jarhead"" joining the military means a life of unbearable tedium and boredom interspersed with episodes of in-group violence and drunkenness, egged on by non-commissioned officers who have nothing better to do then torture their own troops with meaningless details like piling up sand bags and then taking them down - in the rain. Duh! According to ""Jarhead"" names like Tarawa, Iwo Jima and Okinawa mean absolutely nothing. The exploits of the Marines in years past are simply forgotten. According to ""Jarhead"" if you'd mention D-Day, the modern-day Marine may say: ""D-Day? Duh! What's that? Don't bother me with history, just give me my beer! I wonder if Jodie is f----- my girl? Ugh! Who cares anyway? I'm not worth waiting for."" Where's John Wayne when we need him? Where's Robert Taylor? Where's Lloyd Nolan and William Bendix? Where's Dana Andrews and all the other movie heroes that glorified the military and made the audience swell with pride at the mere sight of the American flag? If you asked a ""Jarhead"" Marine, he'd probably say: ""DUH! Gimme a beer you f-----g idiot and stop wasting my time. Who the heck are those guys anyway? And WHO CARES?"" Although mocking the military is nothing new, doing so during a time of war is, to put it mildly, poor timing and in bad taste. Maybe the war in 1991 was four days old; the current war has been going on for two and a half years with no sign of abetting, and during that time the U. S. has lost over 2,000 killed and many thousand's more injured. Let Hollywood make a movie about THAT!!!<br/><br/>""Jarhead"" is the perhaps the most unflattering portrayal of military life in the long annals of Hollywood movies. According to this movie, once a person puts on the uniform he immediately regresses to the level of a five year old child - impulsive, tempestuous, violent, irritable, acting-out, yet dependent on higher authority for direction and survival. Moreover, this regressive and pathological behavior is not only condoned by the military, it is positively encouraged. Further, this movie also suggests that once you are in the military you are no longer a part of mainstream society and are treated accordingly by others outside of the military. In addition, this movie also suggests that the military gives license to behavior that is so maladaptive that it's almost laughable. Further, this movie suggests that large armies are now obsolete as wars are now fought not for territory but to achieve certain political or economic objectives that have little to do with actually having to conquer and occupy land. Far from being one of the foundations of our society, the military, as portrayed in this movie, is little more than a depository for all the social misfits who cannot fit into normal society. In fact, in ""Jarhead"" there isn't even much of a war. But that's in 1991; in 2005 the situation is far different. By the way: What's wrong with hurrying up and waiting? Better to wait, be bored, do your gripping and go home disgruntled but alive and well than fight and die for nothing. If someone is thirsting for glory, let them rent ""Sands of Iwo Jima.""<br/><br/>Even though the movie conveys an unfair and negative message about the military and seems to have a certain political slant, this is still a powerfully compelling movie about the brutalization of soldiers who are expected to fight and die - even if there's no enemy. Accordingly, I give this movie an 8."

","I had anticipated this movie for some time, so naturally I was worried about getting too hyped up about it. I don't have extensive knowledge about the mentality of Marines, but this movie came across as being very honest about the psyche and attitude of Marines in the modern United States. It's not pro- or anti-war, it just is what it is.<br/><br/>Jarhead simply tells the story of a Marine briefly before, during, and a little after the Gulf War. The film explores war more internally than externally, in large part because it was directed by Sam Mendes. The movie consists of many scenes where characters talk about how they feel, scenes where Swoff tries to keep himself together while worrying about war, hoping to see some action in the field, and dealing with being away from his girlfriend, and scenes of Marines hanging out and acting how young men act. Acted brilliantly (Gyllenhaal, Sarsgaard, and Foxx keep the movie from ever feeling fake or dull), composed beautifully (the cinematography is wonderful, and Thomas Newman's score, as always, blends very well with the soundtrack for a distinct emotional tone), this is one of the best movies about war and the effects it has one people I've ever seen."

","I Just got back from seeing it with a friend, and I have got to say: it is one of the greatest films I have ever seen! What makes it so good is how it is very different, and not what one would expect from a war movie. This was more drama, dark comedy, and anti war than anything. It kind of felt like watching Full metal jacket, only with better character structure. This was really a refreshing thing to see a film of this type that makes you laugh with the Well crafted usage of the F word (yes, although it is used a LOT in it, it doesn't sound too bad the way it's used in this film), and other insults, and it grips you emotionally, because you can almost feel for yourself the unforgiving events that the characters must go through, it feels like we are watching the war from a journalist's video camera, it's realistic.<br/><br/>The characters were very well portrayed. Jake Gyllenhaal remains one of my favorite young actors, and he plays the main character so well. Jamie Foxx was great, funny, and believable throughout, you can't help but love his character right off the bat.<br/><br/>The movie is so awesome, you'll be loving it, just within the first 2 minutes, with the hilariously brilliant open scene in boot camp, which is a direct homage to Full Metal Jacket, which also happens to be one of the greatest war movies I have seen.

"aliceccentric","10","2","5","5 November 2005"," Incredibly realistic, historically valuable brilliancy
","Jarhead makes a difficult achievement; it portrays war, and hence politics, without a slant either to the left or right. The movie is like a photograph rather than a portrait in that it tells it like it is without adding the strokes or color of the painter. The plot line of the movie itself mirrors what the ""plot line"" of Swofford's experience must have been like. It is never predictable, it doesn't follow any movie formula, and for these reasons I highly praise it. Jarhead is not only a masterful piece of cinematography, but it is also a brilliantly true character study that allows its audience to come to their own assumptions regarding the politics of the time. Some critics are condemning Jarhead because of its ""lack of point"" or climactic delivery, however that is precisely what gives this movie such value; it is true to real life. Real life doesn't follow a climactic line, doesn't always deliver satisfaction, and often lacks a focused point. For the film to do otherwise would cheapen the experience. Jarhead is an entertaining, moving and historically valuable film that will be placed with the rest of the classic war movies. Go see it. It's worth the 9 bucks, and then some."
"mrdewoody","9","2","5","5 November 2005"," A realistic look at the psychology of a Marine
","If you're expecting this movie to be full of fighting or to make some social commentary on the current war in Iraq, then you will be disappointed. The most profound political statement in the movie is ""F--- Politics."" The only fighting consists of a few bombing scenes. But you have to remember, this was the first Gulf War, which lasted about 4 days. This movie takes a look at the making of a Marine sniper and the psychological aspects that go along with it. It has some aspects from Full Metal Jacket, but don't count it out as an imitation. It isn't. Swafford, the main character, is a sniper in the Marines. He deals with the pressures of the other Marines, the inbred desire to kill and the strain of having a girlfriend back home while he is stuck in the deserts near Iraq, thinking a massive battle is waiting. As you know from history, there were no major ground battles in the first Gulf War, and these Marines deal with all the anticipation of war with out ever getting to experience it. I think the author of the book compared it to building up for a sexual release and never experiencing it. There are several emotional and mental conflicts in this movie, which I think are excellent. They seem to be the real issue for a soldier, not the actual fighting. It also deals with the difference between soldiers who are in for a short term and the ones who are in for life. I think this is a fascinating aspect of the movie, and is handled brilliantly. So if you want a psychological and emotional look at being a soldier, watch Jarhead. If you want a ton of action and fighting, go watch something else. If you want political commentaries, go watch Fox News or CNN."
"jt1999","4","2","5","5 November 2005"," Takes your breath away... but so does a train wreck.
","""Jarhead"" is further proof that a movie's success or failure ultimately comes down to the worth of the script, and that no matter how much excellent work goes into a picture -- from outstanding performances to fantastic editing to stellar photography -- no amount of skill and craftsmanship can remedy the fundamental flaws in the material.<br/><br/>In many ways, ""Jarhead"" can be equated to ""Heaven's Gate,"" and Sam Mendes to Michael Cimino: when both directors have great scripts, they can make great movies (which does not make either of them great directors). ""The Deer Hunter"" was a fantastic film, as was ""American Beauty."" But when these filmmakers got a little too cocky, they both began churning out inconsequential rubbish, like ""Road to Perdition"" and ""Year of the Dragon"" and now ""Jarhead.""<br/><br/>With all due respect, this film has a lot going for it. Roger Deakins's bleach- bypass desert landscapes (though a little too overexposed for me) are quite impressive, Walter Murch's editing is seamlessly perfect, as always, and Thomas Newman's score -- which I'm sure no one else will mention or notice because it's so perfectly interwoven into the loud, rhythmically dominated soundtrack -- pretty much holds the whole thing together. And the performances -- from Jamie Foxx's no-nonsense staff sergeant to Jake Gyllenhall and Peter Saarsgard's raw marine recruits -- are uniformly excellent -- almost frighteningly naturalistic and often powerful.<br/><br/>That said, a question must be raised: what is the point of this film? To show the frustration of warriors without a war? To enlighten us as to the stark differences between the military and the naive, back-home military expectations? To show the brutality and angst and raw machismo of young, unformed, insecure young men in their twenties worrying about their girlfriends and wives back home while serving in the ""Corp""?<br/><br/>Well, fine -- this film does that quite well. But so have a dozen other movies, from ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" nearly a century ago. to ""Platoon"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" more recently (William Broyles' Jr's script lifts its drill instructor dialogue directly out of ""Full Metal Jacket,"" incidentally.) <br/><br/>And all of these films did so without the loud, tedious barrage of unstable, screaming young men hiding their fears and anxieties and sexual insecurities behind bellowing and hitting and mock homo-erotic behavior that grows tiresome long before the first reel has ended. <br/><br/>So this film is gonna be bigger and badder and better because it's got more""grit"" and ""realism"" than those other war films (many of which are ""referenced"" here, as we now say)? The more realism and grit the better, is that the point? Then why not focus the lens on a latrine for two and half hours? Why not show the real grit -- Marines taking a dump for twelve reels? Why not show them pissing and crapping and vomiting -- that's real, isn't it?<br/><br/>Come to think of it, Mendes does give provide the audience with some outstanding bathroom activity -- but only five or six or seven or eight or nine times. As in ""American Beauty,"" he never misses a chance to give the audience a real good view of urine, or someone urinating, or someone masturbating, or at least one or two or three or four naked men. Mendes gay? Nah! He's just keepin' it real!<br/><br/>Well, this is a perfect example of what movie-making has devolved to in the second century of motion pictures. No wonder documentaries are so popular now. No wonder ""Reality TV"" is the big thing. Audiences -- at least young, MTV- raised audiences -- have tired of standard plots, tired of unnecessary, extraneous crap such as stories and characters. What they want is realism -- and very little more. <br/><br/>I've noticed that many ofthe IMDb reviewers have praised this film, mainly for its gritty atmosphere and ""real"" approach. That's all well and good -- but I can get that in any number of excellent Gulf War documentaries, and better.<br/><br/>Like ""Full Metal jacket,"" ""Jarhead was based on a Marine's memoir. Unlike ""Full Metal Jacket,"" the script for ""Jarhead"" seems to have no ultimate point. In the end the picture gives us nothing new, nothing profound, nothing we haven't seen before and nothing truly disturbing or emotionally involving or thought-provoking (I guess we'll have to dig out the DVDs of ""Platoon"" or ""The Deer Hunter"" or ""Apocalypse Now"" for that. <br/><br/>What this film does give us, though, is a lot of noise and screaming and machismo, a mumbling, badly-enunciated ""Full Metal Jacket""-wannabe voice-over narration, and a pointless, confusing, unsatisfying ending. Stanley Kubrick, where are you now that we need you?!?"
"dc_max","7","2","5","5 November 2005"," Good movie, but copies Full Metal Jacket too much
","This movie about the toll that the hardships and realities of war have on Marines, both mentally and interpersonally, is generally well done and recommendable. However, one wonders why it had so many scenes that closely resembled those of Full Metal Jacket to the point of astonishment. It is this fact that causes the movie to lack the degree of originality requisite in a truly exceptional, unique production. The movie delivers on excellent acting by the cast, great visuals, and some riveting action. In addition, it succeeds in demonstrating some aspects of the rigorous emotional plights experienced by Marines. However, those who are expecting a deep substantive message beyond that may be slightly disappointed."

","Quite an amazing movie.<br/><br/>Certainly not an average run-of-the-mill war film, this movie strays from the norm and does it truthfully and often times painfully. Gyllenhall is haunting along with the rest of the cast, and this has to be one of the most personal war movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Disturbing on many levels, this film is as heartfelt and poignant as it is vexatious and torturous. Jamie Foxx delivers another solid performance, but the movie is held together by Gyllenhall and the other young marines comradery and dialogue. I enjoyed the ending, even though the true theme of the movie is hard to define, it is definitely worth the time and money. This was an awesome film."
"acerkc","1","2","5","5 November 2005"," Anti-climatic war film
","Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the highly anticipated film, Jarhead. I thought that the problem was not with the direction, cinematography, or acting, but, instead with the story itself. I thought the film was beautifully done, but there was not enough meat to the story. I understand that this is an accurate depiction of Desert Storm in 1989, but therein, lies the problem. As the film depicts, Desert Storm was anti-climatic. It was over before most of us knew it. While I was not misled that this was the focus of the film, I kept waiting for something to happen, just like the soldiers.<br/><br/>I guess the bottom line is that the nature of Desert Storm of waiting doesn't transfer well into a movie. One can not help and compare this to other war films where things happen and large lessons are learned about mankind. In Jarhead, very little happens and unfortunately, very few lessons are learned. I also didn't like the ambiguity of the end. What happens to Peter Sarsgaard's character? I look forward to see if people praise this movie for its great direction over the lack of substance in the film."

And just like in American Beauty, Mendes makes great use of the voice-over throughout the movie.<br/><br/>It's hard to say exactly what it's about- its certainly funny at many parts, sad and poignant at others, and thought-provoking overall. Either way- don't miss this movie. It's entertaining and powerful, and not just another ""war movie."" I'd say it's a movie about people, and how they change.

","Thank God the Marines of Desert Shield weren't overseas during World War II, lest they would have all gone mad. From viewing the film, Jarhead, one would gather the poor blighters of Desert Shield were suffering Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from simply camping out in the desert for a few months. I had no idea a soldier could be so psychologically harmed from not killing. Peter Sarsgaard's character literally bangs his head against a wall, in a fit of rage, because he wasn't allowed to kill anyone, but he was only the spotter, anyway.<br/><br/>My father was a soldier in the Pacific Theater of World War II. I'm sure he would have been very happy not to kill anyone and hang out in a desert for a few months, given a choice.<br/><br/>The film is very engrossing and shows the human side of the anti-event.

American Beauty, one of Mendez's earlier films, was one of my favorites; and I was thrilled when I saw a trailer for a drama/war movie starring Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko, Bubble Boy) ; whom I think is fantastic. This movie ended up being very good. The acting was top-notch (especially Jamie Fox's character), the soundtrack was good (Nirvana, T-Rex), and the cinematography was excellent. The only reason that I wouldn't give it a ten would be for the ending. I'm not saying it was bad, in fact it was good. But it could have ended on a higher note and with more meaning. The director did a great job of getting you involved with the characters; and showed the terrors of war without being extra gory or violent. This movie is definitely not pro-war. On top of the drama and war, there are many comedic moments in this film. I left the theater deeply moved; this film is very emotional and will make you a better person. I would recommend this drama/comedy/war masterpiece to everybody; that is everybody who would like to be part of a wonderful film."

I urge you to go see it. Well, thats all i really have to say but I'm supposed to write at least ten lines so...i don't know what to say. Jake Gyllenhall was really good, so was Jamie Foxx. I like those actors, lots of character, Jake was good in Donnie Darko. kind of freaky, but good. wow i still have more lines to fill. i read the message board review of Jarhead and the person there didn't like it, but i think everyone should see it for themselves. because it sounded to me like they disliked it because of the lack of violence. But that is one of the reasons i appreciated it."

","I like Tonys characters growth in the movie. Every character needs to start at a place and end up at another in a movie, however, I particularly enjoyed the metamorphasis from confused young teenager, to hardened marine that Jake G. manifested on screen. I love Jakes acting and every movie he is in seems to become a favorite of mine quickly. He obviously has a talent for making a character his own, and it really shows in this movie when you follow his painful yet inevitable struggle with his ""back home relationship"" Jamie Foxx really did his homework on this one also. He definitely was your typical marine, yet he brought a modern, fresh, smart element to the character that made me want to watch his every move and decision because you knew there was a reason for it. I only wish the movie was longer because in seems when I watch war movies I tend to enjoy living in the characters struggles, and feeling, in some small way, my own sense of time being stretched across my conscienceness. They did a good job of illustrating the boredom of the characters, and I am sure it was long enough for everyone else, but I truly enjoy just getting seriously lost in the middle of a movie and really feeling like I'm there with the characters. As long as its done right of course. I also thought the end did not provide enough conclusive elements and now I must read the book."

","A great movie. Excellent performances by Gyllenhaal, Foxx, and Sarsgaard. It reflected the war from a soldiers point of view very well, and evenly balanced both views of how Bush and his administration is handling it. Either way, though, these men were taught to ignore politics and do what they were told, because arguing why they were there was pointless in the end. My only wish is that we could've seen a little more of Chris Cooper, whose one scene was very well presented indeed. The writing seemed to reflect an almost love hate relationship with the Marines, showing both the honor and the bullshit of loyalty and rules. On the whole, this movie was moving and entertaining, and in a small sense, enlightening. And for a girl who isn't a big fan of masculine shoot-em-up war movies (which this very much is), I was surprisingly pleased."

Well acted, full of male bonding type stuff; if you have delicate ears, you may want to wait for network television, though! I think Jaime Fox is actually more convincing as a Marine than as Ray Charles, but that's just me. He's full of tough love for all the men under his command. Jake Gyllenhall is a good lead as the wide-eyed Swoff. Side characters are more of caricatures, but still lots of fun anyways.<br/><br/>Awesome soundtrack, and fantastic backdrops.

In one line: Boy joins military, boy spends time in desert, boy comes home. Big deal. Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx are both good actors and both do a great job, along with the other actors in the film. It is well made, just a bit frustrating to watch. Sort of a non-action film, so to speak. It is interesting to see the transition these men go through, even though it has been done before....just this time with sand instead of jungle. If you are a fan of of watching young men, in various stages of undress, and many homo erotic scenes (which I am), then you may enjoy it. If not for these things and the shower scene, I really wouldn't recommend seeing this one at all. All in all, it was an enjoyable way to spend an evening, and it was free. If I had paid for it, I would be less impressed and would suggest waiting for the DVD."
"RyanRedd","7","4","16","1 November 2005"," Mendes scores again
","Sam Mendes is going to be one of the most important filmmakers of the 21st century. His mastery of both the technical and emotional aspects of film will long be remembered. Such is the case with ""Jarhead."" Telling the tale of a young man, Jake Gyllenhall, in the role that will define him as a star, starting in the Marines during the Gulf War. The opening is familiar with ""Full Metal Jacket"" but soon evolves into it's own film. To avoid plot spoilers, I will avoid plot summary. The acting in this film is quite good, but has some shaky secondary characters. As I said, Jake is great, and it's quite shocking how large he is. He portrays rage, fear, and sadness all within one spectacular scene. Peter Sarsgaard is subtle as ever and is also able to portray numerous emotions that really connect with the audience. In one scene at the end of the film, you are shocked and feel for him as he let's it all out. Jamie Foxx is essentially the Lee Armey of this film, he's the rough tough, and often hilarious staff Sergeant who has some real depth but is wisely kept under wraps as to not distract from the essential story. The cinematography in this film is probably the most beautiful I have seen in a war film. While films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" use the shaky cam, ""Jarhead"" does as well, but Mendes is able to blend shaky cam with some truly magnificent shots. Towards the end, the oil fields begin to burn, and I have never seen something so tragically gorgeous. In general, the film is not only a must-see for war film fans, but fans of emotional valor and depth. Highly recommended, watch this one for Oscar season."

It clearly has an anti-military theme. What kind of a message is this Swofford guy trying to cast of Marines? He obviously was not very fond of his time spent in the Corps.

With characters you couldn't care about, no real tension, drama, humour etc. - it felt more like an MTV video take on army life than anything else (complete with homo-erotic shower scenes etc.). The acting was nothing to write home about either - I couldn't believe the lame Gyllenhall 'losing it' scene where he shouts a lot and points his rifle at another marine.

You would expect a war movie to actually contain, well ""war"". Instead you are fed building suspense with no climax for over two hours. This movie can be compared to ordering pizza for the sake of smelling the toppings, it's pointless, just eat the stupid thing. Why rent a war movie when it does not contain war? It's like wiping before you poop, it don't make any sense. At this point some red-neck will interrupt with this non-sense ""well, at least it was realistic"". Excuse me, have you ever seen any real war footage? It looks more like Saving Private Ryan, not jar head. What a joke this movie turned out to be. The self proclaimed ""realist"" at this point will sarcastically say ""well, war is not always filled with gun shots, some times they will go several weeks without shooting a single round"". Yeah well listen to me Mr. realist, at the end of those empty weeks there is gun fire. The suspense of being at war is always followed by some sort of battle. This movie had roughly about 5 minutes of actually ""battle"" scenes. All of which were air strikes, boring. In the end it's about the us wanting to watch gore, violence and seeing things get blown up. I wanted to see limbs fly, not a bunch of idiot, undisciplined soldiers party and act like animals.

The story lacks when the realism does not happen; I am sure bad events happen during war. Jarhead shows the causes, boredom, stress, and stupidity, which happens with the human factor, and different personalities. The movie also shows the positive and the Spartan of marine life. I find the irony or duality of the movie is the character who is the decent, most level headed guy; the glue of the squad is the soldier which will be dishonorably discharged from the corp. Even the level headed soldier unglued when ordered or cheated out of the chance for a enemy kill. Why?

"noralee","6","2","6","7 November 2005"," Boys Go to Late 20th Century R Rated War
","""Jarhead"" is a visually stunning celebration of making an R rated film about enlisted men, ground level troops from basic training through homecoming in a late 20th century war. And that's it.<br/><br/>The first third is a repeat of every movie ever made about basic training, including ""Full Metal Jacket"" and even having Jamie Foxx channel Louis Gossett Jr. from ""An Officer and A Gentleman."" Just that now we get to hear a lot of variations of the ""F"" word in conversations and scatological marching chants. The squadron is even set up as the diversity of the new Army (there's an amusing interchange about unfamiliarity with author Anthony Swofford's Anglo-Saxon surname), as the inevitable kid from Compton now replacing the World War II stereotype of the boy from Brooklyn, with two Latinos, one dark, one light, with one a Cuba Libre proponent. That's just about all we learn about each of these guys, though at least we can tell them apart more than the guys in ""Black Hawk Down."" Peter Sarsgaard is mesmerizing but his character stays a bit of a mystery throughout. <br/><br/>Are these any different than scenes from an Queda training camp would be? Just as generals fight the previous war (the lesson learned here was to have overwhelming force and popular support), these guys get hopped up on Viet Nam War movies, though the message of ""Apocalypse Now"" seems lost on them and there's only one plaint for their own music (there's actually surprisingly little hip hop on the soundtrack though Thomas Newman's soundtrack and other selections are very effective). ). This section is tedious and loses the audience too soon.<br/><br/>The second third is the build-up to Gulf War I as it slowly changed from Desert Shield into Desert Storm, and which we at home knew a lot more about through CNN than these troops out in the desert did (and there's no sign of other members of the coalition), as they only get propaganda briefings a la the truism that the first victim of war is the truth. <br/><br/>This scabrous section is basically Boys Gone Wild with Boredom, that veers close to HBO's ""Oz"" territory and you can practically smell the latrines and body odor. The R rating could have been pushed much further here, as the full extent of what isolated men are like together is covered clinically in the voice-over that is only useful in this section and is otherwise too annoying throughout. A beefed up Jake Gyllenhaal is explosive in representing the marines' disintegrating mental state. The military does seem to have learned some lessons from this readiness experience to keep troops in touch with home, as seen in the recently canceled FX series ""Over There."" The scenes of press interviews have lost a bit of punch since we've seen since embedded reporters. <br/><br/>It is effective at showing how a brutal misogyny can develop in these situations (with a toss-off about fertility as a half-hearted balance) such that the women in their lives become The Enemy in the bitter ""Wall of Shame"" of cheating wives and girlfriends. (There's a nasty vignette of a wife turning her husband's fondness for ""The Deer Hunter"" back on him.) It's a small stretch to understand how in other cultures and at other places rape and pillaging could become a weapon of war as a release. (Homophobia is not dealt with.) War looks like a controlled outlet for testosterone.<br/><br/>The third section is all about Roger Deakins' cinematography, from the blinding white out of the desert to the burning oil wells, to friendly fire and collateral damage. It is starkly beautiful.<br/><br/>There are some political points here as gradually the sniper marines realize they are irrelevant in an air war, but we know that won't be the case in the Gulf War Part 2 that's now urban guerrilla battles. ""Three Kings"" was much better at combining the grunts' and the wider cultural and political perspectives, though there's some token discussion about dissent. The film reinforces another truism that troops in battle fight for their buddies, not for ideology (presumably in Queda as well). <br/><br/>The concluding coda is heavy-handed, including the closing narrative point: ""All wars are different. All wars are the same."" ""Best Years of Our Lives"" made the same points and almost the same story lines.<br/><br/>While Chris Cooper and Dennis Haysbert seem to get a kick out of strutting around as superior officers, I doubt the military can use this as a recruiting film, as there's brief points about inadequate equipment and risky issued drugs."

","Jarhead (2005): Dir: Sam Mendes / Cast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Peter Sarsgaard, Chris Cooper, Jamie Foxx, Lucas Black: Energizing war film about those individuals that walk through trauma without choice or care. It stars Jake Gyllenhaal as a young marine who goes through basic training while observing the attitudes of those around him. One of its flaws is that its structure isn't always focused and the conclusion isn't as remarkable as it could have been yet director Sam Mendes delivers realism as if this is his observation of leaving home to face war and the reality of uncertainty. Mendes previously made a great film called American Beauty. He followed it up with an effective gangster thriller called Road to Perdition. Here he is with his third success and the genre is war films. Gyllenhaal delivers a great performance as someone who discovers the highs and lows of being a soldier and slowly numbing himself to it. To its disadvantage the supporting roles are basically the usual round up of misfits. Jamie Foxx does pass the test as the commander who is fair but stern. Others who appear are Peter Sarsgaard, Lucas Black and Chris Cooper, all fine actors but they get lost in the clichÃ©s that come with the territory. Although not the best of its kind, the film does deliver on its grueling theme. It regards the devastating affects of violence met with numbing determination. Score: 7 / 10"

","Sam Mendes' Jarhead is the true story of what former marine Anthony Swofford went through before, during, and after the Persian Gulf War. The movie stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Swofford a marine who fired his gun years before the gulf war happened but never got to fire a gun during a time of war. This is truly what I consider to be a great piece of movie making and with both Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx giving the best performances of their entire careers in one of 2005's best films. Director Sam Mendes took the time to create a war movie classic, which goes on a par with Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, The Devil's Brigade, The Deer Hunter, and Patton. This move also shows what the marines have to go through constantly. As Gene Shalit of U.S.A Today ""A Masterwork, Jarhead is more than a movie, It's an experience."". I truly agree with that because that is actually what Anthony Swofford went through during his time in the Marine Corps. For those people who are veterans in any military branch or are currently serving right now and if you get to watch this movie it will stay with you for a very long time."

","For me, Jarhead is one of the best war films ever made, and certainly the best on the Kuwait conflict. It was not until after the film I checked reviews for it, and was shocked to find it being overlooked and criticised because of it's ""lack of action"". This shows an utter misinterpretation of the film, one of the main themes of which is the unbelievable build up to what was a 4 day ground battle, in which Jake Gyllenhaal remarks that he ""never even fired my rifle"". The long, drawn out wait for that ""one kill"" is what drives the movie, and was something I found completely fascinating. I would highly recommend you watch it, or if you watched it and didn't enjoy it, re-watch it, thinking about it from this angle. It is an enthralling, realistic account of a soldier's life in war."

Saving Private Ryan was the best WWII movie, Dr. Strangelove or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb was the best Cold War movie, Apocalypse Now was the best Vietnam War movie and I think Jarhead may be the best Gulf War movie. <br/><br/>A good list of actors who I don't know but am aware of stared in this movie , but Jamie Foxx was the only actor who I've watched another film starring him. And I saw Evan Jones in 8 Mile. very passionate acting made the experience more realistic and made it a better film. <br/><br/>The cinematography was absolutely brilliant. The filming of the scorching dessert was amazing although it wasn't even filmed in the middle east. The way it's filmed makes me feel uncomfortable watching the soldiers in that flaming dessert, but that is just good production values. <br/><br/>It was based on the 2003 book by former marine Anthony Swafford, and what an experience that poor guy had but he was still cool enough with his book being made into a motion picture. <br/><br/>I like this film, although it's about a terrible war happening in the 80s, there was a nice vibe. You know all the comedy and comical moments which happened. This is one of my favourites and always will be and to be honest It deserves a better rating than 7.0/10. <br/><br/>Overall great movie based on the experiences of a ex-marine, good screenplay and great acting. I must say that this film is not for people who are weak hearted because there is a lot of strong war imagery which I know a lot of people are quite sensitive about.

From the trailer, it seemed like it would be a predictable gung-ho ad for the Marines. And it was shunned by any major awards. My, how everyone was wrong. This film was a victim of miscalculated ads and PR. Those looking for The Sands of Iwo Jima were disappointed, and those who would enjoy a character study with more questions than answers were scared away.<br/><br/>The actors in the film are outstanding.

","I don't know. I ordered a war movie but I got something else. I have never been to war but this movie made it appear dull and boring. I appreciate the ""getting into the heads"" of the characters. The acting was flawless. Like everyone else has said the cinematography was outstanding. Director, as always, does a great job.<br/><br/>Having said that, I found no arc to the story, and I am not sure the story was anything more than one soldier's perspective. It just seemed to be a random series of vignettes which relied heavily on homo erotic themes. Even the scene where the dude's wife screwed him over seemed to say 'women stink, stick with your man buddies'. That scene was shameless foreshadowing, by the way.<br/><br/>Jake's Christmas performance, which frankly was like watching a gay stripper, seemed out of character to me. But Jesus, can that boy shake his ass or what (but it pulled me out of the film). Furthermore there seemed to be a whole lot of Jake flesh and man flesh in general. Not that there's anything wrong with hot nekked men, but I thought I was going to see a movie about war."

","I would happily recommend this movie, but something i would say is, if your looking for a war movie with all out action like saving private Ryan or something you are looking at the wrong type of film, this is in fact a completely fresh look at things. The heartache and pain of going to war, risking your life, and you weren't even needed anyway. They go through the heartache of training, risking their lives, and don't get to play the part, they had always trained for, dreamt of, and wanted to. This film also provides a look at what keeps the soldiers motivated and what could happen if their motivation is taken from them, it leaves them lonely and out of their mind, when they need to try and defend their country. It also shows the bounds between soldiers, and some of the after affects, and provides you with new thoughts, opinions, and answers. And also you might learn new things about what goes on, that you didn't know.<br/><br/>With a fresh all out talented cast, that we all need to see more of, you can see a lot of fresh faces for a lot of future movie roles, with actors to take over for the new generation of movie making! This film took a whole new look at things with a 21st century edge of movie-making, direction, and filming with an excellent soundtrack."

","This is an important film to any fan of war films. The true story, told from the memories of Anthony Swofford ( very well portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal) is an eye opener, a window into the way life of in the military. To see the way ""Swoff"" changes from a kid fresh out of high school, eager for opportunity to an in compassionate, barely sane soldier of war is genuinely shocking. What makes it more unique is that it this isn't a movie of action and violence, it's about the mental toll a soldier takes during war. The film is well directed by Sam Mendes, who's direction, reminiscent of Paul Greengrass, brings the appropriate grittiness to the movie. Peter Sarsgaard's performance as ""Troy"" really stood out as well. The emotional struggle he goes through adds another dimension to the film and at times took my attention from the main character. Jamie Foxx's performance as Stf. Sgt. Stykes was also very good, as that authority figure who acts tough but who's vulnerability shows during rough moments. Any fan of war pictures really owe it to themselves to see this. It's a sobering portrait of the war inside a soldier's head as well as the conflict around them."
"minx-pietz","9","1","2","25 November 2006"," worth watching
","I have seen a few other films with Jake Gyllenhaal in, such as Donnie Darko, The Good Girl and Brokeback Mountain, and I was always impressed with his performances. When my brother mentioned Jarhead to me positively, I was keen to watch it, and when I did, I was not let down. What I like about this film is that it is quite different from other war films I have seen- not much actually happens, which is the point really, but my attention was not lost. Another brilliant performance from Jake Gyllenhaal, and just as good were Jamie Foxx, Scott MacDonald, Peter Sarsgaard and others, giving a very realistic image of ""jarheads"". It kept a slightly brutally sinister side to it, and I liked how it seemed that some deaths were more important than others. Although Jarhead had great acting and good camera directing, I don't think I would go as far as to call it a favourite of mine. It was narrated by the main character, Swaff, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, and I think perhaps the narrations were rationed to give it a more even, realistic effect, but I think it would have improved the film if there were more of it. I felt it could help the audience feel more involved and see things better from their point of view. It could also help them understand the point of the film more. I did feel a little like the audience was just sitting on the side, watching everyone else, when it should have been a part of it. I was also a little bit disappointed with the ending, I felt like I wasn't left with anything to think about, and if my last thoughts on the film were negative due to this ending, I feel I'm left feeling unhappy about this film, when it, all in all, was quite good. Apart from these bad points, I think it is worth watching, with good acting, pleasant subtlety, and, to be honest, Jake Gyllenhaal looks quite good topless."
"general-melchett","9","1","2","30 October 2006"," A very aggressive and truthful war film.
","Jarhead is far harder to watch than the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down - instead of being a gory war flick like these two, it instead revolves around the times when soldiers don't fight - they wait for battle, and get to know each other. This film never passed on the bad language - it used the f-word about 250 times. This film definitely put me off joining the army - though some of it is exaggerated, it sums it all up really - the types who are sent to the army are literally sent there - they never do it out of their own will. They are there because they are bad men. The film is rough, rude, and crude in parts (it didn't need to be crude, though the film is based a lot on the Marines missing and showing off their girlfriends), but it gives a stronger message then Black Hawk Down, and shows the immense struggles, physical and emotional pains, and extreme climates that recruits have to go through before their battles. Everybody must see this film - it is a film that shows the opposite side of war that Black Hawk Down shows - the times when recruits actually wish they were fighting. A must see. This film is only let down by the fact that there isn't a great deal of character in it, but other than that, it is riveting. A spiffing job! 9/10"
"MLDinTN","3","1","2","21 October 2006"," needed to be more entertaining
","I didn't think much of this film. The story was bland once they got to Iraq. The first part was OK, since it had some laughs with all the cussing and yelling done by the drill Sergent. Once they get to Iraq, they turn into frat boys. These elite snipers have fake orgies, have parties prancing around in almost nothing, shoot rifles in the air during a huge party-that seemed dangerous to me. Then they portray the soldiers as being angry because they never have a chance to shoot someone. One soldier goes psycho because he didn't get to fire a shot. The film also portrays some of the soldiers feeling that's it a waste of time to protect the oil fields.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: One of the worst war movies I've seen, and I like war movies. I don't recommend it."
"djfaulk05","9","1","2","20 September 2006"," I think you need to watch it again........................
","Many viewers and critics fail to see the potential for what this movie has. From the adaption of Anthony Swofford's memoir, Jarhead reveals itself as a story of self-becoming through the eyes of a 20-year old Marine CORPS scout sniper.<br/><br/>From the first watch, one can say that this story is mainly about nothing. This is not a war flick, yet the irony of it all is that, it is. What I mean by this statement of 'another war movie,' is in the aspect of it sharing the same emotions of any type of war; killing and the fear of being killed. Jarhead levels itself on a more emotional level rather than on a physical killing mode level. We peer through Swoff's emotion as we see him go through the most awkward phases of ignorance, sense of belonging, and insanity.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie because it has many elements revolved around the self and the idea of the CORPS functioning as a family. Although I may add that this movie is a little slow to start, it counteracts with its dark humor and silly antics of Marine CORPS boredom. I believe that this movie is a good account of what war is capable of doing with or without physical combat. This movie shows the human side of soldiers in their natural state, whether alert, depressed, happy, sexually frustrated, angry, or insane. All of this shows the intensification of each character and their personality throughout the movie. It shows that people who join the army are not killers, murderers, and people who just fight to serve their country. But that they are HUMAN, and go through human emotions.<br/><br/>Just as Swoff said, ""every war is different, every war is the same,"" we fight each war differently, mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Yet every thing that is expressed in war, mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually...is universal."

","The movie wasn't up to my expectations. It wasn't as thought provoking as a war movie should be. It's not an action packed movie so at the very least I was expecting a movie with some interesting psychological insights. There was about 2 thought provoking dialogs in the entire movie.<br/><br/>The marine was not judgemental so the story was more of an observation and never really had any sort of argument. The movie lacked a direction. I didn't learn anything new and after watching it, there was nothing to contemplate.<br/><br/>I was mainly disappointed because I was expecting American Beauty type of movie from Sam Mendes. A movie that makes you really think long after it's over.<br/><br/>To me there's either a lot of action or an interesting story that's worth watching. This movie was neither, it was simply a real life experience from a marine."
"Tehmeh","8","1","2","12 June 2006"," A war movie with no plot - and yet good
","At first, it seemed that this movie was trying to be Full Metal Jacket, Thin Red Line and Platoon all at once. I was wrong, it wasn't simply trying to be anything else but an adaptation of Anthony Swofford's book. And it was fine. Never read the book, so I can't do comparisons.<br/><br/>First of all, there is no plot, and probably even no agenda. It's simply a story. The scenes are powerful at best and generally well done, and they hold some space for the viewer to think about them, it's not just things happening with haste. As said above, It's not like the movie is trying to tell you something, it just tries make you feel and think. You can really put yourself into several characters' position at times - even though the characters never come close, and they feel a bit distant.<br/><br/>You may think that when a movie has no strong plot, it may be just a confusing bunch of scenes, which have nothing to do with each other. This isn't the case - you get a clear grip on what's happening all the time and ""Jarhead"" doesn't confuse its viewer.<br/><br/>Visually ""Jarhead"" is an impressive film. It looks somewhat like Black Hawk Down all the way - which is not a bad thing. There are some beautiful and stunning scenes. The burning oil wells making the sky black while the sun is trying to get through the thick smoke - beautiful and ugly at the same time. There are some dream-like scenes too and they serve their purpose.<br/><br/>This is not a movie where everything explodes and everyone dies, quite the opposite. If you expect constant shooting and intense battles, you may not like this film. But hey, we've seen enough of those, haven't we? The strong parts of this movie are also the weakest - there is no plot, or no message at all. It gives the viewer a chance to replace him-/herself with the character(s) and experience everything in a certain personal way, but on the other hand it's not that rewarding in the end. <br/><br/>Recommended. Not a war movie in a sense that we only get little or no battles at all, but...I'm just repeating myself here, aren't I? Try it yourself, you might appreciate it. I think this is one of those films for which you have to be in a certain mood to enjoy yourself."
"98nurdinm-1","8","1","2","24 May 2006"," ""Jarhead""
","""Jarhead"" tells the true story of Anthony Swofford, played here by Jake Gyllenhall. Swofford was trained as a Marine, and in particular as a sniper. He went with other troops to fight in the first Gulf War, but in the end spent most of the time in the desert dying of boredom. When they eventually saw action it was for only a few days, and the frustrated Swofford never even shot anybody with his sniper rifle.<br/><br/>This film is really very good in some places. There's a wonderful sense of black humour throughout, although at the beginning during the Boot Camp sequences it does get kind of ""Sgt. Bilko"" in silliness.<br/><br/>Things take a darker turn very suddenly when, during the training sequences later on,one of the soldiers-in-training panicked and ended up dead on barbed wire. This sets the pace for the rest of the film - moments of dark, twisted humour suddenly changed into shocking war images.<br/><br/>To be honest, it can be argued that this is nothing new - there are moments of dark humour in ""Saving Private Ryan"" for example, though you'd have to be incredibly morbid to find them laugh-out-loud funny - but Sam Mendes, the director, seems to set the tone well - we don't get too much humour, we don't get too much war imagery.<br/><br/>The problem is finding a way of showing the boredom of the soldiers without boring the audience, and I think that Mendes does this well. As Swofford, Gyllenhall shows another side to his increasingly impressive calibre of acting - he's done teen, heartthrob, genius, gay cowboy, and now soldier - is there any part this guy can't play well? Gyllenhall is impressively supported by a number of good actors, particularly Jamie Foxx and Peter Sarsgarrd. The music, by Thomas Newman, is once again a successful collaboration between Newman's notes and Mendes' images.<br/><br/>But there are a few problems. As with every war film, sentimentality enters in at some point, though thankfully not until near the end of the film. When it comes to the end of the film it also didn't seem to be a satisfactory ending to me. Sure, we saw what happened to the characters after returning from war, but can't we have a little bit more info? What does Troy (Sarsgarrd) die of for example? Finally, to me the most disappointing part of all in terms of music, we hear the sample from Kanye West's ""Jesus Walks"", but where is Kanye over the end credits? That would have been a fitting end to the film.<br/><br/>Despite these problems,I found ""Jarhead"" to be an entertaining portrayal of one man's experiences of the reality of war - it's not always ""Apocolypse Now"" after all. I think that others will be divided over this because there does not seem to be a clear stance on whether or not this film is anti-war or not. Personally, I don't think it matters. What matters is that this is a story about a man who goes to war - not a propaganda piece such as ""Farenheit 9/11"". It's up to the audience to judge whether or not this film is anti-war.<br/><br/>8/10"

Someone - PLEASE - put a bullet in the head of this one. I had four good friends serve in the military as pilots - three Navy and one USMC. One of the Navy boys served in the first Gulf War - a Navy Combat Search and Rescure (CSAR) pilot who flew missions to rescue downed airmen behind enemy lines. I know him and his courage - he was nothing like the soldiers portrayed in this movie. I wonder if the director and/or screenplay author even knew anyone who served in the military.

","It was the Gulf War, the time Iraq invaded Kuwait, and our troops went in and quickly set things right. It was the epitome of a non-war. I remember it well because my daughter was in the Air Force, stationed in England, working in a military hospital, and preparing for all the casualties they inevitably would have to deal with. There were no casualties.<br/><br/>Marine recruits are called jarheads. This movie tells a story about a marine recruit who turns out to be the best sniper of his division. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Anthony Swofford, ""Swoff"", who also wrote the basis for this story. So I presume it is fairly fact based. Swoff enters the Marines without knowing what he's in for, and the movie shows the difficulty of basic training, but after he gets his gun, and his spotter Troy (Peter Sarsgaard), he really is psyched to get some enemy kills.<br/><br/>Much of the middle of the movie deals with the deployment of American troops in the desert, for about a half year, fighting hard to not let boredom get the best of them. And dealing with the inevitable letter that their wife or girlfriend had left them. The movie is not about the war, it is about the men who almost fought, and how it affected their lives once they returned to civilian life.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. The climax is during the only mission, when Swoff and Troy are sent to take out two officers in a control tower. They get there, Swoff gets the enemy in his sights, when an officer shows up with the news that they will do an air strike instead, to quickly dispose of the men and the tower. But Troy pleads with him, just let them pick off one of them, it won't hurt anything. Just one kill would validate all their training and waiting in the hot desert. But to no avail, the air strike came, the men went home and never fired one shot at the enemy."

Not this one.<br/><br/>The acting is good all around. The cinematography is also very good and some scenes of the oil fires (remember them?) almost make you feel like the oil is raining down on you too. Those scenes are that good. But, this movie first deals with the time before the war actually starts for these Jarheads as they wait in the desert for the signal to go. Now, you can see how the time was spent and as mentioned already these things did happen and you can judge the results for yourself.

"stvstt","6","1","2","28 January 2006"," This movie fails to hit its target
","Since American Beauty, a Sam Mendes film is much awaited for and it's difficult to believe that this is only his third main feature outing. Mendes skilfully and faithfully renders Anthony Swoffords autobiography Jarhead to the big screen. The film follows Swoffords short career in the US Marines and his selection and specialist training as a Marine sniper in the first gulf war.<br/><br/>The film initially follows familiar ground of isolation, and gradual loss of personal identity and values: the loss of ethics  'thou shalt not kill' is discarded as liberalistic bulls**t; and the infidelity of wives and girlfriends augments the sclerosis from the world he left behind. The unfamiliarity and physical remoteness of the gulf, and the stripping down of each soldiers personality into one-shot 'killing machines', shepherds the company of men together. Branding each other with hot irons becomes a mark of fellowship. Swoffords nearest companions are his hard assed Drill Sergeant Sykes (Foxx), and his enigmatic and reflective spotter Alan Troy (Sarsgaard). These are practical relationship based on the purpose of the job. They are a team united by the killing power of their skills and equipment. Nothing more.<br/><br/>The specialist training ensures than Swoffords skills can only be used rarely. A sense of ennui deliberately pervades the movie, and for the ordinary soldier masturbation provides the only liberation from the months of boredom and madness of the war. When, in those few moments action does come they rush to it willingly, hoping to get that one shot in, hoping to fulfil in that one action the whole purpose of their training and their entirely raison d'etre. When Swofford finally gets his chance to shoot an Iraqi Officer, this becomes an anti-catharsis as in the second before the trigger is pulled he is ordered to stand down. He finishes his war without firing a single round. The film is one of successive personal losses (individuality, girlfriend, and purpose). The crushing loss is saved for the end when they return to the US as heroes'. They finally lose their dignity and self respect when a ragged Vietnam vet gate-crashes their tour bus to sing their praises. They see in him the forgotten and unsung hero, and themselves as the fraudulent undeserving.<br/><br/>Although, seen as a sterilised a media event, Swofford rightly reminds us that that the psychological damage to the ordinary soldier would pervade their lives, and in a sense they can never leave the Gulf. For that much he deserves our respect and sympathy. This is compounded by the suicide of Alan Troy's and his inability to return to the ordinary life he resented.<br/><br/>The film does have large measures of black humour: Playing (American) football in chemical suits for the benefit of the press, only to complete disrobe anarchically for the camera when they got fed up with the set piece; Gyllenahaal dancing naked in a tent party, wearing nothing but a strategically placed Santa hat for modesty; Gyllenhaal miming Revelie in the absence of a bugle. These are sane things to do in an insane situation. <br/><br/>Mendes and Swoffield have been unfairly asked to reference this movie to the current conflict in Iraq. Despite being different conflicts same terrain, the movie is quietly an unconventional anti-war movie and as such would not sit well with the American psyche if declared as such. The leitmotivs of isolation, futility, dehumanisation sit well with previous anti-genres like Paths of Glory, Catch 22, and of course Apocalypse Now. And this is the central problem of the movie. Though a heart rendering and genuine recollection of memories from Swofford, the film is almost pastiche of movies that we have seen before. We can easily compare Foxx's drill Sergeant Sykes with Lee Marvins 'Reisman' in the Dirty Dozen. We can compare Gyellenhaal's Swofford with Martin Sheens 'Willard' in Apocalype Now. We can genuinely compare the insanity, violence, and surreal nature of war in this movie with a trenche of others. The interest in this movie is simply the relation of its story to current events. An America public which is denied realistic news and information about its current military involvement looks to a film that emotes sentiment and lost dreams for direction.<br/><br/>A crisp script, stunning photography, and sterling performances by Gyllenhaal, Foxx, and Starsgaard , give this film the esteem it deserves, but I doubt that it will enjoy a long shelf life. Gyllenhaal deserves special comment as he clearly has shrugged off his teenager persona (its only three years since Day After Tomorrow), but with three of his movies released in the same month the variety and depth of roles he's undertaken can be undermined by each successive film release. Gyllenhaal's Swoffield, and Foxx's Sgt Sykes are entirely plausible but Sarsgaard's Alan Troy remains too enigmatic. Swofford 'got lost on the way to college'; Sykes could have had a £100K a year job, but 'likes war too much' (reminiscent of Robert Duvall's Killgore); but we have no explanation as to why anti-hero Troy is here or what makes him tick, apart from the throw away remark that in war he could 'be someone'. <br/><br/>Whereas Michael Moore polemisized America's current Gulf engagement, Mendes de-politicises the earlier engagement, and this flaws the film. Audiences deserved a braver movie, and sadly they didn't get it with this one. They deserved better"

","I just loved this film, it really wasn't what I had expected and in no way should be described as a war film, in the traditional sense! If anything, this film is a true war film, and is leagues above rubbish like Saving Private Ryan and films that trivialise war and suffering.<br/><br/>Set in the first Gulf war, Swoff joins the marines instead of going to college and ends up being sent to Iraq. His experience of war is very different to what one might expect, but shot in a way which still keeps the viewer in anticipation about what comes next.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal shines in the lead role, and Peter Sarsgaard also puts in an amazing performance. The cinematography is lush, with beautiful wide screen shots of the oil fields of Iraq and others which I won't go into as it will spoil seeing them! The music for this film is great, chosen very well so that its really funny when it kicks in! All in all, you must see this film, its very clever and not arrogant at all, with some really touching moments which will remind you of that first time you watched Apocalypse Now! A must see for all!"
"Antagonisten","7","1","2","17 January 2006"," Different
","War movies are a difficult genre. The trick is to avoid both being overly patriotic and heroic, as well as avoiding being too negative. It seems to me that most war movies are made with either one of those two agendas, pro-war or anti-war. Both movies bore me really, it can work when the style is more oriented towards satire though.<br/><br/>""Jarhead"" is different in the way that it stays clear of both agendas mentioned above. Based on the autobiography of a marine who served in the Gulf war, it tries to show the life of the individual marine. Staying away from politics is usually a good idea, especially when dealing with something fairly recent like the Gulf war. In scenes reminiscent of ""Full Metal Jacket"" we get to follow soldiers when they go through training and then we get to see them preparing for the war in the desert. A war that never seems to reach them.<br/><br/>If you expect an action-filled war movie in the vein of say ""Black Hawk Down"" you will be sorely disappointed. This is a much more bleak and, i believe, more realistic look at how the modern foot soldier experiences war. He's been replaced in many ways by machines like tanks and, above all, airplanes. And in the end boredom is his worst enemy.<br/><br/>Even though boredom is a prevalent theme throughout ""Jarhead"", the movie is never boring in my opinion. Rather it's an interesting look at pretty regular people that find themselves in an extraordinary situation, a situation that puts all their expectations to shame. Aside from the story ""Jarhead"" is also a very solid movie technically. The photography is beautiful, the music is well chosen and the direction from Sam Mendes is flawless. The acting is also above average from most of the actors, even Jake Gyllenhaal is pretty good. The one that stood out most though in my opinion was Jamie Foxx.<br/><br/>""Jarhead"" is a very untraditional war movie and that makes it worth watching all by itself. But it's also interesting, well made and contains some great acting. A war movie that probably appeals more to people who usually don't enjoy war movies."
"silent-kit","8","1","2","16 January 2006"," Not what i expected...
","I saw a trailer for this film a few weeks ago and was really unimpressed by it. Once I realised it was directed by Mendes, and that Deakins was the cinematographer I decided it'd be worth a watch As I took my seat i was half expecting a typical, unrealistic, pro-American 'war' film that would just try to justify America's current political position (albeit with some decent cinematography). Needless to say, what i actually got was something different. The film focuses on what it is to be a modern soldier, rather than the actual details of the Gulf War. Any major plot points are centred around the Marines and the way they interact with each other, and/or react to the situation they are in. The pace of the film is almost spot-on, and the performances of all the lead actors help give depth to the characters without it seeming forced.<br/><br/>I thought this film was brilliantly paced, and the cloying, claustrophobic tension was built to a climax excellently. Stand out performances came from Gyllenhaal and Foxx (an actor i'm usually unimpressed by), top this with some excellent cinematography, to give a film well worth watching.<br/><br/>Worth a watch, a different kind of war film..."
"sradu","10","1","2","16 January 2006"," In the desert
","This movie is about fear. About men and war, and about how far can you go, how far you push the limit when you are in a prison without walls: the desert. The thing that fascinated me about it is how flawlessly is built, the tension, the moments, the surrealistic scenes, everything. This is a movie that has a structure, finally i can say that there's a movie with some backbone. Where other movies try to achieve the thrills, this movie lets you thrilled. Where other movies try to come as art movies, this movie makes cinematographic art in a very concise and brilliant way (yes, Swoff's girlfriend&sand dream, the horse sequence, etc.). It has rhythm, tone, it has the tempo, and above all, dares to have its way. It dares to experiment and to refuse clichés, and to be witty and bold. I do not know if this movie will have its place in cinema history, but is definitely one of my favorites, for now, after the first screening."

","This film was awesome, i thoroughly enjoyed this take on the gulf war. I think all of the actors played their roles superbly and award winning Jamie Foxx played his convincing strict commanding officer perfectly. It was refreshing to see a war film not actually based on the battle, but on the mental struggle these marine officers had to go through day and night and not actually being able to see any of the action or use any of the skills they have learnt from their intense training. On the comic side of the film it offers the audience some cleverly put together one liners which will have you in stitches! A beautifully scripted masterpiece well done to the team of creators who took part in this! I recommend this film to anyone who likes a mix of genres all rolled into one film, this is an action, comedy and drama all rolled into one, go out and watch it!"

I already like Jake Gyllenhaal from his earlier movies (for ex Donnie Darko), so I hoped that he would make this movie better. Then the movie began, and It was funny!! It really surprised me. It was a funny and really good entertaining movie! I haven't read the book, so I cant compare it with the book. But The movie was great. It had humor and sarcasm. It showed the bad sides of war and the military. But it also showed some good sides, like how they all became friends, and the thing they did together. My other friends thought it was worthless and a ripoff to the movie ""Three kings"". But i haven't seen that one, so I cant say. But I liked it and i really recommend it!! SEE IT!!! :)"
"rosaishere","6","1","2","14 January 2006"," A superb war film... with no action
","The trailer had really hyped this film up for me and I thought it looked like one of the coolest films to come out in a while... I can safely say I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>The story follows that of Jake Gyllenhaal, a young American man who has no prospects for him back in America. Enlisting in the marines, he figures this may be a mistake. The story then unfolds with Gyllenhaal and his unit of marine led by Jamie Foxx on their tedious waiting in the desert for the Iraqis to finally strike to they can see some action.<br/><br/>The Iraqis never strike, but one by one the men begin to lose sight of what they are there for, and all of them are in someway affected by their times in the desert.<br/><br/>As stated in the title, no actual battle scenes occur in the film which I found bizarre for a war film... but I think it just deepens the meaning of this film, the way Swofford truly intended his story to be told.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx I feel turned in the best performance as the squad's staff sergeant delivering a very powerful yet funny role. Actually that said, this film is hilarious in places. For about the first hour you are treated to some scenes which aren't too far off from being in a Gulf War comedy.<br/><br/>The shooting style is brilliant with the scene in the burning oil fields being incredibly moody and darkly shot.<br/><br/>Overall I conclude this is the third masterpiece from Sam Mendes, and definitely worth a viewing.<br/><br/>10/10"
"albert-wayne","6","1","2","14 January 2006"," Some Good, Some Bad, Definitely Deserves to be seen nonetheless
","I had high hopes when I entered Jarhead, despite his short career, Sam Mendes has proved to be a reliable and effective director, a future master in the works, both American Beauty and Road to Perdition have a proud space in my home video collection.<br/><br/>After Jarhead, I still think he is a great director, but Jarhead sadly does not match up to the perfection he achieved in his previous works. However, not perfect is not the same as terrible, and Jarhead is far from being terrible, and I think it's mainly to Mendes direction, hence, his work should be commended.<br/><br/>The main flaw in Jarhead is the structure of the screenplay, particularly in the opening minutes, which in this particular film, were critical and sadly diminish the movie a great deal. For those who have seen it, you will know what I mean, the obvious replication of Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. Watching Full Metal Jacket could be considered a spoiler move regarding Jarhead. It has been mentioned before, that Jarhead is the Full Metal Jacket of our generation. In some cases that affirmation is a poignant reflection, but for a particular case, it's a sad reality. A critical scene becomes almost a spoof of Full Metal Jacket, making the movie fail to establish itself strong from the beginning.<br/><br/>Most war movies that can be compared to Jarhead(I'm talking about The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket) established themselves from the start as being unique, special, emotionally shocking, and a commitment to be movies made out for a reason, Deer Hunter was mythic and metaphoric interpretations about the nature of war, and the tragedy of Vietnam, Platoon as a more personal and realistic approach to the struggles of individual soldiers, and Full Metal Jacket to the tragedy of the concept of soldier, all important films with impeccable craft.<br/><br/>As for Jarhead, although the craft is very much as intense as in all of the previous mentions, with memorable scenes and sequences, the film's narrative seems to go, or try to go everywhere, and nowhere. For instances the film tries to emulate the personal drama of the individual soldier pretty much like Platoon and Full Metal Jacket did, then it changes to metaphoric and mythic films like Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now, then changes to a sort of more politically oriented film, and finally, plays with all those 3, and the it's concluded with extreme haste.<br/><br/>The film tries to cover too much ground, using mixed methods of narrative and approach to the subject matter, giving the feeling that the screenplay did not have a clear intention of what it wanted to achieve.<br/><br/>Personally, the film would have been enormously benefited by a narrative more a lá Deer Hunter meets Platoon, omitting the mythic aspects of the film(Russian Rullete). A lesser Full Metal Jacket approach to the First Act would have immensely helped the film by establishing a more serious focus, and a more realistic focus, kinda what Cimino did with Deer Hunter, and the whole First Act with the Wedding and such. And extended on the finale, just like Cimino did for Deer Hunter and Oliver Stone did for the post Vietnam Ron Kovic in Born on the Fourth of July.<br/><br/>The obvious ode paid to Full Metal Jacket which backfires at the first act is a huge detriment to the film's result, the writer could have invented a better way to show how the film paid homage to Kubrick, one that would seem less copy/paste if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>Aside from that, the film works, with it's impressive cinematography that makes all of the Irak sequence a memorable cinematic experience, on a par with Apocalypse Now, and even Lawrence of Arabia for that matter. The acting was also worthy of recognition, Jamie Foxx proofs you can have a good post Oscar movie, Peter Sarsgaard was brilliant as usual, and Jake Gyllenhall managed to make the jump DiCaprio had when he fell under the command of Master Scorsese.<br/><br/>Mendes did a great job with the main body of the movie, one that deserves huge merit. My only advice to him is that he should have had at least two more re-writes in order to make the story(Beginning and End) a little better, more engaging I think qualifies as a good term, both the opening and the conclusion of the film feel a little too sophomore film making, very unusual to to what the rest of the film offers.<br/><br/>Aside from that, a very good addition to the war drama genre, despite my complaint, I do recommend it."
"BenCaird","9","1","2","13 January 2006"," Beautifully shot film with an edge of sympathy that isn't usually evident in this genre.
","In this film we follow the lives of a marine corps of snipers through their training to their action (or what turns out to be very little action) in the 'Desert Storm' war in Iraq in the early 1990s. I had read a few reviews of this film before seeing it and I have to say that I disagree with any calling it 'flat', 'slow' or 'boring'. If you are a film watcher that cannot concentrate for very long and just want to see a film with impressive skirmish scenes, this is not the film for you. However, Sam Mendes has created a film with some very impressive cinematography that paradoxes beautifully against the tedium the soldiers feel in their wait for their crack at some action. <br/><br/>The other reviewer for this film talks of how refreshed he felt seeing a film in this genre that captures the essence of war without engaging in the politics behind it. I however do not agree with this statement. The whole film is brimming with political and humanitarian satire. The breakdown of many of the soldier's relationships with wives and girlfriends during their extended stay away ""serving their country"" is dealt with with remarkable tenderness as it battles the sky high testosterone levels and egos as would be imagined in such a military environment.<br/><br/>What I believe to be the finest scene of the film pictures the soldiers being rained on from the black skies of tar due to the oil wells being a blaze in every direction, digging their 'sleeping holes', as a helicopter flies over their heads playing The Doors' 'Break on Through to the Other Side' over a loudspeaker. Jake Gyllenhaal's character looks over to his friends, dejected after months of inactivity, and remarks ""This music isn't even for our war"". Having come from a family with a Vietnam vet for a father, a theme that reappears with this main character throughout the film is that the war isn't one he should be involved in as an young American man.<br/><br/>The question that this film raises, in common with other films of its genre, is... ""Is it all worth it?"". With the final scene showing us Jake Gyllenhaal's character coming home to his life as a normal citizen, to a girlfriend that he learns has left him and found another guy, we're really left with the feeling that no, it wasn't worth it at all. <br/><br/>A great film with a deeply satirical view on a soldiers life, ambition, and ultimately their use weighed up against how much they sacrifice in order to 'serve their country'."

It's actually a profound drama disguising itself as a war movie. <br/><br/>Gyllenhaal, Sarsgaard, Foxx ... everybody in this film deserved to be cast in it. The visuals are both simple and stunning *(no way am I ever gonna forget the oil horse!)* Thomas Newman is one of the finest artists in the soundtrack business and somebody should give him an Oscar already!<br/><br/>I'd recommend this to anybody with an open mind to offbeat/mainstream cinema!

"Leadfoot_vts","7","1","2","11 January 2006"," A hard job done well
","Firstly, I must note, it is hard to make a good war movie. It may easily turn into some shiny, propagandistic piece (like Pearl Harbor or We Were Soldiers) or it might end up being too stereotype-filled with the hall of war. Or possibly a combination of both... I think, the creators of the film did their best to make Jarhead an exception. They do not show us bullet-torn human bodies to achieve a cathartic effect and do not create heroic characters who act in name of such trite values as honor or courage (after all, nobody believes that such figures did exist in wars). Instead, they try to be as realistic as possible, but still entertaining. In addition they deliberately distance themselves from politics. They are not interested in the reasons, the causes or the outcomes of war, just in the plain, first-hand effect of it on the soldier.<br/><br/>I think, this goal was achieved rather successfully, although at some points I found the film a bit opposed to the current war in Iraq, and at other points (culminating in the scene with the horse and the scene with the burned corpses in the destroyed vehicle column) a bit of that ""oh, how cruel war is, and how much pain it causes for the innocent"" message."
"robert_rock","8","1","2","9 January 2006"," All around entertaining
","Wasn't sure what to expect with the jarhead movie. With the fracture in American opinion over the current conflict in Iraq, a film centered around the original conflict could have fallen on one side of the fence or the other. That being said, I think this film did a decent job skirting the middle ground and focused on being a ""jarhead"" much more than the politics of the situation. In the film, there are characters that are predictably on each side of the political spectrum, but they aren't distracting to the point. I think this film is really showed the unglamorous aspect of the grunts in war. No Rambo like action here, just the almost never ending wait with no pay off. Jake is excellent in the film as usual and Jamie Foxx is believable in his role. All and all very entertaining and enjoyable movie."
"Buddy-51","8","1","2","29 November 2005"," very impressive, thoughtful war drama
","""Jarhead"" is a war movie not really about war. Rather, it's about that strange time before war, when young men and boys are trained to kill without hesitation or remorse, when group-think and group cohesion become the goal of every soldier, and when the boredom and tedium of waiting for the enemy to strike can be almost as unnerving and unbearable as the horrors of war itself.<br/><br/>The film is based on the true story of Anthony Swofford (superbly embodied by Jake Gyllenhaal), a Marine sniper who served in the Gulf War in 1991. The story begins in 1989, as Anthony is undergoing the grueling rigors of boot camp training. When Saddam Hussein invades Kuwait, Anthony is shipped off to the Middle East as part of the operation known as Desert Shield, soon to become Desert Storm. For Anthony and his fellow Marine sharpshooters, it is the waiting that turns out to be the least endurable aspect of the assignment, as they battle the discomforts of life in the Arabian Desert - and often each other.<br/><br/>At no time does ""Jarhead"" pretend to be anything other than the story of one particular soldier in one particular war; we never get the sense that Anthony is supposed to be representative of all Marines at any given time. As such, the movie eschews politics and philosophy, avoids heavy-handed moralizing and preaching, and refuses to either glorify or denigrate the men who are its subjects. Instead, it keeps it all life-sized and realistic, showing us how ordinary men cope with the extraordinary life of being a Marine in times of peace as well as times of war. Writer William Broyles Jr. makes every moment count as each of the major characters confronts some sort of personal demon, although Broyles never overstates the issues or indulges in cheap theatrics or hyperbole. The men remain complex and real, with each character drawing both strength and weakness from those around him.<br/><br/>Director Sam Mendes keeps the scale intimate and the story tightly focused on the interplay between the men, reserving most of the actual fighting scenes for the final act. The film is filled with memorable moments and unforgettable images that often border on the surrealistic: the boys achieving a near-orgasmic frenzy watching the helicopter scene in ""Apocalypse Now;"" their stumbling upon endless rows of burned-out vehicles filled with charred corpses of fleeing civilians; oil from set-afire wells raining down from ink-black clouds, turning day into night and covering the earth with a thick coating of sludge and ooze; an oil-drenched horse mysteriously emerging out of nowhere only to disappear back into the vast wasteland of the ruined, darkened landscape. The film is worth seeing for its imagery alone.<br/><br/>Those seeking a traditional war film - one heavily laden with booming artillery and graphic battle scenes - may find ""Jarhead"" a bit of a slow go at times, but those in the mood for a film about personal relationships set in a military context will find much to celebrate in this movie."
"dj_bassett","Null","1","2","16 November 2005"," Pointless
","There's no story here -- in fact, one of the 'points' of the movie is that nothing happens. As a slice of life it's been proved inaccurate by various people who've actually served -- and even if it was accurate I'd question the point of it, since GUNNER'S PALACE works much better at filling that niche (among other things, it has the merit of being actually true, ie a documentary.) Historically, it's ""theme"", that the infantry has been rendered pointless in an era of push-button war ala the Gulf War, couldn't be more out of date, as a brief glimpse at today's headlines will show. It's philosophical ""point"", that man receives meaning by what he does, is pseudo-profound at best, basically just dime store dorm room philosophizing. Dramatically so much of the movie seems ripped off from better films (FULL METAL JACKET and THREE KINGS, especially) that one is left feeling like one should've rented those instead.<br/><br/>Nicely acted, especially by Foxx. And really lovely cinematography at times, especially in the oilfire sequences. But pointless all around, should never have been a movie in the first place."
"pageiv","8","1","2","18 November 2005"," Hollywood cheers another military loser
","When I was in the Marine Corps, I had a roommate named Watters. Everyone called him ""Muddy,"" not so much for any musical talents he possessed, but because that summed him up completely. He would set his alarm for 5 a.m., then hit snooze six times because as he told me, ""Five is too early to get up."" He would think nothing of driving 40 miles away on a Wednesday night for nickel beer at some out of the way dive. He ""acquired"" items from fellow Marines, and treated my personal property as nicely has he treated his, which is to say not very well.<br/><br/>For barracks inspection, he would throw his laundry in a rucksack and keep it in the back of his pickup. On one glorious day he came in the room, visibly upset, someone stole his rucksack from the back of his truck. Though I wondered why someone would want his dirty undies, I smiled knowing he was out a $100 ruck.<br/><br/>The image of Watters is what I immediately thought of when I read Andrew Swofford's 2003 book, ""Jarhead."" Swofford stole from his fellow Marines, shirked duty, took credit for other's work, and thought he was he a typical Marine. In other words, Swofford and Watters would have gotten along just fine.<br/><br/>Many Marines have a love/hate relationship with the Corps; this was defiantly true for me. I felt that at times the Corps was the only family I would ever want or need. Then other times I wanted a personal protection order and divorce.<br/><br/>Swofford's relationship was decidedly hate/hate. His book was a clearinghouse for ""sea stories"" and urban legends that Marines tell each other while drinking. They would start ""I swear, this one time"" then everyone would roll his eyes because he heard the same story many times before. Swofford's stories inevitably ended with him, or some other Marine, looking like a psychopathic deviant. No Marine officer worth his or her pay would tolerate Swofford's insubordination and misconduct. He is the type of Marine, soldier, airman, and or seaman that leadership would move at once to remove before he could ""infect"" others.<br/><br/>Because of Swofford's view of the Marines, it makes perfect sense Hollywood was scrambling to put his story on the silver screen before the book's publication.<br/><br/>However, in a movie industry controlled by people that proclaim they ""support the troops,"" the book green-lit and fast-tracked is the one that disparages those that serve. Swofford claims ""Jarhead"" is only his story. Other than the parts he made up, he is right. More than that, it is a story of someone that belonged either in the brig or on the mental ward.<br/><br/>The movie itself is a vast improvement over the original material. The time constraints of the movie forced the producers to scrap most of Swofford's life in the Corps. What results is a seldom seen story of the Persian Gulf War. The biggest enemy faced down by the Marines in Jarhead is boredom.<br/><br/>Director Sam Mendes' previous films, the liberal orgy American Beauty and the stylistic Road to Perdition, had the look of an accomplished director. Jarhead at times takes the viewer closer than any CNN embed ever could, and a few times the dichotomy of keeping with the mission and the drudgery of an infantryman's life are as authentic as any image put on the screen.<br/><br/>If you are hoping an action filled war movie, Jarhead is the opposite. A few rounds of incoming fire and a friendly-fire strafing run by an A-10 are about all you are going to get. To be true to the individual in a war is to show the lack of actual combat. To be true to the honor of those that serve is to see this movie for what it is: seconds of fright surrounded by days (or in this case, months) of waiting. If Jarhead has one downfall it is filming boredom in an entertaining way.<br/><br/>The bureaucracy and the selfishness in the way we fight war are no clearer illustrated than when Swofford, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, finally has an Iraqi in his sights but is told to hold his fire because a major believes he may give away the surprise of pending air strike. After years of training, months of waiting, finally, he has a chance to do his job, but the major that denies him pulls up a lawn chair to watch the fireworks.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx (SSGT Sykes) leads the film along with a purpose just as his character leads his unit towards its ultimate goal, which is a plane ride home. The make up of the rest of the cast is complete in the color-in-the-blanks way many war movies go about casting. You have the redneck, the mentally challenged guy, the philosopher, and the barracks lawyer.<br/><br/>In the end, the real Tony Swofford was able to parlay his experiences into a book and movie earning him more money than many make over a lifetime. Maybe things work out for people like Swofford in that way. About two weeks after my roommate Watters lost his ruck, he was smoking outside our unit's hangar when a saw a PFC walk by with his ruck over his shoulder. I was disappointed at his serendipity. However, you do not have to call yourself Earl to understand Karma. A few months later when we deployed to Turkey, Watters got drunk and slashed the bike tires of the Air Force personnel in the tent next to him. The command promptly demoted him and barred him from reenlisting.<br/><br/>As thousands of Marines fight and die in the Global War on Terror I know someone in Hollywood could read about Watters and say, ""I can see a movie in that story."" Meanwhile, the true heroes do their jobs, largely unseen, and largely unappreciated.<br/><br/>http://www.geocities.com/pageiv71/jarhead.html"

The movie did have some very funny parts to it and the absurdity of war was certainly shown in the forefront.<br/><br/>However, this was really just a poor attempt to make a great film by taking bits and pieces from other films already made. I mean they even put in actual footage from Apocalypse Now! And the beginning of the movie might just as well have been the Dollar Store's version of Full Metal Jacket with the drill instructor pathetically trying to be R. Lee Ermey. The notion of the absurdity of war was ""borrowed"" right from Three Kings (but used in a different way). And the list went on and on.<br/><br/>Is the movie worth watching? Yeah, sure... but you might as well wait for it to come out on DVD. However, if you are in the armed forces (thank you for your service to our country), you might want to see it in the theatre as you would probably relate to the movie much better than us civilians.<br/><br/>It did give a different perspective regarding the life of a Marine which was interesting, but all in all it just wasn't anything special. However, I will say that Jamie Foxx did a nice job of acting in the movie.<br/><br/>I'd say go watch this film and then go watch Full Metal Jacket and you'll realize the sheer genius of Stanley Kubrick.

","I rated this a 7. But you must understand that I would never give a 10, so 7 is a very good rating.<br/><br/>I went to see this movie with great apprehension. Another shoot em up war movie, I thought. But it was the only one showing at the theater we like that showed an ounce of promise. That ounce quickly flashed into pounds as I sat there fixated on the beautiful editing, the remarkable acting, and the unexplained imagery.<br/><br/>Much like the movie Three Kings, the desert scenes were shot with an endless ability to make sand and nothingness glaring art. Scenes of rolling white sands, gushing pools of black oil, and the distorted waves of heat all lifted the viewers from their cushioned theater seats to the middle of the arid desert.<br/><br/>The acting by all the major characters was more than compelling, and aside from Peter Sarsgaard whom I was already a fan, also surprising. The shear anger portrayed by Gyllenhaal and the lonely loyalty portrayed by Sarsgaard were heartbreaking and so real. I truly believe that Sarsgaard and Jake Gyllenhaal both deserve Oscar nominations for these performances.<br/><br/>But the one aspect of this film that I find most intriguing and powerful was the absence of useless explanation. This movie went out of its way not to insult the intelligence of its audience. There was much left to our own discovery and introspection. That is what I appreciated most.<br/><br/>Regardless of one's feelings about war in general or the Gulf Wars in particular, there were impacts made by this film that cannot be denied. The horrifying emotions of soldiers from yesterday and today will likely never be completely understood. But films like Jarhead provide the much needed shed of light on their emotional plights during war and for the rest of their lives. Being able to illuminate these dark realities with comedy and humanity is why I believe Jarhead is one of the best films I have seen in a long, long time."

The movie seems like its going to have a lot of action but it deals with a much deeper meaning...GREAT MOVIE would go and see it again...The cast lineup was amazing everyone fit there part even the extras and background characters were awesome. The movie is also very funny, everyone in the audience is laughing, the movie puts u through so many emotions its a complete system overload...You do not know what to do when the movie is over you are just sitting there amazed. And when you finally walk out after that last credit roles up saying where they filmed the movie, (Imperial Valley and parts of Mexico, for all of you who do not want to stay until the end to see that. You will be saying to yourself that was an amazing movie and how much you felt emotionally involved with the characters and every thing they did you felt it with them.

","I really had to force myself to watch this whole movie. I too was in the military for the ""war on terrorism"" so please don't think I'm talking from a civilian point of view. As I watched this film, I thought to myself that Top Gun has competition. Either you saw a man naked, shirtless, or drunk. Oh and don't forget the Santa hat thing. The whole movie had a homosexual theme to it with a light splattering of drama a'la Real World. I personally didn't feel like sitting through another episode of that show. But I do feel the acting is better in it. The acting in Jarhead was about on the same level as me when I get a bad Christmas present. But I guess this is what passes for a good movie now and it makes me sick. What ever happened to the blockbusters? Ones that made you go to the theaters? Not ones nowadays that you say, ""well I'm gonna go see that I guess."" I wouldn't waste my time with this movie, and go rent Full Metal Jacket."
"nemssss26","10","1","2","12 November 2005"," Sam Mendes is Spielberg's Protégé - Jarhead is an instant classic
","Does anybody ever remember hearing about when the script for American Beauty came to Universal Pictures and Mr. Steven Spielberg got his hands on it? Well, he could have taken that movie, cast anybody he wanted, and probably of gathered at least as many nominations as the movie actually received. But he didn't. He decided to give it to somebody else. And who did he give it to you ask? A 35 year old English playwright director that was already famous for his work on Broadway. That person was Sam Mendes. Sam had already won Tony's, along with a number of other awards for his revival of several plays that have since then turned into classics. Some big stars that have already been in his plays were Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick, along with a number of others that I can't think of off the top of my head. He also worked with Rob Marshall (The director of Chicago, and the soon to be great Memoirs of a Geisha). Anyways, Spielberg saw something in Mendes's plays and decided to do something very original by giving the American Beauty scripted to him. We all know what happened with that little flick. Now, six years later, Mendes is at it again with ""Jarhead."" Mendes had already filmed Road to Perdition between these times. Perdition was equally good, but not as prolific as American Beauty, although, for a director to have his first two films like those was already a hell of a resume'. Spielberg had given Mendes a top of the line crew with famous cinematographer Conrad L. Hall (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, American Beauty, Road to Perdition). Conrad was by far, the most famous of his profession, but unfortunately, he died right after the filming of Road to Perdition, which earned him the Oscar two films in a row. This time around in Jarhead, Mendes (All grown up now and a professional on his own) recruited Roger Deakins for the cinematography of Jarhead. People really don't realize how big of a part the cinematographers or the screenwriters, or the editors, or the sound composers have to do with making a great film. Not just the director. Anyways, Mr. Roger Deakins is famous for this beautiful work in The Shawshank Redemption, The Hurricane, O' Brother Where Art Thou?, House of Sand and Fog, and now Jarhead.<br/><br/>With Mendes cast and crew together, the pieces were set for a classic. After viewing Jarhead twice, once for joy, and the second for critique I am convinced that Mendes is a master. Spielberg really knew what he was doing when he gave this young man the script to American Beauty. I really can't find any visual mistakes with Jarhead. I've also read some of the things people have wrote about this movie or in reviews. It seems our generation has grown to expect the usual blow em' up Hollywood crap that is usually seen every month. I mean, could you imagine living in the seventies, the time of sex, drugs, and rock n roll. This is when you had Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Chinatown, The Godfather and a slew of other classic, depressing, drug induced, and bizarre classics. Human beings have grown out of this because we never see it. If something, these days, is bizarre and artistic at the same, people generally get turned off. And that's a shame. That's the roots of film. And Mendes has dug into the roots of his makers to produce a classic of what film used to be. One of the moments of this film that really sticks in my mind is the scene with the horse emerging out of the darkness, with the firelight on its back covered in oil. Jake Gyllenhaal's character comes upon this and the scene is horrifically beautiful. This film has some of the most amazing glorious images I have ever seen on film. The desert seems to be on fire and it resembles true hell. Kudos to Roger Deakins and Sam Mendes for a very original look.<br/><br/>Now, I could go on and talk about the entire film, but my fingers are starting to hurt from carpel tunnel syndrome so I'm just going to highlight some of the other great aspects. The acting is far superb. You could tell that all of these actors were so excited to be a part of this. I usually don't like actors that were born into the business when they were young as Gyllenhaal was back in City Slickers as Billy Crystal's son, but Jakey boy does a hell of a job, along with the perfect Jamie Foxx, and Peter Sarsgaard especially. I think you will start to see a lot more of him. The soundtrack is also unbelievable. ""That's Vietnam music. Can't we get are own f****** music."" The sequence with the Nirvana song is great, along with everything else. Thomas Newman did a hell of a job sound and music.<br/><br/>The brotherhood in this is also great. I must say, this isn't much of a female film unless you appreciate the artistic aspect.<br/><br/>I am not going to continue. I'm just saying, please see this film, and then tell your friends, and your friend's friends. In fact, take them with you. It's better with a group. Tell your family too. This film also makes you want to enlist in the Marines. Surprisingly since most people said this was an Anti-War movie. ""F**k politics"" as Peter Sarsgaard says in the film.<br/><br/>We will see much more, hopefully, from Mr. Sam Mendes. Keep a look out for his film called ""Sweeney Todd"" in the next couple years. Congrats to Mendes and the whole cast and crew of ""Jarhead"" for all their hard work and for taking us back in the day of classic bizarre film.<br/><br/>Also keep an eye out for Spielberg's ""Munich"" coming out in December. Check out the preview here: http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=8395"

It definitely exceeded all my expectations, and I can't wait for the DVD! <br/><br/>As I watched, I saw, not a war movie, but a character study of these men...boys actually...thrown into a war they didn't know much about. It was an honest movie, I think, and it was BEAUTIFULLY filmed. I was sucked in and taken on a ride that wasn't about ""action"" or ""suspense""...it was about these few moments between the waiting, between the boredom. The crux of the movie (I won't say what because I don't want to spoil anything) moved me so much, because my heart ached for them. (That's the scene that convinced me that Peter Sarsgaard is the next big thing...next to Jake Gyllenhaal, of course!) <br/><br/>There's no hidden agenda in the film...there's no political stance. People are saying there's no plot. I beg to differ. I see a movie about the despair that they all felt when their war ended before it ever started. There WAS no plot in their lives in those few months. Their time in the desert was like a wheel that was spinning and not going anywhere. I felt the movie captured that to a tee.<br/><br/>Two thumbs up from me! :) Jenn"

","Hello IMDb addicts. This is Brady. And I am an amateur critic. I grade music as well as movies, and I just got back from a movie. It's called ""Jarhead"", and it stars Jake Gyllenhall, Jamie Foxx, and Peter Sarsgard. And I thought it to be the first cinematic response to the current war. Just maybe not directly. The movie starts as Anthony Swofford (Gyllenhall, hopefully an Oscar nomination for him.) steps off the bus at his first day at boot camp. After getting the hell beat out of him by his drill Sergeant, he decides that the Marine life is not for him. So he tries to get out of it. He then meets his commanding officer Srgt. Siek (Foxx, in yet another Oscar caliber performance). Siek, is a bad ass, pure and simple. Swoford becomes a sniper. And befriends, and brands (watch the movie, it will make sense.) his sighter Troy (Sarsgard, yet another Oscar worthy performance). It follows them in the dessert from the first step off the plane until the end of the First Gulf War. No action, no politics. Swofford even says ""I never shot my rifle."" in the dessert when they find out the war was over. Simply put: Everyone regardless of your political stripe see ""Jarhead"". Sincerely, Brady"

"Sammmy02","10","1","2","5 November 2005"," a truly revolutionary war film, one of the greatest of the last 25 years
","despite the views of many people who saw this movie it has absolutely nothing to do w/ the military, government, or soldiers, this movie is an insight into the mind of one man Anthony Swofford. As a kid who skips college and joins the Marines, ""Swoff"" eventually works his way into an elite unit possibly the worlds most elite assassins, marine snipers. The movie shows you the mind of a man who trains for years to be a stone cold killer, to be able to look his target right in the face as if standing 2 feet in front of him and pull the trigger that ends their life. This movie isn't about killing people (so if your looking for a war movie with great battle scenes don't bother), it is about what happens to a man like swoff and the others of his unit, whoso sole purpose in war is to kill people, when spending years of their lives training to kill and never being put to use, then when their one chance comes to use their abilities it is taken away at the last moment. there are many who are saying that this movie is a politic/soldier/military bashing film yet at no point does the main character state anything against bush nor does he not support the war he was apart of, in fact he was thrilled to be there and only longed to do his duties. the fact is that this movie is about the mind of a marine sniper, specifically swoff. it is a great war film, possibly one of the better of all time and is acted to perfection by jake gyllenhall, peter saarssgard, jamie foxx, and others. it definitely deserves praise from all the members of our military and i expect to see it quite a few times when the Oscar nominations roll out not to long from now."

There were some really funny parts to it. Jake Gyllenhaal did a wonderful job, Foxx was great as always, but the award should go to Peter Sarsgaard. Wow.<br/><br/>Great acting once again.

"simpletonistic","6","1","2","9 November 2005"," Inside a Jarhead
","There is a very poignant scene at the end of Sam Mendes' adaptation of Anthony Swofford's Desert Storm memoir ""Jarhead."" In this scene a bus-load of marines are shown returning home from the first Gulf War, the USA-spearheaded liberation of Kuwait. The marines are being celebrated via your run-of-the-mill parade down Main Street, USA. As their bus rolls slowly down that street an older, disheveled, weather-beaten veteran, wearing what seems to be his original, U.S. Marines-issued khaki jacket, suddenly boards the moving bus. Stammering but coherent he imparts his congratulations to the returning marines, repeating the motto of the US Marine Corps, ""Semper Fi"" (""always faithful""), repeatedly. After shaking hands with a few of the marines seated in the forefront of the bus he asks if he can take a seat and ride along with them. Though no one answers him directly he takes a seat behind the bus driver.<br/><br/>Throughout this scene Mendes carefully monitors the reaction of ""Swoff"" (Jake Gyllenhaal), the 20-yr-old ""jarhead"" whose story we've followed since his enlistment into the US Marines. His immediate reaction is one of surprise. No doubt, like the other marines on the bus, initially he wasn't quite sure as to who the guy was or what his intentions were. But, once the veteran made it clear that he wanted only to congratulate the returning marines on their good work, Swoff's initial alarmed demeanor settled into a shifting feeling of horrified embarrassment. <br/><br/>Embarrassment because during his short three-month stint serving as a sharp-shooter he never shot his rifle. Horrified because despite this sharp-shooting inactivity, and lack of authentic combat duty, he still managed a nervous breakdown and a hearty dose of post-war syndrome. With but a few glances at the troubled veteran Swoff innately understood that, for all intents and purposes, he hadn't been through much at all. Certainly nothing compared to what the veteran had survived. Yet, Swoff's brief war experience had permanently dented his psyche.<br/><br/>How one reacts to that scene will tell you much about whether or not they liked this film, which is, ostensibly, the story, not a war story, about a 20-yr-old US Marine and his experience with the US Military during Desert Storm. Those who liked the film will probably have some degree of empathy for the veteran and Swoff. Those who did not like the film will probably believe that both got what they deserved when they embarked in their respective military endeavors. I believe this to be true because ""Jarhead"" is not a war movie, nor a political film, nor a polemical film, nor an ensemble film that follows a few characters in great depth. As simple as the title infers, it is the story of one person: Swoff. You'll either empathize with him or you won't. Take him or leave him. (Just as simple as that, in the story, his girlfriend back in the state drops him like a three foot putt.)<br/><br/>This is not to say that Mendes' film lacks other qualities. Towards the latter part of the film his depiction of the Marines advancing across the desert towards a handful of oil-spewing, blazing oil refineries is spectacular. Touching too the arrival of an oil-slicked, short-of-breath, soon-to-die horse that Swoff gently strokes before the horse staggers off into the desert. Mendes also depicts the bombed ruins of a seemingly endless procession of civilian-packed vehicles that were singed via a precision military strike. The ghastly remains of that violent act cause Swoff to vomit.<br/><br/>I found Swoff's story, and Mendes' depiction of it, mildly compelling.<br/><br/>After all, this is the coming-of-young-age story of a 20-yr-old enlisted in a stereotypical, close-knit military society encouraging every testosterone-fueled emotion, dream, insight, action, and reaction imaginable. We've seen this tale told in countless ""war movies,"" from ""Full Metal Jacket"" to ""Meatballs."" Mendes should have spared us the derivative training sequences and focused more on ancillary exposition giving us more insight in Swoff: what makes him tick, his family, etc.<br/><br/>Instead we are left to take Swoff, as is, in the present time. With not much to go on I found it hard to empathize with him. War is hell. He should have known that training for it and waiting for it would be hell in the suck as well."
"thom-goddard","6","1","2","9 November 2005"," Not for Jarheads
","This is one of the most beautifully crafted, moving, strong and poignant war films ever made. Sam Mendes excels with equally beautiful and horrifying images of war and machismo-soldier-making, Jake Gyllenhaal lives up to his ""next big thing"" tag (and could slip under the radar for an Oscar nomination solely for one harrowing scene where he wants to shoot a team member) with the rest of the cast providing astonishing performances and the film flows effortlessly from beginning to end and from scene to scene.<br/><br/>In the war movie genre this will be labelled, with ""Black Hawk Down"", as a modern military movie. The tale is just as much about the individual as the war. The title may draw a macho audience who will feel somewhat cheated by the ever increasing promise of death and gore that never materializes.<br/><br/>Comparisons to ""Full Metal Jacket"" are inevitable as the film is distinctly split in two parts  training and combat. However such simplistic labels are as redundant for this as they were for ""FMJ"" in the context of modern warfare. The troops battle boredom more than they battle the enemy. Make no mistake, this is an anti-war movie. You never see Colonel Kurtz's ""horror"" of war and this makes the film stronger. It is the pointlessness of conflict, soldiers killing people for a livelihood where their decisions are never under their own control. That war is absolutely good for nothing has never been so beautifully burnt on screen.<br/><br/>Here Mendes is in his element as character, instead of conflict, become the film's essence. I have never seen a film where so little has happened and I have been so gripped. A must for war movie fans and a definite for everyone else."

","Jarhead can be described in one word : Incredible. An absolutely intense and horrifying look at what being a soldier is all about. This is not anti-American, or anti-war, it's just and amazing look at on man's life during wartime. Gyllenhaal is absolutely PERFECT as Swoff, as are Foxx (Staff Sargeant), and Saarsgard ( Troy). Certain scenes make you laugh, others cringe, others cry, and others just sit there mouth open and staring. The film is a complete immersion into the life of a soldier while they are still young, in love, and scared. A definite must see for anyone who wants to see from a new perspective, or have a wonderful time at the movies. I recommend this to anyone who is ready for an experience, and a film that they will not forget for a long time, and hopefully the Academy won't forget either. Gyllenhaal is a shoe in for a nomination, and I think a win."

The elements of photography (i.e. symmetry and ""guided eye"") in this film will never be as much enjoyed on any plasma screen or high definition projector.<br/><br/>Jarhead is not a war film. It is a political film set in a war environment - executed with perfection. Until now, I had never granted a film a ""10"" rating, and I'm not even a fan of war films.

","What a mess. I don't think I've ever seen a film with so much going for it, that added up to so little. Not just the subject matter, which is ripe to be explored, especially at this point in history, but the cast and the crew of this film are all top notch. They had to have been drafted against their will to sail on this hole riddled boat of a movie.<br/><br/>***Spoiler Alert - NOTHING HAPPENS.<br/><br/>Here is a film that seems to be extremely proud to bring us the message that being in the military is hard, especially when you're away from home. That when you're away for a few monthsyour girlfriend will cheat on you. This seems to be the message. We're never allowed to see any relationship between the main character and his girl back home, yet we're supposed to feel his pain at being away from her for so long and then ultimately her leaving him. I felt far more of a bond with Mark Wahlberg's character and his wife in THREE KINGS and it was just a few short lines - but well done, thoughtful, well acted, well-placed lines. This film is a clunky mess that feels like they were making it up as they went along. There isn't much in terms of the enemy, there isn't much in terms of ""war is hell""...war in this film is just boring - if that was what they set out to prove, BRAVO. But if it is the point, they forgot that film is entertainment. Here, war is a time for masturbation and feeling bad for yourself. It's a time to complain and expect everyone watching the film to think you're deep instead of the first class spineless complainer you are. This film is an insult to anyone who has ever served in the armed forces...not to mention the chumps that shell out $10.00 to waste two hours watching it.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor. If you're thinking you want to see JARHEAD instead rent the brilliant FULL METAL JACKET a film that delivers the message that JARHEAD drops in the sand. Another choice is THREE KINGS a highly entertaining, well made film that has solid observations on the war in Iraq that resonate long after the film is over. It is obvious they were the films Mendes was trying to serve up with a few ingredients switched around and his name slapped on it. I got nothing against filmmakers who borrow...but Frankenstein's monster was just a bunch of sewn together parts without LIFE! If I sound upset with Mendes it's because I also wasted my time on The Road to Perdition! American Beauty was all Alan Ball  it becomes clearer with each passing year."

","I am a little surprised that this movie got such bad reviews, I really enjoyed it. It was an intense movie. You will either love this movie or want to cry, perhaps both. I think that the critics missed the point of this movie.<br/><br/>It is a movie about a marine who enlists and then almost immediately realizes it was a mistake. Then he gets handpicked by a staff sergeant to be a scout sniper. In the training he learns that he is actually a good sniper and gets hooked and loves it. He is then left to be bored and do all sorts of interesting rituals and craziness ensues with his fellow marines to pass the time. The acting is superb by Jake Gyllenhaal and the directing and cinematography is subtle yet moving and effective.<br/><br/>In a large part the movie is sitting around and waiting, wondering what their girlfriends are doing and being paranoid that they are getting screwed by someone else. They sit and ponder a lot about the world going by and no one caring. It is a lot about pondering the real world and what their plans are when the leave the marines."

Just to give legitimacy to my claims that this is not an accurate portrayal of Marines, I was a Marine an part of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. I feel that in a time when we have so many troops actively fighting over sees we need a movie that is going to help raise pride and morale in and for our men and women serving over seas.

I would say that the movie plot is like an ""adult film"" that doesn't have a climax and everyone is upset for that fact. Jake and the supporting cast needed their kill. They didn't get it.

But why make ANOTHER film about wartime? Or why make another FILM ? What is the point of appealing to the movies to tell us something about ourselves? If the point is time-passing entertainment, then yes, 'Jarhead' is entertaining: there is nudity, weaponry, fist-fights, comedy and mental breakdown. But if we expect to be changed, or to know more, or to verify what we expected, or simply to be overwhelmed, then we need a work of art, one which reconciles the subject and the chosen form, because the decision to use film is surely a choice. <br/><br/>Mendes' choice is to focus on the historical dawning of a new type of warfare, one in which Man the Hero-Warrior was rendered unnecessary and boredom elevated critical. In the hands of a more daring director, technique would mirror this story of boredom and alienation and uncertainty and anti-drama. And it could still be funny and beautiful and terrifying. Conversely, 'Jarhead' is an extremely easy watch, set to a pumping soundtrack, flippant rejoinders, familiar stereotypes and a tidy epilogue, even though nothing is supposed to be happening. The ""underwritten"" characters, a common criticism which I am unsure of, would make much more sense and pack a true bite if their existential world was given a chance to shine in all its dullness. But then, 'Jarhead' would risk being art, and art doesn't fill megaplexes. <br/><br/>Even when a film attempts something maybe semi-exploratory, such as beginning with a black screen and narration as in 'Jarhead', some bully in the front row shouts, ""You don't start a film with black!"" as with 'Jarhead' on opening night. Ironical or not, such an outburst is nothing more than a disruption. It is a disengagement from the start, which I see reflected in more than just movie-watching. The bully can be a layman or an academic defender, but it's all the same attitude of deferred responsibility that leads to timid art and ridiculous wars."

","Aside from the fact that there really isn't much action of any type (merely alluded to for the most part), this is one of the poorest portrayals of the USMC or combat I've ever seen. Aside from the obvious errors in language, rank and facts surrounding the young marine's experience, when they shot the scenes supposedly taken in Saudi Arabia of the troops disembarking from the 747 a/c, they could have at least cut the hills and mountains seen in the background (obviously taken in Southern Arizona around Miranda) - there just aren't many large hills or mountains in the Saudi landscape. There are so many technical mistakes (from simple words and language describing the USMC, basic and life in the service) that it is plain that the Marine Corps (nor any ex-Marine) provided any technical support. The uniforms were incorrect and improperly marked, the tanks shown weren't Marine (nor where they the correct M60s used in '90-91), the guns were often incorrect (including the guns they used to illustrate snipers), the scopes were wrong, etc. The list goes on almost forever. The most egregious errors included the statement that ""ties were still ties"" (wrong, they are field scarves) and when the supposedly fine tuned sniper scout sights into the scope and prepares for each shot, he closes one eye - - why can't they get someone who has actually shot on a range with a high power rifle to advise them on the sets. If the actor can't measure up, get some other actor. <br/><br/>Added to the purely technical inaccuracies, the amount of useless, filthy language is pointless. Sure some swear in real life, but not to the excess shown here and for what point?<br/><br/>What a disappointment of a movie. If you care to see something much more accurately illustrating life in the Corps, see Battle Cry, The DI or Full Metal Jacket. Why the latter is somewhat raw, it is at least more true in most of the facts of life in the Marine Corps.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money on this Hollywood history."

","Jarhead is a movie with great images but a lack of unity. The story tries to right itself with narration, but it still comes off as random in the end. Even so, the movie is stellar due to its unrelenting realism. If you ask, is the film more drama or action, it is most definitely drama, but the drama is simply through recklessness. The movie is very vulgar, and it fits thematically. Among an endless stream of explosions, burning corpses, incessant f-bombs, and male nudity, the film highlights the depravity of war and the insanity created in those fighting it. The acting in the film is fantastic, though there are some scenes taken right out of Apocalypse Now and Platoon. The movie is set to a popular music soundtrack, and it doesn't do much for the film. There are also some unneeded doses of fantasy. The film has flaws for the nit-picky, but its no-holds-barred attitude will endear it to most everyone."

","SYNOPSIS:
A psychological study of operations desert shield and desert storm during the gulf war; through the eyes of a U.S marine sniper who struggles to cope with the possibility his girlfriend may be cheating on him back home.<br/><br/>REVIEW:
Just like Shot Caller, I struggled to figure out how to explain the film so I put IMDB's synopsis. It's really as boring as it sounds. I think they tried to spice it up a little by adding a ""psychological study"" but I really didn't get that. I got it for two intense scenes that was the best part of the film between Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) and another character that I don't remember and can't find on IMDB to reference. The short review of this film is that I didn't care about any of the characters. That may sound harsh also being that it's a war film, but there wasn't enough pathos in the film or any relationships that connected me. Dunkirk does the same thing, but captures the army as a whole that makes you feel atmosphere and sucks you in with the others. This went the route of trying to connect to a group of soldiers and it falls flat. Apparently, Swofford and another character named Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) we're very connected to each other that you find out at the end and I had absolutely no clue that they liked each other in any way. I thought they hated each other. I was so confused as to what the emotional connection was supposed to be. I also thought the acting from Sarsgaard was quite poor. There's one scene in a snipers tower that I liked with him, but that scene also made no real sense and seemed to only be in there to have some sort of conflict in this bland and slow film. There's very little good in this film for me, but if you've seen it and enjoy it, well that's what film is all about. I personally would recommend watch Sam Mendes's 2019 film ""1917"" over this as well as every other war film that's been made. 1.4/10."

"Screen_Blitz","8","1","3","18 August 2015"," Harrowing and bold look at the life of a Marine
","Sam Mendes, director of American Beauty (1999), takes a step into the war genre with this Gulf War-set war movie, based on the autobiography by Anthony Swafford. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Swafford, a young man from Sacremento, who enlist in the U.S Marine Corps in the late 1980s. Surviving through boot camp under the ruthless Drill Sergeant Sykes (played by Jamie Foxx), Swafford makes it out as a sniper, and he and his unit are stationed in Saudi Arabia. With the 1991 Persian Gulf War erupting, Swafford and the unit are plagued with personal issues such as homesickness, humiliation, abuse, frustration, and fear of girlfriends' infidelity. This is until Operation Desert Storm breaks out and the unit find their chance to finally get the taste of what war is really all about. As explained in the movie, Jarhead is the slang term for a Marine. <br/><br/>Jarhead is not quite your typical war movie, this war is more of a comedy than an combat action-heavy film. Many war movie fans may be disappointed as this movie revolves more on how war affects the main character as well as his fellow marines than soldiers engaging in violent, bloodshed combat, with very few scenes of actual combat on screen. I was a little disappointed in some ways. Unlike most war films, the plot in this one focuses on what soldiers do when they're not in active combat. While the plot is okay, it could have been better written. There are various points in the film where the plot seems to stumble. For the most of the first half, we are treated with scenes of Marines sharing conversation about their sexual experiences, watching pornographic videos, pulling pranks on each others, comparing girls, sneaking booze and throwing wild parties. It very realistically portrays the daily lives of Marines off the battlefield. Jake Gyllenhaal's character is develops so well throughout the film, and you see as how the war begins to change him. The scene when has a mental breakdown towards one of his fellow marines gives a clear demonstration of how war begins consuming him. Gyllenhaal's performance was good, and Jamie Foxx did alright as well. I can't say their performances are Oscar-worthy though. One major flaw with this film is that it lacks emotional investment, and so while the characters' emotions are evident, they don't feel real or engaging.<br/><br/>Overall, Jarhead is not bad movie. Yes, it has its ups and downs here and there. However, it is certainly not one I would recommendable to everyone. Maybe those who are big Jake Gyllenhaal's fans would be the best people to recommend to."

The film's technical aspects are very good. When it comes to the themes and what it's trying to say, that's when it gets to be a little too murky, and whereas it's pretty much flawed.

The Gulf War breaks out, and his unit goes to Saudi Arabia for Desert Shield. After 175 days of boredom, adrenaline, heat, worry about his girl-fiend finding someone else, losing it and nearly killing a mate, demotion, latrine cleaning, faulty gas masks, and desert football, Desert Storm begins. In less than five days, it's over, but not before Swoff sees burned bodies, flaming oil derricks, an oil-drenched horse, and maybe a chance at killing... Jarhead is one of the most pointless movies I have ever seen,it's empty and hollow and there is absolutely no development.The film shows Swofford and the rest of the marines stranded in the desert, ""fighting"" an enemy they can't see for a cause they don't fully comprehend. Nothing goes on and the marines have to entertain themselves and keep a grip on reality. Jarhead is based on a book written by former Marine Anthony Swofford's where he describes his pre-Desert Storm experiences in Saudi Arabia and his experiences fighting in Kuwait.Now; while I can accept that the events (or lack of of events) that we see in the film did in fact happen, and that this is in fact, the other side of war that many of us don't know, I don't understand what's the point of this film.Jarhead portrays the marines as a bunch of dumb foul-mouthed sex-crazed drunk idiots who were trained by stupid and sadistic leaders and I don't think that's a fair image. As everywhere else I'm sure there are jerks in the marines but I'm pretty sure there is some good people as well. I'm not a marine neither do I know anyone who is and I'm not saying that I endorse the war,I just don't think that this is a fair portrayal of this people.On top of all of this in the end,Swofford says that war veterans never truly readjusts to civilian life and that they'll feel like marines for the rest of their lives. While I'm sure this is true,at least to some extent,Swofford did not killed one man, faced one enemy or shot a single bullet.He didn't experienced war in a single bit.What he went trough is the same as camping with a bunch of kids for months and now in the end he's saying that he can't let go of it? Oh the irony. On a more positive note,there are some interesting sites like the desert with the burning oil wells in the horizon and the movie does benefit from two good performances,both Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard as Swofford and Troy, but I just can't see past the lack of meaning of the story.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Oscar-winning ""American Beauty"" director Sam Mendes's new movie ""Jarhead"" qualifies more as a rowdy, sometimes unsavory Marine Corps service comedy than either an anti-war epic or a mission-oriented adventure opus. The First Gulf War memoirs of a Marine in a scout/sniper outfit served as the basis for ""Apollo 13"" scenarist William Broyles, Jr.'s faithful but politically muted screenplay. Real-life Lance Corporal Anthony Swofford had few kind words for the presidency of George Bush the elder or the contrived reasons that America sought to protect the Saudi Arabian oil fields from Saddam Hussein's marauding Iraqi Army. As graphically profane as the R-rated ""Jarhead"" may strike those innocents that never saw Stanley Kubrick's incendiary 1987 Vietnam classic ""Full Metal Jacket,"" this military movie emerges as relatively clean-scrubbed compared with the eloquent but earthy sentiments that Swofford describes in his page-turning book. Although they don't recreate Swofford's insightful saga detail for detail, Mendes and Broyles manage to capture the sense of futility that the Marines felt in a war where the Pentagon kept them hobbled in a mind-numbing state of readiness with no pay-off in terms of combat. Indeed, ""Jarhead"" combines the raunchy juvenile pranks of those salacious 1980's teenager sex comedies like ""Porky's,"" minus the naked women, with the traditional military hijinks of Marion Hargrove's comic experiences in his 1944 novel ""See Here, Private Hargrove"" about life in a U.S. Army boot camp. Unlike violent combat shoot'em ups such as Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"" (2001), ""Jarhead"" emerges as anti-climactic, because the sudden surrender of Saddam's army in First Gulf War wound up being ostensibly anti-climactic itself. Ultimately, this Desert Shield/Desert Storm movie laments the boredom and loneliness that afflicted modern warriors honed to edge of perfection and dispatched half-way around the world in a giant sandbox with little chance of showing off their lethal skills.<br/><br/>Imagine ""Forrest Gump"" in the First Gulf War, and you've got the basics of ""Jarhead."" Definitely a movie not to bolster recruiting efforts, this indulgent, two-hour plus marathon chronicles a young man's odyssey from Boot Camp to the deserts of Saudi Arabia on the eve of war. The opening five minutes when we watch Swofford submit to a driller instructor's abuse pales considerably with similar shenanigans in ""Full Metal Jacket"" or Sidney Furie's ""The Boys in Company C"" (1978). Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx of ""Ray"") convinces Swoffas he is later calledto try out for sniper school. Miraculously, Swoff turns out to be a crack shot. The snipers train until they can space three shots into a dime-sized circle on a target. Eventually, Swofford and his sniper sidekick Troy (Peter Sarsgaard of ""Flightplan"") get their chance to zero an Iraqi officer into their cross-hairs when a free-wheeling Marine Major (Dennis Haysbert of ""Absolute Power"") intervenes and orders them to stand down, so the Air Force can not only wipe the enemy officers out but also surprise the troops on the ground. Instead of seeing service, our Marine heroes languish in a limbo of sorts that exacts both a physical and emotional toll on them. ""Jarhead"" dispels many heroic myths about the American fighting man and the way he juggles the fear and anxiety that precedes combat.<br/><br/>""Donnie Darko"" star Jake Gyllenhaal is wholly believable as the title character who originally wanted nothing to do with the Marine Corps. Gyllenhaal plays Lance Corporal Swofford as a multi-faceted, down-to-earth individual who alternately appears gung-ho among his comrades as well as anxious of what lies ahead against the overwhelming numbers of Saddam's army. He refuses to imitate stereotypical Hollywood warriors, like John Wayne's invincible sergeant in ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" (1949), and creates a memorable character that stands out because he is as vulnerable as he is virile. As goofy as Gyllenhaal looks with his vacant-eyed stare, he delivers a performance that combines comedy with drama in a way that Tom Hanks excelled at before he packed on the pounds for pretentious movies like ""The Green Mile"" (1999) and ""Cast Away"" (2001). ""Sling Blade"" co-star Lucas Black stands out as a plain-spoken Texas redneck who cries censorship when Jamie Foxx's staff sergeant warns him about what he can tell the press. After last summer's debacle of ""Stealth,"" Oscar-winner Jamie Foxx has a role that he can truly sink his chops into and his multi-dimensional performance as a hard-bitten but compassionate non-com lifer. ""Jarheads"" serves up lusty below-the-belt laughs galore, muscular performances by a sturdy cast, but this occasionally fatigue-inducing, non-combat outing suffers. Primarily, ""Jarhead"" undercuts any substance that it might have had with its lightweight portrayal of Marines in limbo and the First Gulf War that it covers is as anti-climactic as the filmmakers' decision not to entangle themselves in the sticky politics that landed American's fighting men for the first time in Saudi Arabia."

","""Jarhead"" is a 2005 film directed by Sam Mendes based on former Marine Anthony Swofford's best-selling 2003 book about his experiences in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. It has been described as a film about these young men bonding in the desert, but that doesn't match up with the film I saw.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx are the big names in the film, with Gyllenhaal portraying Swofford and Foxx the staff sergeant in charge of his crew of snipers.<br/><br/>After enduring a sadistic and seemingly pointless hazing by his new cohorts, Swofford finds himself sent off with them to Saudi Arabia. There they battle boredom, heat, official stupidity and their own banality. Tormented by the meaningless routine and (justified) fears of his girl's infidelity, Swofford goes ""off the deep end"" and threatens a fellow marine with a loaded weapon before begging that same marine to shoot him.<br/><br/>As Desert Shield morphs into Desert Storm, the marines do many entertaining things, such as dodging friendly fire from above, making obscene gestures to arab women, blowing the heads off camels and posing for photos with the charred corpses of dead arabs incinerated by American aircraft while attempting to flee.<br/><br/>Finally, after much angst, the war ends without any of them having fired their weapons. So they celebrate by shooting them into the air.<br/><br/>Oo rah.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the German title for the film is ""Jarhead - Wilkommen im Dreck,"" which I guess translates to Jarhead - welcome to the suck, an oft-repeated sentiment among these thuggish semi-literates. I am accustomed to a different and, in my opinion, more accurate translation of ""dreck."" Which is not to say that this is a bad movie. In fact, it is pretty good. It is, however, a very unflattering portrayal of today's U.S. Marines. I'm afraid we've come a long way from ""Sands of Iwo Jima,"" and John Wayne is spinning in his grave."

","Sam Mendes was a wonder kid. He managed to pull in five Oscars for his debut feature, American Beauty, including Best Picture and Best Director. I was never a big fan of the film, but nevertheless, stood in awe at the achievement. Luckily, I fared better with his fantastic follow-up Road to Perdition. Of course, it only pulled in one Oscar (for the astonishing cinematography of course). When his third film, Jarhead, came out last year, I was fairly enthusiastic. I enjoyed it the first time I saw it, but it did not seem to be a shared sentiment among others. After watching it a second time, I have realized that it was still as good as the first time I saw it.<br/><br/>The film starts off with Swoff (Jake Gyllenhaal) in boot camp. The scene is fairly Full Metal Jacket-esquire with the abusive drill sergeant, and the recruits not really knowing how to handle it. This quickly moves into Swoff being deployed to marine training with his new staff sergeant (Jamie Foxx). After going through his extended training, the troops are sent out to Iraq to become ready for what would become Operation: Desert Storm. None of the troops in the desert believe they will be there for very long, but they get more than they ask for.<br/><br/>I really am still unsure what people did not like about this movie. There were great performances from Foxx, Peter Sarsgaard, a great cameo from Chris Cooper, and a much more Oscar worthy performance from Gyllenhaal. The editing, cinematography and screenplay are all top notch, and feel genuine in their sentiments of making the deserts of Iraq feel totally real (and it frightens me to know that there are parts of California, where they shot the film, that look like that). Mendes continued his streak of directing great films, and it looked like the film would pull in at least a few nominations come Oscar time.<br/><br/>But the film came and went, and it really just seemed like they had finally rejected the wonder kid.<br/><br/>There are numerous ideas as to why this happened, but none strikes me as a possible explanation more than it being advertised as a war film, and being more about the people in the war, than the war itself.<br/><br/>All wars are the same, and all are just as senseless as the next. We have learned this through history and Mendes amps this ideal up throughout the entirety of the film. The troops get pumped up for going to Iraq by watching the village bombing scene from Apocalypse Now. They even hum along to the ""Rise of the Valkyries"". A marine gets The Deer Hunter sent to him while he's stationed in Iraq, and everyone crowds around to watch it. Swoff and others get upset going through the desert, and having helicopters fly by playing music from the Vietnam war. They want an original war, but they know they cannot have it. Going on would only ruin what happens as the film progresses.<br/><br/>Yes, the film has its boring points. And yes, the pacing is not consistent in many sequences. But Mendes wanted to be different, and he managed to pull it off. It just seems like no one liked his real attempt at originality. But do not let the bad reviews allow you to not see this fine work. If anything, let it make you want to see it more. It's a great film, and is heavily underrated. I can only hope it becomes more appreciated in time.<br/><br/>9/10."

","I'm in Florida for several months and this movie was stripped off the shelves at the local Blockbuster for four weeks. After finally seeing it, the only reason I can surmise for its unavailability was the location of military bases (including a Marine base) near by. Perhaps military people would enjoy it. I found it boring and it didn't take long to get my finger on the fast forward. I was relieved to see no one got on a political grandstand. But the most striking thing was how it was shot on the cheap. This movie got acclaim and buzz. How? I think they could have shot this movie in the Sonoran desert on a Cam Corder with 100 Mexican extras with perhaps one scene in a Baja junk yard. The only Arabs you see are a veiled woman passing by in a car, two ""Officers"" in a distant tower, and five guys with camels in the distance. I imagine that scene was done from a distance because up close they would be revealed to be blonde-haired surfer dudes and guys in camel costumes. You never see an Arab up close, because...surprise! They didn't hire any for the film. There were some ""crispy critter"" dead guys that could have been done about as well in any Halloween fun house. Reviewers marveled at ""Spectacular Cinematography"" in the oil well fire scenes. That was all stage camera work in front of a screen. They had film of actual oil fires and put the actors in front of it with fans and ink spray. John Wayne was acting with the same technology over 40 years previous. I was looking for any authentic military equipment. Was that a WW2 Sherman tank? I thought they had Abrams for that conflict. It definitely wasn't an Abrams. Maybe it was Jose on a beefed-up Toyota. It's amazing what Jose can do with paper mache; you should see his piñatas. Boo-ra, senor. I was waiting for some guy to change its carburetor (tanks are diesels with out carburetors) like B.A. Baracus (Mr. T) did in the corny TV series ""The A Team."" They mentioned tank killer jets, but I didn't see a single plane with the distinctive two-engine profile of those planes (they were A-10's or something like that, weren't they?). I don't even think their sniper rifles were authentic. AS a matter of fact, I didn't see a single authentic military aircraft of any kind. Maybe I missed it, but where were the aircraft? They should have pulled Kit out of storage from ""Knight Rider"" or something. ""I think the Ahabs are beaten, Michael! Semper Fi!"" Also, there was a definite feeling that the Director tried to borrow from 'Full Metal Jacket.' That undercurrent wasn't even subtle. It was pathetic, however. This movie is for the really, really bored, and perhaps the really dumb. I suggest you read the book if you want to get the feel of this man's story and forget the movie. And if you want to see a really good contemporary war film, watch FMJ. Well, you've already seen it. Haven't we all, and look forward to when some one will finally make a good war movie again. If you've seen it ten times, it would be better than watching this bomb for the first time....I'm adding this after my review was posted and as a final comment. I've read others' reviews now and posted additional comments on other threads. My final comment is this: this is a psychological art film/anti-war film masquerading as a war flick. Even if you like art films, this is still boring and lacking coherency both in content and scene sequence. Production values were low, and technical authenticity was bogus. Fairly good acting talent was wasted by a poor and erratic Direction by Mendes and an equally lousy screenplay. It's also being revealed that the author probably lied about his experiences because his comrades are not backing up his facts; thus fouling anything the film was trying to say (or not say). I wasn't impressed by the author in his appearance on ""The Daily Show"" either. His interview was as boring as the flick.....One last comment, because I dwell on the technical stuff in films. What kind of incoming rounds were those? They were really weak to the point of being ridiculous. Any mortar round would shred anyone that close. How can they get away with such obvious technical flaws and be considered anything but ridiculous? It's like a stage play put on screen. I have no political agenda with my commments on this film. I opposed the current occupation of Iraq even before it occurred...this is just a crummy film. Jamie Foxx has a great future, though."

","If this is really what the Marine Corps is like today, it's no wonder everybody's kicking the US's butt wherever we go. These guys were portrayed as weak in many cases. These guys were cracking up before they went into combat at all. I'm sorry, but when I was in, the Corps was a bunch of tough men. Vietnam was our war...and there was beaucoup action there! The depiction of those Marines in this film almost made me sick. Sure, Marines are human beings and have feelings. Sure there are Dear John letters from the girl who was going to wait for you. But you get over it and move out. This clown got all crazy and he wasn't the only one. Gunney Washburn, PLEASE WHIP THESE WIMPS INTO SHAPE because someone didn't do it.

"Blade_Le_Flambeur","6","1","3","15 November 2005"," Muddled plot with some a strong performance makes Jarhead a mediocre film
","'Jarhead' is the latest film film from Academy Award winning director Sam Mendes ('American Beauty', 'Road to Perdition') about a Marines unit during the Gulf War. The story revolves around sniper Anthony ""Swoff"" Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his scout friend Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) as they serve their tour of duty in Iraq. They are commanded by Staff Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Foxx), a tough-as-nails leader who demands complete motivation and hard work. As the film progresses, the viewer begins to understand more and more the situation that Swofford and co. face.<br/><br/>The Gulf War was very short - only four days and the film makes a point about this. Swofford and Troy are trained to fight against the Saddam Hussein's troops who have invaded Kuwait only the war is over before they can actually kill anyone. Swofford wrote an autobiography of his experiences about the futility of training young men to fight without ever actually giving them the opportunity. However, as interesting a point this is to make the film ends up feeling muddled and dull.<br/><br/>In the Stanley Kubrick film 'Full Metal Jacket' the viewer sees Marines being drilled to become perfect, mean, killing Marines and perhaps even robots. The difference between 'Jarhead' and 'Full Metal Jacket' is that the former does not devote as much time to build up this vital plot point. There are scenes that involve a drill instructor and a boot camp but they are not nearly on the same level and intensity, nor does it really push through the plot. The entire film talks about the daily boredom the Marines face in Operation Desert Shield then Iraqi Desert Storm as they eagerly wait for the chance to shoot at the enemy. However the film feels stretched out and has some bizarre scenes that apparently serve as metaphors. As someone who has not read the novel I can not accurately comment on whether or not the film incorporated the elements from the novel although screenwriter William Broyles Jr. ('Apollo 13', 'Unfaithful') seems to muddy up several scenes. The viewer gets a sense of the irate atmosphere but that does not mean it has to be dull and long. Although this is the main flaw of the film, there are some positive elements.<br/><br/>Sarsgaard has proved himself a capable actor in films like 'Garden State' and 'Kinsey' and here he lives up to the reputation. He has one very emotional scene towards the end where he perfectly delivers the difficult emotions and his frustration with the situation. Gyllenhaal also proves himself talented although it feels as if he is a pedestrian, and as if he is the lenses for which the audience sees everything through. Oscar winner Foxx also plays his role with solid charisma, although he is given less to do than in his sublime performances in 'Collateral' or 'Ray'. Other notable cast members include Chris Cooper as a Lt. Col. and Dennis Haysburt as a Major who causes some big problems for the main characters. There are also some impressive technical elements.<br/><br/>Ace director of photography Roger Deakins has some striking images such as burning oil fields and the dry heat of the desert frustrating the Marines. Editor Walter Murch is able to inter cut splice in some nice imagery throughout although as mentioned before the film drags it's heels. Mendes expressed admiration for how Kubrick directed 'Full Metal Jacket' in previous interviews concerning the film. His admiration shows very clearly. He wants to make a strong point with 'Jarhead' without the messy elements of politics or modern day comparisons. And to some degree he succeeds yet at the same time the film feels disconnected. In 'Full Metal Jacket' there are some stark and fascinating caricatures of the Vietnam Marine yet Kubrick somehow infuses a life into those characters. <br/><br/>'Jarhead' is not necessarily a bad film, nor is it really a good film. It's mediocre and while the murky plot elements drag it down, Sarsgaard impresses very much and the visual elements are a plus. In some ways, it just could've been done better.<br/><br/>6/10"
"evanston_dad","7","1","3","15 November 2005"," As Unfocused as the Gulf War Itself
","""Jarhead"" is like a ""best-of"" compilation film of other classic war movies. At different times, it reminded me of ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Full Metal Jacket,"" and David O. Russell's ""Three Kings,"" among others. The problem is that it never achieves a style or point of view of its own. As a narrative, it's as unfocused and messy as the war it's about. However, it does manage to send you out of the theatre remembering specific images or moments, so in that way it's effective.<br/><br/>Director Sam Mendes obviously wants us to feel the way Martin Sheen's character does in ""Apocalypse"": adrift in a surreal nightmare. However, the difference between Coppola's film and this one, and what made the former successful and this one less so, is that even among the madness of Vietnam, the protagonist of ""Apocalypse"" had a distinct purpose. The movie was moving toward an eventual goal, which gave the chaos of the rest of the film some foundation. In ""Jarhead,"" it's all chaos and no apparent goal, which Mendes seems to be saying is the point of the Gulf War in general, but that doesn't necessarily make for a compelling film.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that the characters in ""Jarhead"" remain virtual nonentities. They are the stock characters of any war film, easily described in one-word summaries: the ""crazy"" guy, the ""sensitive"" guy, the ""jaded"" guy. We really learn nothing about the central character played by Jake Gyllenhaal, and what we do learn about him is wildly inconsistent.<br/><br/>The entire film feels vaguely critical of American military policy in the Middle East, but it never sharpens its critique into any point that has impact. This isn't the first time Mendes (a British director) has pointed his criticism at American values and left me wondering what point he's trying to make. David O. Russell does a much better job in ""Three Kings,"" because he introduces an opposing point of view to American actions. ""Jarhead"" is so insular, so focused on a bunch of kids that don't have any point of view, that we don't really have a point of view either.<br/><br/>But as I said earlier, there are some very memorable sequences in this film, and even if they never really coalesce into anything of substance, taken on their own they have their own emotional impact. I particularly liked the sequence in which the soldiers are being interviewed by American media, but are coached beforehand on what they are and are not allowed to say. That's a much-needed reminder that we at home are likely never really getting the true story of what's going on in foreign lands. Other images, like a horse covered in oil, wandering through burning oil fields; or a highway full of charred cars and bodies, everything still frozen in the exact position it was in at the moment of destruction, come close to equaling some of the images Coppola gave us in his film.<br/><br/>America has dug itself into a hole in the Middle East, and who knows how or when we're going to be able to dig ourselves out of it. ""Jarhead"" wants to add yet one more dissenting voice to our country's actions, but it doesn't really have anything new to say. If its words were as good as its images, I would say it could be a terrific movie. As it is, it doesn't have the stuff to join the list of all-time great war films.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","JARHEAD (2005) **1/2 Jake Gyllenhaal, Peter Sarsgaard, Jamie Foxx, Lucas Black, Chris Cooper, Dennis Haysbert. Not bad adaptation of Anthony Swofford's best-selling book account of his stint in the Marines during the first Gulf War where tedious waiting for action goes hand in hand with the brutal facts of war: war is hell. Somewhat predictable and akin to a softer version of ""Full Metal Jacket"" without the overwrought carnage. Gyllenhaal acquits himself as Swofford, a jacked up but no account to his own standings in the grand scheme of things and Sarsgaard as his fellow grunt has some nuanced low-key moments that counterbalance his one fine sequence of a meltdown that best sums up Sam Mendes' wait-and-see direction while William Broyles' adaptation seems half-baked at best."

","This was a perfect film. Most often after I see a movie in a theatre I can pin-point which parts I thought lacked, and could have even ruined the rest of a great film. But there was nothing wrong here.<br/><br/>From Mendes's direction, to Gyllenhaal's performance (didn't think he had it in him), to Deakins' cinematography (who could have doubted it'd be amazing?), and even Thomas Newman's score (another collaboration with Mendes) and Murch's editing did the job.<br/><br/>Now, I do think there was a message here that some of the other reviewers have failed to see. When he is in the bathroom and he looks in the mirror to see that his face is replaced by his institutionalized sister... I mean, come on, obviously our narrator feels trapped by the war he's a part of, and in the end we find that it meant nothing to him in the end.

","Alright, I have never been in an armed service and never plan to be. I thought I should say that before I started.<br/><br/>To the people who thought that this movie had no plot or conclusion I say to you: NO, REALLY? This movie struck me as essentially a first person documentary, and a truly good documentary should simply present ""How it is"" and not make any value statements. That is this movie to a ""t"" in my mind. It simply presented everything that the writer (a marine) felt or experienced (or heard about one would guess from the sheer scope of it all). Essentially, the viewer is overloaded with everything; Swofford seems to try to dump this part of his life into you brain, and I think did an excellent job. When I left the theatre I essentially felt, OK yes... The meaning of this film is what you make it.<br/><br/>As to the accuracy of the events and portrayal, i cannot say. However I found it interesting that there seem to be many marines who have responded and seem to be evenly split as to the accuracy (what does this imply). I would, however, like to say for what it is worth that the characters in the movie are simply portrayed as human. They all have failings, weaknesses, and simply fly off the handle occasionally. If this in some way besmirches the ""infallible hero"" image of a marine GOOD. I am sorry if that remark cause offense, but sad to say that you are still human. Marines may have a tough job, i'll certainly grant them that, but if that is to imply that everyone is to ignore the fact that they are just as human as the next person, I believe that to be a worse disfavour.<br/><br/>Well, overall, this was an excellent movie. Odd as it may sound, it was a war movie that achieved greatness through understatement (one may not believe it to be possible).<br/><br/>As to others comments: I found it funny the people essentially whining about the language and sex. Umm, you send people out to die and you think they are going to worry about profanity? There was so little war, others complained.... that was desert storm, what did you expect about a movie about Desert Storm? And the worse ones: Oh no, your questioning the impeccable facade of the armed services... your Un-American. Folks, we buried Mcarthy along time ago, true his legacy has never died, but really: America = freedom = allowed to say anything you want. Especially, allowed to THINK anything you want.<br/><br/>Go see the movie, thats all i can really say, as it seems to be one that is a very individual experience."

","I had personally been looking forward to this one years ago. As soon as I heard Mendes (director) and Newman (composer) were teaming up again to make a movie, you can bet I got giddy ""ricky tick"". Boy, those two son's of b's didn't disappoint. This was only Sam Mendes' third piece of direction in his career. Simply an astounding young record for this guy. First, American Beauty, where he won an Oscar for Best Director and Best Picture. Then, Road to Perdition which we all know and love. And now Jarhead. Thomas Newman pumped out kick-ass Oscar nominated scores for both of those movies, and much to my ecstasy, a bitching composition for Jarhead. A bold and bad-ass concoction of rock, middle eastern and farther eastern music. For all you soundtrack geeks out there, this movie is worth a look simply for its score.<br/><br/>But enough about the behind the scenes action. Nobody cares about that. What we all care about is seeing Jake Gyllenhaal naked, and yes, that scratch will be itched my friend. Just picture Santa, drunk, chiseled and with an M-16 rifle and there you have it folks.<br/><br/>Among some more interesting scenes, were, in typical Mendes trippy form, an odd, but mildly intense bathroom scene, where Swoff (Jake) has visions and starts puking sand. Another of my favorites is a very poignant scene in the burning oil fields, where Swoff (Jake) finds a lone horse. The meaning and density of that scene is still rattling around in my head.<br/><br/>The politics of the film are very interesting, and i'm sure the z-man will touch upon this, but for me, the psychology of it sent my sparks flying. Watching intense group norms emerge quicker than you can say ""hu-rah"" and seeing a soldier reach a psychotic break down after being denied the opportunity to aid a fellow soldier snipe an enemy were among the most strong and prevalent psychological gears at work.<br/><br/>Overall, this character driven film turned out to be a modern Full Metal Jacket, with a little Mendes Madness factored in. But that is put very simply."

","OK, I finally got to see Jarhead. I've been waiting sometime to see this film. I'm a big fan of Sam Mendes, having love both American Beauty and Road to Perdition. I also like war movies as well, my favorites being Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, and Black Hawk Down. Upon seeing the trailer, a friend of mine noted that this looked like ""Platoon, only in Desert Storm"". Sure enough, it did. So, color me surprised when I read an Entertainment Weekly article which said, ""A War movie with no combat, mostly waiting."" I thought What? What kind of movie is that? Still, I went anyways, thinking it might at least be kinda good. Sure, this movie takes its time getting to its point, but it helps to put you in the mindset of the Marines. BTW, I've been reading some of the posts on here about this movie having no politics, and being anti-American. This is stupid, obviously these people did not understand the film. The point was, at least to my understanding, that you have to sacrifice yourself, who you are, to become a killer for the Marines. You hope you do it for a good reason, to protect your country. The guy here, however, ultimately thought he sacrificed everything and got nothing. This is not anti-Amercian. Maybe an unflattering look at Marines, but this guy still loved his country and wanted to serve it, but was never given a chance. There also seemed to be a slight commentary on the ridiculousness of war, but it wasn't a main focus. This is a great film."
"mdbento","9","1","3","8 November 2005"," Not Your Typical War Movie
","I went to see Jarhead on Friday afternoon after reading the recent Harper's magazine profile essay on the film and the problems associated with anti-war films. I first became familiar with Swofford's memoirs about his service in the first Iraq War primarily because of Swofford's legendary party-session with University of Kentucky grad-students after a Lexington reading.<br/><br/>The setting: Melissa and I showed up at the 3:20 pm showing at the Regal theater (a typical shopping area multiplex). Arriving somewhat early, there were only two other people in the screening area and I thought that this might be a typical early-Friday screening (the last afternoon showing we had experienced was The Constant Gardener which had only six people in the audience).<br/><br/>Slowly groups of 2-4 people filed into the theater until there was about 20+ people. At about 10 minutes before the showing three groups of 12+ people showed up, obviously, from overheard conversation and their collective-huddling, they were the local fraternities come to check out the latest war film.<br/><br/>The audience was easily 90% male and, as Melissa noted, the testosterone blanketed the theater. One could sense that they were there for some action and some butt-kicking. In my imagination I heard them rallying the guys to go see the film: ""Enough of the daily reports of violence and death in the current Iraq-war, lets go see a film about the one where we kicked some serious ass!"" The film (general comments because I don't want to ruin the plot): This film is going to produce extreme reactions. It will be one of those polarizing films that will be an ideological litmus-test of the people who watch it (like Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing) because it doesn't make an explicit stand either way on this war, or war in general. It simply presents Swofford's personal story of training to be a Marine scout and his experiences in the first Gulf War.<br/><br/>A lot of commentary I have seen is that this film (and Swofford's book) is anti-military. I don't see it... yes it exposes the cruelties of collective male-bonding that is centered around the hatred of an ""enemy-other,"" but is that really shocking to anyone? It portrays the insanity and dehumanization of contemporary warfare in which buttons are pushed and hundreds of people are immediately incinerated/blown-up, but is this unrealistic? It depicts the trauma experienced by those who serve in the military, but one only has to read studies of post-traumatic syndrome all the way back to WWI to realize this reality.<br/><br/>What I think is disturbing about this film for many of the people attacking it is that it de-mythologizes the glorification of personal combat--the individualistic hero-figure who rises above even the screwed-up absurdity of the military situation, bringing order to the madness. In this film there are no heroes. Even Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket, perceived as anti-war films, allow us points of identification and characters we can ""root"" for in their quest to make sense of the insanity of war. In Jarhead, there are no places we can rest, we are kept disturbed, we are uneasy, we really don't know what is going on, perhaps the military terminology best suited to the atmosphere of the film is FUBAR.<br/><br/>The audience after the movie: As we walked out you could sense the frustration of the bands of fraternity-boys who had sought the glories of represented warfare. They complained loudly that the film lacked the spectacle they had come to experience. I wondered, how many of these boys, from their fraternity-association and position of privilege in our society, would ever have to worry about serving in the military. Why, if they were so lucky to escape this service, unlike their less-fortunate peers in Iraq, Afghanistan and other parts of the world, was it so necessary for them to feel a part of the rituals of war, even if it was through the spectacle of a Hollywood film. As we walked out many of them were on phones planning the night's parties, their frustration so evident, I wondered how it would manifest in the night to come."
"uncle_loren","6","1","3","7 November 2005"," The Anomaly That Is ""Jarhead""
","Jarhead"" is an anomaly of a film. Based on a book that details the account of one man's experience in the Marines during the first Gulf War, ""Jarhead"" is paradoxically neither a war movie nor an anti-war movie. It is instead a psychological drama about the torment of waiting for war to begin. And in this case, the ""waiting"" being the waiting for the war that only lasted a week, ""Jarhead's"" significance is lost in light of contemporary context and recent political contradictions. Nevertheless though, as one Marine in ""Jarhead"" so bluntly puts it, ""Fuck politics. We're here now. All the rest is bullshit.""<br/><br/>Therefore with that being said, ""Jarhead"" as a cinematic entity in itself, is a work of art. ""American Beauty"" auteur Sam Mendes brings an elegant sense of style and humor that elevates the movie from its psychological premise to a series of somewhat more familiar experiences to the viewer. For instance, by including scenes of male bonding, Marine life challenges, and ""missing your girlfriend/wife"" masturbation, Mendes creates a portrait of what being a Desert Storm jarhead must have been really like. His direction coupled with cinematographer Roger Deakins's eye for mirage-like, visually sumptuous images make ""Jarhead"" seem like more than the sum of parts.<br/><br/>Alas, Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as author/narrator Anthony Swofford, does not add to this equation, however. While Gyllenhaal performs admirably, the range of emotions he is supposed to go through by the film's end, do not feel distinct enough so viewers ever feel the change he's gone through is real. Nevertheless though, brilliant supporting performances by actors such as Jamie Foxx, Peter Sarsgaard, and Chris Cooper all make up for this by adding wit, pathos, and respectability to their roles. Sarsgaard, in particular, standing out for his performance, as Anthony's bloodthirsty, psychologically troubled colleague, Troy. <br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Jarhead"" is an unfortunate disappointment. A work of art filled with beautiful imagery and sprinkled with several brilliant performances, yet nevertheless confounded by its lack of action scenes and its message's historical context, its anomaly is its own downfall. A really ambitious and thought-provoking film, ""Jarhead"" makes the torment now of people waiting for a real ""war"" film all the more anxious. Welcome to the suck, ladies and gentlemen; we might be waiting awhile.-- 6.5/10"
"PTonyH","10","1","3","6 November 2005"," Sam Mendes does it again
","I hesitated to see American Beauty, thinking how much more is there to say about suburbia? I was wrong. Great movie. I hesitated to see Road to Perdition, thinking how many more mobster movies do we need? Good movie. Same thing again. I thought do we need another war movie especially now? I was wrong yet another time. JARHEAD is a great film.<br/><br/>I don't think it's anti-military at all. After all, it was written and edited by former military men. If anything, it shows the dangers they put themselves through, the sacrifices they make just so we can have the right to go on the internet and speak our mind.<br/><br/>For me, the movie was very profound. It has a universal theme we all can relate to. How to overcome one of life's greatest challenges: disappointment. Troy, a sniper, gets denied the chance to shoot the shot he's prepare for all his life. Swoff deals with the disappointment of losing his girl. The Vietnam soldier at the end dealing with the disappointment that he did not get the ""Welcome Home"" that he deserved. This movie was anything but a disappointment."

","i bought my ticket for jar-head with reservations. would i really believe that Donnie Darko could pull off the mentality of a marine sniper, one of the toughest and nastiest professions on earth second only to lion circumciser. Sam Mendes does it again. plain and simple this is a war movie that is not akin to any made today. the dialogue is as sharp as the bayonet they carry into battle. the action scenes are as good as black hawk down, and the character/actor resemblance is disgustingly amazing. Ray Charles can be a marine drill Sargent. Donnie Darko is a mentally torn apart sniper. the pure emotion that this film evokes is second only to Saving Private Ryan's first twenty minutes or the bathroom scene in full metal jacket. i gave this movie an 8 out of 10, but it was so close to a 9. it lost points in my book only twice, the startling resembles to FMJ in some of the opening scenes, and the male shower scene which is because i didn't see it coming and my homophobia was not ready for it. this movie is spectacular and will open your eyes to why we always must support our troops and malign the politicians who place the burden of freedom on the body bags of the willing."
"fred-287","Null","1","3","5 November 2005"," The real tragedy of the military is the waste of all that young testosterone....
","...Whew, lengthy summary there, but that about sums up my gut reaction to this film. There's a lot in ""Jarhead"" that may seem mysterious to someone who was never a young male who signed up for one of the branches of armed service, especially with the expectation of going to war shortly. The bulk of this movie takes place between the summer 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq and the following spring when our massed forces simply rolled over the Iraqi trenches, burying thousands of them alive (this rightly isn't depicted in ""Jarhead,"" since it wasn't witnessed by the guy who wrote the book on which the movie is based) before stopping short from ousting Saddam Hussein because Bush Senior and his crew (including Dick Cheney) correctly believed that it would lead to chaos and a Vietnam-like morass for us. (This of course didn't stop Bush Junior and his crew (including Dick Cheney) from getting us into exactly that situation twelve years later, but that's been dealt with before....) In a nutshell, ""Jarhead"" depicts all these young gungho Marines going nuts because they're not permitted to do their job, i.e. engage and destroy the enemy through fire and maneuver, or more bluntly: kill people and break things. An ""ordinary person"" may think ""So what's the problem? They're alive and well,"" etc. To the extent ""Jarhead"" has a flaw, it's that it simply relies on the realities about which the real Mr. Swofford wrote. If the viewer doesn't ""buy into"" that, then the movie won't succeed for him/her.<br/><br/>One of the many things I liked about ""Jarhead"" is that it's NOT about politics, at all. When one Marine character tries to bring that up (""We're here fighting for the oil companies,"" etc.) another character cuts that short: ""We're here now. Everything else is bull---t."" Both are correct. The character whose line that is, played by the intelligence-exuding Peter Sarsgaard, is if anything the most intelligent of the group, also the most cynical and the most gungho; in a cruel twist of fate, he's the only one of them other than the sergeant who wants to be a Marine for life, but they won't let him stay because he lied about having a criminal record.<br/><br/>If director Sam Mendes has succeeded at his task, then by the time you get to what I regard as the climax, with the two snipers finally ready to consummate their mission by shooting the Iraqi officer in the tower, you'll fully understand and embrace their reaction when that gets taken away from them. If your reaction is similar to that of the asshole Major, then I guess Mendes has failed, and maybe should have just presented it as a straight documentary.<br/><br/>Some random plug points: Sarsgaard stands out in an exemplary cast; his part is not so large as to preclude a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for him. The photography admirably transforms southern California and Mexico into Kuwait and Iraq, aided of course by the inevitable computer graphics. The scene with the Marines encountering the ghost convoy with the burned and blackened corpses is suitably eerie, although I wish movies would quit showing people vomiting on-screen because they can't get the projectile nature of it right; it looks like people spitting something out, not something being forced out. (Whenever I've had to throw up, I felt like the poor sap in ""Alien,"" only not through the chest of course.) Nice to see a war movie occasionally acknowledge ""friendly fire,"" such as that which took the life of former NFL star Pat Tillman. Near the end I liked the line ""We won't have to come back here..."" letting the sad irony just briefly resonate. The scene with the jar heads getting engrossed in ""Apocalypse Now"" was just brilliant (at Fort Benning I knew a guy who had the dialog from that one memorized). Minor quibble: the scene with Swofford threatening the other Marine at gunpoint in the tent was the only one that felt somewhat ""staged,"" where Jake Gyllenhaal seemed to be ""acting."" Like Matthew Modine in ""Full Metal Jacket,"" he has to carry the movie playing a character who seems not always believable even though (or maybe because) it's based on a real person. Somehow Mr. Gyllenhall's Swofford is always either too much of a ""wise guy"" or not enough of one.... <br/><br/>That brings me to my semi-final point: yeah, I know ""Jarhead"" reminds people of other movies, especially ""Full Metal Jacket,"" especially early on. That couldn't have been avoided anyway, but it fits with the motif of these young guys living in the shadow of Vietnam. (""That's Vietnam music,"" Gyllenhaal laments at one point, ""can't we have our own music?"") If anything I credit Mendes with making the Vietnam analogy less overbearing than I probably would have done myself. (The government did learn one thing from 'Nam though, nowadays they don't let us actually see our dead or wounded if they can prevent it.) One final quibble: ""Jarhead"" makes no reference to ""Gulf War Syndrome"" which (unsurprisingly) the Veterans Administration has been trying to downplay as much as possible, but maybe that wasn't in Mr. Swofford's book which I confess I haven't read.<br/><br/>I have an unhappy hunch that ""Jarhead"" may suffer the same fate as ""Blackhawk Down,"" another painfully meticulous rendition of an episode in our military history that we just seem to want to forget. But those two will, I believe, be in the pantheon of (anti)war movies some day, along with ""Paths of Glory"" and ""A Midnight Clear"" and a few others. Maybe the best scene in ""Jarhead"" is with the graying Vietnam veteran on the bus with the young studs staring at him politely but quizzically. ""All wars are different; all wars are the same,"" kids shooting their youthful vim/vigor wad at the behest of the ""stupid white men""...."
"druss44121-1","7","1","3","5 November 2005"," Full Metal Jarhead
","For both better and for worse Jarhead, the new film based on a 2003 best-selling book by former marine Anthony Swofford, is not just another war film.<br/><br/>That is not to say it doesn't share any similarities.<br/><br/>Like many recent films about war Jarhead tries its best to become immersed in the feeling of military life. From the locations to the sounds, everything is authentic. Important is the acting which never becomes theatrical as the performances strive to echo true marines.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal especially shines as Swoff, able to give a surprisingly subtle performance that never really cries out, ""look how brilliant and intense I am!"" The entire film is really quite subtle in this way and this lends to an overall uneasy feel that Jarhead lets unquestionably sink deep.<br/><br/>Also, director Sam Mendes crafts stunning images in only his third film (he previously made the award winning American Beauty and then Road to Perdition with Tom Hanks), as burning oil fields and sun-bleached sand dunes are displayed in full glory.<br/><br/>Jarhead even strays into narrative territory that has already been explored before. It begins much like Full Metal Jacket with a yelling and almost comically abusive drill sergeant proving the horrors of boot camp. In turn, the marines slowly become more and more eager to shoot something.<br/><br/>However, such similarities in turn compliment the ways Jarhead is actually a commentary on these perceptions of war. It is, ultimately, quite unique.<br/><br/>Unlike ""classic war films,"" such as Saving Private Ryan or Apocalypse Now, Jarhead is more about what happens when the intensity of battle never really comes. All the marines in the film are pumped up for battle, at one point actually watching Apocalypse Now and cheering as helicopters blow up targets.<br/><br/>Yet they never get this same opportunity.<br/><br/>As an audience member I found myself waiting for that big battle scene but it never really comes. And it never should.<br/><br/>You see, this is not a film for those seeking mindless action. Jarhead isn't afraid to scrutinize the bloodlust that can fill both war and people and it shows the need for this bloodlust to be quenched, whatever the cost.<br/><br/>It questions the perceptions of war that have pervaded our culture, asking if it is death and destruction that truly defines what war is.<br/><br/>With this said, some problems do arise with the film.<br/><br/>There is always a distance kept from the characters. We see that they are bored and that problems such as endless waiting and cheating spouses are their greatest adversaries.<br/><br/>Yet the characters never grow or change. Simply showing them as anxious to fight is not enough to fill up two hours.<br/><br/>Especially as some horrors of war finally begin to trickle in, such as the aftermath of a massacre in the desert, we never see the effect on the battle-ready mentality of the soldiers beyond some immediate outward emotions.<br/><br/>At the end of the war are the marines any different than when they went into it and why? What happens to all the anxiety built up within them? Jarhead never really attempts to answer any of these questions.<br/><br/>It is also somewhat ironic that this is a film released in the midst of the second war in Iraq because the war of today is a much different beast than the Gulf War. In this current war there isn't a problem of not having enough ""action."" Likely this new Iraq war is the battle that the soldiers of Jarhead yearned for while waiting in that desert.<br/><br/>The makers of Jarhead claim that they do not have any direct commentary on the new Iraq war and the film echoes this. This stress for objectivity sadly cripples some of the lasting power, though.<br/><br/>By delving into the ultimate results of the Gulf War on its restless troops perhaps certain truths of today could have become illuminated.<br/><br/>Jarhead mentions that, ""All wars are different, all wars are the same."" It is this simple yet paradoxically complicated message that best defines Jarhead while also keeping it from becoming all that it could have been.<br/><br/>Critic's Conclusion: Don't expect much action from Jarhead, a movie that focuses on how boredom and tedium can be dangerous weapons in warfare as well. Overall it is a fairly unique and thought-provoking film full of unforgettable images, though at the end there is a sense that Jarhead doesn't reach the full potential of its themes and images."
"yodelang","7","1","3","5 November 2005"," Good movie, but not up to the usual war movie par.
","If you are going to see Jarhead because you want to see an action packed dramatic war movie, you may be a little disappointed. This movie lacks the realistic fighting scenes and heart-pulling drama of the usual war flicks. <br/><br/>BUT! DO see it, because the acting is very good. Jacob Gyllenhaal's acting is impressive and proves that he is definitely going to continue to do amazing work in the future. As well, is Peter Sarsgaard, and obviously Jamie Foxx. Chris Cooper is also a great actor you'll see in the movie, although his abilities are not especially tried in his role. His character made me laugh.<br/><br/>Jarhead includes a handful of recognizable characters, as is the norm in these types of movies. An example is Evan Jones, who played Cheddar Bob in 8 mile. He basically took the exact character of Cheddar Bob and threw on some cameo and a helmet.<br/><br/>Good movie, but I found the plot to be a little boring. I'd have rated it a 6, if it weren't for the acting. But the acting was good enough for me to recommend that you see Jarhead whether that be in the theaters or just wait till it's on DVD, since there are no incredible action scenes that you'd want to experience in a theater."
"fyrwurxx","7","1","3","5 November 2005"," More than meets the eye
","Mendes is most famous for directing films which defy social norm in terms of genre. American Beauty transcended the usual pigeonholes constructed by the modern movie-making community, and Jarhead follows suit.<br/><br/>I would not classify Jarhead as a war movie except by merit that it takes place during Desert Storm and involves United States Marines. Jarhead is a movie about people and what war (and the military mindset) does to the human beings who fight it, not about how much theater blood and computer-generated carnage they can cram into 120 minutes. If this is what you expect, then save your money.<br/><br/>Taken not as what one might like it to be and rather what it is, I find Jarhead to be, while no means perfect, a fitting addition to the modern war movie library. The acting and cinematography are exceptional; Jamie Foxx adds a very nice touch to the lineup as the Staff Sergeant in charge of the other ""jarheads."" Character development is meticulous, sometimes too much so at the cost of pace, but in the end the effort is not in vain.<br/><br/>I think the biggest drawback to the film's potential success is its somewhat misleading nature: a movie about Marines in Desert Storm demands violence abound, and this is no doubt what many people will see it for. In their unfulfilled expectation of this, they will miss the underlying subtleties each well-acted, beautifully shot scene has to offer. Many will jeer it as a film attempting to reproduce Full Metal Jacket and failing miserably, but chances are those people never saw American Beauty and don't see films for artistic value. In fact, I would even consider the movie to be anti-climactic, but again, that's assuming expectations that the film never promised to begin with.<br/><br/>Not Mendes' finest movie, but far from terrible and one I found very enjoyable."

","Jarhead I'll be the bearer of bad news and say that ""Jarhead"" will most likely not make it to the Oscars at least in the Best Picture category. Even though I highly enjoyed the film I was a little disappointed in some aspects. With the exception of one really good scene Peter Sarsgaard, the two time snubbed for two years running, doesn't give a performance that would make the Academy think to give him a makeup nomination I was expecting him to be the standout of the film and felt a little disenchanted. Maybe a little more screen time would of sealed the deal for him but it didn't. He could make it if the Academy is feeling extra super bad for his snub which I think they aren't.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx is trying extra hard after his debacle of a win last year (I know, I know you're mouth probably dropped but I really felt he didn't deserve it.) to become a serious actor. He is very good in the film but there is nothing Oscar bait about the role. It sounds really good on paper but it just isn't impressive. I loved his character because he was amusing and made certain gestures that were utterly scene stealing but nothing is ""Oscary"" about it.<br/><br/>The true problem with this film is very poor character development. I'm not sure if it's the book's fault by Anthony Swafford or the adaptation from William Broyles, Jr. but I found it very difficult to fall in love or hate any of the characters. They were all just a mere surface visual and nothing that transcribed into a full fledged character that you could take with you home . It could nab a screenplay nod if the Academy likes the film but again I highly doubt it.<br/><br/>Standout from the film was the very surprising Jake Gyllenhaal who I felt did the best he could with what he had. Gyllenhaal gave a stunning portrayal of a soldier during Desert Storm just looking for a purpose. Swofford tells the story of the marines not himself which is probably the reason for the poor character development. And by marines I mean marines in general not his platoon. Gyllenhaal is having a fantastic year and still has the baity Brokeback Mountain coming in December. Look out for a surprise double nomination at the Globes. I'm expecting great things from him in the coming years.<br/><br/>""Jarhead"" was a good experience but director Sam Mendes seems to be on a slow steady decline from his masterpiece ""American Beauty."" I see some technical categories coming up for ""Jarhead"" with a small possibility for Sarsgaard for a makeup nomination but other than that it just wasn't the Oscar story that needed to be told. It seems this year is not shaping too well as we all hoped.<br/><br/>Grade **1/2/****"

Translation: it was not anti-war or anti-conservatives. At the same time, this movie is not pro-war or pro-conservative. It simply tells the story of what it was like for those on the ground in the desert. I enjoyed this movie a lot and I hope it does well.

You couldn't get a better duo on screen like two of the best comedic performer's like Jamie and Jake. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a trigger happy sniper that wants to kill someone before he goes back home. Jamie Foxx plays his hard, but caring Staff Seargant. All in all it is a movie worth seeing Jamie Foxx and Jake Gyllenhaal were great on screen together.

This movie is a pathetic attempt to claim sympathy for a small group of knuckleheads (or as the title aptly names them jar heads) part of a overwhelming attack force whining and complaining about their lack of lives, action and engagement in an armed conflict in which they are completely redundant.<br/><br/>Why should the viewer have sympathy have over a bunch of jar heads who have no obvious character or reason for then existence other then to make that 1 glorified goal in life, to make a kill as a marine specialist. Where's the glory in that ?!? <br/><br/>Obviously the war-mongers and people thirsty for Muslim blood are gonna sympathize with this frustrations of these knuckleheads over denial over this basic reason of their existence, but at best it is a peek hole into the warped minds of those who joined the marine core. Its not filmed even strong enough to be sarcastic or a complaint against the marines life style of living even though it leans heavily on the successes of major Vietnam style movies to give it some warranty.<br/><br/>It fails to make a point or convince in its plot and in fact has a very evil premises which we are asked to feel sympathy for... Instead of making me feel sympathetic to the lead characters it left me angry and irritated at the emotions it tried to forcibly address to me !<br/><br/>2. The timing of the movie.<br/><br/>Right in the middle of the American criminal war on Iraq this movie cannot but draw parallels towards the current invasion of Iraq. Although the setting of the war in this movie is a legitimate war with clear objectives and an obvious cause for war, the timing of this movie makes this movie more of a propaganda movie for the current war on Iraq then a heroic depiction of some frustrated marines. <br/><br/>Any sympathy that could have been brought up for the personal miseries of these soldiers is lost by the realization that similar combat units today are killing women, children and parents of the same Iraqi Muslims fighting for the preservation of their culture, believes and families. <br/><br/>This is what makes this movie into such a tragic slap in the face to anyone even faintly aware of the middle east conflict that is taking place at the moment of the release of this movie."

","What is this film about? We follow a recruit played by Jake Gyllenhaal who has buffed up his body (apparently at the expense of his brain) as he goes through basic training, through to his deployment in the desert during The Gulf War. What I have liked about Gyllenhaal in the past was he didn't come across as a vapid pretty boy. He always showed intelligence and wit even in minor crap like The Day After Tomorrow. That is missing from his character of Swofford in Jarhead. Here, he just comes across as a good-looking piece of thick-witted man-meat.<br/><br/>This is not to say the real Anthony Swofford, whose book this film is based on is a dope; it just shows that the choices the filmmakers have made are dopey. We begin with voice over narration from Gyllenhaal's Swofford and we are meant to see this world through his eyes, but the filmmakers think that if they give him any kind of strong opinions, ideas or emotions, we in the audience will be alienated. I think they are wrong.<br/><br/>I was alienated by Gyllenhaal being such a blank slate. I don't mind characters in movies having definite points of view, even if I disagree with them. The one time Gyllenhaal's Swofford shows any humanity or spirit is when he threatens another Marine while reciting his ""Rifle Code"" and then asks the other Marine to kill him because he's bored. But like many others in the film, this scene goes nowhere.<br/><br/>By the time of that scene, I had already given up on Jarhead; mostly for depicting things that aren't believable. For example, during the basic training sequence, they show a recruit being killed by LIVE FIRE. Yes killed, not by heat stroke or a heart attack (which DOES happen) but being KILLED BY A RIFLE SHOT IN THE HEAD. Do the Marines really use live rounds during this type of training? Perhaps they do, but even the Marines don't like to see their recruits killed stateside during training. There would most definitely be hell to pay if that happened; yet Jamie Foxx's instructor just shrugs this death off, like it happens every day. He even yells at the dead recruit as if it was his fault for getting shot. Has this ever happened? If so, were there no consequences? Any of us who saw that situation developing would have called CEASRE FIRE! But Foxx didn't.<br/><br/>I've been in the service and I went through basic training and I know The Air Force would not have tolerated this. Foxx would have been removed from command and probably Court Marshaled. Later, another Marine kills some camels and then abuses an Arab corpse and we are told by Jamie Foxx (who was in command when the recruit got shot) that the Marines are ""not like the Army"" and they don't put up with that. Not put up with shooting a camel, but shooting a human recruit in the head during basic is OK? This is ludicrous, even for the Marines with their misplaced pride in toughness over intelligence.<br/><br/>In another scene, the Marines watch Apocalypse Now and they cheer and mimic the actions on the screen like an audience at a midnight showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show (they're even dressed like the movie characters, but that is coincidence). I don't doubt this happens, but what is the point of the scene? Doesn't any Marine recognize that Apocalypse Now is ridiculing the very same macho attitudes they are cheering about? <br/><br/>What am I to think when Lucas Black gets some hot crude oil in his eye and panics and has to be held down while his fellow Marines wipe the burning oil out of his eye? Wouldn't regular oil workers do the same if one of their co-workers got oil in his eye? Wouldn't you do the same if a co-worker got some WhiteOut in their eye at the office? What's the point here?<br/><br/>Jarhead plays like a decaffeinated version of Full Metal Jacket. In that film, we also followed a Marine recruit through Basic Training and then to war, albeit the Vietnam War. But, Kubrick's film showed the psychological devastation of what being trained to kill does to a basically decent person, but what is Jarhead saying? That if you train Marines to kill, you better let them kill or they'll be really angry? In the film, they reiterate the Marine mantra that the ""most deadly weapon in the world"" is a trained Marine. Not true. My vote is for the Hydrogen Bomb.<br/><br/>Is some statement being made about preparing guys to kill and then, at just the moment they are about to kill, you take it away from them? If there is a big meaning to this, I missed it. All in all this film just dragged on and on without any kind of statement or story. The usually good Jake Gyllenhaal was saddled with nothing to do but show off his newly acquired buff body and having him dream about vomiting sand does not constitute character insight.<br/><br/>The only interesting parts came from the supporting characters. Peter Sarsgaard once again does that magical alchemy of making something out of nothing (see Garden State and Kinsey) and Lucas Black is fine as the grumbling, but intelligent Marine who constantly questions his orders. The smart and sexy Lucas Black is just waiting for a role that will define him as an adult actor the way Sling Blade defined him as a child actor. I hope he gets it soon."

He wasn't there by force. 2) Random horses. WTF? 3) Troy dies. Why? How does this affect Swoff? <br/><br/>There's some bad boy behavior between dumb ass #1 and Swoff, but that's about it.

Aside from no actual combat, the movie was OK. However it seemed to drag on half way through and never pick up and get really interesting.

I loved Sam Mendes' other works, Road to Perdition and the modern classic American Beauty, and I went into this movie expecting to be wowed yet again. It was a sheer and utter disappointment. I never did mind a movie without a plot, they always seem to intrigue or make me think, but instead, this movie without a plot just sat. It sat and sat and sat. Nothing happens, ever. I understood that that was the point, that it was supposed to exemplify the harshly useless job of a marine in a war being fought miles away from where they are standing by machines. I got it, but that doesn't mean that there needed to be over 2 hours of footage of scenes so irrelevant from one another it was hard to decipher why exactly things were happening, or why I should care. There needs to be a catharsis, especially in war films, where the viewer connects and feels with the soldier or civilian, but instead, in Jarhead, none of the soldiers is an individual, none are interesting, and none capture any attention. I'd love to blame it only on the script, but Mr. Mendes, I believe that you have fallen. You used good actors but the whole thing fell apart instead of rose to the level your other movies were on."

The actors and the setting really set the stage for something big, but it was never delivered.

The orange disease that came out of Dessert storm in the 1990's, was never elaborated on nor radiation issues from depleted uranium tank rounds. The definition of Jarhead was accurately portrayed. Once a Marine, always a Marine was a good theme. The training and experience goes deep inside ones being. In real life soldiers have issues more than emotional and many medical due to the time they served. This is the big picture. Jarhead does not give us enough detail, nor the big picture. He is too self focused. What happened to the pills that the platoon swallowed? How many men got orange disease from Dessert storm? War movies allow public awareness with controversial issues, but Jarhead does not. Anthony Swofford used to be a Private soldier, and now public citizen-that is it."

","In order for this film to succeed you need to have a cohesive center, an actor whose personality will draw you inside the character's soul, pull you inside the illogical nightmare unfolding in front of him, and somehow leave you wondering about human nature. Instead, we are dealt a pretty sterile number, resembling an MTV video but without the pizzaz that genre usually packs. Sadly, another one of those overrated character actors tries unsuccessfully to anchor the film and falls with a louder thud than the film itself.<br/><br/>Peter Sargaard's smoldering personality and piercing eyes project the sarcasm and irony we know should be the heart of the film. However, he is not the heart or soul of the story. He is relegated to be a part of very talented supporting cast that shines at unexpected times. Jamie Fox gives his scenes the right touch, teasing us into believing this project will eventually catch fire.<br/><br/>Finally, the pastiche is a mess, a soulless attempt to bring the perspective of every man into what happened during this period of our history. One word of advice to those who can still save the business: commanding personality, a great face, and a real star. This film lacks one of those. Otherwise why do we look at the heavens? Louis B. Mayer used to brag about having more stars in his studio than there were in heaven. He knew how to play the game. Hollywood has forgotten what it is like to create a bewitching movie. It becomes enamored of people who are perfectly capable in bit parts and suddenly are being pitched as movie stars. A rhinestone is not a real diamond."

After the cuckolded Marine stalks off in rage, his comrades call him a ""homo"" and clamor to watch the pornographic footage again.<br/><br/>Swofford is obsessed with masturbation, and one scene shows him masturbating while clutching a picture of his girlfriend dressed in a skimpy T-shirt and panties (the camera watches from behind him). The other Marines seem to always have sex on the brain, too, often discussing sexual encounters in their past and making obscene suggestions about what they'd like to do to various women. At the same time they construct a ""wall of shame"" with pictures of the wives and girlfriends back home who have had sex with other men in their absence.<br/><br/>In a bit of horseplay the Marines strip off their chemical-warfare oversuits (they're still wearing their trousers) and simulate an orgy of oral and anal sex, hamming it up for visiting reporters. During a drunken party Swofford dances while wearing nothing but a Santa Claus hat over his genitals.

Watching people walk through the desert is as exciting as it sounds. The character development was OK but left a lot to be desired.

","Jarhead was a very unique film. While most war films subject viewers to mass violence, Jarhead took the alternative rout and focused on a main character and his experiences.

He arrives at boot camp and is initiated by his bunkmates with a semi-beating. Afterwards he meets his drill-Sergent and they train, and go to war. The storyline was pretty generic, but above average. The movie kept me interested the whole time and the acting was great. I would recommend it to almost anyone.

Peter Sarsgaard turns in his best performance to date and the other Marines come across as realistic. Speaking of realistic, from boot camp to the desert battles, the scenes are gripping and real...a little too real. I think some soldiers would not want to see this film to relive the harsh realities of war, but those same soldiers would want the public to see Jarhead to ""feel"" the pain they experience on the battlefield.<br/><br/>The explosions were far and few between, and the movie begins to drag as the characters...well NOTHING actually happens other than all the craziness inside their own minds. If you are looking for a film with build up that provides no solid conclusion, well this is it.<br/><br/>I expected so much more from Jarhead, and I didn't get it.

When you take away all the hilarious humour, this is actually quite an emotional film. You see the happy and carefree side of him but then you also see the darker and more emotionally tortured side of him when he finally begins to loose it. <br/><br/>The only bad thing about this film is its slowness. Not a lot happens but I guess that is the reality of the film since not a lot is meant to happen. You see Jake mess up, get punished, threaten his friend and loose his mind. But not much else.

He's not an officer, or in any particular position of authority - he's a grunt, a foot-soldier, or a 'Jarhead.' After Saddam Hussein first invades Kuwait, the US ship out their Jarheads to wait for the order to attack. This is the story of the wait.<br/><br/>Therefore, we never see our Jarheads charging heroically over the top or anything similar. It's just about the wait. Now, that may not sound like the most exciting premise for a movie, but I think that's the point. Jarhead isn't really meant to be exciting. It's more of a drama about men from lower class America, who don't really have many career options and enlist as a way of making a living.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed it.

"EarthFromObserver","10","0","1","17 May 2013"," An excellent movie, well executed.
","The first time I sat watching this movie, I expected a typical war movie. I'm a fairly enthusiastic fan of war movies, action flicks, thrillers, you name it (Not to say I like mindless action and shallow plot). But this movie wasn't what I expected.<br/><br/>This movie is based on a book written by real life marine sniper Anthony Swafford, and chronicles his time spent in the marine corps. Without giving too much away, the gulf war wasn't a particularly bloody war for western forces. Rather than showing physical battles this movie shows the emotional battles going on inside the main character and how he deals with the stresses of war. It chronicles from Swaffords reluctancy as a recruit, through the agonising boredom of waiting for action, his paranoia regarding his girlfriend miles away, his eventual experience of action, to the end of his service and how his time in the corp affected him. <br/><br/>The cast in this film is great, Jake Gyllenhaal puts forward an excellent performance which would easily have carried poor performances from lesser actors, however, in this case the supporting actors were terrific. Jamie Foxx is great as staff sergeant and his comedy shines through, as is Peter Sarsgaard, not to mention the many other good performances from the smaller roles. <br/><br/>The sound and music is extremely well done in this movie, the use of quiet adds to the general texture of isolation. The 'bleached' effect is interesting, putting a sepia and nostalgic look on things. Generally the cinematography is a pleasure to experience.<br/><br/>In summary, the film is great, the acting is great, the sound and music is great, the cinematography is great. <br/><br/>All said and done, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is purely after an action flick. It's not Saving Private Ryan or Platoon, and the action is slim, although I'd argue it at the least rivals those films in quality of experience. This movie is one you could put on your shelf and watch every couple of years."
"raiderreggid","9","0","1","11 January 2013"," Phenomenal movie
","Hadn't seen ""Jarhead"" in a while until I recently re-watched it. It not only holds up very well, it reminded me of just what a phenomenal film it is -- not just a fine war film, but a great film, period. Those complaining that it ""goes nowhere"" or that the main character ""doesn't take a stand"" are missing the point: War, and particularly the Gulf War, is not like an action movie, It is often morally ambiguous and confusing, and for those on the ground, war isn't about ""taking a stand"" -- it's about following orders, training in mind-numbing repetition, and long stretches of sheer boredom punctuated by moments of the sheer terror always lurking just beneath the surface. Despite this grunts-eye-view perspective, however, ""Jarhead"" serves as a great commentary on the insanity of war and of the policies behind it.<br/><br/>All philosophical commentary aside, the film is worth watching and merits a high rating solely for the fantastic performances by almost the entire supporting cast, with special kudos to Jamie Foxx as the hard-nosed, cool, yet sometime exasperated Sergeant, and Lucas Black as the policy-questioning, conspiracy-minded member of the platoon. I've enjoyed Lucas Black in almost every film he's been in, but I think his nuanced performance here is perhaps his finest ever. His character's non-responsive interview with the media is one of the funniest scenes in film history, and he conveys his character's traits and viewpoint flawlessly -- all without saying a single word. His wandering glances and annoyed expression had me rolling on the floor. I kid you not -- one of the great comic moments in film history. Even if you don't enjoy war movies, or don't like films with political messages, watch it just for the buildup to that scene.<br/><br/>That scene gets 10/10 stars; overall, I give the film 9 out of 10."

","One of the strangest war films ever, and I gladly say one of the best. Directed by Sam Mendes, the film wreaks of his visual feats. It's not often in this genre we are treated to such dream-like moments, but that is Mendes' specialty and he sneaks them in with great subtlety so it doesn't distract. The first thing you'll realize after watching the movie is that it's one of the few war films that depicts very little actual combat. This movie depicts the Gulf War, and manages to be quite clever in its theme, masterfully subtle. After so much training, so much hammer-like conditioning, these Marines find themselves having this programming denied to them.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal's character represents the non-conformist who can see the string he's being lead on and he suffers internally for it. That is the sum of his beautifully played character. Some people watch the movie walking away with the simple assumption it's portraying a day in the life of a Marine, but it's really doing more if you look deeper. With great visuals, like the burning oil fields, and the spectacular performance of Jamie Fox, this is definitely not one to miss."

","Someone once claimed that "" War is 99% boredom and 1% terror "" .

In that case JARHEAD is very accurate because it's an amalgamation of boredom and cliché <br/><br/>The film is based on the best selling book by Anthony Swofford . It did cause some controversy when it was published because it seemed to be full of urban myths and clichés . There is no doubt that Swoffered was a US marine and took part in the first Gulf War but some things don't seem to ring true according to opinions more qualified than mine <br/><br/>The film suffers from this . I knew long before I saw it that JARHEAD wasn't going to be a fercious war actioner in the way BLACK HAWK DOWN was but you're constantly reminded of other superior military dramas simply because they're better movies . How many people here were reminded of FULL METAL JACKET ? <br/><br/>On a technical level it's impressive enough . Director Mendes frames sequences well enough and is helped by cinematographer Roger Deakins while the cast are competent enough . The problem with the film is that it's a rather uninvolving affair with the lack of drama being replaced with clichés that you've seen before in better fictional films"

","The parallels are obvious for all to see, but especially in the obscenity-bawling drill sergeant. However, where FMJ tried to tell us that 'war is hell' and that it happens to ordinary people, Jarhead merely informs us that, never mind the story, this is a boring film.<br/><br/>I think that a good film could have been made from this book, a film that would really have shown that life in the military, even in a war zone, isn't always about explosions and death. Instead, Mendes treats us to a bunch of - you guessed it - diametrically opposed unsympathetic stereotypes that we neither care for or about. There's the usual good wholesome boy, the geek, the retarded redneck, the one with the shadowy past (he should have joined the Foreign Legion!), the professional, the immigrant, etc, none of whom are distinguishable from each other in the paucity of their character development. Equally lacking is any indication of just what these characters are doing in the USMC in the first place. The excuse for having such a disparate bunch of backgrounds in Vietnam films is conscription. Just why are these guys there? We're never told. All we are left with is the impression, that seems common from films about the US military, that the young American soldier is, without exception, a mentally unstable screaming moron with no professionalism whatsoever. Personally, I don't believe that is true, but that is how the filmmakers portray it.<br/><br/>So, leaving the cast out of the film (Gyllenhaal was good, but then he didn't really have to stretch himself), all we are left with are some pretty camera shots of sunset in the desert.<br/><br/>This purported to be a film about the 'other side' of war, the boring side.

","From the beginning of this movie it started slowly. The movie gave the image of a kid who loves sex and nothing else. The movie writers tried to make it seem real but would a kid really talk about that. Jamie Foxx puts on a good act and seams like a good Sargent but wasn't mean enough. If that was real the soldiers would have been a lot more professional and experienced. They made it as if they would have only gone into one battle. On the commercial they showed a lot of fighting which created false advertising and made it have to live up to higher expectations. It is just like full metal jacket they are beginning marines and getting ready for war but the staff srg(Jami Foxx) isn't as realistic as he could be a drill srg would not have let that man get shot and he would have also had to go to military court for friendly fire. If it were the marines the story should have been a lot longer. I give this movie a 5 out of 10. It could have been longer and showed a little more in depth into the war"
"meeza","8","0","1","10 November 2006"," Jarring!
","Director Sam Mendes' war flick ""Jarhead"" is about a battle-less war. The film is based on former marine Anthony Swofford's best-selling 2003 book about his pre-Desert Storm experiences in Saudia Arabia and about his experiences fighting ""or not fighting for that matter"" in Kuwait. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the cocky and mutinous Swofford who probably got in trouble in his uneasy childhood for going into the cookie jar way too many times without permission. However, that is not why he is a 'jarhead"". Jarhead is the term given to fighting marines. The film co-stars Peter Sarsgaard as the defiant Corporal Troy, Jamie Foxx as the hard-Knox Sgt. Sykes, Lukas Black as the government pundit Corporal Kruger, and Chris Cooper as the marine lifer Lt. Col. Kazinski. These charismatic supporting actor battalion deserve kudos for their auteur efforts ; noteworthy goes to Saarsgard though. Director Sam Mendes sets the cinematic battleground of ""Jarhead"" in the eagerness & desperation of the marines in their quest for combat in a battle-dry situation. Gyllenhaal's gritty leading performance was credible and courageous. Even though his doggy-style gay character in ""Brokeback Mountain"" broke more backs in battle than his Swofford character in ""Jarhead"". Where I do have to give medals of cinema honor to ""Jarhead"" was in its astounding cinematography by the great Roger Deakins. Thomas Newman's musical score was also right on the note target. So all in all, I say ""OOO RAH"" to ""Jarhead"" and give it a favorable recommendation. **** Good"
"tingnting","6","0","1","30 October 2006"," All wars are different. All war movies are the same
","Jarhead follows the dramatic experiences of a US marine (and his unit) during the first gulf war. The movie makes an effort to stay away from the justifications for the war, focusing rather on the effects it had on the marines involved.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed Tigerland, Platoon and Saving Private Ryan, this movie should high on your ratings list...until you watch it.<br/><br/>The film will does not make a deep impact. The experiences of the marines are shown as dramatic, but not traumatic. The casualty scenes are graphic but not shocking. The scenery should be captivating but it looks fake and digitally enhanced. As a result, it has a clinical, almost distant, feel to it. It feels like you are watching a story rather than being able to relate to any of the characters.<br/><br/>In a genre that demands powerful and thought-provoking film-making, this film is not even a shadow of Platoon or Apocalypse now. It lacks the ground-breaking style and sheer impact of either.<br/><br/>The lead actors, although talented and charismatic, don't have the screen presence nor power of delivery needed to transform the story into a memorable film. That said, Jamie Foxx turns in a wonderful performance and steals the show as the platoon leader. But he's definitely no Robert Duvall or Martin Sheen.<br/><br/>This is an interesting movie, with some touching scenes and fantastic dialogue. Ultimately it lacks depth and impact. Consequently it becomes just another movie in an over-exploited genre that hasn't seen anything ground-breaking in years."

He didn't seem very likable, respectable, wise or deep - any one of these would have helped. In fact, none of the characters seemed very appealing. Yet, the story and main character's experiences are generally interesting and engaging. Unlike other war movies, this one focuses on the pressures and tensions of the soldiers sent to fight a war. In this case it's for Operation Desert Shield/Storm. I found the seemingly realistic portrayal of what soldiers go through to be very interesting. This includes their dealing with feelings and doubts about relationships left behind, boredom, desire for combat, and tense interactions with others.<br/><br/>What I ended up getting was a pretty interesting back story to a historical event.

"emeriboy","9","0","1","3 October 2006"," A True Demonstration of Human Emotion
","First and foremost, Jarhead is a war movie, but not a combat movie. There is, after all, more than one aspect to war and this movie is a whole new kind of war movie. Rather than concentrating on killing, your friends dying, and other things often related to war movies, this movie concentrates on the relationships within the army and the pure nothingness of The Gulf War.<br/><br/>The story closely follows the book (Although in a more compact form; it mostly shows the middle of the book rather than the start and finish). Starting from boot camp and finishing up at the end of the war, throughout the plot the tensions between the men climb and fall, and the catches of being a jarhead reveal themselves. In addition, it shows the confusion and flurry of emotions that run through soldiers in war.<br/><br/>Instead of a scene climaxing with a squad mate dying (Such as in Saving Private Ryan), it might climax with an unintended accident or a fight between the men. Each scene provides another glimpse between the men and is kind of like a mini story in itself. But war is oddly absent most of the time, in fact, it's more of a sub-plot within the film, saving the last few scenes where the men's need to do something war-like sums up to one moment near the end of the movie (They did after all, join the Marines to fight).<br/><br/>The music is all what you've heard before, Public Enemy's ""Fight the Power"", Nirvana's ""Something in the Way"", and Kanye West, among many others. As for the acting, it's quite well done particularly Jake Gyllenhaal's character. The scene's are kept fresh even though most of it's in the desert, the oil field fire scenes have a creepy reminiscence of hell.<br/><br/>You should know that the first and last couple scenes go by pretty quick and seem a little rushed, mostly likely because they would've wanted to get to the important parts quickly as the movie's final run time is a little over 2 hours.<br/><br/>There are distinct parts to the movie and each one keeps the movie fresh and that's pretty much it. Well worth it."

","I rented the ""Jarhead"" video just to see what the movie industry had to offer these days about the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC), and war. (I am a retired Naval Officer with 27 years of service, several tours of which involved service with Marine Corps elements.) Boy, was I surprised! At first I had to work around the language, including the frequent use of the ""F___"" word. Because of that, I almost quit watching it about half way through. But, I stuck with it, and am very happy that I did. Subsequent to my first viewing, I purchase my own copy of the ""Jarhead"" DVD, as well as the book upon which the movie is based - ""Jarhead"" by Anthony Swofford (""Swoff""), available at Amazon.com.<br/><br/>The movie relates the USMC experiences of ""Swoff"", first in USMC Boot Camp, then in his training to become a 'sharpshooter with a STA (""Surveillance and Target Acquisition""), scout snipers platoon, and then his 6 months deployment in the 1990-1991 Gulf War against Iraq. Surprisingly, the movie script adheres to the real-life story in the book, with only slight variations. As I watched the movie, I became more and more entrenched in the unfolding life of a Marine ""Jarhead"". BTW, the term ""Jarhead"", is derived from a Marine's uniform haircut (very close on the sides and with about 1/4 - 1/2 inch on the top), which when viewed from the rear, literally looks like a jar with a lid on the top! The sometimes amusing events & occurrences in the Saudi & Kuwaiti desert are numerous, and very realistic, and do 'keep one on the edge of his seat', as they unfold.<br/><br/>I have seen this movie 4 times, and plan to view it often. Because of the exceptional portrayal of the movie's 'hero', by ""Jake Gyllenhaal"", I did a search on the internet and found that there is quite a large group of fans who have an ongoing conversation about Jake and his movie career. To my surprise, I discovered that he is one of the two co-stars in ""Brokeback Mountain"", the DVD of which I have also purchased, and watched. (I had originally chosen not to watch this movie because of its bad rap as a ""Gay Cowboy movie"".) I have since watched every movie in Jake's career, but still count his role as ""Swoff"" in ""Jarhead"" as still his best and most poingent.<br/><br/>If you are into realistic and gripping 'war' movies, with out all of the side 'crap' that Hollywood often includes in such movies (e.g., most of the movies about Vietnam), then I strongly recommend you rent or buy your own copy of ""Jarhead"" Believe me, it will stick with you for a long time."

Well, Jake is a good choice here, he plays a very good role, his acting is refreshing and convincing. But then, the film is far too long and soon starts to stumble and crawl. Anyway, there are absolutely excellent moments there. The one where the angry jar-heads try to kill at least one Arab is so truthful and chilling that makes you shudder. Or, when the jar-heads go along the desert, covered with the billows of oil smoke, black and really shocked - What are we doing here? Is the war that there is?

","After reading the reviews of this film, I decided to watch this film last night. However, it only re-enforced what I already though about the 'honourable US marine core'. The film was packed full of crude language from the start, and packed full of scenes of vulgar behaviour. It's true to say that these people are recruited from the garbage of US society, given some training (including brain washing), and then issued with guns. The thought of this frightening, especially for the poor people of Iraq, who are no doubt on the receiving end of 'payback', as one marine called it. <br/><br/>I think that the most shocking scene of the film was the Marines watching 'Apocalypse now', and humming along with Wagner's 'ride of the Valkyries'. I suppose, most of them were too illiterate to realize what they were actually doing, as Wagner's music was the official music of the 3rd Reich, promoting a mixture of homosexuality and white supremacy - it was interesting to watch the black soldiers. Watching them cheer as a Vietnamese village was destroyed, and the people murdered was sickening, and not really something that any normal person would cheer about. Although, I wonder if members of Al-Qaeda watching the attack on the WTC, would do the same. Perhaps both parties are the same type of people ?<br/><br/>I commend the producers of this film (as it should be a wake up call to the US public), and thank god that I live in Europe and never have to meet people like this."

We follow Anthony's entry into the Marines and then his deployment to Iraq to be involved in Desert Storm, a mission to basically guard the Oilfields and watch for attackers.<br/><br/>The movie shows us a bit of what life in the Marines is like, plus shows the great depth of emotions soldiers go through, from monotony to sheer horror. I was not overly impressed by the actual story, which seemed to be a bit shallow and, bar a few scenes, didn't go into great detail about the emotions and feelings of the characters. Maybe this was purely because of how the writer put his feelings to paper, but the director should have been able to portray this for him. There were a few powerful scenes, but I feel the actors, particularly Pete Sarsgaard and Jamie Foxx, were wasted. Maybe I was just confused, but I felt there was stuff there Swofford felt, but couldn't portray except done through visual, over the top scenes. Some may argue his feelings were sincere and honest and were portrayed in that manner and the director chose not to go down the usual Hollywood route of lots of unrealistic crying/great speech moments, but I'd argue then the movie should have been done in a totally different manner than as a ""Blockbuster""."

","A war film that's not decisively pro-war or anti-war. In fact, it's not really sure what it wants to be. Some parts of it are artsy, meaningful, and anti-war, while other parts are testosterone-fueled, profanity-laced, and somewhat pro-war. I think most of the problem lies with the screenplay, and thus with the novel from which it is based. Since it's basically a memoir of Swoff's time in the desert, it's not a normal fiction novel with a definitive theme and message - it's just a recollection of what the war was like. The book is much better than the movie because it includes a lot of Swofford's inner musings and reflections on war, which cements all the experiences together. The movie just seems like it took the 'coolest' scenes from the book, and threw them together, not really taking time to establish a constant theme or message. It's my biggest problem with the movie.<br/><br/>Besides that, however, it's a very well-made movie. The performances are all great, with Gyllenhaal standing out as usual. Jamie Foxx is pretty good in a surprisingly layered role, and Sarsgaard is good but not outstanding. It's directed technically solid but not that creatively by Mendes - I would have preferred more intriguing dream/fantasy sequences like when he vomits sand. The cinematography is solid, and the production design is, well, non-existent. The first third with all the training is interesting, but not really necessary. I would have preferred more time showing how they gradually lost their mind to boredom in the desert - I didn't find that part boring at all, but quite fascinating. The end with them wandering around the desert in the oil rain is where it really drags, as it seems to be trying to say something but can't quite get the words out. And the climax (?) is interesting, but not really the peak of the action. In fact, the action never really peaks - it just ends. I suppose that's true to life, but something a bit more exciting would have been nice. The denouement feels a bit rushed, too. Still, it's a pretty good film - well-made, fairly entertaining, and definitely thoughtful."

The creators leave viewers practically with no thoughts except these ones indicating that military service involves a series of pointless actions and is dull.

I liked Jake Gylenhaal a lot in this film, hes one of the rare young stars that actually impresses me film after film. I also liked Peter Sarsgaard a lot in his role and Jamie Foxx was good too. Chris Cooper was also good in a supporting role, this film has both great dramatic, comedic and cinematic elements, all the ingredients for a great film. --- IMDb rating: , my rating: 10/10"

","I was very surprised by how good this movie was as my original opinion was based on all the negative feedback from the press and Sam Mendes comment about Americans not being able to comprehend this movie.<br/><br/>I watched it, and I agree. Thats not to say if you are an American you won't understand this, but the structure, moral ambiguity, and feelings it leaves one with at the end are a far cry from Armageddon. This is the first ""American"" war movie I've seen in awhile that does not ooze patriotism and does not inform the viewer that you are watching the right side of history. In my opinion, this will (and does) make Americans uncomfortable as we (I'm American) are not normally given complex situations where we have to be our own moral compass. This is not traditionally how we have been taught to think. And this movie does not try to wrap it up in a neat little package for us to feel good about at the end of the movie as our fat little fingers finish off our extra large, extra buttery popcorn. <br/><br/>It hit me like a ton of bricks about half way through that this movie was basically an existentialist story. I have not read one review that notes that Swofford was reading Camus at the beginning of this movie. It wasn't just to inform the reader that Swofford was ""smart."" It was to give you the context of the remainder of the film. For most of the movie there are bleak themes of humanity, a lack of action, moral ambiguity, and simple to no sets. Most of the movie I squinted because the backdrop was sand. <br/><br/>Doesn't this remind anyone else of ""Waiting for Godot"" by Beckett or ""No Exit"" by Satre? Anyone? Anyone? A war movie without war. There is a comment in the movie about how others are moving on in their life while the soldiers wait in the desert. Their existence has become subjective to themselves, a classic Existentialist thought. The Gulf War was the setting for this story, but ultimately has nothing to do with it. Their are much broader ideas, like humanity, compassion, and the nature of man.<br/><br/>One drawback to this movie is the director allows for political undertones to seep through. I don't agree with people who state this movie simply lays the facts on the table. Towards the end of the movie someone states ""I don't ever have to come back to this G*dD*mn country again!"" At which point we are supposed to scoff because, we all know what happens 15 years later. One character is constantly bemoaning the fact that we are simply ""protecting our nation's oil supply."" That feeling was predominant in the most recent fighting in Iraq. But I remember the general consensus was that Saddam Hussein was a real threat when he invaded Kuwait in 1991. Thats why at the end of the conflict George Bush the first had some of the highest popularity ratings since the metric was created. I think its lazy to try to lay this conflict out in such simple terms (Well, you may, if as a director you don't complain that Americans won't understand the movie because of its complexity, but then push your own arguments in such simple terms).<br/><br/>This movie is worth a watch and I think it could be deconstructed over and over on different levels. I would start by reading the book."

","Jarhead grabs the viewer's attention from the beginning and carries it through to the ending credits. A movie depicting the harsh reality of marine going through boot camp and being sent off to fight in Desert Storm. War movies always hit hard because you know there are millions of people going through this, even as I type these words. This movie was no more shocking to the system than movies like ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". War is real. This movie has many funny parts and thank god, otherwise it would be way to depressing. It really makes you think; knowing the person who wrote the book is also the main character. I really enjoyed this movie. It makes you think and realize how messed up to world can actually be.

However, what I did see did not disappoint me in the least and it turned out to be a really nice and enjoyable surprise.<br/><br/>The story follows a young American marine (a ""jarhead"") from his time in boot camp through to and during his time in the Gulf War.<br/><br/>There were some very powerful scenes in the movie - one of which was quite sickening which portrayed the aftermath of a massacre in an isolated encampment in the desert.<br/><br/>The film did a very good job of portraying the stress the young marines were under - with tempers boiling over and the true desire and red-blooded appetite to get out into the action and experience the harsh realities of battle and war.<br/><br/>This film reminded me of the reasons why I would never have joined the armed forces. The stick and abuse these young kids got from their sergeants and other superiors was terrible, and definitely would not be something that I would be able to tolerate in any way, shape or form.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anybody, but like I said, don't go expecting a movie full of battles and blood-shed because this ain't it."

","People that see Jarhead will all complain about the same thing over and over and that is the lack of ""war"" in a war movie. When most people say ""War"" they mean shooting and large explosions, but this just tells you how stupid most people are war is not alway explosions and shooting Jarhead is a true War film it is about war. It's about how war affects the soldier's minds and i think this is the best War film i have ever seen because it does not need to rely on large Hollywood shootouts to entertain the viewers and make them compassionate for the soldiers. In conclusion, if your concept of a war movie is to focus on large shoot outs then stay away from this film, but if you want to see a war movie that is about War itself leaving out the un-necessary action but trading it with beautiful camera work and great dialog then i can't recommend Jarhead enough."
"turkam","7","0","1","16 July 2006"," Full Metal Jacket Kuwait
","Though the latest effort from Sam Mendes, whose first two films I tremendously admire, seem to borrow a bit too much from Stanley Kubrick's films- (not just ""Full Metal Jacket"") and the film loses much of its momentum in the third act, it is a good war film. One of Mendes' main strenghts is attention for detail. I had first watched the first part of ""Jarhead"" a week ago, but something came up. I re-watched it in its entirety, and I noticed several interesting tidbits, such as Jamie Foxx's character reading the bible while on the TWA flight, and the lighting during the flashback sequence, that made me appreciate Mendes' knack for symbolism and detail. The film is in many ways about the Iraqi war of today as much as Desert Storm, and it makes little effort to seclude that. While I fully agree with the politics of the film, I think it is technically well-done enough to receive admirers from those who do not share the left-of-center sentiment that Mendes is expressing. As someone who appreciates Westerns, I loved many parallels that this film has with films like ""The Searchers,"" including a magnificent shot of two soldiers in the desert with the sun in the background. The cast is fairly good. I think Jamie Foxx is the one who is most in character at all times, but there are no weak performances at all. The film has many overt references to other war films, including ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Apocalypse Now!"" but in addition to 'Jacket' there are some similarities with films like ""Platoon"" and ""Coming Home."" I suppose if the line in the film that says 'No two wars are different. No two wars are the same"" is accurate then one could add ""No two war movies are different. No two war movies are the same,"" as well."

Not all wars are meaningless, not all people in this modern world of ours are without a sense of what is good, what is right and worth fighting for. Furthermore, I refuse to buy in to the overt simplification and to believe that all US Marines are basically retarded morons.<br/><br/>I have read the book, and even though it is not one of my favorites, it is very much different from the film, as books usually are.

"Boba_Fett1138","9","0","1","9 July 2006"," The madness of war...without war.
","It's amazing. This movie does perfectly show the whole madness of war...only without the war elements. No fighting, action or shooting is present here. Only a couple of well trained and motivated U.S. Marines who are getting more and more bored and fed-up and slowly start loosing their minds in the deserts in the Middle East, during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. The movie does a very good job at creating and making this sort of madness believable and sensible in the movie.<br/><br/>Just imaging being trained hard for months for something extreme that takes lots of expertise and skill and eventually getting deployed for fulfilling these tasks but in the end being never able to show and use these skills and expertise you trained so hard for, for so long under often extreme conditions. Waiting and preparing for something that never comes. Wouldn't you slowly start loosing your mind and be annoyed and bored at least? This is exactly what the story of ""Jarhead"" is about. Drinking water, moving over a hill, drinking water again and then some more, all over again without ever fighting or encountering an enemy. It all feels so pointless and it's a killer for the motivation. The Marines in ""Jarhead"" all slowly start to see the pointlessness and irrelevance of their mission and they abandon all hope that they well ever get to use their skills and their hard training. So they start concentrating more and more on different more trivial issues and 'crazy' pastimes.<br/><br/>This movie shows that people are people. Nothing in this movie is story is black or white. Its realistic and therefor the events and the characters of the movie become sensible and also understandable.<br/><br/>The movie is not an heavy drama. At least not as heavy as you might expect after reading this movie its plot line. The movie is told quite lighthearted and fast paced. Therefor it manages to become an entertaining movie to watch, despite its heavy and serious theme. If you have already seen the other Sam Mendes movie ""American Beauty"", you already know what sort of dark, realistic, subtle and unusual sort of humor you could expect.<br/><br/>After browsing around a little I find out that most of the people who didn't liked or even hated the movie had problems with the portrayal of the U.S. marines in the movie. They were offended and call it unrealistic and not fair toward the Marine Corps. However when you ask a random U.S. Marine, who was active in the first Gulf war around the same time period this movie is set in, he will tell you that this movie is fairly accurate and most of the Marines really behaved the way as presented in this movie. Even some Veterans active here on IMDb who expressed their opinions and feelings about this movie, confirm this. Doing a bit of research before commenting and expressing your hatred or your opinion in general about a movie, is never a bad idea. Just a friendly little word of advice toward a couple of fellow movie-critics here.<br/><br/>The movie is absolutely beautifully crafted. Sam Mendes style of directing is detailed with eye for realism, credibility and entertainment as well. He tells the story with lots of style as well. Just also look at the amazingly wonderful cinematography by Roger Deakins and the nimble editing by Walter Murch.<br/><br/>The acting is great although most of the actors are too old for their roles. Most of the Marines are supposed to be around 18-20 years old but most of the actors that portray them are above the 25 or older. Jake Gyllenhaal fits the main part well and delivers a good performance. Jamie Foxx was yet again brilliant and he at least deserved an Oscar nod. Also great was Chris Cooper in a small, perhaps even cameo-sized role.<br/><br/>An impressive, though provoking movie about an interesting and relevant subject, that yet, is also entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Minkwan","8","0","1","1 July 2006"," Insanity in the Desert
","This is Sam Mendes third feature and it is his third incredible film.<br/><br/>Jarhead is not so much a war film, but rather a film about war, the gulf war. A war which was fought in the air, rather than on the ground, face to face.<br/><br/>The film is about how war, whether or not you kill someone, destroys the souls of young men (and women, although there is little doubt that this film concerns itself with testosterone.) It is about how aimlessness, and remoteness will send someone insane. It is about the average man who is expected to be too much, be too good, too tough, too malleable and who expected to take commands without question. It is about how wars tear families apart, destroy relationships and ultimately affect the relationships one builds in the future.<br/><br/>This film is full of tension. Mendes gradually raises the feeling claustrophobia and of anxiety, which is met with devastating anti-climax.<br/><br/>The film is aware of its place among the great American war films of the seventies, utilising an intelligent quoting of Apocalypse Now. The Young soldiers, or Jarheads, triumphantly recite the Ride of the Valkeries without any irony. Although the scene is obviously ironic. The Deer Hunter is also quoted, both films being anti-war.<br/><br/>Roger Deakins brilliantly emphasises the malevolence through washed out looking scenes which cry with the hint of colour. The desert, the wide expanse of nothingness is filmed so accurately so that it becomes troubling.<br/><br/>Gyllanhaal is brilliant, two fine performances in one year, as too is Foxx and Sarsgaard and Cooper in a small part.<br/><br/>Not a perfect film by any means, but a film which has important things to say, which says them articulately."

His girlfriend cheats on him while he is gone, and when he finally comes back home, he is a changed person.<br/><br/>I found this movie very good in its expression of the fears and frustrations of war.

","Initially, I expected a lot more action.<br/><br/>But as the movie progressed, I was glad there was close to none, as the tensions between the soldiers, and the waiting builds to a climactic anti-climax (sic) that in my eyes makes the movie so much better than any fancy effects and grand action sequences could possibly do. <br/><br/>Remembering what it was like to follow the build-up to the rather short war, the media sequences are rather funny as they add to the surreal feeling of ""Vietnam-light"" where the media are seemingly omnipresent, but compared to Vietnam they are also impotent. (In GW Mk I there was a ""media pool"" and I remember the most we saw for rather a long time was planes taking off and landing). <br/><br/>9 out of 10 in my book for very good directing by Mr Mendes, and all round good performances by the cast"

Accompanying with stars like Jamie Foxx, Peter Saarsgaard and Mendes' favorite Chris Cooper the film cannot be bad. Friendship and loyalty is important in the film. The cast do great job with competent director's guiding.<br/><br/>After the film you can't help at feel somewhat sad that how all things turn out but it gives the message that after being in a war boys become men. With the fact that movie's based on memoirs of real Anthony ""Swoff"" Swofford increases the value of the film.<br/><br/>Nice work. ""Play it again, Sam!"""
"davideo-2","7","0","1","13 June 2006"," Mendes hasn't reached his master-stroke with this one but he's made a good and memorable film all the same
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br/><br/>Adapted from his own novel of his experiences during wartime, the film tells the story of Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) a young man who enlists in the army as the Gulf War takes off. Sent to a post in the desert with other members of his unit, they don't find a war taking place but just a need to be on constant alert. Their Staff Seargent Sykes (Jamie Foxx) trains them to be brutal killers in combat and a life or two was even lost in training- only for them to face nothing actually in the way of danger. The film becomes a study of how these men, namely Swofford, cope with the pressures of being on constant alert and the unbelievable boredom that breaks out as they sit around expecting the fight of their lives, only to return to a victory parade without having the honour of having faced any combat for their country.<br/><br/>Brit director Sam Mendes hit it off with the unforgettably powerful American Beauty, but he followed it up a few years later with the gangster flick Road to Perdition, which, in my eyes anyway, was a bit under-whelming. This new film of his is shot in a style and told in a way that is unlike his previous two efforts, with a slightly more docu-drama style, some might say. It's a strategy that pays off, fairly well.<br/><br/>The film has a few quietly absorbing moments to it, as well as a few powerful and disturbing scenes from lead star Gylennhaal. If only his co-stars were as good, unfortunately, they're mostly all wasted in supporting roles, most notably Chris Cooper. Foxx is commanding in a co-starring role but even he seems to have limited screen time.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film is about boredom and, as such, sometimes the actual story itself tends to become a little dreary itself leaving the film a collection of great bits rather than a thoroughly brilliant whole. ***"

","Jarhead is a good movie that you should see. Although it has the same structure of war movies (training, war, conclusions), it isn't a war movie: you won't see spectacular battles and bloody tracks. On the contrary: all the situations that in a war movie would be filmed with a furious action scene, in JH are depicted with a strong slow down of tension and rhythm, as they happened out of time.The thoughts of Swofford (the protagonist) -filled of a bitter and grotesque humor- are really fantastic and analyze what's happening from a fascinating point of view, that makes laugh also in dramatic moments. The one bad aspect of the movie: not all the good promises of the first part are totally developed, and the central part sometimes seems only a patchwork of sequences. For these reasons it is worth a full 7. Nothing more. (sorry for the bad English)"

","This film is about a marine's life in the desert during the Gulf war.<br/><br/>This is not a war film. In fact, war doesn't happen until almost the end. You may be complaining about the lack of action, but so are the characters. This film is more about the lack of direction and frustration of life in the desert.<br/><br/>Acting is great. Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx are both very good. The cinematography is excellent. Near the end, when they walked in the fire lit desert, it reminds me a little of The Chronicles of Riddick.<br/><br/>There are two minor problems with the movie though. One of which is that the background music is far too loud. I have to turn the volume to one third of the previous level when there is music playing. Being loud does not mean being impressive. Hollywood filmmakers will have to learn this. The other problem is that Asian Americans are noticeable absent in this film, while all the other ethnic groups are. I wonder why."

","I'd heard mixed things about Harhead. Someone I knew had seen it, and they really liked it. I'd also heard that there was lots of useless sex in it that detracted from the story. Reviews from critics were mixed too, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I almost didn't go, but then I decided to what the heck, I'll check it out, and see what all the fuss was about.<br/><br/>After thinking about it I'm gonna give this movie a 7/10. It was not your typical war movie at all. The entire movie was basically about how a certain marine, Jake Gyllenhall, had to wait almost half a year for action to start for him and his platoon in the Gulf War. He trained to be a sniper during that whole time, and he finally gets his chance to get in combat, about an hour and a half into the movie.<br/><br/>I won't say anything else, lest the movie is spoiled for you, but it's just about a marine's life, basically, with a particular emphasis on how they're waiting for the action of the Gulf War to start. Though it could be called a war movie, there are less than twenty minutes of combat in a two hour movie. Character development is extremely well done, and we see deep into the lives of these soldiers quite effectively.<br/><br/>The reason I docked off 3 points was because of several things. One was the useless, kind of extraneous sex. Though it was a definite part of the storyline, they could have done without showing a lot. At one point I felt like I was watching pornography, and that's never a good thing, even if it does contribute to the storyline. The ending was also a little off, but I personally liked it.<br/><br/>So, if you're curious to see what all the fuss is about, go see Jarhead. However, it's not the kind of movie you need to rush out and see. You can definitely wait until it hits DVD."
"cheap_as_chipios","8","0","1","21 May 2006"," an unfulfilled classic
","i saw this last night and i'd heard mixed opinions of it which seems the problem. The moment Jarhead was announced Sam Mendes the man responsible for American Beauty, a perfectly sculpted comment on lost innocence and alienation takes on war the heart of lost innocence and not only that the gulf war, the ultimate metaphor of alienation and something somewhat feared by Hollywood, not only that but Jake Ghylenhaal, Hollywoods newest wonder boy and star of everybody's favourite cult film was to star. It was touted as the apocalypse now or Full Metal Jacket for the new generation. Apocalypse now it isn't but it could have been. There are countless scenes which could have become iconic, playing American Football in chemical suits and the branding of Troy. Don't mistake me these are still memorable scenes but they are not classic making scenes like the beach attack in Apocalypse now, i also felt Jarhead lacked a character as memorable as Killgore or Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. The film seems very much to be cut up into two halves Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm- the first half (in which Swafford is trained and very suddenly sent to operation desert shield) is well done with ironic music and top one liners (alot of ironic humour, lines such as ""thank god we never have to see to this sh*t hole again"" referring to Iraq) punctuating a general feeling of honesty as to what actually happens in the army. When they hit the desert for operation desert shield i don't believe Mendes has achieved the effect he hoped for, we should feel like we're waiting for something to happen, we should fell like Swaff and the others. The football game should have appeared out of this, just something to do, not playing up for the cameras then it would have been iconic especially if filmed like any given Sunday or Friday night lights. When Swaff loses it with the other soldier was great and perfectly acted by Gylenhaal. When Desert storm begins is when i think the film really takes off you begin to feel really frustrated as they chase the war and the scenes at the burnt out barricade type thing are harrowing, they really make a point as does the friendly fire incident. You really start to feel for Swaf and Troy as they miss the chance at a kill and seeing them go back to their everyday lives makes it's point nicely. The cinematography is stunning there's little more i can say for it, you just have to see the desert after it rains oil. Overall this is a great film but not a classic, it lacks the memorable scenes which make it's predecessors so iconic except the point when the soldiers watch apocalypse now. If it ha been handle with a slightly higher level of skill it would easily have lived up to it's name."

","The movie is about life in the marines before and during the first Gulf War. Jarhead is supposed to be a ""true story"" and is based on a bestseller written by Anthony Swofford about his experiences in the Marines. Both the book and the film didn't met my expectations, perhaps because the portrait of the Marines did not seem plausible.<br/><br/>Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal)is a brooding presence and someone with intellectual pretensions. He reads Camus while sitting on the toilet. Camus explored the practical consequences of existentialist philosophy and described the inherent absurdity of human life. He concluded that the meaninglessness of life can only be mitigated by moral integrity and social solidarity. Perhaps the Camus reference indicates that this is meant to be an existential war movie? Who knows? <br/><br/>The U.S. Marine Corps is depicted as a somewhat dysfunctional organization despite its reputation as one of the world's elite fighting units. The marines are shown as young, fit, apolitical, excitable, immature and trigger happy. They indulge in humiliating induction rituals and carry out pranks on each other. They also like to fight and talk about sex. Anyone of a nervous disposition should avoid signing up. The officers seem like over-grown children. The antics of the troops seem far-fetched. I know a Marine who has served in Iraq, who told me the portrait is totally inaccurate. There is little resemblance to the stoic, hard-nosed men depicted in the John Wayne WW II movie ""Sands of Iwo Jima."" Mendes' Marines are fragile and almost on the verge of a mental breakdown. <br/><br/>The war is over before our marines fire a shot in anger, but they return as conquering heroes. The film doesn't seem to have have an overt political message. Essentially there is no plot, and no denouement. Mendes is a skilled director and the acting is excellent. Although Jarhead is lively and the exploits of the marines are mostly entertaining, it's disappointing as entertainment."

","In my opinion Jarhead has revolutionized what we used to know as the ""war movie"" genre. Combining elements of comedy and true drama, this movie introduces its audience to what it really is to be a marine and part of a war. This movie presents very serious issues to its audience, yet it does not fail to entertain us by including elements of suspense, excitement, and bawdy, yet hilarious comedy.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Anthony Sworfford, this movie brings to us the story of a young marine who ended up in the corps on his way to college. The story follows this marine's (Gyllehaal) life through his first years in the corp, the Gulf War, and ultimately his return home.<br/><br/>The outstanding performances by Jake Gyllenhaal, Jamie Foxx, Peter Sarsgaard, and the rest of the cast, bring a whole new perspective to the issue of war and the lives of young marines. This movie makes its audience experience moments of grief, laughter, suspense, and more; ultimately creating a great experience for its viewers. The major flaw of the movie is probably the questions it leaves unanswered at the end, like what did Swofford ended up doing? (even though we know he ended up becoming a writer and selling his novel to make this movie...) How did Troy die? and a few more.<br/><br/>Overall I give this movie an 8.5/10, being a very well-made movie with astonishing shots, and terrific performances.<br/><br/>Jarhead is a ""must-see!"""

","Subtle is Sam Mendes style, well paced but with amazing visuals is what we've come to expect from the director of 'American beauty'. Jarhead is no exception and from the opening gambit of Jake being put through his paces by the drill sergeant from hell right up to the closing shots this movie has all the elements of a classic. This is a war film but with no war in it and the voice over of the central character sounds like a teenagers diary extract which in a way it is. Twenty-year-old Swoff, as he says in his own words 'got lost on my way to college' and is gearing up to go to Iraq during the first gulf war. From here on in the story is all about the lack of war, the futility of it all and the boredom of the troops. The whole thing is visually stunning and contains some of the most impressive cinematography i've ever seen. Being set in the desert Mendes can sweep and languish on expansive landscapes complete with sunsets, sandstorms and burning oil wells. Its not all gloom as is often the case in these situations there is a lot of humour even if at times it is dark. Obviously there is a message within the films exploration of war and human nature and sometimes this feels a little much. We all know war is bad, get over it. Apart from that and maybe being about twenty minutes too long there is nothing I can fault this film for it is well scripted, acted and executed. I will be surprised if this film doesn't win the awards it so rightly deserves."

","This film is ""Waiting for Godot"" goes to war. Godot is the pink mist. Can't live with it, can't live without it-- but in the end, whether you fired a shot in anger or not, you must. Thinking man's story-- Mendes has made a courageous film, as usual he doesn't give a sh** what the audience thinks or wants, and I applaud that. Jake G is great in this film, contrast this performance with Twist in Brokeback...and remind yourself it is the same guy; great things to come from this young actor. This is a very good film. Peter Sarsgaard is underrated, this guy is so solid in every role that you forget he's there--a credit to his craft. Nice kickoff with the raging DI too- hearkens back to Jack Webb in 'The DI' and of course the great Emrey in Full Metal-- feels like you get fired from a gun out of the barracks. Subtle message in an awesome landscape...you gotta love Mendes."

","I've watched all of Mendes' films so far (not to mention a stage adaptation of Chekov's ""Uncle Vanya"" directed by him and co-starring Emily Watson during my week-and-a-half stay in London in 2002) but every new effort seems to me to be a lesser achievement than the previous one! Anyway, while the film is essentially  and typically  well-made (particularly the editing, propelled by an eclectic soundtrack), it's also unoriginal since it basically rips off FULL METAL JACKET (1987)  but is inferior to it in every way (with the second half, as described further down in my comments, being even more of a let-down than that film's!)  as well as having elements from both SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998) and particularly BLACK HAWK DOWN (2001) thrown in for good measure! <br/><br/>Despite good performances by the established actors (Gyllenhaal, Sarsgaard, Foxx and Cooper) and the fact that the film is based on true events, the characters are total stereotypes (with the sex-obsessed camaraderie being especially alienating)though the recruits' frustration/jealousy over their respective partners back home, albeit over-emphasized, is perhaps the film's sole novelty! Besides, it's disappointing that the soldiers see no real action during their stay in the war zone  and neither is the intriguing suggestion that a war veteran remains inclined towards violence and never truly readjusts to civilian life developed in any waywhich, ultimately, renders the whole thing somewhat pointless!"

","A war film should be about the fighting. Why make it otherwise? Make something else. This one was all about the sidebars of war, not war action thus it left me wanting much more of the war action part and not what this film was about, which looked like all the director's outtakes put together. I could not get used to seeing our soldiers well prepared for battle and then not fighting the war they were trained to fight, instead fighting their own personal demons and new-age introspective ""issues"". How PC and touchy-feely the war ""situation"" was in this film...no fighting, just personal ""issues""! <br/><br/>The soldiers' personal life ""issues"", and their waiting around, bickering, waiting around, intimidating, waiting around, digging foxholes in the sand, waiting around, heat and dust suffering, waiting around, walking around, etc. and other mostly boring in-between-the-actual-fighting filler material should lead to a great action payoff in any good war story, but this film did not pay off at all as it lead nowhere and ended nowhere near a good war action story(I was in the Army so I know a lot of being a soldier is waiting around, standing around, sitting around, marching around....all the time waiting for the big payoff to make up for the other very boring crap that the filmmaker thought was so important to show us for 2 effing hours.....but not to me!).<br/><br/>So, in the future, if I ever get the urge to see another ""war"" film about all the ""issues"" stuff that goes on while the soldiers are not actually fighting, I'll beat myself over the head until the urge goes away and save myself 2 wasted hours. Or, see a great war movie like Saving Private Ryan for the 10th time!"

I really hope this film becomes a cult classic that people will watch for a long time, it would be a shame if this film got written off the popular culture radar.

","Amidst a nation still embedded in several military battles across the globe, this film might seem a little inappropriate at first glance. A film without any true heroes, or even heavy classic battle sequences like recent military film ""Black hawk down"". No true champions for which align. What it does offer, is something only touched upon in military films, the fragile mental state of men whose lives are constantly under pressure.<br/><br/>The film is based on a autobiographical memoir of a marine, during the original operation desert storm/shield conflict in Kuwait. Jake Gyllenhaal ( Brokeback Mountain ) plays Swofford, the excited and trouble making young soldier. Peter Saarsgard ( Flightplan) and Jamie Foxx ( Ray) play his closest friend and his commanding officer, respectively. The characters must cope with their lives constantly on the brink of danger, but never crossing that boundary. So what happens when you prepare young men for a war...that never happens.<br/><br/>The movie is shot wonderfully. the deserts are vast, dry and hot, the night sky pitch black with a red sand. The look of the film is amazing. The acting is also impressive. However, as an audience we are often left much like the soldiers, unsure of where to go or what to do next. I understand this is one soldiers perspective, so i should not have expected much, but it never really tied anything together. At the end, it just seems too ambiguous and left me unsure of what take away. war is bad..but is it worse if the promise of war is never fulfilled???Only the original Swofford might know the answer."

","I, going to a school where war is the choice career, was hysterical when every child went to see Jarhead, hoping for the next Saving Private Ryan. But instead, got an anti-war movie, with no action sequences. They all said it was the worst war movie they've ever seen. Obviously, from one of the first lines in the movie, this is NOT a war flick. Do not expect a bloody, bumpy-camera, fogged-lens, modern version of Hamburger Hill. Do not expect Full Metal Jacket with M16's. Do not expect Black Hawk Down: Iraqi Takedown. Instead, expect a moving, flawless, touching, masterful epic of a marines struggle through Gulf War, and how it changed him. There is tension, there is fighting. Threats of weapon discharges, helpless soldiers wandering through inches of oil, burning gas fields, work, boredom, faulty NBC suits, untrusting wives, and nighthmares. Jarhead gives you the experience of what these marines went through, without having to wait in the desert for 6 months, wanting only to fire your rifle at something other than dirt. Peter Sarsgaard, who plays Troy, is deserving of an Oscar. His every line is perfectly spoken, filled with wit and character. I actually cried when he flips over not getting his only chance at a KO. And trust me, I don't cry during movies much. Last time was during My Dog Skip. So, how does it end? Do they go home? Yes. Are they hurt? Yes. Are there lives changed forever? Not all of them. Will they ever go back? Only one. Do they get to kill someone? No, not even one. Do they have fun? Sometimes. Are they still walking through the desert?

"iplaygames2","6","0","1","11 April 2006"," A war movie...without the war?
","Jarhead is a 'behind the scenes' war movie, if ever there was one. We follow the military career of Swofford, who progresses through boot camp and scout/sniper school and eventually winds up in Iraq serving in Desert Shield.<br/><br/>If you're looking for action packed scenes and lots of special effects, then you may want to pass on this film. This is more about the life of a soldier in the Corps than actual firefights and explosions. There are relatively few battle scenes in the film, and it spends more time in the barracks and in camp than on patrol. Not necessarily a bad thing, mind you, but it may not be what some people expect when they see this movie.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the look at life behind the front lines perspective in the film. Watching this without reading anything about it, I didn't know what to expect. Honestly, I was hoping for more action; it is based on the Gulf War and everything I remembered seeing (trailers, etc) showed a platoon on patrol in the war zone. That's not the way the movie played out, at all.<br/><br/>It's 123 minutes long, a bit stretched out, in my opinion. There are parts of the movie that drag on longer than they need to. All in all, though, it's a movie worth watching. Just don't go into it expecting a shoot-em-up thriller, and you won't be disappointed."
"EUyeshima","7","0","1","9 April 2006"," Gulf War Frustrations Vividly Captured Even Though Characters Remain Distant
","Some films work more effectively on a visceral level than a logical one, and this 2005 film adaptation of U.S. Marine Anthony Swofford's 2003 biting memoir is one of them. Chronicling the author's time from boot camp through the brief 1991 Gulf War, director Sam Mendes fills his sometimes blackly comic film with brutalizing images that give it a consistently propulsive urgency. Written by William Broyles Jr. (who had wartime duty in Vietnam as a pilot), it is not really a combat film as the focus of the story is the incessant waiting that the ground troops endured before realizing the conflict was over almost as soon as it began. Mendes and Broyles have us look at the preparation for the ground war within an episodic structure that keeps everything at arm's length emotionally. Moreover, they borrow liberally from previous military-themed films  not only obvious references to scenes from Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" and Brian DePalma's ""Casualties of War"" but also paeans to the group dynamics in WWII-era movies with each of the Marines representing familiar wartime archetypes.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the fresh-faced Swofford and does an admirable job here as he outwardly expresses his enthusiasm, especially when he gets chosen to be a surveillance sniper, but inwardly has gnawing misgivings about his tour of duty. His becalmed voice-over is what ties the loose connective tissue of the story, as well as the constant punishment Swofford receives from his superiors, including a humiliating demotion from lance corporal to private for covering an act of false bravado by a fellow recruit. Peter Sarsgaard plays Swofford's scouting partner Troy in his trademark elliptical manner given that his character's motivations remain suspect until revelations come to light toward the end. Due to the nature of the film, other characters are not as fully realized, including Jamie Foxx doing commendable work in a relatively small role as the unyielding Staff Sgt. Sykes (his one personal scene when he discusses his life at home seems shoehorned in), Dennis Haysbert in a couple of scenes as the arrogant Major Lincoln, Chris Cooper effectively Schwartzkopf-like as Lt Colonel Kazinski, and the young actors portraying Swofford's fellow recruits. It took me a while to recognize Lucas Black, who plays the horny redneck Kruger, as the young boy in Billy Bob Thornton's ""Sling Blade"".<br/><br/>Performances aside, the standout work is Roger Deakins' cinematography, which captures the surreal atmosphere of the deserts with the mirage-inducing heat during the day and the burning oil wells at night. There are few scenes more painfully evocative of the war than the one where the Marines come upon the charred remains of locals frozen as if caught in an A-bomb attack. The overall realism of the movie is what makes this noteworthy, and to the filmmakers' credit, it has no political agenda beyond showing the agonies of serving in prospect of a war. The soundtrack has period-appropriate music that runs the gamut from Nirvana to Naughty by Nature to C+C Music Factory. The obvious comparison the film engenders is with David O. Russell's 1999 ""Three Kings"", which shares the same setting and a similar orientation toward black comedy, though I have to say that Russell's film is more inventive. Still, Mendes is an individualistic director whose work is always worth experiencing.<br/><br/>The DVD has several solid extras, including two separate commentary tracks. Interestingly, the one with Swofford and Broyles, both familiar with military service firsthand, is more informative than the one provided by Mendes, who focuses more on the themes and his inspirations. There are a handful of deleted scenes which were understandably excised, including one with Sam Rockwell playing Swofford's gung-ho military uncle talking to the camera (actually to Swofford in a flashback), a seeming rip-off of a Christopher Walken's scene in ""Pulp Fiction"". There is another set of scenes under the umbrella of Swofford's fantasies, also deleted, but intriguing for the black comedy aspect that they seemed to serve. Also included is a longer version of the interview sequence where the media volleys questions to the recruits in documentary style. Veteran film editor Walter Murch adds his commentary to Mendes' on all the deleted scenes."

"DroneNYC","8","0","1","7 April 2006"," Huge military inaccuracies in ""Jarhead""
","Good film, but some impossibilities exist in it:<br/><br/>1) At the beginning of the film, during training, Staff Sgt. Sykes accidentally kills one of his men in a live-fire drill as he fires a machine gun over their heads. Sykes is not investigated or reprimanded at all. In fact he goes on to lead a squad of men into battle. In real life Sykes would have most likely be relieved of his command, or at least demoted. Not to mention that Drill Sergeants that train Marines in boot camp would need to apply for transfer out of that duty to go into combat duty. The film makes it seem this type of transfer is commonly granted and even status quo; that the Marines have no need or interest in retaining Drill Sergeants for further basic combat training purposes. And if a Drill Sergeant did seek and was granted combat reassignment (which almost never happens) that Sergeant would probably never be assigned a squad that they had personally trained. NOT TO MENTION, machine guns are never fired with live rounds at recruits in basic training. Maybe in the BUDS training of Navy Seals, maybe. ALSO, Sykes constantly shouts profanities at his recruits in boot camp, which is officially banned nowadays, but wasn't always, but certainly was from at least 1989 forward.<br/><br/>2) Quite often it seems that the squad of men depicted in the film are the only troops around. They never seem to be part of a larger unit, like say a platoon or company. And Sykes doesn't seem to answer to a superior officer like a Lieutenant or Captain. The squad always seems to be secluded by themselves. We watch them carry on as the camera moves around them, and we never see any other troops or military hardware in the background, except in one or two short scenes. (No wonder they catch some friendly fire from some A-10s!) Meanwhile, all throughout the film, we are shown subtitles that count up the level of troops in the region, culminating at 500,000. I doubt that more than 50 troops were ever shown in any one scene in the film.<br/><br/>3) Marines are shown playing football in full anti-chemical suits in 112-degree weather. Most all the men would have collapsed and perhaps died because it is so hard to breath in gas masks, and full anti-chemical suits don't exactly ""breath"" either. They ain't made out of linen! Yet all we see is one Marine fall to his knees, which is played out as a comic moment.<br/><br/>4) When Swofford and Troy are in place to snipe at an enemy commander, Major Lincoln orders them to stand down, as he decides to call in an air strike instead. Troy, in frustration for being ordered to stand down, attacks and fights with Major Lincoln. Troy is not reprimanded or punished for this insubordination. Some form of reprimand would most certainly occurred in real life. I mean, Lincoln barely even yells at Troy!<br/><br/>5) After the scene described above, Swofford and Troy become separated from their squad. No one from their squad tries to locate them. Swofford and Troy are left to find their own way back to their squad, as if given up for dead. This would never happen in the real Marines.<br/><br/>6) At the end of the film, when Swofford and Troy do find their own way back to their squad, they find out that the war is over. Swofford complains that he never got to fire his rifle. Troy suggests he does so now. Swofford fires a round into the air. Other members of the squad follow suit and expend entire magazines of ammo into the air, with rifles set to full automatic fire (which most M-16's don't do, but rather fire in 3-round bursts instead). Random and pointless discharging of small arms in a non-combat setting is distinctly prohibited in all branches of the armed forces. Then they start burning their battle dress uniforms in a huge bonfire. No Sergeant would allow such anarchic and blatantly dangerous behavior, especially a former Drill Sergeant!!! Sykes does though, I guess since he doesn't seem to ever have a Lieutenant around to answer to. PLUS, they would still need their clothes and ammo since they were still in the middle of nowhere in the desert at night. Duh!<br/><br/>7) After the scene described above, it seems the troops go home the very next day! Impossible.<br/><br/>Okay, so not every scene needs to be perfect and by the book military-wise, as things do go awry in the fog of war. But this film is so not by the book you have to wonder if the filmmakers even knew the book existed!!!"

"soldaten116","7","0","1","31 March 2006"," A movie review and an an apology
","I was wrong - Wrong about the movie and wrong about the book. Swofford is a whiny malcontent, he may even be a coward, but he was 100% right on. I don't agree with his conduct and some of the things he did or said. I let my personal feelings about the man get in the way of the truth and the truth is this movie is about as accurate as anything I have ever seen about the modern Marine Corps. Do I like how it was portrayed? No. Is it an accurate portrayal? Yes. The movie and the book contain embellishments. Between Swofford and Hollywood, the movie wasn't how I remembered it. The details had been changed, sometimes dramatically and I got wrapped up in that instead of concentrating on what the movie/book were trying to say. It's not so good watch a movie about your life knowing the details have been changed to help the story along or the movie producers' life easy. I have a personal stake in this movie and in the Gulf War and I forget to be objective and intellectually honest with myself.<br/><br/>I am also a 2/7, GW veteran. When I saw the book in the store I couldn't believe it. So I bought it, read it and then threw it away because I misunderstood it. I didn't see it for what it was  the truth, and if there's one thing we all know  the truth hurts. War is a destructive and corrosive event and no matter what happens, you will be affected by it for the rest of your life. Lack of action or not, no man or woman can come out of it the same as they went in it. A good war movie doesn't have to be about death and destruction; it just has to show what war does to human beings. Swofford had put the essence of that into his book and his movie. Both are masterpieces and you are a gifted writer. Thanks you for making me confront my own demons about the Marines and the GW. For the first time, I have put those events into perspective in my life.<br/><br/>You and I would not have gotten along in the USMC. That's fine as we both know there are a lot of Marines we both didn't like. You probably would not have liked me either. I was a smart ass college drop out seeking some sort of reckoning with my plush suburban life. The USMC slapped the heck(stronger word originally inserted) out of me and made me a man. I owe my entire existence and success in life to what I learned in the USMC. You are convinced that the USMC destroys more than it builds. I think the USMC forces people to grow up and be who they were meant to be. Criminals realize they are criminals. The insane were always there, the USMC just brings it out. I don't think the USMC makes either. I believe you think the USMC does. We differ on a fundamental level. So be it.<br/><br/>I'm sorry about throwing away your book. I'll go out and buy another copy and the movie too. They'll both go on their respective shelves where they belong. I gave this movie a 1 when I first saw it. Sorry Swoff, I was wrong to do that. I changed it to an 8 because, now admit it, you took a few liberties here and there. And what was with the silly shooting scene at the end of the movie?? Did they pay you extra to let that in?"
"petertagliabue","10","0","1","26 March 2006"," ""All wars are different,...
","...all wars are the same."" This line, spoken during the final minutes of the movie, really sums up the whole viewing experience.<br/><br/>The story evolves around a young man who enters the U.S. marine corps, takes part in the training, is sent to Kuwait after the Iraqi invasion 1990, and returns after the conclusion of Desert Storm. In between, he sees burning oil fields, the remains of an Iraqi family burnt to a crisp by shell fire or air-raid bombs, his friends - and he himself - losing all aspects of civilized behavior during their stay in the desert of Saudi Arabia... all in all, the usual insanity of any war.<br/><br/>And that is the amazing feat this movie achieves: it takes the whole war down to a personal level and concentrates on the members of this small unit. And it concentrates on their behavior and reaction during a time of stress, and of mortal danger: the machismo; the growing frustration with not being able to kill and fight, despite all the preparation; and the anger about developments at home - the unfaithful girlfriend/spouse etc.<br/><br/>All these frustrations mount, but they are never able to erupt; in one scene, 2 marines are told NOT to kill an enemy officer in their sights as it is a job for an air force strike. Everything they've done and been through has, for them, built up to this ONE kill, which they are now denied... and it is this, the fact that ordinary people are reduced to killers, craving this one kill that will make the whole ordeal worthwhile, that the movie brings to the viewer's attention. And it is an achievement that singles it out, and, in my opinion, puts it right up there with, to name one, ""All quiet on the western front"".<br/><br/>Which, by the way, I urge you to see back to back with this one.

It truly seemed impossible because of the way the book was written. It really just didn't seem like it would work at all. Anthoney Swofford is a very touching ""character"" and of course a very real one. The plot is great. Many things have been changed from the book but they still work very well, surprisingly well. The acting is very good all around. Jake Gyllenhaal is very, very good but he is better in Brokeback Mountain. Jamie Foxx is even better than Gyllenhaal giving one of his best performances to date. Chris Cooper is also very good in an almost cameo performance. Peter Sarsgaard is though the standout performance. He is amazing and may even top his brilliant performance in Garden State. He is a brilliant Troy. Sam Mendes is one of the best directors working today. He deserved Oscars for both American Beauty and Road to Perdition and he is just as good here. Even if Jarhead came out in a stronger year so he doesn't do the best direction of the year, but he is of course very close. The cinematography is amazing and maybe the best of the year. The art direction, costume design and such are also amazing. A surprisingly brilliant war film that is one of the must see films of the year."

"gradyharp","6","0","1","8 March 2006"," Significance? JARHEAD depicts the Bizarre DESERT STORM War
","Were intentions graded instead of product, then JARHEAD would be given 4 stars rather than 3, merely because it is one of the few films (so far) that shows the particular idiosyncrasies of that first Bush war, the DESERT SHIELD transforming into DESERT STORM. We have many films that document the mindset of the soldiers from the Civil War through the two World Wars, to Korean War to Vietnam War and each is different. JARHEAD is as much about the changes that have occurred in the American military with the advent of computerized warfare and sophisticated war machines and weapons as it is about the Greed for Oil Dominance that prompted the US Kuwaiti involvement. And for that this film is important and will remain so until something better comes along.<br/><br/>The story is rather minimal and as narrated by the author of the novel on which it is based, Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal), it takes a while to become airborne. Swoff is a disillusioned kid who can't figure out how to make life meaningful so he opts for the USMC as a staging zone in his growth. What he discovers is the usual boot camp mentality and training, encountering other men who have both similar and different reasons for joining the Corps: Troy (Peter Saarsgard) has dark issues that remain with him throughout the story; Kruger (Lucas Black) opted for the Corps instead of prison; Cortez (Jacob Vargas) needed money to support his pregnant wife; Cuban immigrant Escobar (Laz Alonso) sincerely is a grateful patriot, etc. Along the way the boys encounter the stereotype DI (Scott MacDonald), the Staff Sergeant (Jamie Fox) and the company commander Lt Col Kazinski (Chris Cooper) as well as the usual variety of testosterone provoked young kids successfully brainwashed to be 'fighting men'.<br/><br/>The bulk of the story after boot camp is the boredom of going to war in the Kuwaiti desert, having nothing at all to do except play dumb games and wait and hydrate, until at last the Staff Sergeant gleefully announces Saddam Hussein is shooting and they are off to actually do what they were trained to do - Fight! But even that is thwarted as they wade through a miserable existence of seeing sky-darkened oil well fires, constant oil raining from the burning oil money holes, losing buddies to friendly fire and mistaken attacks by their own air support. And just at the point when this company of trained snipers (especially Swoff and Troy) gets the chance to kill, the 'war' is over and they go home. And in Swofford's narrative comments he notes how those men will never be allowed to leave the desert experience behind. 'Wars are different, yet wars are the same'.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal, buffed and shaved headed, gives us everything Swoff represents - as far as the meager script and misguided direction by Sam Mendes allow. He is a fine actor and his range of emotions is what holds the film together. The remainder of the cast likewise does their best to make their shadowy character outlines from the screenplay by William Broyles Jr. as close to three-dimensional as the lines allow. Yes, the film is about a new kind of soldier, one less driven by patriotism and more informed about the commercial greed that drives these fiascoes, and Mendes does allow us to see that. But deeper character development and motivation could have made this a more powerful antiwar statement than a visual excursion of life under the sun of the foreign desert skies. Grady Harp"

","I have recently seen Jarhead and it is visually very well done. It lacks character development until to late into the movie. Since this seems to be an attempt at Appoc Now redo. They could have done this up in the movie's onset. Even the character narration is right out of the classic Appoc Now. I was waiting for a tiger to come out of the dessert. It was good but it's focus on the theme of the personal battle of the character was a bit boring. It does portray the reality of war but not worth the movie's not worth dying for.

","jarhead is not a movie about politics nor should it be. it is an adaptation of a superbly written journal which follows the life of a soldier who doesn't really know what he is in for when he enrolls. there is far too much criticism about how Mendes should have pushed the envelope a little bit more, but its a story with more of an anti-war aspect to it, than an anti-Bush aspect. if anyone remembers back to good ol' Deer Hunter, you will see many resemblances. it showed people the horrific percussions of war, rather than the issue of whether they should have actually been there or not. the movie reveals ""what"" it was like in Iraq during the early '90s, not how it ""should"" have been. <br/><br/>and as if you couldn't love the movie for its acting and cinematography alone; mesmoerizing in the way Schindler's was."
"Doylenf","7","0","1","7 March 2006"," Gritty, realistic, tough first-hand account of U.S. Marines in Gulf War...
","JAKE GYLLENHAAL contributes to the impression gained from other films that he's one of the hottest contenders for the cream of the crop of new actors on the Hollywood scene. His performance here is flawless and just plain brilliant.<br/><br/>The novel was written by a man who served his time in the Gulf War and we see the story from his viewpoint as a U.S. Marine training for combat under arduous conditions in Iraq after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. The desert landscape looks as though it was filmed on actual locations instead of Mexico.<br/><br/>The salty language is peppered with typical service jargon (plenty of vulgarity and ""f"" words tossed around), the kind that was never allowed in service films from the '30s to the '50s--which makes the whole thing ring true with even more authenticity than usual. Anyone easily offended will have to skip this one.<br/><br/>While Gyllenhaal carries much of the film, CHRIS COOPER impresses in a brief role as a Lt. Col. and JAMIE FOXX is superb as a crusty Staff Sgt. whose only goal is to get his men into fighting shape. All of the supporting actors do amazingly well in roles that steer away from being the kind of stereotypes we're used to in service films. There's a wild unpredictability in the antics of the young men that comes from a superior script and enhanced by expert direction from Sam Mendes. Gyllenhaal is exceptional in his freaked out moment where he almost contemplates committing friendly fire on a buddy who lets the troop down. His temperamental and hysterical outburst is utterly convincing.<br/><br/>The oil well scenes are strikingly photographed for maximum effect and there's a jauntiness to the background score that fits the wild antics of a bunch of boy/men who make up these fighting and playful Marines.<br/><br/>Not a treatise on the Gulf War or the U.S. involvement in it, but simply a straightforward tale of what it was like for Anthony Swofford who wrote the novel based on his own real-life experiences. <br/><br/>Highly recommended as an interesting look at men in stress under dangerous but sometimes boring combat conditions where some troops never even got to fire a gun."

"dee.reid","9","0","1","7 March 2006"," A soldier's story redefined
","""Jarhead"" is a war film unlike any other before it because the story concentrates on the personal narrative and experiences of a single bored soldier and his companions in the United States Marine Corps. Its narrator, Marine Corps sniper Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal), is the kind of American kid from a military background who convinces news reporters in an interview that he signed up out of idealism, has strong faith in his country's leaders, but at the end he quips that he signed up because ""he was dumb enough to sign a contract.""<br/><br/>""Jarhead"" is more distinct from other films before it because there is little action, little heroics, and lots of swearing and standing around because they have nothing better to do. At one point late in the film, Swofford and a comrade have set up a sniper post, get orders to take a shot and just when he's about to pull the trigger, a fellow marine shows up and warns them to step down for fear the shot may give away an incoming air strike. Swoff's comrade begs for one shot because their hellish training and wasted days doing nothing has led up to this one point in time for glory, but ultimately comes no big reward or payoff.<br/><br/>The film opens as Swofford has just entered basic training and offhandedly assumes he has made a mistake by enlisting. He's immediately signed on to a unit of rough-housers, screw-ups, and retards (and for some reason the man who assigned him to this unit didn't lead us on to believe he was kidding). Based on his own 2003 best-selling memoir of the same title, Swofford's narration ranges from scathing indictment of his situation to a seething resentment of it; he does provide some comedy, though it doesn't come easy for the most part (even though there is one funny part when a tent gets burned down, which has to be seen to be understood). He counts the days, cleans his rifle, debates past sexual conquests, thinks of masturbating (a lot), and worries about his girlfriend - who may be cheating on him.<br/><br/>The men in his unit are some of the saddest sacks to ever join the Marine Corps. Under the command of Staff Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Foxx), he trains them hard for battle. Sykes loves his job, loves the Corps, loves training the men, and can't wait for the moment of combat for his men to shine. And soon enough, they're shipped off to Saudi Arabia a.k.a. ""the suck"" as part of the U.S. government's ""Operation Desert Shield"" and their first mission is to guard the oil wells for their friends, the Saudis, from the Iraq president Saddam Hussein and the Republican Guard. This mainly consists of sitting around, braving the soaring desert heat, giving interviews to reporters, throwing around footballs, drinking lots of water, and trying desperately to maintain a sense of sanity.<br/><br/>He does make a friend eventually, his spotter Alan Troy (Peter Sarsgaard), who is the aforementioned comrade who goes nuts during that sniper scene. In their first 170 or so days in Iraq, the men are pumped for action (in a motivational speech by Chris Cooper, no less, in a cameo), swearing constantly (with at least 278 uses of the f-word and its variants), getting drunk, and thinking about girlfriends or wives back home who may be cheating on them (and photos of those unfaithful women are posted on the infamous ""Wall of Shame""). There is no tension, and when they think they're about to be attacked by eight ominous, approaching Iraqis while on patrol in the desert, Swofford goes to investigate and when he returns to report to his comrades, it turns out that ""someone shot three of their camels.""<br/><br/>The term ""jarhead,"" the self-describing moniker of men in uniform, is defined early in the film as the way that a soldier looks in full combat gear, with a head, given greater definition by the crew-cuts, is shaped like a jar. ""Jarhead,"" the film, is a soldier's story told from a young man who knows what's going on but not why. His whole war lasted ""four days, four hours, and one minute"" - that was his war, Anthony Swofford's war. It was four days, four hours, and one minute or so of nothing but sitting around and killing time.<br/><br/>When it came out last year, I remember a storm of controversy swelling up around ""Jarhead"" because Hollywood seems to be riding the wave against ""Iraq, part II,"" though I believe Anthony Swofford and director Sam Mendes have repeatedly insisted the novel and film are apolitical, despite the latter's open contempt for the war and our government, as well as some of the negative war reactions of actors including Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard. And it's true: the film doesn't take sides. But all it does is show the tediousness and boredom of a conflict that to them, never actually was, and leaves it at that.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I rented Jarhead not knowing exactly what to think. I had wanted to see it in theaters but was told not to. I was also told to not pay any attention to the trailer because the trailer for Jarhead makes it seem like an action war movie. THIS IS NOT AN ACTION WAR MOVIE. If you want a war movie with a lot of fighting go get Black Hawk Down! Jarhead focuses on the character of Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) and the psychological turmoil that he goes through during his tour in the Gulf. The film displays exactly what goes on in the minds of the soldiers when the really have nothing to do.<br/><br/>The movie was simply brilliant. Sam Mendes did a phenomenal job with the direction. The shots in the desert and breathtaking and the shots with the burning oil fields are astounding. The acting in the film is also terrific. Peter Sarsgaard does an exceptional job playing Troy. His emotionally portrayal of this characters adds incredible depth to the film. Jamie Foxx (who I normally hate) also did a great job. He was confident in his scenes but also displayed sympathy towards the men in his squad. But the film truly belongs to Gyllenhaal. He is able to demonstrate the incredible change his character underwent throughout the film. There are a number of scenes where Gyllenhaal just explodes and simply takes your breath away. With films like this, Donnie Darko and Brokeback Mountain, Gyllenhaal is showing why he really is one of the best actors of this generation. He will be around for a very long time!! Jarhead is an excellent movie that moved me greatly. GO RENT IT NOW!"

"xredgarnetx","6","0","1","4 March 2006"," Anti-war?
","It's hard to decide whether JARHEAD, ostensibly about the Gulf War, is pro- or anti-war. What it really is about is the day-to-day life of a Marine, and that includes an awful lot of sitting around, waiting for something to do. Hurry up and wait, I believe is what they call it. Like sitting in the doctor's office for an hour, waiting to be examined for three minutes. But these guys never even get their three minutes. Even during the height of Desert Storm war, the Marines in this picture find they have little or nothing to do, as the war always seems to be two steps ahead of them. In this telling, based on the memoirs of ex-Marine Anthony Swofford, it turns out to be an air war, and our boys are stuck on the ground. In the end, the film is really about personalities, and for better or worse we have seen these same personalities in a hundred other war pictures. The best of those flicks has been and remains the first half of FULL METAL JACKET. Watch JARHEAD for Jake Gyllenhall as Swofford, a very different character from DONNIE DARKO, his best known role. Gyllenhall's costar, Jamie Foxx as a platoon sergeant, turns in a pale imitation of Lou Gossett in AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN. Chris ""Twin Peaks"" Cooper has a cameo as a commanding officer, but isn't given anywhere enough screen time to register. Dennis ""24/Allstate"" Haysbert shows up for about 10 seconds as another officer."

","What struck me in the very beginning of the movie was that it looked like an absolute Full Metal Jacket ripoff. It is not such a thing, because as we progress to the end the movie distances itself a lot from that. I do believe that it's interesting because it portrays the state of the US army: a bunch of young, confused kids who know very little about what they're fighting for and who their enemy is, and are enraged against their enemy and driven to hate him, even without knowing him. Trained as to kill for fun, but not used to killing & seeing death, and breaking down nervously really fast. Unexperienced in most aspects of life - including personal - most seemed to have picked girlfriends which dumped them in the first 2 months after they left. Why, then, does the US win wars? Easy, because they don't fight wars, not real ones. They pick on some poorly trained poorly equipped nations and slaughter both themselves and the enemy in the process of war. That's it, a sad story."

","The film looks good. Yes, it's relatively realistic. The only unrealistic scenes are :- The marines getting shot by the A-10's.<br/><br/>As memory serves me (and I was involved in Live Operations so I know what I'm talking about) only The British were shot at and killed by A-10's. Don't bother asking why this happened. About 100 people know and it's so classified it'll never be talked about.<br/><br/>How Swoff isn't shipped out on a section 8 after he tries to kill the guy in their tent, God alone knows.<br/><br/>Also the final scene where Swoff is bitching because he never fired his weapon and then they all started firing wildly into the sky. Even Jamie Foxx who is supposed to be in charge of discipline.<br/><br/>Only a few scenes before Swoff had spoken about what would happen if he shot someone. He'd get done for negligent discharge (known as ND's) and then spend time in the stockade. Well, if the US do the same as the British do, you get billed for every round. About £400 (GB £'s) a round circa 1996.<br/><br/>In that scene Jamie Foxx should be jumping on their skulls and telling them he'll shoot the next man to waste a round. If this was based on a real event I do hope the US military billed them all. This would have cost them thousands.<br/><br/>I can't see the point of letting soldiers about to go to war watch Apocalypse Now. And sending a man in combat a copy of The Deer Hunter. Quite funny when it turns out to be a revenge sex tape from his wife!<br/><br/>Swoff states his war lasted 4 days. Which Gulf war was he in then? The 1st Gulf War (and I was involved, so personally I think he's full of bull) lasted just over 2 weeks.<br/><br/>The ending is weak, no explanation of why his friend died or what Swoff goes on to do next.<br/><br/>Not a bad film but the ending needs work.

","This adaptation from the book by Anthony Swofford, a veteran from the first Gulf War, gives us insight into a world none of us has ever experienced (fortunately). The point of view this British director (known all over the world for ""American Beauty"") proposes is considerably unconventional, comparing this movie to others of this genre. The impact is not so strong, owing to the lack of action and entertainment, but Sam Menders has the intention of showing the political consequences of war actions and doesn't care so much about ""mere action"".

","I love the smell of anti war celluloid in the morning. Today's session had many male ticket-buyers and their friends staring at this excellent new anti war film by master director Sam Mendes. I was particularly impressed by the superb production values, the exact casting and later in the film, the iconic imagery re created largely in eye fooling miniatures and special effects. This is Donnie Darko in Iraq, 1991. I did not recognize Jamie Foxx and Peter Skaarsgard until late in the film...I almost thought I was seeing a Wayan and a Sutherland. Sam Mendes has a superb eye for detail and composition...and why you are seeing something the way he is showing it. To me this identifies a very good director. I believe JARHEAD is a very post modern take on a sad corner of American war like politics, a sign of waste and cruelty for economic reasons and as the scene on the bus at homecoming shows, a hollow victory wrapped in disillusionment and emotional bewilderment. What a great film! It just makes you cheer for the upside of free speech the USA chants (the same free speech that gets abused when crap like DEVILS REJECTS is made).......... JARHEAD is a perfect 2006 film for Dads to take their teenage sons to and have much to discuss and bond about later. More than anything it shows the evil in the detail of Marine life, the reality of the Mom in Farenheit 911 whose son's life was wasted by Bush's recruitment drive through unemployed teens in miserable US cities laid waste by politics and greed."

","It is indeed interesting to read the comment on this movie as having no anti war message. To me it was perfectly clear that the movie is about what happens to young men when they are shoved into an environment of aggression towards an unknown enemy and submission to leadership.The scenes where the boys turn into a group that resembles an evil, uncontrolled organism in itself, for instance the Christmas party scene, were obvious to me as pictures of criticism. But the movie is so wonderfully made, and rather subtle, and so it may be rather difficult for the untrained eye to detect the message.<br/><br/>Actually, that Christmas scene made me feel sick to my stomach. It really put the lowest nature of mankind on display - or should I say manhood?"
"OtoriShigeru","8","0","1","20 February 2006"," A Different Take Was Needed
","Jarhead was one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen all summer. Straying from the usual war movie style of ""Men coming together under fire and being forged into mates hip"", Jarhead analyses the psychologically crippling aspects of warfare and in particular, pre-battle hype. The film is sort of like sex without pay-off with the entire movie featuring little action that the main characters ever see. This does not damage the film's attractiveness but it can become monotonous after a while. In particular, the scene where they are marching towards the Iraqi line (which they don't see) sums up the movie in entirety: frustration. Jake Gyllenhaal shines as Swofford and Peter Sarsgard and Jamie Foxx are also excellent in their own way. Overall, Jarhead was a very well made movie that effectively used sympathy towards the soldier's plight so that the audience became aware of their problems. 8/10"
"flying_kettle","9","0","1","19 February 2006"," A great movie, despite what I got told.

I loved it. I thought that, while there were a few ""what?"" moments, it was overall a decent film, not absolutely choked with the standard ""sex, car chase & pretty women"". I haven't had such a good laugh at the movies for a while. I highly recommend this film. It is visually excellent and filled with the sort of odd humour I enjoy. I have to say that several times i was the only person in the cinema laughing - perhaps that's just the kiwi mindset.<br/><br/>When this film eventually makes it to DVD over here, it will definitely be joining my collection.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","1","16 February 2006"," Every war movie is different, every war movie is the same?
","""Jarhead"" is an unusual war movie, but not without similarities with other war movies. Some of the absurdities remind one of ""Catch 22"". The occasional eerie visual images bring to mind ""Apocalypse now"" although the backdrops are very different, one being the desert, and the other tropical swamps. As to a war movie without any fighting to speak of, the most recent one that I can remember is ""Buffalo soldiers"", which is just as much as a black comedy as a war movie. ""Jarhead"" however, despite all its absurdities, is far too chillingly real to be a black comedy.<br/><br/>It starts out like many other war movies, Anthony ""Swoff"" Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal), having ""got lost on the way to college"", joins the ""jarheads"" (marines, so called because of the shaved heads). The training sequence is handled with the normal mix of comedy and gravity (one guy got killed in a ""real bullets"" training session). The excitement is then pushed to a frantic height with a scene in which the marines are watching the legendary helicopter attack sequence in ""Apocalypse now"", joining the rousing chorus ""Ride of the Valkyries"" from Wagner's ""Die Walkure"". The stage is set for some real action as the marines finally set off to join the Gulf War. Up to this point, we might have been watching ""Dirty Dozen"".<br/><br/>Things then take a sharp turn, as the desert takes over - the desert, but no enemies. Air power has developed to a point where enemies are wiped out long before the group troops gets a chance to encounter any. What the audience now face is the torturous boredom of Swoff and his partner Troy (Peter Sarsgaard)  as snipers work in pairs, a spotter and a shooter. Instead of grand, heroic deeds of war, we see the mundane, pointless existence of these marines in a desert in the middle of nowhere, promised a war that never comes.<br/><br/>The desert itself looms always ominously in the background. In one particular encounter that a few patrolling marines have with a band of camel travellers, the approach of the latter recaptures some of the (but not fully) eerie feelings in Lawrence of Arabia (which I had the good fortune to watch again, the nearly 4 hours of it, on a movie screen) in the first appearance of Omar Sharif.<br/><br/>Nor is the devastating impact of war entirely missing in this movie. It has in fact been handles in a very clever way. In one scene, we see the chilling aftermath of what must have been a ferocious attack, motor vehicles in complete wreck and bodies burnt beyond recognition. We see Swoof wandering about the ruins half-stunned and throwing up. Later in the movie, when the audience sees a swift and deadly air attack at a distance, its mind must inevitably be drawn back to the horrific carnage witnesses earlier. This clever reversal of cause and effect doubles the devastation of the impact.<br/><br/>In the end, it is the loss of individual identity that screams out loud at the audience, as we see Troy begging frantically to be allowed just that one sniper shot before it's all over, when the air attack hits. ""They'll all be dead in a few minutes anyway, so why can't we have that shot"". Unfortunately, the answer form the superior is ""They'll all be dead in a few minutes anyway, so why bother."" There goes Troy and Swoof's last chance to pretend to themselves that they matter in this war. But then, ironically, the jarhead never forgets the Gulf War, just as a Vietnam veteran never forgets the Vietnam War, although for difference reasons. ""We are still in the desert"", says Swoof, haunted by the memories that refuse to go away.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard have both turned in excellent performances. Academy Award winner Jamie Foxx is solid as the staff sergeant, a role that does not offer a great deal of scope. Academy Award winner Chris Cooper has a couple of eye-catching (and ear-catching as well) cameo appearances and the lieutenant colonel.<br/><br/>""Jarhead"" is not for everybody (one person actually walked out in the show I went to) but should please those with the appetite for movies that try to be different."

","Sam Mendes has had a directional career as lustrous as it is selective. He picked one hell of a project to debut with; 1999's critically acclaimed and five-time Oscar-winning ""American Beauty"" was widely regarded as a modern masterpiece and Mendes' direction was highly praised. His follow-up feature, an adaptation of Richard Rayner and Max Collins' graphic novel ""Road to Perdition"", was a very different film, a gangster-oriented exploration of spiritual damnation against the backdrop of the Great Depression, but was nonetheless an impressive, artistic accomplishment. Mendes' third and latest film is another novel adaptation, this time of former Marine Anthony Swofford's autobiographical memoir ""Jarhead"", which details the experiences and psychological effects of operation ""Desert Storm"" on one young soldier during his stay in the Saudi Arabian desert in the early 90's. The film is a further establishment of Mendes' diverse filmography, tied in with his previous works by his supreme visual prowess and inclination to films with profound premise.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal is Marine Anthony Swofford, a disillusioned young man who has turned to the army both to serve his country and to give himself purpose. After a short, awakening stay in Boot Camp, where he confesses after one day that his decision to sign up may ""not have been a good idea"", he is shipped out to Iraq under the watch of Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx) where he is faced with the harsh mercilessness, the reckless frustration and the psychological horror of war. His reality is reflected by the observed behavior of his fellow ""Jarheads"", (Peter Sarsgaard, Jacob Vargas, Lucas Black, Evan Jones), which range from atrocious insensitivity and aggression to supportive encouragement and complacency, and it is in the heat and hell of the desert that Swofford's identity is forged.<br/><br/>Before beginning to consider things like direction, acting and script the most important thing to note about ""Jarhead"" is that, unlike most pictures with controversial content, the film and the characters' values are one and the same: the life of a Jarhead is one of boredom, of aggression, of violence and sometimes of humor, but it knows nothing of politics. This is an examination of war, not 'the Iraq war', as a personal experience and this distinction must be made, preferably before viewing the film.<br/><br/>It is, however, quite an amazing examination of war. The directional presence of Mendes consistently guarantees an artistic and thought provoking visual approach, regardless of the subject matter. This film is brimming with just that; the cinematography is magnificent, particularly the scenes of the burning oil fields, and in this regard ""Jarhead"" outdoes even such divine war-movies as Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"". All other aspects of the film do not quite live up to the promise of the film's overall look, although they work well enough.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal, it appears, is really attempting to break loose from his pigeonholed career. Coupled with his sublime performance in this year's ""Brokeback Mountain"", Gyllenhaal's solid lead in ""Jarhead"" will definitely put him in good stead for outgrowing the shadow of ""Donnie Darko"". Peter Sarsgaard and Jamie Foxx, in their supporting roles, also give stellar performances, and if Foxx had not already won an Oscar, he would be a serious contender for one this year.<br/><br/>As a continuation of Mendes' career, ""Jarhead"" is a logical and commendable step, and only just falls short of the quality of his previous films from a directional point of view. As a stand alone film, it will be visually stimulating, good for a few laughs and an interesting insight into the life of a soldier, but ultimately not the masterpiece that it could well have been."

","It's war, Jim...but not as we know it. At least, not as we know it from Hollywood war movies of past. Except that Jarhead cannot help but draw on predecessors, of which the two that spring to mind while watching it are Apocalypse Now (which gets more than just a namecheck here, in a way which may surprise who thought Coppola's Vietnam epic was universally considered anti-war) and All Quiet On The Western Front. It's about the ennui of war - those yawning moments of boredom between sheer-terror action. But boredom generates its own moments of action, as would expected with a load of hyped-up, testosterone-fuelled young men stuck in the desert with no women, no booze and no idea of what the politicos are doing (and what they're going to do to them). It's beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted with many riveting moments, but it's definitely down-beat rather than gung-ho. Don't go expecting shock-and-awe: this is more Journey's End set in late 20th- century. Best moment: Sarge telling Jake why he's a marine, even though he could be pocketing a cool 100,000 comfortably working back home, and saying something along the lines of ""In what other job could you see something like this?"" And they gaze across the desert nightscape where the oil wells are blazing fiercely into the sky. Reminiscent of Apoc Now's ""I love the smell of napalm in the morning"", but equably memorable nonetheless."
"eddo772003","8","0","1","10 February 2006"," Chris Cooper ,same role?
","Having just seen ""Jarhead"" yesterday I wonder if anyone else thought that actor,Chris Cooper could essentially be playing the same character as he did in ""American Beauty"",and if so was this a deliberate reference on the part of director Sam Mendes. I can't remember the rank of the of the marine played by cooper in the first film but given the timing of the first gulf war it is certainly chronologically possible that this is the same person. Anyway,that little piece of train spotting aside ,I found ""Jarhead"" to be an insightful piece of flaking. Wile some have criticized the film for being pointless in it's narrative,I believe that this was a deliberate and effective device on the part of the director to convey the idealogical void which the soldiers increasingly inhabit. The increasing dissatisfaction of the marines in the desert is a stark counterpoint to the excellent ""Apocolypse now"" sequence earlier in the film."

","Anthony Swofford's life has been a deterrent, with family troubles from every family member. His father is a war veteran and the Marines was a final choice to receive fulfillment. During his training he becomes a sniper, and loves every second of it. Shortly after Swofford is shipped to the gulf war, ready for action. Yet action never arrives and the marines are meet with boredom, with more marines always turning up. Ever distracting themselves with masturbation, constant rehashes of conversation about sex, religion, male order brides, their wall of shame as their wives and girlfriends one by one become unfaithful and always more masturbation. The futility of their constant mind distraction just ever increase their tension, all are constantly ready for action, if and when it arrives.<br/><br/>Jarhead is the name of a marine from the regulation haircut, yet more to that the marines head is an empty vessel. Pitched by the opening, which is undoubtedly comparable to Stanley Kubricks's Full Metal Jacket, where the marines are stripped of their identities to become these empty vessel. Though is isn't the extreme degradation of Full Metal Jacket, with satirical comedy of the marines training and the comradeship between one another. The metamorphose of Jarhead hits in the declaration of war, with the troops sent off to the desert land of death to call home. The tension rises from lack of stimulation and mind games between troops erupt. Many troops more annoyed that they haven't yet fired their gun and received a kill to their name.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes has constructed a tightly tense world where the tension doesn't come from the action, yet the drama between the troops and the unseen enemy. Jarhead doesn't take any real political stance or an anti war point of view, yet shows the psychological view of the mind set of a soldier during war. There is an openness to Jarhead where you make your own conclusion and answers, as we're taken behind the curtain; the marines freedom of speech taken, taking unapproved medicines for gases treatment.<br/><br/>Enhancing Mendes's direction is Roger Deakins's cinematography. The colour pallet is deep, harshly filtered through stark white, capturing the bleakness of their surroundings. The visual effect is haunting in the desert landscape. Swofford and his group walking through the bomb laden highway is so tautly haunting. There is the constant state of an unknown enemy. We never see the enemy yet you feel that they are all around them, constantly watching but never attacking; that mind game state of affairs.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal is stellar as Anthony Swofford. Gyllenhaal is gripping and captures that slow deterioration of sanity over the what seems never ending, action less war. Peter Sarsgaard finally focuses and gives a worthy performance as Troy. Jamie Foxx is great as Staff Sgt. Sykes, keeping a wonderful balance of humanity and leadership is Sykes.<br/><br/>While Jarhead does at times become unfocused, its one tense ride of human emotions during war."
"DICK STEEL","9","0","1","7 February 2006"," A Nutshell Review: Jarhead
","Welcome to the suck. 6 months of waiting for 4 days of ""battle"". Finally a decent yet different war genre movie set during the first Gulf War, which featured what was touted by Saddam as the Mother of All Battles, not. Jarhead is based upon the book by former Marine Anthony Swofford, on his experiences in the Desert Shield and Desert Storm operations.<br/><br/>But we start the journey from the beginning, at the boot camp, and that, to many NS men, will bring back fond memories of the BMT days when nasty drill sergeants rained down vulgarity filled commands, and punishments meted out from whims and fancies. You'll chuckle wholeheartedly, but of course not when you're at the receiving end. The burly platoon mates, the sexual innuendos, the male bonding sessions in the bunks, the various antics, the talk-cock sessions; nostalgic I tell you.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal, who seemed all over the local screens this early 2006 with Proof, Jarhead and the upcoming Brokeback Mountain, plays Swoff, a Marine Scout Sniper whose perspective we see the War from. He's no angel though, as we witness his trials and tribulations in the United States Marine Corps sent to the Middle East. The supporting cast of Peter Sarsaard as his buddy, and Jamie Foxx (in another military role after the disappointing outing in Stealth) help lift the movie with their fine performances.<br/><br/>What appeals in this movie, the strong points, are the numerous elements that are identifiable with Gulf War I - the friendly fire, the air strikes, the looming threat of chemical warfare, the television coverage and interviews with troops you see so very often over CNN, the dubious anti-chemical agent pills, the oil well fires, and the smoking' civilian convoys. They're all there in the narrative, played out as it is.<br/><br/>We also look into the difficulties the men face when stuck out there in a different land, in an indefinite period of waiting - the loneliness, the worry of their loved ones being unfaithful, the rush to wait and the wait to rush, the time offs, the duties, training, massive water hydration parades, and even the hand jobs to past time. Naturally we do see certain bits that fell victim to the censor's scissors, but somehow I'm not really complaining.<br/><br/>And the cinematography is brilliant. With the aid of digital effects, the desert never looked so blinding in the day, and so alluring in the night. The oil-fire smoke-filled night sky looked awesome, and so real, you could feel the heat and the oil droplets raining from above. And the pop music interjected at various points in the movie, is just groovy and adds to the flavour.<br/><br/>However, at certain points this movie cuts a bit too close to Apocalypse Now with scenes of war machinery cutting its way through the desert land, and in scenes where the troops go berserk in their chilling and celebration, though an earlier scene somehow prepared you for its upcoming similarities. Also what I thought was a minor technical boo-boo, keep a look out for the dust covers on the rifles. Hmm.<br/><br/>This is my recommended movie for the week to all NS personnel; you'll definitely find something you'll identify with. And to the rest of the folks, never mind about the war setting, this is one intense drama that might just appeal to you. Welcome to the suck."

"SnoochieBoochiesARGH","9","0","1","31 January 2006"," review - great movie
","Jarhead By Alex Schuurbiers<br/><br/>Sam Mendes' Jarhead is based on Anthony Swofford's book about operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. It features Jake Gyllenhaal (as Anothony 'Swoff' Swofford), Peter Sarsgaard (as marine Troy) and Jamie Foxx (as Staff Sergeant Sykes). Set in the Saudi Arabian desert, the movie portrays the mental breakdown which the marines in combat  if you must call it that  are subjected to. If you are looking for a bloody war flick a la Saving Private Ryan, look elsewhere, because this unconventional war picture deliberately fails to include messy battle scenes, which is to be expected of a movie concerning the Gulf War.<br/><br/>The first segment of Jarhead  the marine boot camp  boasts some slight similarities to Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. The nervous recruits, the monstrous drill sergeant, the ruthless combat training and of course the infamous ""this is my rifle""-speech. The main difference being, of course, this time it's not another Vietnam film. You get to know the narrator (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his platoon, a bunch on unruly young men with high hopes. Jarhead manages to depict an intense yet funny view of Swoff's regret of joining the marines. <br/><br/>In one of the most intense parts of the movie, the marines are watching the helicopter scene from 'Apocalyse now'. For those of you not familiar with the scene, (be ashamed, I suggest you go watch it immediately) helicopters fly over a beach in Vietnam, shooting the locals, with Wagner's 'Ride of the Valkyries' resounding at full volume. In Jarhead, you see the Marines singing along at the top of their lungs, as if it were their national anthem. They want to be in combat, they want to fight, they want to kill. Ultimately, they are flown to the Middle East to defend their country and 'kill some Iraqi scum'. <br/><br/>Once in the desert, the Marines are ordered to stand by until combat commences. This takes quite a bit longer than expected. The platoon is tested to the limit, both physically and psychologically. The days are long. Swoff & Co. are faced with several devastating situations, from playing football in NBC suits to cheating spouses. As an audience, you get so sucked into the movie that you actually want to see fighting and bloodshed, because the waiting is taking it's toll. <br/><br/>Overall, Jarhead is an excellent movie. Excellent. Sadly enough, it missed out on any Academy Award Nominations. The movie contains beautiful monologues, which give you an unprecedented look inside a Marines mind. Surprisingly, it also has a great sense of humor, even though it's quite heavy. The use of music in the film was first-rate and perfectly timed, with Bobby McFerrin's 'Don't Worry Be Happy', Nirvana's 'Something in the Way' and Kanye West's 'Jesus Walks'. Also, the striking imagery of burning oil wells got stuck in my mind for days. Jake Gyllenhaal did an excellent job at portraying the demise of Swoff's mental state, but I think Peter Sarsgaard's stunning performance as his troubled companion and mentor outshines the rest. Make love, not war, go see Jarhead. Welcome to The Suck."

","The film is a simple tale of men caught up in a modern war in modern times. Real men that could live next door to anyone. Because I'm British I thought I would have a problem with the US angle on the film, but at the end of the day, it could have just as well been a UK production. Maybe that's the Sam Mendes touch.<br/><br/>This was one of those films that leaves a series of pictures behind it. Burning oil fields. Raining oil. Burnt corpses. The evil, but soft at heart, staff sergeant. Lots of shouting. Male camaraderie. The coming home parade. It is a bit like the beginning of a good TV mini-series, but just as you are about to start caring about the characters, the film gives up on them. Now that would be a good time to start the TV series."

","Jarhead isn't your typical combat action-war film. In fact it's probably the most unconventional war drama out there. There are no scenes of action, combat, or firefights, and you'd think that that would make Jarhead a boring and uninteresting war film. Well the answer is strangely No. Jarhead does have a moment or two where boredom settles in briefly, but the film is never really uninteresting. The film is based on the book, of the same title, written by former Marine Anthony Swofford (played here by Jake Gyllenhaal). Anthony enlists in the Marines hoping to make something out of himself. He goes through basic training; where he practices and becomes a top ranking sniper. He develops a ""taste"" for what they call the ""pink mist"", that's a head shot, or kill shot for those of you who were wondering.<br/><br/>Once he and his platoon are finished with Basic they're shipped off to Saudi Arabia where they wait for action and then they wait some more, and then some more. The lack of action and the soldier's lust to ""get some"" is eating them up inside. They're bored, and they've been highly and thoroughly trained for combat, but the waiting game is killing them. The war is being mostly fought and won by the ""zoomies"" (that's what the Marines call fighter jets). The soldier's are not only suffering from boredom, but also from sexual frustration. They all wonder if their girlfriends are cheating on them, or will dump them. They seem to have very little belief that they'll remain faithful to them while they're away at war, and a couple of them aren't, as can clearly be seen in one particularly shocking scene. There's also another pretty shocking nightmare scene that puts the Nirvana song Something in the Way to great use.<br/><br/>Jarhead is less about fighting a war, and more about a soldier's mental state while at war, especially when dealing with the itching nerve to want to be in the middle of combat putting your skills to the test. It can drive some men mad. Jarhead isn't about politics, it's about men, not exactly soldiers (they're men first, soldiers second). The first half of Jarhead is almost a comedy, with a number of goofy moments and dark humor. Then the film slides into the surreal as men are riding on the edge of battle. The scenes with the burning oil fields is darkly haunting and at the same time beautiful. Jarhead isn't Black Hawk Down, it isn't a film about diving into chaos and rescuing your buddy, it's about the way men are in the places and situations of war. The film delivers a number of strong performances from good actors surrounding Gyllenhaal, like Jamie Foxx as Staff Sgt. Sykes (he plays his role very realistically and funny) and Peter Sarsgaard as Troy, Swofford's closest friend.<br/><br/>Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty and Road to Perdition) has created the first real war film that fully immerses the viewer in what it's really like to be a soldier, but surprisingly without any combat, and somehow it still succeeds. I should also mention the film's score by Thomas Newman, like all of his scores, is absolutely sensational, and really helps set the tone and rhythm. The film's unrestrained, unflinching look at male soldiers is strangely unique and fascinating. Most war films have a particular message to tell you, in Saving Private Ryan it was the shocking brutality of war, and in Black Hawk Down it was what drives men to go into dangerous, chaotic situations, but in Jarhead I'm not so sure there's a message to learn. Jarhead is more like real life, it's pointless, and it's more of an experience and a state of mind than a lesson. It's a story about men in uniform, and the uniform doesn't change anything, they're still a man underneath. If Mendes has said anything in Jarhead it's ""once a solider, always a solider"". You take those experiences with you, and no matter what you do with the rest of your life you'll always be a soldier. The main thing I said to myself after watching Jarhead was, ""Well, that was surprisingly different... and good."" And sometimes different is all a film really needs to be in order to work, and Jarhead works. This is one of my favorite films of the year, and one of my favorite war films, right along side Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down."

","The way that this film captures the anger and frustration of the soldiers is outstanding! It's true when they say that this is a war movie, but not, as throughout the duration you see that however much training you have to be a soldier, you can't fight boredom! This film really makes you understand how easy it is to want to kill if you've been sent to a war and not seen any action. The scene where he has been sent out to take out an enemy in the tower... ...brilliant! It makes you so angry that you just want him to ignore his orders and take the shot anyway! One slight problem is that the end was a little long, but the time could have easily been invested back into the film."

That way you can happily avoid disappointment.<br/><br/>I found the film not only informative, which i'm sure was half of the point, and also very entertaining. A film such as this, with no strong story line to follow, Almost counts on strong characters throughout the film: the cast, in my opinion, definitely delivered. Jake Gyllenhaal, aka Swoff, was entirely watchable in every scene. Jamie Foxx was genuinely intriguing and Sarsgaard's performance was nothing short of perfect.<br/><br/>Brilliantly shot, darkly humorous and beautifully acted. Don't go and see it if you're expecting a death-fest, no re if you want your typical beginning, middle, end... morale. I give this film a 9.

"brainball","8","0","1","23 January 2006"," interesting to say the least
","I must say that before watching my expectations were that Jarhead was going to be another action based movie trying to make a point somewhere between the action scenes. I was wrong, the movie in my opinion shows a part of soldier life that is normally not ofter portrayed in Hollywood movies (or hardly any movie made anywhere). Most movies try to idolize war, a war full of heroes and tough guys. This movie shows part of another side of war, the boring and mind wrecking part. The part that contains hardly any fighting or heroism. Which doesn't give you the happy satisfaction feeling after wards, but makes you silent for a moment. Not silence in reverence or shock, but to process the concept.<br/><br/>In my opinion this is a movie that is well justified with the 7+ overall rating it has. Definitely worth seeing, even for those generally not attracted to war or action movies."

I think the movie doesn't know whether to be an intelligent independent style movie or a full on studio blockbuster. The real problem I had with the movie is that it's very hard to have any real feelings for any of the characters. You are therefore left feeling rather cold throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The movie follows a few marines during the first gulf war. We follow them from their original training through to the conclusion of the war. I believe this has been touted as an anti war movie. I had difficulty in seeing exactly where this point was made, but there again maybe our 24/7 television news culture is probably making most of us in the west somewhat desensitised to violence.<br/><br/>This isn't a bad movie it's just not in the same league as Full Metal Jacket which really does shock you into a reaction."

"ExpendableMan","7","0","1","19 January 2006"," Sam Mendes goes to war
","The indelible stamp of the classic Vietnam war movies are all over Jarhead, the new movie from Sam Mendes, writer of American Beauty and Road to Perdition. From the opening boot camp sequence that couldn't be more in debt to R Lee Ermey's turn as the drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket, to the boys in the platoon psyching themselves up for the first Gulf war by watching the helicopter attack sequence in Apocalypse Now and joyfully singing along to 'Ride of the Valkyries.' However, the similarities end there, for rather than being a Vietnam movie set in a desert, Jarhead is an altogether different beast.<br/><br/>It tells the true life story of Anthony 'Swoff' Swofford, (a fantastic Jake Gyllenhall), a twenty year old marine sniper who gets shipped out to fight the Iraqi army and the experiences he has there. Rather than being met by all-out carnage and bloodshed though, Swofford finds himself faced with many long, boring months sat out in the desert with nothing but his platoon mates for company. Once there, he finds himself falling into a routine of sleep, eat, exercise, masturbate and sleep again, all the while waiting for a war that when it finally does come, is over in a heartbeat (""four days, four hours and twenty minutes, that was my war""). It is no surprise then that tempers become frayed and frustrations come to the surface in many ugly ways (Swofford finds himself ranting at a fellow soldier at one point while sticking an M16 into the terrified man's face) and the end result is deeply uncomfortable. These are men bred for war, who didn't get to have one.<br/><br/>In this respect it's certainly an intriguing watch and to add to the experience, the cinematography is stunning. The desert shimmers with such radiance you can almost feel the heat rising from the screen and the sight of a blazing, oil drenched field is a veritable feast for the eyes.<br/><br/>If a criticism can be levelled at Jarhead though, it would be that it doesn't have a strong political message. Sure, the American military machine is glorified in the first half then ruthlessly savaged in the second as men who are bred to kill break down in tears or go mad, but given the current political climate, many will certainly feel let down that there aren't more stabs at the nature of the modern day Iraq situation. Peter Saarsgard may provide a angry tirade about how they're fighting for oil, not people, but it's a brief shot in a film that otherwise asks the viewer to draw their own conclusions."
"happy_hangman","Null","0","1","18 January 2006"," War. What is it good for?
","'Jarhead', the latest offering from 'American Beauty' director Sam Mendes is an odd compote. In part it tries to emulate Altman's 'MASH', emphasising the juvenile testosterone fuelled antics of a close-knit group of servicemen in combat, and in the long days and weeks of tedium which occupy most of their times. Oddly - save for a few almost throwaway observations on the reasons for baby-sitting the oil-fields of Said - politics is pretty much kept out of the picture. This is a problem. How can a film set during the first Gulf War, where the indigenous populations of the occupied or protected territories are routinely referred to as 'Rag Heads', be considered without a political context? No doubt this reluctance to weigh his characters down with conflict-specific political baggage is intended to emphasise the universality of the old adage that War Is Hell, but without this context the characters become little more than military-movie archetypes: the sensitive but patriotic hero who discovers the army isn't what he thought it would be, the weedy grunt, the badass career soldier, the redneck, etc., etc.. This is a shame, as there are some very good performances here. Jake Gyllenhaal is an engaging leading man, bringing to mind, at times, a young Alan Arkin in 'Catch 22', and Peter Sarksgaard is excellently focused (if, as ever, slightly creepy) as his Scout Sniper partner. They are, however, working with an undemanding script. It's very stylish and impressively filmed  but it lacks the intensity of the (oft referenced) 'Apocalypse Now', the surreal nightmarish quality of 'Catch 22', or the bittersweet satire of 'MASH'. A good film which descends all-too-suddenly into sentiment in it's final act, determined to make a point  but not sure what point it wants to make."

","JARHEAD (15) DIR: SAM MENDES<br/><br/>In case anybody was unsure, war is apparently hell. Just ask Captain Benjamin Willard in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979). Or Private Chris Taylor in Oliver Stone's Platoon (1986). Not to mention Private Ryan. Hell even Forrest Gump told us that (But you ain't got no legs... etc etc). So why do we need to learn this again? Going into Jarhead, all that was on my mind was that it was the new film from the director of American Beauty, starring the man from Brokeback Mountain (which I loved). So even if I already knew that war was indeed hell, I might as well hear their side of it, not being familiar with Anthony Swofford's novel.<br/><br/>The film starts out showing the various dehumanising techniques that the grunts go through. Incredibly nasty drill instructors sapping any spirit that these young pretenders may have had, the main character then doubting his decision to join the marines, and of course, lots of boisterous marines behaving impetuously. Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his friend Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) are training to become snipers. To them it's great. A chance to finally see some action. Instead of being behind a desk doing mindless office work. But once the war starts, the action seems to have taken a vacation. And that's what Jarhead is all about. The banality of modern war, and the obsolete soldier who is sent to fight it.<br/><br/>The motif of Jarhead is pretty similar to the war films that we have already been enduring ever since the end of Vietnam. There was nothing in the opening twenty minutes that I hadn't seen in Stanley Kubrick's overlooked Full Metal Jacket (1989). At the beginning of the film the protagonist is somewhat reserved. An apprehensive intellect who reads Camus and is doing his duty in light of his father, who served in Vietnam. As the film goes on, he is eventually one of the boys, and to some degree is in fact a leader to the boys, which made me think of Platoon (1986). Even David O. Russel's superior Three Kings (1999) covers a lot of themes being discussed by Sam Mendes. <br/><br/>The cast are all very good. Jake Gyllenhaal now has the tag of the intellectual leading man. Jamie Foxx is hitting so many high points at this point in his career it's hard to believe he used to do Saturday Night Live. But the film's biggest strengths lie in it's cinematography and it's black humour. There is one scene in which the soldiers sit down and watch Apocalypse Now with sadistic and ironic glee. These are men who want to fight, but don't need to. And as such, end up driving each other mad. The modern soldier is not one who is pelted with bullets and fights his way through the mud. As the protagonist says in his voice-over ""There is no solution for mental unbalance"". It is not anti-war, nor is it pro-war. It is merely questioning the position of the modern soldier. He is taught the love his rifle, and to be prepared ALWAYS. But for what? Where is the danger? And in the heat of the desert, with his fingers itching over the tempestuous trigger, what is he to do? There is one scene later in the film where a Vietnam war veteran jumps on one of the parading trucks with all the marines. He tearfully embraces the soldiers, and congratulates them on winning. It is perhaps the darkest, and yet funniest moment in the film. Vietnam was a both a mental and physical hell. Kuwait was a mental and physical bore fest. And whilst a film about boredom never looks good on paper, Sam Mendes has done enough to make it both engaging and insightful, even it is reminiscent of superior work gone by."
"Chris_Docker","8","0","1","16 January 2006"," A rifle can be a possessive lover . . .
","Jarhead War movies and anti-war movies cover such a wide range that one can be forgiven for wondering what the latest offering will be. Left wing protest? All-American hero? Action-thriller? Historical? Often spanning several genres, our cinematic take on humanity's bloodiest of pastimes even throws up comedies and romances. Although the Gulf War film Jarhead can be taken as a critical comment on U.S. Marine core training (shades of Full Metal Jacket), a meditation on the pointlessness of war (humour akin to Catch 22), or one man's bird's-eye unexpurgated view (it's based on a real-life chronicle), its real focus (echoed at the beginning and the end of the film) is the psychological trauma of being a soldier, holding a rifle, living through a warzone and becoming, ultimately, so obsessed with that function that it never leaves you, even afterwards. ""Whatever else he may do with his life . . . he will always be a jarhead."" <br/><br/>We've long known the terrible mental effects war can have  from the 'shell-shock' of World War One to the lingering horrors of Vietnam, but it was perhaps with the Gulf War that such concerns came so much to the fore and so openly - with the discussion of 'Gulf War Syndrome' and other effects. A 1996 Veterans Association study, for instance, reported that Gulf War vets were 50% more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident than military personnel not sent to the Gulf War. What Jarhead does, far more explicitly than, say, Full Metal Jacket or The Deerhunter, is make the link between training that might be likened to brainwashing, and the end result of a personality that is devoid of anything that can take back ownership after military duties end. 'Jarhead' refers to the marines having heads like empty jars that are filled with what they are told to be filled with. In psychological terms, the military gives a person a lot of skills that can be used outside, and a person signs up for it knowingly  these and many other features distinguish it from more 'evil' forms of 'brainwashing' - but the intentional breaking of the ego and re-building it in a manner to suit the military objective, whatever name we call the process, is a powerful and often permanent catharsis.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal shines as the intelligent young recruit playing 'Swoff' (Anthony Swofford). He realises after a certain amount of mind-numbing humiliation that maybe he doesn't want to be a marine after all. His buddy (with a criminal record) is the opposite  and can't wait to 'kill something'. Many of the men are a rational 'in-between' and intellectually justify or genuinely love their job (although we wonder in the case of the staff sergeant, ably played by Jamie Foxx, if his glorying in the wonderful career and the unique opportunity of sights such as the oil fields on fire isn't reflected in the fact that he might not be fit to do very much else).<br/><br/>The storyline is jumpy in parts, enlivened by escapades as the marines wait endlessly for action, but it is more than compensated by a brilliantly witty script and adaptation. The humour outshines the screen version of Catch 22 and captures some of the irony of Three Kings (scenes of burnt-out, fleeing Iraqi family cars) as well as the fact that the soldiers have little knowledge or interest in why they are fighting a war other than to ""kick some Iraqi ass."" Director Sam Mendes has scored another success that comments on dysfunctional almost as poignantly as his earlier American Beauty. As the returning troops ride a bus back home as part of a welcome brigade, a down-and-out Vietnam vet jumps onboard to congratulate them, peeling the veneer of success from scenes of banner-waving smiling girls. As the final credits fade, we hear the chant, ""All my life I've had this dream: to be a bad motherf*cker US Marine."" The film seems to say to us: ""Be careful what you wish for."""
"t-kingsley","3","0","1","16 January 2006"," Jack of All Trade, but Master of None
","Apparently, Jake Gyllenhaal was SO desperate to be in this movie that he told Sam Mendes (the director) that he'd do ANYTHING! I wonder if he now regrets his keenness, for having appeared in such brilliance as ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" it's a pity to see such a promising young talent in generic ho-hum films like ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and this one. The main failing with ""Jarhead"" is that it's a Jack of All Trades, but a Master of None. It knowingly apes so many other films (like ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Catch 22"", ""MASH"", ""Full Metal Jacket"" and even ""The Odd Angry Shot"") that by doing so, it holds itself out for comparison and fails, miserably, against every one. Okay, so it's covering fresh ground (the Gulf War), but, to be honest, the brutal training and the 'filling in the boring bits between the fighting' are still the same. It's unfortunate that the tag-line for the film is ""Welcome To The Suck"" because the film does."
"stereoplaysjunk","8","0","1","15 January 2006"," When the going gets tough...
","It's true to say that Brit director Sam Mendes has dazzled us, over the years with some truly fabulous pieces of cinema and with Jarhead, he doesn't fail to wow his audience... again.<br/><br/>As practically the only female in the cinema, I was in awe of the darkly humorous script and great breakdown-of-sanity acting by the fabulous Jake Gyllenhaal.<br/><br/>Jarhead is helped along by a great cast of actors, including Jamie Foxx as the ever-so enthusiastic Staff Sgt. Sykes, and a brilliantly mellow Peter Sarsgaard as the one who flips out at the end. <br/><br/>This film tells of the boredom of the Gulf War. The American troops are in the desert for almost six months and not-so slowly we see our main character, Swoff (Gyllenhaal) losing his marbles. <br/><br/>I truly believe that Gyllenhaal is one of American's most promising and talented young actors and I certainly hope that his very different roles in Brokeback Mountain and Jarhead take this fabulous actor on to much bigger and better things. <br/><br/>The film offers some unusual insight into the sheer boredom the Marines experience whilst awaiting some field action. There's a fabulous scene between nerdy Fergus and Swoff, in which Gyllenhaal again shows his amazing credibility as an actor and we get some real emotion from the two guys. Perhaps the best breakdown of the mental state in a while.<br/><br/>All in all a great little war film, an unusual take on what most directors cloud with politics is in fact an unpolitical, brazen and interesting movie, littered from beginning to end with real, dark humour that even the most intelligent of you will be sniggering along with."
"Tbraddill","8","0","1","15 January 2006"," Funny Yet Tragic Drama
","Sam Mendes is an Oscar winning director and it shows why in this heartfelt film. From the opening to ending voice-overs he creates one of the funniest yet tragic movies of the year. It details the lives of the men who invaded Iraq the first time round and shows their pain and angst as they wait for the war to come to them. Beautifully shot, it comes with a cracking script full of snappy one liners(""Don't use your dicks to measure the distance because they're too small!"") and a great supporting cast.<br/><br/>But at the centre of the film its Jake Gyllenhaal who truly shines. He captures Zwoff's Strong willingness to go to war, as his father did, but at the same time his vulnerable side shown when they find the burnt out vehicles and the fried bodies on the motorway as the civilians tried to escape. He is ""the"" rising star of Hollywood and its good to see it wasn't a one off stellar performance after the amazing ""Brokeback Mountain"". Had it been any other year, he would be going to the Oscars with nominations in hand but as a result 2005 has been such a great year for movies that only the best of the best will ever see the podium.<br/><br/>Also giving another Oscar worthy performance is Jamie Foxx, still riding high after the tour De force ride that was ""Ray"". But again it doesn't look possible due to the competition but you never know what could happen in Hollywood. Peter Sarsgaard is also fabulous as is Oscar winner Chris Cooper in his blink and you'll miss him cameo. The rest of the cast is great too, but would take all day to mention names.<br/><br/>An original, thought-provoking take on a well worn genre but luckily Mendes and his cast have pulled out all the stops to rise above the clichés. It'll make you laugh out loud for the first hour and then they get down to some good old gritty drama in the second. One of the best war movies i've seen in years, its just too bad that it won't get the awards interest it so truly deserves!"

"exterminator_99","7","0","1","13 January 2006"," Stunning yet distant war film
","Jarhead, based on the memoirs of Anthony Swofford, is a technically superb yet thoroughly distant film. Based on a book whose whole premise is a literal catarthism of personal experience, Jarhead the film is let down by a lack of perspective or individual expression.<br/><br/>The film starts well enough as Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) orates in voice-over the feelings associated with being a Marine, both during and after active duty. This monologue, conducted over a black screen, promises so much  this will be a film which tells story whilst extolling human emotion there in the heat of the battle (or non-battle as the case is in this film). Instead Mendes and scriptwriter William Broyles Jr dispense with narration. Understandably, narration bogs a film down, but here, where the account is based on an individual's own story, the audience yearns to know what is going through a 20-year old's mind as he prepares for war. This absence of a singular voice turns Jarhead into just another war movie: showing beefed up, frat-boy jocks displaced in a foreign land. While we can see the antics of the boys in the desert we are curiously at arms length from them. We do not inhabit the space that Swofford occupies as we are not 'inside' his head at all. Therefore, to the audience, Swofford the protagonist is just another grunt.<br/><br/>The film is something of a post-modernist take on war films themselves. It unashamedly name drops the most famous war movies, either directly, with shots of the troops viewing Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter, or indirectly, with an obvious homage to Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket at the start of the film. In his book Swofford called war movies 'pornography for soldiers' and here Mendes shows us the grunts woop-wooping the infamous helicopter strike from Apocalypse Now. For these boys, all they want is action. For a brief moment, a scene so often marked as portraying the Americans as ""evil white men"", as so famously put by Pauline Kael, is flipped on its head. The seductive might and power of the American military is being triumphed and the audience becomes one with the soldiers. Yet again, this scene would have been best served by a voice-over from Swofford explaining his thoughts (I have not read the book, but he apparently talks of wanting to rape and pillage the villagers from that scene). If Mendes is already name-dropping and using Apocalypse Now as a reference point, why not follow Coppola's use of narration (so brilliantly written by Michael Herr)? It's a sore point of distance that lets down what could have been a great movie instead of just a good one.<br/><br/>The performances are all strong. In fact as pieces of acting, both individually and as an ensemble, Jarhead is excellent. Jamie Foxx stands out as the brash Staff Sgt. Sykes, a tough but warm leader, while Gyllenhaal and Peter Saarsgard (as Troy, Swofford's sniping partner) also perform well. Gyllenhaal's character would have been more memorable had we been allowed deeper into his mind, but as such it is Lucas Black as Kruger, an unusually politically aware Texan, who stands out. His nuanced performance as someone obviously more aware than he appears helps make up for Gyllenhaal's spectre-like Swofford.<br/><br/>While the script might not be watertight, Mendes excels in cinematography and editing. The Marines are stripped of colour as the desaturated images of boot camp and the desert make them appear pale and ghostly. Mendes' staging of the burning oil fields is the film's highlight; the Marines walk in bright sun towards a black sky, slowly becoming enveloped in crude oil. Mendes has used CGI in this section of the film, but it looks great. As a collection of images, Jarhead is brilliant. Audio quality is excellent too  the various aural instances help invoke the feel of military life in the desert.<br/><br/>Mendes may have purposely avoided any comment about the current war in Iraq, oblique or obvious, to allow for better box office figures in the US. That's a cynical point of view however. This is Swofford's story and yes, there are scenes or dialogue that could references to the current situation  at one point Swofford says in voice-over, ""we are still in the desert""  but his point is not directed at the US, it's directed at his platoon and their enduring memories of the conflict. This is a movie about the Gulf War, nothing more. Anti-war media and commentators hoping Mendes would use this film as a protest platform will be disappointed. In the end, Jarhead is a good war movie, but one without a voice. It's a well-made, high quality film. It just fails to stir the emotions and make a genuine connection with the audience. For all its technical and visual brilliance, that is a real shame."

","I don't think its a very good film. I think my main problem was that outside of the oil fires, there wasn't anything visually to keep me interested. Conrad Hall was a real genius and because of him Sam Mendes' other two films look incredibly beautiful. This just looks like every other war film from the last ten years 'war is really bad so we should make it look grim by messing around with the colour'. I hate to be that simplistic about it but that's the impression i got. I suppose also in my opinion there are problems with the script which is really good when taken in its component parts but seem to add up to very little.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the acting is excellent all the way through, particularly Peter Sarsgaard, and like i said there are really good parts in the story and neat lines of dialogue.<br/><br/>Definitely not the worst film i've seen lately but failed to make a lasting impression on me."

","A Jarhead, we are told during this film, is the ""nickname"" for a US Marine and the implication is that he is an empty vessel. So it is with a certain amount of amusement that the term Jarhead also fits this movie very nicely.<br/><br/>It is empty. Devoid of interest. Actually, the early part of the movie isn't too bad. But once the film moves beyond the Marine's training and heads out to the desert, you should consider heading out of the theatre. Nothing remotely interesting happens. Instead we are treated to what I assume is meant to be a shocking indictment of war, the men that fight it and the futility of it.<br/><br/>The movie does sum up one thing rather well, however. I heard a comment some time ago, about how war is ""99% boredom followed by 1% of panic-ridden terror"". This movie takes that comment to the extreme by providing a few minutes of interest in an otherwise dull two hours running time.<br/><br/>Summary: It's a war-movie and not that good. Characters appear one-dimensional and the story is flat and uninteresting. With the exception of Wind-Talkers its far and away the most boring war film I've watched in the past few years."

","There are lots of people who love this and film and many more that hate it..<br/><br/>In my understanding, those who love this film understand why the film was made, which was to show that some of the marines in the first Gulf War just waited and waited and waited ... and that the war that they had signed up for, was not what they expected.<br/><br/>Those who love it accuse those who hate it of them wanting more action etc ... Firstly, when you advertise a film heavily suggesting that it contains a lot of action, then there are people who are undoubtedly going to be disappointed. <br/><br/>But this is not the reason, why I did not like this film. The reasons why i did not like this film are pure characterisation and writing. The characters had hardly any journey or arc at all. Only Jake G's character when he temporarily goes insane amounts to any kind of character development. When the film begins, we do not know anything about his character, and to be honest, he does not change at all... The film changes around him. Aside from this, the other characters appear to have walked straight out of cliché school... We have the drill sergeant who does what every drill sergeant has done since Full Metal Jacket, we have Jamie Foxx's character who appears to be pure exposition (by this, I mean that he only really does anything when he shouts at the troops and tells them whats happening next) We have the remaining troops or are made up of stereotypical army school : the weird one with glasses, the slightly political one, the 'whoooping silly one', the mysterious one (peter skarsguard's character) and the sensitive one. <br/><br/>What the film actually does is allow the audience to hang out with these characters for almost the entirety of the film... which to be honest is like going to the zoo... Watch them act like children, play football, have interviews for TV (again straight out of Full Metal Jacket), they tease each other and they think about their girlfriends... ONce or twice they might meet some Arabs and camels. <br/><br/>This is not a film for me ... I can see what everyone is talking about in that ""but thats what it was like"" kind of manner. I do not watch a film to watch a bunch of marines being bored. I would prefer to watch them being tested or at least having an arc of character. There are two references to other great war films, The Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now ... well, the only reason for including these were to show that this was the kind of war that these marines were expecting ... apart from that ... for me, they just emphazied that I was watching a film that was not as good as those... And by not as good, I mean, the characterisation, and the power of performance and test of character ... I do NOT mean that they are better because of action or whatever..<br/><br/>Sam Mendes has said that people do not get this film... This is wrong. . I get it. I totally get it... Its two hours to make a very basic point. The film echoes of pretentious direction (notice the 'cool' music kicking in for many scenes) that attempt to hold more sentiment that what the audience are feeling (sorry, this audience member). <br/><br/>The simple thing is, that there was not a lot going on that made us care about the characters at all...."

At least that's how the posters and previews would have you believe. However it is as much a war movie as a porno without sex is a porno. Unlike 99.9% of the other war movies out there is almost no action. It is not ""Full Metal Jacket"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"", you won't be mesmerized by the realistic fighting scenes. The film also lacks a plot. There are no conflicts to be resolved. No climax. When the film ends, it does so abruptly.<br/><br/>The film is more of a documentary than a war movie. It offers insight into life in the USMC. This is where the film excels. Jake Gyllenhaal as Swoff manages to bring humor into the mind-numbing existence that they lived. Jamie Foxx (Staff Sgt. Sykes) and Peter Sarsgaard (Troy) also give excellent performances. ""Jarhead"" is educational - if not exceptional.<br/><br/>Without a doubt the best part of this movie is its soundtrack! It certainly helps the movie a lot. The cinematography is also very haunting. Many scenes like the highway of death leading out of Kuwait and burning oil wells are recreated to stunning effect.<br/><br/>All in all the film is worth seeing.

They go through difficult times,fun times,and confusing times. They carry out a plan to overcome their difficalties, and try to make better of the situation. They become closer to each other and learn what clicks and what doesn't. You the viewer get to see personal sides of people in the marine core and how hard it is for them to live in unison/live with each other without problems. They also learn to overcome their childish ways and act more like an adult. They find out that without freidns over there they will be really lonely. Like when Swaff (Jake Gyllenhaal) sees the horse with oil all over itself, he (may)sees that the horse has been abandoned and how lonely the horse Myst be and thinks of himself and how his relationship with his family.

"NateW","9","0","1","30 December 2005"," Breaking the modern war movie mold
","When it was released in 1998, Saving Private Ryan immediately established a new trend for future war movies. The quick, relatively painless deaths portrayed in older, more conventional war movies were replaced by brutal, incredibly graphic ones and battle scenes were more realistically laid out on screen. Then again, most of these movies centered around the casualty-ridden battles of older wars like WWII and Vietnam. In Jarhead, we get to see another side of human conflict; the minimal combat modern-day political war. The first Persian Gulf War, the focus of Jarhead, lasted less than 100 days and produced less than 200 American casualties, many of which were caused by friendly fire. For many troops who were deployed to the sands of Iraq and Saudi Arabia, there was no war. What do you do when you're sent to war and there's no war to fight? When you're trained to be a killer, what do you do when there's no enemy to kill? Jarhead examines these questions frankly, engrossingly, and memorably. The plight of Marines struggling to contain their boredom and insanity while an international conflict is raging on their doorstep is all too evident and real. It's a startling contrast to the loud, frantic ambushes of violence of other ""modern"" war movies in the mold of Saving Private Ryan. While Jarhead doesn't completely rationalize the questions posed, it's impossible to rationalize something as devastating as war. When all is said and done, it's a riveting look at another side of war that for the most part had been left unobserved. The images and words spoken by the movie's servicemen convey that sense of the unknown that only the field of battle can produce. In a small way, the audience will leave Jarhead feeling like they themselves have been to war."

Unfortunately I thought the Jamie Foxx and Chris Cooper characters they played needed more 'work' on being real marines, because after the initial scene with the drill instructor who obviously was a real drill instructor the other two characters fell somewhat short in credibility. I thought the movie strayed a little long trying to explain the feeling of boredom they had waiting to fight to the point of boredom. In retrospect there wasn't a lot of story to tell and it seemed like they tried to fill as much as they could. When they wanted to make a point the made it without any apologies at all and by the end of the movie you felt you were told the whole story and there was nothing left to tell. I can't help but have the feeling that they were rushed through this filming. I look forward to seeing other ""Desert Storm"" movies. This is a don't miss movie."

","Something new, finally.<br/><br/>In the story that tells about the Persian Gulf War in 1991, Jake Gyllenhaal tells the story as the soldier Anthony Swofford, a soldier who experienced firsthand the war with the Middle Easterners. A war that was filled with boredom, and complete isolation from the rest of the world, and how the world on the other side responded to them, which was responded in a graphic, disturbing, and almost tragic, way.<br/><br/>As part of being one of the late contenders in the year, ""Jarhead"" is a success to those who were there, and a failure to those who sat in their chairs and watched it from the seat of their comfortable dens and family rooms. Staff Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Foxx), is portrayed in positive light, and enforces his presence with every demanding breath that he takes in, in this film, not only for the purpose of the demanding man that he was, but the way that the war, and the film itself, should have been demanded, in a form of respect.<br/><br/>Another pleasant surprise has been touched on the big screen a lot in the past couple of months, as Peter Sarsgaard delivers a stand up performance as Troy, the spotter for Swofford, who was the shooter in their sniper Platoon, in this amazing triumph for dignity, pride, and national respect for the country that one mush fight for in order to come back as a hero, and a well honored soldier, not a coward.<br/><br/>You're in the army now. Now get down and give me 50."
"fincherfan22","Null","0","1","20 December 2005"," Imensly underrated!
","Probably the most underrated film of the year. Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition). Scores his third straight knockout, with this gripping Desert Storm manifesto. The best film since Three Kings to tackle the subject and definitely the most realistic. The film is taken from the true fist-person account of Private Anthony Swafford, who ever so poetically admits he joined the Marines because he ""got lost on the way to college."" Swofford (played sharply by ""I'm having the best year of my career"" Jake Gyllenhaal) is like so many other Marines, in the sense that he just wants to live up to the aspirations of his Viet Nam veteran forefathers and make his mark in history. Like all Marines, he becomes desensitized and lethal during basic training, and jumps at the opportunity to go to war. When he gets to Iraq, he finds that things are much different than he had imagined, and what unfolds is a gripping account of one man's torment as he slowly begins to lose his mind. People's major gripe with the film was that it didn't have enough action, obviously they missed the point. The boys didn't get to see any action either, and they long for that one kill. When they finally encounter death in the form of charred bodies, it's far less glamorous than they had anticipated. The film does an excellent job of keeping the focus on the first Gulf War and not the current debacle, and Jamie Foxx also gives another Oscar worthy supporting turn as a tough-as nails drill sergeant. One of the greatest wartime films of all time."

","Everybody knows that war is hell. ""Jarhead"" wants us to know that waiting around for war isn't so great, either, especially when one is forced to do it from within a testosterone factory, full of young men who have been led to believe that they'll be shooting some dark-skinned, moustachioed types any minute. It's enough to make you crazy.<br/><br/>Enough to make Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenahll) crazy, at least. It doesn't take long for Swofford to second-guess his decision to enlist in the Marines. ""Jarhead"" opens with a sort of homage to the famous Paris Island portion of Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket."" No tragic murder-suicide in this case, but around when his drill sergeant starts slamming heads into walls and shouting about his sexuality, Swofford begins to assume a glazed, jaded look. He's as excited as anyone else when his unit is ordered to Kuwait as part of Operation Desert Shield, though predicts on the plane that they'll be back before they've digested their complimentary peanuts. He whoops and hollers with everyone else at a rousing speech by the commanding officer full of references to ""the bureaucrats in Washington,"" kicking Iraqi ass, and other soldierly musings.<br/><br/>But the ass-kicking doesn't seem to materialize. There's plenty of running around in the desert, target practice, and football games. Swofford's Staff Seargeant (Jaime Foxx) loves to pull surprise gas raid drills. A few of these ""jarheads,"" though, are sharp enough to notice that reality on the ground is quite a bit different than the official line, parroted gleefully by a lot of their comrades who can't wait to start killing Arabs. It's this cognitive dissonance that's at the heart of director Sam Mendes' movie. These guys have been pumped full of military hokum about the mysticism of their rifles, being killing machines, and the importance of the Corps, but life in the desert is largely consumed by domestic issues back home, and the killing of nothing more than time. There's a pressure-cooker of aggression here that's got no release valve. Swofford, at least, begins to lose his bearings. He shoves his gun in a comrade's face, and when the bombs do start falling, he can only stand there in a daze. As one marine points out, though, the war moves way too fast for troops on the ground. By the time they get mobilized, air strikes have pushed the front miles further back. Even the sight of a charred Iraqi convoy, strafed while trying to flee, arouses little emotion. The pilots are actually fighting the war; the grunts on the ground just sort of hang around it.<br/><br/>""Jarhead"" at times feels unfocused, but I think that's the point. Combat and killing are psychologically scarring, but so is preparing people for such, then leaving them to wait in uncertainty. Back home in a victory parade, a Vietnam vet hops on the unit's bus to offer congratulations personally. He sits down, clearly having a moment of profound emotional connection with these new returnees. Swofford seems both to understand completely and feel miles apart. Combat isn't the only terrible thing war has to offer. While perhaps less intense in the moment, the buildup, aftermath, and peripherals exact a psychological toll as well, and create their own demons."
"GloriaT","8","0","1","10 December 2005"," A War Movie With No Heroes
","""Jarhead"" is not a war movie in the accepted sense, even though it follows the adventures of its lead character from Camp Pendleton to the Saudi desert and into Iraq as part of Desert Storm in 1991. Instead, director Sam Mendes has created perhaps the first post-Vietnam film of war without heroes. <br/><br/>The movie is the story of one man's descent into Hell. That man is Marine Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal), who realizes his mistake as soon as he is assigned to a company of screw-ups who welcome him ""to the suck,"" Marine jargon for their otherwise beloved Corps, by pretending to burn a crude USMC brand into his leg. Swofford recovers but is chronically sick. As he reads the existentialist masterpiece ""The Stranger"" in the head, trapped by destiny and his Staff Sergeant (Jamie Foxx), who uses artifice to rekindle Swofford's interest in the Corps, at the same time tossing Camus away, replacing the book with a sniper rifle.<br/><br/>""Jarhead"" steals its most rousing war scenes from Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now,"" which it quotes in a film-within-a-film scene, with the Marines being shown the Vietnam war classic at their base movie theater. As Robert Duvall's helicopters prepare to unleash their rockets on a village, and Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" is just about to reach its crescendo with the Marines in the audience humming loudly along, suddenly the lights come up and the projection halts. A voice over the loudspeaker advises the soldiers they are shipping out forthwith. It's a classic case of coitus interruptus, and the only consolation is the tinny voice urging them all to ""Get some!"" But these jarheads won't be seeing real action any time soon. Instead, they stage in the desert, train and fight only boredom. <br/><br/>Meanwhile Swofford is fast-tracking into insanity. Despite the Staff Sergeant's reminders that Swofford, now a Marine sniper, is part of a team, there is no esprit de corps. It is as if all camaraderie was killed back at Camp Pendleton, when a Marine was accidentally shot during training, a chilling foreshadowing of more senseless dying to come. Repeatedly, Swofford is filmed apart from his fellow grunts, separated by a tent flap, or venturing alone to parlay with some Arab men in the desert. Swofford knows some Arabic, but this intellectualism serves only to further isolate him from his fellows, many of whom are portrayed as stupid. Even the Marines' own government issued gas masks isolate the men from each other. <br/><br/>If the viewer has any doubts that Hell is the destination, these are swept away when ""The Mother of all Battles"" finally begins and Swofford's unit heads into the Iraqi desert to get some. The hauntingly original cinematography of war in the oil fields of Iraq, with burning oil wells, soot-covered sand, and even an oil-soaked Arabian steed, leave no doubt that this is Hell. In one scene, Swofford wanders off and finds the burnt body of an Iraqi, with whom he sits, assuring the charred corpse that they both have had a rough day. <br/><br/>Swofford accepts his situation with the existentialism of the hero of ""The Stranger,"" Meursault, who kills one more Arab in Camus' book than Swofford will during Desert Storm. While Foxx acquits himself well as the Marine Staff Sergeant, he fails to bring anything new to the cigar-chomping persona with sadistic tendencies, who has become so familiar to audiences from such disparate films as Stanley Kubrick's Vietnam War ode ""Full Metal Jacket"" and Ridely Scott's ""Aliens."" Sykes confides in Swofford his personal reasons for choosing to stay in the Marines by pointing to the desolate landscape of burning oil wells. Foxx's character fell in love with war and never wants out. He even speaks in vintage Vietnam War military slang: Americanized French and Vietnamese words, picked up no doubt in Indochina a quarter century earlier. Despite Swofford's acceptance of his fate, he wants only to finish his tour of duty and muster out of the Corps. <br/><br/>When Swofford and his sniper teammate return from a mission to discover their unit celebrating insanely in the desert night, we are treated both to an homage to Coppola's inspiration for ""Apocalypse Now,"" namely, Joseph Conrad's novella Heart of Darkness, and to a visceral vision of the breakdown of civilization. These half-naked Marines, dancing wildly in the firelight, could, for all their apparently unreasonable savagery, be the very cannibals of the Congo described in Conrad's book. After the war, Swofford loses the high and tight Marine haircut that spawned the term jarhead, and returns to civilian life, but he can't lose the suck, that's with him till Death do them part. Semper Fi."

","This seems to be a good explanation of the anarchy of war, especially in the 1990 to 1991 period depicted. The irony is that Saddam Hussein is now seen by many as a harmless dictator, who never deserved persecution by the United States military and who never possessed weapons of mass destruction, according to several leaders of the Democratic Party. This film, however, shows the real Saddam, the user of nerve gas against defenseless Kurds and the worst environmental polluter of all time, in regard to his gratuitous setting of oil wells on fire in 1991. So, this is a good word for simple truth, instead of the lies and distortions offered by Howard Dean and his ilk. And, the Marines, as depicted by Jake Gyllenhaal and his healthy band of brothers, are simply the well-trained instruments of retribution against Saddam's terrorism. All of the ugliness and the beauty of Marine training and the war itself are described, for those contemplating life among these proud warriors. And, these Marines can be especially proud of defeating the worst war criminal of all time, Saddam Hussein."
"bchandler-4","6","0","1","11 December 2005"," Movie takes a completely different view than the novel
","As far as war movies go, this one isn't bad. The cinematography is absolutely stunning, and the way Mendes plays with colors is truly beautiful. The marine language is real. But, if you're looking for something meaningful, you probably won't find it.<br/><br/>I read the novel before seeing the movie, and the two are completely different. Perhaps the most important change that Mendes made was to move chronologically. Jarhead the novel is more like a bunch of short stories that share a common thread, and its disjointed time line helps emulate what Swofford must have felt as a soldier in a war that he didn't understand or know much about when he went.<br/><br/>Another important difference is the way Mendes portrays Swofford. In the movie, Swofford is portrayed as the typical, uninsightful grunt, but in his memoirs, Swofford shows far more intellect and poise. Although Jarhead is about the first Gulf War, much of what it has to say unintentionally relates directly to the current war and the culture of the military. The only remnant of this dialogue comes in Gyllenhall's epilogue before the credits roll. The novel also illustrates the seemingly endless cycle of family enlistment.<br/><br/>I guess the movie's portrayal of war is as real as it can be if you don't mind the omission of the effects on US soldiers. Details like the government forcing soldiers to take pyridostigmine bromide (PB pills), which are now under scrutiny for potentially having contributed to Gulf War Syndrome; jungle camouflage being issued for desert combat; UN conventions that hinder soldiers from doing their job; and Swofford's true reflections as a grunt, were omitted. In his memoirs, Swofford goes in depth about all this and more.<br/><br/>The movie chooses to focus only on Swofford's time in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, but only briefly looks at Swofford's life before and after the war. Before and after are when Swofford has the most pertinent commentary about war and the effects of war on soldiers and himself. Whereas in the movie the viewer feels like Swofford comes out mostly unchanged, Swofford's memoirs show him to be profoundly affected by what he did and didn't do in the war, his experiences with Post Traumatic Stress, and his difficulties readjusting to civilian life.<br/><br/>Although the novel is not anti-war, it is certainly not pro-war. Although Swofford clearly has his own opinions, he remains objective in providing depth, context, and understanding of the Gulf War and all wars. The movie seems to take the stance that war exists. Many of the characters from the novel were left out in the movie or their roles changed, and many events changed to either keep the movie short or change its end effect. Unlike Apocalypse Now, Platoon, and Full Metal Jacket, which are legends not necessarily because of their political views, but because of their originality in showing the lives and dilemmas of soldiers, Jarhead falls short.<br/><br/>Once again, the best part of the movie was the stylized cinematography. Cool, grainy colors were used for the desert, which helped make it seem realistic even though it was filmed in Cali. and Mexico. What I liked most about the movie was seeing the visual manifestation of Swofford's writing. Despite criticism for being too left wing, Hollywood has a tendency of making movies that seem a bit like propaganda and focus more on explosions and ""hooah"" moments rather than characters . Perhaps after all is said and done with the Gulf Wars, movies about them will begin to be more reflective. So it goes."

","it's going to be hard for you to understand this movie if you have never had any connection to the military. most civilians cannot comprehend how a man can love something that keeps giving him the sharpest point of the shaft, over and over. civilians do not understand the concept of ""sacrifice"" in the way that military men do. this movie accurately captured the waiting, the goofing-off, the capability of the American fighting man. it showed exactly how much you can hate something and still want to re-enlist in it. if you liked the movie, i also recommend reading the book--it goes further into depth of the mission of the STA 2/7 and the life of a grunt."
"anhedonia","6","0","1","7 December 2005"," There's something happening here, what it is ain't exactly clear
","It is impossible to watch ""Jarhead"" and not think about the current Gulf War. I realize the film takes place solely in the context of the first Gulf War, but you can't help but think about what's going on now.<br/><br/>One of the most salient points this film makes - and I don't know if it was intentional - is a rather subtle one. Throughout ""Jarhead,"" director Sam Mendes and screenwriter William Broyles Jr. point out how many days these soldiers have spent in the desert and how many of them there are. For much of the film - as we very well know from facts from the first war - they readied themselves for the invasion of Iraq. When it finally comes, there's a title imposed on the screen telling us there are 575,000 troops on the ground.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of President George H.W. Bush, but, at least, he knew how to properly carry out an invasion. He listened to his military commanders. Cut to Gulf War: Part Deux, run by his not-too-smart and incompetent kid, and you realize how incredibly botched and poorly planned this Iraq War was and is. We went in with fewer than 200,000 troops. Thanks, Dubya.<br/><br/>The point of ""Jarhead"" seems to be not that war is hell so much as that war can be downright boring, too. These are guys who are just itching to see some action, to blow some crap up. Instead, they're forced to wait, causing much frustration. In hindsight, of course, the waiting game seemed to make us better prepared. We, at least, seemed to have a plan then. And we didn't manufacture false WMD evidence or say that we needed regime change to oust a brutal dictator who, true, killed thousands, but was also one of our biggest allies and buddies when he did most of those killings, something no one in this administration or in the media ever points out.<br/><br/>The trouble with ""Jarhead"" is the soldiers' frustration can't really carry the whole film. Jake Gyllenhaal is awfully good as Anthony Swofford, waiting for his first sniper kill, and Peter Sarsgaard, again, turns in a wonderful low-key performance. This chap truly is fast becoming one of our finest film actors. But the rest of the cast, including Jamie Foxx and Dennis Haysbert, wind up in mostly throwaway roles. And many of the supporting characters seem cookie-cutter.<br/><br/>The film delves into the daily grind of the soldiers and their commanders' plans to keep the boys busy while awaiting the invasion. It's all about doing something to prevent from going stir crazy. But I really don't know if it makes for captivating cinema.<br/><br/>As beautifully shot, well acted and competently directed as ""Jarhead"" is, there were many times I wondered why exactly Mendes wanted to make this movie. If his point, indeed, was that war is boring, that is made abundantly clear early on. But there needs to be something more to a movie, too, and this one just didn't have it.<br/><br/>I'm glad I saw this movie, but I wanted more. I didn't want to be as bored as the soldiers were and, often, that's exactly how I found myself."

","With all that's going on in the world, why they chose this particular war to examine is beyond me. The story goes nowhere, which is the point, but the actors are wonderful, particularly Jake Gylenhaal. <br/><br/>The camera work is fluid and showy, but I felt it was often trying to tart up a story that needed some pizazz- and the music is, well, reminiscent to American Beauty.<br/><br/>I was disappointed with Peter Skarrsgard, I felt he coasted through the role that could have infused the film with a little energy.<br/><br/>All in all a very macho film with no place to go, perhaps this would have been brilliant ten years ago, but in this day and age it felt like I was watching a very well produced antique.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes, however, remains a director to watch."

","...with much less actual killing.<br/><br/>Anthony Swofford's memoirs of his time in the U.S.Marine Corps,mostly during the first Gulf War. This movie covers mostly the time between when he enlisted in 1989,through OPeration Desert Shield(August 1990 thru January 1991) and through the end of OPeration Desert Storm(March 1991).<br/><br/>People going into this film expecting a war action film a la ""Black Hawk Down"" or even ""We Were Soldiers..."" are probably going to come away from this film feeling shafted. While this movie is set in the Corps and the brunt of the action occurs during a War(albeit,not quite an official one),this is NOT that kind of movie. Instead,it seems like a low-energy,Roman a Clef about military life as seen through the eyes of Cpl.Anthony ""Swoff"" Swofford(Jake Gyllenhaal,who,if there was an official ""Hunk of the Year"" title,would at least a finalist for it),as he goes from determined,idealist who joins the Marines to follow in his Vietnam vet dad's footsteps to a somewhat disillusioned adult who,along with his platoon,becomes ever-more frustrated in his lack of chances to kill anybody. INstead,the Corps duty seems to be an endless tedium of staying prepared and...waiting. As they wait for their turn to fight,Swoff and his mates try to keep their wits,with very tenuous results.<br/><br/>I've read some of the threads on this site and I want to make something clear: I have no way of knowing how true Mr.Swofford's accounts are,and since I am not,nor ever was,a Marine,so I have to assume that his accounts are accurate. Also,I have not read the book(released in 2002,I think) that it is based on,so any claims that director Sam Mendes and co-writer William Broyles Jr. ""remade"" the original work to fit into a movie that was in any way different from the original work could be quite true. <br/><br/>What I do know(or believe) is that the elements of this film are very competently done,with particularly good turns by Gyllenhaal,Peter Skarsgard(as Swoff's platoon mate and steady hand Cpl.Troy)and Jamie Foxx(As the career Marine who is fully aware of the dangers and short-comings of his job,but couldn't be happier doing what he's doing all the same). This film is similar to ""Full Metal JAcket"",not just because it is set in the Marines but also because there is plenty of wry humor and blunt treatment of military life. The difference between it and FMJ is mostly marked in the difference between Vietnam and the first Gulf War.<br/><br/>This film seems to be a worthy watch for most,if not all,adult audiences. One will probably get a better appreciation of the movie if they go in looking for a story about the Marines themselves(as perceived through one of them)than about the work and duties they are charged with."

","There are war movies which are based on books, which are so complicated that the movie cannot be fully appreciated without first reading the book; for example, ""Catch-22"". ""Jarhead"" should not have been one of those movies. The film easily and brilliantly portrayed scene after scene needed to build Swofford's story and then, towards the end, seemed to drift away from that story towards some surreal quest for Oscar. Of course, nothing in the trailers had prepared me for this. I believe this film could have taken it's place among the great war films such as those it's own characters watched to ""pump up"".

Of course the star of the saga, Jake gy.... whatever, is one fine actor.

","""Jarhead"" is an autobiographical account of a Marine sniper named Anthony Swofford, based on his 2003 book of the same name, about his service in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait during Desert Storm in the early 1990's. It is obviously a war movie, but not in the sense that it is filled with combat and carnage - indeed, the 2 1/2 hours of the film are almost totally void of any combat whatsoever. It is a firsthand account of a group of men that were vigorously and relentlessly trained and prepared - all so they could sit and wait for months. How do you keep your mind and body on edge and, as their sergeant says, ""suspiciously alert"" when nothing ever happens? And if your mind and body are always thinking of battle, ready for combat, how do you handle months of stillness? The film answers these questions in an honest and unsettling way. For 2 1/2 hours, we get a small taste of the seemingly endless days of nothing that these highly trained Marines experienced. Sound like the war movies you're used to? <br/><br/>It was directed by Sam Mendes, whose 1999 film ""American Beauty"" won several Academy Awards,including Best Picture and Best Director for Mendes; Beauty is a gorgeous, darkly funny film about a 40-something nobody (played by Kevin Spacey) who experiences something of a personal renewal, which leads to a joyous, reckless lifestyle for the last year of his life, until he is murdered at the end of the film (If you think I have given something away, note the movie's opening line: ""I'm Lester Burnham. In less than a year, I'll be dead.""). He was also at the helm of 2002's ""Road to Perdition,"" the harrowing tale of a family man and his lingering mob connections, and their catastrophic results. I mention these previous works for two purposes: 1) to show that Mendes is a talented and capable filmmaker with a poignant visual style, and 2) to demonstrate that he is fit for tragedy, and apt to make films with dark reality as their center. ""Jarhead"" is nervously funny, and deals in a very subtle and poignant way with two dark and disturbing realities: the horror of war (a well-known, almost expected, theme for war movies) and the perhaps deeper horror of a wicked and mysterious tendency that lies in its participants.<br/><br/>Am I being elusive here? Perhaps there's no good way to put into words the emotions the movie provokes. It is given validity not only by the fact that it is based on a firsthand account of the war, but by its strong performances. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the narrator character, Anthony Swofford, and it is easily his best work, and shows us that we may see many more great achievements from this young actor. Excellent supporting performances also come from Jamie Foxx and Peter Sarsgaard."

","I thought the movie was compelling in its own right and touched many angles on humanity and human struggle. Camera movements and stills were right on to the story and very striking. The acting became very emotional at times and involved me very much so. Sarsgaard's performance at the end was particularly compelling and really showed the struggle of the marines. I voted it a nine out of ten as I thought it to the likes of Full Metal Jacket and Black Hawk Down. The film is not about politics, nor does it ignore them. It simply tells the story and from that reaches many aspects of human struggle and human relationships. The scene where Swoff (Jake Gyllenhaal) cannot finish masturbation to his girl back home whom he suspects of cheating was strong. Ernest Ozuna did a great job with his character that is so easily relatable to the Seargent in Full Metal Jacket, and so making the role that much more challenging. I would also recommend it as a DVD purchase when that is available."

It is hardcore realism that covers most areas of a soldier's life while over in the dessert, going through basic(only a small portion) going through more training before being shipped overseas.<br/><br/>Many of my military friends that are in the Corps do not like this movie, because they felt the characters shouldn't be in the Corps in the first place...there is great pride that they hold for Country, Corps and God. But in Reality there are individuals without class or intelligence like that in every unit, the guys let off steam it is reality it is normal given an abnormal situation. I am saddened that more people won't see or understand the conversion to military life, that more civilian spouses or family members...to give them an inside view of what our men/women face overseas.<br/><br/>Go with an open mind and see and you will realize there is a big difference between military life and civilian life and this movie shows that, also everything you give up to do the job they do."

","It's hard to see what all the fuss is about, concerning ""Jarhead."" I have not read the book, but it strikes me as the classic page-to-stage or page-and-screen problem: the real allure of the book is something about the tone, something about the voice, something that might only be approximated by a voice-over. Normally the prospect of tons of people going to see a movie where nothing happens would make me first in line, but this film just isn't about much, and nothing much is revealed other than that Marines are sex-starved, aggressive and bored. The special mark of this movie seems to be: nothing happens. While you will see many scenes of metaphor-challenged commanders orating to shiny (with oil) faced young would-be Audie Murphys, they will only distinguish themselves from the other 8,000 times you have seen this scene because: in that movie it served a purpose. Sure, Roger Deakins kicks ass, now give him something to shoot. I can't really understand how they spent so much time on this film, or so much money, or why Jake Gyllenhaal is getting so much acclaim, he's merely serviceable and not given much to do. Even one of my favorites, Peter Sarsgaard, is getting undeserved praise; his character, obviously underwritten to be seen immediately as a troubled kid with a violent past, instead comes across as the gravedigger from ""Garden State"" who got caught raiding the coffins and sent to the military. This makes his eventual fate all the more vague because I had no idea what sequence of events could have caused that to happen to him. This film could have been made with the exact same people in it by Killer Films or some indie outfit and would have greatly benefited by the tarted-up sheen that makes it all too apparent that ain't nothing' going' on and ain't much illumination coming out of that. What did they spend all the money on, anyway? It wasn't on actors, special effects, costumes, locations, maybe just on an overrated director. All three of his films so far have been full of skin-deep metaphor with purported deeper meaning. This one doesn't have the smugness of Kevin Spacey, but it still purports to be some sort of massive statement about the state of the soldier. Perhaps the accumulation of mundane details in the book transcends boring and becomes a statement about man's place in the universe or something, but not in this movie. Just rent Full Metal Jacket again, really. And remember, as one of the posts on this IMDb profile says: ""YOUR ANTI-American IF YOU DON'T SEE IT."" No, seriously, another problem with it is that its attempt to be anti-political just makes it pro-war. Sorry, but not to be explicitly against a war you are participating in (as Pat Tillman was recently revealed to be, incidentally) is to tacitly endorse it. Of course there isn't free-speech in the military, but then why is the person told to shut up against the war instead of for it? Telling that person that politics don't matter because they're there isn't like making a statement about reality and a present situation; it is a statement like telling people today that more lives should be wasted in Iraq to justify the other wasted lives and not insult their memory already, and as there are people shouting that the film was made by ""liberals"" and a director from the UK who hasn't served, let me say as an ACLU member that it is the sort of left-wing propaganda I could do without. It's about as left-wing as Joe Lieberman. The only real good I can see coming out of this film is that hopefully some of the military wives and girlfriends will think twice before two-timing their men overseas."

","I was both exhilarated and disappointed with this flic. Having had our surfeit of Vietnam War movies (one of which becomes a scene focus early in this film), it's nice to see the anti-war genre continue to promote the message using more recent conflicts. Photography is excellent; composition of scenes is vibrant; soundtrack is an integral part of the movie...vintage stuff that comments on the accompanied scene. <br/><br/>Gyllenhaal is a good actor but there are times when he slips out of character...when it seems to be him and not Swoff(ord); too much reliance on the eye shots (the 'windows-to-the soul' dramatic close-up) and too little attention to encompassing body language and gesture. Desert scenes are contrived but evocative. Does not attempt to be a realistic portrayal of Desert Storm or any other recent conflict but rather to be a gritty portrayal of 'normal' young men thrust into situations that no 'normal' civilized person should have to face.<br/><br/>It's partially successful in a comfortable, sanitized way. Tries to be realistic in exploitative ways which is a real pity because the message that is espoused doesn't need any phony emphasis. <br/><br/>Chris"

","When I went to see Jarhed, I was expecting something more along the lines of Black Hawk Down. What I got was a totally different thing. In some scenes, the movie was so realistic that it was almost boring, but in other parts it so unrealistic to the point of total BS, not in a good way. The writers basically took all the bad stuff that only a fraction of the people do in the Marines that nobody knows about, and put it in the movie. In addition to this, there were many things that were un-explained, especially towards the end of the movie. There is actually very little action in this movie, opposite of what I was expecting. Lastly, don't bring the kids to this movie. There is some mild nudity and major sexual content. There were at lest 100 people in the theater, and it would have taken all of them counting on their hands and feet to count how many times there was cussing. Also, every other scene either involves sex, or talking about sex."

","I had high expectations going into Jarhead, and I found it very disappointing. Considering that it's one of the few American movies to come out on a topic close to America's current involvement in the Middle East, I expected it to have at least a rigorously argued message, even though it would perhaps not be in agreement with my own personal views.<br/><br/>Jarhead is really not very deep at all in fact, it has very little message, and is more like a collage of army clichés, strewn together with potent performances by Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx. They both do a great job, and so do the rest of the cast. It seems to me that Sam Mendes' number one objective in this movie was not to hurt any audience member, and to basically be all things to all people. Though I have not read the novel on which this movie is based, and Mendes could argue that he was only doing the book justice, by putting on reel its lack of clear conviction, he clearly could have chosen one of the book's key dimensions and stuck to it. In any case, the failure of this movie lies squarely in the lap of the director and/or screenwriter. The story goes nowhere. I did find especially annoying some wannabe-artistic-deep scenes that fall totally flat and seem to come out of a cinema-student's scrapbook/study camera reel.<br/><br/>I regret having seen Jarhead at the theater. I must admit having been, once again, totally suckered into a half-baked movie by a good trailer and surrounding marketing efforts. I would barely recommend a DVD rental to anyone on this one, unless you have never been un/fortunate to see any war movie. This is the type of movie, where I really wish the theater would provide the disgruntled unhappy viewer, such as myself, with a refund, or at least a credit. Jarhead is the best demonstration of the reasons behind's Hollywood's current slump.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal (Swoff) - 9/10 - Very strong performance, even more deserving considering that his director clearly had no idea who Swoff was.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx (Staff Sgt. Sykes) - 8/10 - Good performance, but somewhere down the line, you feel that either Foxx realizes that he's wandering in useless cinema territory or that the tough sergeant role, he's portraying has been done to the bone, and that as a result, his input can be at best marginal.<br/><br/>Sam Mendes - 2/10 - The good news about his direction in this movie, is that you could probably cut this movie up into 5-10 superior short movies.<br/><br/>William Broyles Jr - Should just stop writing scripts, or return to his day job. Having checked his portfolio, I can now better understand all my prior comments, we are talking about the genius, who brought us Entrapment and the appalling Planet of the Apes. Plea to the studios: please do not give this gentleman any work, and if so, provide a clear advisory in the trailer or poster."
"André-3","4","0","2","11 November 2005"," A narrow view of a large calamity
","While my wife and I found the film interesting and worth the time and expense to view it, we also found it to be lacking in an important way.<br/><br/>Whether this was the intent or not, this film will be viewed by many as an insight into what the war in the Persian Gulf was. By focusing exclusively on the impact of the war on the lives of American soldiers, we are again presented with an incomplete view of a real event. A view that reiterates the hopefully false impression that the importance of any event is the impact that it has on the United States or its citizens.<br/><br/>One of the major impacts of the war in Iraq is the calamity that it has brought to the Iraqui population (whether or not it was for their own good is not the point). This essential dimension is totally absent from the film. In fact, I recollect less than 10 Arabs portrayed in that film (unless you count the corpses). If the impact of the war on the general population was not an important consideration in the soldiers' reaction to their war experience, this in itself is a highly revealing fact that needs to be presented.<br/><br/>In order to understand my concern about this film, imagine that someone made a film about the bombing of Germany and focused nearly exclusively on the experiences of the bomber pilots without covering in any way the impact of this bombing on the general population. Such a film would quite rightly be considered deeply flawed, no matter your opinion on the culpability of the German populace with respect to Nazi crimes. If the pilots had not been concerned about the negative side effects of their actions (they were), that is an important dimension that would have needed to be presented."

","The movie doesn't seem to have any bearing on what's going on right now. The whole thing revolved around creating these hardcore fighting machines, and then when they get their chance to kill, to ""perform"", they are forced to stop, thus, prevented from shooting their proverbial load. <br/><br/>Who can relate to this film in the current global climate? Soldiers are killed and see action over there. That's a reality going on TODAY. As a movie experience, it had it's moments and decent scenes, but overall it was boring. And the characters filled little more than a cliché mold - we had the troublemaker, the family man (Hispanic of course), the hard but wise sergeant, the troubled partner, and last but not least, the thoughtful white educated narrator leading us through it with slivers of wisdom and compassion. Man, didn't these guys see Platoon? Give me a break."

","OK Honestly I thought this movie was going to be about the Marine Unit that actually got attacked by Iraqi Forces during operation desert shield, not some light mortar fire. But it wasn't and I scratched my head and said how can you make a movie about Desert Storm with out using units that saw combat. I didn't get it. The start was cool all the way up to the ""fighting"" part. Three Kings was a good desert storm story with action and coolness, this movie was well, dull, I liked some it. To movie makers out there please read the script first and figure out what the movie can and cant do. I know it was based on a true story, but you don't make true stories that BLOW into movies that promise a lot on the previews. You want to see some ""true"" combat stories why don't you make some of the War now, my god there's more Rambo stuff going on in Afganistan and Iraq right now. I like the Directional flow of the film it touches on the softness of the Marines and what happens to Soldiers when they go over seas. I love the way the movie set up and it would have been soooo much better with a different story.

There was 1 killing but only in the training scene where the private couldn't get through the training and got live ammunition in the head! Sitting through the movie made me want to kill myself and make it over!! Waste of my $10.00 I'd recommend waiting for it to come out on DVD or the shifty black market! When they made a wall for the cheating wives and girlfriends of the army men its kind of accusing but they were having naked hot showers and lots of ""field fun"" apparently..

","I was lucky enough to see an advanced screening of this film. I had high expectations for this one, I have read articles by Anthony Swofford, the writer of the novel and person who Swoff is based on. I was left with mixed emotions after seeing it.It was good but it wasn't great. The acting is very strong on the part of Peter Asgard and Jake Gyllenhal and some of the parts are very powerful in my opinion, while other parts are brisked over like a certain training scene. There is heavy reference to other war films in this movie and while it strives to be modern and original its just another war film. there really isn't any innovative camera work and the story is very cliché on certain war related topics. It still gives a glimpse at how sometimes there's just nothing to do in the desert, but then again war is war and its hard to make something unique so there are similarities to the loss and gain of the war experience. The boot camp scenes and rifle references wreak of Kubrick and the viewing of war films in the movie kind of make them prerequisites to seeing this film. It definitely isn't the best war film but it is worth seeing."

","'Jarhead' is completely overrated. If you want to see this movie by all means go ahead, but if your looking for something better than the original war movies in the past then rent them. This movie actually takes scenes from the classic war films such as 'full metal jacket', 'platoon'. Straight scenes, exact copy, lines and everything. Even though the writer expresses that's how it happened during war times and wants to depict it as best as possible. I understand his reasoning but he needs to learn something, people don't want to pay money to see something they've already seen. A good war movie that will soon be a classic though in retrospect but a movie that is entirely overrated."
