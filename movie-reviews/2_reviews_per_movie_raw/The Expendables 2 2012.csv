"MR_Heraclius","6","38","41","23 February 2020"," I enjoyed this movie
","The early 90s version of an action movie - non stop gunfire and fights. One very good reason to watch this series is that any movie after this seems to be excellent. The only saving grace are some really old wisecracks from Jason Statham. Skip it, if you need to."
"Matt_Layden","8","237","339","13 August 2012"," Exactly what I wanted from the first film - The Avengers of action movies.
","While on a mission one of the ""Expendables"" gets himself killed, this leads the crew to go on a mission of revenge. But is it too much to handle? <br/><br/>I was severely disappointed in the first Expendable film, the mediocre action, the use of CGI blood and the unimpressive villain ruined the experience. So I was hoping that the second time around they would correct these issues. I can safely say, they did and they did it in spades. The big change is Stallone is no longer behind the camera, so he is more focused on his role of Barney and his mind isn't split between two separate places. The biggest change though is the tone, The Expendables 2 does not take itself seriously at all and neither did I, so I had a blast watching what is ultimately a parody of the action genre. <br/><br/>I can look past the acting, lack of story and plot because the film doesn't try to give you one. It's a simple film with a simple purpose. Get as many of these big guys into one film, make it a guys flick with lots of action and killing and they succeeded. The biggest misstep this film has is the motivation behind the revenge. The wrong person dies. A character is killed off that we have almost zero emotional connection with, it would have made more sense if it were another character that disappears early on in the film. It seems this character's sole purpose was to have these characters get their revenge on, which makes it less engaging for the viewer.<br/><br/>I was surprised at how underwhelmed I was by the action in the first film, here it is more stylized and fun. The film steps on the gas from the very beginning and almost never lets up. We are thrown into this action sequence at the start, which is better than anything the original had to offer. A more competent action director is behind the lens this time, Simon West who gave us Con Air and the more recent Mechanic. He understands what is needed and delivers some wild action sequences. <br/><br/>As I mentioned before, the film does not take itself seriously and it has a very tongue and cheek demeanour about it. It's not afraid to wink at the camera, specifically when Chuck Norris enters the screen and steals the show with the funniest line in the entire film. The film is full of one liners you would expect from an action film. During a fight, one characters exclaims, ""Let's wrap this up"" he then proceeds to take a chain and wrap it around another character's neck to choke him out. Another scene we have a bad guy get shot a dozen times by everyone and Stallone retorts, ""Rest in pieces"". Finally, my favourite, Stallone says ""heads up"" then proceeds to throw a head to some people. Yes, this movie is violent, so no fear about the PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>So what about the guys? Well, they all come back, some have a lot more to do than others. Lundgren is basically the comedic relief. Crews and Courture again get short shifted and feel like background characters. Schwarzenegger, Willis and Norris all have more in depth cameos and finally Van Damme shines as the villain. Van Damme really deserved more screen time. We are introduced to him, then we cut back every so often as he tries to steal his plutonium, then we have him fight at the end. He deserved more screen time, so did his right hand man, Scott Adkins. Both are more martial arts type fighters than big gun shooters and since this is a Stallone film, this is a big gun shooting movie. They get their fight sequences, but both of them I thought could have been a bit longer. Especially the Van Damme/Stallone fight.<br/><br/>So in the end, The Expendables did exactly what the first film should have done. It's a hilarious parody of the action genre and has non-stop excitement from start to finish. This is finally the film from these guys that I've been waiting for."
"caseyx","9","192","302","12 August 2012"," Great to see they're still here!
","I saw The Expendables II this morning at a pr√© screening. What can I tell you about this movie. Firstly, it's really action packed. You're blasted off in the first few minutes leading up to the actual story. Obviously, this is not a film with a great script or impressive acting.However, the story works well for what it's supposed to do! It is greatly entertaining if you are looking for an action packed movie loaded with iconic action stars like Stallone,Willis and many more. The addition of Chuck Norris and van Damme to the cast worked out well. It's really good to see Chuck Norris in action again and he really pulls it off! I expect that the people who will like this movie most will be the fans of the old guard like Stallone, Schwwarzennegger and Norris and the other cast members. Someone I really liked was Liam Hemsworth who did a great job and stood his own between these action giants! Nan Yu as Maggie was also a good casting choice an did what she was supposed to do.<br/><br/>Aside from the ""overdrive"" action the film also had a lot of humor, which gave some counterweight to the action.<br/><br/>I hope, but quite frankly expect this will do really well in cinema's globally. As a long time Sylvester Stallone fan I can only hope that he (and his family) will find the strenght to overcome the loss of his son.<br/><br/>To the people who are going to see this extravanganza, I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did!"
"tonystalloney","8","218","345","6 August 2012"," Better than the first by a mile
","First off, yes, much better than the first.... thank god, more locations, funnier and better put together.<br/><br/>No time from opening credits, its straight into the action, which is more epic imo, and is what should have been seen in the first film but maybe due to a low budget we were subjected to a lesser affair The team work well, all of them and Hemsworth does really well as the new boy on the block and second time round and you kind of know these guys. Arnie, bruce are seen more but are not seen as much as the usual gang, and li is seen the least.<br/><br/>Norris is great, seen here and there, great entrance and more of a cameo, and van damme makes good his role as the villain.<br/><br/>The story pretty much straight forward, better than the first, but nothing special, some dialogue was hard to hear, and sly does try to be serious in some scenes which got a laugh and I don't think its how it was intended but its not that much of a big deal really as there are funny moments in the film, more so than the first film.<br/><br/>Fight scenes were better this time round, not too prolonged, timed well, and the one on ones didn't drag on too long. Sly & van damme's fight could have been a bit longer but I guess after all the chaos leading up to that point it was sufficient enough without getting too silly, reminded me of a Rocky fight here and there....he he One liners were good, dolph was great, the girl is good also, be good to see her in exp3, locations and sets fab, cgi was not obvious and edited well.<br/><br/>One thing I will say is sly does have issues coming across as funny and I don't know why. He's funny in real life and was funny in rocky but its hit and miss and it shows here in some scenes.<br/><br/>Its not 10/10 in my book. Maybe when i see it again it may be better in my mind, but like i say a better story would of helped If there is a 3rd, I would like to see more of a story if that is at all possible, see what you think guys when its out, but it's a big improvement on the first and that's a good sign"
"dvc5159","6","83","125","17 August 2012"," Welcome back to the '80s
","It takes a certain mindset to appreciate a movie like ""The Expendables 2"". One has to be a fan of the action genre of the 1980s and early 1990s, as well as enjoying those action heroes' persona and screen presence whenever they appear on-screen. They did not necessarily have to act well, but they had to be tough, heroic, stoic, larger than life. Realism need not really apply here - it's all about the fun factor. People paid to see these guys blow away the scum of the earth as they only know how.<br/><br/>""The Expendables 2"" is the first sequel (and it most certainly would not be the last) to Stallone's 2010 surprise blockbuster which was intended as a glorious throwback to the films of that era. This one is no exception. However, it is a rare sequel which is better than the first. The story may not be important in these types of movies, but in this one the screenplay had a much clearer and stronger narrative than the first film, making it clear that the stakes are raised, thus enabling the story, however shallow, to be more engaging for the audience.<br/><br/>Director Simon West (""Con Air"") did wonders with the action sequences as he usually does with his movies. The majority of the action sequences are well shot with wide angles and much better stunt choreography (with CGI touches added here and there, but not as pervasive as the first film's CGI blood; good ol' squibs are used here mostly) which gets annoying with the film's rapid editing at times. Brian Tyler's music score was fairly engaging but didn't really stand out. Overall, the technical aspects of the film really shows off the big budget for the film, and it pays off ultimately.<br/><br/>But what about the characters? If you've seen the director's cut for the first film, that's about as close as you can get for character development. Like the first, this is all-out action, but it has some dramatic moments too. There is a line about coping with death that Barney Ross mutters that feels kind of sad knowing Stallone's own real- life predicament. Van Damme's having a blast as the Villain, and a menacing one at that. The biggest disappointment was that of Jet Li's very minimal screen presence, like a cameo. Hopefully an extended version will fix that problem.<br/><br/>The film's biggest entertainment value comes in the constant one-liners from and between the action icons of the eras, as well as their presence and their dispatching of the bad guys. The banter here is certainly more hilarious and less bland than the first film - there is much more chemistry between the characters. Their screen presence needs no explanation: Sylvester Stallone. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Bruce Willis. Jean-Claude Van Damme. Chuck Norris. Dolph Lundgren. Jason Statham. Jet Li. Need I say more? Cult or mainstream, these guys each has hordes of fans - and they have good reason to.<br/><br/>I grew up on these types of movies and ultimately ""The Expendables 2"" satisfies my craving for good old-fashioned movie bloodlust in wake of the ever-rising wave of PG-13, CGI-laden action films (""Total Recall"" remake, anyone? Oh Arnie, where art thou?). That being said, I expect an extended director's cut as I feel that some parts were awkwardly put together, and hopefully these removed scenes will make the film better as a whole. For now, ""The Expendables 2"" is very good entertainment, as shallow as it is technically well-made and ends the 2012 summer movie season with a big bang.<br/><br/>Now bring on ""The Expendables 3"" with Steven Seagal and Wesley Snipes (to basically complete the cycle of 80's/'90s action heroes). Mel Gibson, Kurt Russell, Harrison Ford, Nicolas Cage and Clint Eastwood (my #1 action hero) are also most welcome indeed.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 65%<br/><br/>Action movie rating: 75%"
"janus-20","10","178","284","18 August 2012"," ATTENTION, can somebody please claim the body of the pg-13 action movie, its dead, thank you.
","What we have here is an almost contemptuous lack of respect for property and human life. But, when that human life is vile, murderous, plutonium pilfering dirtballs, then its time chop, break, snap, blast, liquify, incinerate and decapitate (repeat).<br/><br/>There's very little point in going into a great deal of explanation of what makes this so worth a trip down to your local cinema. Suffice to say Sylvester Stallone has once again saved action movies and put the meat back on the bone. <br/><br/>Here he is aided and abetted by messrs Schwarzenegger, Willis, Norris, Van Damme, Statham, Li, Lundgren, Crews, Couture, who all dive into the proceedings with an enthusiastic amount of esprit de corps, taking the carnage to a hitherto undiscovered level. <br/><br/>This is an action movie with both feet planted firmly in the 80's and there nothing wrong with that one iota. The guys banter, crack jokes, shoot and cause things to blow up, the bad guys are hissable, murderous wretches to a man and are blown up.<br/><br/>Everybody is clearly having a blast, so in translation, so do you, of particular note, Jean Claude Van Damme provides a standout performance as sneery and arrogant Jean Villain.<br/><br/>If you like proper action movies i would be bewildered if you didn't enjoy this. Sly, you did it again, you are without a shadow of doubt ""the man"".<br/><br/>If they can deliver Eastwood, Ford, Cage, Snipes, Russell, Biehn, Weathers and T for the next one, then my money is already spent."
"omarh92","7","74","112","16 August 2012"," A reloaded *** kicker and better than the 1st one.
","I must admit, the hype for the first film was too much and in the end, we all got some intense 80s style action but with a poor story. This sequel however actually has a story, a story of revenge. The first film introduces the gang so we get to know them. The second however, we already know the gang so now we actually see how they truly are and how they work. This film is better since the rest of the team (other than Stallone) get more screen time and they have their humor moments. Van Dammne played a very very very very very AWESOME villain, and towards the end of the film, he shows even at the age of 50, he is stronger than ever. Arnie and Bruce Willis had a great screen time too with perfect humor, seriously the chemistry between those 2 and the rest is great. Speaking of chemistry, Dolph Lundgren's role is MUCH better now and very enjoyable. Chuck Norris, you'd be surprise how he is. The cast was great, the story is better, the action is MORE intense, there is great humor. In conclusion, Expendables 2 brings back the 1980s action style with it's teaspoon of humor. Enjoy the film!"
"troymartin93","2","99","154","2 September 2012"," What is this? I don't even...
","I don't care if I'm the minority here but seriously if anyone has ever seen a decent movie before then they would realize how ridiculous this film is. So much talent can be had from this cast as most of us have seen over the years. If the dialogue from this movie wasn't enough to deter me from liking it then it was the multiple references to previous action films starring the individual cast that did it. The addition of Liam Hemsworth playing billy the kid was a strong move considering his part was by far the most interesting and well portrayed. Better kill off the greatest part in the film (it was pretty evident and clich√© that Billy was going to die due to the fact that in every film where someone is about to leave or better themselves in some way leads to their death). Another thing that really bothered me about this film was the fact that Jason Statham's ""honey"" bothering him throughout the film had literally no relevance, yet they led the audience to believe it would.<br/><br/>The editing in this film was tragic... Ever since Stallone has been making a ""come back"" with action films, the animated blood that is featured is some of the most unrealistic i've seen. When I first witnessed this odd looking blood was in the most recent ""Rambo"". I thought then that it was interesting looking but eventually due to the excessive amount of it being used i grew tired. There is a scene in The Expendables 2 where they have cleared out a small church filled with Van Damme's cronies and only one enemy is left. They proceed to light this man up, (which i found comical) but once again the terrible editing in this scene ruined it. You can clearly see his entire torso covered in poorly edited bullet holes that don't even move with the mans body.<br/><br/>With a cast and crew like this, I'd think they'd be able to fund for some fantastic special effects. Thanks for the disappointment though."
"Aaron1375","9","96","152","22 August 2012"," The Expendables are back and stuff gets blown up! What else did you expect?
","I went to this film expecting another fun explosive ride and I got what I was expecting. Lots of explosions, plenty of bullets and numerous kills. I have to say I enjoyed this one a bit more than the last one, I am not sure what the critics were complaining about, but then they were harsh to Sylvester and Arnold's films back in the day too, so I guess I should not expect anything different this go around. And speaking of Arnold, it was great to see him back and part of the action this time. Probably one of the reasons I enjoyed this one a bit more than the second film.<br/><br/>The story has our gang going into some type of military type installation to retrieve a hostage right from the get go. Suffice to say, before the title comes across the screen you are exposed to lots of action and violence. Ah Sylvester, you sure know how to do it right. We get introduced to a new member of the team and sad to say we have to say goodbye to one of the older members. Granted he was not killed, but he does exit the film early and does not return. I could not believe he did not come back, and if I have a gripe about the film it is that this character did leave so early. Well Church (Bruce Willis) finds Barney (Stallone) and he wants a favor. He wants Barney to take his team to the site of a crash to retrieve something. Something that Van Damme wants and gets. Barney's group goes after this villain, not because of what was taken, but for revenge! The character's are expanded upon here a bit more. It was great seeing Dolph with the team for the entire film. He is still crazy, but he is a bit more under control and actually provides some very humorous moments. Arnold and Bruce are in this one a lot more than the previous film too. They get to take part in the action this time as their roles are not merely walk ons this time. Chuck Norris also gets to do his thing, just as he did back in the 70's and 80's. Van Damme was also in this one a good deal and he made a very good villain. He was much more memorable than the villains from the previous film, I mean Stone Cold was good at the fighting, but did not leave an impression on me as far as acting. Van Damme on the other hand played the part of a villain very well, this film may open up another avenue for him.<br/><br/>This film was fun for me. I am not suggesting it is a work of art or anything, but I missed the first film in the theaters, so I was not going to miss this one. I wanted to see this troupe of action stars shoot it up on the big screen and I got what I wanted to see. Arnold's return was particularly satisfying for me, as there has been a void in my movie theater life since he became governor. I want to see him on the big screen as he was a favorite of mine as a kid and young adult. I also enjoyed seeing Norris on the big screen for the first time in my life. I thank Stallone for bringing all the big guns to the table and while others may not have cared for this film...for me, it was a blast! So sorry if you do not care for my opinion, but I enjoyed this film."
"DICK STEEL","8","95","152","16 August 2012"," A Nutshell Review: The Expendables 2
","The mercenaries are back! And if the response from the box office is stellar, I suppose The Expendables can build upon a formula that's established through the two films to date, that somehow follows how James Bond would have done it, with its longevity inspiring similar treatment. There's the opening big bang action sequence, followed by Bruce Willis' shady CIA operative Mr Church coming on to provide Barney (Sylvester Stallone) and his team a challenge they cannot refuse (by way of blackmail). Technology and weapons go down to bare basics with loads of guns, knives and brass knuckles, with room for a female companion somewhere, against a mob boss played by somebody well known.<br/><br/>The Muscles from Brussels Jean-Claude Van Damme had agreed to step into the shoes of the villainous boss called erm, Villain, and shows he still got the moves with his signature roundhouse kicks. His plan is to make billions through mining weapons grade plutonium from a mine mapped out by the CIA, and together with lackey Hector (Scott Adkins), snarl in cocky fashion for the most parts, with Hector doing most of the dirty work of enslaving villagers to do their dirty bio-hazardous work. I guess egos got put aside when both got signed on to play villains amongst hundreds of faceless goons who are plain fodder when the Expendables come knocking, no thanks to a personal vendetta being set up early in the movie, giving Barney just cause for tracking, hunting, then killing.<br/><br/>Don't expect The Expendables sequel to be any brainier than the original of course, since nothing is cerebral here, and anything that exhibits a little bit of ingenuity, or brains, get mocked at. Just look at how Dolph Lundgren's Gunner Jensen got treated throughout as a mad scientist equivalent. It's really all about the bigger the guns, muscles and explosions, with the first scene establishing just how our heroes would plough through their adversaries - with ease like hot knife through butter. There's plenty of CG blood, gore, decapitations of various appendage done in a myriad of styles, they're all dumbed down to somewhat cartoony violence - where no matter what the faceless goons throw at The Expendables, nothing sticks, with vice versa accuracy the other way round. You may balk at scenes involving high caliber weapons literally ripping through a hole in someone's body or blowing up heads to smithereens, but it's the way the heroes become executioners, all without remorse.<br/><br/>Directing duties are given to Simon West, and in all honesty, he ensured a better way to shoot all the action, that is a leg up from how Stallone decided to do it, which was a blurry mash of clashing bodies in extreme closeups. Here we get to see who does what, with some incredible stunts filled with movie logic loopholes, you'd fare better if you leave your inhibitions at the door, and enjoy this action film for what it is. The screenplay by Richard Wenk and Stallone doesn't leave any room for character development, except for the continued buddy bromance between Barney and his right hand man Lee Christmas (Jason Statham). And their crew also got pared down with Jet Li appearing in just the first two scenes, with the team made up most of the time by Barney, Lee, Gunner, Hale (Terry Crews) and Toll (Randy Couture), with Yu Nan replacing Li as the token female and Chinese character who balances brains, guts and brawn.<br/><br/>What this outing now had, is plenty of jokes. It doesn't pretend to be what it's not, and junks seriousness, ever willing to trade in laughs at every opportunity. There are enough corny one liners here, and action set ups, that parody the action careers of Stallone, Willis and Schwarzenegger combined, the trio whom most audiences are really here to watch gracing the same screen together. And let's not forget good old Chuck Norris as Booker, with a tip of the hat going in the direction of the countless of Chuck Norris jokes that get a leg up when told by the legendary man himself, with his Booker having a reputation of being much of a lone wolf, coupled with a knack of appearing when needed, and given the abilities of all his action film roles combined.<br/><br/>The story centers on a vendetta to be settled between The Expendables and Villain, and being a personal one too, with a handful of emotional scenes for Stallone to flex his acting chops a little. In what would be an uncanny coincidence, Stallone himself had to battle personal loss during the promotional tour of this film with the passing of his son. Despite having his crew made up of veterans of action roles past, Stallone continues to show that he has a fun-filled, violent action franchise that's picking up traction, and has enough legs to warrant more films to come, especially when more names like Snipes and Eastwood have been bandied around as potential inclusions. Action fans, this is something that you won't want to miss, especially if you've grown up in the 80s and 90s!"
"tzrjustbrowsing","3","131","215","23 August 2012"," Pure garbage
","I have no idea why so many people like this movie, maybe I have high standards, but i have to say, all the characters in this movie just don't mix. You can't have all the characters the MAIN character and the story is just pure garbage.<br/><br/>The only bit I liked in this movies was the part where Chuck Norris flashes into the scene, other than that it's just a bundle of shooting and screaming and nothing else really.<br/><br/>The whole story didn't even have a feeling that something was happening. The plutonium was considered a piece of candy that was stolen and everyone was focused on being a 'badass'.<br/><br/>If all mercenaries would be crying babies like this guys, how will they ever survive a seeing a small puppy on the side of the road? In my opinion it's just pathetic.<br/><br/>At least the first movie had a topic, people were talking in their native language, here everyone knows English, no matter where they are from.<br/><br/>Truly I give up, since most of this actors are some of my favorite, but repeating old movie lines (I back, I'm coming back, You came back enough), just makes them look like clowns.<br/><br/>One good thing about this movie is that they did get the character of Jean-Claude Van Damme right. He is a true psycho, but they just found out this right now.<br/><br/>Other than this, the movies deserve a 3 star rating, and this is generous considering that the director of the movie just bashed all the characters head on raw concrete with his amazingly stupid script."
"scottedunlap","1","95","153","26 August 2012"," Quote from Billy Madison "" We are all dumber for having heard it!""
","The first thing that strikes me about this movie is, why does it look SO bad? Is it the feel or style they are going for? I dunno, it just looks bad. Maybe they are trying to Vaseline screen the aging stars, who are all in great shape by the way, or are they saving on film? Do they even use film anymore? SPOILER ALERT Virtually every action scene here is over the top and totally unbelievable except for a short scene with Jet Li. The initial escape scene makes NO SENSE! Sly gets shot while going down a seemingly infinite zip line? Statham's got his back so he stays behind while they are surround and the rest of the team continues the escape on the water high speed style. Out of nowhere Sly and Jason are rescued by fledgling team member snipers them out of the situation. Sly grunts ""Time for plan b"" back to the water chase. Jet skis, for no apparent reason appear from nowhere and the team abandons the boat. Just when all is lost, Stallone and Statham zoom overhead in the plane they arrived in. How is this plan b? Wouldn't the boats and jet ski's be plan b. Jet skis shoot into the ramp of the plane as the plane struggles get get enough lift to take off before they crash into a huge damn. Hey, since we are having trouble gaining altitude, let's head for the HIGHEST POINT on the dam! Most of the action scenes pretty much follow this level of nonsense. Oh well, maybe the writing is good? Nope! Back story for the newbie team member to make us care about him when he gets killed pretty much goes like this, ""So, how did you get into this line of work?"" "" I was in Afganistan for three years when my platoon got trapped in the oil zone. By the time we got out, four of my friends were dead. When I got back to base, they had shot the dog I was taking care of, so, I'd had enough killing for the day""! That's it? That's the best the writes of this mega budget could come up with? Also to the character, since you had enough killing you decided to become a mercenary where you would kill people all day! Speaking of death, I read a stunt man died making this POS. people die everyday, on the subway, in their sleep, lots o reasons, but honestly, I can't think of a bigger waste of life than to die for this movie."
"GOWBTW","9","106","180","18 August 2012"," Bring it on, BABY! Bring on the firepower and the mayhem. Keep it coming!
","This sequel did not disappoint! Maximum star power, maximum firepower, maximum excitement. ""The Expendables 2"" was a thrill ride that no one will ever forget. Sly is back with his crew once more, but this time they gain a new recruit: Bill the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) who's a top notched sniper, and Maggie (Yu Nan) who is smart but very gutsy in nature. They bring back all the ones who just had cameos in the first installment. It got more fun when they got Booker(Chuck Norris) "" The Lone Wolf"", and Jean-Claude Van Damme. There's one drawback, he's a villain. The action in the movie was totally non-stop, there was also a lot of humor, clich√©s, and one liners in the film. So long to list, I can't catch up if I tried. ""I''ll be back!"", is a classic. Sly and Van Damme? An unlikely battle in the making, however, it's a new epic battle anyone can think of. Dolph Lundgren was known for his intellectual talent back in the 80's. He really put it into good use here. If you thought the first movie was something, you haven't seen anything like this. ""The Expendables 2"" is a must see movie for years to come. All star action, all star humor, and just enough adrenaline to keep you alert at all times. Enjoy this movie! 4.5 out of 5 stars."

","This is easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen. If you want to see 3000 people shot to death then you will love this movie. I saw this in an IMAX, but that didn't make the movie less painful. The story is the same old one, good partner gets killed the teams takes revenge. The first 15 minutes was bearable. There was nothing but mindless killing. Every scene is unrealistic and there is absolutely no story line. The good guys can apparently stand and shoot 1000 people face on face and bad guys will miss them. 5 guys shooting and killing 100 people in a open room without getting hit, is what best describes the movie. And finally stallone defeats the villain in fist fight. Oh he had a gun but u know fist fights are better. This is worse than any bad Indian movie i have ever seen. Most Indian superhero movies are much better than this movie. <br/><br/>In short if you have watched any action movie, don't go to this movie."

"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","7","12","16","26 August 2012"," The Expendables 2 (2012)
","The Expendables 2 is the ultimate fan service and gives us even more than we got for the first installment. The Expendables 2 sees Barney Ross and his team having to pay back Mr. Church by going on a simple mission of retrieving an item from a downed plane. All goes well until Jean Claude Damme shows up. Van Damme is an excellent villain. He is clearly having a lot of fun and looks damn cool at the same time. The film just builds up to action set-pieces and cameos that don't always make a lot of sense, but are much appreciated. With so much going on, not everyone gets their due. Li has to leave early on to make some room, and Crews and Couture are sidelined for more A-List stars for the finale. The final action sequence what you paid your money for. Stallone, Willis, Lundgren, Norris, Schwarzenegger and Van Damme all taking part in a single action scene. It's great to finally see it but it does go too much towards comedy as the characters trade their famous catchphrases. The film has delivered on its promise even if there is a distinct lull in the second act where the dialogue is cringe worthy and it tries too hard to develop characters we don't really care about. I am now very excited for Stallone and Schwarzenegger's next projects and The Expendables 3."

","This movie fails in almost everything that is there to fail. Nothing that can thought as original as everything is big mash up served to upset people. When there are too many heroes it does not mean there cannot be any co-ordinated team work. They wasted lot of film just to give entry. The story is very predictable and pretty much compromised for some petty bloody action sequences. People who might have given such high ratings would have fallen victim for the cheesy dialogs and the reminiscence of the old movie dialogs.Compared to the first movie this movie villains are duds and heroes are more or less bloody comedians.In one word this movie can never be called as action movie. It is like a parody.I only wish if they have modified the story with some original dialogs with interesting plot and a notorious evil genius as villain who treats everyone as expendables to reach his vision to be stopped by this rag bag team of mercenaries. But this was just bang,boom,slash where only heroes weapons are activated and villains are merely target practice. Even if you want to salute these old heroic actors don't waste your money on this one it will simply make them worthless. However all the above is only my opinion."
"WinstonNoCGI","3","81","142","2 September 2012"," A craftsmen's disaster (awful score, rigging, camera, editing, story)
","Expendables 2 tries to step into the big shoes of Expendables 1 but fails disappointingly.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie the viewer gets the impression of watching a Greek tragedy, but not an action movie.<br/><br/>~~ Musical Score ~~<br/><br/>The musical score confines to strings playing slow arrangements. At a few, random(!) occasions, playing staccato lines, but still it's not ""Action"" music.<br/><br/>This musical score lacks brass, snare drum, timpani. It's lacking hard, military, score parts.<br/><br/>I remember better musical scores, like Predator, Rambo: First Blood Part II, The Wild Geese, Mission Impossible TV show.<br/><br/>Where's Alan Silvestry? Lalo Schifrin? Composers like (unfortunately deceased) Jerry Goldsmith or Maurice Jarre? Don't they belong to a movie like the Expandables like any of the actors?<br/><br/>~~ Sound Effects ~~<br/><br/>The only sound effects to appreciate have been the heroes' guns. No other extraordinary efforts in creating sound effects have been taken.<br/><br/>This comes along with camera/editing, lacking a view for details.<br/><br/>You never hear (or see) gloves grate when tightened. You never hear (or see) snap fasteners click when closing a knife's holster.<br/><br/>You never ""hear"" silence. - Back in the 80's, limiters were used to increase the impact of sound of a movie. Their use had been exaggerated so the the viewer was able to hear crackles when no-one talked. These were the most exciting moments because the viewer actually had the impression of adrenaline kicking through his own veins, which would have resulted in the same effect. The viewer could virtually hear a needle fall on the floor. Expendables 2 is missing both: Silence (and thereby suspense) and a limiter device.<br/><br/>~~ Rigging and Color Timing ~~<br/><br/>The whole movie is tainted blue. It's lacking pristine colours. The viewer feels more like watching Sleepy Hollow or Blade than watching an action Movie.<br/><br/>But for the worst: While the lighting people put lights on the stage, they missed to put light on the actors' faces! The actors mostly are just black blurry shadows acting in front of the camera!<br/><br/>Moreover, the movie is missing highlights. The only highlight I could actually see was the sun shining through the airplane's windows. But that's all. Lighting technicians must have been on strike while making this movie.<br/><br/>~~ Camera and editing ~~<br/><br/>Camera end final cut are awful.<br/><br/>The camera did not focus on details at all. You never see macro close-ups, e.g. showing a hand either tightening a glove or clasping a knife in the holster. You never see someone's eyes focusing on anything.<br/><br/>This becomes particular annoying during action scenes: Every actor is almost immediately shooting around. There's not a single arming/preparing sequence in the move.<br/><br/>The camera never follows a flying knife, or any other of the rare non-shotgun weapons, on its way.<br/><br/>The whole cut is always either hasty or boring. Anyway. it's rendering many potentially relevant scenes irrelevant.<br/><br/>~~ Story telling ~~<br/><br/>This flick is a patchwork of about a dozen common-or-garden stories, each told within 5 minutes, and none of them adds value to the movie.<br/><br/>There is not a moment of suspense in the movie. What happens on the screen is either boredom (like the actors waiting for night to come) or immediate action. The viewer never is ahead (or behind) of the actors' knowledge.<br/><br/>The jokes don't bring relief to a suspenseful moment. They are mostly referring to the age of the actors.<br/><br/>I don't like being reminded of being too old when watching an action flick with my old heroes. I want them to surprise me. I want them to show me what they can still do! Either join the action as a hero or stay out of it.<br/><br/>I'm missing the funny chats, the ambiguity between brave heart killers and sentient men, like the Lee/Stallone dialog in part 1. Or the Mickey Rourke scenes from part 1. The coffee/spaghetti cooking scene is funny though.<br/><br/>The whole story is missing detail and suspense. The villain never becomes a personal menace. His/their killing is performed without any reason. But a villain does not become a menace from just killing people at random.<br/><br/>Most character dialogs or monologues are bullshit. Few jokes are funny. Most of them aren't, particularly when they are making fun of the heroes' previous characters.<br/><br/>~~ All in all ~~<br/><br/>The flick is technically bad done.<br/><br/>I have had the impression of taking part in a video game, but not of watching a Rambo style quality action movie.<br/><br/>I've been missing soundness in the characters' portrayal.<br/><br/>I've been missing suspense, in story, sound and musical score.<br/><br/>There have been too many heroes in the movie. None of them got enough time to fill his role. Less would have been more.<br/><br/>I loved how Thomas Danneberg managed to German-dub both, Silvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/>My conclusion: The second part of a series always is bad. Seems to be a mathematical law, waiting to be cracked yet.<br/><br/>However, I'm very much looking forward to a third (better) part!"

","Now I enjoyed the original Expendables for what it was but I was felt disappointed in the outcome because of the way it was hyped up and I felt a lot of things could have made it better, and that things were missing. Now years later, watching the Expendables 2 and not having as such high expectations I went into the film excited and thrilled for surprises. I also did not read any reviews or check critics ratings upon watching. I found this to be greater than the original for many reasons. The plot was more focused, the characters were more detailed (we got to like them more), and mainly because of the more well directed intense action scenes.<br/><br/>The film is separated into two parts. The first 45 or so minutes showing their plans on where to go. Focusing on Billy (Liam Hemsworth), and roughly the second half of the film is of course where we see his departure. Maggie steps in and takes a major role. I found both parts solid, yet the second half more interesting simply because we see the characters mesh more, and Arnold, Willis, and Chuck Noris get larger roles providing well in dept action and fight scenes.<br/><br/>This is one of those few exceptions where the sequel is better than the original. The Expendables was quite serviceable in my opinion, but it never really lived up to the potential of what could have been with the dream team cast it touted. This time however The Expendables take on a whole new attitude. The violence is more non stop and well delivered by the camera shots, there are more fight scenes, shootouts and the final battle fight between Stallone and Van Damme. However one thing I could have done with out is the several references to past 80's action films (Arnold saying ""I'm back!/ Yippie- Ki-yay/Who's next-- Rambo!"", etc). Mainly because his delivery was flat. Other than that, the Expendables 2 is a solid action thrilled popcorn film and delivers for its time being. We will see how the Expendables 3 turns out!"

I felt I am watching a pirated movie!<br/><br/>Now come to the movie. The movie has some good but boring GUN action, but don't know why I didn't like the movie much. Story was very flat (in fact no story). Arnold, Bruce, Jet Li and Chuck have a very less screen appearance. Sly and Jason are the main leads. Even the 'villain' Van Damme has also a weak part which could have been much much better, because there was a lot scope to his character. The biggest problem with the movie is a very weak story and a very less duration as compared to the characters in the film. I was very much positive about the role of Arnold but he got very less time on the screen. He must be given chance to show some muscular action, although he is aged now but with Arnold, expectations rise automatically. Sly should have opted Rajnikant instead of Chuck Norris :p All in all, Expendebles-2 is a weak film even it has hell amount of the action heroes. With said that, I really liked ""The A Team"" in this genre. I watched The A Team 2 years ago. The A Team is like Expendables but the treatment of The A Team was far far superior. It had some story, twists and some very nice action. I would still recommend you watch ""The A Team"". It is far better than Expendables-2.

"adhipar","4","9","12","2 October 2012"," Lower your expectation, almost become a B-movie action parody
","After watching the 1st expendables, I have a mixed but positive feeling about the series. Seeing these heroes from my past doing actions altogether is kind of reliving and refreshing their hypes and legends. I can say The Expendables is a good action movie and while it satisfies me in a certain level (not to the max), it delivers and makes me hungry for more, at least a trilogy.<br/><br/>So I came to theater with high expectation and sadly, the Expendables 2 is quite a disappointment for me. Somehow, it feels like a B-movie action comedy parody. Some scenes are suppose to be awesome but turn into cheesy ones instead. For example, when Van Damme killed one of the good guys, he made Adkins hold a dagger in front of that guy chest and then doing a turning kick........So? do we supposed to see it in disbelief or say ""Wow?"" <br/><br/>When Sly's (almost) full team is ambushed and cornered, someone secretly helped them by wipe out all their enemies, blowing up a tank/heavy artillery in just seconds, and then he (an action legend) show up (famous whistle from cowboy movies plays in background) while Sly's said ""Don't freak...don't freak"" - carrying only a semi automatic rifle..(???) I admit it's a funny scenes but quite a parody. Then, almost in the end of the movie, all of those action legend are showing up - I know they're up to something - and yes, everyone of them get a healthy dose of shooting weapons and killing enemies. Those poor bad dudes are nowhere to be found in the previous part of the film and probably are there in the last part so everyone in good guy team can contribute about 50 kills/each.<br/><br/>I'm expecting more duel than Expendables, but in here, there are only two duel and one of them is not worth to mention, I look for more hand to hand combat than the 1st series which both side are hurt, torn apart but in the same time they grow respect for each other skills. But it's just a plain nasty bad guys vs cool hero stuff, both throwing bullets I expect...well a lot of things but undelivered except seeing those legends and remembering how they have entertained me in the past. And I don't think I'll be excited for the 3rd installment now. And strangely, Jet Lee give better impact on me in his limited screen time than that Chinese girl who replaces him throughout the film.<br/><br/>So, if you want to watch this and still enjoy it, you should lowered your expectation.

","I'm giving this eight stars mostly because I like seeing the action heroes of my youth together in one film. I sorely missed Mickey Rourke though, who I thought was great in the first film. There has been a trend in the last decade or two of making movies with pretty but petite heroines who blow away all opponents. Kate Beckinsale in the ""Underworld"" series comes to mind here. It seems utterly ridiculous to expect a woman weighing perhaps 100 lbs to defeat well-armed men who are 200 plus pounds. This movie gave me the same feeling but for the reason that the heroes were old men, some of whom probably have trouble getting through a round of golf while using a golf cart. I wonder how long they can keep this up and still attract movie goers."

"TheSquiss","2","22","35","25 August 2012"," NO! Don't do it. Go and wash your mouth out.
","It's been a poor cinema month for me. Not that everything I've seen has been bad, more that I've seen very few films this August. And it pains me that one of those was The Expendables 2.<br/><br/>Oh, man. It's bad. Really bad. Not bad in an Extremely Close and Incredibly Loud kind of way, just in a Space Cowboys bunch-of-old-farts-acting-badly kind of way. <br/><br/>If you enjoyed First Blood, don't bother. It's not that good. If you thought Act of Valor was wonderful, then go and see The Expendables 2. You'll deserve everything you get. <br/><br/>So let's start with the good points (this is going to be quick):<br/><br/>1. Chuck Norris, despite being born in 1940 and the oldest on screen, looks younger and in considerably better shape than Schwarzenegger and Stallone. 2. Bruce Willis almost escapes with his dignity intact. 3. It eventually ends (after a long, painful 103 minutes).<br/><br/>And the pick of the bad points?<br/><br/>Oh, there are too many to mention. It's a black hole, into which reason, quality, acting ability, enjoyment, logic, and self-respect are sucked, never to return.<br/><br/>Mostly the actors, and once again this term must be used loosely, are unable to move and speak simultaneously and the vast majority of lines are caped at five words. I'm guessing brains are fried and most of those on the screen need idiot boards as well as reading glasses. It's hammed up pretty much all the time.<br/><br/>There isn't a single performance worthy of mention other than to say that Willis isn't as dreadful as the others. Usually in a macho gun-fest like this, one can rely on the 'intelligent girl' guest actor to provide something resembling a performance but in this instance Nan Yu falls some distance short of Jason Statham, the untrained, mono-expressive former cab driver.<br/><br/>Every possible 'in-joke' and reference to each star's signature roles is explored, repeated, repeated, repeated and nailed to the set for all to see, just in case they missed it the first few times. Exactly how many times can Arnie be back in one film? Yippee ki yay mother¬Ö<br/><br/>For the first few scenes, any of the audience that isn't dribbling and looking for their other brain cell smiles and hopes that the appalling lack of cohesion and intelligible dialogue is the sly wink and a nudge from director Simon West before he takes the job seriously. It isn't, he doesn't and it doesn't look as though he's capable of doing so. The Expendables 2 is a very, very long and steep decline from the glory days of his first two outings, Con Air and The General's Daughter. What West has given the world in The Expendables 2 is a series of explosions, grunts, expletives and camera moves dressed up as scenes that frequently don't flow or link in any traditional way. It just doesn't make sense. At times, the vocal expression is at odds with the words spoken and completely off-kilter despite following on from another line by the same actor! Did they have month-long breaks between set-ups? Did somebody forget to employ continuity?<br/><br/>I'm in danger of ranting and it really isn't worth the effort but I do have one question: What the hell is Chuck Morris doing arriving on screen to Clint Eastwood's The Good, The Bad and The Ugly theme??? It couldn't be any more sacrilegious to dress a statue of Mother Theresa in a basque and suspenders. Well, maybe a little, but you get my drift.<br/><br/>If you see this, it serves you right. <br/><br/>Needless to say, it wasn't my choice to see The Expendables 2, and now I need to clean my brain with a good book.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk<br/><br/>Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG"

","I don't know whether it was because the last film I saw before ExpII was The Dark Knight Rises, but I have to say this movie was a let-down. Actually, I'd go a step further and say I couldn't take it seriously and wanted to leave the theater on a number of occasions. I don't have particularly high standards for films in general and I'm usually quite good at enjoying them for what they are, but this one fell flat on all fronts for me.<br/><br/>It really didn't have much going for it from the start. The lack of plot development was astonishingly stark, even for the guns-blazing action flick this is. I haven't seen the first Expendables film, and maybe that's why I left this one with basically no recollection of the main characters' names, histories or motives. The film runs through without actually revealing much about any of the protagonists. It makes it difficult to really care about what they're doing.<br/><br/>The acting was also sub-par, but I wouldn't place blame on the actors, rather the clich√©-ridden script that didn't give them much to work with. A lot of the comedy is tired, and I have to say the racial stereotypes were overplayed. The female lead was dry and uninteresting, and the film practically builds up a romance that ends before it even begins.<br/><br/>Listen, I get the template for these kinds of films: the good guys are doing their thing when somebody wrongs them. Bring out the guns and the pace picks up. Then it's time for something sad to happen, leading to a point of emotional revelation in the film. Cue the epic soundtrack that's a little too reminiscent of that last summer blockbuster you saw, but whose name you just can't seem to recall at the time. Finally, we get some more ass-kicking and a final showdown with the big baddie. Sprinkle a multitude of one-liners and puns throughout the script, and there you have it, an action flick. The problem is that ExpII followed this little template to the dot, just not as well as that other flick playing in the next theater over.<br/><br/>Only watch if you're a big fan of the leads. Otherwise, wait for DVD."

A waste of time is about the kindest thing you can say about this. The first installment was over the top but it had some great action sequences and a storyline that was not completely ridicules. This however might as well have been one massive explosion from start to end, but apparently that's what people like nowadays - Do not worry about acting performance or even a slightly plausible storyline, do not even worry about crappy camera work or stupid cgi and lighting effects as long as you blow up enough stuff and splatter enough heads....."

","I am 35 years old, a rather early age, but today when i saw a transport aircraft successfully land inside a mine, i can confidently say- Dear God, I have seen it all. I have seen the hammiest group of currently senior citizen actors in the history of moviedom to get together for a sequel of an already poor film to deliver something worse. Sylvester Stallone and his gang of bulletproof mercenaries with a fondness for taking on medium sized foreign armies are back again in The Expendables 2, and the only good thing in the flick is the concept.<br/><br/>Like its predecessor, Expendables 2 is a 80s action flick starring grizzled veterans of that era- the idea of seeing these ageing guys who just don't want to take their retirement benefits is better off as a concept only, than any actual movie. True, the mere thought of Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis and Norris firing away to glory in the SAME frame is stuff of wet dreams for most action fanboys- but only in concept, in dreams- in reality, when these 60+ fellas strut their stuff now, more than the body count, the profound thoughts that float in and out of the mind are mostly around who has done the better skin-lift, or who has the best hairdo, or the most effective botox shots or even the best body double.<br/><br/>For the records, there is a plot- and it is as clich√©d as any action movie goes. As the first mission, the expendables put down a militia somewhere in the world, and the second mission gets personal- a team member gets killed and plutonium gets stolen, and all is left to our heroes to save the world, in addition to taking revenge. The really old gang of Stallone, Jet Li, Jason Statham, Randy Couture, Terry Crews, and Dolph Lungdren are joined by new mate Liam Hemsworth and ""combat proficient"" Yu Nan. Willis, and Schwarzenegger do more than just talk this time round, and are joined by another veteran who went ""missing in action"" in the 80s ‚Äì Chuck Norris. Keep it simple seems to be the mantra here- in reverence to their age, the Expendables fashionably hang out at a bar called The Old Point, even their transport aircraft is WW2 vintage, and the villain of this set piece, Jean Claude Van Damme is cleverly named Villain, too. Stallone looks like a genetic experiment gone hideously wrong and his old age must be the reason he doesn't see Yu Nang batting eyelids at him throughout. These ""has beens"" speak exclusively in punchlines from their older movies. And when Stallone goes philosophical (""Why is it the ones who deserve to die keep on living?"") and Dolph Lungren is the film's comic relief, you got to fear for your sanity. Quite late in the movie though- Arnold unintentionally utters the sole truthful line in the movie- "" We all belong to a museum"". <br/><br/>The Expendables begin with a normally over the top rescue mission in Nepal where they blow up seemingly, the entire Nepalese army, to smithereens. There is a ropeway shootout, a speedboat chase and armoured truck race lasting all about 15 minutes, and all culminating in the opening credits. This is the point where if we are in a mall, it would be the best time to actually step out, do some shopping, eat a bit, look at beautiful women- do something useful, because the next hour is perhaps the most boring hour in the history of action movies, and that includes all the solo actioners these guys have ever featured. You could make your way back in time for the even more over the top climactic 15 minutes, and my take is you would have probably seen the entire action director Simon West has got in store for you in this movie, which though is deliciously graphic, but falls short both in quantity and quality. True, heads gets splattered, limbs get decapitated, there are creative knife throwing sequences, lots of things eventually explode, van Damme roundhouses, Arnold and Willis do manage to fit into a SmartCar, and the heroes cheerfully grin and chomp cigars nonchalantly gunning down thousands, but nothing is memorable. Even the final bare knuckle fistfight between Stallone and Van Damme is an insult to memories of Rocky, Rambo and Bloodsport- they talk more than they fight and in that they resemble my kind- the civilized Bengali (ever seen Bongs fight?). <br/><br/>Jokes apart It probably hurts me more than anyone else because am a big time action fan and the 80s spawned some of the most unabashed movies in that genre. But with due respect, the last thing i wanted was memories of my childhood getting sullied by the atrocities of actors who still do not know their time is up.<br/><br/>Well then, its a travesty all right, and definitely not recommended. There is precious little of action, intelligence, wit and all things good that we expect out of a movie, and i am genuinely surprised at the positive opinions this movie has gathered till date. According to me Expendables 2 is forgettable, and sadly so -5/10"
"adam_evans14","Null","3","3","4 May 2013"," If you didn't like, well what did you expect?
","So with the release of the Expendables we witnessed a film that possibly can't be repeated in terms of scale. The reason lies with the over the top preoccupation with 'the action flick' in the 80's. So in bringing all these iconic figures of the action genre together the expendables evokes nostalgia among the older audiences while the ignorant can claim they want to see the new Jason Statham film.<br/><br/>Indeed my study of film on an academic level has led me to be called a snob somewhat. But, i'm the first to admit i enjoy a tongue in cheek film if it claims not to be anything other. When watching the film I know for a fact that it's written purely for entertainment purposes and nothing else. A popcorn movie. Any critical acclaim would be ludicrous. The films (both this and the first one) openly mock the ridiculousness of the 80's action flicks with outrageous shootouts and a collection of more testosterone than a sperm bank. If Stallone had sat down and claimed the expendables was the best script he's collaborated on one could only assume he's been taking the Spielberg tablets of Indy 4 (note; why i hate films like Indy 4 and Die Hard 4....they're supposed to be more serious whereas expendables you have to take it with a pinch of salt for what it is).<br/><br/>One thing that did get on my nerves though was perhaps the scenes involving Arnie. The references to Terminator with the uttering of 'i'll be back' brought a smile at best the first time; but to murder it time and time again at every opportunity got a bit annoying, and ultimately i ended up wishing he'd get shot for it. Considering Arnie was possibly the most famous of the action hero's of the 80's (along with Stallone...take your pick, it's between them two no doubt) i'd have liked to have seen him involved in the film properly and not just for comedic purposes.<br/><br/>Also he really looks long in the tooth compared with Stallone who's anti ageing cream could probably rake in more than the gross of Rocky. He's a tank and fair play to him, he looks amazingly good for his age.<br/><br/>Should they make an expendables 3? Probably not. I think people would get a bit bored of the chedderness of it, and besides the charm of nostalgia will have worn off by then. However if they did go ahead, i certainly won't protest and it would be interesting to have the full set with the inclusion of Steven Seagal. All in all, if you like dumb action flicks, this will do nicely. But don't tune in expecting an ambiguous and thought provoking film, and be disappointed when you don't get one. If you are then for shame."

","Where to begin? Well, the acting was okay. Just okay. Aside from Jason Statham who is above-average acting talent, everyone else was sub-par or well below average. The addition of the random Oriental actress didn't help this movie's cause. Aside from that, everything was predictable and the facial expressions and everything else that goes along with acting was pretty atrocious.¬†<br/><br/>The plot was lacking substance and purpose. A clear revenge story with no end, it seemed to drag on and add fuel to the fire in all the unnecessary and sometimes necessary, although predictable, ways. The violence factor was through the rough, which offended me as a portion of the audience. It was as if the director (if this movie even had one) didn't hold the movie-goer to a high enough standard and threw in as much and blood and violence as possible. Maybe to distract the audience from the limitless holes in the plot.¬†<br/><br/>As well as including pointless sections of wasted film into this movie, there are so many stupid and absolutely ridiculous corny jokes. As if the director had a hard-on for every Schwarznegger film ever made and decided to include every piece of cinephile-ific reference into the cracks of this movie.¬†<br/><br/>I don't know what more to say.

"IgiS","5","14","22","28 August 2012"," WARNING! This is not really a movie!!!
","As well as the first one, this is walking, shooting, crackling jokes tribute to those guys instead of the real action flick(if we can generally call action flick ""real""). This is my biggest problem with this franchise. We always wanted to see those guys together, no question about it, but here they are not playing any characters at all. Arnold is no Trench. Who is Trench? Who is Church? Those are Arnold in Hawaiian t shirt and Bruce. And what they did to Dolph Lundgren in this movie for crying out loud? He acts like a character from bugs bunny cartoon in this film. <br/><br/>Even Sly's and Statham's parts aren't shaped in any distinctive way, they just have more lines to deliver. <br/><br/>As for people like Crews, Couture and Li, they are barely in the picture at all. And lets not even mention Norris. <br/><br/>I remember when I saw Li in Lethal Weapon 4 in cinema back in 98'. Now THAT was fun movie, and great villain by the way. <br/><br/>I don't mind a movie to be simple plot-wise, Rocky 4 was also simple plot-wise, but Stallone PLAYED Rocky, and Lundgren PLAYED Drago, those were specific characters, and not Sly with mustache and Dolph acting like a crazy version of himself(with endless reference to him really having Masters Degree in chemical engineering). <br/><br/>Only Van Damme is playing some coherent part here, and we don't just feel that Van Damme is in the movie as Van Damme rather we see a new bad guy, and that is good. But even here, again, script is so poor in terms of any character development that we really don't know him very much also. Van Damme himself presented his part in many interviews as a guy who is crazy, will not be stopped by anyone etc etc. but we don't feel/see it in a movie, his part is simply too short. Yet he was the best thing in this. <br/><br/>What I liked is this nostalgia factor about those older famous guys, but this feeling took over whole flick, and that's why it wasn't really exciting. <br/><br/>Too bad, I really like those guys."

","I wanna thank Sly for his hard work at keeping the 80s action alive. You can tell he has put his whole heart into this project. And this time he really has EVERYONE on board. Not an easy task.<br/><br/>The cast is great. Arnold, Couture, Chuck Norris and Van Damme are hilarious. Dolph Lundgren is awesome too, and he proves that he actually can act. Statham is great as an angry British mercenary. Sly is wearing different clothes in every scene and i think he is also wearing a wig. He is macho, with make-up and rude to the ladies. He is way too serious in this movie.<br/><br/>The action is WAY BETTER than in Expendables Pt 1. You can now understand what is going on, who is where (no shaky cam). <br/><br/>The plot is ridiculous and i'm fine with that. <br/><br/>What bothers me is the senseless violence in Expendables 2. It's just shocking. It is not cool, Commando-type funny violence. It is pure gore, ugly and disturbing. Totally unnecessary. There is no explanation who is the enemy. Or what are they fighting for? The Expendables shows no respect for human life. It is all a shoot-them-up video game. <br/><br/>I cannot recommend this movie to anyone under 18."
"david-martial-artist","8","9","13","26 August 2012"," Depends on your expectation, I was delighted to watch it.
","First of all it should be noted that the way you see this movie depends on your expectations. People who say it was an awful movie, plot less, only mindless action, bad acting and things like this, may have expected a ""Se7en"" from ""The Expendables 2"" !!! That would be quite wrong. You should watch it as an ""ACTION"" movie, the name explains everything.<br/><br/>well, Let's start with the story. It's almost the same as the first one. At the beginning we see the expendables on a mission that lays the background for the movie. Then They receive a job offer from Mr. Church and at the end, they complete this mission (sounds like the first one, huh? Just their mission is different here). A good story for an action movie like this.<br/><br/>Acting is good here. I specially liked Statham's acting. He's really deep into his character. Others like Van Damme and Adkins are good too.<br/><br/>And the Action scenes: Well, after beginning to watch this movie with a friend, we began laughing after 15minutes, because all is killing and nothing else. Most fights are using gun in this movie (or Mindless Action as some people like to call it). There are also some hand-to-hand fights throughout the movie, all fairly well-choreographed.<br/><br/>And the two Climax fights: The fight between Adkins and Statham could be better, they both have great talents, not displayed superbly in this fight. and the second fight, between Our Old Frankie and Mr. Rambo: It was a great fight, some reviewers say that it was too short, but it wasn't. It was long enough and well choreographed (and I guess you know who as the winner?).<br/><br/>Others like Arnie, Willis, and Norris were good in their fairly short screen time.<br/><br/>All in all, It was a dream come true to see our old action heroes like Arnie, Stallone, Van damme, Willis, etc. together with younger ones like Jet Li, Adkins and Statham in one movie.<br/><br/>A very fun movie to watch. My Score: 8/10"
"pinball1984","5","19","32","17 August 2012"," Horrible. You are paying to see Stallone's inflated ego
","Movie was centered around Stallone, who happened to be a screen writer as well. The character distribution time was unevenly divided. No character development......none. Characters conveniently appeared when the horrible director best saw fit, but gave no justification or reasoning on how that character arrived at the scene. Cinematography might as well be compared to movies shot in the 80's.<br/><br/>Statham was excellent, but given limited time. Arnold's catch phrases became repetitive. Where the heck was Jet Li? If you like guys with guns (most mindless people do) and killing then this movie is for you; keep in mind all the action looks fake.<br/><br/>Reminds me of Indian movies where crazy scenarios and sequences are taking place, yet you just shake your head (no pun intended) because you know it's an Indian movie.<br/><br/>I have more to say but it's not worth my time, so I leave you with the moral of the story. If the main star of the movie happens to be a screenwriter, producer, or director.... the movie will be centered around them and take away from the quality of the movie. Thank You Tom Cruise (MI4) for allowing Stallone to have confidence in making this trash again .<br/><br/>PS....Seeing Stallone run was horrific."
"rjvickers","9","23","41","16 August 2012"," Action Cinema At Its Best
","From start to finish, The Expendables 2 was a fun ride and my eyes were glued to the screen. After reading all the reviews online about how there wasn't much of a story, and thus going in with very low expectations plot-wise, I was pleasantly surprised at how good the story actually was. It's nothing that's going to win Best Original Screenplay or anything, but it was solid and kept me interested. The dialogue was a vast improvement over EX1, which contained a lot of hit-or-miss lines that were at times cringe-worthy (though the director's cut fixed some of this in my opinion).<br/><br/>In fact, EVERYTHING was a vast improvement over EX1. The story, the chemistry of the cast, the cinematography, the pacing, and of course ‚Äì the action. Simon West did a good job with this (even though I suspect that Stallone did a great deal of ghost-directing and I'd be willing to bet money on it), and I want him to stay for EX3. We get to see plenty of Dolph this time around and Couture seemed a lot more comfortable than he did in the first movie. It's true that Jet Li is barely in the movie, but while he's on screen he's very fun to watch. After he leaves, you don't really miss him though. The opening action sequence was very fun, but I wouldn't really compare it to the climax of Rambo IV like some have, although I see their reasoning. Simply put: EX2 is its own beast.<br/><br/>Hemsworth didn't bother me nearly as much as I thought he would, and Sly gave a much better performance than he did in the first movie. JCVD was a great villain! Adkins was good as his sidekick, and I was very pleased that he didn't get the Gary Daniels Treatment from EX1. He doesn't have a ton of screen time, but he does the best with what he has. The same can be said about Arnie, Bruce, and Chuck. They're all basically just glorified cameos, but on every frame that they have ‚Äì they shine. Chuck fits into the film a bit better than I expected him to and although Arnie does indeed look old, it kind of enhances him. Think of Clint Eastwood, and how he seems to become even more bad-ass as he grows older. The same is true for Arnold; the wrinkles work in his favor. So I can confidently say that ARNOLD IS BACK!<br/><br/>The violence in this film definitely earned its R rating, and I think this board will be more than satisfied with it. There is a good mix of CGI blood and squib-work, which I think is the best we can ask for in this day and age. I will say that the CGI blood looks a lot better than it did in the first movie. In EX1 the CGI blood was distracting and looked amateurish. In EX2 it actually looks professional. The beginning of the movie leans more on CGI blood, but as it progresses the amount of squibs we see gradually increases. Both the Statham/Adkins and Sly/JCVD fights are flat out action cinema at its best. I honestly have a hard time choosing which one I liked more. Some have said the Sly/JCVD fight was too short, but in my opinion it was close to perfect. The finale at the airport is an action fan's wet dream come true!<br/><br/>I went into the film expecting little to no swearing at all, and I will report that there is actually more than I anticipated. It's still not much, but 'sh!t' is used a handful of times throughout the film along with a few others. No f-bomb's though. I personally don't care about the profanity (or lack thereof), but I know some people do.<br/><br/>Now, to what I didn't like about the film: Some lines and takes from the trailer have either been changed or removed completely. Maybe it's just because I've watched the trailer a grand total of 403 billion times and thought I knew what to expect, but it still annoyed me. Also, I didn't really like how both Arnold and Chuck magically appear and disappear in the movie, with no real explanations given on how they got from place to place. Again, this may just be a personal preference, and one could even argue that this aspect of the film enhances their mystique, but I fought it slightly lame. The plane crash sequence features some CGI which isn't the best, but thankfully it doesn't last long. These are honestly the only parts of the film that I didn't like, which are really a bunch of my nit-picky personally preferences that don't affect the film as a whole. The fact that these tiny little details are the only things about the film that I didn't really like are a GOOD THING!<br/><br/>All in all: EX2 is a great action film that delivers with a Rocky-esque punch to the face. Stallone is still going strong, Arnold is back, and this is the best film on Statham's resume. There are plenty of homages and references to classic action films and the body count is high. <br/><br/>--How'd I'd rate the film‚Äî<br/><br/>From a technical filmmaking perspective: 7.5/10<br/><br/>As an action throwback to the good ol' days: 9/10"
"dfranzen70","8","23","42","25 August 2012"," Blood and guts and veins in my teeth
","You don't feel the testosterone in The Expendables 2 as much as immerse yourself in it, whether you like it or not. It manages to be awesome on several levels ‚Äì a frantic action movie, a self-deprecating comedy, and¬Ö okay, that's about it. But still! Explosions that make sense! The mocking of catch phrases! Great casting that doesn't feel forced! Stallone not in the director's chair! Yes, there's so much to like about the movie that we can overlook a lot of clich√©s and hammy performances. Let's look at the plot. Barney Ross (Stallone) and his team, having bilked Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) out of $5 million in the first movie, now have to make amends. No, Church doesn't have them tossed into Gitmo, and he doesn't kill them. Instead, he gives them a mission, the accomplishment of which would make them all even-Steven.<br/><br/>The mission involves an infiltration into the jungles of Albania to rescue a secret something (a MacGuffin) from a downed airplane. Things don't go as expected. Ross and his team lose not only the MacGuffin but also one of their own. Tearfully, they vow revenge.<br/><br/>Ross's team consists of Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), Toll Road (Randy Couture) and Bill the Kid (Liam Hemsworth). Church inexplicably adds another member to their team ‚Äì a soldier/intel expert named Maggie (Nan Yu). She may have been the second MacGuffin.<br/><br/>The team tracks the bad guys to a series of secret mines in old Russia, where apparently a metric buttload of uranium exists for the taking. The bad guys, led by the well-named Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme), plan to grab all of the unguarded uranium and, presumably, either hold the world hostage or just blow it up. We're not told, because it hardly matters.<br/><br/>Now, this may not be the best of films. You won't find a truly intricate plot, even by Mission:Impossible standards. It is what it purports to be: men blowing stuff up with lots of weapons. At least this time there's a woman involved, but you can guess one of the reasons she's there. In any event, the stunts are exhilarating to watch and the action is intense, but what makes the film is the deft, complementary comedy. Church versus Ross. Ross versus Trench (Arnold Schwarzeneggar, yes). Trench versus Church. The movie is, in its entirety, a nod to the mindless action movies of the 80s in which many of these fellas appeared. Catchphrases from those old movies are mocked. Everyone looks bad ass, so much so that you forget that guys like Stallone and Schwarzeneggar are in their sixties.<br/><br/>It was exciting to see the oldtimers in the first film, and this one adds some new (old) blood. Hemsworth, although not as ripped as his brother Chris, is terrific. Oh, and did I mention that a certain Chuck Norris is in this? I am not making this up. He's in it. I love how he's referred to as a lone wolf, a nod to his movie Lone Wolf McQuade, or that his character is named Booker, a nod to his movie Good Guys Wear Black. I wish he'd been able to do some martial arts, but the man's 70 years old, so I guess we can cut him some slack.<br/><br/>This is a manly man movie. There's a lot of blood, many guns, lots of scars in the making. There is no romance, barely some flirting. You wouldn't expect that, anyway. The Expendables 2 delivers what it promises ‚Äì it's a whipped-up frenzied concoction of old-school action movies with a generous sprinkling of creativity (in script and in cinematography).<br/><br/>So that's why I liked the movie. Blood, guts, witty repartee, that about does it for me when I want not to think. You won't need to think here. Watch it ‚Äì your brain will appreciate the rest."

Also, I hate it that they had to kill Hemsworth's character so fast; I think he has the potential to be on the mercenaries.<br/><br/>Sorry I can't help of those spoilers (LOL).

"edgerly_brian","2","13","23","26 August 2012"," I laughed. I cried. But I did neither of those things when this movie intended me to.
","The first installment of this series was bad. But after reading multiple reviews calling this one a good movie, and also having some friends tell me so, I decided to give it a shot. This movie is bad. Like really bad. No, I'm serious this movie is terrible. I intently watched all 102 minutes of it, and I have no clue what the plot of this movie was. I read somewhere that Stallone was calling out the action stars of today. He was calling them sissies or whatever it is he mumbled about. Maybe it's just me, but I like most of the action stars of today. Back in the 80's and 90's when Stallone(who is 5'9"" by the way) was a superstar, bigger was better. Nobody cared about plot lines as long as s*** blew up!!! Wooo!!! Well, I actually enjoy watching stories that make sense. EXP 2 made absolutely no sense. At least you knew the general outline of what was going on in those old school movies from decades back. This movie is complete s***.<br/><br/>The opening scene, while visually pretty entertaining(I mean they do take out a helicopter with a motorcycle within the first 10 minutes of the film!!), makes no effort to clue you in on what's going on. They save a Chinese billionaire from an apparently evil group of Asian militants. You are not told who he was, who the bad guys are, or why these men were here to save him. All you find out is that these guys will shoot the head off of anything in their way. And also that apparently their bullets are 3 times more effective than a normal bullet. Seriously throughout this movie there was a 3:1 kill/Bullet ratio. Liam, brother of Thor, and wanna be lover of Katpiss, shoots 5 or 6 people at once with a sniper rifle. I mean they all fell down at almost exactly the same time. Look I've played hours of call of duty, so I can expertly contest that this is physically impossible. Next, they fly off in a plane to some s***ty bar where everyone gets drunk. It's here that Dolph Lundgren reveals himself a genius that revised Einstein's Theory of Relativity, then blows his nose with the formula. Because as everyone knows, to make a plot line seem more credible you need at least one barely understandable giant to be smarter than Albert Einstein. Well then, check that off the list.<br/><br/>The story line somehow gets worse from there. Including a scene where half the characters stand around doing nothing while three guys hold open a steel door that is threatening to crush one of their members. Hey, uh, a little help!! And there is also a scene in which Sylvester ""top heavy"" Stallone kicks JC Van Damme's a**. This would not happen in real life, because in real life Van Damme's first round house kick would have beheaded Sylvester ""5'9"""" Stallone. Also, the two of them would have spent at least 10-30 more minutes staring at each other while making guttural noises for no reason.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the movie was when Stallone was reading the love letter of the recently departed Liam Thorsworth. Maybe it's just me, but the unintentional comedy of Stallone mumbling through a love letter 3 sentences long, written in what was probably 36pt font, was off the charts. I couldn't contain myself. I was crying. And not in the way intended.<br/><br/>Also, and I mean no disrespect to these ""giant"" men, but it doesn't seem plausible that one could shoot that many peoples' heads off with machine guns while only using one arm. I mean, you know, unless Chuck Norris is doing it... You know what, never mind that. I had given this movie 1 star but I'm changing it to 2 stars out of respect for Chuck Norris and his sweet fisty beard."

What a waste of talent especially with the addition of Scott Adkins, he should have been in a fight scene with jet Li not Statham, Statham didn't know what the hell to do while Adkins was throwing them kicks. Just like Stallone and Van Damme's fight, 2 spinning back kicks and then gets beat up. What a joke, might as well just shoot him.<br/><br/>For those of you who did not see it, don't bother.

Sometimes you just have to realise you are too old. You cannot be an action hero when you are in your sixties and have had numerous ops and hair transplants to prolong your youth. It looked more like the waxworks images from madame Tussuad's than the real characters. Give it up Sylvester and make way for someone new. As Bruce said, Arnolds been back enough. Apart from these shortcomings, the plot leaves a lot to be desired. Now if I bought a product in a shop that wasn't fit for purpose I would have legal rights to obtain a refund.

","A film so poor that reviewing it seems almost redundant. <br/><br/>This was the first movie I've ever walked out on. The corny references to Terminator, Die Hard and Rambo were too much to stomach. Half of the dialogue seemed to be dedicated to setting up ""jokes"" (for lack of a better word), and Chuck Norris' cameo seemed almost satirical. <br/><br/>Unless you enjoy a film with incomprehensible, gap-filled plots and actors well past their expiry date, then Expendables 2 is not recommended. I can only assume that when Stallone's character says ""Track 'em, find 'em, kill 'em"", he's referring to the person who wrote this movie's script."

","Ridiculous, unending, unbelievable action with the good guys mowing down the bad guys with little or no effort or seriousness. Just a bunch of geriatric egomaniacs flexing for the camera and advertising plastic surgery, dental work and mens hair coloring. I fell asleep 45 minutes into the film and when I woke it was just more of the same and I didn't care a bit about what was happening in the movie so I just got up and left. This movie is a complete waste. They are forcing me to write 10 lines of text in order to post, but seriously there isn't enough content in this movie to write 10 lines about. The only legit actor in this movie with any impactful skill is Willis, but he is barely in the movie. Stalone, Arnold, Norris, Van Damme, and Lundgren should quit acting."

Chuck Norris, Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, John Claude van Damme, Dolph Lundgren & Arnold Schwarzenegger. Why was Mickey Rourke left out?....Anyway, my point is the IMDb score does not reflect the movie.<br/><br/>Oh, wait a minute before you stop reading this complete review and spit mouthful for me, there was a story and a potential to implement it in a classy way. I mean to say the script was sucky. <br/><br/>In middle of the action I felt like not watching it anymore. The script was that sucky.<br/><br/>Enough about the script, the movie had one thing different; whenever we see some movie that brings feeling of nostalgia within, it generally is heart-warming. In this movie they experimented with that feeling too by mixing, should I say intertwining, Nostalgia with Comedy."

","I was a huge fan of the Expendables, and was hoping that this one would at least be as good (with the addition of Scott Adkins, how could it go wrong?) The movie though, rather than being a movie that can stand on its own merits, like Rambo, Terminator, or the first Expendables, it tries to sell itself on the actors and their previous movies. It comes across as cheesy, and an insulting parody of the genre, rather than an addition to it. Stallone really needs to be more involved in the making of the third one, and they have to make a movie that can stand on its own two feet, and not rely on the previous accomplishments of the stars. Right now it is remembering (and insulting) history, not making history."

","The movie is the second instalment of The Expendable series but this movie is better then the first one. The movie lacks a good plot and storyline but compensate with great great action. Sylvester Stallone is as good always, Jason statham justifies his image of a ruthless action hero, Dolph Lundgreen, Terry crews and Randy couture did their job with perfection but JCVD was a little disappointing as a villain, his Character should've been crafted with more perfection. Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Chuck Norris are treat for the eyes. Yu nan hasn't got the opportunity to perform and that's justified coz of lots of stars in the movie. Background music is good and suites according to the requirement. Screenplay could've been made more impressive. Overall a no brainier pure action movie and it'll not disappoint."

This movie doesn't even take itself seriously, which is a good thing. Part of the effort and energy of the film, particularly the writing, seemed to be to get all the great actors into the film including their ""signature"" lines.

","I wasn't expecting a great script, great acting or even great direction and I didn't get any of those from watching 'The Expendables' (although the direction wasn't terribly bad and Jean Claude Van Damme was actually quite good). Roarke's absence was quite evident (him being the best thing in the previous film). However, the over the top action sequences were entertaining to watch and well choreographed. That's one of the main reasons why such films were popular in the 80s and 90s and director Simon West and Sylvester Stallone know this. This is a homage to those films. The highlight is the final action sequence that's set in an airport where you've got former action film icons fighting alongside and against each other. Chuck Norris's cameo expectedly makes one cringe and there was too little of Jet Li. This is by no means a classic and I hardly would've have missed anything had I chosen not to see it but fans of action flicks (particularly of the 80s and 90s 'era') might consider this a worthy watch"
"Leofwine_draca","8","2","2","14 December 2012"," Blistering action flick
","Wow! THE EXPENDABLES 2 is exactly what it sets out to be: a genuinely exciting, fast-paced action movie packed with all manner of violent shoot-outs, show-downs and stuff blowing up. It's a definite improvement on the first film, doing away with the poor CGI blood and dodgy shaky-cam in favour of plentiful set-pieces that are well-shot and easy to follow. Okay, so there's a certain repetitiveness in watching nameless bad guys being blown away by massive guns and the plot is hardly anything to write home about, but nevertheless I had a ball with this film.<br/><br/>One reason I particularly like it is for the cast. As a fan of action cinema, especially that of the '80s, how could I fail to love the calibre of the ensemble squad they've assembled here? The good news is that roles for Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger have been beefed up and the less interesting members of the crew (Terry Crews and Randy Couture) have been put into the background, as is right. Add in some hilarious moments for Chuck Norris and a hateful villain in no less than Jean-Claude Van Damme, and you have action movie heaven. Watching these guys trading quips is my idea of fun, and Schwarzenegger in particular seems to be having a ball. You realise just how much you've missed his trademark humour when you see him in action here.<br/><br/>Others in the cast fare less well, but are still worth seeing. Jet Li contributes some blistering hand-to-hand combat at the outset but then disappears for no good reason, while Jason Statham feels slightly wooden for the first time, his hard-man schtick grating on the nerves a little. Dolph Lundgren gets very little screen time too, although we do get Scott Adkins lending skillful support as a henchman. Director Simon West brings the same level of anything-goes OTT mayhem to this film as he did to CON AIR, banishing memories of WHEN A STRANGER CALLS at the same time. At this rate, I say bring on THE EXPENDABLES 3!"

","The Expendables 2 starts as ace sniper Billy the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) tells his boss Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) that he wants to leave the Expendables, a team of tough mercenaries who are for hire & take on dangerous jobs that need lots of firepower. Ross accepts his decision, however later that night the sinister CIA man Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) orders Ross & his team of expendables to carry out one last job for him, since Church can have them all jailed for life or killed Ross has little alternative but to agree. A plane has crashed with some extremely important cargo locked in a safe on-board, it's up to Ross & the expendables to find, retrieve & deliver the cargo back to him before it falls into the wrong hands. The mission at first seems easy & all goes well but after finding the cargo Ross & the expendables are ambushed by the sadistic Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme) & his men who steal the precious cargo & kill Billy the Kid leaving Ross & the rest of the expendables swearing vengeance...<br/><br/>Directed by Simon West who I guess was a decent enough choice after turning in enjoyable enough big budget fare like Lare Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) & the excellent Con Air (1997) which still remains one of my personal favourite OTT action films (Nicolas Cage should be in The Expendables 3... while we're at it how about Wesley Snipes & Kurt Russell too) this is a direct sequel to the highly enjoyable old school action film The Expendables (2010) & while I didn't think it was quite as good The Expendables 2 is still a lot of fun & thankfully doesn't abandon it's violent action film roots. The first twenty odd minutes & the last twenty odd minutes are brilliant, action packed, funny & highly entertaining & it's a slight shame that the intervening hour is a little dull & empty. The major problem with The Expendables 2 is the lack of a substantial story, there's very little here & what is here is merely there to hang the action set-pieces off. It's hard to think about the character's as individuals rather than the actor's that play them which is also maybe doesn't help, that's the one great negative though & the killing of Billy the Kid & the revenge mission that ensues takes a backseat to the action, the egos & the one-liners so be prepared for that. The script is nicely nostalgic, it gives the main cast plenty of opportunity to throw in several gags & references to their earlier films & well known one-liners in an amusing & playful way but never in a derogatory mocking sense. At about 100 minutes long The Expendables 2 doesn't outstay it's welcome & your never far from the fight, shoot-out, one-liner or explosion.<br/><br/>The likes of Bruce Willis & Arnold Schwarzenegger get much bigger roles this time around although Jet Li is only there for the opening fifteen minutes, I suppose we should be grateful a compromise was struck & he came back at all as he has said he wants to quit Hollywood. New action film star additions to the cast include the legendary Chuck Norris who seems very game to live up to his reputation (the Cobra gag is hilarious) while Jean-Claude Van Damme is still in very good shape unlike a few of the other's as age catches up with them but to be fair the fact they are all in such good shape at their age says a lot. Jason Statham is great values as always, his sole fight scene in a Chapel is fantastic as are all the action scenes, West manages to bring scale & excitement to things while never confusing matters with shaky hand-held camcorder crap & quick editing. This is the way action scenes should be shot, loud, violent & great fun, the hilarious scene with Schwarzenegger & Willis in the little car is worth watching the film for on it's own. 80's & 90's action fans starved of that type of film over recent years should definitely get a kick out of it.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $100,000,000 The Expendables 2 has great action scenes & plenty of star power, during the 80's & 90's who would have thought all the top action film stars of the day would team up? Filmed in China & the US but mainly in Bulgaria. I liked the performances here, everyone seems to be having fun although I wasn't impressed with new female team member Nan Yu who has little to do & gets lost amongst the egos.<br/><br/>The Expendables 2 is a great old school action film, full of violence, gun fights, explosions & senseless death & destruction. What more do you want? Apart from a story that is. 80's & 90's action fans should lap it up, I did. Apparently The Expendables 3 is already in production."

I have to admit I had a smile on my face as I watched the likes of Stallone, Statham, Van Damme, Jet Li, Lundgren, Chuck Norris, Bruce Willis and AR-NULD all together back up on the screen!!! Is what I am watching absolutely ridiculous? YES! Highly improbable? UNEQUIVOCALLY! Completely fictitious in every possible way? UNDENIABLY!!! However, was I being entertained? INDUBITABLY!!!<br/><br/>In this iteration of the Stallone franchise, Barney Ross (Stallone), and his merry men of mercenaries are dispatched to retrieve an access key and location to a stockpile of Russian plutonium, which was part of the payload that went down in a plane crash. However, once they attain the access key, they are immediately ambushed by a terrorist organization that also have their sights on the Russian plutonium supply. <br/><br/>There is nothing original being brought to the screen in this film; it's just 100% male testosterone smash 'em up action with a touch of adrenaline rush!! But what I really enjoyed is how director Simon West (Con Air / The Mechanic) was able to showcase each individual action icon in their own featured hi-lighted action sequence√Ç‚Ä¶ my favorite being the ""Chuck Norris"" sequence by far!! I had not paid that much attention to all the stars who had signed on for this action epic, so as the smoke cleared and Chuck Norris appeared, it was an unexpected pleasure!!! <br/><br/>Again, this film is far from Oscar worthiness; however, it's exactly what you would come to expect in your circa 1980-90's action adventure genre. So I can and do highly recommend this film, and I am happy to report that the pre-production for ""The Expendables 3"" is already underway!!!

","I disagree with some people feeling that this film was no better than the first. It is easily better than the first, which is a very hard thing to do (normally). I thought the first movie wasn't brill but it was OK, it was kind of what I expected but I did expect a bit more in the fight scenes and I felt that Jet Lei just like the story wasn't up to much. Everything Stallone is doing here is a great idea and it has a great feel to it. Expendables 2 has finally got to where the first one should've been. This one is far more enjoyable, the action / fight scenes are better, which is mainly why we watch these sorts of films, but also the characters and their relationships with each other are better. Some of the scenes are pure genius. Some of the scenes are not but hey ho. I am really looking forward to a 3rd instalment but I do feel that they will take it too far and end up with some of the most annoying and worst ones appearing like Steven Seagal and Vin Deisel... I hope not! If they do then they might as well go the whole hog and get the Heather Small bird from M People on there to just totally annoy us all!! <br/><br/>Expendables 2... Anyone who is between the age of 30 and 60 that remembers the best 80's action flicks with the likes of Arnie, Stallone, Bruce Willis, van damme in will know that these films didn't ever really have great acting in, it was all about the action and the fight scenes.

","Barney Ross (Stallone) and his rivet crapping tough mercenaries are neck deep in gunpowder as they infiltrate a terrorist camp somewhere in Nepal. Shooting, stabbing, punching and frying pan fighting (yes frying pans!) gets the team to their target. The objective is to extract a rich Chinese billionaire for reasons unknown. Much like Liam Neeson in the A TEAM, Barney runs into Trench (Schwarzenegger) who has beaten him to the price. However the Terminator has been bested for the time being by the terrorists and is grateful to see his ex-comrade. Simon West and his team of explosive experts blows up the place in a million dollar fashion as the mercenaries take off to the skies in the trusty old Sea Plane. The first thumbs for this motion picture is its special effects.<br/><br/>Billionaire contractor Church (Willis) approaches Barney with a mission. To retrieve an article from a wreckage of a plane that has been shot down. Church adds in a member to Barney's team. A woman named Maggie (Nan Yu). Along with Maggie and the rest of his mercenaries, Barney extracts the article from the wreckage only to have it bargained off him by a man only referred to as by the villain (Van Damme) who holds Billy (Liam Hemsworth) one of his crew as hostage. <br/><br/>Amidst the fire power and knuckle bashing there isn't much room to elaborate on certain obviously visible traits of sense making (emotion) in THE EXPENDABLES 2. It would not be inappropriate to consider THE EXPENDABLES 2 as a motion picture made primarily aimed at fans of the veteran stars. It has been too long since Schwarzenegger and Norris were on the wide screen. As memory serves it would be T3 and WALKER Texas RANGER; hence the excitement about the movie THE EXPENDABLES 2 apart from the already killer cast. This is the motion pictures second thumbs up.<br/><br/>Whilst this critic has forgotten entirely what the first installment of THE EXPENDABLES was like it is without a doubt that it will not be the same for the 2 installment. CON AIR director Simon West who takes over from Stallone and is craftily working his behind the camera wizardry. One cannot but see a few similarities in the direction approach to the art of war of THE EXPENDABLES 2 and CON AIR. The seaplane involved stunts, the gunfights, the bear fisted bashing with knuckle dusters along with precise camera placement are evidence of well planned and executed direction and cinematography. It would be wrong if it isn't highlighted that this picture will be most entertaining to the fan boys of action movies who simply like nothing more than explosions, gun fire and boisterous slapstick comedy. The third thumbs up come in a two-folded manner. First being that this movie is much better than the first one and the second being the cinematography is powerful and consistently rapid firing just like the 50 caliber machine guns in the movie.<br/><br/>Statham and Stallone keep the testosterone flowing while Terry Crews is as always the funny big guy. Jet Li is short lived in this installment and is truly missed by his fans while Arnie, Norris and Bruce slap out some dialogue that are humorously connected with those great movies of the yester-year. Having been a fan of Van Damme since the growing years this critic is certainly amazed how the 52 year old martial arts expert still pulled out his round house kicks. If one may compare his kicks with that of the all time favorite Van Damme movie HARD TARGET from 1993, the kick just looks the same. If he had support or not is an entirely different factor, as for the audience, the star still is very able of kicking butt.<br/><br/>After the close encounter with disappointment in the first movie many still have doubts about this as well. To be said in the simplest form of summary; THE EXPENDABLES 2 does not have time for starting credits. It explodes in your face with action and rarely takes a breather during in 103 minutes of runtime. Decently balanced with humor and compressed with Hollywood royalty the only miss is the shallow story. With this kind of ""oooomph"" pressurized into 103 minutes it makes sense why Simon West let the reins lose on the story value. Personally with this kind of action one does not need a storyline to be entertained.<br/><br/>A movie for the fan boys strictly. THE EXPENDABLES 2 still stands in the top 10 at the US box office for total gross for 2012. <br/><br/>TITLE: THE EXPENDABLES 2 DIRECTED BY: SIMON WEST STARRING: SYLVESTER STALLONE, BRUCE WILLIS, CHUCK NORRIS,JASON STATHAM,JET LI, JEAN CLAUDE VAN DAMME, TERRY CREWS, LIAM HEMSWORTH, RANDY COUTURE, DOLPH LUNDGREN, NAN YU & ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER.

The are also some quotes on movie classics (you know: terrorized village graving for help, some stranger(s) come(s) and blah, blah, blah) and it is altogether fun. Nice 100 minutes (with credits). Mindless but fun nevertheless. Arnie is finally ""back"" (after so many promises), nobody beats Chuck Norris (I guess jokes about him are true; most of them) and it all looks like a nice geriatric party (only shooting, no singing).

But hey, the film is a mindless kill a minute tribute to a forgotten or more precisely, abandoned genre. Just like movie junkies of the fifties and sixties like to say 'They just don't make'em like John Wayne and Clint Eastwood.' So can action movie lovers of the seventies and eighties mourn the death of the Schwarzenegger/Seagal/Van Damm/Russel/Lungdren/Norris/Daniels/Lee/Hauser(Wings, not Cole)/Grunner/etc. era of sometimes cheesy, always over the top, always awesome, action movies. I suppose Sly's goal here, and with the first film, was to celebrate that bygone age of action flick by assembling some of his eighties competition stars, and supplementing them with a few contemporary shoot'em up guys. Personally, I loved the movie, but I don't get the casting of Crews, Couture and Hemsworth. No dice, Sly--those guys haven't earned spots beside the likes of yourself and the others we all know and love. And you forgot to include some of the best and brightest of that golden age of blood and guts. Where was Olivier Grunner? How about Rutger Hauer for goodness sake? Kurt Russel? Steven-I am God-Seagal? A travesty, Sly. A travesty. Anyway, the movie was good, was worth the ticket price, and after all is said and done, was really just a spoof, an excuse to get all these guys together on screen at once. Gets an 8/10 for leaving out some of the best eighties action stars, while including wannabe modern actors without a clue of which way to point their barrels. Go see it--if you're a child of said era of action flicks."

"billygoat1071","6","14","27","18 August 2012"," A Fan Service Mess
","The Expendables never really had other higher ambitions than to assemble these action movie stars and let them do something loud and ridiculously awesome. The first film was fun but it is overall forgettable and it feels like a modern B action movie cookie-cutter. This sequel tries to recapture the old style of action filmmaking by showing a lot of non-CGI'd ravaging machines smash stuff on screen and reduce the use of shaky camera. It works better to the film, but the result is a mess. Since the action is really ought to be messy good fun, the movie itself is also a mess. But if you're careless about that then turn off your brain and watch all the heads explode.<br/><br/>The Expendables 2 is nothing more than a fan service. The movie has a lot of action and the stars definitely made it very entertaining. Sylvester Stallone is still as great as he is. Jason Statham is still wonderfully enchanting. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Chuck Norris are fun to watch despite of their over referenced dialogue. Disappointingly, Jean-Claude Van Damme only had few scenes but at least we get to see him fight. And Terry Crews and Dolph Lundgren are the comic relief of the film.<br/><br/>This sequel has no utter difference to the first one except the moderated CGI and the old school action film look. There's not much going on about the plot. All that matters here is the action, but everything was paused at the second act where the hero spends most of the time brooding. It's like a generic adventure movie where there are bunch of guys fighting, then sit down, then meet some people. Fight, meet, sit, until the climax comes.<br/><br/>When it hits to the climax, the movie suddenly realized that they were sleepwalking through the drama and they forgot that it is all about the loud gunfights and the explosions. So they immediately ignored Ross's brooding and let the bullets fly and the blood flow. The way they put the action scenes to the story is pretty mediocre. Much worse is the climax is too rushed, the whole slam-bang quickly cuts to random shots of the characters. It's thoroughly messy. The experience would be better if you don't care about the flaws, but it's too noticeable.<br/><br/>The Expendables 2 is somewhat like Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. There's no much of a plot, no good script, but the pleasure of its stars made it at least watchable. It's still not considered as a good movie. My rating may be too high for this review, but this is what we expect. Explosions, gunfights, kung fu, fistfights, and Chuck Norris. It's a fan service that mixes all the references and the action together. Still, it could have been better. The movie could have been less messy. The climax could have been less rushed. The film has potential by its production value and its stars, but the filmmakers choose to be mediocre anyway. In the end, The Expendables 2 is no relic nor classic, but just another blockbuster."

","6 stars would rate it a good movie. 4 stars rates it below average which it is. The movie isn't better or worse than the first. Action is without suspense and there is no sense of space or logic in the gunfights. There is some choreography, mostly Statham and Stallone, but gunfights are pure randomness and good guys win. Camera and editing was mediocre, soundtrack was generic.<br/><br/>There was only enough character humor to miss more of it. Almost all actors are underused and references to their previous famous roles are rare without any depth (""I'll be back"". That's it for Arnie. Really? Did he come back only to say that?).<br/><br/>Anyway, you will like EX2 exactly as much as you did the Expendables. It could have been made into proper action, or proper trash or an absurd comedy like Top Secret. Or characters could have been fleshed out, for a change. What a waste of awesomness.<br/><br/>PS Van Damme is pretty good as scumbag. Lundgren is actually funny when drunk, sadly it's about 17 seconds only."

","I loved this movie so much I went back to watch it in the next showing!!!! I saw a few others walk in during the second viewing, that I could tell came from their first viewing too!!!! With that, I had to put my first ever review online! It will be short (i think!) and sweet! I read a few other reviews that go with how I feel and I want to say, yes, exactly! Great to see others see what Sly was trying to do!!!! They must have had a blast doing this movie. I wont go into details for examples so I don't spoil anything! So, in a nutshell, Sly, first of all, if it wasn't for you, the first one never would've came out either. Meaning, thank him for getting our movie heroes/action guys together and now for a second time with a few that were wanted for the first one! So, for all the fans of these guys' movies, get to the theater NOW! Secondly, this movie to me, even though I am a woman, is I believe every man's dream come true of seeing what they'd love to do if they had a chance. That is being invincible dudes, fighting against evil as a career,and having fun doing it. If anyone has issues with this movie, they need to have an attitude adjustment and get some humor in their personality!!!! Thank you Sly again for making another movie and bringing your buds with you for the journey for the second time! Your movies are pretty much all I go see now!!! Lastly, if there were special effects in this movie....where were they? Meaning, nothing looked fake! Sly and his partners did an awesome job with all the action shots. Don't know if any body doubles were used much. Everyone seems to do most or all of their own stunts, AGAIN like the first one!! OK, really, lastly. For the bad reviewers out there, I'd like to see what you can do with paying homage to our movie heroes/action guys, because it was the best and I don't know how you cant give Sly credit where credit and a good review is due!!! As Rocky would say, ""Absolutely""!"
"geniustablehq-31-532637","2","8","15","26 August 2012"," Cringeworthy story that the movie isn't funny enough to compensate for
","I will briefly discuss the horrible storyline, before I discuss the trite action.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a group of men from different first-world countries slaughtering a bunch of armed dudes. You're not really sure who to route for, or why. The dudes being attacked are torturing Schwarzenegger, so if we are morally opposed to torture then I guess the white/wealthy minority people are in the right here. (Later on the good guys use torture on some people they find and beat up in a bar, so its not much of a moral leg to stand on) The plot is just a haggard series of stepping stones to justify fighting. They will randomly decide on 'no guns' for no real reason when they need an excuse to bring the brass knuckles out, and at one point there is an airport with no visible security staff next to an abandoned plutonium mining facility.<br/><br/>The 'baddie' steals a device from the indiscriminate killers we are supposed to think of as 'goodies', which is supposedly a device leading to tonnes of plutonium that had been abandoned during the cold war. The baddies turn out to have been digging for the plutonium for months (so why they needed the map is a little beyond me), but the plutonium ends upbeing behind a large steel hatch in plain sight. Because apparently thepeople who used to work in the mine cared little for safety and didn't think to put up a sign saying 'warning, plutonium'. Or hell, the baddies could have found the hatch using a Geiger counter and common sense. Probably should have checked the large hatch in the middle of the mine, lads. The baddies then imprison and endanger their own workers for absolutely no reason other than allowing the Goodies to free them later. Because they have to make the good guys on the side of freedom! At one stage the baddies chase a small boy to try and force him to dig in the mine, even though the boys village is full of women in perfectly good shape. Apparently little boys are better miners than grown-ass women. Because terrorists are totally against using women as slaves? Okay.<br/><br/>The 'plot' aside, you would think fun action would compensate. Sadly not. There isn't even a hint of tension or suspense at any stage, its just the good guys firing and hitting their targets while the bad guys fire and hit nearby buildings/civilians. Stormtrooper syndrome, while clustering together to make more of them blow up per explosion.<br/><br/>There are multiple contrived fist fights, and bad guys are often kind enough to point their guns away so that knives can be thrown in their faces plausibly. I really feel like this is a bit of a mismatch. The good guys kill hundreds of armed men, but not a single bad guy ever kills an armed man, or so much as wounds him. Stallone's shirt gets shot twice, but he is still able to run around and fly a plane a minute later.<br/><br/>I will finish discussing the plane. It is a water plane that can take off on land and literally glide through the water. Okay, so it is multi purpose, but as it splits the water neatly aside it is clearly a traditional water plane. It has a hatch on the bottom that people parachute out of at one stage and never seems to fill with water while on the ocean floor, but okay. At another stage they literally ride the plane along a tunnel after its wings break off, and it is suddenly flat at the bottom to accommodate drifting in a straight line. The plane is basically a transformer that fulfills different plane functions when convenient. It flies all over the world, and they never seem to need to refuel it.<br/><br/>Stallone kept making them all go to bed early and then staying up himself, or leaving parties without saying goodbye. I thought that was pretty rude of him.<br/><br/>Chuck Norris told a Chuck Norris joke and made me sad inside.<br/><br/>Terry Crews was still pretty cool, despite what he was surrounded by.<br/><br/>As my last point - the baddie is literally a Satan worshiping terrorist named 'Villain'. This makes me think this movie was meant as a parody, but if that was the case they really should have thrown a couple of jokes in instead of becoming what they were trying to mock.<br/><br/>Tldr: Bruce Willis says I'll be back, Schwarzenneger says Yippee-Kay-Yay, I died inside."
"chaos-rampant","Null","3","4","31 May 2013"," Actors Studio: First Blood
","This slays the first film both in terms of action and as a movie. It is still cookie cutter in the overall rescue mission and revenge arch, but you sort of expect no better in this area. It's always been about the action and the guys themselves.<br/><br/>The actors first. A fun, somewhat revealing way to see them in action is observing how they (the actors) handle the reality of what happens to them. Sly as head honcho shrugs it off, mostly. He has good interplay with Statham and the girl, but he needs them to draw out a few morsels of character. Statham is his usual cocky self. Lundgren as the lumberjack with a brain is a fun sidekick, goofing on precisely this lack of self-awareness that cost him a big stardom. Couture is just not an actor, but he brings a bit of un-actorly, locker-room reality that is valuable as counterpoint to all the quipping and snark.<br/><br/>Arnie and Willis are too big to fit in as core players of the 'real' movie. They appear in the movie like avatars of the actors we know, especially Arnie. The joke is extended when Chuck Norris shows up, at which point we are completely 'outside' of the film‚Äîa Norris 'fact' is even brought up in discussion. Van Damme bridges the two worlds, both his character and the actor having fun.<br/><br/>We lose Jet Li who was the only real artist with his body, but gain the wonderful Yu Nan, a marvelous presence that should be in more films, preferably by makers who can put her to good use. What an expressive face! Mixed genuine interest with quizzical amusement, pinning both the ironic distance and emotional link. She is the best thing in this, a new discovery for me.<br/><br/>Second, the action itself. Now if you look at their old films, say Terminator, you'll appreciate that the action is exciting because we assume perspectives inside the action, well a mixture of perspectives in this mode and some in the older, theatric mode favored in Bronson's time. This is now the standard cinematic vernacular for shooting action, but still pretty damn effective. When a car smashes through glass, the camera is not a bystander but bolted on the side of the car. A plane crash is presented entirely from the inside, a similar crash in The Grey is still the best filmed for my taste, most viscerally visual experience but this is close behind. By contrast to all that, we have some pretty shoddy CGI which goes a long way to exemplify that real impact is not in the mass of colliding objects but what gravity you can build in the camera.<br/><br/>A spectacular roller-coaster of destruction opens the film, establishing at the outset that we are in a movie and only movie laws apply‚Äîa few hundred extras are disposed, an armored truck barrels up a narrow escarpment. We then stop to have Arnie revealed to us, amusingly as a prisoner that needs rescuing. We then have several more ridiculous, perfectly enjoyable action pieces. But what sets this apart from the last Rambo, Universal Soldier, or Statham movie is that we have all these actors as actors referencing the fact. Some of the quips are just lame ('I'm back'), but again sort of what you'd expect.<br/><br/>I think they'd do well if they loosened this up as an ongoing film universe, where familiar faces, old and new, can zing in and out kicking ass."
"jiraf","7","3","4","16 May 2013"," Old school fun
","Let's not take this for more than what it is. It's a fun movie of the classic action heroes getting together to blow stuff up, shoot some bad guys (excessively), adventure in foreign places, riding Harley and old planes. I enjoyed the movie and the biggest action stars of previous decades making fun of each other (Willis: ""You've been back enough time, I'll be back"". Schwarzenegger: ""Yippe-ki-yay""). And Chuck Norris going through Chuck Norris jokes was priceless. It's not some deep movie about war, it's not a special effects movie, it's not a science fiction action movie, it's just a fun movie. If I can change one thing, I would pick a different lady to play Maggie Chang, needs to pick someone with better chemistry with Stallone."

I could't wait for the first, I loved the second and of course am awaiting the third with baiting breath. Half the fun is just to see who will be in it. This second installment is better than the first and Van Damme makes a terrific villain. If you like action films and love seeing all these icons on one screen, then this is it.

"MLDinTN","7","3","4","8 April 2013"," this is the movie to watch people blow stuff up
","For such a cheesy, straight forward action flick, this is actually pretty good. If you are a fan of 80 and 90s action flicks, then you gotta love this. Stallone is back with his gang plus Liam Hemsworth and we get a great rescue mission in the first 15 minutes of the film. They save someone pretty interesting. There's lots of guns, bombs, people getting their head shot off. Then Bruce Willis gives them a new mission, and the young guy gets killed, by the bad guy, conventialy named Villain, played by Van Damme. There's some silly plot about mines and plutonium, but that's not why you are watching. You want to see the ""old guys"" kick some booty and fire guns and bombs.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It's entertaining. If you like action, check it out."
"TdSmth5","7","3","4","7 December 2012"," Could be so much better
","As soon as the movie starts, we are introduced to the action as the Expendables rescue Trench and some other guy. Back at home, Ross is approached by Church for one final mission, a mission that will even things out between them. They are to collect a drive from a crashed airplane somewhere in Eastern Europe. Along for the ride is some little Chinese computer expert girl who claims to be proficient in fighting. They extract the device but are immediately confronted with a gang of bad guys led by Van Damme's Villain who take the device which has the exact location of plutonium. As a result the newest and youngest recruit will sacrifice his life. Villain starts extracting the plutonium using as slaves all the male population of nearby towns.<br/><br/>Ross decides to stop Villain but he's undermanned and underpowered until Church, Trent, and even Chuck Norris appear. ""Who's next, Rambo?"" Wisecracks Schwarzenegger in one of the funniest lines.<br/><br/>Expendables 2 follows the formula of part 1: lots of shooting and some fights, an even bigger and better cast, and all in rather understated fashion. And that is its weakness. With such a cast, they should have gone for glamour and glory. Both movies suffer from lack of self-esteem due to Stallone's humbleness. While Lundgren steals the show in part 1, in this one he doesn't get to do much. It's as if the story and camera avoids him as to not give him a chance to steal the show again. It's Schwarzenegger who gets all the funny lines. But Van Damme shines as the bad guy. And he's still in shape and can deliver some great kicks. Li and Couture have minor roles. Stallone and Crews are infinitely likable. Adkins is somewhat of a revelation. It was a mistake no to cast Gina Carano as the girl like production had intended to initially. The shootings are much more bloody, reminiscent of Rambo IV with blood squirting and shooting out in by the gallons. Statham gets most of the action screen time but the fights are disappointing and underwhelming, limiting himself to throwing knives.<br/><br/>The large scale action is filmed OK, but some of the smaller scale fights aren't convincing. Despite all that, this movie is mild and gentle, so to speak. This movie is good, but it could have been so much better. I'm also nostalgic about the 80s but this movie could have benefited from a more updated direction. Simon West, unlike what the entire cast says, is just the wrong guy to direct this movie. I can think of countless directors who would have done a much better job. At least the cinematography is nice. Everything is bright and clear and there are no gimmicks and cheesy CGI.<br/><br/>There so much potential with this franchise. I just hope for part 3 they pick a more assertive style, a better director and go for more modern action. Given how self-conscious these movies are, Joss Whedon would be ideal for directing it and enriching the script. Boaz Yakin wouldn't be a bad choice either. If they want to go with someone who could bring a fresh vision, Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. or Morten Tyldum would be good."
"bob the moo","Null","3","4","3 December 2012"," Distracting excess but mostly lacks actual excitement or reasons to be engaged
","I do enjoy a good action movie ‚Äì indeed if I'm honest I also enjoy an average action movie as long as there is lots of noise and action throughout. This was the reason i came back for the Expendables movie even though I had no real expectations of it being any good ‚Äì at very least I knew that things would explode and that the film would exist in the fantasy world of macho 80's style action movies. The opening scene of the film does leave you in no doubt as to what you are getting, as the team rescue someone from the heart of a fortified town, killing probably hundreds in the first 15 minutes alone. It isn't thrilling but it is very loud and enjoyable for what it is.<br/><br/>Sadly it cannot just keep doing this and at some point the characters need to talk and a rough plot needs to come out. At this point the film really grinds to a halt because none of the dialogue actually works particularly well. It tends to come in one of two forms, the most painful of which is the vague attempts at depth or character. These lines tend to be said by a grave-side, in the quiet moments when the odds look bad or in other reflective moments; I think one line actually worked but generally they are corny as hell and clunk across the screen ‚Äì at best some of them are just misjudged for the tone of the film or the scene. The other dialogue tends to be jokey banter but, although it is occasionally amusing in its obviousness, this doesn't work either because it always feels scripted right down to the letter. The delivery doesn't help but the writing seems to be all about making as many references to the star's other films as possible ‚Äì not making them clever references, but just making them out loud. Even when it is just banter without the references, it doesn't feel natural and it doesn't have much spark to it. Fortunately this does still leave the action sequences.<br/><br/>The action is mostly noisy, OTT and silly but it works as such, causing mayhem and having large action stars being indestructible in the way that they used to in the 80's. Problem is that there is a reason why those films had to change over time, because it is hard to really build tension and excitement when your stars are unstoppable and the action is very much ""A-Team with blood"". As seen here, the action doesn't thrill because it doesn't change too much and doesn't provide much in the way of creativity or actual danger being posed to the characters. There are some exceptions but these are few and far between ‚Äì Jet Li's group fight early on was enjoyable for him being given the space to work, while Stallone and Van Damme's head-to-head is fun even if it isn't as good as it could have been and doesn't do quite as much as I would have liked.<br/><br/>Just as he helps that final fight though, Van Damme does help the cast and makes a great villain. I am not sure why the film gave him so little to do but he makes an impact with little time as he is colourful and crazy. Of the rest it is variable but generally tends towards the obvious. Stallone is fairly hard to understand and has no range here ‚Äì not sure what he is trying to do but he can't find a character of interest and he doesn't do much for the fun aspect. Statham on the other side does a great job again by playing to his strengths of humour and physical ability ‚Äì like Li in that regard, he gets to do what works for him. Crews, Lundgren and Couture are so-so while Norris, Schwarzenegger and Willis are there for their names more than anything else. The addition of Yu could have made some difference but mainly she is given terrible ""fawning"" material with Stallone which is badly done.<br/><br/>Expendables 2 is not an awful film if you come to it to get the thing it offers ‚Äì mindless OTT action in a very basic mould. As such I quite enjoyed it but it would have been much better to actually care about it or be thrilled by it ‚Äì as such it is a real basic action movie that only stands out from the straight-to-video market by virtue of the stars involved."
"colm-hearne365","8","3","4","27 October 2012"," Better than the first one
","I enjoyed the first Expendables movie but I felt like it was missing something or it wasn't enough or Sylvester Stallone wasn't a good enough director for it. But thanks to Simon West, The Expendables 2 turned out to be better, funnier, more exciting and more badass than it's original.<br/><br/>One of my favourite things about this movie is that it shows more of Arnold Schwarzenegger(Trench)and Bruce Willis (Church)fighting alongside Stallone's character, Barney Ross. So you might say it's Rambo, The Terminator and John McClane all kicking ass in one movie. Even Chuck Norris, as the Lone Wolf was a nice touch too. <br/><br/>I know The Expendables is more about action than a storyline, but what makes them so special and amazing is that it brings together all the greatest action stars to make one action movie. And The Expendables 2 does have a better story because Barney and his gang are fighting in Russia, a big and powerful country, while in the first one they were just fighting on a small island in the Caribbean. I mean these guys are like The Avengers of action movies, in fact. I mean even when their young friend, Billy gets killed, they are out for revenge. Even Jean- Claude Van Damme was an even better villain because the first Expendables didn't really have a good antagonist. <br/><br/>Another thing that makes this sequel better than the first is it has more references to classic action movies through one-liners. I mean even the fight scene between Barney and Villain reminded me of the hand-in- hand combat in Commando. <br/><br/>The only thing I miss in this movie is that Mickey Rourke's character never appeared or even made a reference. But hopefully him and other action stars will be in The Expendables 3, if there is one."
"hobgoblinlol","6","3","4","11 October 2012"," Well
","I didn't like the first one that much despite having a kick-ass cast it kinda had a weak story-line. The main thing in Expendables were the actors. And I mean of course it is great to see our favorite action stars come together including retro ones, but the movie didn't have much. It hardly had any villains to stand up to those people besides, Austin who had a decent fight scene and did kick Barney's ass, but then got killed in a very dumb way. Like i said not much of a story line, BUT the sequel changes and improves that as far as i can see.<br/><br/>In expendables 2 the story-line is improved, bigger cast is assembled and it has a lot better action including retro stars like Arnold and Willis and Chuck Norris shooting the hell out of everything. In expendables 2 we all so get better villains. Jean Claude Van Damme is a perfect villain and he plays a guy called ''Jean Villain'' which is a cool name, but kinda unoriginal if you get my point. For me, he stole the show, but sadly he wasn't in it much which is a let down. Also, Scott Adkins did a great job too. I really liked Boyka looks he had playing Hector. So, yes, the Villains were pretty cool in this movie. Also, there are so much good cameos and references made in the movie that it cracks me up time to time. Like the part where Dolph calls Arnold ''Terminator'' or when Arnold says his famous line. The thing is that expendables needs work on the story-line and character development. Also, it'll be nice to see them reload more often and of course clich√© of 7-8 dudes killing hundreds is in there which enjoyable of course along with rest. Cheesy, but great. And that's what i like about the movie. It's not trying to be God father or Pulp Fiction. It knows that it's just trying to be a kick-ass action film to entertain fans and it is self-aware and yes, i think it does a fine job at it despite some clich√©s and stuff and it is an awesome movie. But now it has 7.3 and who knows? maybe even lower in other sites sadly. The thing with expendables is that: take ALL of those actors away and replace them with some random dudes. The movie won't be great, because stand-alone story-line and stuff aren't that good. Expendables 2 is a a great, especially for all retro action fans out there. But it needs to work on story-line, suspense, less-clich√©s and other stuff. If they improve even better for the next Expendables ( i heard Van Damme is coming back as twin brother of Villain which is cool) and give it a much better story instead of mind less shooting it will have a score of 8.0.<br/><br/>Now, some cons: Jet Li disappears after the intro scene, Van Damme and Adkins aren't in it much, is little bit clich√©, Willis, Norris and Arny aren't in it much too and the fight scene in the and was a let down and was egotistic for Stallone. Van Damme should have got more offense instead of getting punched 50 times by Stallone, he should of kicked Stallone's ass! same thing with Adkins vs Statham. Adkins should of beat Statham's ass. And that's also clich√©, because good guys go through everything with ease. There are only few scenes when they take cover. Stallone does get kinda beat up by Van damme, but not enough. Same thing with Statham vs Adkins.<br/><br/>Still, a good movie. 6/10 check it out."

"danebprd","4","4","6","18 January 2013"," Not a snoozer, but not suspenseful either.
","This movie wasn't great, however it wasn't as terrible as some people have made it out to be. Yes, there are problems and plot holes, but if you walked into the theater expecting perfection, you definitely walked into the wrong movie. Sure, you have Sly with his doctored permanently surprised eyebrows and Arnie with his receding hairline, but the fact that they're old and plastic is not the problem here. I couldn't care less if they're 90 and attempting to create an action movie- more power to'em. The problem is that the writing is bad.<br/><br/>This movie is not suspenseful in the least. Don't tell me you were hanging by the edge of your seat, because you probably weren't. This film is predictable and worse for it. Yes, I understand that it's playing off old action film tropes, and I respect that, but it seems a little bit lazy on the part of the writers (who apparently included Stallone) to shoehorn plot clich√©s in there with no twist or turn to it. The characters themselves also seem invincible to the point of it not being anything of consequence when they get shot. That's another thing, death is treated so nonchalantly that it almost doesn't matter when another mook goes down. Even when an introduced, it's no big deal, because his character hasn't been developed at all. There's no danger involved in this movie, no recovery time, no on the fly medical care. That's what takes away from it, the sense that any time one of our heroes could fall is just not there.<br/><br/>One of the bigger issues in the film is that there's nothing to align yourself to emotionally. To make a good movie, you need a character you can identify and empathize with. Instead we're given simple images- no background story, no nothing. The only one they attempt to do this with is Gunner Jensen, and it even fails to give him some depth. It's awkwardly shoehorned into dialog and the plot; it doesn't make you like him very much, it is there though, which is more than you can say for the rest of the cast. In fact, Gunner is one of the only characters who have lots of characterization between the two films, which is odd considering the fact that he's more or less a background character. We know more about Gunner than we know about Ross, who is supposed to be the main dude! Yes, he's supposed to be mysterious and shell-shocked or whatever, but it wouldn't kill to have even a short flashback sequence, ala First Blood. <br/><br/>That brings me to my next point. The movie was made to be a homage to old action movies, that's really the whole point of it. The issue is that you cannot enjoy this film without background knowledge and its worse for it. If you don't know why the hell Arnie is saying ""I'll be back"" for the 90th time, it's not funny (though whether it would be in the first place is debatable...) because you don't understand why it isn't funny. I'm not saying that all films should try to cater to everyone who watches them, but the in jokes aren't very amusing. If we wanted to watch Arnie say ""I'll be back"", we'd pop in a copy of the Terminator, right? Though the film takes inspiration from the golden era of Action films, it shouldn't be dependent on all its one liners from those movies. It takes away from the character, it yanks the character away and all we see is the actor. Many of us probably watched these movies for the actors, yes, but the reason why we liked these guys in the first place was because of the characters they portrayed. The actors were bigger than the characters and that's where the film falls flat. It wouldn't kill to put something new in there, yet when I watched this movie I saw nothing new, just recycled bits and pieces. It's almost embarrassing and definitely cringe worthy. <br/><br/>This movie attempts to prove that these older men don't have their action careers completely behind them, yet it cannot do anything but look back.<br/><br/>Why aren't I giving this film 1 star and calling it a day?<br/><br/>To me, this movie was almost endearing. It's almost like when your kid comes up to you and has drawn the most terrible thing ever, and you still like it because, hell, its your kid. That's how I feel about this, Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis, Crews, all of them, while not the best actors on the Earth, got together and made a film and you gotta give them something for that. It was full of fighting mooks and explosions, aptly baddie Russians with Satan tattoos, and hand to hand scenes that will probably make you roll your eyes rather than root for the good guys. Yet somewhere deep inside I can't bring myself to hate this film even if it is a bad movie. You won't get a laugh out of the things that make this movie bad, and you'll indefinitely feel embarrassed by some of the character's actions, but it's a good watch just to say you watched it. <br/><br/>Stallone is old and looks like his face was put together by several wax figure makers, Norris dyes his beard, Schwarzenegger spent his last ""action hero"" days in the Governor's chair, yet he's still here. Something about that makes me respect them, even if it is a little bit pathetic. That being said, I wouldn't pay one red cent to see this movie and neither should you, if you can avoid it."

","OLD is certainly not gold in the second film about the exploits of a bunch of mostly white geriatrics.<br/><br/>Stallone, Willis, Lundgren, Norris, Statham and Schwarzenegger collaborate with Jet Li and Chinese actress Nan Yu to show that they are at their best knocking off villains.<br/><br/>Van Damme appears as a baddie. I had the opportunity to interview him over the phone, when he was in the US, about his flick, Legionnaire, in 1998.<br/><br/>The exertions really show on the faces of Stallone, Willis, Lundgren, Schwarzenegger and Van Damme. While they have kept up their pumping, it's hard to believe that they actually ran, jumped, kung-feud, jumped and whacked dozens of baddies, with nary a scratch on them.<br/><br/>Stallone, as we all know, got caught carrying 48 vials of human growth hormone in Australia in 2007. So we know that his musculature isn't natural.<br/><br/>The opening scene signals the level of preposterousness that the film will go to show how ""bad"" these mercenaries are. They storm a Nepali rebel hangout and blow off the heads of practically all the guards.<br/><br/>Then it gets mushy by talking about a mercenary (Hemsworth) wanting to leave the killing business to be with his French girlfriend. How sweet.<br/><br/>The mercenaries illegally enter hostile territory in Albania to recover a radiation-detecting device (huh!!??), which leads them into the hands of mon ami Van Damme.<br/><br/>Van Damme grabs the device from them and stabs the young mercenary in the heart with a vicious and startling kung-fu move.<br/><br/>This gives the mercenaries permission to track down the baddies, wipe them out and save a town devoid of its men and male teens.<br/><br/>When Van Dame's character kills the mercenary, viewers know that he will get his just desserts, and in a similar fashion, at the end of the flick.<br/><br/>The baddie's right-hand man also gets into a war of words with Stallone's right-hand man, Statham, so you know what will happen to the baddie's aide.<br/><br/>There's some mild, fake excitement caused by the mercenaries attempting to remove the device from a plane wreckage. The device warns about an explosion, but this trick is so common in movies that viewers will know that it will all come to naught.<br/><br/>It's quite incredible for the baddies to detain the men and teens without the European Union knowing anything about it. How is this possible? If the EU had known about it, it would have been its forces storming this peaceful enclave.<br/><br/>But the flick can't have that. This is a common theme in US movies; it's the modern-day variation of the cavalry coming to the rescue.<br/><br/>Also, why would Russia have left the nuclear capsules in a cave? Wouldn't they have put them in a secure, high-tech installation? And how is it possible for the baddies to transport the capsules without wearing protective clothing?<br/><br/>The actors may have gotten older, but they have not gotten wiser."

","'THE EXPENDABLES 2': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone and the rest of the all-star action heroes that starred in the 2010 blockbuster (Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture and Terry Crews) reprise their roles for this sequel and they're joined by newcomers Jean-Claude Vann Damme, Chuck Norris, Scott Adkins, Nan Yu and Liam Hemsworth. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis (who had cameos in the original film) reprise their roles as well and play much bigger parts this time around. Stallone handed over directing duties to Simon West (director of such popular B action films as 'CON AIR', 'LAURA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER' and the 2011 'THE MECHANIC' remake also starring Jason Statham). Stallone once again co-wrote the film though, this time with Richard Wenk, Ken Kaufman and David Agosto. If you're a fan of the original and action films in general you're almost sure to enjoy this action lover's dream! <br/><br/>The story revolves around Barney Ross (Stallone) and his crew of mercenaries once again being put on a dangerous assignment by CIA agent Mr. Church (Willis). He tasks them with stopping five tons of plutonium from falling in to the hands of a ruthless terrorist known as Jean Villain (Van Damme). They fail and one of their men is killed. So now it's up to Barney and his men to not only stop Villain and save the world (basically) but also get revenge for their fallen comrade. They find help from a few other rival expendables including Trench (Schwarzenegger) and Booker (Norris).<br/><br/>The film has some amazing action scenes as one should expect featuring the cast it does. The story is once again almost non existent and the pacing a little slow (during the second act) as it's built much like a Bond film; blowing it's wad in the beginning and then building to a powerhouse conclusion while lacking the same kind of thrills in between. The movie does lack Stallone's directing touch as well (he's a much better director than West) but West is more than adequate in the genre too. I was a little disappointed the movie didn't take itself a little more seriously as it's constantly winking at the audience and plays itself out pretty tongue in cheek. Some would say it's more of a parody than an exciting action film and it definitely does have a lot of fun with itself. It you're just excited to see all of these guys together and relive the action genre's glory days you should be more than pleased. It is nice to see Schwarzenneger and Willis with more screen time this time around and actually getting in on the action but it's also a little disappointing to see so little of Jet Li as he exits the film pretty early on due to scheduling conflicts (I think). The opening delivers about everything you paid for in the price of admission though and then there's still almost 90 minutes of film to go. Stallone and Van Damme's fight scene is also one of the highlights of the film as well. Not quite as good as the original but for me and die hard fans it's still 'Nostalgia Heaven'!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh674mS5vTo"
"keith-w8888","3","8","16","22 August 2012"," Body Count is back
","Alright, so skipping over the slight plot irony that after wasting hundreds and hundreds of ethnic Asians they lose one of their own and then have to pursue the perpetrator for vengeance it's the exploding head sniper thing in the opening sequence that takes the humour in this movie to the next level. With an action hero line up like this it is impossible not to enjoy this movie despite its facile plot, jerky continuity and breathtaking offensiveness. Old action heroes don't die, they just need four hours in makeup, muscle suits, shaping underwear and plenty of body doubles to do their stunts and action scenes. Jet Li and Jason Stratham are both still young enough to actually act their parts, but there's one upper body profile shot of Stallone that probably should have been cut from the movie, it is neither for the fainthearted nor the young. It is almost as if you are watching the final twitching of the newly dead corpse of the war action genre, but the greatest tragedy of this movie is that it still finds an audience, albeit an old one."
"Chris_Pandolfi","4","7","14","22 August 2012"," The Next Chapter in Action Pornography
","Watching ""The Expendables 2,"" I was repeatedly reminded of the Julie Brown single ""I Like 'em Big and Stupid,"" a 1980s synthpop novelty song about the inexplicable attraction to muscle-bound men with low IQs. A sample of the opening verse: ""When I need something to help me unwind / I find a six-foot baby with a one-track mind. / Smart guys are nowhere, they make demands / Give me a moron with talented hands."" Rare for song lyrics to apply to a film so naturally. Rarer still that they would also accurately describe the audiences that find such films appealing. Just like its predecessor, ""The Expendables 2"" is pornography for the action film buff ‚Äì a noisy, aggressive, violent, and utterly absurd testosterone fantasy that doesn't have two gray cells to rub together within its extra-thick cranium. If this is what counts for escapism nowadays, we might have actually devolved back into Neanderthals.<br/><br/>There isn't much I can say about this film that I didn't already say in my review of the first ""Expendables."" As before, much of the action is an incomprehensible blur of blood, bullets, and body slams, which is to say that, even if you appreciate that kind of filmmaking, the editing has seen to it that you can't distinguish a lot of it visually. As before, much of the dialogue is a pathetic mishmash of one-liners, macho sentiment, and really bad puns. And as before, the plot is weak and has been manufactured solely as a vehicle for scene after scene of people getting shot and things blowing up. I hesitate to call it an homage to the action films of the '80s and '90s, as the word ""homage"" implies artistry, intelligence, and respect. This movie is more like an extra value meal at a fast food chain; you get plenty to eat but nothing in the way of nutrition.<br/><br/>We're reunited with all of the Expendables, well-armed and well-trained mercenaries. The leader, Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone, also the co- writer), is the only one who was given a normal name. The others didn't fare as well; there's Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), Toll Road (Randy Couture), Yin Yang (Jet Li), and Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), the latter, as his name makes all too clear, being a sniper. New to the film are Billy the Kid (Liam Hemsworth), a young soldier who may not have what it takes to be an Expendable, and Maggie (Yu Nan), a tech expert. Both represent two of the most tiresome action movie clich√©s imaginable. The former, who has a girlfriend living in Paris and dreams of reuniting with her, gives the Expendables an excuse to swear vengeance on the villain. The latter satisfies the need for a female sidekick and provides the teasing possibility of a romance. As to whether or not one actually blossoms, I leave for you to discover.<br/><br/>The plot, if I can even call it that, involves the Expendables going to Albania and butting heads with Jean Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme), a heartless kick boxer who schemes to sell the five tons of plutonium stored in an abandoned Soviet Union mine. The mine operates on slave labor, mostly men who have been kidnapped from a local village. Those who fall out of line are not shown any mercy. It's up to the Expendables to rescue the men and help the village women, who know that Villain will soon come after their children. I realize we're not supposed to question the lack of a language barrier, and if the filmmakers had tried harder to make a better movie, I probably would have overlooked it. As it is, I have to wonder how a group of English-speaking tough guys can enter a destitute Albanian village and just happen upon women who know the language fluently.<br/><br/>In the previous film, both Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger made cameo appearances. For this chapter, they're roles are only slightly expanded. Both are so blatantly at the mercy of the screenplay that it's almost embarrassing. In Willis' case, he's required to be nothing more than a mysterious CIA agent that talks in a menacing whisper. It's even worse for Schwarzenegger, who's forced to be annoyingly self referential, especially at the most inappropriate times. Rest assured, his immortal line, ""I'll be back,"" works its way into the film several times. He and Willis will eventually argue over it, promoting the former to mutter, ""Yippee kai yay,"" under his breath. At one point, he even says, ""Who's next? Rambo?""<br/><br/>That line is prompted by the sudden appearance of Chuck Norris, who enters almost every scene he's in with the main title from ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" playing on the soundtrack. He plays Booker, a sniper who was rumored to be dead. Not that the name of his character matters; ""The Expendables 2"" is nothing if not a self-congratulatory exercise in all things action packed, which is to say that Norris' appearance will be appreciated at face value and nothing more. I think the greatest failure of this film is that it could never be a complete entertainment or a complete parody; it exists in a gray area somewhere between the two. Had the filmmakers had the courage to make it one thing or the other, maybe it would have been halfway decent. As it stands now, it's only suitable for those that like their movies big and stupid.<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"
"joebloggscity","3","6","12","23 August 2012"," Silly violence but fun that is intentionally bad but Dolph is cool
","Before I start I'll be honest to say that I don't mind the odd silly violent testosterone fuelled movie. Jason Statham movies are guilty pleasures for many like me.<br/><br/>Anyhow, this is a sequel to a movie that I've not yet seen but it doesn't seem to matter. Story is irrelevant and all that matters to know is that we are watching our batch of ""heroes"" set out to beat up Jean Claude Van Damme.<br/><br/>Dumping Jet Li early for fear he would begin to speak English more clearly than the rest of them as the movie progresses, we get little more than explosions, in-jokes, silly cameos, loads of blood and plenty of plot holes. Who cares though? It is in intentionally bad and stupid, and is just nostalgia for the old couch potatoes from the 80s & 90s video days. This film is also about the movie poster and the easy cash it can bring in, and we all know that so it's honest at least (unlike that ""John Carter"" movie director who tried to claim some kind of artistic merit for his film). Personally, I thought this was passable enough but send a bunch of guys together to watch it and they'll be thoroughly entertained.<br/><br/>If anyone truly wishes to sit and damn the movie for any artistic merits then don't bother. All you'll need to say is that Dolph Lundgren was the best actor with the best lines (and is the most fun character) and all will get the idea."

","After I have seen the trailer I had certain expectations and I thought this sequel must be great. The many positive critics here influenced me too. I was wrong and at the end a little disappointed. Why? At the beginning and in the last part there are good action scenes. But between there were only tons of cheap and bloody shots what was really not necessary. The story is a bit better than in the first Expandable but nothing new so far. It was interesting to see all the stars together. They told lot of good jokes where I had to laugh. So my advice is if you have no choice at the theater watch this otherwise it's a not must see. 6/10. Watch instead Rambo 4, Terminator 3 or Die Hard 4.0 (read my critics)."

","The cast of this film is fantastic, I loved some of Chuck Norris' lines, for example: Stallone ""heard you got bitten by a cobra."" Norris ""yeah, but after five days of agonising pain the cobra died."" The main problem with the film is that it had no plot. I watched this after seeing number one again and their is no doubt in my mind that the first was superior. Added to this Arnold Schwarzenegger is terrible. The characters constantly use their old catch phrases like yippee-ky-ay (spelling?) and I'll be back etc. <br/><br/>All in all I found it very corny and all I wanted was Jet Li to have more screen time. Saying that the action was great and I thought Stallone and Statham were great and old Van Damme was not bad either."

","There are many times that I have gone to see an action movie and was really disappointed in how over the top it was. Unnecessary explosions, ridiculous amounts of gunfire, and violence crammed so far down your throat it is impossible to digest it all. You go to see what you think will be a standard action movie complete with a decent story, and instead you get a special effects or action reel that would be better as a montage of action scenes smashed together and put on YouTube.<br/><br/>However, there are other times when you go to see an action movie and you are fully aware what you are getting yourself into¬Öand the film doesn't disappoint in letting you partake in a bloodbath that is only meant for skin deep enjoyment; something we can all use every now and then. The Expendables 2 is a perfect example of a film you go to for mindless action, and gives you everything you asked for.<br/><br/>Not just presenting, but celebrating a cast that includes Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, Terry Crews, Chuck Norris, Bruce Willis, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Liam Hemsworth, and Jet Li, The Expendables 2 is a mash up of all these action heroes once again giving us a powerhouse of old stars and ridiculous action.<br/><br/>Let's take the opening scene as the best example. We have Stallone, Statham, Lundgren, Couture, Crews, Li, and Hemsworth on a mission with heavy guns, tanks, bombs, and planes to rescue Schwarzenegger's character, who is being held captive by an enemy that we don't even know. Who are they? Who cares. They are shooting at our heroes, and they are going to pay for it. Dozens of bodies, several huge explosions, and two Terminator references later, our heroes have saved the day and are off to a bar to celebrate.<br/><br/>It makes it almost impossible to write a review for a movie that must be seen to be believed. Reading words on your computer screen will never do justice to watching a 65 year-old Stallone firing heavy artillery machine guns into crowds of enemies and civilians in an airport. You read that right. Sometimes there is no avoiding collateral damage, and when Jean-Claude Van Damme's posse of goons is storming through an airport, there isn't time to clear out civilians from the crossfire.

","No plot, terrible CGI . It made Willis look like a bitch, it brought back Arnold only to saturate him in cheesy one liners that you could see from a mile away. I literally felt like I had watched this movie before while sitting there. I predicted the outcome of every scene that unfolded. I was only surprised once. It had no suspense for me because it was so predictable. The old airplane needs to pull up or it will crash type of thing over and over again. It doesn't take a genius to know they are going to clear the building in the airplane...No suspense, boring...<br/><br/>This movie lacks any true originality and it offers few surprises.<br/><br/>The solo careers of these actors have infinitely better films, plots, out of Bollywood. Hollywood is getting really cheap, redundant and unoriginal. This movie felt unexciting , uninspired.<br/><br/>The cast and crew didn't really shine, they didn't have any really radiant moments on screen, though a terrific cast they had their on screen charisma , and charm it was mostly wasted to a terrible script that had no plot, non stop action with little substance , suspense.<br/><br/>This movie offers no real thinking, surprises. It's rather sort of dull and there's nothing really remember able about it.<br/><br/>Especially the performance of Van Damme, who is a life time martial artist professional who gets so screwed at the end of the movie. He gets a death that is so weak and pathetic where he is basically treated like a submissive weak cast member and succumbs to death willingly . Stallone's ego is clearly in your face this movie and this old Van Damme , Stallone fall out is penned out. We're pretending FFS , whatever goes on between them shouldn't be on screen. It was like he succumbed to Stallone and was dominated and violated . It was terrible.<br/><br/>Just because it's Hollywood that doesn't make it good. The writing was atrocious and the characters were SILLY, they made chuck Norris look like a live action hero clown...I kid with you not when he showed up the good ,the bad and the ugly played for some bizarre reason . I was expecting him to have a clown nose or walk on water...<br/><br/>I could feel people around me cringing, but the blissful just laughed...the entire movie ...especially when people died...violently which can be entertaining but these people were gasping for air the entire movie. And that made me die a little inside...<br/><br/>They had horrible writing, cheesiness throughout, the CGI was so cheap...<br/><br/>If you want to see good films with these actors look to their independent careers, even see Bollywood. This was not a very good movie.<br/><br/>People argue it's the 80s, it's not the 80s anymore and this is a satire on films. Silly stupid fun action adventure movies in reality date back to the 60s if not sooner. This movie is just on another level of stupid and mindless , even than the 80s. And it has these horrific jokes that will give me nightmares where they reference real life and other films in the middle of major action sequences...Get on with old and goofy , we all like your films, PLEASE act in this one, don't talk about the good old days of your life, career in the real world . Did you forget your medication, you're filming a damn movie! I don't even know what to make of that, but it was done so poorly.<br/><br/>It was Van Damme's big return and they couldn't even put their egos aside to give him a decent fight scene. 3 Round house kicks in a row and then basically down hill from there, couldn't spread it out, make it more dramatic? FFS we're all pretending here, give us our money's worth. It was a horrible Van Damme movie... it makes Derailed look like a better movie ...<br/><br/>I was so disappointed."

Here it goes.<br/><br/>All the characters are not well developed they merely serve a certain purpose the rest of their lives is empty and lonely. I'm not watching Stallone or Li I'm watching the characters and what story they have to tell. You don't get that here at all- disappointing. They went on the hype and produced a very ambitious film, and it's overwhelming the number of superstars jam packed in it. I got the assembled part, but I don't get the plot it's very flat and straight forward. The only team member with a real story gets killed, off course you'll feel for him it's the oldest trick scriptwriters use to toy with the audience's emotions.<br/><br/>There are too many coincidences things just happen before you know it's over. The trilogy shall not work if they repeat themselves. I enjoyed it and that's how my analysis went."

","Stallone, Statham, Lundgren, Li, Couture and Cruz. Check! Schwarzenegger and Willis in tow. Check! Also starring Jean-Claude Van Damme as the villain and with a special guest; CHUCK NORRIS!!! Judging by the first film, I expected this to be the film that delivered more of what I expected the first time around - a bigger budget, a bigger adventure, more hardcore fights and an better script. And that is what I got.<br/><br/>It seems that Stallone has gone back to the start for real since his final Rocky outing - doing everything on a more independent level. He did the same with the final Rambo instalment too and then with Expendables. I'm guessing that Hollywood doesn't want to touch him so much now because of his age but that is what this film is about in many respects. Especially with Chuck Norris now over the age of 70, these veterans are proving - like Danny Trejo is now doing in his late 60's - that they can do what any young action star can do, if not more, with their experience and attitude towards hard work. And this sequel goes to show just how much hard work they were all willing to input.<br/><br/>Every single action star included in Expendables 2 puts in more than they did the last time, including Schwarzenegger and Willis. And then Jean Claude Van Damme has proved that he can still fight just as hard as he did in Kickboxer and Bloodsport.<br/><br/>Not only that but those that didn't get so much dialogue to prove themselves, Lundgren and Crews especially, get to lighten the tone a lot more. The addition of Liam Hemsworth as Billy the Kid was a welcome offering of young blood also but the camaraderie between all the mercenaries is so evident this time that it is more fun to watch when there is no action fill. It is easily noticeable that Stallone had well-known trivia about his cast written into the dialogue as an injoke between characters; spot them if you can.<br/><br/>I would welcome a third and final instalment. There is no end to the possibilities that await but I would be happy to see a few more action legends pulling merc or villain duty.<br/><br/>E.g. Danny Trejo, Michael Biehn, Thomas Jane, Lance Henriksen, Michael Jai White... just sayin'..."

Who cares about the plot the lack of character development(we all know them, so that would be a waste of time) - I know I never did in the 80s. There is plenty of one liners and humour and all of them making a point of not taking them selves to seriously. Each character has there moment of displaying there kind of fighting style(which can be more than said for the Avengers).

","Entertaining, enjoyable. A 2012 movie but with an 80's taste. No CGI , no computers, just old-fashioned special FX and a bunch of 40, 50, 60 and even 70 years old actors who still can do action movies, believe it or not. This group of old geezers make fun of all their previous movies, The action sequences are very well made. Of course that the plot is as simple as A B C but as you all know The Expendables 2 is a movie not intended to make you think, its only intention is to make people spend a good time with a spectacular and adrenaline-pumping action-packed extravaganza and that's just the way this movie should be seen. In conclusion, The Expendables 2 is an enjoyable movie with good old-fashioned, entertaining and mindless violence."

","Every single aspect of this movie screams of Hollywood. Down to the smallest details it does not take an expert to tell this is a classic action movie in pure Hollywood spirit. <br/><br/>We follow a crew of five-six unbeatable, super-humans that could kill a guy just by twisting his little finger while screaming ""yippie kay yay"". Their mission is to bring back an object that could be deadly in the wrong hands, but on their journey they bump into some bad guys (surprise surprise). The bad guys leader is also as straight forward as you think. Ice cold, but with a sense of humour, that doesn't mind killing to get what he wants. <br/><br/>The most impressive about this movie is the cast. It's quite impressive how many star actors they managed to gather. But it does not help save this movie from being something out of the ordinary. We've seen it all before. A main character that is both a good guy and a bad guy at the same time. I'm sick of movies like this, which follows the old, well-used path to making an action film. It simply fails in entertaining.<br/><br/>The only reason for you to watch this movie is you have to love the old Hollywood aspect of movie making. Sadly, I've seen enough, and I'm starving for something new and innovative.<br/><br/>Overall: 5/10"

","This is actually better than the original, more action and great moments with Stallone and the guys.<br/><br/>Jet Li is only in the film for 10 minutes but has a great fight scene at the start which is good to see as he didn't actually had so much chance at showing it in the first film (except for the little moments when he fought Dolph Lundgren).<br/><br/>Jean Claude Van Damme stars as the villain literally named Jean Villain. He proves in this film that he can actually make a good bad guy, shame that he doesn't have much screen time as the rest of them. Scott Adkins made a good henchman, not surprising that his character works for Van Damme, he seems to appear in a lot of Van Damme's DTV stuff recently.<br/><br/>Well worth watching if you love 80s and 90s action films and obviously if you loved the first film.<br/><br/>I hope they make more Expendables films, Dwayne Johnson and Jackie Chan seem interested in roles.

","The Expendables 2 is a wildly fun action comedy to finish off the summer blockbuster season. The cast is incredibly charismatic, With Schwarzenegger and Norris finally making some hilarious appearances. Nan Yu is the only part of the cast that is strange; she is a double edged sword. While her moves are brutal, but her acting is static. The action is very well orchestrated, featuring incredible shooting galleries and fisticuff fight sequences. It's everything you've seen before, but nothing on the same scale. While the plot is fairly simple and there are some pacing issues, there's no reason to pass up on this action adventure. It's packed with awesome action, has tons of great jokes and one-liners, and features memorable performances from the colorful cast of characters.

"jdkraus","9","4","8","22 August 2012"," More destruction, more death, more laughs, more fun
","You'd think a sequel to something like ""The Expendables"" would be nothing more than a repetitive rendition of the original‚Äîendless shootouts, big explosions, cool fight scenes, and wisecrack one-liners. To be honest, it is. This does not make the movie bad at all. In fact, it is an improvement from the first one, specifically with the technical aspects‚Äîthe hand-held camera is removed, night scenes are kept to a minimum, the dialog is clearer, and the quick cuts of action move much more fluently. In short, Director Simon West brings us a more visually pleasing film to watch versus Stallone (sorry Rambo).<br/><br/>The plot is simple: the expendables take on a job that results in the death of one of their own and they go on a destructive journey to seek revenge. There are some cute tie-ins of this film and its predecessor, but the story is presented as its own. A viewer can watch this without having seen the prequel. What I really enjoy about this Expendables more than the first one, is the extension of the cast. There are some new faces: Liam Hemsworth and Nan Yu are the new team members of the expendables. Both add subtle diligence to their respective roles, especially Hemsworth, who in one scene relates a story about how his last tour in Afghanistan went to hell in a handbag. For an action film, this is very poignant. <br/><br/>Chuck Norris makes two big appearances, and they still show that he is the man to blow stuff up. Scwarzenegger and Willis's roles are vastly extended from mere cameos. It is humorous to watch as they exchange spoofs on themselves as well as unleash mass destruction in an airport while driving a very small car. Jean Claude Van Damme plays the villain, whose character is coincidentally named Villain. It is neat to see him be the bad guy for a change. His thick, dark jacket and stunning sunglasses gives him the appearance of a villain in one of his past movies, but his suave way of talking and his cold-hearted behavior says otherwise. The only downside is that he does not have enough screen time to be a truly great villain‚Äîits almost as if he is intentionally kept at arms length, like Blofeld in Bond. The screenwriters at least had the courage to give him a final showdown with Stallone. The man can still jump high and make a mean kick (at least on-camera). <br/><br/>""The Expendables 2"" is violent, intense, and moves quickly like the characters in a battle zone. There is a higher body, more explosions, more laughs, and more actors at play. In conclusion, ""The Expendables 2"" is more fun."

"ghost_dog86","8","4","8","21 August 2012"," Things explode¬Öagain.
","""The Expendables 2"" gives fans exactly what they came to see, more cartoonish, exploitive, action movie fluff (by means of explosions and guns) more laughable (but utterly ridiculous) one-liners, and overall one of the most immensely entertaining action movies of the year. Directed by Simon West (Con Air, The Mechanic) and written by Richard Wenk and Sylvester Stallone (who also stars in the film) ""The Expendables 2"" is a much better version of its predecessor, simply because this time around the filmmakers are even more aware of the campy atmosphere which surrounds this (soon to be) franchise; and so they lay everything (the gunfire, the bombs, the kills) on thick (metaphorically winking after every bad pun or post-kill one-liner). And the fact that they took the camera out of Sylvester Stallone's hands and let West (a director who knows his way around an action movie) run the show only helps makes ""The Expendables 2"" that much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Plot: The usual suspects are all back, including the likes of Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Stallone (who officially looks like a bulldog) as Barney Ross. And this time, this rag tag group of senior citizens (The Expendables) find themselves going head to head with a villain, comically named Villain, who is played by Jean-Claude Van Damme. Oh, and to make things even better, there's also a cameo from the one and only Chuck Norris. Anyway, in this sequel The Expendables mission is¬Öwell, who really cares. All one really needs to know is wherein ""The Expendables"" things blew up, in ""The Expendables 2"" things continue to blow up plus heads blow off. Actually the male-centric, ""things blow up"" perception a film like this reeks of may be the most interesting misconception at work here. From the trailers (and ""The Expendables"") one would think a movie which sees a seemingly never-ending barrage of constant explosions would become rather boring or mind numbing (as with any Michael Bay film) West, Went and Stallone have succeeded in consistently keeping its audience on their toes by not relying on explosions alone to entertain. When the explosions become too repetitive in a finite period of time, a few laughable one-liners are thrown in, and when the one-liners get old, there is a cameo thrown in, and so on and so forth until the film's climactic and testosterone infused battle.<br/><br/>Yes, most of the special effects used here are ridiculously bad, the film is filled with moments of very dry exposition which slow it to a halt and the melodramatic bromance banter delivered from the plastic surgically enhanced lips of Stallone are cringe inducing at best. But in saying that, there are more than enough well inserted cameos (Chuck Norris tells a Chuck Norris joke!) very entertaining, over-the-top/explosive scenarios and tons of ""it's so bad that it's good"" laugh out loud moments, that if you don't find yourself smiling throughout at least 80% of ""The Expendables 2"", then my consensuses (as a self-anointed critic) would have to be that: YOU HATE FUN! The Dialogue: When I made mention that there is laughable dialogue throughout this film (no matter how self-aware it may be) I may have been selling ""The Expendables 2"" short. This film is built on a foundation of constant, laughable and very clich√© zingers (maybe breaking the record for the amount of one-liners used in a single film) which in any other film would have had any normal person's eyes rolling so much so, they could be mistaken for someone in the middle of a seizure, but this dialogue works because it was tailor-made for this film. I would go so far as to say that amidst the overly campy tone, the dialogue itself is so perfectly self-aware of its own mockery of bad 80's action films, that in the confines of an exploitation film such as this, the Wenk and Stallone script can be seen as a very well written satirical piece.<br/><br/>Final Thought: I can see how some people can hate the ""my gun is bigger than yours"" mentality that a film like ""The Expendables 2"" brings to the table, but on the other hand, this is not a movie that tries to mask what it is. It is an exploitive action throwback on steroids, and proud of it. Again, it's that self-awareness which in and of itself allows this film to maintain its high entertainment value against a seemingly predictable plot. So now, the only question that remains is: Who will be the next aging action star to make a cameo in ""The Expendables 3""? <br/><br/>Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

","The Expendables are back and in action working another job for Mr. Church (Willis) when something goes wrong on the job and the crew vows revenge. (No real plot necessary) This is one of those few exceptions in the world of movies where the sequel is actually better than the original. The Expendables was quite serviceable in my opinion, but it never really lived up to the potential of what could have been with the dream team cast it touted. This time however The Expendables take on a whole new attitude.<br/><br/>By embracing the films true nature The Expendables 2 makes a love letter to the action movies that bred it as well as the fans that grew up watching. You spend just as much time laughing as you spend in awe of the films face offs and graphic action sequences. Everybody is ragging on one another in such a self aware way that you feel like you are in on the joke too, especially if you were a fan of the genre in its hay-day. Gunner (Lundgren), playing the half drunk badass is intentionally funnier than I ever could have imagined. There was one hilarious line by Chuck Norris that actually brought the theater into all out applause. I've never seen that before. <br/><br/>Although the movie had a few short ""Where did the action go?"" moments to instead hone in on a pointless character called Maggie who needs her action fix and is forced on the guys by Mr. Church, the action sequences were over the top and just as much fun as one would hope. There were some Rambo-like graphic gun shots putting gigantic holes in bad guys, sometimes knocking their entire heads off. The hand to hand combat was creating lots of ooh's and ahhs from our theater (rightfully so), and the dream one on one matchups reach a new high as two of the biggest names in ass kicking face off at one point. Van Damme as Villain is sinister enough to be a believable bad guy and fits the role quite well, although I'd rather have seen a bit more of him. (He's JCVD for crying out loud)<br/><br/>Whether fighting, shooting, or talking The Expendables 2 works for the same reason The Avengers did. Watching The Avengers I thought ""This is what it would really be like if these epic Superheroes fought together "".The same goes for The Expendables 2. I just watched John McClane, The Terminator, Ivan Drago, Frank Duux, and Rambo either work together to blow stuff up or even face off against one another. In the first film that's what I expected but The Expendables was trying to be its own movie. The Expendables 2 however, was every 80's and 90's action film we have ever enjoyed wrapped into one and a reminder that having a good time at the movies is what it's all about."

"furiousneon","10","5","11","19 August 2012"," An action fans dream. Surpasses the original in every way.
","First off, I grew up watching Stallone, Van Damme, Schwarzenegger, Willis, Lundgren, etc. For the people who did not and disliked this movie and the first one, I understand. But for any die hard action movie fan of the late 80's and early 90's, this film is it. The one we always wanted. The one that answers most of our what if's when it comes to this genre. The first Expendables was a mean, fun little beast of a film. I applaud Stallone for what he did with it. But no matter how many times I watched it, I always felt more could have been done and this time, more was. Stallone handed directing duties over to Simon West and from the first frame you can tell this film is more polished. The action is amped up, the effects are of higher quality, the humor is timed better. Its all quite an improvement over the first. The film revolves around Sly (he did after all write the script). Willis and Schwarzenegger both have bigger roles this time around (loved the cameos in the first, but felt like it was all just a big tease). Statham plays right hand man to Stallone again while the rest of the crew do exactly what they did in the first with the addition of 2 newcomers (Hemsworth and Yu) and a solid, hilarious extended cameo from Chuck Norris. Statham is always a pleasure to watch, his action scenes are always explosive and he does not disappoint this time around but I especially enjoyed Lundgren and his character. He was funny, literally, not unintentionally and you can clearly tell that he is relishing this opportunity. Stallone gave all of these guys very little at the core as far as character, but I believe that was the point. We want to see them as who they are and who we love them for being and Sly knows that. That might even be why in the first one, Mickey Rourke's (who is absent from the sequel) emotional scenes seemed so out of place. They were phenomenal and truly moving and in reality, had no place in a movie like The Expendables. But since we are speaking of character, the best performance in this film by far belongs to Jean-Claude Van Damme. Its obvious to anyone familiar with his early work that his acting his improved tremendously and he uses this film to showcase that. His character is ruthless and evil in a fun way. He literally demands your attention when he is on the screen and the final fight between him and Stallone is almost perfect (wish it lasted a little longer, but not complaining). The first 30 seconds of the fight had me immediately smiling thinking to myself, am I really watching Rocky Balboa and Kickboxer go at it right now? It was just great. And Stallone, Van Damme and everyone else involved knew that many moments in the film would have you smiling, thinking exactly that to yourself. Are you really seeing this? Yes, you are. A bunch of broken egos finally came together to please the audiences that have dished out millions to continuously see them punch, kick and shoot their way through films. They all shoot high this time. And they hit the mark. 10/10. Not based on if it will an Oscar or not, but based on the tremendous amount of fun that I had with this film. Go See it."

It is a 93 min mess of a film with too many actors, to much comedy, poorly directed and poorly edited.<br/><br/>I Love Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris in this movie, but it dosen't gave me an impact on me like the first movie did. I felt Van Damme and Norris voice is dubbed I know their voices, but from time to time they don't talk like they do in their own movies. The music when Norris appears you hear that soundtrack from Ennio Morricone - The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) the soundtrack that was used on Eastwood's character. Norris just dosen't act that way in his own movies. I don't like Shwarzenegger dressed as T-800 as The Terminator kreep saying his catch praise ""I will be back."" I don't like Bruce Willis using Schwarzenegger catch parise You were be back enough and than Scwarzenegger uses Willis catch praise from Die Hard ""yippee ki yay."" I am sorry it is just not funny. I don't like or appreciate those two action stars make fool out of them selfs. They are better action movies than The Expendables 2.<br/><br/>Van Damme I am a huge fan of Hard Target it is a serious action movie, or Stallone's Cobra (1986) it is a serious action movie. Van Damme refused to do on the first Expendables movie. Stallone did not know what Van Damme's character would be so Stallone told Van Damme he would paid a lot of money and Van Damme refused too do so. Because he does not care for the money. I am huge number 1 Van Damme fan, huge number 1 Stallone fan, but this sequel was a missed opportunity for Sly and Van Damme. The fight between Van Damme and Stallone wasn't serious, Van Damme barely touches Stallone.<br/><br/>The movie is boring and it is terrible digitaly filmed shot. I liked this movie in 2012 and even over the years, but now it changed, it is just depressing movie to me. This movie I don't like anymore. They are better action movies out there like John Wick 1, 2 and 3 are better action movies nowdays than The Expendables 2. I did review this film long ago, so I am just going to stop here Scott Adkind and Jason Statham fight did do nothing for me. It is a good acrion movie could have been better it is still rated - R. I liked the opening sequence but after there the movie, just went down hill for me. Liam Hemsworth as Billy the Kid get's killed does not do nothing for me. It is just not an action film I like.<br/><br/>This is a cheesy another disappointing Stallone flick. Yes I love Con Air (1997) to death better action movie than The Expendables 2. It was directed from Simon West who directed both of the films. Stone Cold (1991) with Brian Bosworth it is better action movie than this sequel just my opinion.

It was good to see that both Willis and Schwarzenegger have bigger roles this time around. Jean Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris make very good additions to the cast. They all may be old, but they are still good enough to pile on a pretty hefty body count.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one action-packed sequel and it effectively pays homage to the old-school action films of the 80's and 90's. This film is also has some funny moments here with all the witty one-liners that appear often and they got a few chuckles out of me. If you come in looking for nonstop action, then this is the movie for you. I rate this film 9/10."

","When I reviewed ""The Expendables"" back in 2010, I cited it as proof that Sylvester Stallone is truly getting better with age - just like that old saying about aged wine - because it seems (in my opinion, at least), that some of the films he's made in the last seven years are much better than anything he did at the height of his fame in the '80s and '90s. ""The Expendables"" is setting out to be a full-fledged all-star action series, featuring pros young and old - mostly old - sharing major screen-time together.<br/><br/>Stallone has bowed out of directing 2012's ""The Expendables 2"" - turning things over to ""Con Air"" Simon West - though he still remains the star and co-screenwriter. This sequel, as I expected, is bigger and better than the first film, with a bigger cast of pros young and old. The story here is pretty simple and can be summed up as follows. It basically concerns old-school mercenary Barney Ross (Stallone) and his team looking to take down an international arms dealer named Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme, turning in one of the most menacing villain performances in recent memory) and his small private army as they look for weapons-grade plutonium in Albania left over from the Cold War by the former Soviet Union.<br/><br/>The whole gang is here, too - Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Yin Yang (Jet Li), Gunnar Jansen (Dolph Lundgren), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), Toll Road (Randy Couture), and newcomers Billy the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) and Maggie (Yu Nan); plus there's Church (Bruce Willis), Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger), and Booker (the almighty Chuck Norris!).<br/><br/>The action scenes are incredibly intense and bloody and over-the-top, but are almost comical. The real show, here (for me, at least), was watching Jean-Claude Van Damme playing a bad guy for once, and a truly vile villain at that. He does, by far, turn in the film's best performance and gets into a truly brutal, if anti-climatic, showdown against Stallone's Barney Ross in the film's explosive finale.<br/><br/>""The Expendables 2"" was a long time coming, but it is one of the most worthwhile action films in recent years, from a group of old-school action pros who know their way around how to make a truly a**-kicking action film.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I postponed watching this movie as the original, although good enough to watch, did not give as much 'in your face' OTT as I had hoped. The sequel however delivered this in abundance! The additions of Chuck Norris and Jean Claude Van Damme were a brilliant choice and extended roles for Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger were much appreciated.<br/><br/>This was old school action at its best, guns, bombs, knives and fists took up the best part of the film and the dialogue was perfectly cheesy throwing in a lot of well received references.<br/><br/>This is possibly the most fun I have had watching an action film in my life let alone the last few years. I do understand some people feel the story was lacking and the puns were too much but it adds much more memorability and banter with the lads! I am happy to hear there will be a 3rd instalment and pray that the legends of the genre once again deliver 'a real mans film' (being PC this is just an expression of course, I'm sure many women enjoy this type of film :D). I've missed movies like this as film makers have added a more 'thriller' feel to modern action flicks. SOMETIMES I JUST WANT TO SEE PEOPLE BLOWING SH*T UP!!!<br/><br/>TLDR?: Thoroughly entertaining :)"
"Hatokirei","8","2","3","3 March 2013"," Get what ya expect
","I really enjoyed this movie. For me it's easily better then the first in that there is more action more explosions and better banter. Granted I'm probably one of the few women out there that gets their kicks out of over the top action movies and this one certainly fits the bill. Don't expect there to be too much depth to it, I mean come on....it's a crap ton of actors whose main claim to fame have been kicking, punching and shooting everyone who tries to fight them. If you go in expecting something other then what it OBVIOUSLY advertises itself to be then you may be disappointed. It's mainly rated for blood and violence, lots of heads being shot off or holes being shot through the chests, it's honestly pretty laughable but in a good way. Basically if you want a movie with deep substance....watch something else, this is all explosions, all macho men strutting around and all banter with lots of fun and cheesy references to any actors previous movies."

","This movie was written for the screen by Richard Wenk and Slyvester Stallone, and directed by Simon West. The initial prowess of this film is Action. However, once into the movie the audience becomes aware that something is horribly missing. Halfway through it, one becomes aware of the missing element, youthful vitality. For the past twenty years or so, most of the primary stars in the film have established a solid reputation as an action Hero. The movie is called "" The Expendables "" and follows up on the Prequeal of nearly the same name. The story is action figure driven and set in the old Soviet Union territory where a hidden cache of enriched weapons' grade Plotonium has been discovered with a dangerous mercenary (Jean-Claude Van Damme) and his followers set to remove and sell it to the highest bidder. To stop such a sale C.I.A. Operative Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) extorts a group of highly trained though albeit 'older' and more expendable soldiers to stop them. The film is explosively dramatic with one explosive scene after another and the audience gets to see some of their favorite action stars performing again. Actor like Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Chuck Norris, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger and even Jean-Claude Van Damme as the heavy all perform well. The movie, it's expansive settings, the shoot-em-up scenes are plausible and the acting is interesting and exciting, although a bit 'tonge and cheek.' Still for all it's apparent drawbacks the 'over the hill gang' gives a good account of itself and produces a good film. Recommended. ****"

However apart from that the story is non existent to me I found myself not being able to fully focus on the film inbetween the action scenes for some reason. It isn't enticing enough.<br/><br/>Found myself in stitches when the actors reference all the other one liners from previous movies (ie I'll be back, Yipee-Kai-Yay and Who next? Rambo?)

Characters are all clich√©, and their sad stories about their life is the same. The scene where they sojourn about their past episodes, etc. are all identical to other action movies from the past. It's typical hero stuff, and is not bad, but it would have been better if the story and action had a new tack to it.<br/><br/>All the actors are in great shape and I'm happy to see them in action again.

"Sandcooler","6","2","3","17 December 2012"," Same as the first (and what's the problem with that?)
","To some fans ""The Expendables 2"" has everything that they couldn't quite find in the original, but given that I already liked the original I can't fully agree with this. Some new names were added to the cast, but apart from that it's the same old thing we got to know and love when all these guys were doing it in the 80s. The villain in this movie is called Jean Villain (it's Jean-Claude Van Damme! Yay!), that should probably give you an idea of how serious all these guys are taking it. Van Damme plays him extremely well by the way, he looks just as evil as Eric Roberts did in the first one but to top that of he can actually move. His best scene is his introduction though, where he gets to kill the most obvious cannon fodder character in the history of cinema. The good guys have some fresh faces (I use that term really loosely), the cast is actually getting so crowded now Jet Li has to parachute himself out of this movie early on. If only he had a parachute for Randy Couture, who is always around but still has about two lines in the entire movie. The action scenes (and the movie's nothing but) are pretty much what you can expect from Simon ""Con Air"" West, you'll be cheering in the audience right until the end or until you're ushered out. The helicopter scene is just awesome in so many ways. ""Expendables 2"" makes you hungry for ""Expendables 3"", and that seems to be what they were going for."

And Chuck Norris, please, stop dying your beard.<br/><br/>The action was so constant that it became boring. The dialog was stupid. No chemistry between any of the actors. In Arnold's scenes, he mostly stands and looks at the other actors who actually have lines.<br/><br/>To make this movie work, it would have had to be much, much funnier. If they make another one of these, I hope they hire some comedy writers and find something funnier to say other than re-hashing the one liners from all the action stars previous movies."

Comic book hero style.<br/><br/>And this ""something"" is missing in movies like The Avengers, new Batman movies, Superman ... and so on. They try to be serious. And of course if you fly in a Blue/Red dress ... you can not be serious! Almost all new superhero movies have this obsession with some obscured reality. It just doesn't work.<br/><br/>The Expendables 2 has managed to achieve a special feeling from comic book super heroes. There is no pretense. Just a movie full of clich√©d actions and statements. Finally! That is super hero movie.<br/><br/>What really impressed me is use of myths, jokes, and personality of individual actors from films which are known for.<br/><br/>Chuck Norris represents the jokes that revolve around his name. Arnold Schwarzenegger acts like Terminator (movie), Special Agent (movie) Governor (real life)... and more. Arnold (in the middle of the fight) also mention "" The Rambo"" And definition of Rambo is what? Stallone of course. Leader of the team in this movie and his old rival in action movie scene.

"Vartiainen","Null","2","3","25 September 2012"," Much better than the first
","In my opinion the first Expendables film wasn't bad at all. Rather it was painfully average, which immediately tells you that something had gone wrong, because with that lineup of actors it should have been legendary. It wasn't, but fortunately it was big enough success that they made another one, and luckily Stallone stepped down from directing. Plus the writers seemed to have realized what worked and what didn't, the action was given bit of a boost and the character interactions were improved. All in all this is one of those rare sequels where the flaws of the original are acknowledged and the creative team has learned from their mistakes. We don't see these very often, so this a real gem in that regard.<br/><br/>That being said, this is still not as legendary as it should be. I feel like Stallone still hasn't realized that sometimes you have to go back to your roots. You have to realize just what made you great in the first place. And when it comes to these guys, it's the cheesiness. These movies take themselves too seriously in my opinion. I can realize that this is Stallone's new style, he has shown it before in movies like the latest Rambo and Rocky films, and in those films it actually works, but the whole idea behind The Expendables franchise is a bit cheesy to begin it, so why not take advantage of the fact and go all the way.<br/><br/>Though, in the case of The Expendables 2, they have added a bit of cheesiness. The film is much funnier, for starters. There are a lot more one-liners, the visual jokes (especially in the opening action scene) are hilarious and the characters manage to work off each other much better than before. What's more, the characters feel much more like real people this time around. They feel like a team and everyone gives solid performances. Liam Hemsworth for example is very good in his role as the newbie.<br/><br/>Also, Schwarzenegger and Willis. The scenes with them are some of the best this movie can offer. The one-liners, the sarcasm, the sheer badassery. Gods, I've missed these two.<br/><br/>On the downside there's Chuck Norris and the villain, played by Van Damme. And don't get me wrong, Norris is very good. He's very, very good. I just feel that his cameo went on a bit too long. It should have been one scene, one conversation, but then it just went on and on... Too much good stuff. And when it comes to Van Damme, he's okay in his role, but this just goes to showcase just how important a charismatic villain truly is. Van Damme's character is just a bad guy, nothing more. He was there, he was something of a threat and that's it, unfortunately.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is a good action film. There's still room for improvement and I'm really looking forward to the third part of the trilogy, but as a standalone action film this delivers beautifully. It's action-packed, it has good characters, it has a reasonably good plot, it's funny, it's fast-paced and it has all of your favourite action stars. Recommended."

"zkonedog","6","1","1","8 March 2017"," Lighter Tone = Better Overall Experience
","The first ""Expendables"" film was a ""tale of two halves"": The first half is a jovial get-together of some of the greatest on-screen action heroes of all-time. However, after a rather strange speech by Mickey Rourke, the film turns really serious and loses much of its built-up energy. In the case of ""Expendables 2"", however, the wise-cracking ""buddy"" formula is in place all the way through and it makes it much easier to enjoy from start to finish.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Expendables 2"" brings the old gang of Stallone, Statham, Li, Crews, Lundgren, & Couture back into a caper involving stolen plutonium. This time, however, the group is joined by Liam Hemsworth and Nan Yu. Along the way, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger stop in to beef up their roles from the original, while legendary action icons such as Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme also have important roles. A lot of bullets are expended, a lot of things explode, and a lot of biceps are strained.<br/><br/>Noticed how I didn't mention any actual character names above? That is exactly by design, as in this film franchise all the actors are essentially playing caricatures of themselves (or at least of their former on-screen personas). That is actually what makes the formula work so well, as back in the 80s all these guys were ""competing"" with each other, and now they are all on screen together! The one-liners and male camaraderie are almost worth the price of admission alone.<br/><br/>Why ""just"" three stars as a rating, then? Well, depending on your taste in movies, you may like this one a lot more or a lot less. I'm not a huge fan of pure-action flicks, but at the same time I loved seeing ""the old gang"" get together, so I could enjoy this one (if not at 4 or 5-star levels). If explosions and gunfire are your cup of tea, however, then this one will jump a star or perhaps even two.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Expendables 2"" is a step up from the original that uses a looser, more comedic tone to keep audience interest. Though not personally a huge fan of ""action extravaganzas"", I will come back for ""EX 3"" if it is made."

There's tanks, soldiers, explosions, daring escapes, planes, etc. And it never really lets up there on in.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger feature more than in the first movie so it really is an all star cast.<br/><br/>Like the original Expendables, this movie is completely absurd, lacks virtually any moral compass, and has a shamelessly clich√©d plot, but it's great fun."

"brando647","7","1","1","29 January 2013"," Old School '80s Heroes with Weak Contemporary Action
","By some miracle, THE EXPENDABLES 2 is neither better nor worse than the first movie. I wasn't a huge fan of the original movie but I appreciated what they were trying to accomplish with it. Sylvester Stallone gathered together some of the biggest names in action into one movie and tried to bring back the feel of the classic '80s action movie. The movie had a lot of problems but was just dumb enough to be a good bit of fun. The second movie is more of the same with bigger names in the cast and larger set pieces. The filmmakers have made no effort to improve on the problems of the first movie and, if they had, I think this movie could've been one of the best action movies of the decade. To be honest, if they hadn't brought in more big name action stars to round out the team, I probably wouldn't have been interested enough to give THE EXPENDABLES 2 a chance. With Stallone stepping down from directing duties and handing them over to Simon West, I had renewed interest. After all, the man directed CON AIR. But then again, he also directed TOMB RAIDER. The movie joins the Expendables team as they are completing a mission in Nepal and we are introduced to their newest member, a sniper named Billy the Kid. Team leader Barney Ross (Stallone) is soon approached by CIA operative Church (Willis) about leading a mission into Albania to recover the contents of a safe from a plane crash site. The mission should be simple: lead Church's agent, a woman named Maggie Chan, to the site, recover the goods, and bring it home. The mission falls apart when the goods are stolen by terrorist Jean Villain (Van Damme) and a team member is killed. Now Ross and his team must find Villain to end his evil plans and avenge their teammate.<br/><br/>You can tell from the character names that the writing hasn't improved since the last film. I mean, come on, the bad guy's name is Villain. Villain. Get it? Yeah, I guess it fits right in with other characters like Toll Road and Hale Caesar. The writing in the movie is on par with a high school freshman penning their ideal action movie, complete with cheesy dialogue and groan-inducing one-liners. No offense to Stallone, who wrote the screenplay with Richard Wenk. The man knows action, but his writing leaves a lot to be desired. The tough guy dialogue sounds corny and the emotional moments are forced. For example, there's a quiet moment on the Expendables' plane when we get a bit of Billy the Kid's back-story. He's ex- military and he spills his sad tale of watching all his colleagues die in an ambush; then, to drive the point home, he survives and returns to base to find¬Ögasp!...they'd shot the stray dog he'd adopted. All right, we get it. Billy's the innocent one. He's still got a bit of a soul and a life of violence hasn't hardened his heart yet. I'm sure nothing bad will happen to a character like that in a movie like this. On the topic of dialogue, you can't discuss THE EXPENDABLES 2 without mentioning the ridiculous level of self-referential humor in the movie. Stallone does not want you to forget that these guys are famous action stars and his script does its best to remind you every chance it gets. References to TERMINATOR, DIE HARD, and even the Chuck Norris facts meme from the Internet are included as an ongoing wink and nod to the audience. One or twice, OK. Constant stream of references in the middle of the big end battle? Sort of annoying.<br/><br/>Right, so the movie fails to improve on the writing of the first movie. How about the action? Well, it's still a bunch of CG bullet hits, blood spatter, gunfire, and explosions. You want to recapture the fun of big '80s action? Blood squibs and gasoline bombs are the way to go. Not all this digital stuff. It stands out like a sore thumb. The best action movies are gritty, real, and violent. Not video games. I also wish Stallone would put his characters in danger a little more. Don't make them feel so invincible. It takes some of the fun out of it when we come to the realization that no one's going to get hurt; all the heroes will survive and live to ride off into the sunset in the end. Ross is shot twice in a scene and walks it off. Sure, he was wearing Kevlar armor but you need to make us believe that these guys are one good shot away from a body bag. Put them in danger! You've got a big team there¬Ösacrifice one near the end to remind us these guys are mortals. Otherwise there's no risk! I don't know, these are just my thoughts on what might make the EXPENDABLES a more thrilling action movie.<br/><br/>THE EXPENDABLES 2 is just the same as the first movie. Dumb. Big, dumb action. This one is cool enough to add heavy hitters Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, Chuck Norris, and Jean-Claude Van Damme into the mix. I loved that. Van Damme was an awesome villain (or should I say¬ÖVillain?). He was way more threatening than Eric Roberts and Steve Austin in the first movie. It was great seeing all of these action legends on screen at the same time, fighting side by side. If it had been handled better, THE EXPENDABLES 2 could've been a legend all its own."

Well I originally do not watch likewise films but the other night they displayed it on TV so I thought why not? but it turned out to be a real blood bath but it then turned to be a comedy silliness and I started asking myself ids this the same expendables I saw 2007 on the only 24 hour film channel we had at that time?."
"tyreeewebster","6","1","1","2 January 2013"," Retrospective Reviews- The Expendables 2 (2012)
","After 3 films in his 'rebooted' career', Actor/Writer/Director Sylvester Stallone reassembles with the Earth's Mightiest Anti heroes for the best worst movie of 2012... 'The Expendables 2!<br/><br/>PROS: To start us off, thankfully, the entire cast are back (with the exception of Jet Li) but we also get a host of new characters who just add onto the fun of the movie. The content in the film is less dark than the previous film, but it makes up for it with spectacular action and a fantastic villain named Jean Villain, played brilliantly by Jean- Claude Van Damme. The dialogue in the film is, yes, extremely cheesy, but that is exactly what to expect when you have a film featuring every 1980's action heroes! The film is mostly the team driving from one location to another, fighting people and blowing stuff up. I can't say that there's much of a story but I'll get to that later. The performances from the cast are over- the- top, except for Stallone himself, who plays the whole thing out completely serious, and so he should. We get a small bit of character development but you don't really care, you just can't wait for the characters to mention a movie they were in.<br/><br/>CONS: The villains goal is the most unclear goal I've ever sat through in a movie. But, the basic story is 'VILLAIN KILLS TEAM MEMBER. THEY GO TO KILL HIM.' Done.<br/><br/>Overall, not as emotionally gripping as the first film, but turn your brain off and enjoy!<br/><br/>Directed by: Simon West<br/><br/>Written by: Richard Wenk & Sylvester Stallone<br/><br/>Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Chuck Norris, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, Liam Hemsworth, Yu Nan, Jean- Claude Van Damme, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger"

","The scenes with Bulgarians speaking ware not translated correctly. To be clear, they ware translated completely wrong. The sentences ware completely different. For example at one scene the man was saying: ""Stay. at least we are together."" and the translation was: ""Be brave, we'll be home soon."". Another example can be found here: ""And who are you? Go light candles!"" was translated like: ""Where the hell are they, Priest ? Stay out of the way. ""<br/><br/>Other than that, it was a good movie. It is a good movie to kill some time, but far from a masterpiece. If you like guns, guns and guns, go watch it."

"naxar-fb","3","5","12","29 August 2012"," Poor story ....less fitting with the ACTION scenes
","What should I say a good try no I think this is a good try from the previous one but overall its SATISFACTORY.........1st of all i still not able to understand what is the actual story of this film.......frankly speaking for me its like combining good quality action scenes together in one film. Though the start is good as it quickly comes to action rather than finding any reason to start with it....and also no signs of anyone from the team getting any sort of single injury or a single bullet shot wound in any action part..........common man we are watching team of people with 60+ age its OK they have been superb action heroes in past but please give some reality to the film. Dialogues are sometimes good but sometimes we cant just understand what they wanted to say....... There were also some pop ups from different actors but cant explain it here as it might become SPOILER......but these pop ups didn't make any connections how they showed up like that :-)..... Nevertheless cutting the long story short.........its a better try from the first part but it could be far more better if things would be handled in a sequential way......cast is looking quite OLD specially ARNOLD and Dolph.... But good expressions and acting shown by SLY and van dame.......... My rating is 3 out of 10 mainly because of the OLD GUNS appearance...."
"faithjarrell","10","4","9","25 August 2012"," The Boys are Back in Town
","I try not to get to excited about sequels because they usually just do not have the same passion and awesomeness as the film it follows but this one was an amazing surprise. I was disappointed that Jet Li was so marginalized and that Nan Yu's character Maggie seemed to be more of a place holder. She has maybe 2 fight scenes and only one of those are truly memorable, not due to lack of talent but of camera time. I was hyper happy that touched on Dolf Lundgren's real educational background, my only complaint is that there is a scene in which he attempts to use that intelligence and it quite literally just fizzles out and then Church(Bruce Willis) appears a few moments later in a rather unlikely manner to rescue everyone. In my opinion that should have let Gunner (Dolf Lundgren) have his 15 seconds of wow, it would have added some kudos to his character and it would have been a touch more believable than Church's rescue. Jason Statham (as always!) was absolutely incredible. My only dismay in terms of Mr. Christmas was that he seemed to be more gun heavy than knife suave in this second film. He still rocked hard core regardless of which weapon he wielded and this man was born to do fight scenes but there is just a certain brutal grace in the way he throws knives and that was one of the main things that got me hooked on the Expendables in the first place. The underlying hook that got me addicted to the Expendables films is the witty and sarcastic banter between Christmas and Barney (Sly Stallone). Mostly all of the dialogue between the characters is perfectly done and definitely gives you the sense that these guys have been through a lot together and know each other very very well. I haven't made up my mind about Liam Hemsworth's character ""Billy the Kid"". It seems like his only function in the film was to be the catalyst. He's not in there long enough for the audience to develop any kind of emotional attachment to him and the talk that he has with Barney outside of the bar gives you a gut feeling about what's coming, and then the story he tells Maggie on the plane, they both serve as quick attempts to get your heart in the right place for Billy but the film just doesn't give you the time to do that. My last complaint is Booker (Chuck Norris). His smile seemed to be super-glued in place and for a film that centers around violence he seemed oddly somewhat out of place, he simply did not have the savage, die hard fire of the rest of the characters and I found that a little disheartening because I grew up adoring Chuck Norris. If you go back and watch anything he did in the 80's and 90's and compare it to his bit in the Expendables 2 you will see exactly what I'm talking about. I do like, nay, love that he takes a pot shot at Chuck Norris witticisms in his statement about the cobra, and I love that all of the characters take pot shots at all of the other characters previous films. They did this in the first film as well but the references were much more subtle where as in the Expendables 2 you can't miss them (unless of course you've never seen any of their previous movies). It is a very precious, special, and awesome movie that drags me to a theater to buy over priced tickets and popcorn after standing in a mile long line for half an hour but this is definitely one of those movies and one that I will probably watch a dozen more times before it ever hits DVD."
"gautamhans1","2","3","6","21 April 2013"," Utterly boring ! Mindless action !
","What I thought after reading the reviews was -- ""OMG ! I got to watch this positive-feedback-given movie A.S.A.P."" But all my excitement was wistful. This movie was a total crap. Let me ask you a question. Do you like a movie which moves very fast and is predictable at any point and where even the jokes are bad? I assure of a big NO ! I mean, with this huge cast of Stallone, Statham, Li, Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris and Jean Claude, the director showed us that even such great stars can be used to produce such fail movie. <br/><br/>This sequel to 'The Expendables' is crap and all the good reviews about this movie also.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Don't watch."
"unknown07","1","3","6","21 February 2013"," This is garbage.
","A lot of movies have been at the top of my ""worst movies of all time"" list, but this has just made it to number one. <br/><br/>This is so painful to watch that it took all my self control to prevent me from blowing up my t.v. I don't know what was worse, Chuck Norris making his foolish appearance or Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to talk. Bruce Willis looks like he has some disease. And I could not figure out what the story was with Stallone's eyebrows. He's in good shape but what's up with the face? I thought California had the best plastic surgeons. Oh well. <br/><br/>This movie is so bad and the acting is so terrible that the only ""actor"" who doesn't really embarrass himself is Van Damme. <br/><br/>The only other good thing I can think of is that Mickey Rourke isn't in this movie.<br/><br/>What a cheap piece of crap. These guys have lost what little ability they had back in the 80's. Take away the big budgets and good directors of their past and what you have left is a bunch of pathetic meat heads who want to sucker you out of your money and give you nothing in return. Especially Stallone. Arnold, without his muscles, looks like he should be working at Wal-Mart. It's not sad, it's horrible!<br/><br/>Everyone else in the cast is forgettable, including Statham, who again plays The Transporter, except with a beret.<br/><br/>At least I didn't have to see Mickey Rourke..."
"natecarlson-331-691523","1","3","6","9 February 2013"," Terrible
","You can't expect much from a movie that Sylvester Stallone co-wrote, but this is especially bad. The majority of the actors -- each of whom was famous for films with the usual blend of high action, zero plot -- all seemed to be too old to be in such violent scenarios, and it didn't help that none of them (except maybe for Bruce Willis) was any good at acting. Not even Willis was able to pull off the sort of compelling charters that he portrayed in 12 Monkeys, Looper, or Sixth Sense. In fact the only remotely interesting character, Bill the Kid played by Liam Hemsworth, was killed off in a ridiculous combination of a karate kick and a knife that only a talentless actor like Jean-Claude Van Damme could pull off. If you want to see a combination of carnage, explosions, and awful dialog, this is your movie."
"TheEtherWalk","5","3","6","4 February 2013"," Surprisingly... boring?
","Okay now I didn't expect this movie to have an Oscar-winning script or performances but I enjoyed the first film for what it was, a no-holds barred, fun action blockbuster. Expendables 2 is devoid of fun, and all the action is completely by-the-numbers and listless. Sylvester Stallone is a great action director. Simon West (Con Air, Tomb Raider) is not. I have no idea why Stallone decided not to direct this one but it was a huge mistake. The whole movie is pretty much just hundreds of braindead bad guys getting shot in repetitive fashion for 100 minutes. The first film had energy but this one just drags on and on. Even cameos by Willis, Schwarzenegger and Chuck Norris are pretty much wasted. The climax of the film involves the team shooting up an airport and Statham and some second-in-command bad guy duking it out next to a plane with a giant propeller blade spinning right behind them. Hmm I wonder if someone is going to get chopped up in those blades? Predictable, predictable, predictable. And the final fight between Stallone and Van Damme is pointless and clich√©d, but not enough to even be humorous. The movie actually takes itself too seriously sometimes. And something weird happens at the end. The team is all sitting around the aircraft celebrating, everyone except Yin Yang. Jet Li mysteriously vanishes halfway through the movie and never returns. Did he realize how pointless his involvement with this series was and just walked off the set? I mean he beats up people with frying pans in one scene. That's about the extent of his role. He's Jet Li, not freaking Samwise Gamgee. This whole movie is a huge waste of time."
"kunalkhandwala","7","3","6","31 August 2012"," The icons reload for more mayhem....
","Just as they ram their way into the Nepalese stronghold to rescue a prisoner, it's very clear that Stallone and his mercenaries are here to reload on some bad-ass mayhem. With the patriotic tanks demolishing everything in their way, the Expendables use every machine gun, bazooka, helicopter and rifle at their disposal to overcome the stunned soldiers. If that wasn't enough, the ferocity of the action continues into the jungles and on the river where decapitations, kill shots and explosions cause more damage than rest of the film could afford. A simple rescue mission seems like a full blown War and this excess is truly enjoyable with the actors who themselves are excess in such films at their ages. All of this forms one of the most exhilarating opening sequences that spares no time for breathing.<br/><br/>'Expendables 2' is nothing but a big cannon ball. There is no reason for it, there is no justification for the excess and a single person such as Ironman or James Bond could've achieved the same result. But the point is to cause the mayhem that follows its flight from the cannon and then the explosion. That's quite simply, what the characters do when provoked. These iconic action heroes from yesteryears bring a certain machoism that is ferocious. However, the film's strength is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. Nor do the protagonists. In almost a self-deprecating manner, the actors pick on each other and judge each other worthy of being in a museum. <br/><br/>Director Simon West keeps the plot as bare as a forgotten James Bond film. By eliminating character depth, story building, narration and realism, West focuses on the brute force of the actors as they use guns, bombs, rockets, knives and even brass knuckles. He does succeed to some extent but when the guys seem to become unconvincingly serious, those quiet moments will make you feel lost. Rest of the time, they're joking around and casually slaughtering several armed enemies, all while having fun with the gun. The film is reckless in its pace and ruthless in its action. The bloody carnage is complemented in some sort with the cheeky humor with heroic words coming out in a comical manner from Stallone, Bruce Willis, Schwarzenegger, Van Damme and Chuck Norris. This installment is indeed funnier with Schwarzenegger's one-liners and Norris' frivolous yet bad-ass entry. <br/><br/>Barney Ross (Stallone) sets off on a mission, that is directed by Church (Bruce Willis), to retrieve the coordinates to a lost inventory of plutonium that could be devastating in the wrong hands. Aided by Lee (Jason Statham), Gunner (Dolph Lundgren), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), Toll Road (Randy Couture), Billy (Liam Hemsworth) and Maggie (Nan Yu, who replaces Jet Li), he flies the seaplane half-way around the world and obtains the device only to concede it to Villain (Van Damme), who shrewdly kills Billy and leaves them helpless. Now, while Villain prepares to earn billions by recovering the plutonium, Barney plans a swift and decisive revenge as Churh, Trench (Schwarzenegger) and Booker (Chuck Norris) play their brief roles in assisting the Expendables. ""Track 'em, find 'em, kill 'em""is the simple game plan behind the carnage that follows. <br/><br/>Twenty years after their prime, these action icons can still kick some ass and Stallone ensures that the audience gets their money's worth as he participates in a big one-on-one with Van Damme. Willis and Schwarzenegger spend some time in a Smart car with guns and Chuck Norris consistently appears out of nowhere to save the day. <br/><br/>As long as you know what you're getting into when you buy the tickets, you will have a blast. 'Expendables 2' is better than expected in that sense because it is excessive in its force yet funny as it doesn't take itself too seriously. Throw in Steven Seagal, Nicolas Cage, Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford and Jackie Chan in Expendables 3 and then you're getting some seriously bad-ass mayhem! It maybe dumb, preposterous and over-the-top but with the biggest entertainers in one film, you wouldn't mind one bit. <br/><br/>7.008 on a scale of 1-10."

","Expendables 2 directed by Simon West and a sequel to the 2010's ""The Expendables"" is an excellent action movie.<br/><br/>Although it has a dumb story,but yet Simon West makes this dumb story a fun-filled journey.<br/><br/>Story: The Expendables are reunited when Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) enlists them to take on a seemingly simple job. When things go wrong, the Expendables are compelled to seek revenge in hostile territory, where the odds are stacked against them. Hell-bent on payback, the crew cuts a swath of destruction through opposing forces, wreaking havoc and shutting down an unexpected threat in the nick of time - five tons of weapons-grade plutonium, more than enough to change the balance of power in the world.

"ganeshsubramanian","8","3","6","31 August 2012"," The expendables are back!!
","An ensemble cast has done a great job in this all-out action film. Loved to see the gang of Stallone, Statham, Li, Norris, Hemsworth, Arnie, Willis in a single film. Stallone pulled off an excellent piece of acting this time around by making sure that he's off the directorial responsibilities. The film is packed with highly laughable and smacking one-liners not just from Arnie but also from (almost) everyone in the cast. Great to have come across the Norris memes as well. Would have loved to see more Li in action than just the starting sequence. Not sure whether he would be part of EX3 although it would be great to have him in the 3rd installment. Van Damme did highly well in the role of a villain. Put all together, much better done and executed than the first part.<br/><br/>Got a request for Mr.Stallone. Please do make sure that (Jackie) Chan ends up in the cast of EX3. I absolutely feel that would be the peak in terms of a casting coup for an action film.<br/><br/>My rating is 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>Thanks, Ganesh."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","3","6","31 August 2012"," This is more like it
","When Villain(...yes, they actually named him that... once you get past that, he's actually really, really cool. Van Damme is clearly loving playing the role, and with his grin and black shades, he is the really cool bad guy who you love to hate, and want to see brought down) steals 5 tons of plutonium, the titular Expendables have to find him and stop him before he sells it and it's used. The group(whose members, while still not distinguishing themselves(I think Couture was in this... somewhere in the background, maybe...) beyond their weapon trademark, all have more to do, if they don't get equal screen time... note that several of the icons appear in cameos, showing up when the heroes are in trouble(yes, this one has actual tension), saving them, and disappearing... fine enough to do once, but when they do it a couple of times...) feel far more like war buddies(and when they're joined by the Chinese agent Maggie, she kicks ass and takes names along with the dudes, and they have a ""different but equal(skills)"" kind of gender relationship, which I think is the way to do it), like they've seen a lot of battle together and they have bonded(in the totally straight way, of course), and their macho exchanges, while still goofy(as all the dialog in this is, as it should be), are much more tolerable in this, and in general, balance is the name of the game in this far-superior-to-its-predecessor movie. No half an hour, 45 minute portion with no action, instead, it's sprinkled in healthy doses throughout the entire running time(and this runs very smoothly). You're not bored for any of this, once the plot gets going, which happens mere minutes after the opening mission. Logic is in and out, as to be expected. The change of director(yes, Sly has done great, but the previous entry in this now-series was poor) is a major boost(even if West has barely done anything for 15 years that would qualify him for this...). This is not filmed in extreme closeups with shaky cam, rather, it lets you see what's going on(with maybe three tiny exceptions), and the editing isn't confusing, either. From a technical standpoint, this is quite good. The acting of Willis and Hemsworth is fantastic(...do I really need to talk about the rest of them...? We're not here to see them make compelling speeches), with the latter being one of the several examples of this picture evoking our emotions, getting us genuinely involved(and this goes for one of the clich√©s of this type of flick, I will not say which, and it is impeccable). There is a massive amount of bloody, gory violence, some disturbing content and a little moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to any and all fans of male fantasy 80's entries in the genre. 7/10"

"GenericBadGuy","9","3","6","28 August 2012"," The Cabin in the Woods of action movies
","To all the people who go into The Expendables 2 expecting a cohesive and well constructed plot or something to tide you over until The Great Gatsby comes out, why would you do that? The plot of The Expendables 2... well what plot. There is 5 tonnes of plutonium that the Russain's have left over from the Cold War that they were going to use for a mine and Van Damme wants it, that's it. If your looking for a deep human story, you won't find it here. What you will find however is some SWEET action sequences.<br/><br/>What The Expendables 2 does succeed in is giving you intense, balls to the walls action. You can tell exactly what you are in for from the get go. The Expendables 2 opens with an action sequence with explosions, heads exploding and 50 Cals tearing the holy hell out of everything and Alex smiled a lot, and apparently speaks in the third person now.<br/><br/>The acting is also what you expect. Sly is about as easy to understand as Batman (that's the Christian Bale Batman) speaking through Darth Vader's voice box, Jason Statham still sounds like he should be in The Sweeney and Chuck Norris is every bit as good as he was in Walker Texas Ranger, and I mean that sincerely *coughs*. The irony is the worst actor in everything else he is in, is the best actor in this, and surprisingly didn't annoy me. Yes that's right ladies and gentleman Liam Hemsworth was the best actor in this movie. However, undoubtedly the best part about The Expendables 2 is Van Damme who plays Villain, yes that is his name. His character makes you hate him enough that you want to see Sly go all Rambo on him.<br/><br/>What really shines in this movie, apart from the action, is the humour and the references to each of the actors movies. One of them is in the final scene of the movie when Arnie and Bruce Willis are tearing people apart Chuck Norris joins in and Arnie says ""Ahhh, who's next, Rambo"". My personal favourite is in the Chuck Norris reveal scene when Sly says ""Is it true you we're bitten by a King Cobra"" to which Chuck Norris replies ""Yes it is,but after five days of agonising pain, the snake died"" and I for one personally love that-they got a ""Chuck Norris fact"" in the mix.<br/><br/>The script is every bit as corny in places as you expect it to be. For example in one scene Jason Statham is dressed as a priest and when a group of Villain's goons come in he says ""I know pronounce you, man and knife"" at which point I cringed but that means that the script writer did his job. You can't be like ""oh, I'm going to ding you on the script there buddy"" because they meant for the script to be like that and that doesn't bother me as it was meant to be that way, they cheesiness of the script wasn't unintentional.<br/><br/>Overall The Expendables 2 is exactly what you expect it to be corny, over the top and incredible fun. Is it for everyone, hell no but for the ones who it is aimed at it is the best all out action film of the year and for me anyway the best all out action film I have ever seen"
"dean_oasis_beckton","9","3","6","28 August 2012"," Fantastic action packed adventure for people who love the classics.
","This action packed roller-coaster re-unites the main cast of the first film and brings in some extra testosterone to pump up the muscle with great success.<br/><br/>It opens with a huge blood splattering rescue mission, introducing the good guys doing what they do best, killing people.<br/><br/>As they plough through an army with a heavy duty bomb proof vehicle, rocket launchers and machine guns, there's no doubt that Sylvester Stallone, Dolph Lundgren, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Randy Couture, Terry Crews and Liam Hemsworth alone are going deliver a fun packed thrill ride. Heads explode, limbs fly and water tanks fall, you are instantly drawn into the action.<br/><br/>There's the first of two key appearances by the legendary Arnold Schwarzenegger in the first opening sequence. The few quick one liners he and the others deliver in the scene, pretty much set the tone for a lot of what's to come.<br/><br/>After the adrenaline filled rampage of mayhem, we are shown the now iconic Expendables logo.<br/><br/>With the departure of Yin Yang (Li) just after the first scene, the team is left with the rest of the remaining members.<br/><br/>The Expendables are enjoying time between missions, hanging out in an old town rock n roll motorbike bar. The newest and youngest member of the group, Bill The Kid (Hemsworth), talks to Barney (Stallone) about his new life with the team and how although he has respect and appreciation for them, beneath that it's not for him. During a surprisingly deep conversation, well executed by the actors, a mutual and somewhat emotional bond is made between the characters.<br/><br/>Barney suddenly gets approached by the powerful Mr Church (Bruce Willis), who comes in demanding that it's time to pay him back an overdue favour. In order to settle the score between them, Barney accepts the objective, also burdened with the promise that he takes one of Churches recruits in with him (Nan Yu) and makes sure nothing happens to her.<br/><br/>As the team are en route to the location of the mission, we get some more character development for Bill The Kid as he tells a story of a dramatic event he went through in the army.<br/><br/>While he centers as the emotional backdrop of the film, it doesn't fail to forget that it's a light hearted and comic driven film, with Lundgren giving one of the most hilarious performances of his career. Surprisingly, he knows not only how to show off his action skills, he can deliver comedy like no other.<br/><br/>The Expendables hike through misty woods to their point of location, with Bill The Kid demonstrating his agility by running up a very steep hill. Again, the one liners are thrown in, especially by Stallone and Statham.<br/><br/>During a predictable but tense bomb diffusion scene, whereby Stallone and Crews show off their monstrously impressive strength, praising open two security locked doors so that Maggie (Nu) can get in and work her computer skills, we get a sense that the film is going to deliver a big moment very soon.<br/><br/>Lighting up the screen with his first Hollywood appearance in over a decade, Jean Claude Van Damme appears raw and ruthless. He gives an exceptionally dark performance of his dangerous and fearless character, Villain.<br/><br/>Van Damme delivers his lines with sheer perfection. He is instantly likable as the villain of the film, even though his screen time is limited, his scenes are pulsing with electricity.<br/><br/>After holding the Expendables at gun point with members of his army, Villain punishes them deeply by murdering Billy The Kid right in front of them. The execution of his death is both shocking and surprising.<br/><br/>Now the team are hell-bent on revenge they set out to bring down Villain and his army.<br/><br/>Hiding out in an abandoned army training city, we are enlightened with more comedic and witty dialogue from everybody. Another big action scene takes places at this location and introduces the first appearance of the bearded martial arts hero, Chuck Norris. While his scene is short, it is no doubt one of the highlights of the film.<br/><br/>After taking advice from Booker (Norris), Barney and his group head to a village where there are people fighting for survival in what's left of their once growing community, previously destroyed by Villain.<br/><br/>More carnage erupts as some of Villains army attack the village. An impressive fight scene between Lee (Statham) and a group of soldiers in a church breaks out in a church while blood guts and bullet holes scatter throughout everybody else's encounters.<br/><br/>Now it's time for the action ensemble people have dreamt about for years.<br/><br/>After the Expendables are trapped underground, covered by mass amounts of rubble, Schwarzenegger saves the day; breaking them free and joining forces with them to bring Villain to the ground.<br/><br/>They are then joined by Mr Church (Willis), who turns up to help end the reign of terror that Villain had started.<br/><br/>This final act contains some of the most entertaining sequences ever put to screen. It's absolutely packed with nostalgia, fans of the unmatchable action heroes will be left happily satisfied with the way their screen time is used.<br/><br/>Stallone and Van Damme have a showdown that will leave fans of the mussels from Brussels breathless and wanting more as he performs his signature kick, twice! Something we have not seen in a very long time.<br/><br/>To conclude, the film is a fast paced entertaining throwback to the action films of the 80's and early 90's, a time when it was all about guns, muscles, cheesy one liners and lots of explosions. People should know what to expect when going into a film like this. It's fun, exciting and a damn good time. Here's to Expendables 3!"

","I just had the experience of watching The Expendables 2, Sunday night, and it was great and satisfying. The movie is loaded with full of action from the moment it starts to the very end. All the characters have a very good harmony and are full of style. You will also enjoy the punch lines they exchange through out the movie.<br/><br/>You can see Arnold in action this time, which really adds up to the movie. Chuck Norris is also in a stunning and stylish role. The female member of the group Maggie(Nan Yu) also fits in the team/story very well.<br/><br/>All the actors appear more than they had in the original, including Bruce and Arnold.<br/><br/>Van Damme has also played very very good role as ""Villain"" and still shows us his good martial arts skills. I loved watching him in action at this age. I wish this film makes a good comeback for him.<br/><br/>As for the story, some reviewers are complaining that it has a poor story. But I do not agree because having such action packed and tough characters who cares about the story? All you will want from these characters is ACTION which you will find plenty through out. All the cast has played their roles very well. And I will give this Eight Stars. My salute to this band of mercenaries!<br/><br/>I will recommend this movie to all the people who love action and to all the people who like to watch movies because You are not gonna find the assembly of these CLASSIC ACTION HEROES anywhere else. This is a must watch for everyone. Thank you.<br/><br/>Khurram Saeed."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","9","3","6","24 August 2012"," Almost as great accept for some minor faults
","Back in 2010, action star Sylvester Stallone introduced his fans to an action experience many would not forget; The Expendables. The Expendables (2010) was a hit for various reasons: its cast was strong, the music was entertaining, the dialog was funny, and the action was violent. Thanks to all that, Stallone (and several other cast members) wanted to make a sequel; well here it is! The sequel to The Expendables (2010) is almost perfect except for its lack of attention to a couple specific characters.<br/><br/>After another successful mission, Barney Ross (Stallone) and the rest of his gang are drawn into taking on another Mr. Church deal when on the job, one of their team members is killed. This is when the expendables go full bore into taking out their enemy. Who's their new enemy? Villain played by Jean-claude Van Damme. Van Damme plays a pretty lethal character. Roberts from 2010 was good but Van Damme makes his character much more dangerous.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, everything was done well. I really liked how there was more screen time for when the characters hung out together and not beating the crap out of bad guys (there's still plenty of it). It allows the audience to believe they're real people and not that they're their own little secret club. Plus even the sarcasm/jokes are turned up and half of it doesn't even belong to Statham, Stallone, Willis, Norris or Schwarzenegger. I also like how they gave special attention to Lundgren's character by not making him seem like he's all brawn and no brain (like from the first film).<br/><br/>The music and action are just as good. Brian Tyler still knows what he's doing when it comes to composing music. And the action is still heavy. Thank god Stallone decided to keep this film rated R. If he didn't, I would have had a bone to pick there. There are some things that can't be toned down. <br/><br/>My only issue with this film is the script (story wise). How is it that writers, Stallone and Wenk pen in new characters and keep old ones but somehow leave out other significant individuals? Charisma Carpenter (Christmas' girlfriend) was even in this movie and yet both writers couldn't find a way to mention what happened to Tool, Mickey Rourke's character? Plus, I really enjoyed Jet Li's performance in the intro and then he's moved out and we never hear from him again? Come on now. There's got to be some coherent story to tie the first to the second. But overall still, this sequel is a pleaser.<br/><br/>The Expendables 2 is a loud actioneer that's fun and is chock full of inside jokes and one liners. A good follow up to the first."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","3","6","23 August 2012"," ""Expendables 2"" makes the necessary adjustments to improve upon its predecessor
","You'd think putting together an action ensemble of some of the best muscle-bound men to ever grace the silver screen warrants an effort that goes beyond casting, but that's not what we got in 2010's ""The Expendables."" The healthy dose of blood spatter and explosions certainly whetted action fans' appetites, but the film ultimately fell short on a number of fronts.<br/><br/>Well, it seems that Stallone and co. heard the criticism, and so it's a relief to say that ""The Expendables 2"" is a distinct improvement and in the simplest way ‚Äî giving us a story worth a damn.<br/><br/>The two big improvements are so fundamental it's hard to understand just why they were ignored the first time around: a formidable villain and a purer motivation for ass-kicking. In scouting other action stars of the past to join the fray for the sequel, bravo to whoever's bright idea it was to not just add them to the list of heroes. Jean Claude Van Damme makes a perfect villain just merely by the esteem in which he's held in action fans' eyes. All that needs to be said about his performance is there are roundhouse kicks.<br/><br/>As for the motivation piece, it's as simple as revenge. Although Church (Bruce Willis) starts the plot going by telling Barney Ross (Stallone) that he owes him, the mission morphs into one of avenging a fallen comrade, and it's done tastefully enough that we actually care.<br/><br/>From an action perspective, ""The Expendables 2"" opens with a James Bond-esque pre-credits scene on steroids. The mission in this opening has nothing to do with the rest of the film, but grabs our attention instantly in addition to being all kinds of fun. Director Simon West, who takes the reigns from Stallone in the first film, uses this scene to set the tone early: You will get blood, explosions and badassery of the highest order in this movie ‚Äî so don't freak out when we try to give you a story and actually develop the characters later on.<br/><br/>In addition to more Church and a lot more Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger), the other characters seem to get real personalities. Dolph Lundgren's character, Gunnar, in particular, is hysterical in this film, whereas in the first he had a weird role as a bipolar freak who turns on his old team. In general, the sense of humor is vastly improved and the camaraderie between all the characters feels more natural.<br/><br/>""The Expendables 2"" also gets distinctly more self aware and meta, so much so to the point where you don't see the characters, just the actors who play them. Gunnar, for example, is painted as a scientific genius turned mercenary, which is true to Lundgren's life story subbing ""mercenary"" for ""action star."" This instance in particular helps expand the palette of personalities in the group, but other instances come off as just pandering. Pretty much everything Schwarzenegger says, for example, is derived from one of his famous one-liners of the past. At times it's funny, at others just pitiful.<br/><br/>The script's preoccupation with both massaging the stars' egos and jabbing at them with deprecating humor doesn't take too much away from the blowing bad guys away spirit of the movie. The action still plays out like ""Grand Theft Auto"" with all the cheats turned on, but there's something sickly satisfying about that approach, especially in a movie that so clearly recognizes that its audience didn't come for the realism. Plus, the concept of putting all these actors together in itself is larger than life.<br/><br/>Most every actor gets a moment in the sun, but many do in odds ways. The handling of Chuck Norris' ""lone wolf"" character makes no degree of sense, which is consequently amusing somehow, Jet Li and Liam Hemsworth get a chance to look badass but aren't in the film from beginning to end, and Randy Couture is just scenery. <br/><br/>On the contrary, Jason Statham gets a ridiculously slick knife sequence and Sly and JCVD play a game of fisticuffs in the finale to balance out the absurd degree of gunfire. Not part of the marketing but a major piece in the film is Nan Yu as Maggie Chen, who adds brains to the mission as well as a chance for Stallone to tell a woman he can't get close to her because of the life he leads.<br/><br/>""The Expendables 2"" is the same degree of testosterone-jacked fun as the first film, only this time the cast, writers and directors decide to give us a little extra in the story to make it worth our while.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","From the moment the experiment in action of The Expendables hit theaters it was heaven. While not everyone had the fun expected it still delivered the one two punch with the action icons fans of the 90's loved. Sadly there were some major ones left out, but has all been taken care with the latest entry into action lore with the Expendables 2. This time around Stallone has stepped out from behind the camera to let Simon West (Con Air) direct this action epic and brought along some of the key players that were missing.<br/><br/>Expendables 2 follows the Expendables as they are sent on a seemingly simple mission, but turns into a search for revenge in hostile territory against a heartless adversary and five tons of weapons-grade plutonium. If you enjoyed the first film you will love this one. If you didn't love the first film you will love this one. Like the previous film this is a testosterone filled gun blazing bloodbath filled with action icons of old doing what we love to see them do. The big difference here as this one just seems like a better overall film. The first film, while fun to watch did seem to be missing a real villain, but here the star player is Van Damme's turn as the cocky adversary they are dealing with. He will quickly remind you why we all loved him so much, while delivering a new type of performance like never before. He has truly grown into something more than just a parody of himself that he seemed to be becoming. The rest of the cast do a great job with the stereotypical one-liners and deliver the action like only they can. This time around besides our key players from the first film, Schwarzenegger, Willis, and Norris get to join in on the fun making this seem almost like a dream. Anyone from the 90's has dreamt of seeing these guys together, but once you see it actually happening it will turn you into a kid again. Everyone has their part to play and do it well, but as with any film with a cast this size; there are some that will get lost in the mix. Here most of the guys have ample screen time, except Jet Li who seems to have taken on more of a cameo role, but still given the time to do what he does. The best of all the cameos has to Norris, who really lives up to his online legend, which they play up in the script as well. He only makes a brief appearance in the movie a couple of times, but it is not only memorable, but he seems to kill more people than anyone else in the entire movie, which is no surprise as he is Chuck Norris.<br/><br/>This is exactly what it is meant to be a fun action packed homage to action films of the 90's. This series reminds the rest of Hollywood how a true action film is done and doesn't spare the body count in teaching this lesson. There is just enough story here to bring the film together but not enough to get in the way of raising the body count. The only real issue here is some of the CGI blood, but you can let it go and just have a great time while wondering who they will be bringing together for Expendables 3. As if the movies weren't enough, there are also trailer for both Stallone and Schwarzengger's next films attached which should be enough to tied us over for the release of their next film together The Tomb.<br/><br/>http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey"

","Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) returns with his ultra-violent friends in this follow up to 2010's moderately enjoyable bloodbath. The sole purpose of 'Expendables 2' is to prove that baths can always be bloodier. I won't bother with the storyline because it's a line so thin that it is barely visible under the weight of all those throat-stabbings and Gatling-gun annihilations. <br/><br/>The noble point about this action porno, as with the first, is that it doesn't take it self seriously for a solitary second. Every word of dialogue is played for laughs. Bruce Willis, as the devious Church, has some funny, tongue-firmly-in-cheek interchanges with Arnie's Trench ('You've 'been back' often enough; it's my turn now'). This time The Governor has a meatier role, evoking performances from his 80s glory years.<br/><br/>'Con Air' Director Simon West knows there are too many characters, which is why Jet Li is excised from the script early on, albeit for dubious reasons. (Being an ethnic minority, he brings a new meaning to the term 'expendable'.) Mickey Rourke doesn't reprise his role, but the cast now includes Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme, who laughably turned downed a role in number one due to it being 'insubstantial'. <br/><br/>You'll wonder why you went back for more punishment, but if you leave your brain at home there's a good chance you'll join in the whooping and cheering as yet another army of goons are blown straight to hell.

","When a member of your family who never goes out let alone go to the movies, you know you have some kind of hit on your hands. My sister and my mom and I all went out to see this exciting movie and it will mark as one of the rarest events of my life.<br/><br/>First off, the movie starts with some really good action. It cuts everything else and gets right into it. The movie knows what you came for (seeing your favorite action heroes blow stuff up) and it delivers. Then we see them celebrate for a little bit, get to know them, but no too long as its time to get to the story. The movie moves quick too. It caters to those with ADD and wants to get to the next action scene quickly. There's also no romance subplot here. It hints at one, but smartly strays from it.<br/><br/>The most pivotal scene of the film is when we are introduced to Jean Claude Van Dam as the villain. He plays one jerk of a villain which isn't a stretch for him since he's a jerk in real life too. He basically belittles Sly and his crew while holding a hostage. This scene set the stage for the rest of the film quite nicely and you really want to see that payback they are demanding.<br/><br/>Sly, Bruce, Arnie, Norris, Statham, they are are all great. My only gripe about this movie is that Jet-Li is hardly in this movie. He leaves them at the beginning of the film and never comes back. I was really hoping for a dramatic return but was bummed out. <br/><br/>But hey, my mom and my sister both enjoyed it and I think any action movie buff would. If you grew up in the eighties loving these guys, you should definitely check out Expendables 2!"
"Boba_Fett1138","7","4","10","20 August 2012"," You should just at least watch it for its final 30 minutes alone.
","It definitely seemed a good move by Stallone to pass the torch on to Simon West and let him sit on the director's chair this time. Seemed that with the first ""The Expendables"" movie Stallone had a hard time balancing things out. The result was a pretty disappointing movie, in which not even the action come across as anything all that great or exciting. This definitely improved with this movie and while it's being far from a great one, it's being a pretty decent and entertaining genre flick!<br/><br/>Please don't ask me what this movie was all about, since I simply absolutely had no idea. But in all fairness, this often had been the case with big overblown action movies and it really doesn't make them any less spectacular or entertaining to watch. It's simply being a movie to have a good and fun time with and not to take too seriously.<br/><br/>And luckily the film-makers and actors took things not that serious either. It's the main reason why this movie works out much better and is simply being more fun than its predecessor. The movie and its jokes are more self aware this time around and they didn't just attempted to create a big action flick but also one that delivers on a more entertaining level. <br/><br/>So there is more fun, the action is better but those are not the only things this sequel improved on. Thing I also really liked about this movie was that it focused more on the team aspect. Everybody gets their moment to shine in this and basically every cast member gets to show off their action skills. Yes, even Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis get to do some serious action related stuff this time around. And it really is awesome seeing them fight literally alongside, along with Sylvester Stallone as well. It helps to make the final 30 minutes basically a fan boys dream and it also are the movie its final 30 minutes that are being the movie its best minutes, which sort of makes you wonder why the rest of the movie, as well as its predecessor, weren't being more like this as well. <br/><br/>And the movie brings in even more big action movie stars from the past this time. Jean-Claude Van Damme is being a pretty good villain, though he shows up in the movie pretty late and also gets to do far too little. Oh well, at least he was being good and enjoyable when he did appear on screen and is still in pretty good form as well, even though he is well in his 50's already. And I admit, it was also awesome to see Chuck Norris in this. Yes, his character is quite pointless and just an excuse to have Norris pop up in this movie but he perhaps was being the most fun character out of the entire movie and I actually do hope they bring him back and make him a part of the team for the next sequel. It's sort of funny how I know basically everything about this guy and his movies but this probably was being the first movie, in which he stars, that I had ever seen. Perhaps it should be time to pick up some of his earlier movies and have a blast with them as well.<br/><br/>Of course there are plenty of flaws in this movie, mostly story related but I'm simply happy about it that this movie at least learned from some of the mistakes it made with the previous movie and this one is simply being a good and enjoyable genre movie to watch. Still not as great and awesome as it by all rights should be but they are more on the right track with this one and lets all hope ""The Expendables 3"" is going to be the ultimate Expendables movie, that everybody is hoping and longing for, ever since the first movie got announced. <br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"ersinkdotcom","8","4","10","18 August 2012"," ""The Expendables 2"" top first outing with bloody body count and cheeky humor
","When ""The Expendables"" hit theaters, action enthusiasts didn't think it could get any better. Sylvester Stallone managed to recruit a majority of the action stars of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s in one movie. Not only did he accomplish this feat, but he constructed the perfect homage to the great action films of the 1980s which featured unapologetic, politically incorrect, and gratuitous violence that made many an adolescent boy and grown men alike smile from ear to ear. <br/><br/>In ""The Expendables 2,"" the newest member (Liam Hemsworth) of Barney Ross's (Sylvester Stallone) team is murdered in cold blood during a mission. Ross vows revenge on the criminal kingpin responsible - Jean Villain (Jean-Claude van Damme). The Expendables go on the hunt for Villain and foil his plans to recover a large amount of plutonium he plans to sell to the highest bidders. <br/><br/>After the first movie was a box office success, it was inevitable that a sequel would follow. One question was how producers and writers were going to top the first film. A couple notable action film figureheads were missing from ""The Expendables."" Could Stallone and his crew possibly top their first outing with a second go-round? <br/><br/>The answer to the question is a resounding yes. ""The Expendables 2"" delivers all the action, violence, humor, and mayhem audiences expect from the familiar stars that appear in it. Many action movie fans left the theater after the original noting that Jean-Claude Van Damme, Chuck Norris, and Steven Seagal were missing from the ensemble cast. They also felt a bit short-changed when it came to the brief appearances of Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br/><br/>Have no fear, moviegoers. Van Damme and Norris are both in attendance this time around. Van Damme plays the main villain and relishes in it. Norris plays a sniper who flies solo but just happens to be everywhere he needs to be at all the right times to help Stallone's crew out of tight spots. Willis and Schwarzenegger make up for their lost time in the first movie by getting in on the main action in this one. <br/><br/>Schwarzenegger transitions from the Governor's office to battlefield look effortless. He has no problem poking fun at himself while delivering his token phrases, whether it be ""I'll be back"" or stealing one from Willis by exclaiming, ""Yippie kay yay."" I couldn't stop myself from grinning as he marched forward in a hail of gunfire while shooting an automatic weapon and jerking with each shot like he was working a jack hammer. <br/><br/>There's no shortage of blood and gore. You can't miss the big splashes of crimson fluid splashing all over the screen. Body parts are blown off and keeping up with a body count is virtually impossible. It's everything you'd expect from a movie combining all the classic elements and players of action films from the past three decades. <br/><br/>""The Expendables 2"" is a nostalgic piece of action movie fun. It has everything one could want in a genre piece of this kind. Two questions came to mind as I was leaving the theater. One was, ""How are they going to top this one?"" and the other was ""Where was Steven Seagal?"""
"sincado-494-853066","3","3","7","5 October 2012"," 7.4 for that????
","I was compelled to write something because really this movie doesn't deserve a 7.4.<br/><br/>First, a movie featuring stars like The Expandable II should last more than a mere 1 and 30 minutes. In fact I just checked and it seems that it last as long as the first, but the first seems so much packed, while this one seems only to take off after the 60 minutes mark.<br/><br/>The action scene are good, but not as over the top as the first one. The Chinese girl is quite lame (what the hell is she doing there, zero credibility by the way, and completely unknown to me, I'm sure Paris Hilton with a big gun would have done better!), the romance is so bad compared to the first one (thinking about Statham kicking the violent ex-boyfriend or the pretty dictator's daughter saved by Stallone and Co.).<br/><br/>OK, Arnie and Chuck Norris expended cameos are quite funny. Dolph's character is also making things a bit more interesting. But after 70 minutes I just got bored. Van Damme as a bad guy? Not bad actually, but again, Roberts in the first one was so much better, even if he wasn't able to kick a knife in a man's heart as Van Damme did.<br/><br/>OK sure you need to see that at least one. But paying big buck for it isn't just logical."
"DUKEJBM","Null","3","7","31 August 2012"," It crosses the line from popcorn action to a long SNL skit...
","This movie delivers exactly what is expected to a fault. It's filled with dumb, nonsensical action with lots of explosions and CGI blood spurts but no imagination or heart. I probably would have enjoyed it more had they not been so blatantly mugging for the camera and filling scenes with inside jokes geared for all the aging stars. It crosses the line from popcorn action to a long SNL skit by the time they work in ""I'll be back"" and ""Yippe-kie-yea"" and Chuck Norris jokes. I like the cast and there is some good action. The finale is damn cool with all the big guns (stars and actual firearms) going off. All they needed was the hot Asian actress to shoot that scene topless and it would be the quintessential all-time mindless guy-flick action scene. Honestly, a step down from the first film and it's not like that one was an all-time classic."
"freemantle_uk","7","3","7","19 August 2012"," What the first film needed to me
","Back in 2010, fans of action cinema were salivating over the prospect of some of the greatest action heroes of '80s and '90s coming together for the first time in The Expendables, but it took itself too seriously to win approval from the vast majority. The filmmakers listened to this criticism in putting together The Expendables 2 and director Simon West injects a big dose of self-aware humour that the series needed.<br/><br/>After a successful mission Nepal to rescue a Chinese billionaire, the mysterious spy Church (Bruce Willis), demands Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and The Expendables pay him back for their shenanigans in the first film and get a case from a clashed plane in Albania. However, a ruthless mercenary and criminal, Jean Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme) awaits them. He plans to sell several tons of former Soviet plutonium and enslaves a population of local men to mine it.<br/><br/>The winning feature of this sequel is the action sequences, which is the source of the film's new-look sense of humour. It starts with the pre-title card sequence and includes written gags on their vehicle (with an acknowledgement of some of the actors' real-life right-wing views) to the fun of Jet Li fighting with a frying pan. The action is delightfully violent with plenty of head explosions and blood packs. These fun and well-edited set pieces offer plenty of variety. There are shoot-outs, martial arts combat scenes, and feats of pure physical strength.<br/><br/>The Expendables 2 has sealed West's return as an action director. Sadly, some of the actors do not get a chance to shine in the physical front; some of the roles were really just cameos. The CGI was sadly weak, and there is a little too much self-referencing near the end, but it's mainly in an old-fashioned and fun action movie type of way. At times, The Expendables 2 is weirdly meta, acknowledging Dolph Lundgren's real life education and pre-acting career and playing off the rivalry between Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Even Brian Tyler's score plays homage to some of the film's stars.<br/><br/>The heart of the movie is still the relationship between Stallone and Statham, which is full of banter, wit and overall great chemistry ‚Äî it feels as if they have been working together for years. They have their moments to shine as individuals as well as a pair and even Statham has his own rival to go with the Stallone one in the JCVD rivalry. Despite being one of the most recent action stars of the bunch, The Stath is one of the best characters as he's fun and gets a chance to show off his fighting skills.<br/><br/>There are plenty of clich√©s in the sequel, including foreshadowing of the death certain characters and the villains are evil for the sake of being evil. JCVD and his crew and needlessly ruthless and there are a elements similar to first movie with an outside force taking control of a region. But the advantage of JCVD as a villain is he is a real, imposing threat to the Expendables.<br/><br/>While there is a more tongue-in-cheek tone, West still keeps a gritty look and the cinematography uses deliberately dull colours in order to do so. Early in the second act the movie drags a little and is slightly aimless, but once the action picks up it is easily forgiven. West's direction is a little workman like, but this was the approach this series needs: the audience just wants good scenes and that nostalgic feeling from the glory days of action films.<br/><br/>There is a macho culture of friendship within this movie as it centres on comrades who had been fighting together for years, but Yu Nan, playing Maggie, mixes things up as a tough woman who can handle herself as the brains of the outfit. It is refreshing to see a woman in this type of film not being a damsel in distress, but the weird faux-romance female characters have with Stallone continues in this movie, though luckily we do not see the 66-year-old bump uglies with a woman half his age.<br/><br/>Earlier this year, Chuck Norris announced that The Expendables 2 was going to be PG-13, but because of the beautifully gory violence an R-rating was ensured. Still, there was one weird aspect to the film: no swearing.<br/><br/>The Expendables 2 will supply fun action sequences, some cheesy jokes and has the sense of humour and self-awareness the first movie needed.

","A tour-de-force of explosive action and intentional and unintentional laughs. The first film worked as a sort of homage to those ridiculous but highly entertaining action epics of the late 80s' and early 90s'. Being a child of that era raised by TV and movies for the most part lol. It's a very cool thing to see these guys on the big screen and in a surprisingly better film than its predecessor. This entry pretty much delivers everything you wanted the first time around that you didn't get. This time around the expendable crew picks up a new member in the sexy but way younger Liam Hemsworth of the recent blockbuster Hunger Games as a sort of expert military sniper. As the film starts they are on a mission to save a Chinese billionaire and we are thrust into the pit of the action but upon returning home they discover they have another mission and something happens that leaves the group wanting revenge with a new female member in tow the action really starts and gets crazy violent and obscenely graphic. It's amazing that Stallone , Schwarzenegger, Willis , Chuck Norris, Jean Claude Van Damme amongst others are pulling off such insanely physical roles, my hat is off to them. They're acting not be so strong but it never really was they have charisma, loads of it. As the somewhat young-ins so to speak Jason Statham, Crews, Cotoure are around some amazingly physical especially Statham who is just amazing and Crews who has some of the funniest scenes. The movie is fun, crazy and surprisingly addictive. The expendables 2 is an explosive, testosterone filled action fest that delivers some amazingly entertaining good. It may be crap but it's glorious crap. 4/5"
"JBlueNote","6","4","11","19 August 2012"," Nothing But the Big Stars Showin' Off
","The Expendables 2 was just as I expected it to be: guns blazin', straight out violence, bloody gore, and the big superstars showing off. The plot was simple and had some holes, but I guess the action outweighed any story that it had. The acting was kind of off for me. Some characters had some weird lines and were hard to follow, including some of the new ones. I guess I shouldn't complain when this movie is something that's kind of in the same ballpark of ""The Avengers"" concept wise where you have the biggest and baddest action movie heroes of the past two decades battle tyranny. Probably the only thing I liked besides the full-out action might have been how Chris Hemsworth's brother, Liam Hemsworth, faired in this movie among the veteran cast. Didn't think that another actor besides the obvious ones in this movie could have stood out in this movie. There's nothing really much else to say but to just get ready for another action packed, gore filled movie that will have you ooing, ahhing, and laughing at some times after hearing some of the jokes that go from ""Really, you had to say that again,"" to ""Oh wow, that was really funny."" I'd rate it a 6/10 and recommend it if you really want to see a real life version of ""The Avengers"", except the superpowers are replaced with guns, tanks, planes, bombs, etc.!!!"

","Greetings again from the darkness. As we get older, we expect to learn from our experiences. That's exactly what happened here. It's been almost two years to the day since The Expendables hit theatres. That first entry was directed, produced, written by, and starred Sylvester Stallone. This time around Sly sticks to acting and a script credit. Con Air director Simon West is now at the helm and the film clearly benefits from better action, improved characters and especially MUCH more humor ... the key reason it works.<br/><br/>Most of the familiar faces are back. Stallone as Barney, the leader of this pack of mercenaries; Jason Statham as Christmas; Dolph Lundgren as Gunner; Terry Crews as Hale Caesar; Randy Couture as Toll Road; and Jet Li as Yin Yang, though he is unfortunately only in the pre-opening credits sequence. Also back, after brief but funny cameos in the first, are Bruce Willis as Church, and Arnold Schwarzenegger as Trench. If somehow that's not enough testosterone for you, the second installment also provides Liam Hemsworth as Billy the Kid, Jean-Claude Van Damme as Villain (pronounced vi-LANE, get it?), martial arts expert Scott Adkins, and 72 year old Chuck Norris as Booker ... the ""Lone Wolf"" soldier.<br/><br/>For sake of balance, the female lead is played by Nan Yu as Maggie. She is a brilliant fighter, speaks multiple languages, yet dumb enough to fall for Barney (guessing that was Stallone's contribution to the script). While the story is necessarily simple, her role is vital in that she softens some scenes, while at the same time holding her own with the sea of steroid and botox stars.<br/><br/>This version is extremely likable and filled with tongue-in-cheek humor, sarcasm and wit. The guys are not hesitant about poking fun at themselves or each other ... all the while surrounded by nearly non-stop action, gun play, missile firing and other forms of over-the-top violence and action. In other words, it's exactly what we hoped it would be! (www.moviereviewsfromthedark.wordpress.com)"

Too bad Jason Statham is tarred by association with it. <br/><br/>Let's pick a few aspects at random: the terrible acting, the painful dialog, the complete lack of chemistry, the heavy guns that don't have a recoil, the (sometimes) unlimited ammunition, the regenerating bad guys (especially in the airport scene), the incompetent villains.<br/><br/>On the (sort-of) positive side, the movie is an advertisement for how even 60+ year old men can maintain muscle mass (naturally, I'm sure) and for the efficacy of multiple face lifts."

Maggie comes along as per Church's orders, and they retrieve an object from a safe, only to be hijacked by Villain. Villain kills Billy to get respect. Right. The team decides to track down Villain, who runs a mercenary for hire crew that tends to be on the opposite side of what Barney does.<br/><br/>The lost object contains the location of a mine where the Russians store plutonium. The Bulgarian locations looked like a picture from 50 years ago. They meet up with Booker, who helps them in a fire fight.<br/><br/>They encounter a group called the Sangs, who kidnap the men and teen boys to work in the mines. They set about to do in the Sangs, and recover the plutonium. When things look bad, Booker, Church, and Trench drop by with extra resources. There was a huge amount of shooting and dying.<br/><br/>The movie more or less ends with the climactic fight between Van Damme and Stallone.<br/><br/>In the end, Barney is all even with the CIA, the bad guys are defeated, and the plutonium is in safer hands.

"estebangonzalez10","4","2","4","11 September 2013"," The Expendables 2 is simply a Macho-flick
","""Track him, find him, kill him.""<br/><br/>The Expendable 2 is a ridiculous and over the top action film that tries to connect with the audience through nostalgic action scenes and cheesy one liners. Teaming these great action stars from the 80's was a great idea and appealed to us in the first Expendables because we hadn't seen these actors do anything interesting in a long time, but in the sequel that novelty is gone and it felt like a complete embarrassment seeing these once great and talented actors working with such a lazy and predictable script. These action films full of testosterone kind of have the same appeal for men that Katherine Heigl's films have for women. Not even director Simon West who has made some decent action films in the past couldn't save this film from becoming such a train wreck. I really enjoyed Con Air and thought The Mechanic was entertaining, but this has to be one of his weakest efforts as a director. There are so many cheesy lines and dialogues in this film that it's not even funny. Arnold Schwarzenegger repeats his ""I'll be back"" line from Terminator like three times, Bruce Willis tells Arnold ""You've been terminated,"" and several more lines that try to appeal to our memory of those great films of the past. I think that it was a great idea to reunite these guys for one movie, but a sequel was completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>The team from the first film is back with Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) leading the guns for hire crew which consists of Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Yin Yang (Jet Li), Gunnar (Dolph Lundgren), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), and Toll Road (Randy Couture). Barney hires some fresh blood for their next mission, former US soldier Billy (Liam Hemsworth), who everyone pretty much calls the Kid. CIA agent Church (Bruce Willis) hires the men for a simple mission that consists of retrieving something from a crashed plane in Asia. He assigns his assistant, Maggie (Nan Yu) to go with them and bring back the device they are looking for. The mission goes wrong when some men are waiting for them at the crash site and take The Kid hostage forcing them to drop their weapons and give them the device they've come to retrieve. Villain (Jean Claude Van Damme) takes the device and the Expendables are forced to regroup in order to face Villain and his team known as The Sangs. <br/><br/>In my opinion the best thing about The Expendables 2 are the two new additions: Jean Claude Van Damme as the villain and Chuck Norris who has a couple of cameos. The scenes with Chuck Norris are hilarious as he plays along with the famous internet memes about him. He mentions how once a cobra bit him in the dessert and after five days in agonizing pain the cobra died. The Expendables does play a lot with the stereotypes of each actor and the films that made them famous, but the action scenes aren't worth saving this movie. There is nothing unique or original about this film, we've seen it all before with much better scripts. This film is so predictable that you could tell everything that was going to happen. It is just a lazy repeat of the 80's action genre films. The self deprecating jokes didn't really work for me."

","I was going to give this film 1 star, but I added an extra star out of respect for one particular individual, whose name I will likely never know: the poor soul tasked with subtitling this wretched mess for Netflix. Here is my take-away: <br/><br/>1. Between Stallone, Van Damme, and Schwarzenegger, much of the ""dialog"" in this film is so mush-mouthed as to be unintelligible (hence my aforementioned tremendous respect for the subtitler). On the other hand, there isn't very much important dialog in this movie anyway.<br/><br/>2. There is a plot, but it's so generic, predictable, and clich√©d that it serves only as a tool to divide up the acts. (Alright, to be fair, it was probably helpful in planning the production schedule, too).<br/><br/>3. There are lots of explosions. Lots and lots of explosions.<br/><br/>That's about all there is to say about The Expendables 2. It's not just a bad film; it's an exceptionally bad film. It managed to insult my intelligence, my faith in these beloved action stars, my love of movies in general, and my faith in humanity as a species.<br/><br/>But of course, they're already making another sequel."

The result is clear for all to see: stretched up eyebrows that make him look like Jack Nicholson. <br/><br/>Every rundown has-been actor has been re-recruited + 1 new(Chuck Norris). Norris only signed on because of one condition: he made Sly Stallone remove all the bad XXX swearwords from the script. Norris is a SAINT.<br/><br/>Only thing worth about this film is for Van Damme fans. He looks absolutely KILLER in his role. Plus also his legendary Kickboxer flying roundhouse kick. To put it short: Fight between Van Damage and Sly Stallone is the only reason to watch this film. The fight is short like Stallone's sex-time in bed (With Viagra). You could take a leak, come back, and the fights over. <br/><br/>Van Damme could break Sly's neck-bone with that one special kick. Finito.<br/><br/>To mention other stars: Arnold Schwarzenegger was good to see as well as Bruce Willis. They have small cameo roles and are wasted in the film. Dolph Lundgren looks absolutely disgusting. He's become a real slob. <br/><br/>Plot of dub*ss joke of a film: Barney Ross is approached by CIA man Church, who wants him and his guns for hire to go to the former Soviet Union to retrieve something that was on a plane that crashed. Church doesn't tell him what he is getting. And Church sends a woman, Maggie with him to make sure he gets it. They find the plane and get the thing but some men take one of Barney's people hostage and the leader tells him to give him what they got or he'll kill his hostage. The give it to him but he kills his hostage anyway. Barney asks Maggie what was so important about that thing. She says that it showed the location of a Russian plutonium storage mine. Barney decides to track the man down and deal with him. They track them down and discover that the man they seek is Villain who leads a group known as The Sangs and that they have taken all the men from the surrounding villages to work the mine. <br/><br/>Verdict: stick to The Avengers(2012), which I think is the best film of the year I have seen."

Who ever spent their money in the making of this film supposed to ask for more from this movie. The previews review was commercial not accurate at all.

In hindsight I would rather have starved then watch this movie.<br/><br/>The story was absolutely terrible. I know it was an action movie and the story line is always going to be unrealistic but this was easily the stupidest thing I've ever watched and I have watched the Youtube video ""Krispy Kreme - The Baddest"" several times. <br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone was way too involved in this movie, he is a terrible actor. Nan Yu who played Maggie was also terrible. In that sense they made the perfect on screen couple. I see Stallone also had a part in writing this movie which explains a lot, the man can barely speak so it doesn't surprise me that he can't write either.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope that this is the last ever Expendables movie ever. If you would like to watch a bunch of old actors who were never really good at acting before shoot guns and blow things up. Throw in lots of lame one liners that will make you cringe rather then laugh. Then go ahead watch Expendables 2 but I strongly recommend not to. It ranks as one of the worst movies I have ever seen."

It looks like nobody had fun making this and they wish they were somewhere else doing something else.<br/><br/>It feels like those old Hollywood movies where the actors show up, stand on their marks, read their lines, and drink heavily after to deal with the frustration. Really a shame considering how much talent was lined up for this.<br/><br/>The feeble attempts at nuance just make it that much more painful.<br/><br/>If you liked the sequels of other titles like Anaconda, Halloween, and Pirranah, you might really like this one."

","The Expendables 2 turned out to be a big disappointment for me. I felt right from the first 10-20 minutes that now there will be something impressive & by half-time I felt when will this movie end. Really, one expects ""quality"" stuff from legends like Stallone, Bruce, Arnold. But the outcomes were very predictable. I saw it in an encoded 4.5 GB Blu-ray 720p version & I expected I was on for one and half hour of extreme & ""quality"" action. These legends indeed proved that they should now be in a museum. I am very disappointed. :-( The Expendables 1 had some new & quality stuff in it & the action scenes were indeed good. In this movie, one can feel that the screenplay lagged something. It forced me to think that the screenplay is actually that of a B-grade movie sometimes. I don't know why the movie has got 7.4 votes but I think it's mostly to do with the presence of such college of legends. Indeed 7.4 is very less if one imagines a film to have such a collegium. It may have to do with Ego or something that you can't bring so many legends in one movie."

","Back in 2008 Sylverster Stallone had a pretty solid and great idea. To bring together the best action starts of the past decade and through them together in one mega action flick-and it wasn't all that great. All that however is changed in the sequel which is actually far superior to the first movie, and just might be one of the best action movies to grace the screen in years.<br/><br/>The plot is a simple one (but with a movie like this who really is expecting an Oscar contender) When the Expendables go to retrieve a computer locked in a CIA safe they get more than they bargained for when their newest team member is shot and killed by a terrorist organization who plans to use the computer to discover the largest deposit of uranium in the world.<br/><br/>Thats it, plain and simple, and thats all the movie needs. The action is amped up and there is plenty of gore to be had. Most of the action films lately have be PG-13 superhero movies, so if you have been waiting for a Die Hard action film then look no further.<br/><br/>My last complaint about the first movie was than Jean Claude Van Damm was no where to be seen (since he is my favourite action star) well he gets the full treatment in this movie as the film main antagonist! It looks like he was having allot of fun with it too, and a great cameo by Chuck Noris (they even have him say his own Chuck Noris joke) this movie is highly entertaining.<br/><br/>Great Jokes, awesome action, and a great chance to see some start of old kick ass I give this movie a 8/10"

Chris Hemsworth is OK, but his entire set up as a character is just simply to die. hes got it all on the plate, the beautiful girlfriend, hes going to quit from the team and he's new. Van Damme was great fun as the villain, but out of all the characters,my favourite was Chuck Norris, the mighty god himself. no really,the portray him as some sort of god like being, he saves everyone there from a lump of bad guys and a tank, and just walks on cool as the breeze. they even slide in a Chuck Norris fact, but part of what sold it for me was every time he made an appearance shooting people at the end, there was just this weird sound that accompanied him, making him all the more mythical.<br/><br/>the story is a standard one, a mixture of revenge and stopping the villains from taking over the world and blow everything else to f*cking smithereens. the end fight between sly n van Damme could have been a bit longer, but it was still brutal fun none the less.<br/><br/>there is small issue i have tho. in the beginning its said that Lee Christmas' woman is cheating on him. i expected some sort of part towards the end where he dumps her in an amusing way. i didn't even get that. as a matter of fact, we didn't get anything, they mention once more somewhere further in and thats it. seriously? thats an issue that did kind of need to be addressed in a better fashion.<br/><br/>apart from that (and a wall thats invincible against tank shells) its a damn good movie. damn, damn good for a tribute to old action films. the cast is part of what holds this together. some are more recent, but most are the classic people you want to see. its giant eye candy, its great to watch, but shut your brain down for a while. just enjoy the roller-coaster and you'll want to ride it again"

The starting action sequence is great where the Sylvester and group enter the heavily guarded enemy camp in Nepal. Van Damme is the villain and one you don't want to mess with.

Barney and his band of mercenaries are mostly for hire, but sometimes they stop out to help the downtrodden, like a ultra-violent Robin Hood and his merry men.<br/><br/>Filled with mostly familiar faces, Expendables 2 is a good. head-blowing (literally) time. With Van Damme in play you know the kicks are going to be lethal, Statham's fighting form is elegant and always a joy to watch. I wish those two had gotten to go up against each other. Stallone taking the pain is something we count on, but it's a little tedious compared to fight choreography like Jet Li's. I can never remember who Couture is but the ear jokes never get old. And Lundgren, being funny in addition to still incredibly beautiful and strong looking, who knew he had that in him? I wont list all the stars, but some are getting a little too much surgery. Arnold is looking a little Sonic the Hedgehog-y lately. The toys were great and the music was kicking. I bet this was a fun shoot, it was fun to watch."

","Loved & hugely enjoyed this ,a good old fashioned action movie. My only complaint get rid of Arnie he was the only week link in the whole movie hes not funny and seem to want to be terry crews who was far more entertaining, everybody else seemed good except for his cigar smoking smug visage ruining it with that undecipherable one liners. no Arnie for expendables 3. good old chuck was amusing playing himself up and the inclusion of Dolph's character was welcome and another good play up. Simon west done a good job of recreating the 80's action flick and the pace was such that even my dad didn't drift off which is no mean feat.

","All the action heroes from the first movie are reunited in this movie, plus a few extras and a little bit expanded roles from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>I loved the first movie and scored it 10/10 mainly because a lot of action movies before have been disappointing when it comes to action. This sequel also contains enough action to satisfy although it could have been a bit better by extending one or two of the action scenes in between Another thing that would have made it better was to include a car chase which the first movie had. The storyline is not a very good one but when it comes to a straightforward action movie like this one, its what you would expect. This movie is style over substance, so don't go in expecting Shakespeare or whatever. It also contains a lot of good humour making it funnier than most overrated if not bad comedy movies. And as one of my friends pointed out, Jean-Claude Van Damme made a better villain than in the first one.<br/><br/>Even though I thought it could have been better in one or two ways, I still liked it. Lets hope Expendables 3 will take this on board."

I liked the first movie so my expectations for this move was pretty high. When i first heard/ saw that Van Dame was in the Cast i smiled and thought to myself that this movie's gonna be the *hit. Van Dame did a great job in this movie, i'd like to say that he was the best character in this movie. The next cast member i liked was Mr. Hemsworth (The kid), He put a good effort in the movie and i think it's all thanks to Mr. Stallone. These were the people i liked the most but ""The expendables- members"" did great acting too and Mr.Lundgren was way 2 funny.

","There has been a lack of simple gut-to-the-ground action movies over the last several years. CGI has reigned supreme, which isn't a bad thing. However Ex2 brings action back to its roots; big explosions, heavy fight scenes, and much loved comedic violence. The plot is simple and forced by some of the legendary talent, but it propels the movie through its storyline.<br/><br/>I watched everyone in this movie while growing up. and when I think of movies that remind me of being a teenager, the stars of this movie are at the top of the list.

","Whilst I didn't exactly adore 'The Expendables 2', it did improve upon a lot of what I didn't like about the previous film.<br/><br/>The story is significantly more intriguing, though still very bare bones, and not exactly original. The locations feel much more exotic and unique. A lot of the characters are still not memorable, although at least the team dynamic is stronger here; whilst the first film felt like people kept coming and going, this one mostly keeps them together as a tight unit, giving the supporting characters more screen time and emphasizing their comradery. The direction of the action is also stronger; much more coherent than the first film, with more imagination behind it as well.<br/><br/>Whilst it isn't terribly memorable, it is a decent action flick."

","I wouldn't otherwise rate The Expendables 2 very high but its mindblowing cast just cannot be ignored. The first movie was already good (and perhaps with a better story) but I still think that this second part manages to do the all-star cast thing even better, which ultimately was the whole point of these films.<br/><br/>If somebody told me in the 90's that there will be a movie with Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis, Norris, Lundgren, and Van Damme in the same movie that would have sounded like talk of crazy person. So, I give extra points for the sheer herculean task of getting all these guys involved. Especially cool to see Chuck Norris who wasn't in the first film.<br/><br/>Occasional self-irony is okay but I think Arnold's ""I'm back"" went a little bit overboard.<br/><br/>This movie cannot be rated in normal rating standards.

"monkeysgalore","10","0","0","27 April 2020"," As Good as the First, and an Incredible Action Flick
","Though it's difficult for me to pick a favorite, I'd say that this is the best film in the series. The Expendables 2 rocks.<br/><br/>Opening on a bombastic note, The Expendables 2 hits the ground running and never really stops.<br/><br/>I think Simon West, while a bit of a risk, ended up being a great directorial choice. He knows action (the dude did <a href=""/title/tt0118880/"">Con Air (1997)</a>) and he is great with action scenes and movie structure. It's sad that his career kind of fizzled out, as he obviously has the gift.<br/><br/>The main cast is back, this time with more people you love. Stallone is great as usual, as are Statham, Crews, and Lundgren. Couture is ok, but once again not given enough to do, which I'm ok with, as the other stars are more interesting. Arnold and Bruce Willis are back, and both get a good amount of screen time and actually get do participate in the action. Unfortunately, Jet Li is only present in the opening, and ducks out after that (apparently there were scheduling conflicts with another movie he was doing). The movie's biggest aces in its sleeve though, are Jean-Claude Van Damme, and Chuck Norris. Jean-Claude is a great villain, and a vast improvement over the villain from the first film. He's obviously having fun with the role. Chuck Norris gets a bit of screen time and is hilarious, since it's the meme version of Chuck Norris. He even makes a Chuck Norris joke, in case you wondering how seriously the movie takes itself (warning, it doesn't). Liam Hemsworth is here too. That's cool, I guess.<br/><br/>The action is explosive, violent, and abundant. The opening battle scene is long and joyous. Vehicles crash and explode, people are shredded by bullets, there's a boat chase and battle that actually felt almost like an homage to From Russia with Love, just on a much larger scale. There are many shootouts and battles throughout the movie, and Jason Statham kills a bunch of dudes with knives in a church, and that's awesome. The airport shootout is a fist-pumping moment, and a highlight for sure. Seeing all of the protagonists onscreen together killing bad guys was great, and seeing Sly, Arnie, and Willis shooting people side-by-side almost made me wet my pants. The final fight is brutal and great, and pretty well-choreographed too.<br/><br/>As bloodily, almost sadistically violent, loud, and fun as the first, arguably more so, The Expendables 2 is as good a time with an action movie as you can have."

","When I sat down to watch The Expendables 2, I knew exactly what I was getting into from the start. I knew it was going to be over-the-top action and enough testosterone for 100 films combined. It delivered on expectations, but did nothing to exceed them. The plot is paper thin, there is a significant lack in logic, and none of the attempts at emotion did anything for me. I didn't totally hate the film because it is so silly, and rarely pretends that it's aspiring to be anything more. I also like a number of the actors in The Expendables 2, even if they weren't given much acting to do here. It has moments of dumb fun, and I can appreciate that in small doses. The worst aspect of The Expendables 2 is that they shoehorned in so many terrible cameos and references to their past movies. Bruce Willis at least had some purpose in the plot, but throwing in Schwarzenegger to awkwardly spout off ""I'll Be Back"" and ""Yippee Ki-Yay"" was painful to watch. Then there's the truly stupid Chuck Norris scenes that made me groan so hard I missed the next couple of lines. For what it is, The Expendables 2 is watchable, but if they had tried a little harder it could have been a bit better than a trashy action film."

","From the opening scene and all the way up to the conclusion of the final scene, it is absolutely fascinating and I love how these movies get right into the action. Of course the death of the character, whom I won't mention sucked, it basically sets up the entire movie and almost makes you feel the hate that Barney & the rest of the team have toward the person responsible. It had been so long since I'd seen the first and to be honest, at the time I just wasn't really into these movies. So yesterday I decided to watch this and wow, glad I did.<br/><br/>Absolutely action packed like the first, at least from what I remember. And more action with bigger, badder guns. Definitely loved seeing Jean Claude VD in it as most of his movies unfortunately are a little corny. He's just one BAMF and fun to watch him fight which is why I assume people watch his movies. The only other movie I honestly ever really watched of his and enjoyed was Sudden Death.

The desperate desire for intimacy between the characters is almost bursting through their pumped-up swollen veins throughout.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, none of the characters ever comes to terms with this forbidden deep corporeal desire for one another and they are thus cursed into a life of externalising these feelings as mindless violence in wiping-out hundreds of non-western people who they cannot see as real humans due to the blindness of their US imperialism and the crisis of their suppressed love and sexual desire for one another.<br/><br/>Such a missed opportunity to not allow the underwritten tensions come to the surface in the context of modern action filmmaking."

","As a person who believes that this sequel isn't as good as the first movie, I observe that most people who didn't like it were reluctant to express their views openly as some people praised this film (often to the detriment of the first). Don't be! And here is why.<br/><br/>I'm sure that I'm not the only one who believes that this whole trilogy contains a lot of typical boring Hollywood contents such as dull jokes, a very easily predictible plot and a mixture of races like an Olympics game, just to catch all type of audience. However, what made the first movie worth seeing for me were its quite strong cinematography, sophisticated use of guns (oh, who could forget that unnecessary but equally satisfactory use of front gun on the aircraft by Statham!) and funny surprise elements, such as jokes on Arnie's governorship. In this movie, the latter is only added by two scenes of Uncle Chuckie and other than that, everything about the scenario is as much predictible and typical as it could be. In fact, it goes as far as all the good guys getting away in one piece from any kind of danger! I mean, even the cyborgs in Terminator injured and suffered more. The fact that JCVD's fighting skills are just limited to one long kick was another disappointment about this sequel.<br/><br/>Then, why so many people liked it? In two words: Chuck Norris. Seeing the old man in an action movie with his fellas is just what an average American 80s action movie enthusiast would need to adore this piece. So basically, if you're not fan of such a nostalgia, then it's ABSOLUTELY normal that you didn't rate this movie any more than 6 or the first one."

The team are all back in an even more stylised Action Thriller, the look & cinematography is very gritty & harsh & the Awesome theme music blasts as the non-stop thrilling action kicks in.<br/><br/>The cast again is great with some new additions with obviously Van Damme but also with the excellent but underrated Scott Adkins as Damme's right hand man ""Hector"" & the guy is an Awesome tough as hell villain, there's also a return of the Action king Schwarzenegger back as ""Trench"" the other mercenary who often works with Barney Ross, it's a bigger part & just his presence in the film makes it feel more important as an action ensemble piece, we also get Bruce Willis back as the mysterious ""Church"" in a bigger part & a great extended cameo by Action veteran Chuck Norris as ""Booker"" & with a cast like that it makes me wanna cheer.
This sequel is a blast of adrenaline pumping action & brutal fight scenes, this is a much more fast & furious action Thriller with a very cool fight between Stallone & Van Damme, now the fight is good & well done but not Amazing as you would expect from these two action greats & it's kind of one sided as it's Stallone's film & Van Damme gave up too easily but IT'S a solid fight just not Amazing.

The Expendables films are fan service for 80's action movie lovers. The second installment ups the ante with new cast members and the rare opportunity for Van Damme to play the heavy. He should do it more often - he's amazing in this role, given to snappy one-liners and pure menace in every scene.<br/><br/>New team member Billy (Liam Hemsworth) tells Barney (Sylvester Stallone) that he wants to retire and live with his girlfriend. That's before the fateful mission from Mr. Church that brings them up against Van Dame and his army of Sangs.<br/><br/>The coolest part of this film is when the team is saved by Booker (Chuck Norris), who is the same character that Chuck played in Good Guys Wear Black. I kind of love how deep these films go into movies that aren't usually as loved or as remembered except by a choice few. He's also referred to as a lone wolf, which is a shoutout to another Norris movie, Lone Wolf McQuade.<br/><br/>Along with new team member Maggie, the Expendables must save five tons of refined plutonium abandoned in a Russian mine before Vilain sells it on the black market, shifting the balance of the world's power.<br/><br/>Of course, everything works out just fine. That's what we expect in these kinds of films. Lots of bullets. Lots of knives. Lots of things blowing up real good. And plenty of snappy lines along the way. Hey - how can you beat a movie with a body count of 482?<br/><br/>Sly himself said of the people he recruited this time out, ""I like using people that had a moment and then maybe have fallen on some hard times and give them another shot. I like those kinds of guys. Someone did it for me and I like to see if I can do it for them.""<br/><br/>Director Simon West gets how to shoot action. His resume speaks to that fact, with films like Con Air, The General's Daughter and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. This was the first film that Stallone appeared in that he didn't direct for over a decade.<br/><br/>If you love Jean-Claude Van Damme, good news. We'll be featuring his films all next week.

The screenwriters, along with Stallone, put as much cliched and self referential dialog into the story as possible for fans who just can't get enough of this stuff. My favorite exchange occurred when Ahnold and Willis traded lines from their respective movies - Willis: ""You'll be back enough, I'll be back"". To which Schwarzenegger's character replies ""Yippie-ki-yay"", (but without the m...f...).<br/><br/>All of the gang is back from the original picture, and anyone who felt cheated by the quick spots by Arnold and Bruce Willis in that one, they made up for it here. With additional help from Chuck Norris, and on the bad guy side, Jean-Claude Van Damme as the principal villain, or Vilain as it were. I was a little disappointed he was the main thug behind the Sangs in this story, but what the heck, this wasn't for mensa candidates. These guys couldn't help themselves putting on their serious game faces and just wallowing in the gunfire and mounting dead bodies. You have to hand it to Stallone, I don't think I've seen him as ripped in a picture since Rocky III. Which reminds me, it might have been a good idea to get Terry Bollea in this picture as long as they were going for so much muscle.<br/><br/>In any event, don't look here if you're after intellectual movie fare.

","A much better improvement over its predecessor in nearly all areas. Stallone purely focussing on the acting and partially the writing was a smart move, doing the directing as well was just too much for him last time. Barney and his gang of mercenaries are employed once again to stop a megalomaniac from unleashing a deadly weapon. Bigger action, badder weapons and brisker pacing, improvements improvements improvements! That's what I like to see. Alas, the plot is one dimensional and incredibly dull again. The dialogue is either cringey or boring, but atleast there is more characterisation here. It isn't the ""Stallone and Statham show"", the other members feel more integrated which was great to see. The opening action sequence immediately had me hooked, the sound of pounding guns obliterating baddies (literally shredding them to pieces) and the exciting explosions harked back to classic action films. It's mindless, numbing and will make your eyes bleed. More muscles and testosterone than a can of 'Mr Muscle', bulging biceps in every scene as I count how many veins are popping out on Stallone's arm (the answer is three by the way). Acting is serviceable with more focus on the stunt work, which is fine for this type of flick. Throwing blades, raging tanks and gigan...WAIT! Stop! Guys, Chuck Norris waltzes in and steals the film!? ""I was bitten by a poisonous cobra, five agonising days later the cobra died"". Life...complete! The constant cheesy lines were cringeworthy to say the least, particularly when Willis and Schwarzenegger were on screen together. ""I'm back"", ""I'll terminate you"", ""yippee-kiyay""...we get it. Nostalgia is beautiful, but don't force these quotes in. It's so out of place. Despite the bland plot and horrific dialogue, it's a fun entertaining time that'll keep you occupied. More of an 80s throwback than the first instalment, so atleast I got something I was promised this time (finally!)."
"crendine","10","0","0","11 January 2018"," Explosive !
","In this second installment of The Expendables series, Stallone and company include a few former action heroes to create quite an ensemble cast. As he has done in the past, Stallone's sequels set out to top the original and he has succeeded here as well. What makes this film and it's predecessor enjoyable and somewhat unique is the fact that Stallone's character (Barney Ross) is a member of a team as opposed to a one-man wrecking crew like Rambo and Cobra. The plot here is very similar to the first film but the action and flow seem to be increased. Jean Claude Van Damm turns in a very convincing performance as a villainous arms dealer. The humor here is also escalated further than the first film. 
If you're fan of action movies with war as the backdrop, you will probably enjoy this film very much. It's simply entertainment. Nothing more, nothing less !"

"DeuceWild_77","7","0","0","29 November 2017"," Produced to please the Generation X, but in fact aimed to the Millennials...
","Well, the meaning of ""The Expendables"" franchise is like a sort of a wet dream from the Generation X, which during the peak of the action movies in the fabulous 80's decade, were devoted fans in the line to the theater or to the near videostore to watch / rent the latest effort from this bunch of guys. 80's action films symbolized the freedom of speech in an Era who wasn't politically correct to the use of violence on-screen, an Era of true action heroes with attitude always delivering sarcastic & witty on-liners when facing the danger. <br/><br/>After the global success of the first movie, Stallone this time just a co-writer, called Simon West (""Con Air"", ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"") to the director's seat to concentrate only in leading this all-star cast and perhaps, minimizing and controlling the major egos involved. <br/><br/>""The Expendables 2"" truly delivers over-the-top action non-stop, well- staged fight scenes with less shaky cam (an improvement over the original), flashy editing, a frenetic pace and cool props. The plot is basic & clich√©, but at least, it's self-indulgent and goes forward straight to the business. <br/><br/>The bad thing is, even more than the first, this movie lacks heart and soul. It's too much focused on the action sequences: shootings and killings all around (like an out of control video game), things blow up and are destroyed to the ground every 5 minutes and the actors involved act more like mere walking caricatures than fleshed-out characters. In a matter of fact, this sequel looks like it was all directed by the 2nd Unit and the majority of the exteriors, shot somewhere in Eastern Europe, and the extensive use of CGI to emulate the gunshots, the blood and the explosions, gave a sense of cheap with unpolished visuals to the whole, almost entering in the DTV territory. <br/><br/>Most of the on-liners and references to the popular culture of the 80's action movies, immortalized by this guys in their peak, simply doesn't worked here, it was forced and intrusive, like if they tried too much to be self-aware and cool, turning it in almost a spoof movie. Some of the delivering is even awkward and the jokes' cringeworthy.<br/><br/>Despite this, Sly once again did a good job as the Team's Leader, Barney Ross with Jason Statham as the second-in-command, Lee Christmas, who was even more annoying and full of himself than in the first film; Randy Couture as Toll Road, with a limited number of spoken lines to accommodate his acting 'skills'; Terry Crews as Hale Caeser, which at least was funnier than the rest; Jet Li as Yin Yang, only in an extended cameo at the beginning and we must thank his scheduling conflicts for that and the last, but not the least, 'Swedish Strangler' Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jensen, who almost stole the first movie and maybe because of that (he must have irritated the attention seeker, Jason Statham), he was given less to do this time around. <br/><br/>Charisma Carpenter reprises her role as Christmas' girlfriend in a tiny part that if you blink, you'll miss her on-screen and Nan Yu is OK as Maggie, in a good casting decision on opting for her instead of the terrible Gina Carano.<br/><br/>It's nice to watch Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis doing more than a talkative cameo and this time shooting up bad guys, but their hearts aren't there. Arnold besides being lame with his tongue 'n' cheek remarks at least he tried, Bruce was just there for the quick paycheck, in a ""send me a couple of millions and i'll sleepwalk through the movie"" mode.<br/><br/>Chuck Norris, who fares better than Arnold and Bruce, came out of retirement to play John Booker nicknamed ""Lone Wolf"", a homage to his characters in ""Good Guys Wear Black"" ('78) & ""Lone Wolf McQuade"" ('83), but even with his entrance song, the production messed around, ""Ecstasy of Gold"" by Maestro Ennio Morricone is an iconic orchestration for Clint Eastwood's The Man With No Name, not for Chuck Norris and the King Cobra joke was taken directly from the 'Chuck Norris' Facts' on internet, so nothing new or imaginative here. <br/><br/>Liam Hemsworth, a fill-in character for Mickey Rourke who refused to comeback for this sequel, is nicely presented, but the minute he talks that he wants to leave the team, is a token for ""i will be dead very soon"". The casting of Hemsworth had a double function: to call ""The Hunger Games"" fanboys to the theaters and to give ""The Expendables 2"" a feel of ""The Avengers Assemble"" co-starred by Liam's older brother, Chris as Thor.<br/><br/>The baddies played by Jean-Claude Van Damme, who was very good as the sneerie and arrogant Jean Villain, and Scott Adkins, who shamefully he isn't even in the main cover art, if were given more screen time, both would probably steal the movie from The Expendables themselves. The end fighting sequence between Villain and Stallone's Barney Ross is one of the movie's highlights, reminiscent from Van Damme's character in ""Black Eagle"" ('88) where he also played the main baddie.<br/><br/>In short, ""The Expendables 2"" is a good way to spend a hour and a half, like a trip to memory lane, watching this guys in action and reminding us about the hundreds of hours we spend watching and re-watching their action flicks in the videostore days, but as a movie it's just a so-so experience, that wants to please the Gen X, but in fact was technically and visually aimed at the Generation Y.<br/><br/>It got an extra point just because of the ensemble cast, but it deserves less..."

","The Expendables 2 is a welcome improvement on the first film, which is as decent as an action film can get. It has the foundations of a proper, well-developed plot, with good characterisation of most of the major characters. <br/><br/>However it does not properly characterise all the Expendables, leaving several merely ''there'' and nothing else. Still, it does better than the first, which managed to characterise merely protagonists Barney and Lee to a considerable extent. <br/><br/>While the film isn't remarkably better than the first, the action is certainly more interesting and entertaining. The final airport scene climaxes very well, and reunites all the characters from throughout the movie, including Chuck Norris' character, who just coincidentally shows up at the perfect time.<br/><br/>However, while it manages to capture the protagonists very well, the main antagonist isn't quite as terrifying as in the first movie. Regardless, his character is definitely not likable; his name even resembles ''villain''. <br/><br/>Stunts are not particularly remarkable either, in many regards recycling that of the first movie, for example their plane coming in low when shooting. Combat, however, does improve, which can be seen in the airport scene; perhaps the very fact that this scene takes place in the daytime and not the night, like the first film, improves it.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a well-paced action film that is worth a watch. While some may see the plot as just a typical run-of-the-mill action story, the movie itself compensates with good characters and actors, bringing these all together to make a good movie. It may not be perfect, but it is as much as one can expect from an action movie."

","Sylvester Stallone had a brilliant idea that came to fruition in 2010, with an action movie that brought together all the big names in the action movie genre, but there was a problem. You just can't fit every big name into one movie and give them all significant screen time, so you had to have a sequel. The more things change, the more they stay the same, however, as this time, the story was a bit better, at least for an action movie, and the cast was a bit younger, but the basic genre was still the same. Barney Ross's (Sylvester Stallone) team is once again brought together to do a job, this time there are some new younger faces, to complete what seems like what should be an easy job, what they weren't expecting was to stumble right into the middle of a madman's master-plan. As I said, the story wasn't as basic this time, things were a little more complex, but on a basic level this is still you're typical shoot em up action film, with bodies and explosions constantly coming at you. What I did like was how they change things up a bit and didn't just feature the same actors, even though many members of the team were the same. The one thing the first film was severely lacking was youth, and I don't know about you, but I'd much rather see Liam Hemsworth fighting with his shirt off than Sylvester Stallone. All in all, the sequel doesn't differ that much from the original, but where it does, only helps the series. The cast is younger, the story is better, and the action hits harder. If you're an action junkie, it doesn't get more exciting than the Expendables and the sequel will have you craving a trilogy."

Expendables 2 was the best out of the trilogy, starts the action straight away and Expendables 3 was probably the worst out of the three.<br/><br/>The third film seemed more like a casting video, with Stallone travelling around and getting new, younger people for his team.

","Released in 2012, ""The Expendables 2"" stars Sylvester Stallone as Barney Ross, the leader of a group of mercenary veterans who are hired by the CIA to do their dirty work. In this case their mission is to go to Albania to retrieve something that was on a plane that crashed; they're accompanied by technical expert Maggie Chan (Nan Yu) to make sure they get it. When one of their younger members is murdered by a villain so villainous his name is Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme), their quest for revenge brings them to Bulgaria, an abandoned Russian military base, a friendly village and a mine of enslaved workers. Chuck Norris has a glorified cameo while Charisma Carpenter reappears in a small role.<br/><br/>The Expendables franchise is a great way to get all those action stars from the 80s & 90s together for a fun action flick that balances quasi-seriousness with amusing moments and over-the-top action scenes.

If you want to spend 1.5 hours with nonsense-action, it's okay. Lots of explosions, lots of splatter and people heads exploding/decapitating, etc. - and of course the bad guys always keep missing the good guys when shooting them.<br/><br/>The movie is a big reunion of the 80's action actors - even bigger than that of the first movie - with some of them (Schwarzenegger, Norris, Willis) making no more than a guest appearance (but not short enough to be called a cameo).<br/><br/>Schwarzenegger was the worst IMO - not only did he look old, but his acting (yeah, yeah, it's all relative) was more like a governor trying to act in a movie, not an experienced actor making a comeback; his acting seemed forced and all his lines were one-liners, half of them with some obvious reference to the old action movies.

","The Expendables 2 (2012): Dir: Simon West / Cast: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Chuck Norris: The first film was expendable, so it comes to no surprise that the second film is every bit as stupid. The point is to create the biggest roll call of famous names since The Cannonball Run. All of these action stars have had success and developed a big fan base, but why not bring them together within a screenplay that counts? Again we have Sylvester Stallone leading a group of aged veteran actors out to avenge the death of a young member who was thinking about settling down. Jean-Claude Van Damme plays the ruthless villain who wears overly big sunglasses that hopefully cover up his shame. We can predict a big showdown between he and Stallone where they beat the crap out of each other using every blunt object within reach. Even when Jason Statham has a standoff with a henchman we know where it will eventually land. Then we have the assembly line of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, Jet Li, Terry Crews, Dolph Lundgren, Chuck Norris, Elmer Fudd, Deputy Dawg, Marvin the Martian, and any other being of sorts who can seemingly survive anything. Simon West made a good film in The General's Daughter. He has also made trash such as Con Air and Laura Croft: Tomb Raider. It doesn't take long to figure out where this role call action sh*t falls into. He is a capable director of action but after the explosions and special effects a story is needed. Instead we are left with another sh*t storm mess that should be flush away with the first film. Score: 2 / 10"

","I guess if you are into that kind of movie it's pretty okay. Don't get me wrong, it has potential. Great actors, a lot of explosions, not too much story, a lot of fighting scenes, blood, Stallone's mustache still looks like someone drew it on his face with a Sharpie, pew pew, boom and you know the drill. Not much to say about modern day action movies, they all consist of the same irrelevant two-liners that the protagonist blurts out whenever they do something the audience could consider to be ""cool"". They all consist of the same pseudo-love story and pseudo-deep dialogues about the meaning of life and how you should appreciate it when they just finished painting the floor with someones brain seconds ago. I would literally have to elaborate on a few scenes so you get an idea which movie I am actually talking about because it literally mirrors everything every action movie does. It doesn't do worse than it's fellow colleagues, but it doesn't do better either.<br/><br/>BUT! There is this ONE THING... ONE THING that made me quit the film after a good 60 minutes because I was in the serious danger of getting a clich√©-aneurysm. It is the villain of this movie. I don't know why and I don't know how, but whoever wrote the script needs to be send into perpetual vacation. <br/><br/>The antagonist of this movie is apparently a mixture of Satan, Hitler and Stalin himself. I just want to recap the thought process that the director of this movie might have had to show you what I mean:<br/><br/>""Hmm, I need a movie villain, what does he need? He obviously needs to be a self-gracious, smeary d*ck that looks a bit like he was cut out of the Matrix-movies. When you see him, he has to scream ""ARROGANT CLICH√â VILLAIN"" and ""ABOUT TO DIE A HORRIBLY PAINFUL DEATH TO SATISFY THE AUDIENCES SADISTIC TENDENCIES"". How could we achieve that? We could do the usual villain stuff. You know... dealing with Plutonium for weapons of mass destruction (as if he wasn't aware that no matter how much money he has he is still gonna suffer the consequences of nuclear radiation lol, who cares about movie logic anyways), being all greedy 'n stuff... OH OH OH! I know: We are gonna introduce a useless baby-face looking hottie for the ladies that this guy is gonna execute in the most painful way possible 20 minutes into the move for no apparent reason! He obviously has to be so full of himself that he literally is about to bust a nut. But is that enough? <br/><br/>He needs a despicable, ruthless right hand to assist him. That guy should be some sort of Asian... but Asians are usually not the bad guys... uhm... RUSSIANS! It's an Asian looking Russian! Damn this is such a great idea, why has nobody ever come up with that before?!<br/><br/>But I still don't hate him enough... I KNOW! He could be letting people work in a mine until they die, just like in a concentration camp. And if the audience is still not convinced enough that he is going to suffer a cruel and painful death at the end of this film for being so utterly despicable (despite the obvious stamp he has engraved onto his forehead that exactly states that) he should just casually say something like: ""If we don't have enough men, bring the women and children and let them work in the mines too.""<br/><br/>Well done! I just created a guy that is literally less likable then Hitler himself! What could he do next though? Bite off the head of a cute bunny... oooor should he eat a soup with noodles in swastika-shape while reading ""Mein Kampf""? Maybe he should just blow up an orphanage for deaf-mutes to make him the literally least desirable person on earth.<br/><br/>Do you want him to be dead now audience? Please say yes, he impersonates everything that you connect with the word bad...""<br/><br/>This is flat out the single worst character-design I ever had to see in a movie. This guy is, in no bloody way, convincing whatsoever. I am just happy they didn't give him a dumb name like ""BadGuy"" or ""Villain"" or... oh wait. His name is bloody f-ing ""Jean Villain""?! ...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Nope, f*ck that sh*t, I'm out.

Let's be honest, you would have to be brain dead not to know basically what to expect here, the only question is whether or not it is watchable. <br/><br/>In this case the movie starts out pretty strong, but by the time we get to the last third, I'm pretty sure the script just read: shoot a lot of people, blow up a lot of things, try to occasionally toss in some clever or ironic quips and banter (most of which failed due to being far too self-conscious and inauthentically self-deprecating--I wouldn't expect any of these guys to be able to tell a good joke). <br/><br/>I knew that I was just consuming motion picture cotton candy when I started this, but by the end I was diabetic. If they had shown more restraint with the mindless action, especially towards the end, this would have been a much stronger film. <br/><br/>Also, this movie was obviously supposed to have elements of parody to it, but that aspect just fell flat--neither the script nor the actors were up to it. <br/><br/>Lastly, we get a clear demonstration that the only halfway decent actor in the whole bunch is Bruce Willis--if nothing else, he does smirking better than anyone else in the whole world. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Chuck Norris were particularly agonizing to watch. It'd be cruel to put either in a wet paper bag, because neither could act their way out.<br/><br/>With all that said, this movie still mostly held my attention until the end, although it'll be a while before I'll be opening a vein again for another Hollywood big-budget, totally nutritionless, sugar overdose like this one."
"willcundallreview","6","0","0","28 April 2015"," Old guys are doing it for themselves
","Rating-6/10<br/><br/>The Expendables 2 is an action packed movie starring old action movie heroes usually from the 80's and sports massive weaponry. It is all out action, and I mean all out, in an era where films like to have heart this crushes it with action and violence. I think it is fair enough and it is good to see that at least the people behind it weren't ashamed of what they wanted and did it, not to mention excite action movie fans along the way.<br/><br/>The actors are all as I mentioned action movie legends, including the main expendable Sylvester Stallone, he is joined by a variety of cast such as Bruce Willis, Jason Statham and Arnold Schwarzenegger who make the film well, more fighting like. I do think the actors fade slightly to the end and the endless quotes they come out with are just, well I'll come to that later but it is safe to say they aren't afraid of jokey one liners and clich√© lines to boot. A shout to Liam Hemsworth here, he is very confident in his role,and he seems like a star to come for me.<br/><br/>Listen the movie is written poorly, and now I come to them horrible lines that usually sprout from Stallone's mouth and make every scene seem like every film he has ever been in. Some scenes are truly cringe worthy, I mean you will literally be like"" What,how,did I miss something?"" and the over the top fighting and even driving + flying make this so unreal at times it can be 100 percent cringe worthy. <br/><br/>The fighting as it is, is pretty crazy and never seems bashful in it's way of sweeping enemies aside with any way they can. I think it is choreographed well fight wise and with the stunts as well it can all seem well done and I applaud the movie for at least begin exciting in scenes where most people would perish in one second. Simon West directs this OK and some credit could go to him for the excitement, I actually(with a little thought) enjoyed this movie but only just, and it is hard to really pick scenes but West I think within, does an OK job.<br/><br/>Now of course with all this action and thrills come the recommendations if you haven't watched it but reading this review, then I think it is important to know this if you want a film to watch. This film is only for people who can bare hardcore action and death but also laugh at the clich√© lines and shrug it off after the movie. The film has no depth, no real human drama and the emotion gets miss directed in scenes when it could have been sadder, so please, read the label.<br/><br/>Overall I felt it was kind of OK and an acceptable movie, it doesn't get near 7/10 not even a high 6/10 but does escape being just another average action flick. I have very very little doubt they will be making many more of these and probably will go on until they can't literally move or die. What I will say though Is that at least we know what we are getting, top action that fills a quota to literal tipping point and actors who are giving us yet another last hurrah, I'll also add that inside a part of me feels good they are doing this, such classic action stars doing what they do best and what they from what I can see love, just good fun."

","Yes, I know this film is stupid, dumb and I can easily see why some people hate this movie. However, it's just so damn fun & likable that I just can't resist it. <br/><br/>I'm just a sucker for old school action films and to get so many of the great badasses in the film and put them in a genuinely gripping story, well there's just nothing wrong with that. Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Statham, Crewes, and everyone else are back and they are all better. The fight scenes in this film kick ass, it's not as over the top as the previous film and that makes it more engaging. <br/><br/>There are great cameos by the likes of Willis as well as new appearances by legends like Chuck Norris and Liam Hemsworth. Jean Claude Van Damme plays the villain & you can tell he is loving every minute of it. The only problems I have with the film are, I would have liked to have seen more of the villains being badass and doing badass things. Also, I would have liked to have seen more badasses, get Liam Neeson in there, get Michael Jai White, get Tony Ja. <br/><br/>Overall. The Expendables 2 is really stupid but it's more fun than it is stupid."

","Extremely macho!The Expendables 2 is perfect.<br/><br/>Stallone leads a all-star cast of action packed action heroes including the great Jean Claude Van-Dame as the pun intended named Villain, playing the psycho villain (even better, b-action star Scott Adkins who has already been in three Marshall arts movies with the muscles from Brussels plays his henchmen).<br/><br/>Possibly the best mid-life crisis anyone has ever had, The Expendables 2 is the ultimate through back to Stallone's heyday when it was all about balls to the walls action and who was packing the most heat.<br/><br/>Stallone gives it to us like we like it. We know it's campy and outdated, but it brings me back to the great 80s when action was at it's golden era(full realization of that is the fact that this is a sequel, something the 80s was also really good at)<br/><br/>Stallone is joined by other action mega stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis, whose roles were just cameos in the first film are more in the battle this time. Nothing was cooler that watching the three biggest action stars side by side taking out the bad guys.<br/><br/>And if that's not big enough for you than I got two words for you...CHUCK NORRIS. Nothing was better than listening to Chuck recite his own joke about how though he is on screen.<br/><br/>Directed by Simon West it seems that the originally was just a warm up for what this movie is. Fantastic!"
"Bruce722","7","0","0","24 February 2015"," Good but not as good as the first.
","The Expendables 2 has a bunch of explosions, realistic hand-to-hand fight sequences, and guns and gore galore just like the first movie did. However, this sequel did some things better and some things worse. Looking at the good side first, it did actually have a little big better plot development and believe it or not, even more action heroes. Adding Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme to an already loaded cast and then having Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger each get more screen time were all plusses. All of the little inside jokes were absolutely hilarious, as well. The Arnie one-liners, Die Hard references and Chuck Norris jokes were fun little easter eggs for long time action fans. The problem is that this film somehow found a way to have even less character development than the first film, feeling somehow even more shallow. I actually really missed Mickey Rourke's character in this sequel. I thought he added so much to the first film in how he seemed to humanize the cast, especially Stallone's character. I suppose you could argue that Liam Hemsworth's character does that instead but I don't think there should necessarily be a limit on depth. And while those little nods to the 80's were funny, they actually took away from the seriousness of the film. Seeing Rambo, the Terminator, and John McClane all shooting bad guys side-by-side may have seemed awesome but there was simply too much of the over-the-top element in this movie. I felt the first film found the perfect balance between giving each action hero their due while staying true to making a great movie. This film, unfortunately felt like a parody of the first at times, rather than its own movie."

","(76%) While the original gave about half its exciting potential, this goes a touch further. The cast is just as overstuffed, the action even more overblown, and the plot is just as thin. Where this goes further is actually including Bruce Willis and Arnie in the action, which was something badly missing from the first instalment. The action in general is good, if a little tiring, and the fake CGI blood could have been toned down a little for more practical effects, but this still delivers more than enough thrills. Van Damme is a good addition as the main bad guy, even if the writing is too lacking for this to hook a universal audience, but as something for fans of action flicks this is something to savour."
"c-conley90","5","0","0","16 December 2014"," Several factors cripple this nearly great sequel to the first.
","I would have liked this movie well enough and all if it was not for the casting of bad actor champ Chuck Norris. Yes ladies and gentlemen he's here to be praised like a god by all the other action stars, talk about an ego. The fact that Stallone has to kowtow to him in this movie and say ""he's the greatest"" basically is laughable. The rest of the movie is an alright mix of action and plotting. Though I find the sudden disappearance of Jet Li to be another ouch for this movie, but it compared to Chuck Norris being treated like some deity is small potatoes. Plus, Mickey Rourke being gone is another negative and Dolph lacks much substance to his character this time out. It was rather great the first movie actual had some substance with the characters. But not this one. <br/><br/>But yes pretty much a OK sequel that sunk itself big time with Chuck Norris jokes and his lame ass showing up to the Good, the bad and the ugly theme?!!!"
"CinemaClown","Null","0","0","7 November 2014"," Bigger, Better & Bloodier Than The Expendables
","Bigger, better & bloodier, The Expendables 2 is an explosive sequel to its predecessor that improves upon the original in almost every department & is a worthy addition to the newly established franchise. Continuing its homage to past action classics, the film hugely improves on the action, violence & humour aspects and the new recruits to its ensemble cast are unquestionably a welcome addition.<br/><br/>The Expendables 2 continues the journey of the notorious band of elite mercenaries who are reunited for a new assignment which seems like a seemingly simple operation but when one of their own is murdered on the job, the mission evolves into a quest for revenge as the group tries to avenge their loss by going one on one against a formidable enemy who's also in possession of a deadly weapon.<br/><br/>Directed by Simon West, the film opens on a high note with an impressive action sequence and never loses its high-octane fuel throughout its runtime. The direction is good, writing takes the premise into darker territories, the humour & references are nicely handled, camera-work is dynamic, editing improves the pacing & Brian Tyler's score provides the adrenaline rush in just the right doses.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the reprising cast continues its job in the same fashion as before & it was pretty refreshing to see more of Schwarzenegger & Willis in this one. But what makes the ensemble all the more solid are the new additions in Liam Hemsworth as the latest member of Expendables, Chuck Norris in a hilarious cameo & Jean-Claude Van Damme as the main antagonist, at which the veteran brilliantly excels.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Expendables 2 is an intensely enjoyable, highly entertaining & immensely satisfying action flick which delivers everything it promised and is better than the original in every way. From the excellent opening sequence to the final showdown between Stallone & Van Damme, it never tries to hold back the blood, gore or violence which I really appreciate. A definite must for fans of the original."
"jray1410","7","0","0","1 October 2014"," An explosion packed sequel that leaves you wanting more
","If you're a fan of big booms and complete unrealistic gun battles then read no more and get over to your nearest Movie Theater or Netflix capable device because this is the movie for you. If you prefer to have some actual plot then while you will not be absolutely disgusted with this movie you could probably do without. If your one of those people who likes for movies to be realistic and have a deep and meaningful plot line then you are better off passing on this one. While there is definitely a storyline and a few deep moments throughout the movie they are simply overshadowed by the number of explosions and gun battles. Personally I love to see the pyrotechnics go a little nuts with the explosives. Not to mention that the cast for this movie includes just about every main character from every major classic action movie. Msia91 could not have said it better his/herself when they said ""Their screen presence needs no explanation: Sylvester Stallone. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Bruce Willis. Jean-Claude Van Damme. Chuck Norris. Dolph Lundgren. Jason Statham. Jet Li. Need I say more? Cult or mainstream, these guys each has hordes of fans ‚Äì and they have good reason to.""(IMDb). Going into this movie you have to expect and understand that the priority was not plot line drama it was coolness plain and simple. <br/><br/>This is perfectly demonstrated throughout the movie by the jokes between the characters referencing the past movies they have starred in. As Neil Pond wrote on the website Rotten Tomatoes on behalf of American Profile ""there's a vein of humor running throughout the script and almost as many quips zipping around as bullets.""(RottenTomatoes.com, 1). With so many famous movie lines coming from characters in this movie it is almost impossible not to expect to see them in a movie like this. One of the elements of this movie that makes it so ridiculous is that the jokes and movie references will come at the most dramatic points in the movie. For example in the final shootout when Schwarzenegger runs out of ammo he tells Bruce Willis ""I'll be back.""(The Expendables 2). To which Willis responds ""You've been back enough. I'll be back"" (The Expendables 2) and walks off. Schwarzenegger cleverly replies ""Yippie-ki-yay"" (The Expendables 2) and is promptly joined by Chuck Norris. At this point Schwarzenegger has just about had enough and jokingly remarks ""who is next? Rambo?"" (The Expendables 2). It is this kind of banter that makes this movie so laughable yet enjoyable at the same time. The best part is that most of the time you can see the joke coming before it is even said on screen so you know it is going to be bad before it even happens. <br/><br/>The other important feature about this movie is that it had to live up to the precedent set be the first movie. In fact numerous critics even said that the explosions and violence of this movie did not exceed that of the first Expendables. For the most part the critics who supported this movie were those that were big fans of explosives rather than dialogue, or those that recognized that this was not intended to be an Academy Award winning film unless there is a new category for biggest boom. <br/><br/>I think that Adam Ross said it best when in his review of the movie he said ""if seeing a man's head explode like a watermelon is your thing, book a ticket, because The Expendables 2 frequently makes fruit salad."" (RottenTomatoes.com, 2). I believe that what Ross is getting at is that this movie knows its target audience, it knows what they want to see, and it knows how to make a big fire ball. I think that that is the main reason for the wide range of critic reviews. As a family movie, horrible definitely not. However for a group of high school guys on a rainy afternoon definitely a good way to pass the time. That being said this movie definitely isn't for everyone especially the faint of heart. The key to understanding and enjoying this movie is to know what you're getting into before you dig into the popcorn. Don't set your expectations to high as almost all the actors are better at pumping iron then delivering a punch line. Personally I tip my hat to Sylvester Stallone for directing and starring in a movie that will appeal to the little kid in you while still making you feel old for knowing who Rambo is."

","A team of highly trained mercenaries, led by grizzled battle veteran Barney Ross (Sly Stallone), are tasked with retrieving a computer that details the location of a stockpile of Russian weapons-grade plutonium. Their mission is a failure however when The Sangs, an army of brutal killers (boo hiss!), led by the sadistic Villain (ah, why not go the whole hog and just call him Villain?), snatches their prize, killing The Expendables youngest member, Billy (Liam Hemsworth), in the process. Mightily upset, Barney and pals go looking to settle the score¬Ö<br/><br/>The first Expendables movie was a bloody mess, thanks to a weak plot and Sly Stallone's excessive use of scrappy CGI, digital blood effects, and grainy shaky cam, a technique that made every action scene impossible to follow; when you make a Jet Li fight scene look unimpressive, then you've got problems. The iffy CGI and digital gore is still present in Expendables 2, but this time around it's Simon West (Con Air) behind the camera, and although he's never been nominated for an Oscar, he does a much better job than Sly at delivering the action-packed goods. The level of enjoyment to be had is so much higher when you can actually tell what is happening.<br/><br/>For maximum satisfaction, ignore the moral dilemma of both The Expendables and The Sangs essentially being cut from the same cloth, both sides being bloodthirsty killers for hire, happily blasting their way through countless adversaries in order to line their own pockets‚Äîjust settle back and admire the excessive cartoonish chaos. It's all very silly at times, of course, and not what you could ever describe as genuinely thrilling, but there's so much outrageous violence on offer that any self-respecting action movie fan should be more than happy, especially with Arnie, Bruce and even Chuck finally getting in on the explosive action as well.<br/><br/>6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb."

","Continuing my plan to watch every Sly movie in in order, I come to 2012's Expendables 2.<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: When a seemingly easy mission goes wrong, and one of their men is murdered, Barney Ross and the rest of the Expendables set out for revenge.<br/><br/>Those movie has two things going for it over the first movie. Jean Claude Van Damme is in top form as the bad guy, Villain. And we finally see Sly, Arnie and Bruce Willis in action side by side. <br/><br/>That said, for this Reviewer, it's much weaker than the first movie. Much more emphasis is placed on comedy and again (obviously with the exception of the one who does die) you never feel any of the Expendables are in any danger. Even when they are buried alive there is no real tension, as Sly sits smoking a stogie while playing with his lighter. There was more drama in Toy Story 3 (which I watched last night) when Woody, Buzz and the gang were holding hands in the incinerator heading towards their fate.<br/><br/>Scott Adkins's character (whose name I can't recall, despite just watching it) is basically the same guy Gary Daniels played in the first movie!! I can't remember his characters name either. <br/><br/>Once again, I liked everything about the soundtrack from the songs used to the score. I do not mind Sly rockin the tache!! (How can I, when I love Burt Reynolds) I liked Liam Hemsworth as Billy The Kid, I thought he was decent, though his story about the dog got a laugh in my screening. I remember the original storyline had Tool being killed off as the motivation for the team's subsequent actions. This was changed when Mickey Rourke left to pursue another project. Then I remember Taylor Lautner (Twilight) was pursued, which angered a lot of fans, before Hemsworth was cast. <br/><br/>I'm surprised this didn't lead to a come back of sorts for Van Damme, as he was very good in it. I liked the Chuck Norris bits, and Nan Yu was fine as Maggie too. <br/><br/>The heart to heart scene with Sly's and Maggie is not a patch on the scene with Rourke in the first movie, it's not even as good as the ""Expendable"" scene between Sly's Rambo and Julia Nickson's Co on the boat in ""First Blood part 2"". But it's an attempt at character development, so you have to appreciate it for what it is.<br/><br/>I think the whole PG-13 controversy, only to be changed at the last minute, hurt the movie. As it doesn't know what it wants to be, and the CGI blood added at the last minute looks poor. I know Norris seemed to be blamed on line, but since Avi Lerner had 2 cuts of the first movie made (one a PG-13) I'm guessing he was behind that one too!! Don't have ""Yipeee Kia Yay"" in if you are not gonna drop the f bomb!!<br/><br/>My last gripe is the final fight between Sly and Van Damme, far too short, and Van Damme is dispatched far too easily by Sly!! I think Van Damme himself summed the fight up ""Over so soon??.... I want my money's worth!!"" It's how I felt!! Short changed. I'd have liked maybe Sly and Van Damme's old nemesis from Universal Soldier, Dolph Lundgren teaming up against Van Damme, like Statham and Li did against Gary Daniels in the first one.Speaking of Lundgren, his insane Gunner from he first movie was dumbed down for comedy effect. <br/><br/>Finishing with a domestic gross of $85million, Expendables 2 ended the year the 36th highest grossing movie of the year. Which whilst down on the first movie's numbers, was still a decent success.<br/><br/>Not as good as the first (which is disappointing considering this has a better cast) and not the best work of any of the main stars, but an OK way to spend 90 mins. <br/><br/>7/10. I nearly voted it 6/10, but it does have its moments."
"CowherPowerForever","8","0","0","13 August 2014"," Norris. Schwarzenegger. Willis. Van Damme. Adkins.
","Two years after Sylvester Stallone brought us the first Expendables film, he is back at it once again. This time with even more action legends like Chuck Norris and bigger roles for Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and also action legend Jean-Claude Van Damme. While the action overall isn't much as the first film, when the action picks up it is just like watching all of these stars back in the 80s and 90s again. This is my review of The Expendables 2.<br/><br/>In addition to Stallone writing once again, he also adds Richard Wenk, Ken Kaufman, and David Agosto to the mix. While Agosto only has previous experience with one prior film, a short film, Wenk worked with one of the actors in this, Jason Staham, on the popular movie The Mechanic, as well as the Bruce Willis film 16 Blocks. Kaufman has much less experience but, has some more well known films under his belt like The Missing and Space Cowboys. This film overall has more down time than the previous film, and the writing takes a step downward in my opinion. Thankfully the action and the amazing actors are enough to hold our attention for the duration of this film. The characters are mostly written loosely and that is to be expected in this genre. This new writing team gets a barely passable grade.<br/><br/>On to direct this sequel is Simon West, who takes over for Sylvester Stallone. In my opinion Stallone laid out a better overall action inspired film but, that is not to say West did a bad job. Simon West is no slouch either when it comes to action films. He directed the action classic from the 90s, Con-Air. While the overall action is much less than the first movie, the film literally starts and finishes with amazing and fun action scenes. West really holds his own, and proves to everyone that he can still direct an action film. The casting is much bigger this time. Not only do Schwarzenegger and Willis have bigger roles but, the legend himself, Chuck Norris is in the film. Sure he doesn't have much screen time but, he is a joy to see on the big screen again. He also delivers some hilarious lines. Speaking of which, real quick I want to speak on that. The cheesy lines in this movie is a giant step up over the previous film, which is fantastic. Now back to the actors. Also in the film, and playing a very good bad guy is Jean-Claude Van Damme. While he mostly played the good guy over the course of his career, he has shown he can play the bad guy as well. He does it once again in this film. Also in this film is Scott Adkins. He has worked in the past with Van Damme and he does a nice job in this film, and even has a fantastic hand to hand combat fighting scene. With returning cast members like Stallone, Statham, Lundgren, Crews, and Couture, this is one amazing action film with outstanding legends gracing the big screen. While I thought the amount of action was less in this film, this film is still so much fun, and re-watching this film again made me so much more excited for the future of this franchise. Simon West gets a big thumbs up in my opinion and so do these action legends.<br/><br/>Brian Tyler is back to compose this sequel. As I mentioned in my review for the previous film, Tyler really didn't impress me all that much in that film. However, this time around I really enjoyed what he did. I still cannot say his effort was great or perfect but, I did feel it was a step in the right direction, and cannot wait to hear what he has in store for the future films. Brain Tyler gets a good rating in my book for his efforts in this film.<br/><br/>Overall, just like the previous film, hardcore action fans like myself will love this movie even though the amount of action is less than the previous film. For those on the fence, this is simply a great time to start watching because this film features one of the greatest action stars of all time, Chuck Norris. This film feels more funny with some better one liners, and in my opinion most should really have a blast watching this film.<br/><br/>8/10"

In this movie we add iconic heroes such as Chuck Norris, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jean-Claude Van Damme as well as new blood in Liam Hemsworth. Personally I think these types of movies are a great way to just have irrational fun watching popcorn flicks. Everything ranging from the blow em up style of Stallone and Lundgren, to the specialized tactics of Statham as well as the experience of Norris and Schwarzenegger, and you get all you need in a movie full of action. My only complain was the lack of Jet Li, who just seemed to pop up at the start of the film to earn his paycheck, which is a shame because I would have loved to see Van Damme vs Li, even though it's Stallone who is the main hero. So if you're looking to see some old fashioned ass-kicking from your favorite action legends, then this is it. Now let's eat some popcorn and watch stuff blow up.<br/><br/>Rating 7/10"

","A: Let them watch Expendables 2.<br/><br/>Okay, let me just say that, as a grown man, I felt suitably ashamed for loving The Expendables 2 as much as I did. Perhaps it was growing up in the eighties with Schwarzenegger and Van Damme as action heroes to my generation? Either way, for the first time on screen, we get to see Stallone, Arnie and Bruce Willis fighting side by side... in a Smart car.<br/><br/>And there we have it - a Smart car. That alone should tell you not to take The Expendables 2 too seriously. It's deliberately over the top, silly and daft. Chuck Norris is so hard he can wipe out an entire army in one go. Too much? If you think so, you'd better not watch this film. As for me, I find it perfectly plausible that someone as tough as Chuck can take out a tank and a platoon in less than five seconds, so, that's why The Expendables 2 is for me.<br/><br/>Men and boys will be one and the same when they watch this. The action is wonderfully over the top and the cheesy one-liners flow almost as much as the fake blood from the hundred and one stooges who get used as cannon fodder for our heroes.<br/><br/>I can't see how any self-respecting action junkie won't love this. I'm sure it's one for the boys. Especially as a female friend of mine watched it and commented how she wasn't happy that Jason Statham wasn't in it as much as he was in the first one. With more heroes, the screen time for Statham (and Jet Li) is cut slightly short.<br/><br/>Either way, it's action-packed fun that you shouldn't take too seriously.<br/><br/>Roll on Expendables 3.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

This film takes care of what the original messed up as the lulls in the original is gone and replaced with more action and more of the team working together which I wanted in the original. This film starts off with an action scene that trumps anything in the previous film and really set up this awesome action extravaganza. There are some more emotional moments and comedic moments with the epic one liners by especially Schwarzenegger and Willis. Also jean Claude vanne damme owns his role as the villain and he is clearly having fun with his role, but the most awesome part of this film is when Schwarzenegger, Willis, Stallone and a bit of chuck Norris team up and it is every action fans dream and it lives up to it immensely.

"ikrani","4","0","0","12 March 2014"," What Happened?
","Let me start by saying that I liked the Expendables. In fact, I just finished writing a review for it. It was well-paced, had excellent escalation, and the characters were so clich√©d that I HAD to love them.<br/><br/>Then I heard all the hype around Expendables 2 and checked it out, and frankly... It's a lot weaker. Gone is the weight of the characters' past discrepancies or the drama that Robert Vaughn brought to the first movie. While Van Damme made a great villain despite his mediocre acting abilities, there was something about ex-CIA Agent Monroe that made him feel a lot more threatening. Every time Vaughn was on the screen, I felt like he was saying, ""Yeah, I'm so badass that I don't even need to get involved in all this."" When Van Damme is on, I'm constantly reminded that he's not a fear-mongering mastermind, but a less ethical merc than Stallone. And, come on, ""Vilain""? His name is ""VILAIN""?!<br/><br/>Chuck Norris is a terrible actor. I can't even pin down what his character's personality was like in this or any other project he worked on. I'm convinced the only reason he made it into this film was because of all those bullcrap Chuck Norris facts which, after seeing Chuck Norris's performance, leave me baffled as to why he's so popular. Charlie McCarthy's acting was less wooden!<br/><br/>Worst of all is the escalation. Yhe first movie started with a basic gunfight and ended with a giant, over-the-top blow-'em-up against an inferior foe, just like an '80s movie, whereas the sequel starts with a giant, over-the-top driving-motorcycles-into-helicopters-because-who-gives-a-crap blow-'em-up and ends with a basic gunfight at an airport, with not one explosion to be seen. I understand that it's an '80s action movie and that the characters are invincible, but when you establish your bad guys as legit threats and then have the heroes gun them down without even looking for cover, it really kills my investment. That and all the ""comedic"" references to the actors' past works really annoyed me.<br/><br/>If this is the style to which Expendables 3 is made, I don't think I'm going to go see it. Ah, who am I kidding? OF COURSE I'm going to go see it. But I'll be going with a due sense of exhaustion and dread, especially if they get another ""comedic"" director.<br/><br/>Now, if they put Bruce Campbell or Mr. T in it, however..."

","Before writing this review, first of all I will tell that this by no means is a great movie. It's not a dramatic masterpiece of storytelling, nor it aspires to be one. It's a movie that is build on a few simple rules. Guns go bang, explosives go boom, and the hero's are all badasses.<br/><br/>Having said that, it's the ultimate brainless summer flick we can all remember where extremely popular in the 80's and early 90's, and both director and actors have no delusions of it being anything else than that. It all harps back to simpler days where baddies couldn't hit a barn and the heroes are all crack-shot shooters.<br/><br/>The plot starts with the group having to retrieve an item before it falls into the wrong hands, the mission goes awry and the newest member of the group perishes as a result. And the quest for revenge is what drives the film through a plethora of exciting action scenes and firefights which all culminates in the obligatory Hero Vs. Big Bad fistfight to the death.<br/><br/>The main villain (Played by 80's/90's action icon van Damme) is aptly named ''Vilain'' and the acting is equally as corny as you might expect. And in this movie, that's a good thing. The bad guy is assisted by a Russian comrade with an accent that could only be described as ridiculous, and both men have a nigh infinite among of units at their disposal, ready to die for their masters.<br/><br/>The heroes are what they are, they are all badasses in their own rights and most of the characters are perfect caricatures of 80's heroes. You got the tough boss, you got the knife expert, the explosives expert and so on. All of the actors play their role to a t, and they all fit in some way or shape. A few cameos from known (badass) actors (Norris, Arnold, Willis) are done perfectly.<br/><br/>The film is rife with silly errors like infinite ammunition, weird continuity errors and the like... But in a film like this, the errors feel right.<br/><br/>This film won't win an Oscar, and it won't bring you to tears with it's dramatic delivery. What it does give you is a good brainless action flick that gives you a lot of bang for your buck, and leaves you with a content smile on your face at the end.<br/><br/>In the end, lots of bad guys get killed and the heroes stand tall over evil. And that's all you want out of this movie.<br/><br/>As such, looking at it what it is... It's the ultimate summer action flick. 8/10"

","I really didn't have my hopes high going in, I'll admit. The first expendables did not impress me one bit. I was hoping that Nan Yu's Maggie would bring some fresh air to this testosterone line up, but her character wasn't utilized very well. In the end, Expendables 2 winds up being a pointless clone of the original. It's a generic action flick with an all star cast. The end. There isn't one character in here worth remembering. There isn't one action scene that has any thought or effort put into it. If you just want to see such heroes come together, there's no need to see both movies. Oh and for the record, adding more famous action stars does not make a movie any better."
"MovieMaster95","3","0","0","29 November 2013"," Dear Mr. Stallone, why do you like to disappoint me so?
","So my reaction to the first Expendables was very lukewarm. I liked the fact that Stallone was bringing back all these action stars to come together in some epic ensemble movie. But sadly, it failed to really excite me as a huge action movie buff. The action was poorly shot and the whole thing felt rushed. Still, I was excited to see what Stallone would do for the sequel. Maybe it would be better.<br/><br/>Alas, I was wrong. This was another disappointment. It started out good with some over-the-top action and plenty of good old fashioned silliness but sadly the plot showed up. The plot (if you can call it that) is a 'done to death' revenge plot where one of the crew members is killed (just before he retired) so the team go out of there way to hunt down evil Jean Claude Van Damme to kill him. Just good old fashioned family fun. Speaking of Van Damme, he's easily one of the best parts of the movie. I've alway found Van Damme to be somewhat charismatic and he's really good a playing a sinister baddie. It's just a shame he gets so little screen time.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is just the team moving from one action scene to the next. The action has is shot in a much better way when compared to the first film but unfortunately, there are fewer memorable moments. And what's with all the CG gore. Give me some real blood squibs Stallone, stop being lazy. They meet up with Chuck Norris at one point, which is fun but also pointless. I like the fact that he spoofs his own internet persona but that BS about him censoring the swearing is still an issue. So swearing is bad, but killing people in over-the-top violent ways is fine?<br/><br/>Then there's the climax, which honestly I had the most problems with. Like the original film, it felt rushed. It should be really cool seeing Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Willis gunning down baddies together but it ends up not being too memorable. There are some cool moments, like Arnie ripping the door off a car and then proceeding to shoot a ton of enemies while Willis drives. Speaking of Arnie, he's another great part of the movie, just because of how corny and terrible his delivery is. Believe me, I love the guy, he's my childhood hero but I can't help but laugh at how ridiculous it is to see him doing his 'Commando' routine at his age.<br/><br/>Then there's the fight between Stallone and Van Damme. What a letdown. Stallone's ego seems to be in action here, since for the most part, he has the upper hand. Van Damme only manages to hit him a few times with his trademark helicopter kicks. But eventually, Stallone kills Van Damme. And then the worst part of the movie. Stallone cutting off Van Damme's head and putting it in a bag. WHAT? Remember in the first Expendables movie where everyone thought Dolph Lungdren hanging the pirates was 'sick'. But now it's okay to cut off an already dead man's head and carry it around in a bag. It's overly sadistic and made the character out to be a complete psychopath. <br/><br/>Anyway overall the movie is 'meh'. Really nothing special aside from the cast. And like the original, the cast is still not used effectively. This should be a love letter from Stallone to every action fan including myself. But it ends up just being nothing special and kind of dull in a lot of ways. The movie has its moments but that doesn't stop the direct to DVD feel I get from it. And after watching the other disappointment that was 'Bullet to the Head', I've lost all enthusiasm for Stallone's work. Expendables 3 is on the way and honestly, I don't care."

"OllieSuave-007","9","0","0","19 October 2013"," Action-packed film with some great action legends!
","The Expendables 2 is one action-packed film, a story about a group of mercenaries looking to find a computer chip to unlocking a load of weapons-grade plutonium, but also ending up being a mission of revenge as well. <br/><br/>It's a movie with an exciting and no-nonsense plot, mixing in drama and humor where needed. While it is not a masterpiece, and I don't believe it was meant or attempted made to be one, it is great is see many of the action legends from the 1980s together (Stallone, Lundgren, Norris, Willis, Scharzenegger and Van Damme). It gives you a very nostalgic feeling, helped with the soundtrack loaded with oldies music from the 1980s and prior. Statham, Li, Crews, Couture, Hemsworth and Yu gave an equally memorable performance. The acting can be a little campy at times, but is not too over-the-top.<br/><br/>Lots of weaponry and martial-arts action, with some scenes showing courage and surprises, supported by a simple but compelling story. There are hilarious one-liners, including ones spoofed from other movies (i.e., Arnold's famous ""I'll Be Back"" line). <br/><br/>The only downside to this film, I think, is that the lead villain and his purpose in the story were not emphasized enough. Other than that, I would occasionally pop in this movie on a slow night, and it's thoroughly entertaining every time I watch it. <br/><br/>Grade A-"
"RyanEberhart","9","0","0","25 September 2013"," Way better than the first...
","Expendables 2 was a lot better than the first movie, the number of action stars who were cast in this movie increased and for the better. I like the addition of Jean-Claude Van Damme, Liam Hemsworth, Chuck Norris and Nan Yu to this movie; as well as the expanded roles of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. The plot was better than the first movie as well.<br/><br/>The script itself could have been better, at least as far as some of the duologue, but for the most part was pretty satisfying. I have mixed feelings about some of the actors saying lines that the another actor said in other movie series. For instance, Bruce Willis says ""I'll be back"" to Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Arnold says ""Yippee-ki-yay.""<br/><br/>I have several scenes I like in this movie, but I will only describe three.<br/><br/>The first scene I liked, or really the first part of a scene I liked was the end of the rescue scene at the beginning of the movie. The Expendables are sent to rescue Dr. Zhou (Wenbo Li), they complete the mission, but also rescue Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger). To escape the compound that Dr. Zhou was being held hostage in the Expendables use some power lines as zip lines. Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) end up on the ground surrounded by enemy soldiers, they are ordered to drop their weapons and they do, Barney holds his index finger pointed out like a gun and does the motion of shooting the soldiers with his finger. The soldiers are shot but by a sniper named Billy the Kid (Liam Hemsworth).<br/><br/>My next favorite scene is when the Expendables are on their plane heading to Albania. Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren) attempts to flirt with Maggie (Nan Yu), but she rebuffs him. Maggie, however, befriends Billy the Kid just to spite Gunnar. Billy tells Maggie why he left the Army and it pretty much effects every member in the exact same way, not a dry eye was had within ear shot.<br/><br/>Another favorite scene is after Billy is killed by Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme) the Expendables vow to hunt Villain down. The Expendables end up staying the night in a mock-New York City training center somewhere in Eastern Europe, probably a hold over from the Cold War. The next morning as everyone is getting ready to attack Villain's group, Gunnar is still asleep on the floor snoring away. Barney yells out and wakes Gunnar up, to which Gunnar bellows ""You Rang"". I found this to be very hilarious.<br/><br/>I won't tell you how this movie ends because it was that good. I will tell you that Chuck Norris, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Bruce Willis played a huge role in the finale of the movie.<br/><br/>I give this 9 stars out of 10. The blood still looked fake."

","10 out of 10, you say? This film?<br/><br/>First, we must recognize The Expendables 2 for what it really is: We're not going to see anything new here, there isn't going to be a fantastic plot, and the acting will be corny at times. With that said, the Expendables is not to be judged by its plot or acting. For me the greatness of the film comes from being able to see so many of the great action actors in one ridiculous movie. Seeing so many of your favorite actors in one project is the real reason for seeing this film.<br/><br/>Though no great cinematic achievement, The Expendables 2 is a great improvement from the first one. It is much less dark, the humor is better, and the villain is much more interesting. <br/><br/>A cast like this will never be found in any other movie series. Just enjoy the explosive 80s- style action."
"Maziun","7","0","0","28 July 2013"," Good tribute to old school action movies
","""The Expendables 2"" is a slight improvement over the first movie. It's very funny , very charming B-class movie that is proud of what it is. A big , funny , nicely made summer blockbuster that wants to entertain as an action fairytale. <br/><br/>People who don't like this movie because it's unrealistic , cheesy and over the top forgot one thing ‚Äì it was INTENTIONAL . The movie is a great love letter to old school action movies . To the movies that were full of testosterone . When one hero could defeat a whole army . Where one-liners and jokes were brilliantly cheesy and bad . Where heroes were larger than life and so were the villains. The movie keeps joking about itself and makes countless references to classic action movies.<br/><br/>Stallone has been replaced by Simon West (""Con air"") as the director. It's a good decision , because his direction is superior than Stallone's from the first movie. ""Expendables 2"" is full of energy , and never boring or too serious for it's own good (another flaw of the original movie). There are some moral dilemmas here , but thankfully they aren't heavy handed and give the movie some kind of heart and depth.<br/><br/>The movie makes a better use of the all star cast. Dolph Lundgren is great as comic relief . Jason Statham has two really nice fights. Jet Li appears for only first 15 minutes , but was able to show his fighting skills. Stallone is more convincing as the leader of the group. Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger who were wasted in the first movie actually take part in action and give us their charisma and famous one liners.<br/><br/>The newcomers are also fun . Chuck Norris is adorable when he makes fun of himself. Jean Claude Van Damme is really good as the villain and definitely a better choice for that role than Eric Roberts.<br/><br/>There are some flaws. One new hero isn't really that interesting and the subplot involving him left me cold. Van Damme doesn't have too much time . Some jokes are rather flat. There is a love story here that is definitely undeveloped and feels unnecessary.<br/><br/>Plenty of cartoon violence , destruction and carnage. Big explosions . Lovely silly dialogue . I felt like a kid once again. They simply don't make them like this anymore. It's a shame. Too many action movies are dead serious and this one was a welcomed change of style.<br/><br/>If you like ""Commando"" , ""Cobra"" , ""Tango and Cash"" and so on you'll be satisfied . If you like more serious action movies , please go somewhere else. I give it 7/10."
"HunterCandelaria","10","0","0","20 July 2013"," It takes our hero Barney Ross and his mercenary team to a foreign country to get revenge on Villain due to the fall of one of his teammate.
","In my opinion, E2 is one of the best actions movies to come. It has all your favorite action stars: Sylvester Stallone (who step down from Directing but still continued to write it), Arnold Swart. (don't worry ""he's back""), Bruce Willis and even Chuck Norris (the walking punch line). The story is basic but you don't go for story you go for action, and your wishes are granted. There is amazing top-notch action that overlap the original 2x and obviously the stars bring their awesomeness to the action as well. Now for the actors, of course everyone brings their A game into it and when you see the three top action stars (Sylvester, Arnold and Bruce) on screen- in one frame you see that they weren't acting but playing themselves. And finally I have to talk about the Villain, who is called Villain. Now for antagonist that Sylvester writes, their name describes it all they are not the good guys and want to nothing but defeat the hero. I mean Drago from Rocky 4, just one letter off from DRAGON, now we have Villain who is just one letter off from VILLAIN (note the actor who played Drago is in this movie as Gunnar). So if you wanna see an amazing action movie check it out."
"DrPhilter","5","0","0","8 July 2013"," What happened?
","I went into this movie with high hopes. I LOVED the first one. I am a late 80s/early 90s kid so movies like Commando, Terminator, First Blood, Lethal Weapon, Timecop, Tango and Cash, you name it were some of my favorite movies. When it comes to Action flicks I am very complex in what I can overlook in the name of entertainment and what I expect for quality.<br/><br/>Now, as I write this I realize that Expendables 2 actually would work better as a prequel. The way it is written (aside from utterly poor) all of the protagonists come off as amateurs. They make stupid mistakes that weren't forgivable in the 80s and certainly aren't in this day and age. When on missions they don't employ stealth at all, they will just yell for their comrades not considering enemies could be lingering. I could write the whole list of these, but stupid actions bring these characters down from the badasses they were in number 1.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this movie can be summed up with four words. Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis and Norris. They treated every scene they shared together as a chance to launch their stand up comedy careers and it just felt completely out of place. Yes, I get it that you had a lot of successful movies, you had a lot of popular movie quotes, there are internet memes regarding how badass you are, those things are why we want to see you but when you then acknowledge them and ham up the screen, it almost breaks the fourth wall and come off like the annoying 6 year old hurting for praise and attention. I mean, Stallone did this back in the Tango And Cash days and that ONE line was a bit of an eyeroller, but coupled with the fact that he was playing a preppy cop, it worked much better. Don't get me wrong, I think well written and placed humor in action movies are great! That is the key though and when you have an incredibly poor script any hopes of good humor are out the window. This movie needed to play it straight. Rely heavily, first and foremost on action and sprinkle the laughs within. You want to throw a couple laughs in at the end during the big battle, that's fine, but when there are as many terrible jokes being told as bullets flying, just turns me off.<br/><br/>I also have overall problems with the plot of the movie. Church (Willis) apparently blackmails the Expendables because of how the events unfolded in the first movie, but wasn't that more or less a success? Their army was all but destroyed and both leader figures were taken out. Did I miss something? I really enjoyed Willis' (albeit short) role int he first movie. He has never been the physical match for the big three, but he certainly comes off as the smartest but it seems like they just wanted to amp up the animosity between Church and Barney Ross for tension which didn't add up in the first act (feeling contrived) and makes the final act all the more jarring.<br/><br/>I'm not saying the first movie was genius, but Stallone writing and directing the thing did it with style and successfully and it came off as intelligent as you could. So I can only assume since the variable in this equation is the director, that has to be a major cause for the quality drop. I can only hope that moving forward we can get back to the level the first one was at but I will find out either way from my couch when it ends up on Netflix because I am definitely done with Expendables at the theater."

","Expendables 2<br/><br/>Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Chuck Norris, Terry Crews, Randy Couture and Liam Hemsworth with Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/>Synopsis: When CIA member Church (Brue Willis) catches up with the crew of the ""Expendables"" and enlists them for a routine mission, however when the youngest member of the team is caught and murdered and they're forced to give up what they came for it becomes a personal quest for revenge which will see them deep into the enemy territory. <br/><br/>Review: Bringing together returning members of the ""Expendables"" from the first film and introducing new member from 80's and 90's A-list action film stars, and 00's B-list action film stars, the ""Expendables"" come face-to-face with a new threat in the form of Jean Villain (Vam Damme). It's a film that hits high on all clich√©'s of 80's action genre and is a likable romp for it. The second outings as better acting or at least acted better from Bill the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) and a returning star who seems to be having fun with his role of Gunnar Jenson (Dolph Lundgren) shame that the rest are either over-acting or performing their same old routine. A predictable story with a lot of unrealistic fights and action sequences however with enough fun to keep you seated and watching.<br/><br/>Whilst watching I was thinking it doesn't need a story line with the cast line-up, sixty minutes of fighting and violence would be enough to keep any action fan from walking out or not buying this on DVD/Blu Ray. It's a better film than the first film was, however with nothing new happening through the duration of the film to make it original or overly exciting, I wouldn't be surprised if after a week you've forgotten you'd seen this film. There is a few cringe worthy laughable moments, when they each start using each other's catchphrases and someone threatens Trench (Schwarzenegger) that he'll be ""Terminated"".<br/><br/>Chuck Norris steals the show as a one man special weapon army, Norris's role in this film is to show up when the odds are against the hero's like when playing the old arcade game ""Streets of Rage"" and you could use a power move to destroy all enemies in one go. The editing and cut shots are jumpy and incoherent making some scenes awkward to watch, dialog is laughable and story is predictable, if you looking at picking some of the flaws in the film. However this isn't to be taken serious, it's a film made to make money and keep people entertained, which it does do and does well.<br/><br/>Watch this if you liked: Cobra, Commando, Universal Solider or Transporter.<br/><br/>Verdict: Sit back, relax and enjoy a feast for the eye's and then exercise your brain after with a crossword or any other puzzle."

All they needed was some creative writing, something that would have shown unequivocally why these old timers are legends and better than the tens of drones that get shot down in the film.<br/><br/>Alas, no such writing was in store for them. People just died from their bullets and missed all shots, the villain was called Villain, the girl was there just for the fun of it and the reason why they all did what they did felt completely artificial. I really, really, wanted to enjoy the film as much as I did the trailer. It was not to be.<br/><br/>Bottom line: this film only emphasised that these actors are really old. They move around arthritically shooting bullets because they can't do much else. The plot only enhances the feeling.

"blackmamba99971","8","0","0","26 November 2012"," A nice follow up
","Well let's see, first it was a good plot to see Jean Claude Van Damme as the bad guy. A man who runs a group called the sangs that are looking for low grade plutonium to sell to the highest bidder. Yet to do that he would need a special computer box that has a blueprint of the plutonium's location. Thus the expendables are called in to stop him at all costs. But during their little trek to find the box, are ambushed and Billy (Liam Hemsworth) a pure and razor sharp sniper is kidnapped and used as a ransom to get the box. However, when the exchange is made, Jean Claude kills him in the end. This causes barney (Stallone) to exact revenge upon jean and his cohorts for killing his best asset. In the middle is a new team member, although temporary to replace Yin (Jet Li) so that they can find the box, and the mine for which the plutonium is stored after the cold war. I thought it was a good film, not as good as the first mind you with an extra as Chuck Norris to fill in the gaps as well as Bruce Willis, and Arnold Shwarzenegger it gave the move too many clich√©s to be desired. Like Ill be back, or some other type of movie redundant statement. Other than that, the action was good, I liked the music which fits their persona to a 'T' using old rock tunes for aged mercenaries. Dolph Lundgren was also a good addition as the psycho mercenary who plays with bombs. However, in his past he was a chemist graduate with full honours. Hm who knew. Still it was a good film, great shooting action, and explosions that you would expect from Simon West. All in all, above average with some quirky clich√©s that needed to be left out. If the movie was to be a pure mercenary picture, using old single one liners was not a good idea. Recommended to ages above 17. Great for action fans of this calibre."

"sylvanian","5","0","0","23 November 2012"," Chain of fighting scenes with little else
","An amazingly empty movie. A primitive and naive plot seems to be created with one goal - to chain a number of fighting and shooting scenes. The scenes are realistic in the sense of blood and gore, but completely unrealistic in the number of bad guys easily shot with no wounds for the protagonists. The rest is rather a a not-so-logical action it in a hard-to-believe context.<br/><br/>The lack of belief is in everything from the main line to details. Take for the start the escape of the team in the starting scene where they rappel along the electric wire easily passing many poles on the way as if they go along a cable line. Or their complete unprofessional behavior when they fall in a trap... Or loads of plutonium in a mine in Albania. The creators did little to make everything at least a little believable like good action movies do.<br/><br/>In its bare-action approach, it reminds me some old Chuck Norris movies.. well and Chuck Norris is, of course, in the movie too. And this is the only thing in this film that justifies watching - all macho heroes or Hollywood, together in one movie, cracking jokes and their usual phrases like I will be back. This turns some part of the movie into a parody and make it bearable. Having it all more like a parody would be a winning move, but most of the movie is to serious and doesn't look like a parody, so it doesn't work."

That alone deserves five points compared to other action movies that spend 100 million dollars and shoot the fights with hand-held.

Shame on you, Sly.<br/><br/>And shame on you Jet for literally bailin' out of the plane and the movie so early. I was sure that you'd rescue everyone in the cave in. But NO. You left it to Arnold.<br/><br/>I think I know the answer to this question, but does any character ever suffer from PTSD?<br/><br/>Now come on. I think everyone knows that Stallone could never really beat Van Damme on Jean Claude's worst day and Sly's best.<br/><br/>And I think you'd better ramp-up the production of E3 very fast.

","I was expecting a pretty decent movie, what with all the action stars in this movie. I enjoyed the first one, so I admit, maybe I held my hopes a little too high. This movie was definitely not what I was hoping for in an action movie. It consisted of expert marksmen bad guys missing every shot, a fatal flaw in many hopeful movies that turn out to be busts. It was just too unrealistic. I get it, you don't want your stars to get shot, but come on! Really?! Only one of them got shot throughout the whole movie and wasn't even badly injured. And if course, what would a failed action movie be without all,of toe good guys shouting out unnecessary, melodramatic, run of the mill battle cries. Okay, your trying to be funny, but after the twentieth time, it gets kind of old, don't you think? I mean, one of the goo guys dies in the first thirty minutes?! Come on! And hen you have a gun, and the bad guy doesn't, and he tries to taunt you into hand to hand combat, just don't. Shoot him on the spot. Actually, the only good thing in this movie was the hand to hand combat. That and Chuck Norris and Arnold Schwarzenegger's banter. At least that was not overdone. This is one of those movies where you already know the story because it has been done so many times. It's tired and worn out, Sylvester is trying to hard to be that young action star he once was with all that eager wit, but sadly, he doesn't measure up. It was almost as of this movie couldn't figure out if it was going to be a gory comedy or a serious action flick. Also the romantic side of Sylvester just did jot do. it was not working out.I can see how some might like it, and I suggest you watch it to generate your own opinion. This is just my opinion and mine alone. It had some great potential and room to work with, but it just wasn't enough. The story line lagged. Also, the ending when the girlfriend gets the letter. She was not nearly emotional enough. Your boyfriend died. Cry a little!!!"

","Barney Ross, Toll Road, Hale Caesar, Gunner, Lee Christmas, Yin Yang and of course TRENCH are back for another round of explosively awesome, over-the-top entertainment you just have to love. This time around, The Expendables are sent into Eastern Europe to get information leading to tons of Cold War-era plutonium. The last thing they want is for this to get into the wrong hands. Towards that end, they recruit a young new Expendable, Billy the Kid (Hemsworth), a youthful veteran of the war in Afghanistan. As if the team wasn't powerful enough, when Church (Willis) assigned this mission to them, he also sent along the highly competent Maggie (Nan). But things get complicated when they run into super-evil baddie Villain (JCVD) and his equally nefarious sidekick Hector (Adkins). These two jerks are forcing an entire town to work in their plutonium mines. Without giving away any spoilers, let's just say something happens that causes The Expendables to want REVENGE! And these are some dudes (and Maggie) that you DO NOT want on your bad side. Expendables away! We were overjoyed to see the triumphant return of The Expendables. Thankfully, it was done right, which is rare for a sequel - but perhaps this isn't any ordinary sequel. The writers stuck to the formulas that worked from the first film - what we would call ""vehicles and oldies"" (i.e. motorcycles, planes, trucks, etc. and songs such as Rare Earth's ""I Just Want To Celebrate"" and The Rascals' ""It's A Beautiful Morning"", among others) - but they smartly didn't just rest there and they made new improvements such as a young Expendable and a female Expendable. Plus, to the delight of the audience, everything is just BIGGER. Bigger guns, bigger explosions, bigger action setpieces, and a massive body count. Plus we get more Trench and Church than ever before. So it would be like a master pastry chef making one of his classic cakes, but adding more frosting. You can't hope for better in a sequel.<br/><br/>While most missions into hostile territory shun violence unless it is absolutely necessary, what's so great about The Expendables is that they execute their missions with the maximum amount of violence. Just look at the opening raid (which both films have - but this new one is better. For example, their truck says ""Bad Attitude"" and ""Shock and Awe"" on it. So there). But this amount of ultra-violence would be a lot tougher to take if the film didn't have a healthy dose of humor. We said everything is bigger this time, and that includes the laughs. There are a lot of truly funny moments, and the men involved even mock themselves at certain points. It looked like everyone involved was having fun, and that sense is extremely infectious and winning. Van Damme surely relished being the baddie, which he rarely portrays. He was perfectly cast as the arrogant Eurotrash guy. And seeing Stallone and JCVD fight - on the big screen no less - was a treat. Most action movies have one good one-liner, if you're lucky. The Expendables 2 is chock full of them. And Stallone continues his streak of giving his characters great names - the ""kid"" in the movie is ""Billy the Kid"" and again without subtlety, the villain is named Villain. As far as Nan Yu's character, Maggie, we think Stallone might have gotten her confused with Maggie Q. Or possibly Maggie Cheung.<br/><br/>Of course, the whole thing is a complete adolescent male fantasy blown up on the big screen. But that's the genius of The Expendables. It taps into the male brain in an extremely effective way. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. As an added bonus, the take-away message of the movie is that ""Violence DOES solve problems"". Which happens to be true, but is considered politically incorrect in today's wimpy climate. So the movie has guts, brains and heart, and has plenty of ""YES!"" moments to boot. And the fact that The Expendables are getting REVENGE just sweetens the deal even more. Now that we've given the movie its due props, we have to mention two minor quibbles. The usage of CGI during some of the bullet hits makes it look like a video game at times, and some of the in-jokey humor goes too close to the irony edge for our liking. But it's all in good fun, and, taken as a whole, those small grievances pale into nothing. If the movie didn't deliver, those complaints would have more merit, but it does deliver, so, we're more than willing to let them go.<br/><br/>It pretty much goes without saying at this point, but we LOVED The Expendables 2. We applaud everyone involved for doing 99% of everything right, and unquestionably delivering the goods that fans want. It's a proud moment for the cast, for the crew, and for America.

Moreover, it is amazing how fit the even 60+ years old men are chasing-shooting-fighting much better than their counterparts in their 30ies. And vulgar cursing has been brought to a minimum letting the movie to be enjoyed by a ""decent"" audience as well.

"tomgillespie2002","5","0","0","8 November 2012"," No more than an amusing way to kill 90 minutes
","Since 2006's Rocky Balboa, Sylvester Stallone has been on a nostalgia trip, re-visiting the characters and genres that catapulted him to the A-list in the 1980's and early 90's. After his rather average yet commercially successful homage to cheesy action - 2010's The Expendables - Stallone and his crew are back, with some extra recruits and some familiar (and aged) faces from the genre. Thankfully, Stallone has passed the director's chair to Simon West, a director who has plenty of experience in blowing s**t up with the ridiculous yet irresistibly enjoyable Con Air (1997). If there was a main problem with the first film, it was that Stallone's action scenes were messy and confusing, hardly akin the kung-fu-inspired action of the 1980's.<br/><br/>After returning from a successful mission in Nepal, new recruit Bill (Liam Hemsworth) announces his retirement at the end of the month. Shady CIA operative Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) forces group leader Barney (Stallone) into taking a mission to recover a mysterious item in a crashed plane located in Albania. The group, including Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), Toll Road (Randy Couture), Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), and newly appointed technical expert Maggie Chan (Yu Nan), are ambushed by international criminal Claude Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme) who kills Bill and flees with the retrieved item. Gradually the team uncover a plot to find a storage of plutonium left over from the Cold War, and the enslavement of a nearby town by Villain.<br/><br/>Early rumours that Stallone was going for a milder tone to allow a younger audience to see and enjoy the film are quickly dashed with an opening scene full of exploding heads and CGI blood. Stallone loves his blood and explosions - that was clear from 2008's almost pornographically gory Rambo. His goal was to aim higher and bigger with the sequel, and while on a whole it is pretty much on par with the first, the scope is certainly larger and the giddy in-jokes are more outlandish and obvious. The film is certainly full of love for the genre that was so good to Stallone, and what person that grew up in the 1980's and 90's would not smile at the sight of Planet Hollywood's Stallone, Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger mowing down bad guys side-by-side?<br/><br/>Yet it is at times so ridiculous and self-consciously cheesy that it comes across as a parody of itself. Schwarzenegger and Willis steal each other's catch phrases (""I'll be back!""/""Yippee-kay-ya"") and Stallone even cracks a Chuck Norris Facts joke, and while these are funny, it takes the edge off the action and creates a feeling that none of these characters are really going to be in any real trouble. While Mickey Rourke sadly departed the project and Jet Li only briefly appearing, the addition of Chuck Norris and an actually very impressive Van Damme certainly compensate (the latter adding to his surprisingly moving performance in JCVD (2008)). But the film is crammed with far too many characters that pushes the whole Expendables crew minus Stallone well into the background. It won't stop me watching the upcoming third instalment, but this is no more than an amusing way to kill 90 minutes - much like the films it's playing homage to.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"ani-for-prez","5","0","0","8 November 2012"," Some may enjoy though I sure didn't!
","I have absolutely nothing against any amount of gratuitous violence, swearing or sex in the movies I watch. I'm not one of those prudes or cultured snobs who proclaims that movies that feature buckets of blood are not acceptable and are a blot on the art. No, I enjoy that which is art, and that which is most assuredly entertainment. I enjoyed the last Expendables as such a piece of entertainment and it was fun. Watching a movie about the propagation of the American dream with bundles of ammo flung at foreigners tickled the neurons in my brain that enjoy such a movie that decidedly does not take itself seriously. But here's the thing. The sequel SUCKED for me.<br/><br/>It obviously wasn't the violence as I have already stated. And it definitely wasn't the playfully xenophobic and misogynistic tone of the movie. Those were expected as the target audience is a bunch of testosterone fuelled males looking for some blood-spurtin' action. It was the fact that it really wasn't done that well.<br/><br/>Firstly, what everyone's talking about; the cameos by the immortal Chuck Norris, the Guvernator Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Jean Claude Van Damme. Many people here are raving about how awesome Chuck Norris and Arnie are in this movie. Really? All I saw was how the director decided to put the badasses of the 80s and put them in their clich√©d roles they embodied at their prime, which though sounds amazing in paper, was done incredibly badly. If it was used to good effect, it would have been a great part of the movie. Instead we get one-liners and other done-to-death jokes pushed into the movie just for the sake of being humorous. The punchlines were jammed and slammed into the dialogue and brought up at awkward places where they don't really work. Other movies have done this before and the way it worked for them was they did it SUBTLY. It makes it far more enjoyable than getting it hurled at you.<br/><br/>Secondly, I'm sure I'm not the only guy who noticed that these dudes are OLD. This was aptly pointed out at the end by Arnie's little joke but it was not a pretty sight to see. The first movie didn't make me feel this too bad but this time I can see the tons of effort put into making Stallone a little younger. I can see Van Damme's wrinkled skin and pouchy eyes. Schwarzenegger looks almost pitiful here and I felt a little sorry for him. Only Bruce Willis actually pulled off the fresh and ready look. I didn't enjoy looking at their aged faces trying their best to pull this off and I felt a bit embarrassed.<br/><br/>Finally, the plot in this movie was crap. I didn't expect a Dark Knight or a Black Swan or anything really. But when they tried to pull of a death and revenge plot line, I felt they did it really badly. To be able to do a successful death scene, there needs to be enough character developed for us to care when they die. That simply can't happen when you're gleefully mowing down scores of villains with no regrets. This movie tried to be more than that and it fails.<br/><br/>What it does good is be a throwback to the 80s. The stereotypical villain, named Jean Villain in a fit of awesomeness, even sports a Satan tattoo. He does bad, bad things, has a much more skilled sidekick who is killed by the hero's worthy sidekick as the hero himself sets out to vanquish him. The formula offers some hilarity, some nostalgia and much fun through its shortcomings. The villains miss every shot when the Americans rarely ever miss, corporations and their evil abounds and epic shootouts and fights happen all the time.<br/><br/>Personally, I didn't enjoy the movie much. Hence the sorta low rating. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't recommend to fans of such movies. If you think you will go ahead, then do so by all means. I hope you enjoy it more than I did."

Don't remember any movie recently that left me in such a good mood.<br/><br/>The film is all I would expect from a run'n'shoot action genre. And yes, there is an exact line between good and bad like in the the old fairy tales.<br/><br/>The dialogues are funny and the actors are not afraid to make fun of themselves and their previous roles. In a way, they actually play a parody to themselves. This is most unusual and refreshing and extend the characters behind the plot of the film. In addition, the film did surprised me pleasantly a few times (not with the plot) and that does not happen that often anymore.<br/><br/>There are references to older films, public life /gossip and even jokes. Back than, when Rambo and Commando came out, Stallone and Schwarzenegger wasn't really a couple in love and many of the phrases would be a clich√© if they would be said by somebody else. Lucky for us - they are not.<br/><br/>The plot in this genre is not very complicated. If you expect a Sherlock Holmes or Da Vinci Code movie, don't watch it. The plot was clear long before they even decided to make it. If this disappoints you, than this genre is probably not your cap of tea.<br/><br/>The atmosphere starts immediately and gets graduated. But if you lucky, you should find a 30 second window between actions, long enough to get you another beer from the fridge.<br/><br/>If you want some action and fun this is a yes. And if you remember the 80', you will have more fun than action and the film is full of action."

","Seeing how there have been over 300 review of this film on here to date, I won't make this review a long one. This masterpiece is simply GREAT. The beginning and end are loaded with incredibly gratuitous action, with a notable amount mixed in. The humor is terrific. The best thing about this film, however, are the direct homages. <br/><br/>Bruce Willis was just like Mcclaine, Arnold like the Terminator, and Van Damme like the pure badass he once was. They all get a rebirth in this KING of all action movies. None of those, however, match up with the pure glee all action fans got from the Chuck Norris moments. From his entrance scene, to the Norris joke references, and all the moments he got to unleash hell. This is what we were expecting from the 1st film(which was also terrific), but it's great that we get it now. I could add more, but this is good enough. <br/><br/>While there will never be an action film that consists of as much epicness overall, I sure hope there's more coming, because these movies are better than any of the other rehashed superhero junk Hollywood is spewing out .

","Right, the first ""The Expendables"" movie was really an action-packed treat for all of us who were young and grew up with these iconic action stars in the 80's and 90's. But strap yourself in for a second ride; a ride that surpassed the first one by a mile and a half.<br/><br/>The storyline in ""The Expendables 2"" is deeper and more thoroughly thought through than the storyline in the first movie. And the villain in this sequel was also more believable and better cast compared to the first one. It was kind of hard to take Eric Roberts seriously in the first movie, so they really upped the stakes in part two and casting Jean Claude Van Damme as the villain, which was a really nice touch to the movie.<br/><br/>But the storyline is of course, as to be expected, spiced up with action, adrenaline and testosterone from beginning to end. And boy does it deliver. The action sequences were nice to look at and were nicely executed. Especially the fight scene between Barney Ross (played by Sylvester Stallone) and the villain (played by Jean Claude Van Damme). That alone was well worth sitting through the movie for.<br/><br/>Again, as in the first movie, they put together a great list of action stars for this sequel. It was a shame that Jet Li wasn't in all of the movie, but hopefully he will be back for the third movie. A new member was added to the team, Maggie Chan (played by Nan Yu) and she actually did a great job as the only woman on this all-male-testosterone force.<br/><br/>And the various characters were given enough time on the screen as to not just become a background member of the group. Each contributed with something to the team and the movie. And I enjoy watching how they each use different combat techniques and weaponry. Personally, my favorite is Lee Christmas (played by Jason Statham), as he has just enough witty sarcasm and makes good use of blades to be quite interesting.<br/><br/>If you enjoy action movies, then you definitely have to sit down and watch ""The Expendables 2"". And if you enjoyed the first movie, do not cheat yourself out of the sequel, because it is just that much better! The movie isn't all seriousness though. It could be debated whether or not the attempts at comedy and jabbing at the individual action stars catch phrases from other movies is good or not. Personally, I found it to be fun and gave the movie just enough comedy and self-irony to make it that much more fun. But on the other hand, I could understand how some people would find these 'comedy jabs' somewhat silly or inappropriate. But lighten up, this is entertainment. Just disconnect your brain and sit back for one amazing action-packed ride.<br/><br/>Lock and load, because this is a ride well worth sitting through."

","Um, right. Pretty much non-stop action, violence, shooting, explosions, chases, blood, guts, fights, rampant mayhem and a script drenched in more corn and cheese than you could shake a battery farm full of egg laying chickens dipped in Edam at. Most of the Expendables could be more aptly termed the Expandables, and they certainly show their age in front of the unflinching eye of the camera lens ‚Äì which quite brutally exposes more plastic work, face and eye lifts than a Joan Rivers lookalike convention. Statham looks the most normal and less of a bloated cartoon caricature out of the older contingent, but then he's younger than they are. A mere pup.<br/><br/>It thinks it's funnier and cleverer than it is and it thinks it's a lot more fun to watch than it is. There's something a bit sad about it all, probably because it fails to acknowledge that these guys ain't the young buck action heroes they once were and treats them as if they were still at the top of their game. If the comedy and satire focused on their advanced ages maybe it would be a touch more endearing. But it doesn't really and it isn't.<br/><br/>The jokes and quips are a bit flat and come over as if they were just made up as the shoot rolled along. The script sounds random and improvised, so it's not exactly a tightly wound machine. There's no way that a cast list like this is not going to be of interest, but the idea of it is a lot better than the actual experience and execution.<br/><br/>If thick-eared self-aggrandising action fantasy semi-parody is your bag, and you like seeing a bunch of pensioners all getting together to kick ass, it will appeal. Just don't expect too much other than a moderately engaging action movie time-filler trading heavily on the past glories of some of its cast. Not essential viewing, more expendable fun, if you will."

Too much story I thought and I think they should have had each player only use lines from previous movies. But they can always do that in number three. I hope they bring Mad Max and Snake Plisken in for that one!"

","Never thought the series was an expandable one, but well, Expendables 2 is a far better movie than its predecessor. With some extreme but good action - was a bit over the top in the first movie, some very good comic liners, and then the screen magic with an ensemble cast - not to mention the electrifying vibe when one gets to see the oldies together - the movie is definitely a thrilling outing, and to the ones who grew up watching Stallone, Bruce and Arnold, this might serve to be nostalgic too. This time we have another oldie as villain, Gosh!! missed VanDamme and his kicks. Statham so funky, crude and witty with his oneliners as usual. Nothing thought provoking with the plot, in fact its just cooked up to bring together the characters. With a not so loud music and some decent action choreography, the movie finally ends up satisfying the masses. Definitely worth watching for the Oldie's fans. :)))"

","Expendables 2 was a decent follow up to its predecessor where bunch of popular tough guys from early 80's and 90's collaborate and gives you gun-throttling action popcorn masala entertainment. The sequel starts from where it was left in the first part when Mr.Church goes on a mission leading Expendables to discover a map to a plutonium location somewhere down in Russia. However , the mission goes topsy-turvy when one of his fellow mate is murdered by cruel Villain played by Van Damme. Expendables must go out and seek revenge for their members and save plutonium from falling into wrong hand. Directed by Simon West ( Con-Air) , Expendables 2 promises to have more impact then its predecessor but falls flat on the face. It is just an average flick with old wine in a new bottle. If you have been a great fan of Stallone , Schwarzenegger , Van-Damme , Statham then you might enjoy the film otherwise the screenplay has nothing new to offer. Even the actions scenes are seen-similar kind with nothing new to offer. Simon West has not been in form this time. He could have made it more entertaining with punching dialogues ... good action sequences ... good story line !! Unfortunately , it is just a time-pass. It is Stallone and team which makes this otherwise seen-before movie watchable.<br/><br/>Overall , if you have liked 90's action stars , this movie is meant for you otherwise stay away from it !!!"

","After a successful rescue mission of a Chinese millionaire in Nepal, CIA Church (Bruce Willis) meets Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and asks him to travel with his team to Albania to retrieve the content of a safe in a plane that has crashed. Church sends the specialist Maggie (Nan Yu) to go with them. Soon they find the plane and Maggie takes a box from the safe, but while returning to the plane, they find that their sniper Billy The Kid (Liam Hemsworth) has been captured by a group of men under the command of Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme). He asks them to put the weapons on the ground and deliver him the box; otherwise he would kill the hostage. Barney and his group do exactly what was ordered but Villain kills Billy the Kid before leaving in a helicopter. Barney asks Maggie what was inside the box and she tells that it shows the locations of a large mine of Russian plutonium. Now Barney and his men decide to track down Villain and his group known as The Sangs and kill them.<br/><br/>""The Expendables 2"" is a cartoonist, silly and funny action movie with dream cast of the genre. There are great jokes and my favorite is the one about the master's degree of Dolph Lundgren. If the viewer shutdowns his brain, he will certainly enjoy this movie despite the inconsistencies such as the cold-blood killers Villain and The Sangs sparing the dangerous Barney and his team instead of killing them. My vote is six.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Os Mercen√°rios 2"" (""The Mercenaries 2"")"
"Matt1567","8","4","12","18 August 2012"," What a cast! It should have been the first ""Expendables""
","I'll tell you what I did not think highly of the first Expendables film and I can even tell you why¬ÖI thought it was rushed and thrown together (cluttered). I thought Arnold Schwarzenegger's role in the movie was not even needed at all and he was only in it because he was a big name. Part of the problem was he could only film for one day in the first film because he was still Governor of California and could only film on a weekend without the people of California becoming mad at him. It was also apparent Bruce Willis's part was far too short as well but at least his role was needed. I thought the biggest disaster of ""The Expendables"" was how Mickey Rourke's character was used it seemed like he had a story around the main plot of the story and it didn't seem like he was needed either (certainly not as much as he was used anyway). Rourke did not have one action scene and it was almost always boring every time he was on screen. There was almost no action in the first Expendables until the end of the film and the editing was atrocious. Sylvester Stallone might want stick to acting and not go into directing in the future (unless he can give full attention to directing a film and not act in it like a Clint Eastwood). That being said, the Willis, Stallone, Schwarzenegger scene in the first film was awesome. In Expendables 2 critics might give Simon West a hard time here but you know what as far as I am concerned he did a decent, no, actually a damn good job. There was an actual pace to this film (something the first one was lacking) and you know what it was clearly because of West. I have to tell you as far as I'm concerned Expendables 2 was a blast! It is not going to win an Oscar and it sure as hell is not a masterpiece or even a great serious movie but it is also not trying to be. I can tell you one thing it was a wicked good time. Just sit back and don't think too much just enjoy it. I mean do you think Predator, Die Hard, or Universal Soldier would ever win an academy award? All of my favorite action stars from the 80's, 90's and today all starred in an action film together and all were used properly to make it work. There were scenes that were funny, scenes with great action, and everyone was needed in the main plot of the story. The film is not in the same category as Rocky, Universal Soldier, Predator, Terminator, or even Die Hard but more like a True Lies, Nowhere To Run, Rambo category. None the less the movie is what the first Expendables should have been, it is not rushed, had a crap load of action, and was well edited (thank you West and editing team). I can also say Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Bruce Willis, Chuck Norris, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, and the great Arnold Schwarzenegger were all in the film from beginning to end this time around and that really made the movie kick ass. I'd say it put the ""Expendables 2"" a tiny notch above that True Lies, Nowhere To Run, Rambo category just because of the adrenaline pumping cast! The script could have been better (although it was better than the first one), but who cares? It was a fun time. As far as acting goes I would say Stallone was impressive he did not break character and you really felt his connection with Liam Hemsworth (granted some of Hemsworth's dialogue could have been shortened during the plane scene). It was great to see Arnold Schwarzenegger back in an action film in a major role. Chuck Norris probably had some of the best lines as well as laughs in the movie. Jean-Claude Van Damme was also very impressive as the villain. I actually thought he could have been used more every time he was on screen he was in perfect character (evil and a bit crazy too). The ""Expendables 2"" flowed and turned out to be one hell of a ride! I'd say 7/10 for action fans, and 8/10 for the cast. Bring on Expendables 3 and let's turn that cast rating into a 10 out of 10."
"hasan_renkal_62","6","3","8","31 August 2012"," Track em, find em, kill em!
","The Expendables 2 is better then the first one of course. The first one was very good but this one is much better. In this one, The Expendables goes to a mission but when they find Billy the Kid who has been caught by Villain and later get killed, their next mission is to ""Find em, track em, kill em"". The team goes to find them with the help of Maggie, the team must now seek for revenge for what they have did. Barney also meets up with Trench and Church which they are going to help, the team also meet up with Booker who was an Expendable as well. He is mostly doing solo now. The team must now kill Villain and rescue citizens in an poor city where most of them works with Villain. <br/><br/>This movie is the best movie i have sawed this year, its really awesome to see Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Willis team up and i love when they make references of Rambo, Terminator and Die Hard. I like that i get a little feeling that feels like John Rambo, Terminator and John McClane are team working but they are but with another characters instead. We have Jason Statham, Dolp Lundgren, Randy Couture and Terry Crews back, Jet Li appears in the film but only in the beginning because he took home a man back to his home in China so Yin Yang stayed there. Chuck Norris makes an awesome appearance as Booker which the name comes from a early movie of Norris. Bad thing is that Tool who is played by Mickey Rourke doesn't appear in this movie but we still got Lundgren which except Stallone is the best Expendable. For me, Stallone and Lundgren deserves an Academy Award for their awesome performance, its also good to see Liam Hemswhorth which gets killed by Villain which is played by Jean- Claude Van Damme which is bad-ass.<br/><br/>Anyway, The Expendables 2 is a really funny movie and the Gunnar, Hale, Toll Road, Trench and Mr. Church has a better role here then they had in the last one. This is one of the best Stallone movies ever and it was kick-ass and bad-ass. <br/><br/>10/10 Stallone and the rest of the Action gangs knows how to be bad-ass!"

","Originally planning to meet up with a friend later in the day,I was surprise when I suddenly got a phone call from them asking if I would like to come along to a ""preview"" screening of The Expendables 2!.Since finding the first movie to be a fun Action ride,and also having been left breathless from a number of the casts fantastic films over the years,I decided to come along and witness the second reunion of the Action legends.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Enjoying a few well dissevered beers to celebrate helping a Chinese billionaire and an old friend called Trench escape from a high security prison camp,the Expenables also do a toast to ""Bill The Kid"",who despite being a proud member of the gang thanks to his amazing sniper skills,has decided that the work that the Expendables have to do is something which he cant fully put his heart into.Interupting the on going celebration's, CIA agent ""Church"" tells the Expendables that due to them all owing him a huge favour,he has decided to give them a mission of stopping a rouge group of mercenaries led by Jean-Villain from making a bomb with petroleum that Russia had left to gather dust in mines at the end of the Cold War.Following Church's orders,the Expendables quickly come face to face with Villain,but are caught off guard when Jean's mercenaries show themselves and force the gang to get on their hands and knees,and sit face down on the ground.As his helicopter starts to get set for his getaway drive,/Villain decides to strike right at the very heart of the Expendables,by getting hold of Billy and ruthlessly killing him right in front of their faces.Seeing the helicopter disappear into the distance,the Expendables vow that along with stopping Jean from carrying out his insane plan,they are going to do everything to avenge the death of their fallen brother in arms Billy. <br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Correcting the mistake he had made with turning down the offer to appear in the first film,Jean-Claude Van Damme fully takes the second opportunity which he has thankfully been given by making Jean Villain a wonderful,ice-cool characters,who along with delivering super-kick hitting action scenes (such as a tense final fight with Sylvester Stallone) also shows moments of Villain calculating the perfect moment to strike at the gang when they are at their weakest.Whist the movies plot is rather straight forward,screenwriters Stallone,Richard Wenk ,David Agosto and Ken Kaufman make the excellent ensembles camaraderie a true joy to witness,as Stallone,Jason Statham,Chuck ""Facts"" Norris and ""The Governator"" hit each other with as many smile-inducting one liners as they do hard punches.Giving the movie an explosive opening which could cause some small islands to sink underwater,director Simon West keeps the films tremendous pace lean and sharp,with the editing of the action scenes, ( which includes a huge airport shoot-em-up party) never becoming to dizzy,but instead smartly allowing the action to be fully observed,whilst also using the ""character beats"" to give a real sense of the loss that the Expendables are determined to avenge."
"leckeith","6","3","9","20 August 2012"," Over done
","I absolutely love Sly Stallone and the cast is great too, when the Expendables came out it was one of the few movies I had ever watched back to back. With much regret I must confess I do not feel the same way about this new installment. I will be the first to admit, there are some pretty great scenes throughout the movie, some great one liners and cool fights, but the main problem I had with this movie was that it did not take itself seriously like the first one. I get that most people feel this breed of movie is cheesy, which is fine, but the movie itself can't admit it or you get a piece of crap movie like Shoot'Em Up. E2 was over the top from the get go, with every actual cool scene over washed with ""try hard"" one liners. That being said I could definitely find the good amongst all the bad and just pray the third one does not go in the same direction. I say this with love in my heart for the actors involved and the potential of the series."
"doomas10","6","3","9","16 August 2012"," They are back - this time they bring noise!
","So here comes the masterpiece that ""Expendables 2"" is. Not really no. Far from masterpiece. But the thing is, it is an absolute blast from start to finish literally. The first chapter wasn't that bad at all but the excessive amounts of CGI bood, the terrible special effects and the quick/cut fight scenes betrayed the purpose of the film. Instead of being a massive throwback to the 80's clich√©d and unbelievable flawed action flicks, it felt a mis-mash of seriousness - first half - and goofy fun -parodic action sequences in the second half. ""Expendables 2"" does not repeat the same mistakes. Simon West who knows two or three things about action (""Con air""), relies and mostly succeeds in delivering high octane action blasts. Every possible gun is on screen and on use. Vehicles such as tanks, choppers, bikes, trucks, aeroplanes and jeeps are blown up into tiny little pieces in glorious fashion through massive and loud set pieces. The film is rated 15 here in UK so you get to see bloody shootouts that may remind you some of the chaotic sequences in ...wait for it...""Hard Boiled"" (not choreographed though). <br/><br/>What makes E2 that much fun is the unique combination between all these (mostly) old and new stars. Sylvester Stallone still has it and it is remarkable that he doesn't try to focus too much on his character or to a potential love interest (Yu Nan - more on her later) because that would look ridiculous. The rest of the cast are great, particularly Dolf Lungren who kinda steals the show with one liners and weird facial expressions. However, the biggest sensation....comes from Jean Claude Van Damme as the psychotic Jean Villain!?. Not only the actor is having a blast as the primary villain, he is actually sensational. Every time he is on screen, he actually acts more like Villain and not as Van Damme. His presence is kinda magnetic and his physical mannerisms very interesting. I cant believe i am saying this. Sure he is not going to get any awards for that performance, but it is a) a nice change, b) good to see him on the big screen again and c) actually a pretty decent villain. Van Damme FTW! Willis and Arnie have more to do this time and it is really cool to see three of the biggest action stars of all time to kick some serious amounts of ass by blowing up buildings, destroying walls or ... by driving Smarts!<br/><br/>Biggest disappointment comes from Jet Li though! He is merely in the film for 10 minutes and then he is gone (that's no spoiler btw). In the first film, most complaints aimed at Jet Li's character who didn't have a particular scene to shine. Here West understood this and gives him a whole new sequence with frying pans to do something. His exit from the team early makes room for Yu Nan's Chinese agent who is simply to put it terrible. Never convincing for a special agent, her line delivery is astonishingly bad, her relationship with Barney awkward and frankly i did not care for her. She is out of place and looks confused all the time. The filmmakers should have tried to get Michelle Yeoh for that part!<br/><br/>The fight sequences are better this time around (highlight the airport shootout), the action bigger and better and the actors seem to have more fun. Quieter scenes when these characters are talking and interacting to each other with jokes and philosophical talks are always a plus in an overloaded action film as we actually tend to like them and they do not come cheesy. E2 is not a terrible film but neither a very good one. In fact it is not even a good one. But it is a decent effort against to all those boring CGI infested action films of the last couple of years with a great cast and some AWE-inspiring set pieces. And any film that makes Van Damme cool again, is considered awesome."

The great and funny cast is back to offer one and half hour of simple entertainment to anyone who appreciates the genre and not looking for a tedious or corny message.

","Grotesque metaphors involving Asian women and pornography, incomprehensible choreography of fight scenes, boring rehashes of a million clich√©s, this movie just doesn't excel in any way. It was boring, it was B movie quality most of the time and it felt like most of the people involved weren't all that interested in being involved. The one actor that I thought put a little extra into his performance was Jean Claude Van Damme, the fact alone should scare you. Stallone is washed up, Arnold is washed up, Bruce Willis is still OK, but, he clearly doesn't really care and plays this role more cheesy than straight up. It's just a corn ball movie featuring washed up old actors on steroids milking their past even as they're being escorted to the retirement home."

","Why does Hollywood insist on making action movies without the benefit of a decent plot. Why do they keep making characters who act like they have an IQ of a block of wood. You're telling me that a man with the experience Sylvester Stallone's character is supposed to have in this business couldn't see what the entire audience saw coming, that Jean-Claude Van Damme's character was going to kill Liam Hemsworth's character. He is such a complete utter moronic idiot that he can't see what we all could see the minute the scene started. They make all the characters act like a bunch of wimps and totally roll over and do as they're told, but we're supposed to believe they are some of the most dangerous assassins in the world. So follow along with me, they're the smartest most dangerous assassins in the world, but they totally get taken in by one of the most obvious ploys and do nothing to defend themselves, just take it like a bunch of losers, give up the package and let their team mate get killed any way, but we're supposed to root for them. Because idiotic losers who make stupid choices are what we're supposed to root for. They seem to be confused with what an underdog is if that's what they were going for, underdogs are INCREDIBLY GIFTED AND SKILLED but just never catch a break or haven't had the opportunity to prove their worth yet. Incredibly gifted and skilled people would have never fallen for that ridiculously obvious ploy. How are we supposed to recover from thinking what a bunch of inept losers they are and root for them. They should have fired every writer on this staff when they read the first draft. Heroes don't have to be stupid. In fact it's unlikely they'd ever have become the team we're supposed to believe they are if they were ever that stupid. I would like to give the movie much more than a 1 out of 10 based on the action scenes because a lot of them were really quite good. I just can't get past the drivel that's supposed to pass for a script or plot. I miss the days when action heroes were actually written as smart, skilled, intelligent people instead of dim witted meat heads who create situations because of their actions and then get all enraged. How about giving them legitimate reasons to go after someone instead of manufacturing ridiculous ones that make the protagonists look like morons. The plutonium and the destruction it would cause wasn't enough to warrant them going after them, of course not, because that makes sense. We can't have an action hero these days that actually does something sensible. They have to totally screw the situation up then spend the whole movie fixing it, because stupid people always become tops in their field, right?"
"levich122","2","2","5","21 December 2012"," Are you serious?
","It makes me sad that this movie has such a high rating. Do the masses really enjoy action movies that lack good action? Most of the stars in this movie have been in at least one awesome movie if not a whole slew of awesome movies. Most likely the entire budget was spent on their salaries versus putting together a good script and good action. What a terrible waste of an opportunity to make a great action film.<br/><br/>If you want to see a movie with awesome action and an awful script, watch something like The Raid Redemption. I'm totally okay with sacrificing a script for good action, but this doesn't even deliver on that. This is exactly the type of garbage people associate with big ticket Hollywood movies made for those who can't decipher what a proper film is. For those that enjoyed the one liners, for me that just wasn't nearly enough to make this a fun film. I thought the 1st Expendables, while not a great film either, was at least more entertaining than this one. If you are bored, pop this on in the background while you do something else, otherwise I suggest you don't waste your time watching it."
"p-stepien","3","2","5","20 December 2012"," Going for the Guinness record?
","Sly Stallone returns with the biceps-chiselled super soldiers for hire ""The Expendables"" for another adrenaline rush of masculine overdrive. Taking off from where they left has the who-is-who is action movies past and present turning on the ruckus and bringing the bloody noise. The mercenary grouping consists of Sylvester Stallone (as Barney Ross), Jason Statham (as Lee Christmas), Dolph Lundgren (as Gunnar Jensen), Terry Crews (as Hale Caesar), Randy Couture (Toll Road), Liam Hemsworth (as Bill the Kid) and also has a short cameo by Asian kungfu outbreak star Jet Li (Yin Yang). Meanwhile the opposing forces bring fury in the form of the Muscles from Brussels Jean Claude van Damme (as the villain Villain) and Scott Adkins (as Hector). To add to the testosterone we also get treated to extended cameos by Bruce Willis (Church), everyone's favourite governor Arnold Schwarzenegger (Trench) and the invincible Chuck Norris (as Booker). The plot connecting all these personas is entirely secondary, but for those still interested entails some wicked plan of obtaining five tonnes of weapons grade plutonium in order to sell to the highest bidder. Whereas Villain is in the picture for cosmic profit, the Expendables have a more personal plan regarding vengeance after one of their own gets killed.<br/><br/>After a stellar box office entry with the original the follow-up seemed inevitable. Giving back some glory back to the great action icons of the 1980s and 1990s the venture proved a welcome self-referential joyride for all involved - viewers, actors and producers alike. Nonetheless, for me personally the original pretence grew old, out-dated, as the ridiculously brash script leaves little room for character development, instead spending most time in an attempt to break the world record for most on-screen deaths (counting in at what seemed like half a century of corpses) and throwing in references to iconic movies of the past. The action itself grew tiresome as endless droves of minions get wiped out without as much as a scratch on our super-squad, while the jabs at public images of stars involved grow increasingly repetitive (as if just retreading paths already ventured) lacking therefore the witty charm of the first instalment.<br/><br/>Although somewhat entertaining the humour lacks the same novelty, which made the original work so well, whilst not enough focus was offered to a more brainier, less clich√©d story, which would allow for the characters to flesh out and become their own. Conversely the endless carnage offered throughout starts to drag and guest appearances by Arnie or Chuck proved futile in reigniting interest in the movie.<br/><br/>Although Stallone no longer stands at the helm the overall control seems not to have shifted. Nonetheless the more chaotic original seemed to offer a stronger outlet for action than the somewhat cumbersome focus on CGI gore, tank sized plot holes and absolute lack of interest in character development. Further instalments are certain to follow as the franchise seems to gather steam, but the series can only go so far on self-referential sarcasm."

While the Expendables did give us a fun ride, most people thought it could have been better. <br/><br/>The Expendables 2 surpasses the first film in every way possible.

Arnold<br/><br/>Added to the cast are Van Damme, Scott Adkins, Chuck Norris, Liam Hemsworth and Nan Yu. We were also promised much more screen time for Arnold and Bruce. Van Damme plays the bad guy with Scott Adkins as his body guard. He kills one of Barney's(Stallone) men and sets off to get his revenge. While the story is pretty standard, its more then serviceable for the action.<br/><br/>""Whats the Plan?"" Statham ""Track 'em, find 'em, kill 'em."" Stallone<br/><br/>What made this movie so much fun was that it was completely self aware. It knows what fans of the cast want to see. Pure cheese. Arnold and Willis have some truly epic dialog, a lot referencing their older movies. Chuck Norris is not in the movie for to much, but every minute he is on screen, is just so brilliantly done. Any person who watched old Chuck movies will instantly get all the puns and jokes that are said to him.<br/><br/>""You're gonna need more men if you're gonna get through this one."" Chuck ""Can we count on you're help?"" Stallone ""I work better as a Lone Wolf."" Chuck<br/><br/>Van Damme and Scott Adkins make an amazing duo as the bad guys. Van Damme is still in amazing shape and shows off a lot of classic moves he used to do in his old movies such as his world famous spinning back kick. He has a stand-off with Stallone at the end, which is one of the coolest fights in recent memories. Hearing Van Damme smack talk Stallone as he beats up on him, brings back a lot of great memories from his characters in Replicant and Double Impact. <br/><br/>""Im out of bullets!"" Van Damme ""That's your problem!"" Stallone<br/><br/>Van Damme walks out unarmed. ""Do you want to shoot me like a dog? Or fight me like a man?""<br/><br/>Scott Adkins who is most known for his amazing athleticism and fighting style from the Undisputed movies, gets a chance to show off how skilled and quick he is as he has a brutal fight with Jason Statham at the end.<br/><br/>The Expendables 2 was easily the most enjoyable theater experience i've ever had and my favorite movie of 2012.

It's ironic because Expendables II takes place it old Soviet military zones. His role as Jean Villain beckons his former brilliance with great kicks and fighting style. The only thing you wished for in this film was that he kicked more and had some more beat downs showing his dominance in order to achieve what he wants and the way he wants RESPECT! There is a big fight scene at the end, but that is about it. He has his mercenaries do the job most of the time with guns.<br/><br/>The opening scene of the film was excellent, in fact awesome. But there is a gap of action in the middle of the film with meaningless drama. This should of been filled with Van Damme action. They should of created a little more drama in the middle of the film with Church, the girl, and Corporate Conspiracies. The film is too predictable in some ways.<br/><br/>JCVD has noted in some interviews that he thought Sly should of altered the script more than he did for him, but he did not wish to push this matter because he has become Expendable in his acting career and needs the work. But if you see the film JCVD is no way Expendable. Van Damme is In-expendable! He is by far the most exciting asset in the film altogether.<br/><br/>If it was re-done or there's a part III I heard, I think Sly should of stay at the intensity of the opening scene throughout to the end with some sort of climax in the middle. Trickery is good to mix in.<br/><br/>If there is an Expendables III, add Matt Damon into the mix. Maybe he can be the sniper's (Billy) brother. Or add Billy Zane! Rocky Johnson would be interesting. Dennis Rodham or Wesley Snipes also would be interesting all into the mix as bad guys I think. I heard Steven Seagal would like in, but as a good guy. I think the third one should be a little crazier plot, double agents, double crossing, test of the mercenaries wills, loyalty, also the money needs to make more sense. 5 million for a kilo of plutonium or whatever, does not seem like a enough these days to get off the couch. Up the ante, instead of millions, let's have billions at stake. So bigger dogs, leave the cats at home, also add conflicting bad guys, usu. they are fighting for the same bone. If the actors are making more money than the professional mercenaries and bosses that makes no sense. And cash currency is not enough, let's talk gold, intellectual property, secrets, etc."
"Robert_duder","9","2","5","31 August 2012"," Sit down, strap in and get ready for two hours of incredible action.
","One thing is to be understood about The Expendables. Is it a perfect movie? NO. Does it have plot holes? YES. Do you have to shut your brain off nearly completely to let loose and have fun with it? ABSOLUTELY. But once you do that you will find yourself knee deep in the greatest homage to action fans ever. And you will also find the sort of action adult action entertainment that we haven't seen in years. This is the sort of R Rated fodder that made action movies quintessential in the eighties. Expendables 2 is probably even more of all that and is probably closer to the original idea Stallone had for this series. It is more of everything, better everything, non-stop blood guts and explosive action. The nods and outright fourth-wall breaking jokes are just fun and hilarious with direct mention of Rambo, Die Hard, Terminator, and Chuck Norris telling a Chuck Norris joke?!?! Pure awesome. Any red blooded male (or female) who loved action movies in the eighties and of the eighties will just scream with glee over this sequel. The first film laid the ground work and the second just nails it out of the park. That being said I think the first film had a stronger story, and strong actual character development and the sequel just went for pure nostalgia in a lot of ways.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone steps out of the director's chair but stays lead in the cast. I can't help but love this guy and whether its special effects and stunt doubles or not he commands action movies even at almost 70. He looks great and kicks butt like it was 1985. The actual Expendables team sort of took a back seat in this film. They were there but not at the forefront. Jason Statham who is still a very current action star is great with Stallone. They have the perfect ""buddy-cop"" type repertoire and good chemistry with each other. Statham's moment in this movie comes dressed as a priest before seriously cutting through a group of bad guys in hand to hand combat. Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews and Randy Couture all take back seats in this outing. In fact Jet Li leaves the group in the first twenty minutes of the film and never comes back without any real explanation. Lundgren has a lot of MIT jokes in the film (a school he actually attended in real life) but he doesn't get quite as much screen time. Crews and Couture I can't stand anyways...I still don't understand why they're even in this series. Jean-Claude Van Damme is a evil as hell villain and a great adversary for Stallone. His only downfall is that he isn't given enough screen time to really establish a truly outstanding villain. Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger appear again in significantly bigger roles. The absolute highlight of the film is the shootout near the end featuring Willis, Schwarzenegger and Stallone. Seeing these three guys together, in full on action mode is just action hero nirvana. Schwarzenegger's Trench is a one lining killing machine and Willis is as suave and bad-ass as always. The one guy I thought who would ruin the movie was Liam Hemsworth as the new young kid of the group. I firmly eat my shirt because Hemsworth was fantastic and gave Stallone some heart and direction and he did a great job. Nan Yu is the new female addition to the team. She does a good job and they sort of weave in a potential romance with Stallone without forcing down your throat but she definitely holds her own. And finally B-Movie master Scott Adkins (I didn't even realize it was him) plays Van Damme's right hand man. He is okay and certainly cold blooded but he doesn't get a lot of time to establish a character. He gets even less than Steve Austin did in the first one playing the same role.<br/><br/>Wow...what a list a main characters. So mix all of these people up, add in buckets of flying blood, debris, explosions, gunfire, hand to hand combat, knife battles, emotion a good story and you're just riveted to your chair for two hours. I mean this is the sort of nonsensical brain numbing action that you literally cannot get anymore period. And I mean that as the utmost compliment. Director Simon West isn't the type of director who has made dozens and dozens of movies but when I said action movies like Con Air and The Mechanic you know immediately these were first class action flicks. He knows how to tell a story and that indeed matters. Whether this sequel is 10 million behind the original or not...this improves on every single aspect of the first film. This is a rare breed of better sequel. Go see it right now and just let it blow you away. 9/10"
"thefilmdiscussion","7","2","5","29 August 2012"," More blood and jokes, less brooding seriousness make ""2"" way better than the original!
","While the first outing amounted to nothing more than a boring line-up of famous action stars, the sequel is that rare species that is better, far better, than the original. Returning much of the same cast as the original, tossing in a few new names, and nabbing Simon West (Con-Air) to direct are all part of this fun upgrade. Not to mention a script that takes itself far less seriously than the first film, and action scenes that are more thrilling, more intense, better choreographed, and far more bloody and violent. This is the ultimate guy movie. Before you go, let me just list the names who appear in this film. Like the first film, the names alone are enough to get you to drop cash for the ticket, but in The Expendables 2 it's everything else that makes you very glad you did. Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Chuck Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, Liam Hemsworth, and Nan Yu. Is there a plot? Yeah, I guess so, but it's not important. What's important is that they are looking to cast Harrison Ford, Clint Eastwood, Wesley Snipes, John Travolta, and Nicolas Cage in The Expendables 3. Excited yet? -Thomas Bond, TheFilmDiscussion.com"
"ringfire211","8","2","5","29 August 2012"," Much better than the first...
","Not gonna lie - I enjoyed it! I definitely recommend seeing it. But only if you are into cheesy 80s actioners laden with one-liners. That's everyone, right? Hehe...<br/><br/>Anyway, basically everything that was wrong with the first one is right in this one. Simon West's steady hand in the director's chair really captured the action sequences in all their fluid and gory glory as opposed to Sly's choppy and shaky sequences in the first one. Secondly, the action sequences are more creative this time around and not just endless shootings and stabbings. Thirdly, West seems to understand when enough is enough. OK, sure it's overkill here too - not gonna lie. But compared to the first one this looks like a lesson in moderation. Less is more sometimes. And that's always a good thing. The end battle in the first one was just one huge carnage-fest which looked like something out of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN amped up to the 100th degree and felt like it went on for an hour. I couldn't tolerate anymore of it. Here the end battle shows some creativity and tongue-in-cheek fun as each ""hero"" gets to shine and then the 2 final battles are also quick, sweet, and to the point - first between Jason Statham and Scott Adkins and then the grand-finale between Sly and Jean-Claude Van Damme. Great stuff! <br/><br/>But the greatest improvement with this film is that it actually succeeds in doing what it sets out to do - mainly to emulate the glory years of the 80s action picture. The first one failed in this department. It's like the cast didn't get the memo that they weren't doing a Chris Nolan film. Like they forgot that they're supposed to be spoofing 80s actioners. So they bring in Academy-award winner Mickey Rourke to give some sob story about some little girl and some such nonsense. Then the whole team sits around pouting with emo faces. Then the action kicks in and we feel like we're in a Bourne movie - hey why is the camera shaking, dammit??! I thought this was supposed to be good violent fun - a COMMANDO 2010 or something like that. Anyway they definitely rectified this here - no shaky-cam, no emo nonsense, no taking things too seriously. Just old-school fun and mayhem! <br/><br/>The best parts are the guys sitting around and cracking jokes. Gotta love Arnie and Bruce's extended cameos. JCVD is a total revelation as the ""Vilain"" (see what I did there?) - as hissable and vile as possible! Eric Roberts and Steve Austin can go hang their heads in shame. But the highlight has to be Chuck's cameo. Anyone surprised?? Yeah, didn't think so. When Ennio Morricone's TGTBATU score begins to play as Norris emerges from amidst the carnage the theater broke out in applause. I might have even pumped my fist. Can't remember at this stage. Gotta love Chuck not wanting to join the team, saying he's a ""lone wolf"", but he keeps popping up like a ghost from behind corners here and there to lend the team a hand. Then he just disappears again. Love it! Best line of the film? Sly to Chuck: ""I heard you got bitten by a King Cobra"". Chuck to Sly: ""Yeah, I did. But after 5 days of excruciating pain... the Cobra died."" The theater burst into a roar of laughter! Hey, we all knew it was coming.<br/><br/>Do I need to see the film again? Nah, probably not. Did I have a grand old time?? YA BETCHA!! Not much of a story but it sure was fun and the most fun I had at the movies this year. Which isn't really saying much because I've only been to the theater twice thus far. THE GREY was obviously a much better picture but obviously not as much fun. They weren't exactly aiming for ""fun"" with that one.<br/><br/>Still, EX2 was much, much better than the first. I give it a solid 8/10."
"jwidner76","8","2","5","29 August 2012"," ""I'm Back""
","If you're looking for an exciting action movie, look elsewhere. If you are a fan of comic book movies and have fond memories of 80's action flicks, you will be entertained.<br/><br/>I'm glad Norris got his camera time, but I wouldn't be disappointed if he was not in the next one. It would have been nice for Li's character to have more time as his fight scenes are always entertaining. Statham and Van-Damm showed off their skills. Stallone, Willis, and Schwarzenegger were entertaining yet showing their age. I think Couture is doing pretty good crossing over from fighting to acting.<br/><br/>Some of the blood effects were a little over the top for my taste, but other than that I really liked the movie."
"Quinoa1984","6","2","5","25 August 2012"," the guiltiest pleasure? I lost some brain cells...
","The Expendables 2 is loud, violent, messy, and yet, mostly, pretty enjoyable. At its best it embraces its stupid-macho outlook and aesthetic, and if you don't go with it after the first big set-piece (well, let's just say didn't go with it in the first one), then just leave the theater and don't try to come back. It has a premise - men go into a mission to bring a girl to get some map for a mine with plutonium (sadly, no Doc Brown available), and then a villain (no, his name is Jean Villain, which is French for John Villain), and then they have to get back at him when he kills one of the Expendables (a ""Red Shirt"", don't get worried).<br/><br/>Aside from that... who needs plot anyway, stupid f***ers? Let's KILL! And let's have not just walk-ons this time but extended cameos - not just with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis either, but Chuck Norris (ok, ease those erections fan-boys)! And Hey, who needs really firm grasps on how bullets or physics or an airplane crashing through a mountain works, it's an Expendables flick! The movie takes once again off of the mood of 80's/90's B/C/D action movies. Notice I mention C and D. There is such a dearth of intelligence here that if you go in trying to analyze anything, then, again, you're up blank. All that's here with context is male 'we're gonna get im' mentality and, yeah, if you want that, you got it.<br/><br/>For the benefit of the filmmakers, they do a better job engaging with the characters than in the first one, and Simon West, not an 'auteur' with any personality, can manage action scenes and the usual 'shoot fire shoot' cinematography with more competency than Stallone did himself as director with the first movie. The problem, as was (also moreso) with the first movie, is that along with being a 'tribute' to the 80's action fare, it's also the same generic dialog and character relationships. Where it does help is some scenes, not all, have funny camaraderie with the group, with Terry Crews, Dolph Lundgren, and Jason Statham. When they can all interact, like going over what their ideal final meal would be (and lines like 'Cereal, how about Earrios?'), it's genuinely fun.<br/><br/>Other times, when the action ramps up like in the opening, and especially the last twenty minutes of the movie, it just ramps up being totally senseless except for LOTS AND LOTS OF DEAD BODIES! And one- liners (""I now pronounce you men and knife"" ""(Insert old-catch phrase here)""). It's still not technically *good* filmmaking or storytelling, per-say, but I could enjoy its dumbness when I left my more critical faculties. That is, except when Stallone himself would try to seriously act, even in small instances, which made me most embarrassed of all as he has lost most of the charisma that used to be with him as a star in his hey-day. In reality, the Expendables 2 works best with anyone *not* Stallone, be it Van Damme's cardboard villain, the other Expendables interacting, and even by Willis/Ah-nuld/Norris. Yes, Norris, the most overrated action star of the past thirty years has his moment in the sun.<br/><br/>The movie made me alternately bored, ashamed, entertained, amused, thrilled, and dulled by the action and chaotic violence, to the point where I lost track of the body count and wanted the chaotic- unintentional-comedy to be ramped up further. While Expendables 2 is a Bad-Good improvement (if that makes sense, which it probably doesn't), I hope if they make a third one to get someone more ingrained in over-the- top B-movie-dom like Robert Rodriguez. The movie at times goes over the edge into the absurd, but then it goes back to being the same sort of just-OKAY tribute to the older action flicks and star vehicles. I say, make it MORE meta and MORE gonzo. Then you'll have something different and truly exciting."

","Yes, I gave it 9 out of 10. I normally don't do that. Why did I give it 9 out of 10? Not out of sentiment. I gave it 9 / 10 because Expendables 2 is simply hilarious and entertaining from start to finish.<br/><br/>STORY<br/><br/>well, the trailer pretty much covers the entire story when Stallone says: 'find em, track em, kill em'. Yes, no Oscar work here. but who cares? The bad guys have stuff that the good guys don't want them to have. Both sides have craploads of weaponry. You can see where this is going.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS<br/><br/>Basically, everyone plays a version of themselves from a 90-ies action flick. In essence, we have Rambo, Crank, John mcClane, the terminator, Walker Texas Ranger, He-Man and assorted dudes in 1 film. JcvD gets to play the bad guy. And does so quite well. don't expect any superb acting or character development though.<br/><br/>SPECIAL EFFECTS<br/><br/>lots and LOTS of explosions. That about covers it. Oh, and 1 crappy CGI helicopter getting shot down by an unmanned CGI motorcycle. Yes, you read that right. this -is- the Expendables, after all.<br/><br/>THE GOOD STUFF<br/><br/>So why is this movie so much fun to watch? you have to go see this movie if you re from the Delta Force / Rambo / terminator Die Hard generation. Seriously. the movie contains tons of jokes and references to those old action movies. Thats 1 strong point.<br/><br/>2nd strong point: this movie does not take itself seriously, nor do the actors. and thats why there's so much magic in the air. You can see the energy beaming off all the old skoolers doing their thing. Some 1 liners are so hilarious you actually choke. Best one goes to (who else but) Chuck Norris shortly after he is introduced.<br/><br/>3rd strong point: the most obvious one. the participating actors. so much win in 1 film. the magic. it's simply so much fun to see all the old schoolers going at it in the same movie.<br/><br/>4th strong point. the plot twists.<br/><br/>No, not really. Seriously, no.<br/><br/>TL: DR;<br/><br/>Expendables 2 is VERY entertaining. It delivers more than its prequel, and then some. Willis and schwarzenegger get bigger roles. even Norris has a lengthy cameo. there's over the top action, 1 liners, winks and references to old movies. I've no idea how long it was but time flew by and after the 275289456359th explosion it was already over and left me wanting for more.<br/><br/>A must see if you want to have some old school fun, no strings attached.<br/><br/>do leave your brain at the door and don't be a critic. Do so and you'll have a blast."

","I watched this movie simply because I am a fan of adrenaline pumping action movies. And the icing on the cake are those legendary action stars who all have their unique presence on the screen. <br/><br/>The movie is better than the first movie by a mile and has more of those action sequences. It has cool fight sequences and Sly, Jet Li and Jason Statham prove their metal, while Arnold, Dolph, Chuck Norris and Van Damne have far less scenes to flex their muscles apart from the odd one or two scenes. Sly and Statham are the highlights of this movie and carry the entire movie on their ever so trusted shoulders. The rest of the cast are not bad but feel overshadowed including Arnie. The plot is straightforward and pretty predictable. Blood and guns are the major things you lay your eyes while watching this movie. Each member of the Expendables have their own strengths and are displayed effectively.<br/><br/>Watch this movie if you want to see your favourite action stars kick some butt.

They should have included Rajini Kanth also ...I missed him badly but then if Rajini is there then others will have nothing much to do ... The movie anyways didn't have any storyline ... or the line was there but they blasted that also along with others ... Probably more people flied in to the air than the combined stunt men in ""Independence Day"", ""Shoot em' up"" and ""Commando"" put together ...and of course there were more blasts than any of the Micheal bay movies and yes there was more fire power than the opening ceremony of London Olympics ...

"KineticSeoul","7","2","5","22 August 2012"," Actually met my expectations unlike the first one
","While the first ""The Expendables"" was a disappointing this one makes up for it. If you can vision a lot of the 80's and modern action movies stars that are badass on screen come together for one explosive action flick this is it for the most part. While the blood in this might be CGI a lot of it is real action and explosion with plenty of violence. The mercenaries are back and this time there is more at stake and more of a cause. Because one of their teammate gets killed and the mercenaries, especially Barney Ross is out for revenge for his fallen comrade. Plus the enemy has there hands on some weapons of mass destruction when the mercenaries lead by Barney Ross goes on a mission because of Mr. Church(Bruce Willis) because they owe him money. In fact Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger actually gets some hands on action this time and not just a small cameo. The first ""The Expendables"" Jason Statham took most of the spotlight but this time a lot of the other members brings something to the table. It would have been better if it had more Jet Li in it, but he basically just makes a cameo with a small fraction of fight scenes which is in the beginning. It would have been awesome to see Jean-Claude Van Damme vs. Jet Li fight scene. Jean-Claude Van Damme is the main villain in this movie and man that guys knows how to play a bad guy that is entertaining to watch. And wish he had more fight scenes and screen presence. Randy Couture is the toughest guy in the bunch in real life but his fight sequences are brutal but their isn't enough of it, hope he gets more screen time with some brutal mixed martial arts. Terry Crews adds a bit more comedy this time around as Hale Ceasar. Chuch Norris is basically a homage to what he has become and it was good to see him in this movie owning his enemies without much effort. If your a action fan this is a movie you shouldn't miss. Even if the story is lacking it makes up for it with some explosive badass action with some mayhem and one liners that is corny but is entertaining to watch. If you know some of the action stars and the movies they were in you might enjoy this flick more since this is a throwback to the 80's action movies.<br/><br/>7.8/10"

He didn't really fight but it was cool to see him in the movie. I like the way the ""old men"" characters were described in the movie by old characters. I was very upset to see Jet Li leave at the beginning of the movie and they replace him with some Asian GIRL. All in all I did love and enjoyed the movie. I definitely recommend going to see it.

","Watching the old-fashioned, larger-than-life, male-bonding epic ""The Expendables 2"" is like taking a nostalgic jaunt down memory lane. A gallery of brawny 1980s era, action-hero icons assembles for this testosterone-laden, blood bath that depicts combat on land, sea, and in the air with double-digit body counts. At one point, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Bruce Willis stand shoulder-to-shoulder, armed with automatic weapons, firing fusillades of bullets into wave after wave of approaching bad guys. Joining Stallone, Schwarzenegger, and Willis this time out are two more 1980s era actors: Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme. Along with these legendary leading men, newcomers Liam Hemsworth, Scott Adkins, and Nan Yu dodge bullets, too. Jason Statham, Jet Li, Randy Couture, Terry Crews, and Dolph Lundgren reprise their roles as Barney Ross's tough-as-nails mercenaries. Just as sentimental as the original ""Expendables,"" ""Expendables 2"" drums up ten times more carnage and demolition in a remote Bosnian setting. Unlike the original, this ambitious sequel provides Schwarzenegger and Willis with far more substantial roles. While the dialogue consists of amusing one-liners served up over twenty years ago in the advertising campaigns of ""The Terminator"" and ""Die Hard,"" the screenplay penned by Stallone and ""16 Blocks"" scribe Richard Wenk qualifies as a standard-issue revenge thriller. Basically, you should prepare yourself for lots of eardrum numbing battle sequences interspersed with soul-searching dialogue scenes among the principals when they aren't in the line of fire. Nothing has really changed aside from a fresh, new setting in Albania that appears scenic in its own grungy way.<br/><br/>""The Expendables 2"" erupts with a series of slam-bang action scenes that resemble something that ""The A-Team"" tried to pull off every week during its five-year run on NBC. Barney Ross and his pals show up in a squalid-looking town in Nepal on a 'do or die' mission to rescue a Chinese billionaire from some nasty extortionists. They careen into the city in military vehicles designed to smash through barriers of any description. These swiftly-moving vehicles have clever names stenciled on them, such as 'knock-knock' and 'bad attitude.' Mind you, it doesn't matter that our heroes are hopelessly outnumbered because they devastate the opposition mercilessly with artillery blasts and bursts from .50 caliber machine guns. At one point, Barney (Sylvester Stallone of 1981's ""Nighthawks"") cranks up a motorcycle and wields it like a weapon to bring down a helicopter. Our heroes evacuate in motor-driven boats but find themselves pursued by trigger-happy soldiers in 'Everglades' air-boats armed with mortars. Barney and Lee Christmas (Jason Statham of 1998's '\""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"") recover their seaplane and sweep down out of the sky like the cavalry as the villains are drawing a bead on their comrades. There is even a revelation or two in all this bullet-riddled mayhem that takes Barney by surprise before they make their getaway.<br/><br/>After a few beers, Barney runs into the dubiously named Mr. Church (Bruce Willis of 1988's ""Die Hard"") who has been waiting for him at the latter's aircraft hangar. Church dispatches Barney Ross and his cronies on 'a walk in the park' mission to crack a safe in a crashed jetliner. Church surprises Barney when he sends one of his own operatives who can open the mysterious safe without atomizing the object. Initially, Barney is flatly against bringing a woman along who he'll have to babysit. As it turns out, Maggie Chan (NanYu of ""Diamond Dogs"") allays Barney's anxieties that she won't be able to keep up with the team. Maggie looks extremely lethal in combat against multiple male opponents. Our heroes have no problem locating the wreckage of the jet and minor complications ensue after they find the safe. Unfortunately, everything goes awry afterward, when an army of sadistic villains intervenes, demands those contents, and threatens to execute one of Barney's unit if they don't lay down their arms and hand over what they found in the plane crash. Motivated as much by the loss of one from their own ranks, Barney and company set out in furious pursuit of the villains. An Eastern European crime cartel headed by an appropriately named Jean Villain (Jean Claude Van Damme of 1988's ""No Retreat, No Surrender "") has no qualms about killing. The information liberated from the safe contains the whereabouts of five-tons of plutonium abandoned by the Russians in a derelict mine during the Cold War. Villain and his menacing minions have recruited slave labor from the location population at gunpoint to help them excavate the plutonium.<br/><br/>Director Simon West, who helmed ""Con-Air,"" ""Laura Croft, Tomb Raider,"" and ""The Mechanic,"" rarely allows the pace to slow down in this noisy extravaganza, especially when the heroes and villains are blasting away at each other with murderous glee. West and ""xXx: State of the Union"" editor Todd E. Miller never unnecessarily linger on a single image. Some of the editing seems almost subliminal. Clocking in at a nimble 102 minutes, ""The Expendables 2"" offers double the action with double the stars. ""Lone Wolf McQuade"" star Chuck Norris finds himself in the fray and shows that he still possesses the stamina. It is difficult to believe that all these guys, who once battled it out among themselves for box office supremacy, have come together to make such an outlandish but entertaining opus. For the record, Dolph Lundgren's character, Gunnar, has cleaned up his act from the original and is back with Barney and company. Gunnar still picks on agile, pint-sized Jet Li while Barney and Lee bicker with each other about anything and everything. If you saw ""The Expendables,"" you know that Lee Christmas had fallen in love with a gal who let her sadistic boyfriend beat up on her. Lee and Lacy (Charisma Carpentar of TV's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") are now a couple. Conspicuously missing from the cast is Mickey Rourke who played Tool in the original. If you loved the original ""Expendables,"" you'll love ""The Expendables 2."""
"dmhughes-448-695102","4","19","116","13 August 2012"," It's The Same Film We've Seen Before, Only With More Bad Actors
","Well, we should have known it would come to this. The Expendables 2. I didn't see the original film until earlier this year on television. I thought it was lousy, and I still can't believe it crushed Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World at the box office. Every actor except Jason Statham was terrible, the special effects were sub-par, the cinematography was pitiful, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis were underused, and Sylvester Stallone proved once again that he couldn't write a decent script (Rocky was an exception) or direct a good movie. Now we have an unnecessary sequel. I won't give away any spoilers, but I will say this film brings action stars Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris to the table, and they're terrible as always. I do admit, it was funny watching Chuck Norris killing bad guys, considering he's 72, but he's just an excuse for Stallone and Co. to say that they have another washed-out movie star in their midst. <br/><br/>This film is directed by Simon West, but he's never been a good filmmaker. He's a little better filming the action scenes, but the script, once again penned by Stallone, gives him nothing to work with. Overall, this is a slightly better film than the first one, but that's like comparing Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans and trying to argue which one is the best. This is another vain attempt at 80's nostalgia, but there's a reason why people don't make movies like that anymore: they were cheap, stupid, and had bad acting, but now producers have the money to make great action films, and this is just an attempt to cash in on nostalgia. I will say Arnold and Bruce are in the film a little more this time around, but even that still can't save this film.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 4/10"
"HumanoidOfFlesh","9","2","6","2 September 2012"," They are back and ready to spill the blood.
","The Expendables are back.This time Barney Ross(Sly Stallone)and his pack of mercenaries including Jason Statham,Jet Li,Dolph Lundgren,Terry Crews,Randy Couture and Liam Hemsworth are sent to Albania to fight with Jean Villain(Jean-Claude Van Damme) and his plutonium seeking cohorts.The climax which takes place at the airport is truly mind-blowing.Chuck Norris,Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis appear too to shoot as many villains as they can.""The Expendables 2"" is even more thrilling and high on action than its fantastic prequel ""The Expendables"".It oozes testosterone.The opening sequence which takes place in Nepal features one hell of furious action.Several one-liners are lovingly funny for example:Arnold:I'll be back.Bruce Willis: No.You've been back too many times.This time,I'll be back.9 alpha mercenaries out of 10."
"sbaldwin999","8","2","6","1 September 2012"," Exactly what it should be
","Arnold is awesome and hilarious, as is Bruce Willis, and scenes with their exchanges are the funniest parts of the movie. Chuck Norris delivers some awkward lines but when the action scenes roll around, he really shines. It's funny that he is does not like swearing in movies but has no problem blowing enemies to tiny pieces with his machine gun. Everyone else is good except Jet Li, who unfortunately vanishes after the beginning... this is sad because I am a huge kung fu fan... (although, Jason Statham and Nan Yu do provide some cool kung fu fights, they can't compare to a wushu master like Li).<br/><br/>Van Damme was the most pleasant surprise for me. Normally his line delivery garners a few laughs... not here though, he is ruthless and nasty, exactly how I like my villains.<br/><br/>The plot is so cookie-cutter that it's hardly worth mentioning (bad guys want hidden soviet plutonium, to sell to more bad guys... That's pretty much it.). So instead lets talk about the real reason you are going to see this... the action.<br/><br/>There are several action scenes that are all very fast and furious. They never overstay their welcome and it seems like every character gets equal camera time (except maybe Couture and of course, Li). Nobody gets shot in this movie unless quarts of blood spray from them and paint the walls. On top of the gun play there are some excellent knife fights, although one with Statham might be a little too ""V for Vendetta-y"", if you catch my drift. There are also hand to hand combat fights of both the 'kung fu' and 'brawling' variety.<br/><br/>There is a great fight scene at the beginning, then a better one in the middle, in a village and then the most excellent one comes at the end in an airport. This was great cause I feel like it's been too long since a modern action movie doesn't use the best action scenes up at the start of the film (like in Ninja Assassin). It had me leaving the theater sufficiently satisfied, so that was a big factor in me giving it a high rating.<br/><br/>Lastly and most importantly, the one liners. There are an abundance in this movie (as it should be!) and they range from lame and awkwardly delivered to amazing with perfect timing. One thing I didn't like was Arnold saying ""I'll be back!"" about a hundred times... yea, we get it, he was the terminator, but the man has plenty of other great one liners... use them too! On the other hand, one I did like was when a man get riddled with so much gunfire that he pretty much explodes to pieces, to which Stallone says, ""rest in pieces"", right on queue... now that's awesome!"
"athagen","8","2","6","20 August 2012"," Why don't they make more movies like this!
","Action, action fun.. Van Damme as a villain works fantastic. Braindead maybe but still it's just great. This is a film you know what you are getting, and it does not disappoint. Great scenes and lot's of funny one liners. I laughed and smiled most of the time, you just got to take the movie for what it is. Plain action comedy, and it delivers. To bad Jet Li didn't have a bigger role but still, the rest just made magic. I wish i could see Jean-Claude Van Damme in more movies. He's raw as an villain. The setting's and effects are very good, this screams high budget and nothing looks like it's been cut back. Over all, this is a guy's movie night dream come true."

","You know how in every movie (with the exception of the Avengers) there are parts you could do without?? Well not in this movie!! It starts off with an awesome action sequence that had me fearing that it would be as good as it gets, but then, each scene that follows is either just as awesome or has me ready to say 'stop the movie' because it couldn't possibly get any better......but it does!!!<br/><br/>The entire cast has their moments of brilliance and thus each deserved their place in this epic. The cameos may make it extra special but I have to give it to Dolph Lungren (who I wouldn't have minded if they'd ad of killed off in the first one), he and his character really improved enough to make me like him again. The director deserves just as much, if not more praise for making this not only a fantastic homage to the greatest action stars and films of all time, but for also piecing together unreal action sequences and well placed humour into just the most awesome 110mins of cinema viewing I have no problem repeating again and again.<br/><br/>In summary, if you liked the first one, you'll love this one. And if you were a fan of the classic action movies of the 80's and 90's, you're mind will be blown by how amazing this film is. This film has set an Everest of a benchmark for the next generation of action stars to follow.<br/><br/>My only regret is that I will never see Expendables 2 for the first time ever again!"

","So, after watching the first one and finding it stupid but entertaining, I watched this and I just wonder WHY do they need all those famous actors to do a crap like this. This is such a waste of potential. It is just boom boom all the time, no real power, no intensity, no epic, no elegance, no speed, no thrill, no suspense, no nothing. You call this action? This is a meaningless mess! And all those actors together become boring after a while. Instead of multiplying each other their individual strength, they lose intensity because all is just a chaos and none of them has enough space. The storyline is null. The script is childish. The supposed funny lines make not laugh anybody. Why should somebody laugh with Chuck Norris who makes a joke on himself like the ones you can find in Internet, about a Cobra who's beaten him and died in agony? Why should be funny that somebody says to Arnold ""if you do not give it back to me I will terminate your ass""? Because everybody will think about Terminator? This is so POOR, so stupid... Plot has more holes than a Gruyere. Actually plot IS a hole, with some action around. The fights and killings are ridiculous, people are there coming in hordes just to be killed, without the MINIMUM realism. Stallone and the other writers do not understand that what makes an Hero strong are his strong enemies. If a Giant fights against many little powerless creatures and kill them all, nobody is impressed. But if two people of great power fight each other, the fight is memorable! Here you have a lot of ""big"" heroes against a brunch of powerless ants. As said, NO INTENSITY. The only bad ""hero"" is Van Damme. This is a MISTAKE. It would have been much more interesting to have a corresponding number of equally big villains. 10 big Heroes, ten big villains. Or so. By the way, these supposed heroes look so unimportant in this movie. The ONLY one who brings something interesting to the movie is Jason. Apart for when he must act a funny line, badly written by, hmmm, who wrote this terrible script by the way? So much money and they could not even pay a decent writer? The only good line in the entire movie was the one between Stallone and Arnold at the end: ""that thing is for a museum"" ""we all are"". Yes. You are!"
"tieman64","Null","1","2","21 December 2013"," I now pronounce you man and knife
","Simon West's ""The Expendables 2"" is an action comedy which misses the point of its own novelty. Hoping to stoke the flames of nostalgia, the film collects several classic action movie stars (Jet Li, Chuck Norris, Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren, Bruce Willis) but then makes them play second fiddle to a conventional plot which is several times worse than the many B movies the film emulates.<br/><br/>West would have done better to go smaller rather than bigger, showing these macho heroes in absurd scenarios which we've never before seen. Stallone getting a pedicure? Schwarzenegger working for Green Peace? Lundgren as a store clerk? Jet Li at the laundromat? Van Damme as a Spanish tutor? Statham as a gay cross dresser? Norris as an ultra right-wing Christian on a crusade to turn R rated action movies pg13 (oh wait)? I'd pay to see that.<br/><br/>But alas, no. West's ""The Expendables 2"" is generic gun porn, in which muscular dudes with old faces perforate bad guys and homo-erotically ejaculate blood in tight clothing. Most action movies become camp with time. ""Expendables 2"" needs more camp.<br/><br/>4/10 √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú Worth one viewing."

It only took a couple of minutes of the opening scene for me to recall that I have seen this one before.<br/><br/>Not surprised by my memory lapse, I went on to watch this flick once again and I think it was better seeing it the 2nd time. There was a lot of action right from the beginning and ebbed and flowed throughout the entire flick.<br/><br/>A decent plot kept me interested and seeing all those old timers acting in this was a treat in itself.

","This film is about a group of fighters who try to stop people from stealing plutonium from a disused Russian mine.<br/><br/>The amount of action scenes in ""The Expendables 2"" is quite mind blowing. The film starts off with a five minute street battle scene with heave artillery, and we don't even know why they are fighting. Forty minutes into the film, we finally know the aim of the mission. There is so much fighting, gun shots, aerial chases, bombs going off and heads blown off, that I sometimes forget there is actually a plot! It is s action intense that it becomes funny. For example, they slide off a wire and shoot bad guys, and they manage to kill someone with every bullet! Well, at least they are wearing bullet proof vest, so that makes it a little more believable.<br/><br/>Dialogs are sparsely interspersed, and mostly they are one liners that are so bad that it becomes good. For example, ""I pronounce you man and knife"" is just plain funny. The blood splatter from gun shots are so comical that it looks more like a paint ball fight.

","The main appeal that caught your attention on the first film was the cast and while it failed to deliver, watching these iconic action stars hero's together was fun. Thankfully, a balance has been inserted in The Expendables 2, an warm glow that couldn't be felt in the first film. The characters know there role and for that, the film progresses organically rather than stuttering along, throwing explosives and head-shots at you every 15 minutes.<br/><br/>And with the new additions added to the cast list, the action scenario that Stallone strives for with film number one are now palpable. The inclusion of JCVD is enough to make you want to watch it, no matter how disgusted you were at TE1. And this leads me to say: it's easy to mix JCVD with Norris, more so after laughing at his tight pants, but here, playing as the villain, he completely stoles the show. The only scene with him that let me down was the final fight scene but no big deal. And of course Norris; made more famous by the internet than the films he has starred in. His role might be brief, but that doesn't stop him from adding a dosage of humorous charm.<br/><br/>TE2 is very much like the first film but without the rigidness. The story is sufficient for an action film and the action scene's themselves are brilliantly shot.<br/><br/>so tight."

","I must say, I haven't seen the first Expendables movie so I don't exactly know if this is better than that though many say this certainly is much better. I knew watching this movie that I shouldn't set high expectations and that this is just a fun bloody movie. The best thing about the movie is the fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously, meaning it is self aware of itself.<br/><br/>The Expendables 2 is about a group of men called the Expendables who upon the loss of one of their men, seek revenge on Villain and his men whilst also attempting to stop Plutonium being transported away. The story isn't the important thing in this movie and it makes it very clear during the movie. The whole purpose to the movie is to see our favorite action stars, namely Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone join up in one big action movie. This film delivers them mostly to a satisfying level.<br/><br/>Despite having fun with the movie I do have issues with a few things namely the small roles for Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris, Jet Li and Bruce Willis. These people are such big names when it comes to action stars that they have so little to do in this movie. I mean, Jet Li's presence in the movie was so disappointing. We see him kicking ass for a few minutes and he's gone. He would've been such a great addition if he was a bigger part of it.<br/><br/>Even though Stallone makes up the most of the group of Expendables, this film has other action stars that aren't as important as ones like Arnold, Bruce Willis, Chuck Norris and Jet Li. They, along with Stallone should've been what made the Expendables group. That would've been an ultimate badass movie. The fact that my favorite action heroes have so little in the movie is extremely disappointing.<br/><br/>Back to the good of the movie. The acting is both a mess and good at the same time but the film knows that its not about the acting but its about bringing these stars together. The script is awful but the film is aware of it and we even see some classic one liners, especially 'I'll be back!' and 'Yipee Kiyay' The action in this movie is superb. It was extremely entertaining to watch it but the digital blood is quite annoying at times especially the overuse of it. However that being said, this movie is certainly a lot of fun and full of action from start to finish so this is definitely a must see for die hard 1980's action fans!"

Jason, The Expendables 2 has to be refreshing to all those who grew up in the 1980s with these muscle men. This should've very well been the first movie in the series, but since that's neither here, nor there, allow me to exclaim: I fraking loved this movie, and I wasn't even the biggest fan of these guys back then.<br/><br/>This is the Piranha 3D of 2012: the movie never lied about what it was all about and gave us all everything we wanted. Such as a straight-line plot, hilarious lines, great action and quick-to-the-point scenarios. This movie absolutely started with a bang, never let up and got progressively better until the outright 1980s/1990s fantastic climax. I cannot express how much I had a blast during this.<br/><br/>And this is coming from someone who loves originality and unpredictable films, of which this was neither. Again, this movie provided everything to satisfy a decades old combo-pack of action stars. As stated, this reminded me a lot of Piranha 3D: Everything that was foreseen for people who grew up loving those types of movies was granted.<br/><br/>I wanted to see the stars Jason Statham, Sylvester Stallone and Randy Couture show their awesome moves (namely, my favorite action star of the entire cast, Statham ‚Äì he was awesome) and co-stars, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Jet Li all kick ass, and they did. Further, I've never been a Jean-Claude Van Damme fan, but was welcoming his signature kick. And this, I proclaim, is my very first Chuck Norris film I've seen. Despite him not front-running the show, it's still my first (and enjoyable) experience of his on screen presence.<br/><br/>When the only thing that disappointed me was the extreme lack of Jet Li and no Jackie Chan invited to the party ‚Äì I mean, c'mon guys! ‚Äì then, I know the positives surely outweighed the measly negatives.<br/><br/>The plot ‚Äì ha, this is a purposely retread of all of those involved's past movies ‚Äì is fairly simple: to settle a debt, the D-Team must retrieve an object, lose it and seek revenge and redemption and become heroes.<br/><br/>I probably would've hated such a clich√©d movie¬Ötwenty-thirty years ago. And I usually did. But, when you make it such a tongue-in-cheek and fun ride such as this, you can't help but smile and enjoy the trip.<br/><br/>Recap: The Expendables (2010): 2/5 Stars. The Expendables 2 (2012): 4/5 Stars. Hmm, not all sequels are inferior.<br/><br/>And even with the inevitable The Expendables 3, and there's nothing I can do to stop that, I hope they take the lessons learned here: Continue to have fun making it, take nothing serious and remember Jackie Chan's still alive!"

If all you want to know is if the sequel is better you don't have to look far, it defiantly is. From the start of the movie the message is clear. Huge guns, lots of explosions, and one-liners spit out at a mile a minute.<br/><br/>The cast of characters is even bigger this time around. If I say Rambo, The Terminator, and John MCclane all together on one screen and you say ""Who?"" stop reading right now, this movie is not for you. On the other hand if that sounds like a dream come true, there will be some memorable moments to look forward to. Of all the actors I'd say Jason Statham had the best performance. If you asked me to rate him I'd say it was okay. That doesn't say much for the state of the acting as a whole. It's a very mixed bag. The main problem is the script. It feels almost B movie quality with some brilliant lines mixed in. Stallone, Statham, Liam Hemsworth were in the upper tier of acting while everyone else was on a small level below. Chuck Norris even makes an appearance. I'm sorry to say that he had the worst delivery of his lines. You could tell he had not acted in ages. Of course he did have time to drop a Chuck Norris joke that I've already heard a million times. He kind of redeemed himself at the end though. His appearance was more of a cameo anyway. Arnold Schwarzenegger had to be my favorite. He wasn't on screen for very long but I had a huge grin on my face whenever he was. He has the best one-liners, I was laughing so hard I had to rewind it to hear what I missed. In fact, this one is somewhat of an attempted comedy. It borders on parody sometimes. This movie won't be mentioned at the Oscars any time soon.<br/><br/>This move is not really about acting, script, or even storyline. It's about all the best action stars getting on one screen and blowing you away by the action. The action consists of shoot outs, fist fights, explosive detonations, and knife fights all while the heroes never die and the bad guys always do. It's humorously over the top. I love near the end when Arnold has a shotgun and he's just blowing away everybody, just awesome. The scene at the end is really the redeeming part of the whole movie. Everyone's in a huge airport show down with Van Damme and his thugs. Statham has the coolest fights with his knives. He slices and dices his way through a bunch of thugs with style. There is a cool fight between Stallone and Van Damme at the end. It was very brutal. Van Damme delivered his signature kick with surprising athletic ability. He still has it after all these years.<br/><br/>The technical aspects were only okay. You could obviously tell when they used CG. Sometimes the plane would be flying and it looked like it was just added into the picture. The music was nothing to write home about, typical pump up action movie stuff. I guess it does the job though. All in all the most important thing was the shooting and hand to hand combat and they both looked good.<br/><br/>In summary, I did enjoy the movie despite its many flaws. I'd say rent this one or wait for it to come to Netflix. I would give it a 6.5/10 tkubas1.wordpress.com"

Second why bother bringing in Liam if he is to die in first 10 min, would have never happened if jet li was there and not some dumb chick. You BETTER fix your mistakes in the next one. Lastly you also better leave out Chuck Norris, omg his voice is annoying. Ps why would you leave out Mickey rourke all together? Hello!!!!!!!!! We wanted to see him more than some annoying woman with Jason, didn't like her in Buffy, hated her in angel, what makes you think we'd like her in this?!?!?

You can guess what happens to such an idealistic young man who is the only one in the group with something to lose. I think this movie was written by an eighth grader with a book of clich√©s doing most of the work for him. The only thing missing from this desensitizing bloodbath were naked ladies.<br/><br/>Somehow old guys with guns keep showing up and saving the day at just the right moment. Chuck Norris has the lamest role in the whole film and doesn't even roundhouse, or backfist, one person. Arnold only says what he has said in every other film he has ever been in. Stallone mumbles unintelligibly throughout. Statham has so many knives hidden in his coat you'd think he was a Cutco salesman. You only get one scene with Jet Li before he disappears without explanation for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>This movie sucks. Hard. Couple this with the soundtrack which has two orchestras playing the score. One is a competent Hollywood symphony playing the notes that were written, while simultaneously a group of middle schoolers in beginning band try their best to play off key. It is really painful to listen to.<br/><br/>Van Damme gets to show that he can act, but only for one scene before he goes the way of the rest.<br/><br/>In the end they win. But we all lose."

","Typically I think it would be safe to say that if you put together several of the top action movie stars in an action movie you'd not only draw a lot of viewers, but you might start a series of Expendable movies that could conceivably stretch out for years. I'm guessing that was the plan when this was conceived, but they forgot that a story should also be part of the plan, not just shoot em up, punch-em out, kick their butt action with absolutely no story to hang their white hats on. This 2nd attempt to bring these super tough guys together fails miserably as a movie, yes there is plenty of action, stunts, and killing, in fact I'd guess that over 200 kills alone in this last pathetic attempt to entertain. Here's the bottom line on this film, if all you are interested in is seeing these stars kick butt, this one is exactly what you want and need. However, if you would like to see a story with a plot, with a meaningful storyline to make the violence and multiple killing sprees have some bearing, forget about this movie and hope a sequel is NOT in the offing."

Every scene with some content is just a stupid clich√® and you have to feel ashamed for the actor.<br/><br/>The story is straight forward without any twists and surprises. The ""anger factor"" (Stallone's killed pseudo son) is so cheap and simple I couldn't adapt with that and favoured the bad team the whole movie.

Cleverly planted dialogs also adds to the humor in between the action. However, it lacks the right blend of all the star cast as it was there in the 1st part. Jet Li vanishes after you blink once. It's more of Stallone & Statham. Van Damme has been shown unlike his usual earlier characters - running. His fight with Stallone ended just too soon and keeps your thirst only half quenched.

The story line was good and this DVD will be added to the collection as soon as it hits the store shelves. The only critiques for me are that I thought the old clich√©'s where used just a little too much, and I would have enjoyed the final battle better if it was Norris or Li v Van Damme. Can't wait for the next installment,hopefully it will include Cage, Snipes, Russell and Travolta, Clint is perhaps just too old, and perhaps Seagal could replace Van Damme as the villain and I would like to see the film as a more serious edge of the seat Thriller.

","The Expendables 2 (2012) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>The Expendables go on what's supposed to be a simple mission but when one of their own is killed they plan to take vengeance against a terrorist (Jean-Claude Van Damme) who's behind it. I enjoyed the first film very much and this one is also a lot of fun and I might put it a notch above the first one because this one here never takes itself too serious and instead it really does feel like Action Hero Heaven has opened up and the stars are just kicking back and having some fun. They get to fire large guns, say silly one-liners and the body count here is probably ten times bigger than any of their previous films put together. The movie certainly earns its R-rating because the violence is pretty much non-stop and the gore level is off the charts. It's never graphic or disturbing, all of it is done in good taste and it remains entertaining from start to finish. Stallone, Lundgren, Willis, Schwarzenegger, Crews, Courture, Liam Hemsworth, Li and Statham are all incredibly fun here and the chemistry among them is great. It's clear that everyone is having a good time with the material and I really liked how well they played off one another and the film was in such good spirit that each of them can make fun of themselves. Chuck Norris gets an extended cameo here and his scenes are downright terrific as the filmmakers clearly have some fun with him going around blowing people away. His introduction and final shots are classic. To me the real standout was Van Damme who makes for a perfect villain and I really hope this gets him into some more pictures. I haven't been following his DTV stuff so it's been a very long time since I last saw one of his movies but he's so cold and evil here that I wish he had more screen time. Director Simon West keeps the energy level going high from start to finish and there's no question he knows how to make things go boom. THE EXPENDABLES 2 is a lot of fun and it shows what these throwback action films should be like."

","I remember in 2010 being really, really excited about upcoming release The Expendables. I've been a fan of all the big action stars since I was a child, and seeing the trailer for EX1 had me buzzing in anticipation. I DID love the movie when I saw it but was left kinda underwhelmed due to Eric Roberts being a pretty lame bad guy and Terry Crews, Randy Couture and Dolph not being involved with the team enough. Fast forward two years and they have righted those wrongs and also added way more bang for your bucks. Pretty much every scene features Couture, Crews, Statham, Dolph and Sly killing bad guys and making wise cracks together, plus way more fantastic screen time for Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. They are joined by new sniper Billy The Kid (Liam Hensworth) as Jet Li has had enough of the mercenary lifestyle and gone home. On a mission to rescue a Chinese kidnapping hostage in Nepal, the mercs encounter their old friend Trent (Schwarzenegger) and save the day. Trying to relax after their latest mission, they are thrown in to the deep end by Mr Church (Willis), who isn't happy that they took his money and didn't follow his orders in the first movie. He is sending them on a secret mission in Eastern Europe to retrieve a computer program used for creating bombs from plutonium. The problem is they are beaten to the device by the evil Jean Villain (Jean Claude Van Damme, at his glorious OTT evil best) and a member of the team is killed. Church isn't impressed and warns them they have to recover this device at all costs, and the crew are out for revenge and gunning for Villain and his henchmen. Throw in some wise-cracking ass-kicking from action legend Chuck Norris to the mayhem being dished out by Sly, Arnie and the gang and you have the greatest action movie ever to grace the big screen. This is shameless manliness at its best, highlighted by a shootout where Dolph and Sly happily high five after blowing away dozens of bad guys. I have just seen this movie in an advanced preview tonight (16 Aug) and I can safely say I have never left a movie theatre so entertained in all my life. I've been to comedies that didn't get as many laughs as this movie, with so many classic one-liners and gags added to almost all of the action. Seeing Chuck Norris pull one of his own internet 'Chuck Norris jokes' was worth the admission alone, and the climax of the movie gave me goosebumps- nothing will top seeing Chuck Norris, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone join forces and dispatch hundreds of bad guys in all their glory. If you want big stars, one-liners, guns, explosions, entertainment and a barrel of laughs then this is the movie for you. An absolute epic action movie!!! Only Expendables III can top this now..."

Maybe that is true. The fact remains that movies have progressed and movies in this style look stupidly dated nowadays like safari suits, kipper ties, afros and discos. there is a reason people stopped making movies like this. The reason is that they were unwatchable.<br/><br/>Like the concept and the genre the stars look well past their sell by date.<br/><br/>Stallone looks terrible nowadays and his toupee is pretty obvious. Chuck Norris has been wearing a terrible toupee for so long that I suppose people don't care any more. Worst of all Arnie looks like a grotesque caricature of his former self.Bodybuilders don't age gracefully.<br/><br/>The plot is so thin that I'd forgotten it by the time I came to write these comments, he acting is as awful as you would expect from these hasbeens.

","Read some reviews of this and the critics complained about the clich√©s used in this (""I'll be back""). Actually, if I hadn't read about this, it wouldn't have bothered me. In fact, when the time came to hear this, I didn't care. This is the movie you go to see the guys whom you haven't seen in a while. Most of them made zillions of dollars in their action flicks and now here they are years later, and they look good. They've added Liam Hemsworth, and you can't complain because he and his brother Chris are easy on the eyes. They've also added Nan Yu, who blends in nicely with the gang of tough dudes. The opening scene is great, as you get to see each guy show off his strengths. Jet Li has a wonderful martial arts segment and Jason Statham plays with knives. Everything seems to be going well until Church (Bruce Willis) comes along to get Ross (Stallone) to pay on his debt. Ross reluctantly takes on the job, but tragedy befalls one of the crew. That puts Ross in revenge mode. The Villain, played wonderfully by Jean-Claude Van Damme is not going to be easy to catch. And then there's the play on words with his name: Villain. Van Damme aged well, and does show off his signature kicks in the show-down with Ross. But who really steals the show is Chuck Norris. Figuring the guy is 70-something, he comes in a blazing with his guns. And there's the play on the names with him: ""Lone Wolf"" from Lone Wolf McQuade and ""Booker"" from Good Guys Wear Black. There is a lot of blood in this, hence the R rating. It moves quickly and it delivers. The sets are so-so, but you really don't care because you know they're going to get blown up anyway. This is one of those fun, action flicks that you go to see and not care about the story line or the sets. It's fun and they should definitely go for an Expendables 3. How about digging up a few other oldies but goodie action heroes like, Michelle Yeoh, who just turned 50 this year, and Yun-Fat Chow, who's 57. Both were wonderful in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. And what about Jim Kelly from Enter the Dragon? He's ""only"" 66. You figure you've got Chuck Norris from Return of the Dragon, which basically jump-started his career, and is 70, why not Jim Kelly?

","Expendables 2 lives up to its expectation of great action and only that with action sequences done by actors who were in their prime during the 70s and 80s and are still fighting their way to box office success (Considering the box office collection).<br/><br/>Expendables are a group of mercenaries (an army which fights for money or private gain) comprising of veteran action heroes lead by Sylvester Stallone, high on testosterone, low on IQ and the only thing they can do well is fight. The movie delivers everything what is expected of it in terms of action with mind boggling fight sequences and the climax seems like a one big party of action heroes from the 70's and the 80's. You sometimes feel that the action is there not for a reason but because the heroes just love to fight and can't do anything else. Delivering corny one-liners these Macho men are not afraid of anything, even making fun of themselves, when in one scene Stallone says to Schwarzenegger that the airplane belongs to the museum, Schwarzenegger in his usual monotone responds ""So do we"". The locales for the missions are exotic with the opening scene shot in Nepal after which they travel to Albania, Bulgaria, China. Expendables 2, with a simple plot and hard hitting action, is much more fun than the first part (at least I thought so).<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone as Barney Ross and the leader of the pack looks pretty fit for a 65 year old and I still secretly wish I can be like him, he exhibits his usual brute force and gets the job done. Jason Statham as Lee Christmas and the second in command of this team of musclemen is slick as ever and has some great action sequences all to him, in which he does not disappoint. Bruce Willis as Church (the guy who chose the Character names is one hell of a creative guy), is OK and hardly has much to do, still I guess it was obligatory to include him in this party. Dolph Lundgren as Gunner (who we all know as the Russian boxer from Rocky 4) is large and unkempt and surprisingly a feather has been added to his cap in this one by claiming he has a degree from MIT. Jet Li has a small role and is forgotten soon. Chuck Norris (the man who fought Bruce Lee at the Colosseum in The way of the Dragon)as Booker leads a lone battle against the bad guys finally decided to join the party way in the end. Jean Claude Van Damme one of the favorite martial artist hero of Hollywood plays the bad guy, looks threatening but is no match for these hungry mercenaries. Nan Yu is the lone woman and tries to match the guys but somehow she generated no interest. Terry Crews and Randy Couture complete the party and are just supportive. The surprise package in this one is Liam Hemsworth who surprisingly the youngest of the lot at 23, makes an impact as a sniper in this army.<br/><br/>Lastly, Arnold Scwarzenegger as Trench, well I don't wanna say much because I still like him and his movies, I just felt sorry for him. He has just been given sarcastic one-liners in the name of dialogue though some of them still made me laugh, like, when Bruce Willis offers him a lift in the compact smart car he remarks, ""My Shoe is bigger than this car"". But, I hope he gets better roles and I would love to watch him again.<br/><br/>I loved the movie and probably the main reason for me and all men in their midlife to like it is that after watching these old men do action, we feel there is still hope for us. It fuels the macho man inside you and makes you believe that you are young.<br/><br/>Do watch it if you are an action fan."

","When I first heard that they were following up the Expandible film from the previous one I was excited hoping for that cinematic experience that succeeded the previous film. After looking at the trailer I had my doubts and from there I really was furious. Firstly I would like to point out that it is a very good idea to have the classic action genre that we all well know. From the likes of Chuck Norris and Jean Claude Van Dam including Stallone. But really do we have to go through this again? I mean the classic action sequences we all love from the 80s and 90s should have been kept the way they were which belongs as straight to DVD. Sorry first one was good and may pass as something presentable but the second get serious. Overall I already look past the point that it is a fun film but do we have to endure the under rated succession that burnt out long ago."
"yusuzukifan","10","3","14","17 August 2012"," Best action movie in years! Minor Spoiler Alert
","I enjoyed the first Expendables, it had a few flaws, but the jokes and amazing roster of action stars made it worth seeing. The second Expendables was at least twice as good! The jokes were better, the roster was bigger, more fight scenes, better fight scenes, an insane body count. It may not have been as cut throat as Rambo 4, but with the all comedy and references they put into this film, its a must see, and should be a long standing favorite among action fans/martial arts fans. The moment that made this movie for me, was a scene in which Chuck Norris made his first appearance...CHUCK NORRIS MADE A CHUCK NORRIS JOKE! I won't say which one, but its one of the classic Norris jokes. If I have one complaint, Jet Li had a smaller role, but his time was well spent in the movie, with several great lines and one killer fight scene! 10/10, best movie of the year for me, followed by Dark Knight and Avengers,Safe, looking forward to Taken 2."

","On the whole, there was absolutely no storyline in Expendables-2, even when compared to the previous one. <br/><br/>But the rest is just Mind Blowing.

Disappointed to see no Tom & Jerry fight between Lundgren & Li.<br/><br/>I think Stephen Seagal was the only one left out from this ""Hollywood veteran tough guys group"". Liam Hemsworth has done his job perfectly, despite of his tiny role. Only God knows from where Norris comes & goes between those section scenes. Unmatchable stunts.

"Iva96","9","2","8","11 September 2012"," When we were young...
","It happens often to me to lie on the couch and watch endless rubbish on HBO or on whatever channel is on, because I'm too lazy or not in the mood to get in touch with any movie in particular. However, when I decide to view a certain movie, most frequently it happens usually because it is directed by one of my favourite directors, and I really want to see it, and make some efforts for that.<br/><br/>Exceptionally, for Expendables 2, my desire to see the movie was due to the cast - most of the heroes of my childhood and (partially) adolescence: the Lone Wolf, Terminator, Die Hard, Rambo, Universal Soldier, Transporter, to name only but a few... And to have them all together on the same stage - almost priceless!<br/><br/>My taste in movies changed over the years, but I could not have missed this one. At least for the above reason. And the movie provides it all. For 102 minutes I felt like being a young boy again. Within the first 15 minutes, I couldn't eat my popcorn, as my eyes were wide open tied to the screen. Who cares about the story, about being politically correct, about moral discussions, etc... You have the heroes in front of you, doing what they know best, and that is getting the world rid of the bad ones, in their specific manner. <br/><br/>I give this movie a rate of 9, and that is not about anything like the storyline, or the complex development of characters (which basically does not exist), but for my guilty pleasure of watching famous lines like ""I'll be back"" and the likes.<br/><br/>Plus, my girlfriend came with me to this movie basically as a favour to myself, but she had very similar feelings after it. <br/><br/>So, if you are into it, go and immerse yourself in its atmosphere!"

","The violence is so over the top as to be comical. The villains are evil and the good guys are heroic. The movie is full of corny jokes and hilarious cameos. Expendables 2 dwarfs it's predecessor on every level. I've seen people bash this movie for what it is...What were they expecting? This isn't a thoughtful tear jerker that might help you get laid. This a rock 'em, sock 'em, shoot 'em up that doesn't just glorify violence it worships it. The story line is just interesting enough to propel the viewer forward into even more precarious scenarios. No one is winning an Oscar here except for maybe Special Effects. This movie rocked musically as well with classic 60's rock tunes parsed out over the perfectly timed 1:40."

You have to know what kind of acting you're going to get.<br/><br/>As long as you go into this movie for the right reason, I strongly believe that it will no disappoint you. The fight scenes were good, the explosions were great, but most of all seeing Rambo, The Terminator, and John McClain standing three feet away from each other shooting up the bad guys was AWESOME! Then you throw in some Chuck Norris-isms and some ballet martial arts from JCVD and you've got yourself one heck of an action movie.

"Rebel_With_A_Cause_94","7","2","8","18 August 2012"," Not Great, But Much Better Than The First Film
","I personally thought the first Expendables was a huge disappointment. While The Expendables 2 is far from great, it's definitely a step up from the first one. This time around, the whole film is actually centered on all the members of The Expendables on a mission instead of focusing only one character like the first one did. The action is much better filmed this time and the action sequences are an absolute blast to watch. The film also recognizes what it is and is full of cheesy one-liners and jokes. However, a huge problem with the film is that it drags a lot in the middle and there's a period where for what feels like quite sometime there is no action in the film. I enjoyed seeing the actors all hang out and crack jokes, but after a while it grew tiresome and I wanted to see them get back to the action. What we do get in the end pays off, but this movie really did need more action than what it did deliver. Overall, The Expendables 2 still didn't quite deliver the badass action movie that I had been hoping for, but there's enough here to keep you satisfied. Lets just hope they go all out for Expendables 3."

","This movie was on my must see list and I finally saw it. This review will contain some spoilers so please beware before you start reading this review. I will keep the the spoilers as minimum as possible. Unlike the first movie, this movie, Expandables 2, starts with a bang. The movie contains much more action shots than the first one. I am sad that Mickey Rourke didn't make an appears again in this movie. The same team is back on a task that goes wrong, of course and now it's personal. I do not know was is my movie theater but the picture was a bit ""grannie"" it seemed like an old classic from the 80s. Van Damme out did himself in this movie, unlike his other action movies he did a good job acting. You can see the the boys are aging but when you start watching all that ""old classic 80s action movie"" genre that I do believe Stallone revitalized , you get hit with childhood memories and figure out how much I missed those macho action movies. The movie is filled with numerous action scenes and many entertaining lines. Chuck Norris entered the movie like only Chuck would, legendary! The whole movie in general was a blast, the dialogs were short and hilarious, reminded me of the 80s action movie dialogs. I can't wait for the Expandables 3. This is a must have collectible for anyone that loves old classic action movies. Stallone did it again! Thank you!"

Haha just kidding, but overall it had a decent story and van damme was great as the villain. Chuck Norris was great in each scene he was in but he is probably only in the movie for about 5 minutes overall, Arnold seemed a bit rusty,and overused his famous ""ill be back quote.""

","I saw The Expendables II this morning at a pr-screening. What can I tell you about this movie. Firstly, it's really action packed. You're blasted off in the first few minutes leading up to the actual story. Obviously, this is not a film with a great script or impressive acting.However, the story works well for what it's supposed to do! It is greatly entertaining if you are looking for an action packed movie loaded with iconic action stars like Stallone,Willis and many more. The addition of Chuck Norris and van Dame to the cast worked out well. It's really good to see Chuck Norris in action again and he really pulls it off! I expect that the people who will like this movie most will be the fans of the old guard like Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Norris and the other cast members. Someone I really liked was Liam Hems worth who did a great job and stood his own between these action giants! Nan as Maggie was also a good casting choice an did what she was supposed to do."

","People who feared the fact that EXPENDABLES 2 would be PG-13 need not worry, the film is actually rated-R for enough action and testosterone to satisfy even the most hard to please action fanatic, from the first frame there's a whole lot of action served up in one large dose, it reminded me of when I first saw John Woo's HARD BOILED, I thought if a film starts off with this much action at the beginning, what kind of action can we expect towards the end? Believe me this film does not disappoint, there is action throughout and like I said it comes in large doses each time.<br/><br/>There is also lots of humor, I found myself laughing at every joke and one liner that came out even Chuck Norris got the chance to tell one of his own jokes and it also shows that a smart car can be deadly in the hands of both Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/>Plot wise the film is a whole lot better, there's better character development and the whole set of characters also start to grow on you after a while and Jean-Claude Van Damme is excellent as the villain as well as Scott Adkins who plays Van Damme's right hand man.<br/><br/>Overall, action fans who have grown tired of the overly dramatic snooze fest that pass for action films these days should enjoy this action masterpiece immensely.<br/><br/>The first film on IMDb I give 10 out of 10."

The one liners are very funny as well as the movie references to Die Hard, The Terminator, and Rambo. The film definitely is a strong improvement upon the original and a great end of summer flick. Liam Hemsworth, honestly, steals the show and Van Damme makes a great villain. Willis, Stallone, Schwarzenegger, and Statham are all good in the film (not acting wise but action and humor). Chuck Noris provides comedy relief of an almost self parody of himself. Is this a film that's gonna take home Best Picture at the Oscars next year? Absolutely Not!!!

"donaldsensing","8","2","9","18 August 2012"," Expendables 2 - Utterly brainless, but you knew that
","(A very minor spoiler in the third and 4th paragraphs)<br/><br/>Is it possible to make a movie that makes less sense and has more plot holes than Sylvester Stallone's 2010 hit, The Expendables? Why, yes, yes it is. And what else could that be but its sequel, The Expendables 2? <br/><br/>The most entertaining thing about TE2 is the screenplay's gentle self mockery of the actors' established on screen characters. In fact, absent this the movie would be boring despite the millions of bullets fired.<br/><br/>TE2 has more movie action heroes than its predecessor, including, for example, Chuck Norris, who, after single-handedly annihilating an entire Albanian armored regiment (I exaggerate a little) has this conversation with Rocky Balboa or Rambo, or whomever Stallone is playing this time:<br/><br/>Stallone: I thought you were dead. I heard that you got bitten by a King Cobra.<br/><br/>Norris: Yes, I was bitten by a King Cobra. After five days of enduring excruciating agony, the cobra died.<br/><br/>This is not a new joke on the long list of Chuck Norris tough guy jokes that have been going around for years. I have heard it before, but the placement and delivery in TE2 is too good not to laugh.<br/><br/>Other such lines without context, and won't need to identify the speaker:<br/><br/>""I'm back.""<br/><br/>""I'll be back.""<br/><br/>""Yippee yo kai-a.""<br/><br/>The movie has no story line to speak of, is not the slightest concerned about the gaping gaps in the narrative or the technical impossibilities of most of the stunts. So what? This movie does one thing: create cinematic opportunities for as much gunfire and mayhem as possible. Don't worry that the Expendables never miss and the baddies never hit. The action is so over the top that its unreality and impossibility become part of the fun. Even so, TE2 is less splattery than the first, and that is all to the good, too.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the good guys win in the end and all survive intact. Then they fly off to await their next adventure. The tagline: After seeing his newly-acquired but ancient airplane to replace the one he crashed, Stallone exclaims, ""It's a museum piece!""<br/><br/>And Arnold answers, ""We all are.""<br/><br/>Overall, I give The Expendables 2 7.5 out of 10 Rambos."
"rgkarim","Null","2","9","17 August 2012"," Surprisingly Good Sequel, Though Still Needs Some Actor Balance Work
","It seems not long ago that testosterone the movie, I mean Guy Flick, I mean the Expendables came out. This action packed, adrenaline pumping, gun shooting, etc. adventure was the most popular movie among guys. Yes, all of the greatest action stars came together to make that movie, though Sylvester Stallone hogged most of the screen time and did most of the work. So when I saw the sequel's trailer months ago I was a little excited, though worried that this movie would be mainly another glorification to the aging actor. Were my fears and concerns justified or did the movie actually do what it was supposed to do this time. Read on to find out.<br/><br/>Let's face it, with this many action stars there is going to be very little story in this movie. The motif for all the killing in this film is essentially revenge and nothing more, so those looking for one should stay home. To my surprise however, the film did add a little more background to the team in this film (though not much) to give them additional features to help them stand out. Most people who go see this movie though probably don't care about character development so long as they get the action they are promised. Well my friends, Expendables 2 has plenty of action throughout the movie that will make guys pump their fists in victory, well in parts that is. Though I haven't seen the first film in a while, I believe this sequel has more breaks in the action than its predecessor. After an amazing opening fight, where the team has the accuracy FPS gamers can only dream of, the team shifts gears into a nice hike/plane ride. Although a few skirmishes happen here and there, the action doesn't pick back up until the end in an explosive shower of guns. Despite the slow pace and attempt at story, the first and last battles have more than enough action to keep you stoked for a couple of weeks. You may wonder if the action or violence has been cut down because of the PG-13 rating. Relax my friends; you have nothing to worry about as there are plenty of exploding heads, blood, and awesome take downs in this movie. The only thing the PG-13 movie took away was the overuse of the F word, nudity, and a lack of corny sexual innuendos that we've been hit over the head with this summer, which is such a shame (sarcasm). <br/><br/>With the action living up to par, the next thing to address is the balance of stars in this movie. Unfortunately despite the two years they have had to improve, the movie still focuses on Stallone's character as he again has most of the screen time. The first battle had all the squad members doing something cool to complete the mission and show off their impressive skills. Past that though, the directors decided to scrap two of the characters and replace them with Stallone's mug just frowning. Fans of Jet Li and Liam Hemsworth will need to soak up their parts at the beginning, because they soon leave the movie to make room for the newbies of the film. Jason Statham fans, however, will be thrilled to see English star continue to kick butt. The rest of the rag tag crew have some decent scenes, a lot better than the first one, but they still don't hold a candle to Stallone's face time. I even began to fear that Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Chuck Norris were going to get the shaft. Luckily the ending battle prevents the audience from getting cheated out of its money, well mostly that is. As for Jean-Claude Van Damme , he is really only good for a couple of spin kicks and some unemotional acting, which is a shame. <br/><br/>What else can I say about this film? One enjoyable thing to mention is the numerous references to the stars' other movies. The Expendables' banter loves to use well timed, often over exaggerated, quotes from films like Terminator, Die Hard, or Rambo. Yes I did laugh at these lines, but some of them had me rolling my eyes after the third for fourth time. If you pay attention you may find other references to movies in this film, one of which should remind you of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The dialogue is also full of puns that may have you chuckling if you are in the mood, especially the heads up line. Another aspect I'm proud to announce is that for an action movie the camera work is rather stable. What does this mean to an action lover? It means you get all the messy details the action team wanted you to see. That's right it means instead of getting camera work that looks like it was filmed during an earthquake, Expendables 2's camera men managed to find ways to keep the camera stable and smooth. Combined with some good editing and some close ups of our heroes, the film crew achieved their goal of adventure, though I wonder if they asked Michael Bay for some their explosive. <br/><br/>Overall Expendables 2 is a decent sequel, but the team still has work to do for the third movie that is probably on its way. In particular I would like to see more of the other action stars than Stallone; otherwise they should just name the movie Rambo 5 and call it a day. Is it worth a trip to the movies? This action lover says yes as the surround sound, big screen experience makes the adventure come to life even more. However, if you would rather skip this flick because of what it lacks, rent it on Netflix at least. The scores for this film are the following: Action/Adventure: 8.0-8.5 Movie Overall: 7.0"

I wanted to like Expendables 2, but it doesn't work.<br/><br/>Maybe it was it too hard to ask the stars of this film to take it seriously. They didn't and it shows on the screen. The opening sequence depicts an incredible set of action scenes, each one more glorious and deadly than the last. But you wouldn't know it by the dialog. It seems like the superstar actors are having fun on the set, not like they are in a war zone. Sometimes they utter one of their trademark one-liners to make fun of their on-screen personas. Those are good for a quick laugh, but they're bad for the movie. <br/><br/>I never like it when I hear that my favorite action movies are pointlessly violent, but that's the way I feel about Expendables 2.Take the top three movies of any one of the successful action stars in this movie, and Expendables 2 doesn't come close to any of them."

I used to refer to films of this nature as BSMs, but the reference to Ms. Brown's classic hit is just too good to resist, and ""The Expendables 2"" is as fine an example of the genre to start with as anyone could ask.<br/><br/>The boys are back in town, and more cartoonishly than ever. Stallone, Statham, Lundgren, Couture, Crews, and Li (briefly) are all back from the franchise opener, along with Willis and Schwarzenegger, along with the added seasoning of Liam ""The Hunger Games"" Hemsworth and newcomer (to most Americans) Nan ""Speed Racer' Yu, providing some welcome ass- kicking estrogen, and the fading icons Jean-Claude ""Bloodsport"" Van Damme and Chuck ""Deus ex"" Norris. They all deliver the goofy goods with gusto and galloping gallantry, almost making one overlook the absurd script, atrocious dialog and impossible physics. Shelly ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" Johnson's camera-work is fine and dandy, as is Simon ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" West's direction, thankfully keeping the action discernible; I look forward to their rendition of next year's ""Heat"" (no relation to the 1995 Michael Mann classic heist film).<br/><br/>No more need be said.

","I feel that if I were to write a lengthy review, I would have wasted more time on this movie franchise so I am going to keep it as brief as possible. Without giving much away, I just want to help steer clear the guys who are on the fence about wanting to watch this movie and may be looking for a good movie plot.<br/><br/>Although the plot and script are better than the first movie and the lines seem to be a lot less cheesy, it still suffers from the really bad introduction of cameos. It's as if every time they are cornered in the plot, along comes another cameo to pull them out of the ditch. This is one of the reasons although better than the first movie, still a bad script. There needs to be a better build up to events in the plot. Although having said that, the plot is more gripping than the first movie (if only a little).<br/><br/>Questions I need to ask (maybe I missed this from finding it hard to stay awake):<br/><br/>1. Just like in the first movie, if Willis' crew are so tough that they were going to punish Stallone's crew for failing, why not just do the missions themselves? <br/><br/>2. Why would he take on the worst baddies fearlessly and fear the wrath of Willis' crew? <br/><br/>3. Why did Chuck Norris have this giddy little smile throughout his cameo appearance that said he was there to bake muffins rather than be the so-called-lone-wolf?<br/><br/>Plus many more questions I can't be bothered to list."

A movie with Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Bruce Willis and Chuck Norris doesn't need a good story at all, it can't be bad, but however this movie actually had a good story so it's more than good, it's amazing. I love the fact that they actually mentioned some Chuck Norris facts and I also loved it when he made his first appearance, he took out A LOT of guys and a tank all by himself, that's like the Chuck Norris facts in action.

","I loved it. I absolutely loved this movie, which was both funnier and better plotted than the first. The little digs the characters make at each other are hilarious and make the movie for me - where else do you see all the ""old"" stars of Hollywood take cracks at each other like that? It breaks the movie up from something serious, sombre and sad, to something that has surprising moments of laugh-out-loud humour and nearly childish delight. Some movies break up the shooting (be warned - the sound of shooting never ends in this movie) with girls and sex, but The Expendables does it with laughs and petty jabs, and it fits perfectly with the older actors.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone and Statham seem to play the same characters in every single movie they're in, but in this, they fit perfectly. Hell, all the actors are so clich√©d that they're perfect for the roles, and they're also able to do the serious stuff with decency. I am a huge Jet Li fan, and was sad that he was only briefly in it, but I was also actually quite surprised by the appearance of Chuck Norris - I read nothing about the movie before watching it - I didn't want to ruin it.<br/><br/>I cannot wait until 3 comes out - I'll be seeing it at the cinema for sure - who could pass up seeing Jackie Chan on the big screen?<br/><br/>So, because I watched the entire thing and it passed my expectations magnificently (and I was expecting it to be half decent), had a hearty laugh every half an hour, and because it was better written and seemed to be going somewhere (and even promising a sequel!), I gave it 9 stars. It's not something that will go down in history, but it's going on my ""Personal Favourites"" list, that's for sure."

","Anyone else remember the action awesomeness of the 80's and 90's? I really miss it. Nothing but thin story line and gratuitous violence. <br/><br/>This movie brought it back real well. <br/><br/>Have to say, Bruce Willis, and Chuck Norris look very good for their age. Little older but not much else. Jason Statham is handsome as ever and capable of some really amazing martial arts and knife play (didn't realize he could move that fast). Office didn't age Arnold Swartzenegger very well, and Stallone is definitely looking his age. Lundgren... well I never thought he was the greatest looking man but they really did a lot to make him look bad. <br/><br/>Too bad there wasn't more butt kicking from Jet Li. <br/><br/>That being said, I don't care what anyone says, those muscles are still rippling, and still awesome to watch. Couple these fantastic action stars with a cheesy script and amazing FX and you have one fun movie. It is wonderful to see some of the best action stars of the last 30 years all in one movie, and still kicking as much butt as they did years ago.<br/><br/>Loved the one liners, and the Chuck Norris jokes (told by him, no less). <br/><br/>Do it again."

","This film is reaching for some type of nostalgia that most of us won't understand. THe problem is I definitely understand,.. I grew up in the 80's, but this movie is still WAY over-rated on here at 7.1.<br/><br/>There's loads of carnage, carnage, action, and nostalgia here. All of these guys have been there and done that, no doubt. <br/><br/>Most of the lines give homage to movies from these actors' past. THe problem is that most of these lines aren't clever at all, and the actors literally threw in the towel as if this was some spoof, or like they didn't care. The whole film felt like some sort of joke, you know, like Universal Soldier 2.<br/><br/>It's pretty bad. Can't we go to some roast in a year or two and see this.<br/><br/>I'm supposed to know there's no plot. I DO! I DID! I was alright with knowing that going in. All that said, this is a really poor flick with some good action in the first 30 minutes.<br/><br/>The writing is deplorable. The acting worse. And when I say no plot, I mean that in the absolute strongest sense of the phrase.<br/><br/>We have one character here that we care one iota about, and he's killed in the first third of the film, in the film's best scene. From there on, this film sets all-time new low standards in nearly every department. No amount of carnage can make up for the rest of this film.<br/><br/>The worst part is that I CAN like these types of films. Check out these similar action-packed ratings of mine to put this score into perspective: Safe 6/10 Lock Up 5.5/10 Battleship 6/10 The Raid 7.5/10 Act of Valor 5/10 IP Man 2 9/10 Fast Five 7/10 Die Hard 9/10 Rambo:First Blood Part 2 7/10 Set-Up 3/10 Blitz 5/10<br/><br/>I hope that puts my 4/10 rating in perspective.<br/><br/>You MIGHT like this(and I stress might) if you liked: Fast Five(better), Universal Soldier(better), Commando(better), A-Team(a little better), or Expendables(equally as disappointing).<br/><br/>Hopefully this film falls way below that 7.0 mark after it gets some netflix/redbox play, because this current score is like leading the audience to the slaughterhouse. Sub-par, even for the genre.<br/><br/>You want an example of an effective action packed flick with better performances, while being more entertaining in every way.. try ""Rundown 6.5/10""<br/><br/>43/100"

","Like the last movie the sequel is a bang-up job as well. The action scenes didn't look the part with saggy grandpas, the comedy didn't work either with forcible positioned dialogues. <br/><br/>The first time it was understandable, everyone wants another go.

But lets be clear, the last movie had tainted the good work they had done 20 or so years ago.<br/><br/>I had hoped they would stop then, but I am guessing the money is too good. Surely there are millions of others like me who would go to the theaters again to watch their childhood heroes again. It makes marketing sense (and only that) to make another installment. <br/><br/>And they have got Van-Damme and Chuck Norris for this rubbish! Van-Damme is pathetic as a villain, and with Chuck Norris they do not even make that attempt at his past glory.

","Link between the two parts was good, but the letdown was the inappropriate dialogs which looked foolish sometimes. The story now revolves around a new job assigned to the team. Things get complex and finally they are bound to kill. The film surely displays muscles nicely but in many things it didn't had the charm present in the previous film.<br/><br/>PROS: <br/><br/>Has action, and a few Stathom knife fights, which I always cherish. The continuation of the story is good but nothing was properly developed via the script.<br/><br/>CONS: <br/><br/>What looked bad in the film was that the action scenes were all the same as the previous one, and the new ones especially by Arnold sucked. If someone would ask who was best and the worst among the cast, then Stathom with his Knife action is again the best. However the worst will have a good competition between Arnold and Chuck Norris. Both had poor dialogs, delivery too also bad. The second part of the film was very fast. The major fight is only in the last 15 minutes. The story was OK but I didn't like the script, the way they handled the events. Most of the other cast didn't have much screen time. The Villain- 'Van Damn' could not impress too much, again due to less attention given to him.<br/><br/>VERDICT: ""Only for action freaks."""

This time they took a different approach, there are just so many bad guys randomly appearing, you never even feel like there is something violent happening.

"ZChrisJ1995","6","1","3","27 September 2012"," Delivers exactly what you expect - a big dumb action movie
","What I love about this film is that it offers no pretenses or attempts to be something that it's not. The Expendables 2 is a big dumb action movie - exactly what its audience wants. <br/><br/>After the events of the first film, Barney Ross and his band of mercenaries are once again called into action, this time to retrieve a top-secret device from a military plane that was shot down in Albania. Unfortunately this plan goes awry and one of their own is killed. The Expendables then must pool their resources and skills together once again in order to combat their new nemesis, Jean Villain, played by the Muscles from Brussels himself, Jean-Claude Van Damme. <br/><br/>I enjoyed that in this film The Expendables were motivated to act by revenge as opposed to money, as in the first film, as this makes their mission much more sincere and personal. Likewise the humour in this film is cranked up a notch, both physical and verbal, a highlight being Dolph Lundgren's Gunnar Jensen delivery of many pathetic attempts at seduction to Yu Nan's Maggie Chan, to the audience's amusement. <br/><br/>Whilst much humour can be found in the film, there are many flaws with the script, ensuring countless cringe-worthy moments, for example the consistent use of Chuck Norris jokes in relation to his character Booker. Likewise, I found myself awkwardly shifting in my seat during the scene in which the mercenaries recount what they wish their last meal to be, with Maggie Chan describing a traditional Chinese dish as ""sexy"". <br/><br/>It's a welcome sight to see so many action movie icons condensed into one film, although some, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Chuck Norris, are not given enough screen time, and seem to be randomly thrown into the movie as deux ex machinas. Nevertheless, it still is a wondrous sight to witness Schwarzenegger, Norris and Bruce Willis standing side by side, mowing down rows of bad guys with automatic weapons. <br/><br/>As can be gathered, the action (and violence) is extraordinary, with bombings, airplane crashes, knifings, shootings, decapitations and neck-snappings filling up the screen from start to finish in its infinite goriness. The Expendables 2 really isn't a film for the faint-hearted. <br/><br/>Whilst the script and some of the characters need some obvious refinement, this is expected. It shouldn't come as a surprise that The Expendables 2 isn't nominated for a Best Original Screenplay award. Rather, it fills this void with a plethora of classic action stars and stunning, testosterone-fuelled action in a tribute to the action genre and its place in the 1980's. This is exactly what its audience (and I myself) wanted and expected when watching this film, nothing more, nothing less. <br/><br/>6/10."

","One word-Amazing,this was only the word coming out of my mouth while watching this flick. Reading reviews of poor story-line and weak acting had me discouraged to enjoy this amazing movie but once you start watching this movie none of those things come to mind.The movie starts involving an infiltration into the jungles of Albania to rescue a secret something (a MacGuffin) from a downed airplane. Things don't go as expected. Ross and his team lose not only the MacGuffin but also one of their own. Tearfully, they vow revenge. The team tracks the bad guys in Russia, where apparently a lot of uranium exists. The bad guys, led by Van Damme, plan to get all of the unguarded uranium and either hold the world hostage or destroy it. This movie is'n't for the critical thinkers or science graduates but for those who like to have a good time. So just go watch this movie!"

","To sum up my experience with the movies I & II, I had no clue about I but for that I am a knife collector, and saw the knife in a catalog, then I looked up the movie. I was floored by the cast, and by that time, they were making this one, II. I waited in great expectation, and was even more floored by the cast. Every icon of action of my generation, it is unreal. <br/><br/>There's an up and a down, of course. Every hero (or anti-hero) has his lines, but there is no STAR. Which is perfect, and intentional. Every nuance of the movie is a serious back-take to the roles that were, yet set in a fun ""let's have a beer and watch"" setting. <br/><br/>There are no lines to be saved from this one, just very good chuckles at the cross-reference lines they make to each other both in and out of character. (As in, to each other's actor's previous movies).<br/><br/>It's not filmed as nicely or cohesively as the previous I movie, but the special effects certainly were what was wanted by this audience. CGI or not, but I suppose that's really what shooting people really looks like. I imagine somebody next will say, ""It will better in III if they have zombies!""<br/><br/>All and all, I'd rate this as not a classic, but a cult classic to be, along the lines of Highlander and The Crow. To compare it to a TV show, it would have to be a classic, because of the cast that you're ""used to"", like MASH or Star Trek.<br/><br/>I rated it a 7 for it's filming/continuity. I'd really give it an 8 if your a fan of the genre, and a 9 if your a geek like me."

","As a movie I like the first one better . However, I am a huge fan of 1980's action movies and with the combined cast of Ex2 I own about 100 movies in my personal collection . The positive aspects of Ex2 is the expanded roles for Arnold and Willis, the Chuck Norris cameo, plus JCVD as a villain and Scott Adkins as the heavy. Van Damme's performance was so good , it is my favorite aspect of the film. Also, having everyone here in the same film is an action fan's wet dream. What I didn't like was the tone. The first film was darker and if there was anymore comedy , this tough as nails franchise turns into a slapstick comedy . In action movies a lot of this stuff is tongue in cheek , here it is a touch much. Yes, there are bigger action scenes. But there was better action in Ex1 and some of the action here is downright stupid. Not to mention the lack of Jet Li and turning Gunnar,the loose cannon psychopath into a circus clown .

","Maybe I will repeat most of what have already said the other users.<br/><br/>So, I prefer this one rather the first movie, two years ago. Jean Claude Van Damme plays here the second villain character of his whole carrier, as far as I know. Remember BLACK EAGLE, back in 1988. Here, he gives a wonderful performance, exquisite at the most. The final fight against Stallone is terrific. <br/><br/>I like this movie for Van Damme's character and also because after all these nearly thirty years, we at last see those eighties - and also nineties - action heroes play together: Stallone, Norris, Willis, Van Damme, Schwarzenegger. With some more recent actors such as Statham and Jet Li. Those guys have NEVER played in a single film, even for at least two of them. Never, as far as I know, and I don't guess mistaking. Except Van Damme and Lundgren in UNIVERSAL SOLDIER, back in 92. <br/><br/>But this feature remains a second rate action flick. I prefer James Bond ones, nothing to compare. Explosions and pyrotechnics are and remain artificial and superficial. That not makes a good film. <br/><br/>And I also liked the scene between Schwarzy and Willis in the little vehicle, when Willis argues with his mates about his ""I'll be back"" famous sentence - Remember Terminator; and when Arnold says to Willis his also famous saying ""Yuppie Kaiye"". Remember DIE HARD movies...<br/><br/>Yes, it is a fairly good amusement movie, especially for old eighties fans as I am."

Shooting up from a downwards angle, Stallone's tucked up eyebags make him look Asian. VanDamme really needed to keep his sunglasses on to hide a face that looks like Joan Rivers in the morning. And like most movies centered around the action, the thin plot exists just to string the over-the-top action scenes together. These guys shoot more automatic fire than all the A-Team episodes combined, with only slightly better results. If you want to see action done the right way, watch any of the Daniel Craig James Bond movies, not this overblown nightmare. And the dialog?

Rourke's absence creates a void, though his character didn't do much in the first movie anyway‚Äîhis uselessness is actually substituted with Chuck Norris' couple walk-on cameos that add nothing to the story; and Li annoyingly gets third billing again despite his character being drastically smaller than in the first film. It's nice to see Schwarzenegger and Willis' characters expanded though. Jean-Claude Van Damme joins the cast as the main antagonist; however, a guy like him should have been a way better bad guy than Eric Roberts was. The first film was refreshing because it didn't fall into the trap of corny lines, and the setting was original and interesting; unfortunately, this film does not have the same quality. The climax is especially lame. No sign of Giselle Iti√©; instead, we are introduced to Yu Nan, who briskly shoves herself into the movie like a token Bond girl.

There is no scope for acting as the camera keeps on zooming in on one face after the other as if the director had to show the emotions of the whole freaking team whenever any bullshit has to be discussed. The action scenes are gripping and partially save the day for the movie. The fight between Stallone and Van Damme is choreographed brilliantly. Maybe this was meant as a tribute to the 80s action movies which had no story and just a bunch of guys blowing up the despots and saving the world. If it is a homage then it works very well because that is the story here too. A waste of time and an affront to the fans of action movies.

This is 21st century and I am sitting in an Empire cinema in one of London's suburbs and the damn chair is held together by duct tape so that it doesn't fall apart. Then there is picture quality. You know what, I challenge you to download a pirated version of that movie with picture quality as terrible as that. What the hell is Empire doing, saving on projector bulbs? If that is the case, why would I not simply download a pirated version of the movie, sit at home in comfort of my sofa and save myself price of the ticket. Empire - you should be ashamed of yourself!!!<br/><br/>Now the movie ... I was not looking forward to it as sequel hardly ever lives up to all expectation but this one did. It was just great to see them all in one place. Chuck was just incredible and I wish that Dolph Lundgren had longer appearance. Jokes were funny and spot on and to see Arnie back in action was just awesome. I am so glad that now that he is out of politics we will see more and more of him. One actor I would love to have seen is Steven Seagal but he is not on talking terms with Van Damme so I guess no can do. To me Jason stole the show. Fighting scenes were just superb, I loved it! Excellent movie, shame about disgraceful viewing experience. Bring on the third one !!! ( I will download this one )"

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>After a successful mission in Nepal where Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger) was rescued, Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and his team of 'expendables' are celebrating a job well done. Until his old love/hate friend Church (Bruce Willis) tracks him down and offers him a job in exchange of avoiding prison: travel to China and retrieve a suitcase containing nuclear launch codes. The mission goes well, until him and his men find themselves accosted by Jean Villain (Jean Claude Van Damme) and his team of mercenaries, and one of their men is killed. Gunning for revenge, the group learn the villains are heading to Russia, where the suitcase contains the go codes for some buried plutonium.<br/><br/>The original Expendables film had unlimited box office potential in a number of ways. It set itself up very unpretentiously, a simple, no brainer, big budget action flick where head honcho Sly reunited all his old action buddies from the 80s/90s, and delivered a load of what the fan base had come to expect and demand, with some self depreciation par for the course. While I was left a bit underwhelmed by it, it certainly worked wonders at the box office and gave some long forgotten stars another big taste of the big screen again (even if it didn't quite re- ignite their careers there.) So, of course, a sequel has come along, albeit with new director Simon West (which naturally gives it a less of a feeling of being an ego trip) and extended screen time for giants of the genre Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/>The action delivers as thick and fast as you'd imagine, but it's all slightly too noisy, harshly filmed, lumbering and unsubtle, bigger and badder than the old days but not better. The script tries it's hardest at decent dialogue, but it really comes to life with the obvious but admittently rib tickling in jokes and self sending up (to wit, at the end, Arnie telling Bruce he'll 'be back', only to be told he's 'been back once too often, let me be back for once.' His answer? 'Yippee Key Eh'), which adds to the welcome feeling of it all not taking itself too seriously. The best thing about it is actually Van Damme as the villain, surprisingly charismatic and convincingly sadistic, while new comer Scott Adkins also displays some un nerving presence as his henchman. Unbelievably (and certainly sadly) the worst thing about it emerges as Chuck Norris, not on his part but at the way his character ridiculously emerges out of nowhere while all the action's going. His presence here just feels like an unsuccessful send up of his Lone Wolf McQuade character, and it doesn't work.<br/><br/>West's style and delivery make this emerge as more of a success than the undelivering original, and while it's still not the action masterpiece I wanted it to be, it's still a fair bit above bog standard. ***"

","I am not going to lie this movie was amazing to watch but i just wish that the writers of this movie made it more seriously. I know people wanted to see the comedy along with the action but i think they should have made less jokes and more action. The part where Arnold said ill be back, from the classic terminator and when he said the Bruce Wills die hard line ""yippe kiyay"", it just made me realize this was a movie. When you watch a good movie you should be so distracted by the movie that you think its real, This movie just lacked seriousness and acting.

Expendables 2 has just about all the great action stars of the past with lots of fighting, cheesy dialogue sprinkled with some humor, and it doesn't take itself too seriously. A deep philosophical flick this is not, but anyone considering see it should already be aware of this. I'm sure there will be the bad reviews decrying the end of civilization that people will actually see and enjoy this type of movie with all the real problems out in the world, but who cares, this is a nice couple of hours of escapism fun. Stallone, Statham, Van Damme, Wills, Arnold, Chuck Norris and others manage to pull off an exciting thrill ride that anyone who was a fan of their past movies should appreciate.<br/><br/>This movie definitely warrants the R rating.

","Went to go watch this with the family and was not disappointed. You don't have to watch the first one because there really is no linear storyline between the first and second movie. *SPOILERS AHEAD* Relatively new actor Liam Hemsworth is really good with the little time he has in the flick. It was a real surprise to me when he died, and was genuinely sad in that moment. Chuck Norris is also hilarious in the few minutes he is in the film. If you like big explosions, this is the movie for you. The movie also gave me a nostalgic feel seeing a lot of the actors I and my parents grew up with. The story is fine. I kinda hoped that Jet Li would get more screen time, but overall it was what the trailers advertise, an old fashioned no holds barred firefight of a movie."
"martinrobertson300482","6","1","5","7 September 2012"," Slightly better
","The original ""Expendables"" was meh. And this follow-up is even more so. The Trouble with these movies is that what they promise is all down too a few scenes. The scenes where all the 80's stars we want to see together are in fact together, are exactly what we expect them too be this time round. But the rest off the movie has trouble living up too these moments.<br/><br/>This sequel is more in the right direction, and gave me what I expected (but wasn't really given) from the original. It is cool too see Sylvester Stallone share the screen with the likes off Dolph Lundgren and Jet Lee. But way more cool when he's up against Jean Claude Van Damne as a bad-guy, or Chuck Norris (In the films second best scene) as a new super hard allie. The Cool factor almost goes through the roof though when we see Stallone share the screen in a huge airport shoot-out alongside none other than Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. This scene alone makes the movie seriously memorable too anyone who ever watched an 80's/90's action movie.<br/><br/>These moments aside though its a pretty standard fare. The action sequences are way over the top, and the funny/cheesy one liners will hit as often as they miss. The Script and the story have been improved. But judging by the first flicks standards, that wouldn't off been too difficult too pull off."

I didn't find anything to dislike, it was the coming together of iconic action stars and seeing them in one big movie is simply worth it in itself. It was heavy with explosions and action scenes sprinkled with humor coming from banter between the stars. Popular action movie quotes were sporadic throughout the movie and there was one scene that played with them humorously.

What is the use of Arnold, Willis when you have to use them for 5 minute of total bombshell crap? Expendables 2 starts promisingly, the excitement is back as the team go on full Rampage to save a Chinese someone that doesn't mattered for the rest of the movie. Big combat trucks are thrown at us and Lee (Statham) is taking shots from his machine gun as we remember in Rambo 4, full bloody hell. They save Chinese and also Arnold, who was trapped there. Bill the Kid (Hemsworth), a very sharp Sniper is introduced then who helps the Expendables escaping a giant water rush after saving the Chinese. And from here they are in there usual plane with Barney as t heir pilot, Jet Lee is gone after an initial burst and never returns in the movie. So his fans don't go for the movie. Church comes into picture, yes Mr. Willis looks good on screen but there is nothing he is supposed to be doing in this movie. Expendables have a new assignment and they are screwed, Bill gets killed, Barney is back in his emotional revenge mood. Lee gets someone to screw like Steve Austin in 1st part. Maggie, yes we have a female character too, who doesn't impress you. Boom bang next. Yes it was worth a wait I would say as the full team go on hunting the bad guys. This movie is not a modern day tech war James bond movie with lot of gadgets and all. It's an old school movie of bullets and knives and combat skills and tanks and choppers and blood. Don't go looking for a plot, forget story and enjoy all these big heavyweights together fighting, who knows till when we are seeing them as they rightly said in last ""We three should be in museum""."

","in this sequel of 2010 hit box office ""The Expendable"" Stallone has managed to gather all of 80's and 90's famous action star in order to make his action extravagance bigger and better.the action movie is indeed bigger and way more louder than the previous movie with raining of gun blazing thousand of bullets and a large amount of explosive.with an entourage of 80's action hero,this testosterone driven action movie is kind of a detour of some of the most fun and entertaining action movie back in late 80's and early 90's. Watching both Willis and Schwarzeneger argued about their comeback in the movie is fun and also with Norris brief appearance as the Lone Wolf Booker fired up a bazooka is also exciting.unfortunately,these kind of reunion is ""The Expendable 2"" all about. the movie itself is kind of a rehash from the 80's and 90's action movie.it is an action movie that tries to become something fresh by combining the old and the new formula of action movie that include the action stars.despite the effort,the movie is failed in term of bringing its promise,instead its becoming a kind of dull and mindless action movie. <br/><br/>The story is centered on the group of mercenary lead by its charismatic leader Barney Ross and his second in command Lee Christmas.after their successful mission in liberating a country in south America from an evil dictator.the group were given another mission from Mr.Church that it seems like an ordinary simple dirty job given by Church with a decent pay.Church also introduced a new recruit to the team name Maggie,a tech specialist with military training to the team.after the introduction,they began their new mission given by Church.suddenly the unthinkable happened when they were ambushed and then being taken hostage by another group of mercenary.the ambush ended up killing their new recruit named Billy The Kid,a young kid that joined the expendables after he got out from the military.in the aftermath of this event,Barney and his expendables made a promise to take revenge on the man who had killed Billy The Kid. <br/><br/>The classic theme of vengeance and ruthless main villain is the main plot of the movie which is pretty much sum up the 80's style of action genre.while the use of big gun and stylish fighting scene are borrowed from modern action movie.though,its combination didn't bring something new.at one point,there is a feeling of excitement as each of the action hero get back to their roots especially Sly who has managed to do all the action by himself.another surprise that this movie has is the brief appearance of Chuck Norris who eventually come out more than just an ordinary cameo when he appeared in the last battle scene.beside Norris,it is the return of Jean-Claude Van Damme as the main villain that really make the movie become intriguing to watch.his unique accent and high kicks in the final battle really brings out the memories of watching his movie such as ""Universal Soldier""(1992).This sequel could be worst without his appearance as the main villain.<br/><br/>although the rest of the movie is basically like any other modern action movie that borrow many reference from another typical of action movie such as ""Takers""(2010) where director Simon West decide to focus on develop each character personality that eventually lead to style of action instead the dept of its character.though,The Expendable is better than Takers because it still has a drama,unlike Takers where the character action is driven only by selfish needs that eventually led up to a story where stupid and obnoxious people trapped in the struggle because of their own ego.fortunately,Sly and West are still concerned about the drama and morality of the story even though there is only several scene that truly depict that kind of morality.despite all the mind blowing and over-exaggerate special effects,the characters still have capabilities to connect to the audience with a few punchline of typical humor that simple but effective at the same time.all of the humor is naturally flow in each conversation among the mercenary,even Lundgren could be funny at some occasion.<br/><br/>having these kind of humor is one of the reason that makes this sequel is fun to watch,especially for entertainment.but for those who expect great action movie where there was many twist and unpredictability,""The Expandable 2"" is far from that region.instead,the movie is aimed toward the people who loves 80's action movie with its clique.especially for those who love an action movie that is driven by suspense and violent,look no further than this group of old action hero."

"virindra","7","1","5","19 August 2012"," Breathtaking.
","As a young boy I loved the movies of Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Willis and so on. So a movie like this is a dream. Action was great, fighting scenes were breathtaking. I am glad I came out of the cinema alive. Stallone is still great. My wife came with me to see the movie in cinema and asked me why these old men still make movies. Well, I don't know, but I'm glad they do.<br/><br/>Gunnar (Dolph Lundgren) was funny. Because of him the movie was watchable for the female audience. Li, where the hell was he? Stratham was awesome. Willis and Schwarzenegger were funny, but what happened with Scharzenegger's hair dress? Did his hair explode too? I did not like Liam Hemsworth in the movie. In the beginning he was O.K. but then sudden he had this story about his dog or something and it got very boring. I don't know if it's because his acting or because of the lame story of maybe the chemistry between the lame acting and boring story, but it didn't work out well. I know this could have been better and if it was better, you would get more attached to this boy as a viewer. Jean Claude was great. Norris was good, I did not expect this of him, but he was good. Not good enough to watch all his movie he made that I haven't seen. He wasn't that good enough.<br/><br/>The movie had great one-liners. At the end the actors came on screen and for a moment you get to see their skulls. That was very beautiful!<br/><br/>Now there are rumors about a third movie, and there should be a third movie. Now there are also rumors to have Steven Segal attached to it. Oh please don't! Except when he is going to play the role of a pony-tailed woman who gets kidnapped and has to be saved by the men who really do have muscles. Making expendables was a good idea, making expendables 2 was even greater. Don't waste it on Segal in the third. If I may suggest someone who I would like to see, more than Segal, I would prefer Jean Reno (Leon 1994)."

","***Please be advised, this review does contain Spoilers!!***<br/><br/>So, the ""Expendables 2"" .... let me start by saying it isn't the first one by any means. If you are looking for a throw-back to hard-core, violent, over-the-top, ridiculously unbelievable mindless action, you'll definitely get it with ""E2"". BUT, here lies the the one big flaw in my opinion- some major characters are deeply underutilized. The great thing about Eric Robert's villain in ""E1"" is that you love to hate him. He is the epitome of bad-ass- he is slick, crude, bloodthirsty, and totally cool all at the same time. And he did this all without breaking a sweat. Van Damme spends the better part of the movie wearing black shades, driving around in a truck and looking bored. When we finally get to see what Van Damme does best, kickboxing, we get two roundhouse kicks and we're done. And don't get me started on the fact the one female team member gets a 2-second fight scene. Can we get Gina Carano for the next one?! I went into this one expecting full 80's action hero overload- I wanted to feel like my head would explode from all of that old-school testosterone on the screen. While I did ultimately get it, it came extremely late, and not until the climax of the movie. <br/><br/>If you are a true fan of some of these actors, expect to be disappointed when you either only see them for 10 minutes of the movie, OR, their characters do not live up to their full potential. I feel like I was lied to in order to get me in a seat, and the truth is, I would of purchased a ticket even if half of these guys were in it. Maybe this has something to do with Stallone not directing this time, or maybe it was simply the side effect of trying to give the fans more than a movie with a run time of 1 hour and 42 minutes could handle. Perhaps the powers-that-be behind the rumored ""E3"" can benefit from watching ""The Avengers"" a bit closer if they plan to balance their star power a little better next time around. Don't get me wrong, I loved the action and the witty banter, but it wasn't enough to make this a fully formidable follow-up to a movie which returned us to the glory of the old days!! <br/><br/>Of special mention is a hilarious exchange between Schwarzenegger and Willis during the final shoot out."

","The first film was okay, and a good excuse for nostalgia with some of the greatest action movie stars of the 1980's and 1990's, it was debatable whether I wanted to see a sequel, but with a couple more great stars and the critics preferring the follow-up, I had to see it, from director Simon West (Con Air, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider). Basically the film opens in Nepal where the band of high skilled mercenaries, ""The Expendables"", are there to rescue a Chinese businessman and the rival of leader Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger, in one of his first roles since retiring as Governor of California), and martial artist Yin Yang (Jet Li) makes sure the VIP gets home safely. Ross then gets his next mission when he is forced by Mr. Church (Bruce Willis), since he owes him a favour to make them even, he and his team have to find a crashed aeroplane and retrieve the item inside, accompanied by tech genius Maggie (Nan Yu). The mission goes well until team sniper Billy 'The Kid' Timmons (Triangle's Liam Hemsworth, Chris's brother) is captured by Jean Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme) and at gunpoint demands the item back, and even though he gets it eventually he sticks a knife into Billy's heart, killing him, and gets away, the gang swear revenge on the life of their young companion. The item is revealed by Maggie to have contained blueprints documenting the location of five tons of plutonium abandoned by the Soviet Union in a mine, Villain and his accomplice Hector (Scott Adkins) intend to steal and sell it. The team led by Ross, with blades specialist Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), sniper Gunner Jensen (Rocky IV's Dolph Lundgren), weapons specialist Hale Caesar (White Chicks' Terry Crews) and demolitions expert Toll Road (wrestler Randy Couture), they head for the mines. They are infiltrated by a group of Villain's soldiers, the Sangs, but single-handed Booker (Chuck Norris) saves them, and before departing he tells them that they can get help from the nearby villagers who are against Villain, they are all female and trying to keep their children safe. All the men of the village have been taken by Villain and forced to work in the mines to get to the plutonium, they have never returned to their families, and when the Sangs return to take more villagers the mercenaries kill them and stop this from happening. The Expendables stage a surprise attack in the mines by crashing their plane, which they survive, but explosives trap them inside the caves, but soon enough Trench and Church show up to rescue them and to join them in the fight, and they also help the male villagers to escape. The heroes go into battle with the villains in the airport, where the plutonium is ready to be transported, but The Expendables, plus Trench, Church and Booker kill all the bad guys, Christmas decapitates Hector with a rotating helicopter blade, and Ross and Villain fight to the death until the villain is stabbed. Church, who calls it even with Ross, Maggie, Booker, and Trench all go their separate ways, the team get a new plane since their old one was ruined, Billy's girlfriend Sophia (Nikolette Noel) gets a large sum of money and his letter to her, and The Expendables all give a final toast to Billy. Also starring Amanda Ooms as Pilar and Novak Djokovic. Stallone, not directing this time, is much more prominent than possibly the original film, Van Damme is fantastic as the often intense villain, Willis gets more screen time to kick ass, Schwarzenegger is the butt for most of the best jokes, Norris gets a funny and cool entrance and shoots up, and the other cast members (besides Li who is hardly on screen at all) get their time to make laughs and thrill as well. The story is more organised than the first film was, the nostalgia of action man stuff is definitely much more entertaining than before, the fights, gun play, explosions and blood spill is highly engaging and exciting, and with many of the most well-loved stars of these kind of films you can slip right into it, a great fun action comedy. Good!"

This movie is a nostalgia put together of all our favorite heroes, even Bruce Willis took up the gun in this one, and Arnold had more screen time and used the phrase ""I'll be back"" a little too much.<br/><br/>As usual Chuck Norris was the ultimate bad ass, although he had few screen time.<br/><br/>Stallone went all the way to add more characters to the ensemble cast; Stallone had already made plans for the sequel before the release of the first Expendables. Stallone opted out of writing or directing the sequel, and the movie was done to a PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>Van Damme redesigned his and Stallone's characters' final fight. As he was unhappy with the scripted fight which involved his character running away.<br/><br/>The movie plot is similar to the first a simple job gone bad as Barney and his old-school mercenaries go on a mission when things go wrong and one of their own is viciously killed, the Expendables are compelled to seek revenge in hostile territory where the odds are stacked against them.<br/><br/>Then when it looks like lights out for the whole crew, when they were out of bullets and facing a whole army and an armored tank, Chuck Norris comes along and evens the odds.<br/><br/>He didn't really even the odds, it wasn't fair to the army and the armored tank they were outnumbered. As we all know it takes more than one armor tank and an army to take on Chuck Norris.<br/><br/>Now as per acting goes, this guys are all professionals and so they did well, but the script is a little out of it, the directing and the wise cracks was not part of the movie at all.<br/><br/>The thing is the movie is just for you to enjoy the nostalgic experience. A Third installment is on the way and i look forward to seeing it as majority of the people we see here will be back."

His men hold Billy hostage and force them to give up the map. Afterwards they Kill Billy. And The Expendables make this a personal mission. It doesn't matter that the madman has enslaved a whole town and forced the men to dig for the plutonium. It Doesn't matter that he's planning to sell it to the highest bidder. What Does matter is that he kill their friend. So they're going to kill him. When the action gets hot and they're outnumbered they get a assist from an old Friend Booker. I just want to say this. Chuck Norris still has it. Seeing him interact with Stallone and Company was worth the price of the ticket. Along the way Villain's Army outnumbers them and they get help from Mr.Church and Trench. The Cliamax is fast Action packed and you relive the days of your youth watching these guys go to work. It's a great feeling seeing these guys do this. The Film is clich√©d in some scenes. But they make it work. In the end to boil it down to it's basic core is this. The Good Guy's against the bad guys. The Good Guys win. With a lot of style hot hardcore action. And Witty one liners. The Expendables II will not win any Oscars. It's not going to change the world or cure cancer. But it'll take you back in time to when these stars were our heroes and the best in the business. This film is going to do what it sets out to do. Entertain you. That's all. Shut your brain off sit back and be prepared to enjoy yourself. If you enjoyed any movies in which these gentlemen starred in. You will enjoy this. If you didn't then This is not the film for you. Stay away then. But for those who are pure action fans. This film was made for you."

","What else matters really...than being entertained and having a good time when watching a movie ? OK, sometimes it's good I guess to watch movies with a meaning or with a political statement or whatever...artsy movies, movies that will make you cry and long for your mummy. Movies with complex multi-layered plots. Well...Expendables 2 is not that kind of movie. Not even close. Not even on the same planet actually. Thank god ! This movie does not have a meaning or a political statement. It's not artsy. It doesn't even have a story. Not at all. Nada. Zip. Nothing (OK, our heroes go after a very bad villain called Mr. Villain, but that's it). Yet, it's a great movie !!<br/><br/>Because what this movie does have is a) every major action star from the last 40 years (minus Seagal, Snipes, Dwayne Johnson and some others, but they will probably all pop up in Expendables 3). b) a lot of action....the opening sequence is 20 minutes of non-stop pure action heaven. c) a lot of cheesy one-liners...but guess what, they are actually funny ! I laughed and cheered all the way through this movie...and the laughs were not unintentional. d) Ohhh...and did I also mention that this movie has HEART. Lots of it ! Yes, this movie will put it's arm around you and say ""hey buddy, you OK ? don't worry, life sucks sometimes, but let's just forget about all our troubles and enjoy for a while. Cheers mate...clink"" Our heroes are tough yes...they show no mercy to their enemies of course. But still deep down...they are nice guys with warm hearts. And it shows in this movie. We actually do get to care about them a little.<br/><br/>Anyway...bottom line. This is a feel good action movie. If you liked the first, you will love this one. And if you didn't like the first...you will love this one. It's bigger, better, warmer, nicer, funnier etc. And it's also a little adventurous...they even get stuck inside a cave ! Enough talking...go see it already !"
"Samiam3","7","1","6","20 August 2012"," Still noisy, but much improved
","The Expendables are the dream team of action heroes, but what they amount to is a fighting machine that lacks character. Or at least that was the case with the first film.<br/><br/>The Expendables 2 is no less noisy than its predecessor, but it shows improvement as a movie. What elevates this sequel its ability to wink at itself. It does this frequently enough to make the uncontrolled violence a bit more endurable. There is enough self-satire to the appearances of Schwarzenegger and Norris to make their presence quite worth while. The principle characters feel much less interchangeable in personality than they did in the last movie, partially because there are fewer of them. The working of a principle female character into the script is another nice touch, and I like that the movie doesn't make here a superficial bombshell in the way that other movies do. <br/><br/>The intended audience is going to be well satisfied, but I'm not sure how Jean Claude Van Damme's fans will take it. The problem is not that he is a villain, but rather he is a lame villain. The few lines he has are poorly scripted, and his face is somehow always in shadow, leading me to the conclusion that he did NOT need to be in this movie. Anybody else would have been well at home in that role, provided that they could tackled Stallone.<br/><br/>In a strange kind of way, Sylvester Stallone seems a bit more endurable in his old age. beneath his brawny facade, there is a small sense of melancholy to the guy. Maybe it's just because he is the star, but he always seems a tad bit more human than his colleagues.<br/><br/>In the end though, it's just entertainment. A lot of bullets/knives go flying, a lot of vehicles get flipped, a lot of one liners get delivered. It's probably a bit overwhelming for most, but it's better than the first movie."

","OH MY GOD!!! THIS WAS LIKE THE GREATEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!<br/><br/>Okay, so that above statement isn't true. Without ever trying too hard, The Expendables 2, a movie that recreates the mindless high octane thrills of the 80's, is even bigger and better than the guilty pleasure original. It features a cast of former and current action stars including, but not limited to Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Terry Crews, Chuck Norris, Dolph Lundgren, Bruce Willis, and the catch-phraseinator himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/>Reliably cheesy, thoroughly ridiculous, and almost devoid of any character development, the movie succeeds as a throwback to the brainless banter and over the top stunts of old school action flicks. The script is basically an excuse for a string of these action scenes stitched together, but other than that, the movie just plays it simple in plotting. It moves quickly, it holds a sense of nostalgia, and any movie with Rambo, John McClain, and the Terminator in the same frame is okay by me.<br/><br/>Most of the dialogue is the witty banter between the characters (and that adds to the already great chemistry), with some good ol' one-liners thrown in. It even gives the cast chances to poke fun at themselves. Moments like an exchange between Willis and Schwarzenegger that recalls previous movies of the two are particularly golden. It's the ultimate in self parody, and the action's pretty entertaining, too. Bring on the next installment, and for that female expendable that's supposed to join the cast, may it either be Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton. That would make my day!<br/><br/>*** / *****"

","This movie took me back 20 years. Its a complete trip back on the good old action from the 80s and 90s. Its all the first movie could not be. Lots of shooting, lots of unbelievable killings hehe (like the 90s), lots of fights, crashes and everything you expect when you go see a movie that has Arnold, Stallone, Sthatan, Jet li, CHUCK, JCVD, Willis and all the gang. <br/><br/>One thing missing on the first one was well taken care: a real villain. <br/><br/>Its the kind of movie you don't care about the lies or plot. You just enjoy for what it is: ACTION, action, action. Even with all the bullshit, Im glad they brought back the 90s style. The CGI sucks, and actually I loved that, because it brougth back the times when things were done the hard way, not a bunch of guys in front of a green screen talking to nobody. The short come was Jet li suddenly disappearing half way into the movie, but thats barely noticeable with the introduction of Chuck Noris into the plot. I think if Jet Li was going to leave the set, they could have used that to add some drama, like the bad guys killing him for example, so we would really hate them (instead of killing a character we don't care about). <br/><br/>Personally, loved the movie. Got love Arnold and Norris back kicking ass with the big guns and making bad internet jokes hehe.<br/><br/>So, it is what it is. A movie not to be taking serious (even the actors make jokes of their former selves) but to be greatly enjoyed by all the viewers how have, or have not, seem this guys in action."

","Yes, ""All You Can Ask For..."" in an action movie with the biggest action stars and breath-taking action scenes. What I found most priceless was seeing Arnold, Bruce, and Sly walking together side-by-side as the gunned-down the bad-guys. In all honesty this edition was slightly better than the first. <br/><br/>Now you can't forget JCVD! His performance as a bad-guy traces right back to early film roots (No Retreat, No Surrender, and Black Eagle). Needless to say, JCVD plays a much better ""Villian"" than a good guy. His French accent and cold demeanor gave him a powerful presence in each of his scenes. <br/><br/>The writing had it's inevitable weaknesses, but displayed some keen wit at times as well. One brilliant stroke was having Chuck Norris reprise his major film debut role as CIA Black-Ops Agent John T. Booker (Good Guys Wear Black) with a touch of J.J. McQuade (Lone Wolf McQuade).<br/><br/>Stallone has been known to have a phobia of letting someone else sit in the directors seat in His films, but that may change after this outing. Rumor has it that a 3rd movie is in the works using the same writer as #2 in Dave Callaham. Rumor also has it that Nicolas Cage may be entering the fold of what is becoming an action all-star retreat.<br/><br/>Once again Stallone has amazed us with his brilliance in originality as well as his well-known ""never-say-die"" approach which gives him ""the- edge"" among film makers. This film (along with film #1) is a must-see, and/or a must collectors item in your film library. Expect #3 to be out in 2 years."

","The Expendables 2 is probably the most explosive action movie that never wasted a single second of its running time. While the movie is complete with all the elements of the action genre, it has exempted itself from the stereotype and label of action movies that the stars of this film set in their own respective action films. Instead, everyone shed off his trademark and blended perfectly with everyone else to come up with this unique and excellent action-packed movie. Another great thing about this movie is that though an all-star cast, no character undermined the other. Each character is significant in his own way. However, the one thing that probably made this movie so great was the emotional aspect of the film. The death of one character brought an intense emotion that even the audience felt. I admit I was emotionally haunted by the death of this character and when the leader said something like why people who deserve to live a good life die and bad people just don't die. This aspect sets this movie apart from other action films. I wished I had seen more of Jet Li though but overall this movie is so enjoyable, thrilling it kept me at the edge of my seat from start to finish, and has a great story.<br/><br/>The Expendables 2 ended with a great climax and I almost gave a loud applause inside the movie theater when the credits started to roll up the screen.

","""The Expendables 2"" -- better than the original (should we say, more seasoned). The film is a light-hearted hard-hitting, romantic-comedic romp though real-man irony, subtle love, devotion, hard action, sweat, bravado, camaraderie and solitary angst set loose wit,h fast-paced dialog (...well, fast-paced one-liners), in a story-board whose continuity should not be noted too closely. Waffling between persona, cameo, and character, the stars are all smashing. And the exchange of Chuck Norris for Mickey Rourke offers up truly new grist (evidenly Mickey was expendable, and Norris was offered more than he could refuse). And Charisma Carpenter is back, briefly. Don't try this at home! See it in the theater.

","The second installment of the Expendables is not as well directed or written as the previous version. The script is what is lacking in this movie--there are a lot of useless scenes and not as much character as the first movie. The action is fast paced and it is sometimes funny to see 60-year olds beat up on young men. Jean Claude is basically Jean Claude as the villain and he is serviceable, but it would have been a better climax to have JC fight Chuck Norris to see the two martial arts men in action. Unfortunately this is a Sly driven film so that you have the bull rush of Rocky fighting the grace of JC--too bad it is a short scene and not worthy of a big climax.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie. I did not have high hopes for the film since the first one was not a Rocky, Terminator, Die Hard or Lone Wolf McQuade, but it was fun. I expected less than the original unless there was a screenwriter with a better vision, but you get what you usually get with sequels--a decent product that doesn't match up to the first film.<br/><br/>The best part of the film is the quips between the characters. While there are some good lines between Randy, Dolph, Jet and Terry--the best lines are the ones shared by Sly, Arnold, Bruce and Chuck Norris.<br/><br/>A good movie to see your favorite ""old"" action heroes, but not something new or original that is going to WoW you."

"TheUnknown837-1","7","1","8","7 September 2012"," A movie reviewer can gripe about redundancy in the cinema, but we all must come to terms with the fact that sometimes the redundancy is exactly what we are looking for
","""The Expendables 2"" is a little closer to the film that I had expected the first film to be: a little more serious, a little lighter on the wisecracks, a little closer to, what I can assume, would be the life of a group of mercenaries. Keep in mind, however, that one the real joys of the first ""The Expendables"" was that I didn't know how heavy it would be on the humor, and that was part of the reason why I enjoyed it so much. So there is not as many jokes and gags in this new film, but it is essentially the same sort of picture. It is also one of my more favorite films of this year.<br/><br/>A movie reviewer can gripe about redundancy in the cinema, but we all must come to terms with the fact that sometimes the redundancy is exactly what we are looking for. Particularly in a movie like ""The Expendables 2."" In a movie like this, where you have some of the best old-time action stars‚ÄîSylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Bruce Willis, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren, Chuck Norris, among others‚Äîwhat you want to see is lots of gunfights, lots of explosions, lots of bodies thumping against each other, and lots of references to the actors' glory days. ""The Expendables 2,"" as written by Mr. Stallone and Richard Wenk, takes these familiar advantages and pushes them to the hilt. Even Mr. Willis and Mr. Schwarzenegger, who had very small but memorable parts in the first movie, are allowed to riff on their own histories and reputations here. Just like with the first film, it is a great nostalgic trip as the stars essentially quote or reference ""First Blood,"" ""Die Hard,"" and ""The Terminator."" It's not just cheap marketing gags; it's the filmmakers getting the audience involved. After all, who going to see this movie is not familiar with those blood-and-guts films of yesterday?<br/><br/>The stars play very well off each other. Once again, I particularly liked the sarcastic dynamic between Mr. Stallone and Mr. Statham, the latter of who proves the second time around that he is a very good actor. He just needs to pick wiser, better screenplays more often. I do compliment everybody else in the movie, including Nan Yu as a mercenary/computer hacker who the group has to drag along on a seemingly fatal mission in the wilderness. The two others I want to single out for compliments are Mr. Schwarzenegger and Mr. Van Damme, who are making triumphant returns to the movies. Mr. Van Damme plays an especially icy villain here; Mr. Schwarzenegger proves that even though he is getting up there in age, he still has what it takes to be a star. I want to see more of him in the movies again, even if he needs to employ a stunt double a little more often. I also liked how the semi-romantic dynamic between Mr. Stallone and Miss Yu never fully revolved, and instead played smart at numbing it down. I'm sure the filmmakers' excuse is that Mr. Stallone looks much too old to be kissing Miss Yu, but the real reason is because it would be an insanely bad idea for this film, even if Mr. Stallone was still thirty years old.<br/><br/>In regards to what did not please me, I had a few quibbles with the way the picture was edited. Sometimes the camera angles jump and jostle around too much, even when not much is happening. For instance, when Mr. Stallone first meets Miss Yu, both of motorcycle, and she whisks away after making a snappy remark, the camera jumps from her gunning to her engine, to a brief shot from behind her as she continues to gun her engine, and then to the side again as she speeds away. The second shot lasts less than a second is completely unnecessary. And although most of the fights are very well-filmed, the use of computer-generated blood becomes a little more obvious the second time around. One of the things Mr. Stallone did so wisely in directing the first movie was to stage most of the bloody fight sequences in dimmer lighting, to conceal this a bit better. While I compliment the new director, Simon West, in staging a fight in broad daylight, this comes to a disadvantage with how much computer-generated blood he wanted to use. On a side note, even though Chuck Norris scores some great moments in this film, I did want to see a little more of him. He's not an unwelcome screen presence for me.<br/><br/>I had the same sort of expectations with ""The Expendables 2"" as I did with the first movie: I wanted to have the time of my life, and that was exactly what I received. And no matter how old the actors may get, this is the sort of franchise that I would like to see continue. Again, sometimes the familiarity is exactly what you want from a movie. Did I learn anything about life or people from ""The Expendables 2?"" Certainly not. But I was not bored or disinterested or displeased with it, and this is the sort of movie that I look forward to seeing again sometime."

Best parts: 1. Playing ""The Good, the bad, and the ugly"" theme song every time Chuck Norris stepped into frame (in slow motion, of course.) 2. Hearing Schwarzenegger say ""I'll be back,"" ""Yippie Kai Yay,"" AND ""Who's next? Rambo?"" all in under 60 seconds. 3. The tantric experience of waiting the ENTIRE movie to see Van Damme do his beautiful jumping spin-kick, and then finally seeing it not once, but TWICE in a row and both completely decking Signore Stallone. 4.

"jcvdfan83","10","1","8","4 September 2012"," The Expendables 2 explodes!!!!
","First off if your expecting an Oscar winning script or movie, then The Expendables 2 is not for you. I mean come on people, I have been seeing reviews from others that have been downing the whole film, talking about how bad the script was. What really got me was that someone actually wrote a bad review about the score and the lighting and etc, I mean really? Its an ACTION MOVIE!, your not there to see people cry over heart break or their boyfriend being sent off to the army. Your there to see explosions and big gun plays and fight scenes and this movie did not disappoint. The Expendables 2 to me was a lot better then the first one and should be seen by anyone who loves action and wants to have a fun time at the movies. My biggest surprise about this movie and I believe was a big steal of a role for the movie was JCVD. Jean-Claude Van Damme who plays the movies main bad guy ""Vilain"" was a shocker to me, Jean-Claude has mostly recently been doing low budget, strait to DVD movies. It was great to see him back on the big screen and back into action and I believe he delivered really well with his performance as the main bad guy. He was crazy and cool and bad ass, he might not get an Oscar like Heath Ledger did for his performance as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" but JCVD's Villain will be remembered. JCVD deserves's more big budget projects, Can you hear me Spielberg or Nolan or Michael Bay, Van Damme can act.<br/><br/>The movie starts out big, with a lot of action in the beginning, it slightly dies down a bit in the center but not for a long time, it picks up quick and kinda goes quick, almost hard to keep up to be honest. The adrenaline in this movie is insane, and I thought that the action was insane and awesome!. Thats what we wanted, and this is a one of a kind action movie just because this will be the first and only time you will see Stallone, Schwarzeneggar, Willis, Statham, Li and JCVD all together in one movie, that right there should be a good enough reason to go see it. And don't forget about Chuck Norris, who I thought did an okay job. When I first heard that Liams Hemsworth was going to be in The Expendables 2, to be honest, I was like What? Stallone what was you thinking? Are you really that desperate to get a younger crowd to see this?. But after I saw the film, Hemsworth wasn't that bad and worked well for the whole film. "" I don't want to spoil anything but Hemsworth will not be in the third one"", lol. The script for this film actually works great for this type of movie, A revenge story that makes it explosive with anger. This movie was a lot more funnier then the first one and I thought that Dolph was more of the comic one in this one. Yun was a great addition to cast as the first female expendable and did really well. The one liners by Willis and Schwarzeneggar were put together well and funny in parts especially when they are bashing at each other from past film relations such as ""The Terminator, Rambo and Die Hard"". The Expendables 2 explodes with action in the beginning and rarely lets up, my only downfalls about this movie was I thought that JCVD and Scott Adkins deserved more screen time, and the fight between Stallone and JCVD could have been longer but it was still a good fight.<br/><br/>It was great to see these Iconic action stars together in one film and I had a lot of fun watching this movie and I want to go see it again!. The Expendables 2 deserves to be seen in the theaters and its a must see, especially if you love action movies or you just want to go and have a fun time in the movies!. The Expendables 2 is a type of movie that was made for going to the movies! Who wants to go see a tear jerker at the movies unless your on a valentine's date?. Action, Horror, Comedy, Epic, Syfy adventures are what the movies are all about. Action movies are suppose to be dumb fun and senseless scripts, just like the ones in the 80's and early 90's are made. This was one of the best movies of 2012 and one of the best action movies ever."

","This is a solid action movie. It has lots of action, a good story, good acting and some snappy dialog. Sylvester Stallone plays the lead role with a combination of power and warmth and the rest of the cast is excellent too. The rapport between Mr. Stallone and Jason Statham is excellent; they make an effective action team. It was surprising to find Jean-Claude Vandam playing out of character, in this case, a despicable villain, but his performance is excellent. The presence of Arnold Schwarzeneggar, Bruce Willis and Chuck Norris also helps to make this movie a good entertaining experience. But ultimately, the reason why this movie succeeds is because instead of relying exclusively on flashy special effects and intense action sequences, the movie tells a story without which the movie would just be a lot of noise."

He was great as usual, but he just looked too plastic for me, and it kind of ruined his character for me, spending a lot of the time smoking his cigar, and flirting with the young girl, pretty much like Connery did with Zeta-Jones in Entrapment.<br/><br/>But that's really my only gripe, Stallone is the main character, but the least interesting sadly. So thank heavens there is a wealth of 'talent ' on screen with him, and Van Damme is easily the best thing in the whole film. He's cocky, and has a swagger that makes him a great Vil(l)ain. He's no Gruber, but it's one of his best roles.<br/><br/>Arnie and Willis are 'back', and even though they have more screen time, they spend the majority of it referencing movies, but it's fun.<br/><br/>Norris appears a couple of times at the hour of need, but his cameo is a little too over the top, and doesn't fit in.<br/><br/>But it's violent for violent sake, and whoever says the blood was added in to get a higher rating is clearly wrong, it's brutal, over the top and so right for this kind of film.<br/><br/>Brimming with awful but funny one liners, good performances from all involved, and a silly homo-erotic subplot involving Stathams jealousy of Hemsworth and Stallones friendship, the Expendables is not just a great sequel, it's easily better than the first, because is doesn't have on serious bone in it's body."

"jaguiar313","7","1","11","17 August 2012"," Flawed but still fun action sequel.
","Expendables 2 is a fun follow-up to the 2010 eighties action throwback hit that isn't quite as engaging in it's quieter moments as the previous flick but, thankfully there aren't too many of those. This installment finds the gang being sent by the mysterious Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) after a downed plane in Eastern Europe to recover the contents of an on board safe. Along for the ride is Maggie (Yu Nan), a tech specialist and new sniper, Billy (Liam Hemsworth). But, they are intercepted by a gang of armed thugs headed by the cold blooded Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme) and henchman Hector( Scott Adkins) who take their quarry and kill one of the team. Now it's personal as Barney (Stallone) and Co. seek to track down Villain and put him down. Along for the bullet-ridden ride are old rival Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger), Mr. Church and legendary 'Lone Wolf' mercenary Booker (Chuck Norris). When the action is flying fast and furious, EX2 is a real blast. It's great to see Arnold, Van Damme and Norris back on screen doing what they do best. Van Damme in particular seems to be having fun chewing up the Eastern European scenery as the lethal bad guy and he doesn't get enough screen time, sadly, to really establish the character's full menace. Aside from an overuse of CGI blood, director Simon West gives us some good, old-fashioned rip-roaring action scenes that fit the retro action icon cast perfectly and some good hand to hand combat as well. Although some of those, especially Stallone v.s. Van Damme, could have gone on a bit longer to give them more dramatic intensity. And drama is where West stumbles. The scenes between the action, which should be engaging and strong to keep us involved until the bullets fly again, are rather ho-hum. The dramatic scenes, though few, needed some energy, some 'POP'. The camaraderie between the team members that Stallone captured so well in part 1 is weak here and because of that we are less forgiving of the cheesy dialog and the characters are less engaging because of it. Perfect example is Lundgren's Gunner who practically stole the flick first time around, is nowhere near as fun as in EX1 and the fun Statham/ Stallone relationship is also weaker. The in-between scenes also had a quicker pace under Stallone's direction last time and thus we were able to overlook the plot holes easier. But, this is an action film and there is plenty of that and who is in action is why we sat in our seat and on that level Expendables 2 delivers on what we came to see. I am all for Expendables 3 but, find a director that can put some energy in the drama, give the team their team spirit back and a writer who can give them some livelier banter... as well as deliver the carnage."
"neil-476","7","1","12","17 August 2012"," Utter rubbish, but good fun
","The all-star action hero fest that was The Expendables returns for another go on the merry-go-round. No Micky Rourke this time, but Chuck Norris turns up, Jean-Claude Van Damme serves nicely as the baddie, and there is decent second fiddle support from Liam Hemsworth and Nan Yu.<br/><br/>The plot is barely worth mentioning - some nonsense about plutonium in a disused mine being stolen for sale to terrorists - because this is all about muscles, fighting, explosions, and vast amounts of ammunition being expended (and, of course, it is all magic ammunition: the goodies' ammo all strikes baddies with splashes of very obviously CGI blood, and none of the baddies' ammo goes anywhere near a goodie).<br/><br/>It is interesting to note that, thanks to Chuck Norris I believe, the unnecessary foul language which littered the first movie is conspicuous by its absence: this film is the better for that.<br/><br/>The action is done well, and some of the interplay is fun: Willis and Schwarzenegger get more to do this time, and clearly enjoy doing it (and Schwarzenegger's final comment is telling).<br/><br/>It's tosh, of course - when the opening action sequence finds the heroes ziplining from a shell-ravaged town into the jungle, well...."
"hopla68","8","1","13","17 August 2012"," a must see but it could have been better
","The expendables brought together stars that fitted exactly in my world when I was in my teens. As an 80's child the first movie was really a dream come through, to see all those old muscle bound wisecracking stars of old fire it up once again. When you get a certain age the nostalgia factor comes into view more and more and the first movie delivered on every front. It was a "" mans"" movie.<br/><br/>what made it even more appealing was the fact that Stallone bet everything he had on that single movie ( after medium success with the new parts of the Rambo and Rocky series). the behind the scenes clearly showed all of his efforts in this regard. And in my opinion you could sense that in the first movie, everyone involved wanted it to be a success, understood the rarity of having all those guys at once on the screen and combined with a certain ferociousness and blood thirst not seen in todays films ( especially in the hand to hand combat fights) made it in ways an almost primal testosterone experience.<br/><br/>And now we have - of course- part 2.<br/><br/>Because the first movie was a well deserved - and by me well applauded- success the heat isn't on for Stallone and his friends. There is still much riding of course on this second effort but it isn't personal anymore, this is just movie-making. Which doesn't mean this movie doesn't deliver the explosions, gunfights etc but something is missing. There are no more primal fights in small corridors, the - agreed somewhat overdone- sadistic undertones from the first are gone and there is never the sense those guys are actually fighting an outnumbered fight and fighting with everything they got.<br/><br/>Instead you get the - agreed it is funny most of the time- one liners and the making fun of there past careers sequences. It takes itself not serious at all but the difference with the first is that the jokes are not in between the fighting anymore; which makes it too much of a parody. Standouts are the underused VanDamme and Scott Adkins - very good in undisputed- that didn't get enough screen time to use there skills so to say. It still shows that VanDamme can easily carry a movie and that Adkins really deserves a breakthrough. The Statham - Adkins and the Van Damme - Stallone fights are too short but do bring the blood and guts feeling from the first movie back, somewhat. Locations and stunts are plenty full, although from a technical standpoint the editing is lacking here and there. the East European Scenery is rather dull to look at, its just too overused in countless other action movies. Cameo from Norris is almost a little quiz how much you know from his antics back in the day. Schwarzenegger is lacking form in the way he presents himself and one wonders what made him - also for me back in the day- such a big star to begin with.<br/><br/>All in all this outing lacks the no holds barred, everything is riding on this and we are going to make it gritty feeling of the first, in a certain sense it lacks a heart.This is far more laid back, humorous then the first. The people involved know this is going to be a ( still deserved) success and you can feel it. In fact in some ways in felt like "" the last action hero"" which overplayed its hand in the parody department.This doesn't mean it is a letdown, its still miles above the polished everyman hero movie ( new total recall anyone) that flocks the screens nowadays and as an action fan you still owe it to yourself to watch this on the big screen. Because Stallone is right; seeing all these guys in the same movie is a small miracle and still very cool to look at. There aren't that many actors left that actually put in the effort in front of but also behind the camera in regards to working out, or doing martial arts. The whole physical side of action stars is disappeared out of todays movies, which in my opinion is a shame."
"Tweekums","8","0","1","21 March 2016"," Non-stop meat-headed action¬Ö just what was required!
","After a ten minute opening sequence where Barney Ross and team of action heroes rescue Trench and a Chinese billionaire from a large force in Nepal the real story starts. Barney and his team are forced to take on a job in Albania where they are to recover an item from a crashed plane; unfortunately no sooner have they recovered the item it is taken from them by a terrorist named Villain who murders one of Barney's team before leaving. It turns out the item was a map to a mine where five tons of ex-Soviet weapons grade plutonium are stored. Barney and his band of expendables along with Chinese expert Maggie Chan set off to find Villain and foil his plans to sell the plutonium.<br/><br/>If you are looking for serious drama or even something vaguely believable you will be disappointed¬Ö however if you want full on meat-headed action then this is the film for you. The action is over the top but it is fairly full on from start to finish. The cast is chock full of action stars with Stallone, Statham, Lundgren and Van Damme in major roles as well as appearances from Arnie, Bruce Willis, Jet Li and Chuck Norris in extended cameos. It is great seeing such a variety of action stars in one film and none of them disappoint as they wipe out swathes of bad guys and swap catchphrases. The less well known cast members aren't overwhelmed by their better known co-stars. The action is pretty bloody and I dread to think what the final death toll was; bad guys are dispatched in a wide variety of ways. As this is all so over the top it isn't particularly disturbing though. Overall this was a lot of fun; fans of classic action films should love it."

This is bad B- Movie entertainment with a big budget. Too much money and too many stars for it to fall this flat. It's made for Mystery Science Theater 3000 as a film to talk back to the screen and laugh at as the really bad jokes flop, one after another.<br/><br/>I knew we were going to have a problem when Stallone, now well past his prime, goes into a bar with Statham and take on the really, really huge guy. You can see one of them flop to the ground after Stallone visibly swings wide and completely misses the target. That scene epitomizes this film. You are left wondering whether there was editing and, if it was edited, they just said ""screw it. These idiots who came to see our first movie won't give a damn. They are here for the big names, our recycled dumb lines, big explosions and bad villains we hate. Plot? We don't need no stinking plot! Let's just serve us up a sexy Chinese woman and we are golden.""<br/><br/>What a stinker. Humor is forced right down your throat that is painful. Leading to action scenes that looked like they were staged on a set in Hollywood. Nobody in the street but 100 guys with submachine guns taking on a handful of our heroes. Thousands of rounds are fired and yet not one of these idiots can even come close to hitting our heroes. Even massive artillery doesn't help with their aim. The film should have just treated itself as a total comedy right from the start. <br/><br/>It's really that bad."

","The Expendables 2 (2012) it's really action packed and one of the best movies of the franchise. It is even better than the first one! You're blasted off in the first few minutes leading up to the actual story. Obviously, this is not a film with a great script or impressive acting. However, the story works well for what it's supposed to do! It is greatly entertaining if you are looking for an action packed movie loaded with iconic action stars like Stallone, Statham, Lundgren, Willis and Schwarzenegger. Back for War!<br/><br/>No time from opening credits, its straight into the action, which is more epic , and is what should have been seen in the first film but maybe due to a low budget we were subjected to a lesser affair The team work well, all of them and Hemsworth does really well as the new boy on the block and second time round and you kind of know these guys. Arnie, Bruce are seen more but are not seen as much as the usual gang, and Li is seen the least. Norris is great, seen here and there, great entrance and more of a cameo, and Van Damme makes good his role as the villain. Different locations than the first movie great performances by Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme with different roles that's what makes this movie the best in the franchise. I do like the First one but if I am ranting the best of the franchise I choose 2 in my opinion the best of the movie franchise I do like a lot the first movie the most that I have remember it was 2. <br/><br/>I was pumped. I'll admitted that. Best action movie all year. That's a fact people. The Expendables 2 is also one of my favorite action movies. The first time I saw this movie I loved it much more than the first one I did. This time the story is set in Europe and It Is American movie and I wish Jet Li had more screen time then only like 13 minutes or 15.minutes or how many times he had. Other things I enjoyed more than I did the third one. Like the first movie, I really enjoyed this one too especially getting to see Chuck Norris sharing the screen with Stallone and Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/>You pretty much know what you're getting with ""The Expendables 2"": a group of past-and-present action stars making wisecracks and blowing stuff up. And much like its predecessor, this film delivers on a truly massive scale. The plot itself is pretty straightforward. Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) has a relatively simple task for the Expendables, whose epic ranks include Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, and, this time out, Chuck Norris and Arnold Schwarzenegger. But when the plan goes awry, our heroes seek vengeance against the ruthless mercenary Jean Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme). From the rapidly-paced action sequences to the ridiculously over-the-top deaths, this film plays out like a big-budget B movie on steroids.<br/><br/>One problem I do have with the film I forgot to mentioned: Why Did Schwarzenegger used his line I'll be back from The Terminator and Willis used his words against him by saying: ""You've been back enough. I'll be back."" Schwarzenegger: ""Yippee-ki-yay."" why were those lines written in the script? Why did those two actors had to make a fool of them self's? With both of their famous roles: Terminator and Die Hard-John McClane ? Why? I am sorry I don't like that those two famous actors make fool of them self's, by spelling wrong their famous lines! Why was no Mickey Rourke in this film? I loved him in the first film, why wasn't he here. Why was Jet Li only 13.mins. in here? Why was this film set in the Europe and not on American Soil? Those are just the main problems I just have with the film, I am sorry, but I am just been honest. <br/><br/>The Expendables are back and this time it's personal! When one of their own is viciously killed, Barney (Sylvester Stallone) and his band of mercenaries cut a swath of destruction to avenge their lost teammate and race to stop five tons of weapons-grade plutonium from falling into the wrong hands. This action-packed sequel boasts an all-star cast, including Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Chuck Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Bruce Willis, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. An awesome basic plot of the film! <br/><br/>I love this film to death and it is my favorite best film of Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis, Lundgren, Norris and Van Damme. I am giving a 10/10 to this film because it deserves it and I just love it to death! I did enjoy it and it was awesome for me. If you're looking for a great movie like a critic at RT then you're going to be disappointed. Look at the cast and just see it for what it always was intended to be; a classic action movie with classic lines and even awesome action scenes. <br/><br/>So that was what I expected and loved it<br/><br/>The Expendables 2 is a 2012 American ensemble action film directed by Simon West, written by Richard Wenk and Sylvester Stallone and based on a story by Ken Kaufman, David Agosto and Wenk.

"dragokin","2","0","1","4 October 2014"," much worse than the first part
","There is one significant difference between The Expendables 2 and the first installment: The script has been written by a high school pupil in love with action movies. Otherwise it is the same as all Stallone action flicks since the 1980's, a trend that would probably continue in The Expendables 3. Thanks to the stellar cast and all cameos, Sylvester Stallone might even be hailed as a savior of the ""classical"" action film. But we're getting sidetracked...<br/><br/>The Expendables was not particularly good, but was watchable, unlike The Expendables 2. After the success of the first part, the writers stopped worrying about physics or limitations of human body. To compensate for that, they filled the script with references on other movies by the same actors, as well as internet jokes about them. The best example is the cameo of Chuck Norris. It goes without saying that these were actually jokes on high school level, because The Expendables 2 probably tried to tap into the audience of the corresponding age."

","A masterful work that imbues you to it through its realism. The film is dark, brooding, intense and most of all depressing. It is hard to watch at times and difficult to call enjoyable, but the story is still powerful. Stallone's is not the restrained performance that the critics have described. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. The trains of violence can't be stopped and their incessant movement brings about reactive forces in the people it affects. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them."

At best this movie could play as a ""Kemp piece"" which holds a mirror to a ""male whack off"" culture which underlines ""spend time at the gym - not at the library"" if only this was anywhere near a mental vicinity of the filmmakers while making this movie. The problem with these kinds of movies is that, ironically, filmmakers think they're making a good film... as one notable writer once mused ""we've seen so much crap in movies that we don't even recognize it as crap anymore."" and this is sad."

","Okay, this is not a serious movie. It's supposed to be ""bad"". Bad in a way that's funny which should mean it's still good. But to make a ""bad"" movie funny you must actually have some finesse. And this movie doesn't have any of that. It tries to be funny in a stereotypically male fashion with grunts, lame jokes, extreme violence and dreadful portrayal of women. The only strong female character merely functions as an unattainable object for the others to project their sexual desires upon. With all the men in heat I'm surprised she didn't get raped?! The other women are either cheaters or weak women who tries but cannot fire a gun properly (like any man can).<br/><br/>The whole idea behind this series is for old action movie stars to come together and have some fun. I somewhat enjoyed the first movie which was more successful. Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay for both movies and also directed the first movie which might point the finger to the problem - director Simon West who fails to create anything coherent out of the script. The characters move from place to place where they instantly kill everyone and then move on. In between you get stale dialogue and poor attempts at humor and character interplay. Even the action isn't funny. While other movies have exciting action scenes that are well choreographed here it's just murder and mayhem.<br/><br/>Now take ""Die hard"" for example. Even though it's extremely unrealistic it's also smart. I was drawn into that movie and I believed everything that happened. ""The Expendables"" is unrealistic and hopelessly stupid. It doesn't take a soldier to realize these guys couldn't make it as guns for hire. They're supposed to be the toughest and most capable - and sure they're successful! But they escape from tight spots by deliberately RUNNING INTO THE LINE OF FIRE. When the bad guys run into another room they RUN AFTER THEM. Without care! In case the bad guys unbeknownst to the heroes were waiting to kill them they would miraculously refrain from running. Makes sense?<br/><br/>Sometimes I feel like there could be something there. Sylvester Stallone have the most lines and some of them are borderline funny. His character is the most interesting one. Too bad he gets so much screen time that by the end he just bores me. He's the best actor in this movie but he's not THAT good. And how many times can Arnold Schwarzenegger jokingly say ""I'll be back""? Seriously? I want to punch him in the face.<br/><br/>By the way it seems there will be a third movie. God help us all."

","While I did enjoyed the first installment, in what seems to be on it's way to become a long living franchise. I must say that the sequel was utterly disappointing. Knowing what I got my self into I didn't expect Oscar-dialog but I did expect something better than this. It feels like the whole cast didn't learn their lines but just read them from a teleprompter during the shoot. And the action scenes just seems cheaper and...hmm...no cheap is the right words. BUT...the worst thing about it is....the sound. Oh my freaking god is it bad! What the hell did they do? Record the sound with an old mono cassette recorder? It is embarrassing... I'm sure there's going to be a third one and I hope they put a bit more of an effort in to it. The idea is as good as any dumb Hollywood concept so why not make it a good one."

","Welcome all the IMDb users.As this is my first movie review on this site, i have picked up an ease sheep to slain. Do excuse my cowardice. The sheep in question...is The Expendables 2.I had the pleasure to view and quickly forget the first entry and wont be coming back that road again, but high ratings of the second entry made me bit curious, so i gave it a go. Big mistake.<br/><br/>First i need to state that although i do not feel that way, i am probably an intellectual.Like to disguise this fact by viewing some movies for their pure entertainment value.Guess the level of that one should fit into three starts this movie deserves. Maybe i am being too generous, since i would like to level down the high rating of this rubbish. Now...This movie can be watched once if you got nothing better to do with your life, although it exist for simple purpose...that is to give some thick pay check to some pensioners that are running short on elderly allowance.It is however an improvement to its first entry.Gone is shaky camera,bad language,cheap locations and chaotic action.It actually looks in the beginning, that it might be fun.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is sort f fun in brutal,life disregarding way,with few inside jokes /i did enjoy the funny lines sprayed on their cars...coming soon, knock knock./Silvester Stallone does look like having a prostate problem, trying hard to hold his urine for the period of longer shots,with a bad wig and cardiovascular coronation and everything. The rest of the cast is sadly left behind in most scenes,Jet Li disappears after fun scene with frying pens for the rest of the movie.And the person being saved at the end is no other than BIG Arnie /Yes he is back and we'll be reminded of that several times during the movie/and yes it is kind of embarrassing.But this is a pointless fun movie, so lets not dwell on details and move on. After forgettable plot exposition and many minutes later,we meet this movie Villain. Jean Claude Van Damme. <br/><br/>Now although most of these 80's dinosauruses looks like they have been through lots of punches in their times and need retirement...he as the villain holds a steady ground and stands up as a character and not an caricature. Hemsworth brother Liam is also likable character,but is expanded in a memorable way and gone of sight too soon.The heroine and romance /?/interest is also quite flat and implausible fighter...but so is most of this plots action. Well we are not here to think.Lets be fair and state that most characters get at least one scene worth of their appearance. But some of them do stand up and deserve more. Dolph Lundgren was the best and should get a chance as a lead role again somewhere. Jason Statham fight scene in the church.Bruce Willis fires few shots too.Also Chuck Norris makes good parody of himself in over the top scene, that is actually funny as it is ridiculous and him being the oldest of the bunch, appears as the freshest of the lot.But the boredom gap between exposition and final Battle is wide and numbing.Gives one lots of time for laughing at impossible plot development /A huge 5 tons plutonium mine with trams and everything,being dig by handful of villagers, whilst their estranged wives sit at home,learning to speak fluent English...and country government does not even notice/<br/><br/>Anyway...all gets saved by one man Commando Arnie,that does look like a bad waxwork of himself that really should have stay in the museum as the rest of all.As lines and shot references /death man going through the x-ray scanner=Total recall/ grows every so repetitive and self serving.Final shoot them all sequence goes way beyond of all that. Suddenly we are watching a parody of our once beloved action heroes...actually acted by them...an expensive joke if you ask me.But maybe i got it all wrong and this is a parody and not a serious action movie and maybe i should stick with Bunuel and avoid movie like this.I am sure there are many kids that will find this movie revolutionary and simple folks find it mind blowing and i should join these guys in the museum...who knows, i need to let you people to judge for yourself.Thank you..."

","Overall I was disappointed in this film, considering the huge number of stars on this I thought this will be an action packed thriller but in general it seems to be more of a film created to show each persons individual traits capabilities. Even the shooting/action scenes are not realistic for example you have many ""bad guys"" shooting a vastly out numbered good guy bunch but none of the bullets hit and make considerable damage, when the good guy fires it hits. In the end I made up my mind that this is s comedy and watched it.<br/><br/>Action wise there is plenty of action scenes on this film, but I thought it could have been more brutal and violent. The story also should have been richer."

Script was weak and also the level of acting is poor. Most of them are over aged than the requirement of the role. Only thing which force me to watch this is its cast, its reality nobody can ignore this movie having this big cast but this is sort of movie which you watch once and then forgets.

","Really? OK.OK. - First: Simon West should never ever (NEVER EVER) direct a movie again (not even Murder she wrote) The Movie is not completely bad, but it tries so hard to be. Its a solid action-film most of the time. Stallones facial hair works against that and so does the poor cgi-effects - but still solid. Schwarzenegger, Willis and Norris (especially) make it really hard to watch without being really ashamed of my generation. How is it possible, that Van Damme is the best actor in this. Not even Lundgren is as bad as the great heroes of action cinema. the story is bad but that doesn't matter - it could have been a decent action-film but Arnie, Bruce and Chuck work so hard against it - its a shame. I'm from Austria and my English isn't really good but i was so full of anger that I had to write this!<br/><br/>... and, please, keep Simon West away from anything that got to do with a camera, actors or anything near to film ...

"akibas83","Null","0","1","27 September 2012"," Below Expectations
","No doubt, from an action point of view, it was as explosive as it could get. Most of the action scenes are breathtaking. However, this is one of those movies that you walk out at the end feeling something didn't go right. The kind of feeling that only you know, yet your friends are like 'That was a great movie'. So at the risk of being a spoiler by saying something you keep it to yourself. Several things stand out. 1. Taking nothing away from JCVD's performance (he was great as a villain and so aptly named), there were just too many notable good guys against JCVD's Villain that from the onset it was a no contest. Undeniably, Stallone-JCVD match-up was a masterstroke (before Expendables 2 I had never imagined the two facing off), only i wish it happened in the early 90's. 2. Jason Statham needed a star who could go head-to-head with him - cue Snipes (barring legal issues). That match-up alone could have added a few more millions. Didn't someone pass a note to the casting guys that Mark Dacascos might probably give up cooking to face-off with Statham? Scott Adkins is OK but you would expect the antagonist to match the protagonist as he is not much recognized internationally 3. The good guys relied too much on firepower. Where is the old fashioned hand-to-hand? Dolph Lundgren never really had to break a sweat (Steven Segal would have been a formidable match). We all know Chuck Norris never had a problem taking it to the bad guys. With all those big guys - Terry Crews and Randy Couture - (and fairly younger than... take a pick) we needed a guy of brute strength (Commando, Rambo..?) to spice it up. I am yet to forget Bruce Willis shiny with camouflage (Tears of the Sun) and barking orders yet leading from the front - not the tired looking Church. Arnie should have been cast as president/ politician of a fictitious Eastern European country intending to buy the plutonium and threaten to annihilate 'Califorrnia' 3. Such a cast definitely needed more than 103 minutes but it would have become too long. So why not share them out equally in terms of star power for a more interesting final fight? Or rather, to keep moviegoers yearning for the next installment don't cram everyone in but give some a cameo, say in an airport and make a reference to a next time to keep us guessing. 4. Though it was intended for comedic relief, the dialog came of as over-rehearsed or trying too hard to make references. Overall, it was entertaining to watch stars of yesteryears show today's action stars how to blow up things and mow down bad guys with arrogance and nonchalance coupled with dry humor - qualities of the archetypal all-action hero that is lacking today (except maybe The Rock... Vin Diesel where are you?)"
"MarcusJ13","6","0","4","18 September 2012"," More of the same
","The Expendables 2 is a film that knows what is required of it but its problems lie not with being bad per Se but with how it has been written. It starts out playing it completely straight and to be fair it pulls it off slightly. It is fun to watch and at the same time tries to somewhat build a story even if its in a very ridiculous sense. The team go for what should be an easy paycheck but get more than they bargained for when one of their team dies. All of the cast are back save for Jet Li who despite what the marketing says is used to only a very small degree. Apart from this though Sylvester Stallone does at least attempt to enhance the film into having an ensemble cast save for the climax. All of them do what is expected but in my view Dolph Lundgren steals the show with a humorous performance. There is a shed load of action which is a great deal of fun and does triumph at times. To the film's credit it does not attempt to shy away from what it was always meant to be and delivers an enormous amount of action and of course one liners, etc. The problems with the film though lie in the fact that it can't decide whether or not it wants to be satirical, with some especially cringe worthy but amusing lines being used to this effect. It is almost like it is deciding it wants to take a heavy handed satirical touch late on in the film. It it however quite a lot of fun and is worth a watch, you will absolutely know what you are in for though when you see the film."

","I really envy those who enjoyed this more than me. I'm being serious, because most of the jokes didn't work for me. If you watch a movie like that (especially after the first movie introduced most characters to us), you know what you are up for. The first movie did have one particular scene (with Willis, Stallone and Schwarzenegger) that I thought was pretty funny. When some stars appear here and joke about their past (movies), some of the jokes just don't work for me. One of them has facts named after him and he recites one of those facts himself and it feels like torture (for me/the viewer).<br/><br/>But the action is shot well enough. Jean Claude van Damme obviously has a lot of fun with his role and he is one of the few who hold up their end of the bargain (again that's how I felt). Terry Crews and the rest ... of the (normal) crew should've been featured more in the movie. One of the best scenes being the Expendables talking about food in one scene. Stallone and Statham also have some neat talk scenes between them. This may sound ridiculous to some, but I do like humor that works in my action movie. So again, I'd love to like this more, but it's hits and misses. So while I did enjoy it in parts, I was expecting better."
"bhaveshbhatia","8","0","5","14 September 2012"," Packed with action scenes- the movie is worth watching!
","In the sequel to the previous edition of The Expendables, we see the cigar-chewing Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and his chosen gang of mercenaries romping around the world to finally take on the sadistic Jean Villain played by Jean-Claude Van Damme. <br/><br/>Couple of new faces that bring some freshness to the gang that was otherwise filled with ruthless looking aged people with muscles are Hemsworth, who essays the role of a young sniper Billy and Nan Yu ‚Äì only female assassin in a all-male mercenary squad ‚Äì who plays the character of Maggie. Coincidentally she was chosen to step into the shoes to Jet Li (Ying Yang) who retires in the beginning. <br/><br/>There are a few points that prevent The Expendables 2 from being an action lover's dream. Firstly, the movie is fast paced right from the start when we see the group going to rescue a Chinese Millionaire from Nepal by executing an excellent plan of action. <br/><br/>As the plot thickens, the quality and superiority of action that one expects from an action-packed movie of this kind starts to lag. This can be seen especially when scenes depicting hand-to-hand combat are executed. The movie also lacks some charismatic second leads and Stathom is under-used. The comic relief and the rivalry between Jason Statham and Mickey Rourke were missing. <br/><br/>Actually, the comic relief that was provided by Lee Christmas (who portrayed the picture of a lover boy who was heartbroken) was overshadowed by the humor provided by the trio of Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Chuck Norris.<br/><br/>Jean-Claude Van Damme comes to the party with all the required sniping and an I-don't-give-a-damn attitude towards all that was breathing. His only aim was to get his hands on the Plutonium. Director Simon West could have used more of his martial art skills rather than just sticking to the trademark round-house kicks in some scenes. Jean-Claude Van Damme could have been portrayed as a villain with a lot more physicality by making use of his fighting skills as compared to Eric Roberts (the bad guy from the previous installment). <br/><br/>While Expendables was all about larger-than-life guns, men with muscle and ready to fight and explosions, Expendables 2 tries to keep their fans close. References to Lundgren's chemical engineering past, Chuck Norris facts, Rambo, the Terminator and Die Hard all make their way in the film. This makes the dialogues anything but inspiring. We also get to see a dig being taken at Schwarzenegger's real life political aspirations. <br/><br/>Above all, The Expendables 2 will remain like the altar for the fans of action movies from the 80's and 90's. They will eagerly wait for the 3rd part to be released. However, Gen-X viewers might not wait as eagerly as their predecessors because they are not used to seeing actor‚Äîwho are no longer as fit as they used to be ‚Äì carrying out dare-devil stunts. <br/><br/>Lastly, the movie is worth watching with all its action packed scenes. However, as an observer, one might feel that the characters could have been made a bit more interesting. The fact that the film seems like a cartoon in some parts also does not look good to the eye."

Have you ever felt so reckless you left Dolph Lundgren in charge of a room of explosive chemicals? Well, the cast of The Expendables 2 feels all of these things and more in a sequel that is bigger, bloodier and ultimately more entertaining than its predecessor, but one that also suffers from many of the same faults.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone returns as Barney Ross, whose unpaid debt to Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) leads his team deep into enemy territory and the impending death-traps set by Jean-Claude Van Damme's Jean Villain (that's not a joke- that's actually his character's name). <br/><br/>In what is essentially an ensemble film, Stallone and Statham remain the two leads. Their high schoolish, give-and-take interplay is packed with clich√©s but grows as the film progresses, becoming inexplicably endearing by film's end. Speaking of pure cheese that just somehow works, Chuck Norris' introduction is about as uproarious as it gets- heads up: Chuck Norris tells a Chuck Norris joke- while The Governator makes the most of his screen time as well.<br/><br/>As the director of the first Expendables film, Stallone showed a solid grasp on the art of directing action, and although he is relegated simply to co-writer for the sequel, his filmic influence is perennially visible under the reigns of new contributor Simon West (Con Air, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider). Engaging and free-flowing visuals compliment the top-shelf combat choreography beautifully. Among the highlights are Jet Li's frying pan assault and Stallone's final face-off with Van Damme¬Öwho's still got it, by the way. <br/><br/>So thrilling, in fact, are the action set pieces that the thought that even one key member may go down doesn't even cross the mind. Everyone worth noting is fixed in two hour's worth of 'God Mode'. Simply put: nobody hits them, and they never miss. <br/><br/>Does that put a bit more strain on the suspension of disbelief? Sure. But it is all part of the action-comedy setting, and the one area in which the sequel excels. Aside from a couple of hideous attempts to develop fringe characters or exert hubris, the film never gets too preachy. It delivers on audience expectations, and the self-deprecating one-liners fired off like Arnie's endless supply of ammunition draw more than a few laughs. Hell, most of the unintentionally funny dialogue falls into the 'so-bad-it's-good' category, resulting in an abundance of quotable material. Still not convinced? Wait for Stallone's musings on the frailty of human life.<br/><br/>The Expendables 2 is still directionless. It still has a plot filled with MacGuffins and characters with a mountain of convenient outs in their backstory so obvious that what happens to each one should be a foregone conclusion by the fifteenth minute. Its villains are caked in black coats, bad sunglasses and even worse accents. It's likely to be forgotten halfway through a plate of post-film nachos, but the sheer enjoyment of the ride lingers like the playful curiosity of a half-remembered dream.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

Stallone gave the post of director Simon West, but continued to be responsible for the script. One can say: ""Old school is still alive!"" Without further ado, the creators went through the typical and ancient: the scope is wider effects steeper, more characters.

"kluseba","6","0","6","25 August 2012"," More of the same with some good and some bad points
","If you liked the first part of The Expandables franchise, you will also appreciate this follow-up but if you didn't like the first part, the chances are elevated that you won't adore the second strike, too. The story of the new movie is pretty much comparable to the first one, the action scenes are also quite similar and most of the characters of the first feature are back for good in this sequel.<br/><br/>Let's kick off with the negative aspects about this film first. Honestly said, the movie doesn't come as explosive as the first part as this one is even more predictable than the first feature film because of a quite parallel story line. Second, there are still some humorous moments in the movie but some one liners already start to be quite repetitive and feel a little bit too forced, old fashioned and used and that's why this movie has a lot less laughs than the first film. As a third point I must admit that I miss the aesthetic fights that Jet Li brought to the franchise as he has only a minor role in this movie and the combats are therefor rather limited, repetitive and only focused on brutality, effects and explosions. I might also add that I miss a truly good secondary role as Mickey Rourke was in the first movie.<br/><br/>On the positive side, I think that the story in here is still slightly more interesting as in the first movie. The locations in this film really exist and are much more intriguing as in the first part in my humble opinion and the makers of the franchise should even expand this concept in the future. Concerning the acting, I was positively surprised by the good work of Jean-Claude van Damme as main villain in this film. Usually, his acting is only focused on action and appears quite mediocre to me but he definitely does one of his best jobs ever in this flick. The fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis play a bigger role in this film is not only a positive thing for the gross, promotion and reputation of the movie but they bring back some good memories of the first part and their characters are as cool, funny and old school as in the first feature. The addition of Chuck Norris to this film also happened to be a good idea. His role is a little bit too short and honestly said filled with stereotypes but that's what people seem to want to see and his appearances turn out to be quite amusing, entertaining and memorable. The new characters in this movie played by the quite charismatic Liam Hemsworth and the tough but charming Yu Nan are interesting but first of all they are introduced in quite a hurry and lack of depth and then, they don't have a lot of screen time to fully convince.<br/><br/>After all, this movie is pretty much comparable to the first feature film and you simply get more of the same. The biggest plus points in here are the exotic locations and some new actors that appear and do a quite promising job. On the negative side, you have a very predictable story, less diversified fighting scenes and a lot less humour than in the first flick. Fans of the first part should not miss this flick but those who were sceptical about it surely won't get a better approach to this second flick and should simply stay away from it. This movie is maybe a little step down for the franchise but still on a quite comparable level in comparison to what Stallone and his men had put out two years ago."

","I would term the find that the 'sequel is better', as a crap.I couldn't find anything new apart from a mid-80's action flick. The first film in the series at least had a new cast and their unique job for us to get acquainted with. But the sequel leaves them nothing to do anew. But i could see a lot from the cast(Scott Adkins, Arnold,Jet Li) being wasted.The first part had a story to reveal as the movie goes on.But the plot unfolding in the sequel is too weak, and doesn't lend support to the cast, or for the viewing pleasure of the audience.Here is a gang of goons who stands ready to be massacred by 'revenge-ridden' heroes......"

","(minor spoilers only) With a body count in the hundreds, pretty much every action film script clich√©, and lots of explosions, the Expendables 2 has the virtue of giving action film fans what they expect. It also attempts some wry humour, from the Terminator cracks that appear every time Schwarzenegger does to the jokes about women who can't shoot straight. I'm not going to score it highly, though, because the sheer unreality of it all grates. Five guys can kill hundreds of armed men -- sometimes with unarmed combat -- with hardly a scratch? And why is it that the squirts of blood from those who have been shot are always in the same pattern, no matter where they are hit? Maybe I'm just getting old ... like The Expendables themselves, and I do have to give Stallone in particular credit for playing his part (and his age) to the hilt. (Literally ;->)"
"mm-39","6","0","5","22 August 2012"," Better and worse than Expendables 1
","Expendables 2 in some ways is better than Expendables 1, and in some ways worse. The Good : The story about the computer on the plane etc is a better storyline than expendables 1. There are better opening sequences in Expendables 2 then Expendables 1 with a surprise twist! I will not ruin the sequence in it by telling you. Arnold plays a bigger role in part 2 and clashes well with Sly. The Bad: There are too many action stars in the film, which dilutes the movie. All the actors have only cameo appearances, which hurts the movie's flow. In fact, Jet Li is cut out of the film early. I believe because of lack of film time there is not as much martial arts in Expendables 2 as compared to Expendables one. Expendables One had a better final fight scene, and a better bad guy because the movie's actors had more film time to work with their characters. Conclusion: Expendables 2 is more entertaining then Expendables 1, but the film's actors can shine like in the first movie. I give Expendables 2 a 6 or 7 out of ten."
"darrenmidgley","7","0","3","20 August 2012"," Good Film
","I liked this film, not sure if it is better than 1, but i think its a good series and hope there is a 3 tbh, it has tons of action, just what you would expect with this film and cast, Stallone, Arnie, Willis, Statham, Norris, Lundgren, Van Damme and the rest, the storyline not amazing but its an action film and has enough of a story to make a film. The acting is poor if we are honest, but like i said its action and does exactly what it says on the tin. And they try and bring a bit of comedy in with each others catchphrases and a 'chuck norris fact' :) In another note i would love to know how much they get paid because even though they are past their best, there is some very big names in this film, and the stunts, extras and props must mount up, i'm surprised the budget is 100 million."

","Expendables 2 instantly starts with one of the best movie openings I have seen in a long time. Stuff blowing up, heads popping, one-liners, and Jet Li smashing bad guys with a frying pan. After this we have an awesome appearance of Arnold Schwarzenegger which is followed up buy a boat and plane chase scene, with more explosions and violence. After this scene is finished we see the heroes escape and then the movie title pops up with the words Expendables 2. Unfortunately the action dies down for about 45 minutes of dialogue with the occasional action punch to the face or knife to the chest and this is the part of the movie that you take a nap in. when you wake up you will notice that Jet Li is replaced by Nan Yu, and Liam Hemsworth is no longer in the movie. This is were the movie falls short. The only character with any store was Liam Hemsworth, but they killed him off in that 45 mins of pointless dialogue, and Nan Yu is just a boring. By now you also tried of hearing there stupid nicknames and wish that they just used there actor names. This hole middle part of the movie should of been replaced with action and violence. After the wait we are rewarded with the Chuck Norris action scene, Jason Statham in a monk suit killing badies, and the return of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Now that the movie is back were ready for the last battle and it was epic. We finally have Chuck Norris, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Bruce Willis fighting evil people all in the same room well delivering awesome one-liners. There is even a scene were Willis and Schwarzenegger are in a Smart Car and shooting out of it. The ending is Sylvester Stallone's one-on-one with the bad guy leader. A few more jokes and a sad finishing scene. over all it was a good movie but nothing more. I hope for a sequel that is pure action with the only dialogue being one-liners. That would be the best movie ever!!!!!"

","The Expendables 2 reunites a cadre of action hero legends for another outing. This time the elite mercenaries known as the Expendables, led by Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) embark on a mission of revenge as they attempt of thwart terrorist Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme). But they're going to need more heroes so this time Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger), Church (Bruce Willis), and even Booker (Chuck Norris) join in.<br/><br/>Making good on the promise of the 2010 hit The Expendables, this sequel ups the ante in terms of carnage. Genre fans will be pleased by the near genocide of evil. There are bullet holes, explosions, blunt injuries, capitations, and even impalements which grant this movie its R rating. <br/><br/>Our legends are showing their mileage. The young guns, who are hovering around 40-50, get to jump, kick, dive, etc. The rest of the lot simply stand and shoot automatic rifles, with the exception of Stallone who absolutely must break a sweat in an effort to one-up the competition. For what it's worth, the action is far easier to comprehend this time as director Simon West goes for a more traditional presentation. That look carries it's own burden as The Expendables 2 appears outdated. There's no effort at slow motion or the intricate tracking shots that one expects out of a today's films. That the actors come from a different time doesn't mean the filmmaking techniques should¬Ö OK, the CGI helicopters aren't necessarily evocative of Commando.<br/><br/>The Expendables 2 seeks to rebel against the new hero standards which have caught the world on fire. In trying to defy the narrative set forth by the comic book adaptations, we have a series that touts real heroes but delivers cartoons. The Expendables 2 misses the opportunity to address the humanity in its non-superheroes. They don't feel the effects of aging‚Äîa better source for comedic material than the obvious resume shout-outs. Spider-Man is more realistic in how he juggles a secret life, sustains injury, and tries to win over the girl. Barney Ross could have in the least been teased over taking Centrum Silver."
"jan84","9","0","7","17 August 2012"," Excellent movie that had potential to be much better but it didn't happen
","Just got to see Expendables 2 on its first day here and dang i'm happy to say i liked it a lot and so seemed everyone else.<br/><br/>This move is completely different than anything that came out in the recent years cause the laughs and smiles and the great feeling it gave. <br/><br/>And then after analyzing it over this night i must say its far from perfect, Camera work is OK but feels so much that they rush through some scenes in the beginning and the action is generally a bit fuzzy and hard to concentrate on whats going. Maybe it would help if the movie was longer but who knows. Action feels to have a good grip on realism as guns run out of ammo and not every vehicle explodes when shot like they would have a ""michael bay syndrome"".<br/><br/>The cast of legends do a great job acting...hmm...themselves...with the right amount of humor and one liners. Overall feel is they are there to have fun and do a good relaxed acting and to transfer that fun to the theater, witch they accomplish with great success.<br/><br/>""Manual"" and computer generated effects are really excellent with an old school vibe and fit this move really well but sometimes like in the beginning they can get a bit silly (like the bridge explosion) and sometimes they fall a bit flat.<br/><br/>Like some 1980's action films this feels to capture the magical ""IT"" that made the first one so great and will leave you with a huge smile :) despite some scenes being way too short and rushed leaving people to want to see more."
