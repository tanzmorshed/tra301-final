"janmanuel2","5","896","1288","21 October 2018"," I liked it at first.
","I am between a 5 and a 6 on this. It was vastly overrated by the professional reviewers. I am sure their reviews were politically motivated. I loved the cast but I agree that characters were superficial and not defined as they should have been. I also feel more humor was needed in the movie. This can't compare to other Marvel movies. It's a one shot deal for us. We don't need to hear any more preaching."
"MR_Heraclius","7","87","121","21 February 2020"," Not the best ones of the Marvel package.... ! boring.
","'Black Panther' is a popcorn movie nothing more nothing less. Although It trys to grasp at the idea of western colonialism and racism, it only scratches the surface never really deciding were it stands. Although this has been championed as one of they greatest diverse films it is not and I would recommend you to check out '12 years a Slave' , 'Get Out' or 'Moonlight' who do a much better job than this meager attempt. The plot is by the numbers the direction is nothing special. Chadwick Boseman's acting is rather stilted and you can never attach to his character. Michael B Jordan is a one note villian who also struggles, phoning in a performance spouting monologues about messages that never really click. But where the movie really falls on its face is the third act which is cgi heavy and looks like its out of a video game. Black Panther by no means is terrible its below average and the concept of Wakanda is an excellent and well excuted idea. But this movie just needs to go that little bit deeper and seprate itself from the tired superhero formula."

","I went to see Black Panther along with my friends, and following the hype train we were excited to see it. However, following the showing we were all dissapointed by a mess of a movie with little plot and little thought which only served as a pit stop for infinity war.<br/><br/>The critics have vastly overrated this movie due to its groundbreaking cast, but the movie itself is not at all groundbreaking. Littered with all the boring Marvel clichÃ©s I have come to know and hate, such as their inability to kill off any hero's to add gravitas to their story, or the one dimensional villain who only exists for one movie so you know they will kill him off before the next, Black panther is also plagued by new problems no one but me seemed to notice. For example, the CGI was awful in the action scenes: whenever someone was even prodded, they would go flying across the screen in the most outlandish fashion, and the plot was torn straight out of the Lion King, as well as having the biggest waste of Martin Freeman since those Vodafone adverts.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe my dissapointment for this movie is fuelled by the marvel cinematic universe, as I feel sick of the movies they are pumping out like an industrial machine, as they all feel the same with little originality. I can only hope the bubble will burst sometime soon, and bring back true standalone movies which don't need a cinematic universe."

","This was supposed to be the newest and best Marvel movie. It was also supposed to be deeper than a super hero movie. Well, basically all they did was put African-Americans in the role of the main characters and followed the same exact formula of every other Marvel movie ever created. The action was mediocre at best. The villain was good, but at the point when he truly started to flesh out his character, I was bored and realized I was watching a movie. I literally said what was going to happen about 30 minutes before it happened. Now if you like super hero films, which I happen to not but if you do I am sure you will have fun and enjoy this film. But, in my opinion this movie had th intensity of a haircut and was a boring commercial to sell toys."
"c-murray631","1","1448","2423","15 February 2018"," Over-hyped - Not enough effort put into core aspects of a film
","With all the hype surrounding this movie (excellent trailers, Kendrick-curated soundtrack, all-African cast) I thought I was in for something special with Black Panther, as while they aren't remotely the highest quality movies, the Marvel cinematic universe movies are generally pretty entertaining. As it turns out I was wrong, Black Panther was extremely average, I have no idea what these critics/review bots are talking about when they say that it is the best Marvel movie and worthy of ""critical"" praise (as not just a super hero movie but as a movie in general.)<br/><br/>Things that I liked:
<ul><li>Effort put into aesthetic authenticity of the African elements of the movie - within the Marvel universe the look and feel of the movie was unique and you can tell care was taken in this regard.</li><li>Andy Serkis - My favorite character by far, was probably the only person who didnt seem like he was reading from a script sheet and got some genuine laughs out of me.</li></ul><br/><br/>Things that I didn't like:
<ul><li>The story was extremely predictable and to be honest I don't know if the most virtuous resolution was reached in the climax. Michael B Jordan's character had fairly reasonable intentions for wanting to kill the Black Panther and take his place in Wakanda as he had been abandoned, with seemingly no family, to live in the ghettos of Oakland. However, his whole plan to give advanced Wakandan weaponry to every African person in the world so they could kill and overthrow people in power who weren't African was extremely ""on-the-chin"" in terms of its narrative motivations within the current climate. It wasn't remotely clever or nuanced and really unbalanced his character, his motivations were understandable but his plan was moronic. Additionally, who didn't see Black Panther surviving his fall? Who didn't see the Gorilla tribe coming to the rescue at the end? The entire movie was so bland and predictable I wanted it to be over well before the end - I didn't even stay for the post credit scenes...</li><li>The acting was very wooden - Not a lot to say here really, some really poor line delivery from the cast across the board except for Andy Serkis. No one was particularly charismatic, the main character for instance was extremely boring.</li><li>The script was very robotic - This ties into the poor acting, but perhaps as a result of the script, some of the actors never really had a chance to bring their characters to life.</li><li>The characters - I have already addressed the mess that was Michael B Jordan's character Warmonger(?). Basically throughout the entire movie you never really learn anything or see anything of the Black Panther's character, he basically moves from one place to another showing no emotion and just either smashes things or asks people questions. Apparently the character is supposed to be very intelligent, while it was probably a narrative choice, the Black Panther in this movie seemed like an emotionless Jarhead whose only really characteristic was that he get nervous around his girlfriend... The women in this movie had a bit of attitude and charisma and shouldn't be blanketed down with the Black Panther and Warmonger as bad characters, but they didnt really get a chance to shine and really only contributed a few one liners and a bit of fighting.</li><li>The action - Shaky-cam rubbish, the action in the movie is terrible and not remotely on the level of the well-choreographed fighting in say Captain America Winter Soldier - please for the love of god show someone getting punched or kicked without having to cut the shot 5 times. There is an action sequence at the start which basically flagposted what the action was going to be like, it is shot at night and you basically cant see bloody anything...</li><li>The CGI - Honestly, the CGI in Black Panther felt extrmely overused and was surprisingly quite bad. It really took me out of some scenes because the environments and effects looked average (not quite Justice League bad but not far off). It is obvious in scenes in Wakanda, for instance, where the plains/mountains are in the background but they are clearly filming in front of a green screen. Some of the effects just looked silly and got laughs out of me and my party. I personally though the Rhinos were stupid...</li><li>The Soundtrack - After all the hype surrounding Kendrick Lamar curating a soundtrack for the movie, the tracks from that album barely feature at all. They faintly play from some cars and stuff here and there and a couple feature in some action scenes but I though we would be watching some decent action scenes with some bass heavy Kendrick blasting along to the fighting. Alas, no dice. The orchestral score is also quite average, coming in strong at weird moments and being quite out of place in certain places, there are a couple of moments where it seems like some sort of fairy, Harry Potter, Narnia music that just doesn't fit the scene.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall I think this is probably one of the weaker Marvel movies, avoiding honest criticism because of the hype surrounding it. The basic components of the film are all poor-average, with the only real 5+/10 aspect being the aesthetics of Wakanda and its people. Like I said above, I wanted to leave well before it was over because I knew the action was probably not going to improve from nauseating shaky-cam and I knew how it was all going to play out."

"jyri-soria","4","144","234","31 August 2018"," Unfortunate piece of cheap propaganda
","The movie is clearly trying to present an alternative to the classic white male super-hero movies/characters. A very laudable idea, but the implementation is so bad that it has the opposite effect. Furthermore, it focus so much in the racial topic that at some points it is almost racist with continuous stereotypes about black people being in a given way. If the director would be a white person, I would sue him for some of the things in the movie (black people acting like monkeys, jokes of them eating people, etc.). In this sense, if someone is interested in good movies that present strong characters from African background I rather recommend ""Hidden Figures"", ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" (sic.).<br/><br/>That regarding the social topics that the movie was supposed to cover. But that's not all. <br/><br/>The scrip is rubbish. After 5 minutes, one can imagine exactly what is going to happen. Most dialogues are such, that one knows the next sentence before the actor/actress has opened his/her mouth. The script is filled with cheap emotional sentences that seem taken from some fortune cookie. <br/><br/>Most actors and actresses in the movie try to speak with some short of Nigerian/Kenyan accent and the outcome is ridiculous. The movie even managed to produce a ridiculous character played by Martin Freeman.<br/><br/>The special effects of the movie are rather disappointing. Specially after movies like ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" and similar ones, I expected at least the minimum ""Marvel"" quality standards regarding special effects.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was also rather disappointing. <br/><br/>One good thing in the movie were some of the action scenes. The fighting choreographies are quite good. Also the car chases (surprise!) are pretty decent.<br/><br/>Another good point about the movie, is that if you happen to watch it with a funny group of friends then you might have ""cheap jokes"" for a month. In this sense (too), the movie falls into the category of Sharknado.<br/><br/>Watch at your own risk."

","I guess, because of the hype, I was expecting ""the best Marvel movie ever,"" or at least ""the best Marvel movie if the year.""<br/><br/>I pray to God and Stan Lee that this isn't the best Marvel Movie of 2018.<br/><br/>The fact is, there are maybe 3 laughs in the entire film. Three moments where you smile. Three moments where you crack a grin and they all come exclusively from Letitia Wright.<br/><br/>And it wasn't because there were jokes and they didn't land. It was really because the movie took itself far too seriously. Like Winter Soldier and Civil War it had a message to tell...but unlike the Captain American movies, it thought its message was so serious that it couldn't laugh even at itself.<br/><br/>I think, honestly, it even forgot it was a Marvel movie. In fact at time I think that the director, crew, and cast all thought that they were making ""Roots"" meets the new ""A Birth of a Nation""<br/><br/>And Martin Freedman, yeah I think he was only there to prove that he could do a better American accent than his Sherlock counterpart. Maybe it was a bet, which part of the cast of Sherlock can hold an American accent throughout an entire film?<br/><br/>And, honestly I am disappointed, because ALL three grins in the film went to Letitia Wright and Martin Freeman has some fairly decent comedic timing...they just didn't let it show. At least not for Freeman or ANYONE ELSE.<br/><br/>Honestly, I'm surprised they even let Letitia Wright makes us smile or entertain us an any way.<br/><br/>Honestly, it felt a lot like I was watching a college lecture...but a college lecture for a class that has a mandatory attendance policy and a professor that ONLY teaches from the book that he himself wrote...you get that kind of overly-serious pretentious feel to it.<br/><br/>And...really, how often do people have to tell other people who they are in this movie? That really happened far too often and not in the ""Bond, James Bond"" way but in the ""If I tell you who I am it's going to give me extra power"" kind of way.<br/><br/>And in the end you get two fight scenes by a waterfall that weren't very inspired and failed in comparison to other MCU fights. You get a car chase that was again...uninspired and fell flat but this time in the ""we've seen this before only done better"" kind of way. And a climatic battle that felt a little like the Gungan/Battle Droid battle in The Phantom Menace only with better CGI and an uninspired fight between the two powers rather than the Jedi dual.<br/><br/>At least Winter Soldier and Civil War allowed us to laugh and relax a bit during the more serious MCU fair. At least they pulled out the stops when it came to action and, despite the message...tried to deliver something, anything.<br/><br/>All this gave us was, well, a lecture and one where the action seemed, well, it seemed like the cast and crew felt they were obligated to give us that and thus did it with disdain.. It felt like all involved thought that entertainment would take away from the preaching.<br/><br/>And really, have a message....just please entertain me. I work hard. I already went to school. What I want for the price of admission is to be entertained.<br/><br/>If you can't do that, if you only let Letitia Wright make me smile and then only three times in a super hero movie that doesn't wow with action...then you've failed.<br/><br/>In fact, you've failed so much that you aren't ""the first Black super-hero movie"" I'm taking that pilfered title and giving it back to Blade...because at least Blade was entertaining."

","Seriously - WHY does Hollywood think that film lovers do NOT want characters to have a value?

They just assume that we will have feelings to any character who pops up in the movie - BUT WE DON'T. <br/><br/>If anyone fights, almost dies and in the end dies anyways we just do not care since we do not get to know the person. Forrest Whitaker acts is but off yet you do not care if he dies... WHO is he, tell us something about him before please (!).<br/><br/>Same thing goes for the rest. Seriously, a movie with 99% effects and 1% emotions is NOT a good balance.<br/><br/>AND WHY ARE ALL CHARACTERS 100% STEREOTYPE??<br/><br/>PS.

","If I were able to post a one or two word review, it would either be agenda or uncanny valley. Everything I feared this film would do, it did. Indeed in a couple of places it even referred to the (*spoilers*?) the slave trade! Seriously? In the 21st century you are going to refer at least twice in the same film to the slave trade - which BTW if you follow the film's premise would NOT have affected Wakanda as they were cut off from the rest of the world!<br/><br/>The main character of the film is T'Chala - a character so depressingly dour and serious, he could be a candidate for depression. You have his younger sister - who is CLEARLY being geared up as effectively riri from the comics - she WILL be the replacement for Tony Stark! To best describe her, she is a light hearted Q from thee James Bond films - I liked her, she was fun, lively, bright, as a character a real find.<br/><br/>Andy Serkis was excellent, but far too underused - Michael B Jordan's ""big bad""? I understand the anger, I don't get his ultimate goal - makes NO sense. The female bodyguards were the nearest thing to Mary sues in the movie. Really - beating up men TWICE their size with the SAME military background?<br/><br/>I MUST discuss the CGI. This is a MASSIVE problem.Sure Wakanda looks spectacular, but so did Asgard. It's the motion of the main characters that is the problem. It seems that whilst they can get stationary objects (buildings etc) virtually spot on now, the same can NOT be said for dynamic ones. If you have watched any of the trailers, you'll know what I mean when you see Black Panther do his somersault The dynamic CGI characters look crystal clear, whilst the real life objects have a faint blur to them. You can just see where the live action starts and the CGI ends. If the cars were CGI as well you wouldn't notice the difference so much, but it IS there, and because it seems 90% of this film is CGI, in the end it becomes very annoying.<br/><br/>as for the claim that this is unlike any other Marvel film - I beg to differ - unless you refer to how insular the whole film is, as it is based almost entirely in Wakanda. Which could be acceptable, until you realise most of the action took place outside of wakanda - in the remaining 5-10% of the film!<br/><br/>Winter Soldier was CONSIDERABLY better than this. Guardians was better and more fun! Avengers had greater scope.Ragnarok was funnier.<br/><br/>I know EXACTLY who this film was geared for, and it was NOT for your typical Marvel comic book movie fan. it had good points, The tech wiz sis has major potential, Wakanda looked spectacular (if you ignore the poor water animations (the ripples in the water looked cut and paste, watch MOANA for how water can be animated!) The soundtrack bore no relation to the action (action scenes sounded the same as the quiet moments!). But the worst ""crime"" was the agenda it pushed. There is NO Excuse for this, as they PROVED they can have strong storyline in Winter soldier.<br/><br/>So if you want a film with a dour dreary lead character, lots of uncanny valley moments, and LOTS AND LOTS OF POLITICAL GRANDSTANDING with no payoff, then this is the film for you!<br/><br/>Just remember The Godfather / Goodfellas / Star Wars / Schindler's List all barely broke 90%, yet THIS is supposed to be 100%! If you don't think the ratings for this are agenda driven, I've got a bridge to sell you!<br/><br/>I do NOT want a Black Panther 2 - I think the days of single super hero movies are done"

It's sad that our society cannot be honest about ratings due to fear of ostracization. Usually Marvel heroes use humor to charm the audience, but the Black Panther uses old, worn out cliched formulas.

And doesn't feature anything we haven't seen before. <br/><br/>What is most disappointing, is that it doesn't seem to tie into the Marvel continuity at all (apart from the unremarkable Everett Ross, who appeared from nowhere in Civil War and is a poor attempt to replace Agent Coulson). Like Wonder Woman, this is simply a ""Black Panther tale"" and you can take it or leave it when embarking on your next Marvel marathon.<br/><br/>I also found the advanced technology to be completely over the top. Weapons and armour, I can understand. Miracle healing and Panther suits concealed within necklace teeth is VERY hard to swallow indeed. Vibranium was an indestructible Alien metal that could absorb sound. Fair enough. Great material for weapons and armour. But spaceships and miracle healing? Really? Couldn't we have toned it down just a little?<br/><br/>I was bored. My friend was bored. After his wonderful debut in Civil War, this was a bit of a wasted opportunity."
"HorrorFlickFanatic","7","380","721","21 February 2018"," Good comic book movie, but professional critics overrated it
","My spidey BS sensors went off on high alert during the days before this film was released to theaters. The news and entertainment media began praising the movie, over and over and over. A 97% Rotten Tomatoes score was quoted often before the film had been released to general audiences. A really good film doesn't need to be praised by the entertainment community when it really is good. Word of mouth among general audiences will ramp up interest in the film. So I went to the theater to see for myself. My spidey senses were right. The professional critics overhyped this film exactly like they did The Last Jedi. Very likely for political reasons which really damages the credibility of review sites everytime they overhype a movie they want to push on to the public.<br/><br/>The film isn't extraordinary, but it isn't bad either. It does have high production value, much like any blockbuster sci-fi movie. To me, the film has a little bit of ""Revenge of the Sith"" (2005), a bit of James Bond 007, some John Carter (2012) and some Deadpool (2016). The African tribal council of Wakanda with the futuristic cityscape in the background was very reminiscent of the Jedi council on Coruscant in the Revenge of the Sith. T'Challa's sister has a little bit of ""Q"" from the bond films. She's the one with the laboratory filled with gadgets and Panther supersuits. Angela Bassett is like the tribe's matriarch Bond's ""M"" character in this film. The futuristic city and many of the flying crafts have a lot of similarities to the John Carter film of a few years ago. And the CGI fighting acrobatics over a car chase resembled the ones in Deadpool. The great battle during the climax near the end of the film resembles a war scene between two armies in Game of Thrones. <br/><br/>There is no denying this film has great visuals. More importantly I really feel the costume designer for this film deserves an Oscar for best costume designer. I absolutely loved all of the costumes in this film. The costumes were both African tribal and futuristic. It reminded me of Stargate Sci Fi films with their Egyption but futuristic costumes.<br/><br/>
Where I thought the film fell short was in character development and the screenplay. The actors weren't given a wide range of emotions to display. Most of the characters are either emotionally very stern and stoic, or angry. I felt the lack of variety in emotions got in the way of making the characters more human and approachable. Michael Jordan's American accent and demeanor sticks out like a sore thumb in a cast of well spoken and articulate african character. But physically, Jordan physique does look incredibly badass and tough in the film -- so that's a plus. I'm still wondering if the skin bumps on his torso were CGI or prosthetics.<br/><br/>What I didn't like was the infighting between the tribes and the blame game with western cultures. The film depicts a technically advanced society but with backward tribal strifes between each other. It just seem contradictory, but that's just my opinion. I do look forward to a sequel. But I hope the sequel has an external villain were the nation of Wakanda join together to fight a common enemy instead of more infighting between tribes. Next time, make a solid story first, then build the special effects around it instead of the other way around."

","This is my second attempt to review this title. 
I was able to see a screening of this in Europe...waste of time. Predictable and laughable at points, it desperately tries to keep pace with other Marvel offerings but fails miserably. The storyline begins with an extremely promising origin for the characters but instead of capitalizing on this and building on it we move to forced action sequences that are poorly done (horrible CGI). That's where the attempt to keep pace with other Marvel and DC offerings becomes obvious...cliché phrases and over the top reaches to create new ones. Some borrowing from previous Marvel ""technology"" really tried to claim it to it's own, but was sadly obvious. Jordan did an outstanding job portraying Erik Killmonger and Whitaker was great, as always...the rest of the cast fell miles short of bringing these characters to life. It's okay to act with a chip on your shoulder because THAT'S what make hero characters pop...BUT you must act first.

"NpMoviez","7","152","288","26 July 2018"," Overhyped but entertaining.
","Well, here's a movie that's hated by a number of people as a result of it being overhyped. It was fairly entertaining and decent. Just that it wasn't worth all the hype. The only thing it has to be a unique MCU film would be that it had was the majority of people from black community as its cast members. I am not criticizing that, but that's NOT a legit reason to hype it up so much.<br/><br/>Good.
It was whatever the first Thor movie couldn't be. In other words, it was ""Thor"" (2011) on Wakanda and better. It has some fantasy elements regarding the ""Black Panther formula"" and at the same time, it is quite of a sci fi too, and on the sideline it's also a crime film. These themes hold together very cohesively and make the movie a solid piece of art, on the whole. For the first time in an MCU movie, a villain was good. Killmonger is probably my second favorite MCU villain till date, the first one being Thanos. That character was well written to say the least. We knew where he was coming from, his motives, what he is up to and why. He is the best part of this movie. Many of the heist and crime film vibes it had was very interesting in the scenario they set up for this movie. The character interactions and the dynamic between various characters were good. Some funny scenes and dialogues land properly (while some don't, it's an MCU movie, after all). While watching this film, you won't want to skip any part of it, even though, in the end, you might be saying, ""is that it?! Dafuq?!!"" But most importantly, it gives you a really good introduction to Black Panther. We can get behind this hero for good. The character arc they give to him is excellent.<br/><br/>Mixed.
A lot of it feels like parts of Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. The ""sci fi"" part feels quite like the stuff going on between Batman and Fox. The establishment of the character of Killmonger was (in an undertone) similar to how we got introduced to The Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" or to Bane in ""The Dark Knight Rises"". Also, some scenes are quite similar to interrogation scenes of ""The Dark Knight"". I am not saying that it was a ripoff of Nolan's films. It might be the same in the source material they adapted, I don't know. But noticing those themes being dealt in a similar way, makes it kind of a mixed bag. The movie, also, apparently ""kills"" off a character, which doesn't feel so compelling because they were to be back in future films (which had already been announced or were seen in the trailer of Infinity War). Not saying that the way they killed off the character was bad. If we didn't know about him being back in Infinity War, it would've made a solid impact. But, we know about him being back. So, it wasn't much interesting.<br/><br/>Bad.
Many fights and scenes in the film are super clichéd. Not only that you can predict what will happen, you can even predict what kind of a dialogue will close that scene, and what will be the immediate consequence for the character who gave that piece of dialogue. The third act of the movie was just plain generic third act of a superhero movie with a lot of clichés and dumbed down ""Captain America: Civil War"" conditions with some of kind of ""Lord of the Rings"" vibe.<br/><br/>Conclusion.
""Black Panther"", for me, was some kind of a mixed bag. It was surely overhyped, but wasn't so bad of an overhyped movie. On the whole, a solid entertainer. Not something like Infinity War or Iron Man or Avengers or Civil War that will be talked for a long time.<br/><br/>Rating.

The Marvel machine already has a dedicated army of fans that support anything they make so they throw out the ""quality"" in lieu of ""quantity"", it's extremely disappointing when good things reverse their priorities like this.

I couldn't connect with any of the characters and as such cared little for their success or failure. Much of the hype I believe is due to the dominant African American cast. That's fine, when I watch a movie I don't care what colour people are, but in this case the hyper seems to have heavily depended on that fact and ignored more important aspects of a movie like storyline etc. The lead character was rather bland.

"kuarinofu","6","347","689","19 February 2018"," Wishful thinking / Broken ratings / Longread
","First, this movie has a lot of pointless scenes that achieve nothing, the museum scene with pointless covert operation ending up in killing everyone anyway, that's so not Silent Assassin. The 007 Bond casino scene was just there to establish the most worthless character in movie history - Everett K. Ross. <br/><br/>After the capture of Klaue (surprisingly surviving a horrible car crash), we get another pointless scene where Killmonger and his girlfriend re-capture Klaue just to kill him again for no reason. Killmonger never actually needed Klaue in the first place, so killing him was as pointless as freeing him out. Killmonger also kills his GF for no particular reason yet again. He could've easily get to Wakanda anyway since he has the royal tattoo (they also gave those to vampire servants in Blade). <br/><br/>Then Killmonger and Black Panther participate in previously established variety of local Mak'Gora (election process I guess). Black Panther fails miserably and the new stronger king takes the throne, the end, right? No. They actually want you to root for the most useless and impotent king ever. Killmonger then says something stupid about colonization and oppression, and decides to use the Vibranium weapons (produced solely by a 16 y.o. girl mastermind) to conquer the world. So he's like pro-anti-colonization or something, you tell me. Yet he is betrayed by his people (Okoye literally says she will stay loyal to the king and in 5 minutes betrays the new king) and they all happily participate in a civil war slaughter until Killmonger gets killed. Also love how they intercepted their own ships with their own people, just murdering them. <br/><br/>There was also some sort of brother betrayal, but it was so shallow and lacking motivation that it isn't really worth discussing. The brother (I think) wanted to have some more action and so he betrayed the king just to lower his weapons and suffer a life sentence afterwards. After slaughtering his own people, everything gets back to normal. And the king who solves all problems with violence decides to share his tech and knowledge to help the world. But not like the whole world, mostly African-american people in the US. I'm sure it's going to be pretty easy, since all technology in this world is done by one genius girl.<br/><br/>Then we get the first post-credit scene when BP visits the UN assembly and says that he is ready to share the knowledge with all the nations. I'm pretty sure that we already have a lot of knowledge on slaughtering each other in wars and even civil wars, so his knowledge is not going to make a great difference.<br/><br/>Summing it up, we get a weak impotent king to hold his throne. He never cared about anyone besides himself really, the fact that he suggests to heal Killmonger who killed Zuri just for lulz shows that he doesn't care. He never cares about his own people since he never hesitated on killing them personally. Just a little advice, if you wan't to have a good king character, ask Llane Wrynn how to rule.<br/><br/>Killmonger was driven by revenge at first, then his motivation turned into some uncertain political position about oppression, but in the end it seems that he just loved his country (but not the people, it seems). The scene where BP suggests that Killmonger can be saved and healed completely destroys all the rivalry and the motivation of both. <br/><br/>Anyway, Killmonger and Klaue were the best characters in the movie. The story was nonsense, they achieved nothing , BP leaned nothing and is still a worthless king and a bad leader. Was nice to see Serkis having a lot of fun in this movie, I love that guy and I'd love to see more of him (guess he's tired of playing CGI puppets...Gollum...Gollum).<br/><br/>I also loved all the wishful thinking in this movie, which is mostly based on the comic I guess. Advanced native African people with space technology saving the world? Any educated person would suggest you checking South Africa after 1994. Supporting the immigrants in the US? Come on, guys...<br/><br/>The good stuff: even though there were just 3 sets of Wakanda I still kinda loved it, the music choice was good, showing all that traditionalism, the nature. Killmonger's scene with his father was gold, I wish we had more dramatic scenes (it was well acted and well executed overall). The sister was kinda cool sometimes, being a more modern character and rejecting the old ways. Even though she's a little too much Mary Sue.<br/><br/>Yet the main reason why I still decided to write this is the reviews. This has to stop. And I'm not talking solely about RT 97% which is just ridiculous. It's like people are afraid to judge something impartially cause of getting shamed for being racist or something. <br/><br/>Also, this movie started with fair 7.1 on IMDB later to be loaded with >30% of 10 ratings eventually ending up in 7.9 (as of now, I'm sure it will only go up). I'm not saying that IMDB has something to do with this, but this rating surely does not reflect the quality of the movie.<br/><br/>Conclusion: don't trust ratings (nor RT or IMDB). If you like it - like it, if you don't - no need to be afraid to say that you didn't like it.<br/><br/>You know you've seen a good movie when you exit the theater with something changed inside, an emotion, a thought - BP is not such a movie."

","Ahhh here we go again, another Marvel film. And I know I'm probably going to annoy a lot of people but, this is my review and if people disagree good for them. Disappointing, great potential and I really, really wanted to like it but... I didn't. One of the most loved characters in the marvel universe butchered. In the comics T'Challa is portrayed as an intelligent and most importantly a serious character; however, if I were to meet him in real life I wouldn't have a clue what he'd be like, unlike almost any other marvel character such as Iron man, Captain America and even Ant Man etc. The protagonists in the film are undeveloped and this is most obvious when you compare them to the villains that are shown to have a political standing and given such a rich personality over everybody else, when the audience can relate and connect to the villains more so than the protagonists the audience can't drive and support for the good guys; like most other superhero films. Don't get me wrong the villains are shown as such but the lack of character from the protagonists leaves a sour taste is one's mouth, especially since black panther is such a great character in the marvel franchise. <br/><br/>I loved the concept of the film, Africa is a great place to branch out into a new franchise of superhero's as well as villains; with a rich and interesting culture so rarely used in all superhero's films. I was really engrossed and absorbed with Michael B Jordan's character ""Warmonger"" and his political beliefs, compared to the protagonists his point of view was relatable as he had experienced the outside world and been formed by it just like us he was an outsider who wished to be a part of this futuristic and successful culture. However, the film lacked to drive home why his political stance was wrong, and how T'Challa's new approach will further benefit the world; I mean buying up properties in less developed parts of California is great but it was never really made clear to the audience (I mean me, and people less-smarter than me) what this was for. And you'd think for a film with an age rating of 12A, with such strong political elements would make it coherent what his solution was. <br/><br/>Don't even get me started on the CGI, completely ridiculous and over used. Some elements were so unrealistic e.g. war rhinos who are able to target out their 'enemies', who are also meant to be their allies. if you've seen it think about it, weird right? One of the biggest things was the character T'Challa, who as I've mentioned is an amazing and really cool character, he is also rated to be sixth 'most intelligent' character in the marvel universe however on the big screen he was no-where near what he was meant to be, it was like he was a completely different character in the films; I don't want to sound like a comic book nerd, I love it when characters change in films but this is a completely new person with almost no similarities other than his name. I feel he didn't grow into a King instead he simply changed his political view which is a shame because why couldn't he do both. Worth a watch, but make your own opinion I mean I'm only a film student. Oh and who the hell cared when Forest Whitaker's character died because I certainly didn't, trying to make it like an important characters death, when actually we'd only seen him twice before."

","That's how important is was for me to explain my thoughts on this movie. <br/><br/>Super disappointed in this one. I say disappointed because I was really excited to see a great Super Hero movie with real Cultural cues. Unfortunately, that didn't happen.<br/><br/>Cultural Cues: MISSED
It wasn't clear if this movie was endorsing Black American culture or African culture. No, they are not one-in-the-same. The futuristic Wakanda has graffiti on the walls (American Street Art) as well as tribal African painting that is chipped (is it impossible for paint to stay fresh in Africa?) and there are street merchants selling hand-woven baskets (fits the ""tribal"" scene, but not exactly the advanced technology city they were trying to illustrate).<br/><br/>Music seemed odd and try-hard. In a movie celebrating black culture, I was expecting some amazing, compelling bass-heavy, Kendrick-themed action scenes. Instead, we got typical Super Hero theme music with a snare added to it. <br/><br/>Acting & Character Development: MOSTLY OK<br/><br/>Michael B Jordan gave an excellent, powerful performance as Killmonger. His physique was massive and he was extremely compelling in comparison to other movies I've seen him in. Unfortunately, as a villain, it wasn't clear if we were rooting for him or against him. His character definitely displayed Leadership and strength that T'Challa (Black Panther) was lacking. I kinda wanted Killmonger to change his ways and become the permanent leader.<br/><br/>Klaue, played by Serkis was also excellently well executed. But again, he was still pretty likable. No villain to hate means so protagonist to root for.<br/><br/>Jabari tribe... what? Seemed more like the black fraternity Omega Psi Phi with their barking and mindless (and unexplainable) barbarism in an advanced society<br/><br/>Storyline & Message: EXTREMELY CONFUSING<br/><br/>Is the motivation political, or revenge? Is colonization good or bad? Is this a black/african versus white movie, or a weak versus power movie? Why is the king of the country determined by the best fighter? Is Wakanda advanced, or tribal? both? Alien precious metal, but no Foreign Affairs policies? Is opening an outreach center in the ghetto really enough Social Responsibility initiative for the most advanced society ever?"

","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger<br/><br/>First off, I went into this film entirely objective (I didn't even watch the trailer). I am a huge fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and was hoping this film would be good.<br/><br/>The story is like any other superhero film story. The Wakanda aspect of the film is great. The technology used in the film is good. But there are a lot of clichés that kinda ruin the film.<br/><br/>The acting is okay. Chadwick Boseman performs the best. Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman, Danai Gurira, and Forest Whitaker perform below standard. Michael B. Jordan plays a generic and clichéd villain. He performs the worst.<br/><br/>The action if very good, but the films pacing is terrible. The film starts off fast but comes to a halt halfway through. The runtime is very overlong as well.<br/><br/>Pros: Chadwick Boseman's performance, good action, cool tech, and Wakanda<br/><br/>Cons: Generic storyline, okay acting, Michael B. Jordan as a generic villain, terrible pacing, and an overlong runtime.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 4.5<br/><br/>I really wanted this film to be good, but it felt like an overlong, clichéd, and dull film that was not needed in the MCU."

This is absolutely no where close and it's appalling it's being nominated that way. This should've been a Saturday morning movie for 12-year olds.

Michael B Jordan I hate to say it was sub par and overly dramatic even cringy at times.<br/><br/>Would not watch again, I'm afraid. Would forget this movie by next year.

"FabledGentleman","6","315","650","14 February 2018"," Great visuals, story delivers no surprises
","Well, i got to hand it to Marvel, though not always delivering great films, they manage to always stay on the right side of mediocre. I love the quality of their films, they more or less always look great, and in their films we constantly see great performances and witness memorable moments. But some of their films have stories and plots that can become somewhat predictable and washed down.<br/><br/>This is unfortunately the case with Black Panther, it is a really gorgeous film, and it has some good performances, but nothing like we saw in for example Thor Ragnarok, where Cate Blanchett and Jeff Goldblum delivered really memorable performances and are great villains, or Kurt Russel in Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2. This movie lacks a memorable villain like these.<br/><br/>But it's not Jordan's fault, he plays the part really well, and might be the one that delivers the best performance in the entire film. But the character he plays simply isn't all that interesting or deep, and combined with a plot that is quite predictable, there simply isn't all that much excitement to go around. No nerve in the core of the story, almost everything you expect will happen, does indeed happen.<br/><br/>But of course, the movie has it's moments, there are many scenes that are hands down great. And some action sequences are really well orchestrated, for example a long one shot action scene inside a casino, which was quite good. And there are plenty of short scenes that brings the giggles and puts a small break in the action scenes.<br/><br/>The strongest part of the film is the visuals, it's quite obvious this movie cost a lot of money, though DC managed to spend 300.000.000$ on Justice League, and that movie looks horrible. Maybe Marvel just know how to spend their money more efficiently. But i wished they could have come up with a better story for Wakanda, though they did manage to establish the soul of T'Challa, we now know him, his moral standpoints and his capabilities, which is exactly why i recommend you to see this film.<br/><br/>Though not by any means a perfect movie, far from it, it's still a worthy entry into the marvel universe, but don't expect any surprises, this is a straight forward film, but it's an important stepping stone before the majestic Infinity War enters theaters in about 2 months, which is not only the most expensive film ever made, but also the movie with most A list stars ever made. And it's nice to know all the character's that will face Thanos.<br/><br/>TL;DR - Great visuals, weak story, predictable plot, not very exiting villain.<br/><br/>6/10 - Fair"

Wakandans with alien technology 100s of years in advance to the rest of the world, but their still wearing animal-tooth necklaces and wielding spears? <br/><br/>And to top it all off, you see the Northern lights in central Africa!!<br/><br/>There is NOTHING realistic in the scenarios offered by the director or the producers for that matter.

None of the characters are interesting or memorable and just when some character building starts another ridiculous fight scene breaks out or the scene is cut for no apparent reason. It is the ""Battlefield Earth"" of superhero movies. A mediocre plot is destroyed by awful dialogue and delivery.

"leftistcritic","3","32","56","14 January 2019"," Terrible counterrevolutionary film
","I may be in the minority of critics on this movie, but it was a terrible movie. As you can see from my other reviews on here, there are certain superhero movies I like. But this was not one of them.<br/><br/>The main reason is its obvious counterrevolutionary message. The Killmonger wants to use the energy of Wakanda to spread revolution across the world, but T'Challa wants none of that so he literally allies with a white CIA movie to bring him down in what can be described as a bloody coup d'teat. The population of Wakanda are not important in this struggle among the ruling classes, and like in most coups, T'Challa gains power (after losing it to Killmonger in a pitched battle, leading him to come to power in a binding manner by their own traditions and not in a coup) in a bloody manner. You can cite the ""feminism"" of this movie or that it reflects on previous African history of kingdoms before European conquest. However, those women fighters are part of an elite royal class. Wakanda is not, in any way, shape or form a democracy. It is a monarchy protected by force and weird traditions (especially those that are hereditary). This film is filled with stereotypes of Black people including the poor ""helpless"" ones of Oakland, or the ""bad"" revolutionaries who actually want to do good.<br/><br/>For all the movies that have come out in recent years like Selma, Marshall, Blackkklansman (perhaps) and Sorry to Bother You, this movie falls short. I understand why people were drawn to see it, since it is the only major movie with Black superheroes, but it really was a lot of hype for not much of a result.<br/><br/>Of course like all other Marvel movies, thus ties into the broader Marvel Universe so white Hollywood producers can get more money. In this case it is worse than with other superhero movies due to this racial aspect.<br/><br/>I will not and will never recommend people watch this movie."

The ending speech that re-explains the plot is especially annoying.<br/><br/>There's a lot of inconsistencies.

He has no arc and has no flaws, unless you count being too humble and trusting. It's an incredibly boring character. I was actually rooting for the bad guy if only to make the film interesting. This is one of those weird films where the bad guys all have more personality and complex motivations than the good guys.<br/><br/>The royal family for first half of this movie is smug and unbearable, and for the second half are hypocrites defending a system they suddenly realize is horribly flawed, but only when it disadvantages them. But that is never explored. Their main motivation is revenge and to usurp the throne for the sake of ruling...exactly the motivation of the bad guy, except he actually has a nuanced backstory, charisma, and a philosophy he wants to put into practice."

The visuals are lackluster and the action is sub par for a Marvel movie but the biggest letdown is the boring story. I can't help but think critics and fans praised this because of political correctness of the first all black superhero cast. And there's nothing wrong with that.

The BP character was likeable, but there was nothing in the plot that made me really care about him. The obvious goal was to make BP into a character of Tony Stark level importance. Instead the film only hit Hawkeye level of importance. Aside from lacking character development, the plot just seemed slow and predictable. BP is easily my least favorite Marvel movie.

In general, this movie is fine, as I have stated earlier, but the truth is that the professional critics have judge this movie for the wrong reasons, they have let their political interests overshadow their ability to rate a movie the way it's supposed to be.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is completely overrated, also, definitely not the best movie of the year, not even in the top ten, not even the best movie of superheroes of this year and even though the academy nominated it for best picture it is still overrated. If you want to watch a really good superheroe movie and a really good movie in general I suggest The Dark Knight not Black panther."
"toophat82","1","21","35","29 April 2018"," Overrated due to politics both in and surrounding it.
","Aside from not being a good movie and like most marvel movies or tv shows today this movie is a clear example of how badly politics has infiltrated and influences hollywood and how bias and one sided it is. Now while on one note this was the one good thing about the movie since staying true to the source material is always a good thing on another note it also clearly and obviously points out the double standards within marvel movies too. As Marvel is clearly ok for some reason with sticking to the source material when it involves an all black wakanda but not when it's an all white Asgard for example or other superheros or villians from and with all white races, planets, and universes. Political correctness ia cancer!"

","In such a multicultural society like the United States, it would be surprising if, sooner or later, in the pages of the popular comic book does not appear the first black superhero capable of on a par with Spider-Man, Thor and Iron Man to resist the threat of danger, experiencing the Earth's defense strength. There was such a significant event in the summer of 1966, when in the 52nd issue of the ""Fantastic Four"" magazine, from the filing of Wall and Lee Kirby appeared the proud T'challa, Crown Prince of the fictional African country Wakanda. The emergence of the superhero with a characteristic color, traditionally incredible abilities and characteristic behavior could not get past the various ethnic groups in America and soon T'challa popularity reached unprecedented heights and rapid, then it without much thought in a row the team the Avengers. And in spite of the fact that the prince, and then the full-fledged ruler of Wakid, was only one of the knights of the image of the ""Black Panther"", it was T'chall who became associated with fans of graphic novels with this character who had a great future ahead of him. Having firmly established itself as its own personal series of comic books, T'challa appeared consistently in so-called crossovers and even managed to lead a charming Storm under the crown, who agreed to become the second half of such an outstanding personality. In addition to participating in various kinds of print adventures, the hero repeatedly appeared in animated sketches from Marvel, reminding the audience that he is unique and can not be written off. And in the early '90s, when the shooting process technology began to show an unprecedented rise itself Wesley Snipes tried to present themselves before us in the guise of the ""Black Panthers"", but constant creative differences and other production problems at the root hacked promising ideas. And yet in the depths of Marvel no one was going to give up the opportunity to transfer the history of T'Challa to big screens. Of course, it took much longer than Stan Lee planned, and yet the ""Black Panther"" merged into a harmonious series of screened characters of the publishing house and rightfully took the leading positions in the Kino-Universe supervised by Kevin Feigi.<br/><br/>Produced by Marvel for a long time tried to introduce T'challu an endless success story begun in Jon Favreau, ""Iron Man"", trying as gently as possible to bring to build a mythology movie, the universe for a meeting with an idol of the black community. And the best option was the invitation of T'Challa to the conflict, called the ""Civil War"". Friendly confrontation between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers gradually grew into by a serious, albeit not the most dramatic battle, and T'challa fully demonstrated its unique features, trying to avenge his father's untimely deceased in eternity. Played quite remarkable and not untalented actor Chadwick Bozeman character exuded confidence and unwavering despite the deep emotional conflicts tormenting his soul, managed to find a balance, thereby demonstrating the wisdom that came too early, but the world needs, more than ever before. In itself, the plot of the Civil War caused ambiguous feelings among Marvel fans, especially if we compare the scale of events in the movies with what was happening in the comics, but T'challa did not raise any doubts about the expediency of his appearance, and therefore Kevin Feigi gave the go-ahead on the shooting of the solo output of the ""Black Panther"" under the direction of Ryan Krugler, one of the most interesting directors with a dark complexion, who was obliged to feel with the history of T'challa kinship and show us previously unknown regions of the Movie Universe, to they are destined to play a significant role in the further development of the conflict under the sign of the ""Stones of Eternity"".
So, the plot of the film unfolds in a remote and closed African country Wakanda, which managed to reach unprecedented technological heights due to the myriad deposits of outlandish metal. Developing aside from the major world markets and, consequently, conflicts, Wakanda managed to preserve its identity and at the same time create an exemplary unity of the society in which conflicts start and are happening, but they can always be resolved by the affairs of honor. Entering the throne of a small but proud country, the young heir of the late King T'Chall (Bozeman) decides to continue the policy of isolating the Wakis for the benefit of their own people, never in need of anything, but events in the recent past compel the Black Panther to seriously reconsider their life position. The world was no longer as huge as it was some 10 years ago. Globalization, which picks up the Earth in a whirlpool of cosmic proportions, is also clinging to T'Challa's home, which among other things attracts scoundrels of various colors ready to sell their souls for the treasures and knowledge of the Wakid.<br/><br/>Contrary to the specific geographical location of the ""Black Panther"", it does not feel at all camera and alien. Ryan Krugler's ribbon fits perfectly into the framework of the Marvel Cinema-Universe, showing a charming and, of course, embellished African flavor for the joy of a few tired of the monotony of the previous series of films to the audience. The title character in the invariable performance of Chadwick Bozeman is revealed to us on the best side, demonstrating an excellent physical form and ability to win back emotions that make him a living person, not a schematic heroic character. The actor became the real property of the ""Black Panther"", he skillfully plays out even the most difficult by the standards of Marvel dramatic scenes and manages to joke so that he is not ashamed of him. Of course, by the will of the fate of T'Challa has no right to be merry to the bone, as his country is torn by a serious conflict, but the game of Bozeman takes the hero out of the walls of gloomy reflections and volitional actions in order to show the true humanity of the ""Black Panther"". Thus, T'challa becomes almost the most interesting character of Marvel since the days of Tony Stark, and although there is not so much eccentricity in him, the hero completely takes the niche taken by Kevin Feigi. And the history of the ""Black Panther"" is filed so competently that not only African-American viewers will be able to fall in love with it, but also a different category of viewers. And all because Ryan Krugler, Chadwick Bozeman and the unchallenged curator Kevin Feigi understand what they need to do. Certainly, the film has strong ethnic roots, only for a skilfully told story that in fact has nothing to do. Regardless of skin color, each of us has the concept of beauty. And the ""Black Panther"" is proof that a tightly-shot movie will always find attention and become a favorite for millions.<br/><br/>As a result, I want to say that the film by Ryan Krugler reveals wonderful beauties before us, reveals a serious layer of history, is not afraid of bold artistic decisions and at the same time gives Marvel audience a pleasant feeling of comfort. ""Black Panther"" is colorful, spectacular and epic. It does not violate the laws and stylistics of the Cinema-Universe, which also pleases. Of course, the authors would not be prevented from taking a partial example with the permissiveness of Taiki Vaitichi, the author of the third ""Torah"", but it is clear that Marvel is increasingly willing to trust the original vision of the directors and still give them the necessary sip of creative freedom. The Krugler tape is proof."

","I went to see this based on ratings and a friend's birthday request. Quick summary - numerous fight scenes, chases, terrible screenplay. Nothing unique about this movie. I was looking for a quick exit soon after the movie started and wishing I was home watching this on blue ray or DVD so I could fast forward through this mess and save a couple of hours of my life. I keep hearing ""Tribute to Africa"" in the media, viewers and critics alike. The movie backdrop was set in a fictional Africa. It was actually filmed mostly in Korea. So much for the tribute. There is no real life homage to the country, its culture and way of living now or in the past. As far as the superhero part, there is nothing the black panther does that is in any way unique. Superman can leap tall buildings, has superhuman strength, has xray vision, Spiderman has spidy senses and his webs to get around town with, Ironman...well Ironman is Ironman. Black panther just seems to able to jump short distances horizontally (not so much vertically) with a bullet proof suit on. Oh, he does have the gooey purple stuff that he drinks that is supposed to make him the BP but I really couldn't tell the difference with or without it. Ughhhh.<br/><br/>This was the worst I am not sure he really is a superhero of all the I am not sure he is a superhero movies I've ever seen. <br/><br/>PS. If you are new to theater 3D (vs documentaries filmed in real life) as I was - don't bother with the 3D version unless you at all have a choice. All the superimposed graphics of aircraft, backdrops, crowds of people, etc make it look terribly fake and the perspectives are all off.

","Black Panther, directed by Ryan Coogler, tells the story of the new King T'Challa of Wakanda who must learn to handle the responsibilities of this title. Chadwick Boseman reprises his role as the Black Panther and goes up against his nemesis Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan.<br/><br/>Pros:
Coogler has already proven himself to be an excellent director after movies like Fruitvale Station and Creed (both starring Jordan), but he showcases his full talents in Black Panther when given a huge budget to work with. The movie looks beautiful with bright lush colors. The soundtrack and musical score are also very good. At its heart, the movie's message is very profound and relevant to real world politics.<br/><br/>As expected, Boseman is awesome as T'Challa. His character goes through so much and his development throughout is handled perfectly. The best scenes of this movie are when he has to look within himself to find answers when the people he always trusted let him down. The cast in general has very good chemistry. T'Challa's relationship with his sister Shuri (Letiitia Wright) is very funny and it's easy to buy them as siblings. His relationship with his love Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) is even better. It would be criminal not to mention Danai Gurira and what she gives this movie from an action standpoint. Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger is without a doubt the best villain the MCU has presented so far. His motivations are so clear and his ideology directly challenges T'Challa's. He is physically and psychologically the perfect adversary for Black Panther. <br/><br/>Cons:
The pacing of the movie is a bit odd. It moves pretty quickly until everything comes to a head at the very end. More time should have been spent in between to flesh out the side characters and let the emotions sink in. In addition, the action scenes are not among Marvel's best. The last battle between Panther and Killmonger in particular is pretty disappointing in all honesty. The CGI felt unfinished and they could have been cut together better. <br/><br/>Overall, Black Panther is a triumph for the MCU and its societal connotations. This is, in my opinion, the best origin movie that Marvel has made because of its amazing hero, great cast of role characters, and truly menacing villain. <br/><br/>Black Panther gets an A."

Speaking of the MCU connection... THERE WAS NONE .
This sits as an island of CG phantasm to someone's ego and is NOT the Black Panther I knew well in Lee's fantasy realm of comic stories.
No background ever given to support the absurdist fantasyland, and no REAL story beyond...""We need help - Call this guy"" . THAT was the weakest part... No sustainable story line so it was hard for the characters to ever emotionally develop or connection.... just rubber suit flexing for 2 hours.
Expected so much more. That Guardians of the Galaxy is still rated King of all the MCU productions... not just in attendance and financial success.... but in pure Lee Production and being true to the Legendary MCU characters.

Technology is used very cheaply to get characters we are supposed to love out of sticky, impossible to survive situations and its really pathetic.<br/><br/>Typical, boring and overly political for a superhero movie

","I'd heard this movie was good and finally got around to watching it. When it was done I looked on IMDB and saw hundreds of 1 and 2 star reviews that I can only fathom were written by people who would hate anything with an almost entirely black cast that focused on a fictional or real African culture, or dislike seeing empowered women characters. Was it my favorite in the MCU? No. Are there people who give it 10 stars just because of the all black cast? Maybe. But 1 Star? Please. That's just Alt-Right spamming. It's a good contribution to the overarching MCU storyline. Worth watching."

Well, in all fairness, the way the Oscars are heading, in a ridiculousness path that is, it only makes sense that this one is nimonated for a best movie award. Oh wait! It's a mostly black cast, it has to be nominated, and if it does not win, it is racism!
Regarding the fake accents, thank God for those because they were the only thing of this movie that I will remember and laugh about. The funniest was Forest Whitaker..looooool "" blick panta"" lol.. or ""black printa""...loool

","First of all, I'm confused, who were the lead pairs? Because 99% of the cast delivered their dumbest acting ever! And the so called king & queen were most disappointing.
Second, the story! Phew! WTF was it - any of the scenes DO NOT lead to any conclusion at all. They are in Waganda, they go out to South Korea & they're back to Waganda. Instead of saving the world, the dumb people just fight with each other - to become king. 
Third - Who the hell is Black Panther? Any guy who can have the purple drink? What are his powers? Why is he called Panther, why not tiger or Cat or Girraffe? How come everyone in world is kind of Ok with BP?
Fourth - Why is everyone so dull? No energy except the negative characters and Okoye! Why aren't dialogues impactful instead of lengthy & boring?
Fifth - Why is technology overhyped? Making remarks like another broken white guy always showing that they're waaaaaayyy ahead from entire world. Why? It's neither used in Waganda nor outside. It's nowhere shown technology being used for their people.
Seventh - Connection? Where is it? Why are they crying talking about his dad but no conmexconn shown between them?<br/><br/>Eigth - Why the fuck is this movie over hyped? How come 7.9/10. Thor was 8/10. ""Thor!"" No comparison!! Are you fucking kidding me? People are giving bad reviews but 6/10 & 7/10. Why?

Its a movie about a fictional king in a fictional country. True Marvel fans will know that you can't tell the story of BP without the origins and practices of Wakanda. Anyway, Michael B. Jordan (No relation) plays the realest villain since Magneto. (Another character whose anger comes from a real place) Enjoyed Jordan in Creed and liked the character.

"sra_ajay","7","31","58","21 February 2018"," An evolving Black Panther review
","This is my first public movie review. So I will keep it 100 percent positive i.e. all things good. I want to start with positivity. It was a good movie. Solid 7/10.<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman, playing the protagonist King T'Challa/Black Panther, has nailed the parts of ""a good man"", ""king"" and ""warrior"". The Kingship, channeled through his acting, peaked in the scene where he raises his voice in front of the preceding black panthers (in 2nd limbo/dream/ other world sequence) to make a point, his point, a point to bring change, a point that challenges the orthodox thoughts of the preceding Kings/Black Panthers. That is the sequence when the audience learns that the King has arrived(BAM!!).
Killmonger, the antagonist , has also been acted very well. Michael B. Jordan, as Killmonger, brought a mean/maniacal/destroyer look to him, which was enhanced by the upper body scars created by the makeup department, each scar stood for a kill. (There may be a technical term for the scars, Please comment if you know). Martin Freeman's character could have been more explored, because to me his look was too similar to BBC Sherlock's Dr. Watson. I was getting confused as to why or what Dr. Watson was doing in Wakanda? (Watson-Wakanda, maybe there is some connection.)<br/><br/>There were multiple story arcs that were pondered upon in the film. The rise of a king, the revenge of an outcast (outcasted without his fault), a general's loyalty towards throne or the man sitting on the throne, a son dealing with demons created by his father and many more. On a personal note, I think the arc of Killmonger could have easily been taken to some other direction. His character has got such enriched background and history that so much more could have been done with his character.<br/><br/>The visual effects were superb. Scenes such as the entrance to Wakanda, the dreamland/limbo sequence, the Black panther cave, the Vibranium structured city stood out amongst many others.<br/><br/>Another uplifting thing about the movie was the comedy. The comedy that erupted between King brother and prodigy-scientist sister and between Dr.watson and Man-ape/M'Baku were the ones that stood out for me. I could narrate some of them in fresh fashion but I do not want to spoil the joke! So just watch it yourself.<br/><br/>Costume design in the movie is another area that must be applauded. The Black Panther's costume is like Deadpool's costume. There is nothing fake about it. You don't need to CGI it. You can put a jacked dude in that costume and you've got yourselves a Black panther, looking person. It just feels real. The vibrant costumes worn by all the cast such as Queen mother and different tribes and people of Wakanda had a fresh feel to it. The costume design was as unique as Wakanda is supposed to be.<br/><br/>Overall a good movie. Worth a watch in a theatre.<br/><br/>SUMMARY- A ""good MAN"" must become flexible in his/her ways if duties of ""a king"" are to be performed aptly."

"Asuka-Fan","1","14","23","10 March 2018"," Over-hyped and over-rated; movie makes no sense at all
","After 3 straight comedies (GotG2, SMH, and Ragna-joke), MCU tried to copy DCEU by making a serious movie. But if Black Panther is supposed to be a serious movie, then Black Panther is a HUGE FAIL because Black Panther doesn't make any sense at all.<br/><br/>1. T'Chaka flew his aircraft to a neighborhood in Oakland at the beginning and T'Challa did the same thing at the end. The US government wouldn't just allow a foreign aircraft to fly over US airspace (especially after 9/11) and hover over or land in a US city. So Wakanda violated US airspace.<br/><br/>2. T'Chaka tried to arrest his brother and take him back to Wakanda for execution. Even if his bother did break the law, he's on American soil and T'Chaka has no jurisdiction to arrest him on American soil. T'Chaka would have to request the US government arrest his brother and extradite him to Wakanda. But the reason T'Chaka didn't do that and instead tried to covertly take his brother back to Wakanda for execution is because T'Chaka was afraid his brother would request political asylum from the US government.<br/><br/>3. T'Chaka kills his brother and just leaves without taking his brother's body back and giving him a proper burial. Even if T'Chaka has diplomatic immunity, he just killed someone on American soil so by law he still needs to report that to the US authorities. Instead, T'Chaka just leaves his brother's dead body there for his young son to find. Imagine a young child finding his father's dead body like that!<br/><br/>4. Klaue was arrested on Korean soil. Why the hell would the Korean authorities allow an American CIA agent (basically an American spy) and a Wakanda national to question a suspect arrested on Korean soil?<br/><br/>5. Why would the Korean government allow T'Challa to take a wounded American spy to Wakanda? 1 MCU fan said that South Korea is on friendly terms with the US, but that's irrelevant. He's not only an American citizen but an American CIA agent. The US government might not want a wounded CIA agent transported to a country that Americans aren't even allowed to visit and potentially drugged or tortured to reveal state secrets.<br/><br/>6. Since T'Challa accepted Killonger's challenge and Killmonger defeated T'Challa in combat, Killmonger was the rightful King of Wakanda. So the American CIA agent was basically participating in an illegal coup against the rightful King of Wakanda when he helped T'Challa take back the throne. Shouldn't the rogue CIA agent call Langley first to check if he has permission from POTUS to participate in an illegal coup against the rightful King of a foreign nation and potentially involve the US in a war that POTUS might not want? After all, POTUS might prefer having a former American soldier on the throne of Wakanda.<br/><br/>7. If Wakanda had all that medical technology/process to heal people and save lives, then why did T'Challa just let Killmonger die when T'Challa could've saved him? Because Killmonger didn't want to be in prison? But why would Killmonger be in prison? Killmonger didn't break any of Wakanda's laws. Killmonger was the uncle's real biological son so Killmonger wasn't an imposter. Killmonger challenged T'Challa for the throne, which Killmonger had a legal right to do by Wakandan law, and T'Challa accepted. Killmonger defeated T'Challa in combat so Killmonger was the rightful King of Wakanda according to Wakandan law. And as the rightful King of Wakanda, Killmonger had the legal right by Wakandan law to order his army and his ships to go outside Wakanda and wage war. So what Wakandan law did Killmonger break? Why would Killmonger be put in prison when he didn't break any Wakandan laws? Is it just normal policy that the King of Wakanda can just throw anyone in a Wakandan jail just because they challenged the King?<br/><br/>8. If Wakanda is supposedly the most technologically advanced nation in the world, then why are they still resorting to a medieval and barbaric and savage ritual of choosing a leader by violence and bloodshed and mortal combat? Is no one in Wakanda smart enough to come up with a peaceful way in the 21st century to choose a leader that doesn't involve violence and bloodshed and mortal combat, especially when most of the rest of the world has already done so?<br/><br/>9. If Wakanda wanted their King to prove himself worthy to lead the nation, then why would decide their King by mortal combat? Wouldn't a supposedly technologically advanced nation want to choose a King who is the smartest rather than just choose a King who has the most brute strength?<br/><br/>Black Panther is just another over-hyped and over-rated MCU movie that is full of awful writing."

"latinfineart","2","110","234","19 March 2018"," A kids film - barely watchable for this adult
","Without a doubt this is a culturally important film, one with an important message to tell its audience. We learn that bad power leads to oppression, and good power leads to good oppression, but only if used properly and respectfully. Blind loyalty to a power structure keeps the system intact. Wakanda is, in essence, an African fantasy, one in which the continent is able to withstand white oppressors and consequentially has the power to build an empire off Vibranium, a natural resource that is more powerful than steel. And many of us enjoy seeing people of color on the big screen. After a century, Hollywood may be waking up to the fact that Black heroes are actually bankable. Surprise!<br/><br/>Wakanda is hidden behind clouds and mountains, and a fantasy rain forest canopy. But wait a minute. It is a sci fi film with advanced aircraft. Doesn't that mean the world possesses radar, and satellites? Well, then why have the clouds and rain forest kept this place such a secret for so long? DO NOT ask questions like these, of this film. If you are the kind of individual who can suspend your reason and intellect for two hours, and just watch, you may enjoy this. Personally, I felt alot of pain while watching this film. I might put it in the category of Lone Ranger, and Wild, Wild West. It really stank, as a story. <br/><br/>The capital is from the evils of white colonizers, but any sort of imagination is left in the back seat when it comes to this emerald city onscreen. It's a missed opportunity on the part of Coogler because, after all, this is an MCU movie set in Africa! I wanted to see the savannas and the fantastic natural sights and beauties that come with this fascinating and colorful continent, but instead, there's an over-reliance on fake digital backgrounds rather than real on-set locations. This is detrimental to bringing any kind of humane connection or absorbingly artful feeling to the film, which quite frequently feels artificial and computerized rather than lived-in and three-dimensional.<br/><br/>To sum it up, if you like comic book films, you may like this one. I do not like comic book films, and I really, really did not like this film."

","""Black Panther"" is the first Big Budget and Ensemble Cast Black Superhero/Comic Movie made in history. Despite all that was put into the production of this film, all audiences get is yet another Typical, Very Generic, and Over the top Cliched Superhero/Comic movie that has been shown and told hundreds of times before.<br/><br/>Despite the movie's extreme lack of originality, there is some entertainment to enjoy here. The World of the movie is not only good looking and interesting but very Sophisticated, the most ever seen in the Superhero film genre. There is a lot of ""Eye-Candy"" to see throughout the movie but it cannot cover up the lack of storytelling and ""Amateurish"" acting from a good cast of acting talent. From Costume design, to certain set pieces, make-up, etc. are well done, but are often ruined and spoiled due to Poor and Weak Visual effects work. If your expecting a Great Visual Effect Superhero Movie Spectacle prepare to be disappointed here. The CGI is very noticeable and often times characters and objects look like Cartoons. In addition, the choreography in the action and fight scenes are slow and obvious, looking like actors in Theater Rehearsals waiting for their cues. <br/><br/>Furthermore, The performances are good, Chadwick Boseman and Letitia Wright stand out the most overall, including the acting chemistry between the two of them. The weakest and worst of the bunch are Micheal B. Jordan and Martin Freeman as both their characters were not only generic, but extremely Dull. Martin Freeman's ""Everett K. Ross"" was meaningless, had no real purpose to be involved in the narrative at all, and add Michael B. Jordan's ""Killmonger"" to the List of Forgettable Villains, which has become a consistent trend in Marvel Studio movies over the recent years. Others such as Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis's characters perform well with what they were working with, but both have limited screen time to help really benefit the film's narrative at all. <br/><br/>Finally, ""Black Panther"" is a Comic/Superhero movie that stays true to it's guns from beginning to end. It doesn't deviate from it's tone and story arc unlock most Marvel Studios movies always do. On a personal note, it's good to finally get another Marvel Studios movie that focuses on it's Title Character instead of a Superhero movie that follows multiple characters and story arcs at the same time that are pointless with no meaning to the Main Title's Protagonist. <br/><br/>Overall, ""Black Panther"" may be another forgettable Superhero Movie, but it is a decent addition to the Comic Book Superhero Genre, including to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."

The special effects where good, but I feel that's all it had going for it and I would have liked to see Michael B. Jordan beat Black Panther, I would prefer him King over T'Challa.<br/><br/>The only good Marvel movies are Thor, Iron Man, Dr Strange and Avengers, the rest...Meh! Black Panther, Ant Man and Captain America have too similar plots in context and rely too much on CGI. So Does iron Man but RDJ has the persona to make most people like it.

","First of all, I'm glad that great ratings are continuing to climb on this film despite the phony low reviews that have been given here. My experience after watching it twice and also planning watching a third time, believe the hype.<br/><br/>Ryan Coogler does an excellent job and the actors are incredible. He knows who his strong actors are and they deliver 110%. He made Michael B. Jordan's role as Killmonger so complex that you didn't know whether to dislike him or be on his side despite how menacing he was. I cannot wait to see him in Creed 2 so I can be reminded it that he really is a good person lol!<br/><br/>This movie doesn't really show heavy action for Black Panther (you get that intro in Civil War) but it introduces you more to how he operates as the new king, and the choices he will have to make. However, leaves you satisfied just the same.<br/><br/>Ludwig Gorranson who does an excellent job with the music score, is no stranger when it comes to working with Ryan, as he has worked with him in Fruitvale Station and Creed. The music score is a character within itself, as they literally speak for Black Panther/T'Challa and Killmonger during their quiet moments. The research and tours with these excellent musicians during his visits to so many countries in Africa really showed, and I understand why Coogler likes working with him.<br/><br/>I do hope people do not fall for these bad reviews which are obviously there to try to scare people away.

In case you didn't know it: Disney did not create the Black Panther, nope, they bought him (comparison to historical evils is intentional) and milked him for all he's worth. To make matters worse, if you are old enough to remember, the character was created in precisely the opposite spirit of this trite, overly-politicized nonsense. There are some decent performances, but otherwise this film is devoid of any merit whatsoever, even within the context of the MCU.

","I'm from Asia and I don't understand the discrimination and racial crisis of Blacks and Whites in US. So I went to see the movie expecting it to be another good movie from MCU ( you have to admit they do have a good track record). And what I got instead was pure gold. 
I have never seen Africa and African culture depicted in such a beautiful way in a live action movie. Hollywood movies always paint Africa in colors that matches its name under British colonization, ""The Dark Continent"". We see movies of slave trade, blood soaked diamond industry, starvation and poverty. I've always wondered this can't be all that Africa has to offer. Though it is based in a mythical country and superpowers, it gave us a glimmer of what Africa would have looked like if European and middle eastern invaders sucked it dry of it's resources. In black panther we see a world set in Africa with bare minimal of those usual stereotypes about the continent. It is a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>The splash of color was a balm to the eyes and music, well i might need to write another review about how good music in this movie was. The end credits score for the movie was phenomenal.
Every character had his\her moment to shine. And all the actors did their characters justice. Black Panther's little sister Shuri was a delight to watch. Micheal B Jordan as the Killmonger was exceptional and up their with Loki when it comes to Marvel villains."
"mrjtmason","10","108","234","20 February 2018"," Worth the hype!
","I have to say, after all the hoopla (which I was growing tired of), Black Panther ranks for me as one of the best action movies of all time, 2nd only to Return of the Jedi (don't judge me), and even one of the best dramas. Was surprised by so much of this sort of ""anti-hype"" criticism. I believe some used to the typical super hero flick of Today, simply want pulse-pounding action every minute, with a few wise-cracks thrown in, and maybe half-decent lines delivered. This is different, and that old formula is so tired and played at this point in the MCU. This story, the special effects, the intrigue, and the action were all superb. However, what was truly phenomenal was the acting by such a massive cast. This just doesn't happen in action, let alone super hero flicks, even today. Those who refuse to see it for the racial reason or know people like that. Tell them it really is just that good beyond the racial make-up, then tell them a White hero actually figures prominently in the end, so don't fret... ;-)"

However, after watching Black Panther, I think I have a little hope for movies restored in me. Without going into it, the story line was easy to follow, easy enough for kids and complex enough for adults to ponder as well. The acting from every single cast member was great, Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, and Danai Guirira stole the damn show. Danai Gurira's character (Okoye), I think stole the fight scenes, and I wasn't mad about it. The fight scenes were great, really took me back to the glory days of movies (without too much CGI). You definitely get character growth and development in this movie. Kudos to the director and cast for putting 100% authenticity into this movie.

I could not sit thru Black Panther again as it had very few actual action set pieces. The car chase was by far the best scene in the movie but sadly that was pretty much the climax of the film. The ""BIG"" action set piece was just boring with a clichÃ© army set to fight itself because the kid with a chip on his shoulder his whole life makes his way back into the tribe. I also found the main Black Panther fight amongst the bad/good guy also boring. I could easily watch Iron Man again over this and Man of Steel. The story line is so dang simple but yet dragged out for a long time because the bad guy at first isn't really the bad, bad... guy. I found myself wishing I had watched the origin of the 1990 Black Panther instead which they hinted upon in the beginning as I think that would have been far more interesting but it wouldn't actual put BP into the new Avengers films. It just doesn't make much sense that they were fighting Ultron but BP was no where to be seen even though they seem to know everything that is going on...

","Yes, it has its own political orientation. Yes, you have seen parts of this movie before. Yes, there is a whole lot of CGI in this film. If you like Superhero movies (and I'm underwhelmed by most of them), you'll probably like Black Panther.<br/><br/>The cast is first rate and pulls it off. I liked the leader of the Gorilla tribe and his devotional praise of Hanuman, even if that particular mythological figure is more Indian than African. It was still a clever touch, and hopefully some schoolkid somewhere does his proverbial homework and looks that name up.<br/><br/>The visuals are generally good if not a little derivative of movies like Thor, The Avengers, or maybe even Star Wars: Episode One at the end. There's a lot of Wonderwoman, Batman, and even some Casino Royale thrown into the script. there's maybe even a passive resemblance to Elysium in some of this movie's themes. I feel like I've seen massive underground mines/dwellings in a lot of films over the years. However, the more movies you see, the more you see them in other movies. Eventually age catches up with all of us, and our taste in films sadly is not spared the blunting of memory to dilute the sensuous new. Alas, this movie is definitely made for children and teens.<br/><br/>Yes, the film is not perfect. Klaue dies way to early, much like another recent Andy Serkis character which will not be named here. I wish that the MCU would start using more practical effects in lieu of the expansive CGI that permeates these films. Christopher Nolan and Ridley Scott need to give these Feige and company a few pointers. I could have done without some of the Urban Street art that permeates the imagery of the film, especially in the lab and Wakandan street scenes. It just seemed out of place here to me but, overall, the artistic conception of this film is pretty solid. <br/><br/>In the end, it's a comic book movie and you'll ether like it or you won't. I liked it"

Choosing leaders that way is so anachronistic as to be laughable and clearly is not part of a society that can help anyone, let alone themselves. The writers clearly have no knowledge of history or anthropology. Then, also, the actions of most of the male main characters being largely based on irrational and emotional responses does not lend itself to a stable society.

Each actor gives a fake African accent that is beyond forced. The narrative is nothing new or extraordinary, it's recycled and boring. Few films have such poor writing as this one, each scene having cringe-worthy dialogue that weakens everybody's acting. Michael B. Jordan especially gives a terrible performance, one of the worst actors we have around. The film looks like an old video game too, the production and costumes horrendously bad.

Chadwick Boseman, Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o where especially bland. Found myself hoping they would be killed off by the end.<br/><br/>Plot was the same as every other heroes quest plot. Except with less (zero) hero development. I've seen Roger Ramjet and Banana Man episodes with more hero development than the entire movie. Not even close to Marvel's lowest standards.<br/><br/>Same for the villain. He was more vanilla than villain. Although he just barely had more character than the Hero.<br/><br/>Fight scenes where dull, poorly motivated, poorly filmed and had little reason or logic. for the 40% where I could see what was going on I was mostly wondering why it was going on and why they weren't trying harder. I've seen better action filmed with a vibrating phone and posted to youtube with the wrong aspect ratio.<br/><br/>CGI was horrible and glaringly obvious so much so they actually had special sound effects to warn you that the cgi was happening. Sound effects also had bad computer generated sound. Like 80's video games had a love child with 80's synth. The Black Panther suit was especially bad, Looked some kind of bulletproof hologram. Which could have been cool if thats what they where going for.<br/><br/>Picture quality was really bad. I watched on a V-Max screen. It was very blurry. Not sure if this was just the cinema or if its the source material. Seemed to be worse in some places than others so likely the cinematography.
 Fight scenes where shaky and poorly framed, Futuristic city was out of scene, blurry and not very futuristic or believable. Looked like someone over polished a generic USA city and badly photo-shopped into India, not Africa. Except they still had bad (American) graffiti tags in the background. Was all shiny metal from a distance then grafiti concrete when up close... Overall was very confusing, not sure if futuristic slum was the angle or if was simply edited by a blind person who was so drunk they forgot half the cgi backgrounds.<br/><br/>From a sci-fi point of view the futuristic tech was also really bland, clunky and left me wondering why.<br/><br/>Politically The theme of hating everyone thats not descendant from Africa was simmering away the whole time. Found that pretty off-putting. Its not 1970 anymore. Re-visiting the politics of the Black Panther political party was pretty crass.<br/><br/>Overall it left me with the impression that the marvel no longer wants to produce the content that made them famous but still want to cash in with out putting the effort in. <br/><br/>Don't pay to see this.

","The most anticipated MARVEL film since 'The Avengers' (2012), does the hype surrounding 'Black Panther' pay off in terms of it being an exceptional film, or does it falter under the weight of expectations?<br/><br/>1. There will be major spoilers scattered throughout my review so this is your last chance to stop reading if you have yet to see the film. The movie picks up a week after the events of 'Captain America: Civil War' as Prince T'Challa returns to his homeland of Wakanda and ascends to the throne as King. The plot on the surface is fine and delivers as expected, but the events that follow isn't anything new. Not saying that's a bad thing, but there was nothing that happened I wasn't surprised about. The more interesting subplot revolves around a past event in which King T'Chaka (John Kani) murders his younger brother N'Jabu (Sterling K. Brown) for trading Wakandan arms to various countries. It turns out N'Jabu had a son (Erik Killmonger) that grew up to seek revenge against the country that abandoned he and his father.<br/><br/>2. As much class and style he possessed for his brief stint in 'Civil War', Chadwick Boseman is not interesting at all as T'Challa/Black Panther. Not saying he's a bad actor, but he plays the character with such drawl and lack of charisma. He does not ""own the role"" as they say, so it's hard for me to buy into it. Michael B. Jordan was by far the most interesting and sympathetic character by far. He brings much needed life into an already dull film. Jordan steals the show as Killmonger but unfortunately he has very little screen-time. After the sequence at the museum in the beginning, Jordan does not show up in the film until 40-45mins later. Killmonger is such a compelling character that by the time he finally pops up again, they rush through his story to where he feels under developed. I would wholeheartedly agree that he could have been the best villain of the MCU to date had the script-writers only incorporated him more into the story. <br/><br/>3. Andy Serkis was an interesting villain as Ulysses Klaue when he first appeared in 'Age of Ultron', but he's murdered by Killmonger halfway through so there obviously won't be any more development for him to say the least. Despite that, Serkis does make his presence known during the casino and chase sequence in South Korea. As far as action. there were only two sequences that I did enjoy, one being Black Panther chasing Klaue through the streets of Korea and Killmonger kicking the crap out of T'Challa to claim the throne as the new King. There honestly wasn't any other set-pieces I enjoyed or found mildly exciting. The final brawl between T'Challa and Killmonger on the subway track was awful. The CGI was weak and the overall fight was boring without any sheer tension or stakes.<br/><br/>4. Apart from Angela Basset and Forest Whitaker, the rest of the supporting cast is either annoying or flat, and the same goes for the humor in the film. If it was up to me, the script would have gotten an overhaul or placed in the hands of actual writers to modify or (better yet) rewrite the whole damn thing. Despite the camera occasionally doing unnecessary close-ups on the fights, the cinematography on the African plains were amazing. The design on Wakanda and the sets blew me away, however, we don't spend a lot of time on the environments to say I felt captivated by it. Maybe 'Infinity War' might do justice for this character once more, but as for now, the Black Panther himself is a weak and undeserving (so-called) hero. Imagine Thor lost his home of Asgard, lost most of his people and even lost an eye all in his last movie, and I truly believe he'd make a better King than T'Challa and actually have the balls to rule Wakanda.<br/><br/>'Black Panther' will undoubtedly sky-rocket at the box-office from all the undeserving false hype. Sure, kids will love it but there's no reason critics to honestly give such a mediocre film glowing reviews. Seeing it for what it, this movie is no better and probably lesser than some of the MCU film before it."

The director/writer pulled out the Marvel hero playbook/check list and stock piled all the clichéd traits/story plots for a ""compelling"" story but as any ""good"" cook knows, having the right ingredients doesn't guarantee a great meal. 
There are many fine actors in this piece, including Chadwick as the hero-guy. BUT, being a good actor doesn't mean you have the ability to carry a film as a lead. Hollywood of old used to call it the ""it"" factor, a better word would be charisma. Jordan as the heavy does have the ""it"" factor, which is not good for the film to have the villain with more than the hero.
This film was simply BORING. Half way through I felt relief because I thought we were nearing the end, but it was when the hero was seemingly defeated so I was painfully reminded we were only in the last half of the 2nd act. ARG! 
I was not engaged with the characters, except the villains. Bad for the audience and the film. Lots of moments for emotional peaks in the story that some how fall short... thus unsatisfying. The ""humour"" falls flat. I am sure an actor with the proven chops of a Robert Downey could have made them work but in the hands of the director the actors did not seem to reach their full potential. Forest Whitaker gave a very over the top performance, a sin for any actor, getting caught at acting. 
I could go on and on with trivial bits of annoyance like lines spoken as there being no better sunsets as seen in the hero's isolationist nation... I guess a sunset off the Fiji coast pales by comparison???"

Then Tchalla´s mother, sister and girlfriend recover him using the powerful plant destined to Wakanda kings. And T'Challa returns to Wakanda in a coup d'état, destroying the aircrafts sent by Killmonger to the spies. W'Kabi and his army support Killmonger and in the end, it seems that everything is all right in Wakanda that seems to have a great division between the social classes.

"eangellmn","1","11","18","17 March 2018"," Long, drawn out, and painful!!
","I have never not liked a superhero movie that came from Marvel or DC Comics, until Black Panther! IMBD gave it a 7.8/10, Rotten Tomatoes a 97%, and Metacritic an 88%! Their showing must've had all the fabulous scenes and storyline that was obviously edited out. I appreciate and enjoy the 3 act structure of the set-up, confrontation, and resolution that the screenwriters and directors use to seamlessly keep these movies action packed, exciting, humorous, emotionally gripping, and thought provoking. None of this was done effectively with Black Panther. I hate to say this but it seemed as if the director, Ryan Coogler was trying to make this movie relative to the struggles of black communities living together in inner-cities. I could be totally in left field with that thought but it just seemed too coincidental. Albeit fine, and if that was his objective, superhero films that are based on the action, adventure, and sci-fi genre don't flow seamlessly, or well, with a film that seems steeped in the drama genre. It was a disappointingly abysmal let down. How this movie got rave reviews by movie critics across the board is mind boggling but in this day and age when you can lose your job, followers, advertising deals by being forthright, unflattering, and God forbid curt and negatively critiquing a film that is made up of 98% African American Actors, Director, and Writers you will unequivocally get torn apart by the news media, social media, and probably ANTIFA! Especially, when you're the only movie critic who mistakenly did his job. I can just imagine them all sitting at their desks after watching Black Panther thinking, ""That movie was utterly horrible, but I can't write that now can I? I'll be made to look like a movie critic version of President Trump, except without the power, billions in net worth, and powerful allies, they'll destroy me! Just lie for God's sake, forget my integrity, moral fortitude, and pride! I'll die if I have to do manual labor!!"

"shawneofthedead","10","73","158","10 March 2018"," This may be Marvel's 18th film, but it feels like the studio is just getting started. Brave and brilliant, this superhero movie is like nothing you've ever seen before.
","Superhero movies never get a fair shake. There's always been an invisible - but undeniable - whiff of critical disdain attached to films revolving around people with superhuman abilities. More often than not, these films are viewed (and assessed) as popcorn entertainment: good fun, but not objectively good. Even the best examples of the genre are rarely, if ever, taken seriously by critics or award shows. But all that is set to change with Black Panther - a bold, brilliant blockbuster teeming with ideas, characters and messages that will make your soul take flight. For once, it's no exaggeration to say that you've never seen or experienced anything like this before.<br/><br/>The film gets off to a somewhat sedate start, as we're re-introduced to T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the freshly crowned King of Wakanda who is also infused with the ancestral powers of his nation's panther god. Writer-director Ryan Coogler takes his time in introducing us to all the key players in the film's first act, from the most important members of T'Challa's royal court to the rites, rituals and rigidity of Wakanda itself.<br/><br/>It's never boring, but Black Panther does linger in a minor key for a while. You might find yourself wondering just where the film is going, as T'Challa deals with a challenge to his authority from within Wakanda's five tribes. It can be hard to imagine, too, just what the film wants to say when T'Challa - who could easily delegate the responsibility - takes it upon himself to personally hunt down dastardly arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) in order to retrieve a stolen artifact made of Wakanda's most precious natural resource, vibranium.<br/><br/>But put your trust in Coogler - he's certainly earned it with his masterful blending of tension, character and story in his previous two films, Fruitvale Station and Creed. As Black Panther unfolds, everything starts to make a whole lot of sense, in dramatic, emotional and narrative terms. Suddenly, we're not just witnessing the growing pains of a new king. As it turns out, Black Panther is, for its titular character, an existential odyssey: as he fights for his nation's survival, T'Challa must also grapple with the choices (and sins) of his ancestors, deciding whether to embrace or reject them.<br/><br/>Most significantly, Black Panther uses its blockbuster platform to examine complex issues such as racism and colonialism in thoughtful, intimate ways. The fiction of Wakanda - a hyper-evolved African nation that has kept its technological advances a secret from the rest of the world for centuries - allows Coogler to hold up a mirror to the facts of the world in which we live. In quite unprecedented fashion, we are presented with a host of proud, brave, indomitable African warriors who have lived their lives free of the horrors of slavery and institutionalised racism. Just as Wonder Woman gave little girls the world over a hero in their own image, Black Panther will do the same for generations of black children who have never before seen themselves represented on screen.<br/><br/>If that sounds impossibly weighty and grim, don't worry. Coogler's script, co-written with Joe Robert Cole, is far from preachy. There may be a hint or two of hand-wringing melodrama to T'Challa's central dilemma - should Wakanda venture out into the world and lead by example? - but it's cleverly off-set by the depths of darkness and despair written into T'Challa's nemesis: Erik 'Killmonger' Stevens (Michael B. Jordan). Shaped by the very different circumstances of their lives, one man turns towards the light, and the other away from it - and yet, neither man falls simply into the black-and-white categories of 'hero' or 'villain'. Somehow, Coogler shades centuries of history and hope into the conflict at the heart of their troubled relationship.<br/><br/>Black Panther is no slouch, either, when it comes to turning up the heat in terms of action and spectacle. There's a jaw-dropping car chase through the neon-washed streets of Busan that's easily one of the most exhilarating scenes you'll see all year. Fight scenes are pulled off with remarkable flair, particularly when it comes to the swift military precision of the Dora Milaje - an incredibly cool, all-female special forces unit devoted to the protection of Wakanda's monarch. Wakanda itself is an eye-popping fantasy scape: a heady blend of futuristic elements and African traditons, colours and music.<br/><br/>Leading the film's top-notch ensemble, Boseman is the film's quiet backbone: an invaluable presence and the reason everything holds together at all. He shares an electric chemistry with Jordan, who blends swagger, menace and pathos in creating the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most complex, nuanced and sympathetic antagonist to date. <br/><br/>Fantastic as the two leading men, however, they're not the breakout stars of the film. That honour belongs to a trio of female characters - each one given depth, layers and a fierce, real on-screen presence that's still rare enough that they shouldn't be taken for granted. Lupita Nyong'o injects strength and steel into her portrayal of Nakia - a former and future love interest for T'Challa who manages to be interesting in her own right. The Walking Dead's Danai Gurira is a force to be reckoned with as Okoye, the righteous leader of the Dora Milaje; while Letitia Wright's Shuri - T'Challla's younger sister who also happens to be Wakanda's premier scientist - waltzes away with every scene in which she appears.<br/><br/>It may come as a surprise to some that Marvel's latest superhero blockbuster tackles issues of race, representation and discrimination in so bold and unflinching a manner. And yet, fans of the comic books that have inspired Marvel's entire slate of films would say: it's about time. In the way it embraces its story and heritage, in the way its heroes are presented, and in the way its message will inspire and empower generations to come, Black Panther matters. And it cannot - and will not - be ignored."

I always watch movies after checking rating and reviews at IMDB hence, I felt I should convey my honest opinion and save others some time and money.
I have never read any of the critics review and have had always gone with user reviews. I really don't know why anyone would rate this movie more than 3-4 stars. Is this the world we live in that just because it is a black majority movie we feel obligated for something and rate this movie high to gratify some particular community. This is by far the worst ever movie I watched of a big budget production house.<br/><br/>Acting: All actors were expressionless and I think they were concentrating more on African accent (which is by the way was more hilarious than real). <br/><br/>CGI: I really didn't like the CGI any better or at-least something to be talked about.<br/><br/>Story: I can understand that it was taken from comics however, plot could have been better.<br/><br/>In general those comic and funny scenes were really bad and I didn't even smile.

"SteveMierzejewski","5","102","229","18 February 2018"," Black Panther Lacks a Bite
","Let me get right to the point. Among the Marvel movies, Black Panther is one of the least successful productions. It's not so much that it lacks any of the major elements of other Marvel films. It has a superhero who kind of has special powers, it has special effects, and it has somewhat innovative fight scenes. No, the problem is in the acting and I'll put the blame for this on the supporting female characters. Their acting is of B-movie quality. It is wooden and stilted causing a lack of any believable emotional connection to other characters in the film. In an effort to make the female characters into powerful male-like warriors, they have sacrificed their humanity,<br/><br/>Most of the male acting is only slightly better. Chadwick Boseman is okay. Michael B. Jordan is a pretty good villain, and Daniel Kaluuya is believable and sincere. But when Sterling K. Brown appears in a cameo, we realize what real good acting consists of and we are suddenly forced to realize what the film is missing. <br/><br/>The plot is predictable, like most Marvel films. It seems to lack some underlying ideal, although it makes an attempt to do this in the conversation we see with Mr. Panther and his father, played very well by John Kani. In the conversation, his father advises him to surround himself with good people, which may serve as an indirect criticism of the corruption that so often appears in African governments. We also have the issue raised by Erik Killmonger (Jordan) who asserts that Wakanda should give its precious super- mineral, vibranium (give me a break), to oppressed black people so that they can fight their oppressors. <br/><br/>Much is made in the pre-release hype about the technologically-advanced, mythical African nation, Wakanda. To me, it looked like Oz's Emerald City without the emerald. There is also a lot of talk on how this film unites black people around the world. Maybe it does. It just seems to me there are so many other films that could do a better job at this and keep us entertained at the same time. In short, there is not much in this film that will keep the average viewer involved. There are some mildly interesting fight scenes and the obligatory car chase has some novel elements, but I would not recommend the film as a whole. Nonetheless, the momentum the film has received from the pre-release media storm will no doubt end up with it making some good box office returns: A triumph of marketing over quality."
"thebricks","3","102","229","17 February 2018"," One of the worst movies I've ever seen, too many plot holes
","Oh yes, this review has spoilers. <br/><br/>1. Lupita Nyongo and Winston Duke do an amazing job in the movie; Chadwick Boseman is way too boring and terrible of an actor to be a leader. Michael B. Jordan completely fails as an actor here. He needs a Razzie for this performance. The rest of the cast are simply contrived or phoning it in for an easy paycheck. Andy Serkis did seem to enjoy his role. It felt like a waste when he was killed off.
2. Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger is the worst villain ever in the Marvel universe. Jordan approaches the character, who is supposed to be a genius, like an NFL defensive end that is on steroids, which makes it very hard to take him seriously. He was smart enough to graduate from the Naval College at 19 and go to MIT for grad school but opts to become a SEAL who kills hundreds of people? Right. Worse yet, Killmonger also appears the be the only character in the history of Wakanda that has any sort of common sense. Aren't you not supposed to sympathize with the bad guy?
3. The whole premise of the country of Wakanda is an insult to Africans and black people in general. Instead of basing Wakanda on your average African country, it is portrayed as being like a futuristic Shanghai with tech that is decades, if not centuries advanced. How in the world has no one left Wakanda and told the world about what is there? How has it been kept a secret? Why haven't they conquered the world? Killmonger is the only leader of Wakanda that has figured out what the country is capable of! Once again, that takes you completely out of the movie. How can a society be so advanced but yet not understand how powerful it is?
4. Wakanda is supposed to be the most advanced nation of Earth but everyone still dresses and acts like primitive tribal people and even determine their leadership through individual combat. Despite being advanced, T'Challa's bodyguards use spears and call guns primitive. Seriously?
5. M'baku, the leader of the Jabari tribe, wants to be the Black Panther very badly and hates every other tribe, but when presented with the chance to ingest the flower that will give him the Black Panther's strength and kill off T'Challa, opts to help him recover instead and take back his throne. Predictably of course, he claims to not want to help T'Challa at first, only to show up during the battle. Surprise! Not really.
6. On the topic of predictability, as soon as you see Daniel Kaluuya's character, you know he's going to be the friend that stabs T'Challa in the back.
7. They tried too hard to push Shuri as a lovable Q like character, but she was never convincing at all. If anything, she was beyond annoying.
8. Black Panther's father, as Black Panther, commits an unsolved black on black murder in a project in Oakland in 1992. I am not making this up.
9. T'Challa comes to Oakland in the present day, shows some kids his futuristic jet, who then gawk and start discussing how they will steal it, strip it down and sell the parts. Once again, not making this up. Wasn't this supposed to be a positive film for black people that didn't reinforce negative stereotypes of them?<br/><br/>10, 20 years ago, movies like this would have been nominated for a Razzie. Now, they are getting near perfect scores on Rotten Tomatoes and under consideration for Oscars. I'm just not buying it. This was one of the worst movies I'd ever seen. I could go into detail but I just can't remember everything. You've been warned."

The action was bathe in bad CGI reminiscent of The Matrix Reloaded. A great story was ruined with an unnecessary love story. I don't know why critics are turning their back on Blade and Spawn. these movies were the first black Superhero films. Spawn was also flawed, but even with it's shortcomings, it's a far better movie than this. Blade on the other-hand was extremely well done and Black Panther doesn't come close to capturing the action, energy or excitement of Blade. <br/><br/>I really hated this film and Coogler had been on a streak. Who knows, Black Panther didn't impress me in Civil War either. He's strong in the comic books, but I honestly don't care for Chadwick Boseman. 42, Get on Up, Draft Day, all really bad films. This guy appear to be the black Shia Lebeouf. I guess Hollywood is planning to shove him down our throat like they are doing with Josh Gad. We are limited with strong black talent in Hollywood, that doesn't mean we should be using just anyone for pivotal role. <br/><br/>My 5 stars for this film are generous."
"bankofmarquis","8","31","62","19 February 2018"," Inwardly focused SuperHero film mostly works
","THE BLACK PANTHER is the first entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that relies - predominantly - on characters (and actors) of color to carry it. Of the main characters, only 2 are Caucasian, the rest of the cast (including almost all of the supporting cast and the extras) - AND the Director are people of color. This has, rightfully so, created a ""buzz"" about the significance of this. It is a watershed moment for SuperHero films (much like last year's WONDER WOMAN was a watershed for a female led SuperHero film). But the question remains - is it a good film?<br/><br/>The answer: Good Enough.<br/><br/>Diving deeper into the character/hero T'Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) who was first introduced in CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. In this film, we learn more about the backstory of this man/character as well as the world in which he lives and the burdens he bears. It also, interestingly enough, pretty much ignores the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for much of it's 2 hour 14 minute timeline. It mostly concerns itself with interior issues in the hidden kingdom of Wakanda and I think this tactic is a welcome relief from the giant, CGI-laden, characters-heavy Marvel films of recent memory.<br/><br/>Director/Writer Ryan Coogler (CREED/FRUITVALE STATION) decides to focus the attention of this film inward, rather than outward and we are rewarded with a rich, Shakespearean family drama that works because of it's simplicity.<br/><br/>Much of the effectiveness is due to the charismatic cast that has been drawn to this picture because of the significance of it as well as the richness of the characters they inhabit. Bozeman is regal and strong in the title role - no hint of the suffering, ""I don't want this"" SuperHero angst so often seen in these types of film. Academy Award winner Lupito Nyong'o joins in just as strong and independently as Nakia a ""Spy"" and erstwhile romantic foil for T'Challa - though Coogler is wise to avoid the ""will they/won't they"" cliche as well as eliminates, entirely, the ""damsel in distress"" subplot that would have been so tempting.<br/><br/>Helping these two out are a veritable ""who's who"" of actors of color - Angela Bassett, Forrest Whitaker, current Best Actor nominee Daniel Kaluuya and Sterling K. Brown - all turn out for fun (albeit brief) turns where each one of them gets a chance to show what they can do. Special notice should be made to Danai Gurira (TV's kick-ass Michonne in THE WALKING DEAD) as Okoye - T'Challa's chief general and bodyguard who must choose duty over honor (or does she) and, especially, Letitia Wright as T'Challa's younger, wise-cracking sister - who also happens to be the ""Q"" of this film. She jumped off the screen and shone brightly (but not so bright as to wash things out) in every scene she was in.<br/><br/>And...of course...there is Coogler favorite Michael B. Jordan (he's been in all of Coogler's major motion picture) as the villain of the piece - Erik Killmonger (the name says it all). Jordan does a nice job of bringing 3 dimensions to a character that was written a little too 2 dimension-ally, if you ask me. This character could have just been an ""angry young man"" cliche, but with Jordan, he becomes something much, much more.<br/><br/>This being a Marvel SuperHero film, the Special Effects are terrific, showing a highly secretive, highly technolized Wakanda that is hidden beneath the surface.<br/><br/>Is it a perfect film? Well...no. This is, in essence, a ""family drama"" with some hi-tech action scenes and the obligatory ""two armies fighting"" finale, and while the acting is good enough to hold interest throughout, I would have liked to have seen a little more action thrown in.<br/><br/>But...ignoring the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was a good move - as was casting such strong, believable and likeable film actors.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A-<br/><br/>8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

","I was incredibly hyped for this movie and thought the movie was mostly great until they subtle racial motivations became thrown in your face by the killmonger character.<br/><br/>The saving grace of this movie was the excellent acting by everyone involved.
They actually made strong female characters without having to make the male characters pathetic by comparison. the dormalaj (female guard) stole the show in my opinion and made wonder woman look second rate, they did so while not making the male counterparts look pathetic....take a note star wars.<br/><br/>however the movie was nearly ruined by the racial agenda. While there was racism toward white people in pushing that white people of today are somehow evil and accounted for the deeds of their ancestors, it was far more racist toward black people.<br/><br/>They made the black characters killmonger, his father, black panthers love interest and a few others very very racist toward black people. They kept referring to all black people as one people and brothers and sisters. That they were enslaved and oppressed. All black people are not the same, every black person is their one person and has their own beliefs and experiences. To lump all the black people of the world together simply because they have the same skin color is quite racist. Would you lump south koreans in with people of thailand? no because even though they share similarities, they are in fact very different people. Would you lump white Russians in with White americans or Austrailians? No because they are entirely different people. Skin color is the most common character distinction in people but it is also the most insignificant.<br/><br/>Not to mention wakanda was shown to exist in the heart of africa, slaves were never or extremely rarely taken from inner countries they were mostly taken from coastal countries. further to that point, by enlarge slaves were sold to sailors by african tribes. It was common practice for warring tribes to take slaves as spoils of war and they would sell them to ships that would come by on the trade routes. Slaves were taken by force at times by colonizers but this was not needed most of the time as tribes warred and took slaves to use as commodities not only with white sailors but also with other african tribes. <br/><br/>At least for the most part the character of black panther stays away from this and tries to distinguish that black people all over the world are not his people, his people are those of wakanda.<br/><br/>it was just terrible writing. People go to see fantasy movies to get away from the real world and it is just terrible to see identity politics in a fantasy movie."

"rphand1116","9","39","81","19 February 2018"," Best Marvel Origin FIlm, Maybe the Best Marvel Film Yet...
","The fact that the film's rating continues to climb despite the organized efforts to bring down it's rating is a testament to how good this movie really is. <br/><br/>I went in fairly skeptical - I'm not into comic books and am not familiar with the Black Panther series at all. I also haven't seen Creed or Fruitvale Station so I'm not familiar with the director's work. <br/><br/>As we were stepping out of the theater I was almost speechless, the best I could say at the time was ""there are a LOT of things I loved about that.""<br/><br/>The first thing that came to mind at the time, was the wonderful portrayal of Shuri by Letitia Wright and she's a good place to start...<br/><br/>As the plot is being constructed, shortly into the film, we are introduced to King T'Challa's younger sister, the brilliant Shuri in a role that defies all the typical 'nerd girl' cliches (she's self assured in all ways, enthusiastic to the point of exuberance,and completely ready to take the fight on herself) - she takes her brother on a tour of her lab showing him all the new tools and inventions she's come up with to help on their mission - the scene is an unabashedly loving take on the classic ""Q and Bond"" sequences from James Bond. 
The Bond feel then carries over into the next scene in a South Korean casino, which culminates in the best choreographed fight scene to date in any Marvel film. 
This then carries into a car chase sequence that continues to pay reference to Bond - in just the first viewing I caught references to both Brosnan and Moore era films in the car chase alone. <br/><br/>Outside of that aspect of the filmmaking, every other aspect of this movie is also very nearly perfect;
The world of Wakanda is so well built and the supporting characters are so much fun and so well done I could see this being the foundation of a long and varied franchise. I can think of three spin-offs I'd love to see. 
The overall storyline is the most original to date in the Marvel Universe - especially for a 'tentpole' film.
The villain, Michal B Jordan, is one of the most menacing and yet fully realized villains for Marvel - it's been said that the villain is the hero in his own story and this couldn't be more true than in this film. 
The dialog is fast, brilliant, and daring.<br/><br/>The final words spoken by Michael B Jordan, towards the end of the film, are the heaviest, darkest and most meaningful words spoken in any of these Marvel films. The line is so raw and honest and devastating I forgot I was watching a Disney-produced comic book film. <br/><br/>This is an exceptional film - ignore all the phony reviews here, give up preconceptions or misplaced feelings of being 'left out' of a 'black movie'. The pitiable and ineffectual racists who feel the need to blast this movie without seeing it are perhaps the ones who need to see it the most."

"rick-73592","1","4","5","8 March 2019"," Green Book is way better
","While I was watching the movie, I felt somewhat disappointed and uncomfortable. I honestly believe that Black Panther lack respect to the real African people and their culture. And Africa itself is nothing more than a symbol to fulfill the western audiences' curiosity. The settings in the movie are contradictory, and they do not make sense. I cannot imagine with Wakanda as a country with such advanced technology; people still need to win the throne through a savage fistfight. And technically, T'Challa did lose his throne in the combat, and then he revived by eating secret herbs. I think he violates the rules of his own country. But in the movie, he was still depicted as the right one to rule just because he's the decent man and his brother was depicted as a nasty guy.
Besides, there are other logical errors in the film. According to the settings in the movie, T'Challa's sister should be the real ruler of the kingdom since technology is the most potent productive tool there. When his sister controls all the technology, she could easily manipulate the whole Wakanda. The movie is also full of stereotyped images of African people including strange clothes, combat strategies, weird rituals. I'm not saying they are all fake African elements. I'm assuming that these elements are disjointed with modern society and are insipid. Overall, I think if Black Panther should be considered as the victory of the Black people, it's only the victory of the Hollywood Black people. However, the visual effects in the film are pretty cool, but they are still repetitive products of the film industry."

","Oh dear. I managed to avoid spoilers before going to see this but, quite frankly, it wouldn't have mattered either way. This film has the most predictable script I've seen in a long time, to the point where me and my other half were able to tell each other what was going to happen next with a 100% level of accuracy for the entire film. Most MCU films I've seen (there are a few exceptions) have scripts that at least have some parts that surprise me. Not one bit of this travesty did.<br/><br/>Realistically, any MCU film that isn't prefixed with ""Avengers"" is basically a filler film to move the narrative along. We all know this. Yet recent efforts like Thor: Ragnarok and both Guardians movies have been enjoyable and fun despite this. Black Panther felt like the writers scribbled this down while saying ""Well, the audience needs to know this so it has to go in the sequence. It doesn't matter if they don't enjoy it"". Every minute of it felt like a setup for Infinity War. And that makes me sad. Every move through the narrative felt laboured and clunky to the point where I nearly left the cinema.<br/><br/>My biggest bugbear of all though (and this is where the SPOILERS appear), is how they wasted the best villain they've created in years. Hell, it might be the best villain they've EVER created. Michael B Jordan is sublime in his role as the antagonist and puts in quite probably the finest performance in a MCU film (closely battling Brolin's Thanos). He was cold, calculating, brutal and, most importantly, totally believable. And then they killed him. I was genuinely so angry that I gave an audible FFS in the cinema. <br/><br/>This film is a crime against cinema. It gets an extra point for Jordan's performance which makes it all the more frustrating that they killed him off. I wanted to like it so much but it's impossible."

","Allow me to preface my review by saying I have loved all the previous Marvel Universe movies. However, I found Black Panther a yawnfest. It seemed to lack the feel of the other movies in the franchise and I was really struggling to watch all of it until the end. It was such a relief when those credits rolled.<br/><br/>ActuallyI thought the acting was good but the plot was lacking. It seemed to be going nowhere very slowly most of the time. I couldn't relate to the characters either which meant I didn't like any of them. If they make a sequel, I hope it's at least interesting.<br/><br/>Overall a disappinting effort from Marvel but I still look forward to the next installment."

The story tried to portray morals, but these were bad morals. The movie copied lots of famous titles like Casino Royale - there is a scene which is almost an identical copy, Avatar and more.<br/><br/>Visual affects were decent at times.<br/><br/>With regards to the story it tries to portray the advanced society where the main characters live as a modal society for the world to follow.

"nodlimax","3","19","36","4 March 2018"," This movie promotes disgusting ideas
","Let me get the positives out of the way first. Visually the movie is good and the sound effects are also good.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the rest.<br/><br/>The story is a complete mess and FULL of political ""ideas"" that are at minimum a little bit questionable. The actress that plays Michonne on TWD plays a character here that stays loyal to the nation of Wakanda and the throne. It doesn't matter who sits on it and what kind of questionable decisions that person makes. I think most dictators in human history would be proud of this kind of loyalty. Overall she just follows orders and never in history has that ever gone wrong. The only reason why she turns on Killmonger is that T'Chala (Black Panther) was still alive and the so called ""challenge"" wasn't over.<br/><br/>How one is supposed to even remotely connect to that character is beyond me. If BP really would have been dead she would have been one of the ""bad guys"", because she is loyal to the current king.<br/><br/>The sharing of technology was only ever discussed in terms of giving it black people to fight their ""oppressors"" while calling all the white people colonizers and oppressors, This movie promotes a race war and that makes me sick.<br/><br/>In addition the movie premise doesn't make any sense to begin with. There was the asteroid that hit Africa over a million years ago and people in the area started using the vibranium and advanced on a technological level much faster than other civilizations. Yet they didn't try to unite the people of Africa and share their technology amongst all black people? Remember please that the earliest records of colonization relates to Egypt and Ancient Greece (around 500BC) and they pretty much were limited to the most northern Parts of Africa. The more aggressive colonization happened many centuries later once communication and weapons were improved. So overall based on the story the Wakandans had a lot of time to take over Africa and build an extremely superior culture compared to the rest of the world. Yet they let their ""brothers and sisters"" be enslaved and mistreated. What does that make them?<br/><br/>I know this is just a movie. But people treat it as extremely important, because it's about ""black power"" ehm I mean empowerment. I have seen movies and TV shows back in the 90s that were more progressive than this.<br/><br/>I originally wanted to stay away from the movie because it was so politically charged. But curiosity got the better of me and I watched it and I wish I hadn't seen it."

That is false in my opinion - Thor Ragnorok and Guardians 2 were by far the best so far - full of action, humor, and good stories. Black Panther movie does not even do much for the cinematic universe as it all takes place in Wakanda. The end credit scenes do tie it in but that's it really. <br/><br/>PROS :

I don't understand some things being mentioned because this movie references the previous movies so much. The opening is good but the story drags that it becomes boring. The fight scenes are good but don't expect so much action from this film. The film is so predictable that I was yawning at some moments.

"Deoglood","4","59","131","16 February 2018"," Such a frustrating disappointment
","I was looking forward to Black Panther last year when it was announced, but as the release came closer, it became clear that the marketing team was working overtime. In fact, it became suspiciously clear that the movie may be compensating for something.<br/><br/>And also in fact, I admit being turned off because every web page I visited, every trailer I wanted to see, everywhere I turned, Black Panther's ads were in my face worse than a mobile service provider or insurance ad. At least those didn't take over what I am trying to read.<br/><br/>So, seriously, I knew there was going to be political and social messages, I can't think of any Marvel or DC superhero movie that doesn't have one. I accept that the atrocities that have happened and happen today in Africa can be powerfully addressed in a mainstream movie, indeed I was looking forward to it.<br/><br/>What I think is a shame is how that chance was buried beneath magical technology. I know, I know. The comic book version made it work. On big screen, the costume-change was more absurd than when Wonder Woman spun around in a blast of light. And I know so many of the others in the Marvel universe have blingie wardrobe swapping also, so why should this movie's bother me?<br/><br/>Because it distracts from the already stressed-out plot. I wouldn't begrudge an ethnic or gender group the privilege to share the same insta-powers and unbelievable technology or give airtime to diversity (I'm still waiting for Colossus to come out!) but in this case, Marvel did the genre a disservice. Why oh why wasn't I consulted on these nuances?<br/><br/>Just as Marvel Studio spent too much money on marketing, they spent too much money on focus groups. They are trying to appeal to a specific audience and yet maintain balance and it doesn't work. What could have been a beautiful and strong story ends up being overhyped, muddied, and ultimately ungraceful in the face of a diverse culture's own depth of flavor and strength.<br/><br/>I agree with Roger Moore's Metacritic score of 63, and I still look forward to future additions to the Black Panther series, with hopefully more elegant approaches and culturally worthy scripting.<br/><br/>Oh, and while the 'white boy' comment maybe culturally authentic, it was just as unwelcome as the 'n'-word.<br/><br/>Edit: And btw while Blade was the first black Marvel hero on screen, nobody bothers to mention Storm being the first AFRICAN hero on screen, but gosh all the street-racer thug wannabes can't relate to her much, not enough 'tude."

","The first time a saw the trailer for this movie last year a had a feeling that it will be boring. Nothing about it was exciting, but I said I have to give it a chance.<br/><br/>I probably need to listen to my gut more often because this movie was a waste of time and money. I do not get why all the critics praise this movie. It just didn't click with me, like I was looking at something not important, with no real story, more like a reenacted documentary from a science and history channel.<br/><br/>The CGI was outdated (those rhinos were the worse - if you saw the movie, you understand). The city looked so fake, even Asgard from the first Thor looked more real. The action was boring and it just did not make sense some time.<br/><br/>Besides the good cast this movie is just boring and not relevant enough like the other MCU movies. I really do not get the hype and the critical acclaim. It feel fabricated and not organic.<br/><br/>There was too much talking about nothing, about what is good and was is not for Wakanda to go public with that unrealistic technology jump they have from vibranium. If you have an advanced civilization build in that bubble, why do you still need to choose your next king totally undemocratic, but the old fashion way - just fight for the tittle. If you leave this plot hole out you really have no movie, because the villain will just not form. I mean they try to bring in a villain half way into the movie, and you don't know him, you do not care enough for his motives, just boring.<br/><br/>I get what Marvel wanted to do with this movie (as I said - fabricated for the really annoying Hollywood so this and so that movements from the past years) - but just that make no good movie. <br/><br/>This was suppose to happen shortly after the events at the UN meeting in Captain America: Civil War. I mean the king just died and everybody is just fine: no funeral, no tears, no heart-brake, just a short mention in the beginning before that fight for the title. <br/><br/>I never felt so un-invested in a MCU movie before.<br/><br/>Also that Wakanda Forever feels like the X-factor sign and it scares me because it feels like brainwashing of the people."
"methodman-14473","1","18","34","20 February 2018"," Don't waste your money.
","Maybe the worst film I've ever seen. I'm not going to waste much time unpacking the juvenile plot except to say that much of the dialog dripped with sarcasm and contempt for the ""white race"" who were referred to as ""colonizers"" and ""oppressors"" which had stole Africa's rich historical culture and art while profiting from it. Even the villian, who wanted to use his country's superior technology to destroy evil western civilization, was really just a young misunderstood ""freedom fighter"" trying to set things right. As others have mentioned, I go to the movies for escape from modern American politics, only to find I have paid to be preached to and insulted for 90 minutes. 
 I suppose the second problem and probably the greater problem is the film was boring. The young man why portrayed Black Panther is a good actor and I have admired his work in other films on Netflix so this is nothing against him but there was so many problems with this thing, not even his genius could save it."

It's unfortunate, but I found myself caring more about the outcome of the villain than the Black Panther. I didn't actually care that much when he ""dies"" in his second challenge, because I was left thinking, to an extent, that he deserved it. What kind of country with so amazing technological innovation and wealth isn't run democratically? It seems almost like an oxymoron to have such powerful weapons and such a weak political system at the same time, but ah well. I guess that's Wakandan culture or something. In summary, the main issue to be resolved in the movie was preventable and stupid. But the rest of the film is pretty cool, so go watch it and make your own mind up"

2. It looks sensational. Everything just looked really, really cool. The city, the technology, the natural splendor, the costumes, etc. Very, very cool.
3. It's something different. Basing a movie and a superhero franchise in Africa is refreshingly different.
4. Little sister. The ""Q"" of Black Panther. Tough not to love her.
5. Angela Basset is as lovely as ever. Lead actor was terrific.
6. Pretty good plot twist.<br/><br/>DISLIKE:
1. I fear this whole superhero genre is starting to reach the end of its tether. All of the story elements are just starting to feel a little stale.
2. Although very good, Black Panther is nowhere near as good as X-Men, Avengers, Ragnarok, Spider-Man, and almost any other MCU production.
3. It seemed like it was pretty difficult to break away from the tentacles of The Lion King. It was really tough not to be thinking about it though the movie.
4. The racial elements seemed a little heavy-handed and clumsy.
5. I think I'm getting Forrest Whitaker fatigue.
6. These superhero flicks really need to reevaluate what a climactic fight scene is supposed to be. I was getting bored out of my mind during the last twenty minutes.
7. The opening weekend hype was pretty ridiculous.<br/><br/>Overall though, another trophy on Marvel's overflowing, jam-packed shelf. Go see it, if and when you have the time. Just bear in mind it's nowhere as good as the public was led to believe."

","I don't understand the low ratings and the snide remarks that some of the reviews are making about the actors in the movie, Black Panther. It's a comic book with real actors portraying comic characters! Why are there remarks regarding how unrealistic it is and how illogical some things are, it's a comic book! Nobody gets upset about Iron Man and the highly-advanced weapons and high-technological weapons that he uses, it's the same thing with Black Panther. Could it be because 95% of the actors in the movie are Black? Come on people, get over it! Not everyone in America (or Africa for that matter) is white! I enjoyed the movie and took it for what it is, a comic book!"

","Man o man, i cant say how disappointed i have been after watching this movie. Let me tell you that after Thor Ragnarok, i was way too excited to see the next MARVEL movie... Black panther was one of the new ones that i was looking forward to but i tell you, what disappointment it turned out to be.<br/><br/>Without spoilers, let me tell you, there is absolutely nothing that will make you stun or surprised or praise anything that you have not already watched in the trailer. Actually the trailer of this movie had almost all the cool scenes and thats it.<br/><br/>NO action... just a mess all around. No integrity what so ever.. a 100% predictable movie from the first 5 mins. an over stretch of a first 2 mins of movie. <br/><br/>THIS IS THE ONLY SUPER HERO MOVIE THAT I DID NOT EVEN WAITED TO SEE THE END OF CREDIT SCENES... !!

I am surprised how such junk movies are being hyped till maximum.. I seriously have lost all faith on Critics and ratings... That is now all a business and game..

"dfs-04783","1","11","19","21 February 2018"," The Villain is more a Hero than the Hero
","In Black Panther, what made Killmonger a villain? Remember he grew up in poor Oakland where his father (N'Jobu) was killed by his own brother the King of Wakanda. After seeing the oppressed situation of Black Men in America (racism, mass incarceration and less opportunity), he (N'Jobu) wanted to empower black men by arming them with vibranium as to give them a fighting chance in a world that has been so unjust and so unfair to them. Does that make him a villain?<br/><br/>The wealthy and technologically advanced nation of Wakanda disguised itself as a third world country while a few black wakandans with a vision and objective to help black people emancipating all around the world are the two protagonists in this drama. There were ways in which the director could have made them reconciled. What is wrong with the idea of empowering black people around the globe? Have not Jews or Arabs empowering their owns all throughout history? In this story, Killmonger is my HERO.<br/><br/>So T'Chaka killed his own brother and depicted him as a traitor and treasonous war dog because he wanted to liberate black people from their oppressors. Killmonger believed he could carry on with his father's legacy by returning to Wakanda and ascends to the throne and then by all cost make vibranium available to all Black people around the world therefore conquering the world. Is there one black person who would not want to Black people to rule the world?<br/><br/>The movie comes down to a choice between two cousins T'Challa and Killmonger. In a time where Black Lives Matter has been a force, a time that is marked by overt racism, an African Man destined to be King has to fight his own cousin whose main goal is: Black Liberation. Marvel has to show us that a black person has to kill his own black cousin who has every right to be King, fight agsinst his own PEOPLE in order to prevail. What About all the white supremacists and your plea for Donald Trump to disassociate himself from them, about your contempt for colonialism? A movie that celebrate black empowerment where the only empowered blacks on the movie are the ones of noble association. For all the villains that exist in the world today, the MOST Dangerous Person in the World had to be a BLACK AMERICAN MAN.<br/><br/>So we could not find a way where a rogue nation tried getting access to the vibranium, a terrorist or Kim Jong Un? Even the main white character in the movie a CIA agent whom we know what their role is in destabilizing governments whether for good or bad reasons got to be a hero and helped save Wakanda from the MOST DANGEROUS PERSON ON EARTH, A BLACK MAN WITH RIGHT TO THE THRONE.<br/><br/>So you tell me Eric Killmonger, a black man from Oakland, CA whose father was murdered by his own family and who was left to grow up and lived in poverty, a man with a dream to save BLACK PEOPLE all around the globe is the most dangerous man on Earth!<br/><br/>Gimme a freaking break! (Explicit, excuse my French)<br/><br/>This is racist, you can call me a hater and a Trump lover but if that is not racist, tell me what else is racist. In a age where the Black Man in America is going through difficult challenges, that's the best you have.<br/><br/>I love the representation of Strong Black Women, independent, brave and courageous, they stood up for what's right and I hope our women continue to follow their exemple. However let me reiterate the reason why I am not impressed as an Immigrant and BLACK AMERICAN MAN (Immigrant, remember Killmonger is the son of an immigrant):<br/><br/>Black Panther (T'Challa) is meant to be the hero of Black people because he is a black guy destroying bad guys who are trying to destroy good people. But the bad guy is the lone Black American Man who correctly identifies white supremacy, colonial injustice, lack access to education and technology and lack of opportunity as the main threat to Black people. The bad guy is the guy who wants Wakanda to help black people all over the world. The bad guy is the guy who has no longer patience, he wants to empower black people now.<br/><br/>For these reasons, I am not impressed.<br/><br/>KILLMONGER IS MY HERO and I believe the best words in the movie are these: ""Bury me in the ocean, with my ancestors that jumped from the ships, because they knew death was better than bondage."""

Even people with no acting skills could do better, just so poorly researched. Busan felt like a copy paste CGI. I'm not sure what's the Panther's purpose? I felt no connection to any characters whatsoever. Critics should be ashamed of themselves calling this a masterpiece. Probably they felt pressured to dish out a nice review, if not, the backlash from black communities would be huge and they would be labeled racists? It's just a bad movie, maybe worst by Marvel.

Maybe each showing for Black Panther could be pre-empted by a showing of I am Not Your Negro, although that documentary is miserably lacking in the explosions and stabbings which fill Black Panther.<br/><br/>There are a lot of fights in Black Panther, a lot of them where light is lacking, making the whirlwind attacks difficult to parse, confusing to discern, and baffling to ingest. There are calls to action coupled with critiques of isolationism, a couple of astral projections, and several Black Panthers. With the Q-like Shuri helping improve tech gadgetry, a better title might have been Vibraniumfinger.<br/><br/>Black Panther lacks the fun of other Marvel fare like Deadpool or Spider-Man: Homecoming, maybe intentionally so, with awkward jokes peppered in a just the wrong moments, trying to bring light-heartedness into dire situations and uncomfortable realities. If the world outside is one of unjustly oppressed people, the world inside is only as just as the strongest, most enlightened, and physically fittest autocrat.<br/><br/>We learn that bad power leads to oppression, and good power leads to good oppression, but only if used properly and respectfully.

Honestly, I hated the last 20 minutes so much I felt like I was watching a Transformers spin-off. Not just the war-rhinos, which were utterly, shockingly bad, but the entirety of all three of the final sequences were poor CGI, poorly shot, poorly choreographed and added absolutely nothing. <br/><br/>Also this is the first Marvel movie where I simply didn't care about any of the characters. No-one was relatable. The closest I could get was to Killmonger, who at least had reasons for his overall behaviour and a character arc that goes somewhere.

","Waisted part of my life watching this horrible, pretentious, unrealistic, silly and overrated African narm. There is no harmony in Africa because everyone is different. There's more diversity among Homo sapiens in Africa than any place on earth. Just because you have black skin makes you my brother is an idealistic bunch of hogwash. Anyway, the CGI stunk, the characters were one demential and the production design laughable in its over use of oddball African motifs. Also, this film actually thinks its audience will believe there was a futurist modern African country with a hyper sonic subway and super technology around when the Belgian Congo was a systemic holocaust. Why didn't this goofy nation, light years ahead of the world, stop that genocide? I'll answer my own question: because the writer, producers and director didn't have an iota's worth of knowledge of the history of Africa nor did they bothered to do any research. The antagonist of the film was a conglomeration of hip hop gangsta clichés. The only believable character was the bewildered white dude going through the motions of acting. Hollywood has been the worst perpetuator of stereotyping in the history of this world. Anyone who liked this film and praised it was either phony PC or lacking in taste or both.

"niels2765","4","5","7","14 May 2019"," Fails on so many levels... not even a fun superhero movie... plain bad.
","One of the most controversial opinions I have is my hatred for Black Panther, and how I think it may be the most overrated movie of the year along with Ready Player One. Before you start commenting ''Oh you are racist'' just hear me out.<br/><br/>Obviously there are good bits about Black Panther, not many but, even Ready Player One has good parts to it, so of course Black Panther will as well.<br/><br/>To be fair to Black Panther, the costume design in the movie was fantastic, mostly due to the rathertalented Ruth Carter. Black Panther won the Oscar for costume design, where Ruth Carter became the first black designer to win the award. I would argue that The Favourite and Sandy Powell would have deserved it more, yet I wasn't too bothered with this win of theirs. The costumes used in Black Panther are fantastic and apparently very costly as well. These costumes include futuristic designs and African tribal designs, Ruth Carter does a tremendous job on the costume design.<br/><br/>Black Panther had a very impressive production design, a rare sight for Marvel films, who have a reputation of having a poor production design. Again, Black Panther was nominated for an Oscar in this category, and for once, I would agree that they should've won in this category. The production design is so impressive in Black Panther. Hannah Bleacher, the production designer for Black Panther essentially created a whole society, in Wakanda. She created a sub-Saharan country, and used essential real-life elements and incorporated in this fantasy world. She made an futuristic city in a country that is clearly located in Africa. Hannah Bleacher used the costumes designed by Ruth Carter as inspiration for the production design. Bleacher clearly worked extremely hard in order to create this world, in fact, she traveled around Africa in order to get ideas on what Wakanda should be like, and other settings. Despite my hatred for the movie, I put my hat off to Bleacher as she does a great job with the production design.<br/><br/>Music is ok, nothing much to say, can't judge music. It fits well with the movie, and I thought the music was appropriate.<br/><br/>Now onto to the political commentary. Most of the reviews to this movie were politically motivated, due to the political commentary in the movie. But the political commentary in the movie is basically that Michael B Jordan who plays Killmonger in Black Panther wants to kill all the white people, and Chadwick Boseman who plays T'Challa wants to stop him. This movie attempts to make a commentary about how black people are treated in the United States, but it's so bad. Zootopia has better political commentary in it. All these reviews are so deluded, and think the movie is a great movie because of its message it sends. The movie's target audience is so mainstream, it targets everyone.<br/><br/>The director of this movie, Ryan Coogler, is a fantastic director, and has directed great movies, such as Creed and Fruitvale station, but he has no experience when it comes to making a Marvel movie. He is an extremely talented director, and his talent is put to waste in this movie, he is unable to express his full creativity, and clearly wanted to steer the movie in another direction, but was unable to due to Marvel wanting to sell this movie to a mainstream audience. He has a 200 million budget to work with, yet can't express his true directing talents. He uses the basic marvel structure to a film, making the directing poor and unoriginal. The storyline was basic and lackluster. The action scenes in Black Panther are badly shot, and extremely lazy. Ryan Coogler had no past experience with filming action prior to become the director of Black Panther. Let this experience be a lesson to him, he is much better off not filming big blockbuster movies that's sole purpose is to gain a large financial reception.<br/><br/>The main character who is portrayed by Chadwick Boseman is T'Challa or Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman is solid in his performance as Black Panther, but the character is so uninteresting. He is just boring. He seems to be good at being a king and a warrior, and seems to be unbeatable, making the movie very predictable. He's the son of a king, and a warrior for Wakanda. He is a very uninteresting, yet I think Chadwick Boseman is a good actor, just doesn't have a script to work with.<br/><br/>The villain is Killmonger played by Michael B Jordan. Michael B Jordan isn't a very good villain, despite the villain being one of the best parts of the movie according to the critics. He is a very generic character and doesn't have a good motivation, just wanting to take over Wakanda and use his power for the better. This is a regurgitated motivation, and is used in so many movies. Michael B Jordan is really poor in this movie, despite him being such a great actor. Again he can't work well with the script. He was a forgettable villain, and was a completely overrated character. Compare Killmonger to The Joker from The Dark Knight. The Joker is almost better in every single way. He has a better motivation, Heath Ledger portrays him perfectly, and is so unforgettable. Exactly the opposite of Killmonger. There is also no character development in Killmonger. He has a two minute backstory in the middle of the movie, which doesn't explain much.<br/><br/>Forest Whittaker, who is a fantastic actor, and played one of my favourite roles of all time, in The Last King of Scotland as Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, does a poor job in Black Panther, he plays the exact same character he did in Rogue One.<br/><br/>Just look at this video and you'll know what I mean;<br/><br/>The visual effects in Black Panther is so inconsistent. Sometimes the visual effects are amazing, but sometimes it's awful. As you can see in the video just shown, Black Panther had some horrible CGI.<br/><br/>Not much to comment on the cinematography of the film, it's so basic, and uncreative, but what can I expect from some a bland looking movie. The color palette of the movie is basic, and the CGI, as I said before is inconsistent. Ryan Coogler doesn't know how to direct film scenes<br/><br/>Large parts of this action sequence is badly shot, and again throughout the action sequence you can see the inconsistency in CGI.<br/><br/>The dialogue is one of the worst bits about the whole movie. It's so weak, and bland. The dialogue is so predictable and bland. Every character speaks their mind, it seems like they don't think before they say anything. It is a superhero movie, so I wouldn't expect an amazing script, but dialogue this bad?<br/><br/>The movie is so cringeworthy at some parts, and the humor is so bad. At one point they make a ''what are those joke''and it made me want to kill myself<br/><br/>Overall, Black Panther is a bad movie. It's extremely overrated and didn't deserve those oscars it was nominated for. The movie failed on so many levels. The plot is predictable, unoriginal and doesn't start until halfway through the movie. A movie doesn't need a good plot, as seen with the lobster, which has one of the craziest plots I have ever heard. The plot of the lobster is a man needs to find a wife in 40 days or else he'll become an animal, the plot is stupid, unique but bad, yet it is executed so well.<br/><br/>Black Panther has bad dialogue, basic cinematography, okay music, no humour, inconsistent visual effects, bad acting, poor characters and a bad plot. The movie is a really overrated movie, and has been completely overrated by critics, who think the movie as much deeper than it actually is. If this movie was a superhero with majority of the cast being white, it would be compared to the third reich.<br/><br/>I give this movie a rating.... 4/10"

The film suffers from bad acting (yet it won awards for acting), bad accents (most annoying!!), plot flaws deluxe, conveniences like you've never seen before, and inconsistent visual effects (yet it won awards for visual effects).<br/><br/>I've heard a lot of negative reviews about the the film and went in with an open mind. I wanted to like the film, but hence, there was nothing to enjoy here. None of the actors, or characters, were believable. The plot and dialogue is terrible. The technology and inventions are outrageously silly (almost laughable). I can't get over how BAD the acting was, as if none of the actors truly believed in the film and therefore showed very little enthusiasm. The attempts at humor left very little to be desired. It was just corny and completely out of place. I also did not enjoy their racism remarks like ""Great! Another broken white boy to fix."" I wonder how many times I yawned or rolled my eyes during the first 30 minutes of the film... They also certainly know how to waste time in this film...<br/><br/>Ok, some spoilers. In the beginning, Black Panther drinks a potion to strip him of his strength (as they did numerous times during the film in order to make him more vulnerable - how stupid!). Why did they even bother writing this scene where he is being challenged as king? It was so obvious he would win. Why would Ulysses agree to meet in a casino (of all places!!) to do his deal? (Oh, and Andy Serkis was so bad as Ulysses, I think he should rather stick to monkey business!). Nothing about this scene was believable. During all the fighting and shooting, you see a few people running about, but there's no panic. Even the bloody extras were bad!!<br/><br/>Also, during the entire film Black Panther doesn't act like a king and no-one respects him like one. He is a very timid, pushover of a character. No back bone! Later, when Erik Killmonger challenges Black Panther and they fight, he throws Black Panther off the cliff, and then proudly proclaims he is the new king. He is then immediately crowned King. What!!!??? No-one even bothers confirming the Black Panther - their reigning king - is really dead??? They don't even bother to go look for him, find him, bury him??? Wow, that's loyalty towards your king!! If this was a silly kids cartoon it might have been acceptable but certainly not in a big budget film like this! This was just preposterous!!<br/><br/>By the time the decent action arrived during the climax, I couldn't wait for the film to end. The climatic fight between Erik and Black Panther was also so painfully cliched and predictable - and then suddenly emotional (????!!!). 'Black Panther' toys with the viewer's emotions, but sadly this film didn't do anything for any of my senses. I hated this!"

Decided to give it a go again and same disappointment, I started to research the positive feedback the movie had recived. the further i got in my research i started to see a pattern , much of the hype the movie recived tend to had to do with the fact that an Africanamerican actor had the leadrole and the movie took part in uganda with intentions to help thouse in need like many other country are doing. some parts of the movie I enjoyed, and Chadwick Boseman is a brilliant actor, imo the movie should had focused on blackphanter and cut out the world piece to make Chadwick Boseman some sort of saint to some of audiences. I would rather see a movie with in more dept with the storyline focused on the whole blackphanter and vibrianion and how it all begain,"
"ncleasure","5","5","7","28 January 2019"," Overrated, Overhyped, Overcooked.
","If this were any other film, I would say, eh, nothing special, just another Marvel Studios crank-job. But this was not billed as just another Marvel movie, this was pushed out as the next big thing, the future of films. Every single critic was fawning over it like thier kid at the school play. However, when its metecritc score dropped below 100, everyone lost their minds. I actually found a post citing that white crtics gave it a bad review because of racism. Meanwhile the film has subpar acting from nearly half of the cast, the CGI in the first Iron Man (2008) was better, and there were so many plot-holes, I gave up an hour in. The rest of my family was done after the 30 minute mark. In addition to its technical faults, the film had no message, was rife with identity politics, and was generally bland. When I say identity politics, let me break it down. Nearly all warriors with the exception of the Black Panther are female, it portrays a charicature of African culture despite it being a hyper advanced society, American culture and ideals are made fun of at every opportunity and oh yeah, they had segregated screenings of it. Literally found a theater in town doing an early screening. When I showed up, the ticket office manager said the following. ""I'm sorry sir, I can't let you in, we are only accepting people of color today.""<br/><br/>This review will probably get removed for hate speech or some such other excuse, but it does not change the fact that it was a boring film that was heralded as the second coming."
"Joeybananas5","5","5","7","26 January 2019"," It grew on me....a little.
","First off, I'm a HUGE Marvel fan and a HUGE Black Panther fan, so I was really excited for this movie. Unfortunately, pretty much everything fell short of expectation. Maybe it was all the hype, maybe it was my own desire for it to be the next Ragnarok, but BP was far from it. I completely realize the cultural significance of the film, but I'm going to just focus on the movie itself, as I think the critics should have.<br/><br/>As far origin stories go, Black Panther has one of the more unique and interesting pasts. No radioactive spiders or aliens from a different dimension, just a fresh story with a ton of potential that was, unfortunately, wasted. I really wish the movie would have taken more time to focus on T'Challa BECOMING Black Panther and the personal struggles that surrounded it instead of focusing so much on Killmonger. While I enjoyed Michael B. Jordan's portrayal of Killmonger, I felt the character itself was written a bit too one-dimensional, with no real development over the film.<br/><br/>Next the CGI....ugh. Given the GAGILLIONS of dollars that Marvel puts into it's movies, there were some real issues with a few of the CGI scenes. Wakanda itself was beautiful, but a few of the action scenes really jumped the shark for me, especially with the war rhinos. That scene in-and-of-itself was enough to really stain the movie, but it was not the only one.<br/><br/>Lastly, the writing and acting felt a little stale. I realize that Wakanda is a monarchy that has been shut off from the outside world, so their social interactions would be different than the rest of society, but I still felt that they could have added a little flair to the dialogue and personality to the acting. Outside of Letitia Wright's portrayal of T'challa's sister, who's dialogue and performance really saved a lot of scenes, there was a lot of missed potential to create characters with a little more personality.<br/><br/>Overall, Black Panther was a miss, but there is still opportunity for redemption! As we saw with the first two Thor films, which were far more terrible, it is possible to come back to the same characters from a new perspective and really make something special. Unfortunatley, with the box office success of Black Panther, I fear that the studio will approach the subsequent films using the exact same formula, and we'll get more of the same."

"xmdbx","4","5","7","23 January 2019"," Just another superhero movie
","Black Panther is a joke of a movie. Killmonger was the least insane person in it and they killed him because he told the truth then took his ideas and passed them on as their own. These people hide the secrets to prosperity away from the world and call anyone who doesn't live with them an ""outsider"". They determine their leaders via either birthright or by combat (extremely advanced stuff from the Wakandans). Maybe if they didn't just pick the strongest guy they could have had a leader with morals make some positive changes to the world, instead their xenophobia causes them to sit and watch people suffer and die all over but they choose to save a hobbit just because. Then the hobbit flies a plane-ship simulation and takes out Killmonger's aerial force by himself and all this time another ship is trying to kill him. The movie sets it up as a life or death decision for Mr. Baggins; choose to stay in the simulation and die fighting or leave and let the enemy win. He chooses to stay and fight but somehow gets out in the nick of time anyways; just a complete waste of time to even present the illusion of risk. Oh, and how the hell is the hobbit supposed to know how much time he has left when he's told ""shields are at 50%"", what does that even mean? Black Panther is stabbed in the abdomen and thrown off a waterfall but survives because a fisherman finds him and puts him in a snow bank. Killmonger decides to burn the flower that gives him power for some reason that still escapes me. There are so many plot holes that I was questioning my own ability to comprehend story structure. I'd rather not even get started on the War-Rhinos. The use of CGI was liberal to say the absolute least. Of course, there were some parts that looked cool but there were way more parts that you could tell were shot in front of a green screen. Most of the accents are terrible and almost none of the actors/actresses offer anything in terms of emotion. I would say it's a shame some smarter nation is going to take advantage of them and their Vibranium but it's really not, they deserve it. Then again Wakanda does have deus ex machina on their side so they'll probably be alright."

Overall not a bad film but not sure what all the fuss is about."

"darkshadows1981","2","5","7","2 January 2019"," Really Marvel ... You Can Do Better
","No consistency in this film. Wakanda has great technology and people dress well in some parts but then look half poor and half rich in other poverty-appeared areas. So much technology but primitive weapons. This really made no sense, but that basically sums up most of the movie.
The movie itself is longer than it needed to be, and it was god awful boring. This is probably the worst Marvel movie they have ever made. No humor, poor character development, and the plot is not clear until 70% into the movie.
The cinematography was also inconsistent. At one point I thought I was watching Men in Black, another resembled The Fifth Element, and another resembled King Arthur. Video quality quickly went from one scene looking like a movie you expect to see in 2018 with amazing CGI then the next few scenes look straight out of an 80s film.
The film bounced around areas with no real purpose. One moment in space, then in the jungle, then in Korea, then back home. Why was T'Challa bouncing all over the place? This needs to be better explained. His backstory is also almost nonexistent except for his one battle in the beginning over what exactly between the two tribes? Leadership? Food? What? This needs to be explained more clearly.
The lack of clear explanation of anything is why I can't give this movie anything more than a 3. That is being generous."

The movie starts strongly with history of Wakanda and a captivating scene set in past. The world building of Wakanda is impressive in the beginning and it immediately generate interest in this fictional nation. Sad part is all your expectations turn to dissapointment when this movie becomes a generic affair with a very lazy story plot and predictable climax. Character of Shuri as Tachalla's brilliant sister is highlight of the film and rest of the cast is equally good. Movie has veen able to give depth to most of the characters and that is the strongest suits of the film. It is a shame that such characters are reduced to action figures rather than progressing the plot of the film. Film mention various issues faced by colored people which is the key motivation of villain Killmonger. When you expect a well thought off resolution of the central conflict of the film, all you get is punches, kicks and a lazy climax fight sequence. The most interesting premise or conflict raised in a MCU movie after winter soldier (privacy vs security) is resolved with 1 guy in suit fighting with another guy in suit in a cheap CGI battle (remember other numerous other MCU battles). I have no clue how can critics consider it an extremely good movie which will change landscape of superhero movies, it is strictly average at best. Good characters and an interesting premise are wasted and they can only take a movie this far with such a predictable script."

It's a step in the right direction for an increasingly out-dated and politically incorrect Hollywood, with arrogant 'white males' quivering in their seats. More than this, Black Panther is an incredible movie, more than a worthy addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>The aesthetics are inspiring, every inch of Wakanda utterly African, each scene evoking a strong and exemplary sense of Afrofuturism. Black Panther is absolutely committed to the African cultures it portrays and the effect is not only different, but visually stunning and incredibly colourful. More importantly, it never feels forced, gimmicky or frequently mentioned, constantly reminding people how PC they are. Instead the blend of African cultures embodied in Wakanda feels natural and organic and its detail is wonderful at every level.<br/><br/>In fact the aesthetics throughout the whole film are gorgeous. CGI, as expected in a film of this calibre, is second-to-none, but the cinematography alongside really captures the beauty of Wakanda, the wonders of a fictional technologically-advanced African country brought to life. Wakanda, stunning as it is, also feels fresh; Black Panther isn't just another superhero film with the titular character fighting their way across New York City. This freshness stretches throughout the whole movie, making it seem like a new kind of superhero film and putting to rest any doubts that Marvel's films could become stale or repetitive.<br/><br/>It is a Marvel film though so there are some aspects that we come to expect; some that are welcome and some that are happily missing in this movie. One is the comedy, which is abundant throughout Black Panther. With plenty of laughs from beginning to end - coming from M'Baku (Winston Duke) and Shuri in particular - it helps in allowing Black Panther to fit effortlessly into the broader personality of the MCU. Origin stories are also expected in superhero films, but here that is forgone, something that adds to its strength. It never gets bogged down in origins or unnecessary details explaining comic book lore; instead, like with Spider-Man: Homecoming, it just gets going and tells us what we need to know as it goes, letting exposition fit neatly into the film and never letting it slow down the pace. Superhero action too is worthy of praise as it is some of the best we've seen yet. With multiple films of this genre coming out every year, it's understandably becoming difficult to impress an audience. However Black Panther has a slightly more fresh approach to its action; not too deep-rooted in unrealistic sci-fi/fantasy, the action is fast-paced, fun to watch and brilliantly choreographed with varied action. This latter point is largely down to Black Panther being almost an ensemble film. While the focus of the story and a lot of the action is on T'Challa, he's not the sole interest of the film. Instead we often see him fighting alongside Nakia, Okoye and even sometimes Shuri. Each with different personalities as well as fighting styles, this lends a varied approach to the fight scenes and make them so much more interesting to watch. Yet the highlight is still the titular Black Panther, with expert martial arts and gymnastics blending together to be an absolute joy.<br/><br/>The joy doesn't stop with the action though. The quiet times are sometimes just as much fun, with the cast clearly having a blast. Chadwick Boseman builds on his debut in Captain America: Civil War, still retaining the characterisation from that film, but expanding it and making us love this character even more. Wise, strong and determined, he makes a fine King for Wadanda; but funny, sweet and loyal, he makes a fine superhero for the MCU. Boseman excels at bringing out all sides of T'Challa and we can't wait to see more of him in later this year with the rest of the MCU by his side. By his side this time though are a fine group of characters who could maybe even give the Avengers a run for their money. Okoye has a harsh-edge to her and watching her fight is incredible, yet Danai Gurira gives us a soft edge that she only reveals occasionally, making her enigmatic character more appealing. Letitia Wright and Lupita Nyong'o too bring so much personality to the film, often stealing scenes from the titular hero himself. Michael B. Jordan makes a worthy antagonist, actually being one of Marvel's best villains yet. Since their history of villains hasn't been great to date, you could assume that that isn't too high an accolade, but despite that he is a sympathetic villain with a likeable, funny side - the sort of villainy that made us all love Loki - supported by fellow bad guy, Andy Serkis returning as Klaue. Though not appearing much, he certainly makes his mark and lives up to the character's reputation. Martin Freeman's return as Ross is also very welcome and never a gimmicky, unnecessary reference to the wider MCU; instead he is allowed to develop a part that was too small in Civil War. This time he fits in organically and his American accent is as impressive as Andy Serkis' South African.<br/><br/>It's safe to say that all the hype for Black Panther was worth it because it really is everything we wanted it to be. With exciting and varied non-stop action, plenty of comedy and an excellent ensemble of characters it fits into the rest of the Marvel cannon seamlessly. And while this one forgoes the sometimes unnecessary origin story, dives into a great plot and actually gives us an enjoyable villain, the best thing that stands out about Black Panther is how fresh it feels and looks and how committed it is to the inclusion of African culture and inclusivity. Yet again Marvel have delivered another outstanding film that instantly soars towards the top of the list."

"TheLittleSongbird","6","18","35","5 March 2018"," Doesn't quite reign king
","Wanted to see 'Black Panther' for a while, one of my most anticipated films of this early half of 2018 and as somebody who likes to loves most of Marvel's films. The idea was interesting as was what the film was hyped up to be, the trailer looked great and the high ratings and critical acclaim promised even more. <br/><br/>My thoughts were that 'Black Panther' was a decent and intriguing film with a lot of very well done to great elements, but it didn't blow me away and left me disappointed after the hype. As indicated, far from hated it, didn't love it. Actually saw 'Black Panther' on opening weekend in a sold out showing (it was touch and go as to whether a ticket could be gotten), but had to properly form my thoughts for a while and was nervous seeing the very divisive IMDb reaction and the condescension on both sides (mostly negative), which has slightly died down since to feel less nervous.<br/><br/>Starting with the good/great things, 'Black Panther' is mostly impressive visually. The special effects were variable, but there were some spectacular ones, while it's beautifully and stylishly shot, slickly edited and sumptuously costumed. It's the extraordinary production design that was most note-worthy. Loved the use of technology, which was really cool. The music has the right amount of haunting intensity, energy, dignity and pathos, so a fine score on its own but not always utilised right in the film, a few ill-fitting moments mood-wise.<br/><br/>Much of the action is exciting, though there could have been more, and there is a good deal of thought-provoking script-writing with some nicely injected humour. One is immersed in the world of Wakanda, which is a fascinating world in thematic terms. The story does grip once it gets going and doesn't feel as confused and jumpy, with timeline and location changes needing to be clearer, like it did to begin with and a lot of it even when turning our everyday struggles on their heads is surprisingly relevant. <br/><br/>Personally thought that much of the acting was good, with a very charismatic lead performance from Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan bringing a self-loathing conflicted edge and swagger to Killmonger and Andy Serkis relishing his role with aplomb. The women are just as good, with a dignified Lupita Nyong'o, regal, no-nonsense and feisty Danai Gurira and particularly a funny and endearing Letitia Wright. While his role is small, Daniel Kaluuya is great fun in it. Direction is above competent, if not innovative, and really appreciated the film making Killmonger more than the standard Marvel villain, here one with questionable personal motives but one where one can see his point of view and empathise. Although his actions are inconsistent and don't always make sense and he could have been more threatening, generally he is one of the better Marvel villains and the most developed character in a film too full of stock ones (the titular character being the other exception). <br/><br/>'Black Panther' has faults however. Most of the characters are stock and clichÃ©d, while some of the first half is too talky, the film is a little slow-going and confused to start with and some of the political elements are laid on too thick. Adding to the general feel that, even with the splashes of humour, the film takes itself too seriously and with the amount of predictability it has doesn't do enough new with a novel concept. <br/><br/>There are exceptions to the cast. Forrest Whittaker is wasted as a non-developed character with too short screen time, on top of the scene being rushed his final scene has no impact as a result. Martin Freeman is too fish out of water as well. <br/><br/>Although some of the effects are spectacular, others are very ropy. Especially in the final action scene between Black Panther and Killmonger which resembled a very early days/years video game. That scene also felt rushed, sometimes vaguely choreographed and anti-climactic, though the whole climax felt over-stuffed and too busy. <br/><br/>Overall, decent and interesting but was expecting more. Personally don't think it's the best Marvel film, while a long way from bad let alone terrible, for me it's one of the weaker ones. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

","Well what can you say about this mess, the critics have obviously felt pressured into liking this movie for some reason or another, and they are going to cost a lot of people their hard earned money, and give most of them a huge disappointment. I love marvel super hero movies, this was a B-movie at best, like something swept up from the cutting room floor and thrown out the door. Under any other circumstance this movie would never be released, it is completely sub-par for marvel's current high standards. Representations of Africa and Africans were childish, cartoonish and patronising, and reminded me of 1920s safari brochures or victorian era stereotype propaganda, just a farce. A missed opportunity and once the real reviews start making the headlines and word of mouth spreads as to how bad the acting, story and dialogue are, it will single handedly destroy any chance of a similar film being released for the next 20 years. Just a boring movie, very poor quality for marvel and total disappointment.

To make up for this ""handicap"", the fighting scenes are cut every 2 second resulting in a chaotic mishmash.

","Logic? Motivation? Any connection to a real world human behavior? No! I can characterize this movie as a mix of cliches, nonsense and crystal meth.
Don't even get me started about all this pseudo sci-fi garbage Marvell puts into their movies these days. But let's rather talk about story and characters. The whole conflict in this story is created out of nothing for the sake of having a conflict. Without this conflict the story is absolutely empty. I wasn't able to watch this movie without facepalming every 5min over another ""unexpected twist"" or stupid dialogue. Characters are incredibly dull with no personality or real motivation. It's that black guy, this black guy and those black women. And don't get me wrong, I'm no racist, I'm talking about characters. The villain is evil and angry at the whole world for no damn reason whatsoever and his appearance is a freaking joke. The protagonist is an impotent, not worthy to be a king. Supposedly he was trained for this task his whole life, but when his time came, he end up being weak in both body and soul. The leader supposed to command respect, but how someone with no balls to do what must be done can command respect is beyond my understanding. The whole their city, or whatever it is, looks something Snoop Dogg, or whatever his name currently is, would have built after smoking too much weeds. The whole this ""super-advanced society right under everyone's noses"" thing is laughable on it's own. Even special effects are lame at certain points, but even those, that are not, are totally incapable of saving this catastrophe. We are so used to special effects, they no longer look like something special and capable of carrying he whole damn movie. Almost forgot about boss fights. You know why? They are so lame, you will never be able to recall them the next day after watching this."

I thought the actors were totally unbelievable, like they were in a high school play or something. The story was drawn out and could be condensed to half the duration of the film and the story was not interesting. The only character that was half believable was the villain. Such a shame because when we got a glimpse of Black Panther in Winter Solider, I so wanted to see this film. <br/><br/>I don't usually write reviews, but because this film has been hyped up to be a masterpiece, I felt like I had to chime in a lay waste to that claim. Even the kids in the cinema looked bored. I love many ""black"" movies, a lot of which are classics in my opinion and truly brilliant movies. This was not one of them. Blade (1997) for example urinates all over this film in every way.

","After finally watching the movie I'm incredibly disappointed. I don't understand how this is so highly praised by both critics and audiences.<br/><br/>I cringed throughout most of the movie. Let's leave aside all the plot holes and other nonsense. I found the portrayal of black people in this movie downright insulting.<br/><br/>The movie is desperately trying to be PC. But the superior black Wakandan race in the movie is insanely stereotypical. I mean, skip all the weird nonsense about this superior, warrior, genius race of black people hiding all their superior tech from the ""colonizers"" and others.<br/><br/>From the accents to the dancing it's revoltingly insultinging towards black people. It's like some white dude thought of the most stereotypical stuff he could imagine about black people. Then watched a few documentaries about remote African tribes and mixed them all together. I was waiting for them to start yelling ""UGA BUGA"" it was insane. The only reason why this movie isn't slammed into the ground for being incredibly tackles, is because the black people in this imaginary country are basically a superior race. But for some reason they still fight with spears, have stereotypical accents, bones trough their noses and plates trough their lips, as if they are some backward tribe. Why don't they have guns? Why the accents? No other group of people in these super hero movies have such accents. Thor doesn't speak with a stereotypical Norse accent and his people aren't all white. Why do they base their king on who is the strongest? Why do they constantly do weird stereotypical dances with literally everything. Every time they all meet everyone starts to shake their body while making weird noises, barking etc.<br/><br/>
OK.. Humor me for a second. Imagine if they make a movie about an Asian hero and call it ""yellow tiger"". The hero comes from a superior Asian race and their culture is a mix of the most stereotyped parts of all kinds of different Asian peoples and they all speak ""Engrish"" with a heavy ""Asian"" accent, walk around in straw hats, bow after every sentence etc etc. Can you imagine how insulting that would be for Asians?<br/><br/>
Also movie takes this weird American idea of ""black people"" like all black people are the same ethnicity / group. Eventhough, like Europeans, Asians, MENA people's they are all different people with different cultures, traditions, languages and values.<br/><br/>
I cringed trough every second of this movie. They could have made the Wakandans distinctly African without having to resort to dumb stereotypes.<br/><br/>HO and this one part was INSANE. The Wakandans don't want to help other black Africans or humans in general (but they emphasize black people). Because they don't want refugees and don't want their country to become ""like anywhere else in the world"" (paraphrasing). So much for multi culturalism, humanism and helping those less fortunate."
"AndrewM200019","5","6","9","8 March 2019"," Boring, Forced, and Mediocre
","The movie was just mediocre. It's ridiculously overrated, and everyone knows why at this point. The movie, just like a decent amount of other marvel movies, is predictable, boring, and bland. Lets start with some good things about the movie. The setup of Wakanda in the movie is just amazing. The detail, the environment, the costume design, and just everything about it is just great. This is the strongest thing about the movie. I also think that Chadwick does a phenomenal job with his acting, and you can feel his pain and anger, which is great. Now for the negatives. The movie is just boring. The pacing is odd, there's many scenes that I feel are just ridiculous, don't make sense, or just seem unnatural. Kilmonger's writing was awful, and made you feel barely any remorse for him, after going what he's been through. instead of seeming like an angry yet innocent person, looking to fix what he feels the wakandans (i dont know what you call them) caused, he comes off as just a forced, weak, and just bland villain. The movie seemed pretty robotic to me at points, which made it feel very unnatural, and ruined my enjoyment. It's just not that good. Lastly, the CGI in the movie was just outright garbage. I don't know what they did, but somehow between the trailers and the movie, the CGI looked worse. Adding that weird glowing purple armor made any fight scene involving T'Challa look like it was from an early 2010s video game. It looked so fake, and just so bad. Some other effects, mainly during the car scene were just bad. Considering the budget of the movie, compared to other movies like Doctor Strange and Thor Ragnarok, it just looks terrible, and unfinished. The movie is just overrated, bland, and way too long for its own good. There are way better marvel movies, and this is a movie going into the lower end of the marvel movie rankings.

Where were the scenes that saw black panther kicking ass, where were the scenes that showed his character develop, that showed the other character's arc? Where were the fight scenes that should have blown my mind away? Where was the story that had suspense and plot twists? Those things were absent from this film. There was only one funny scene. This film is quite dull and borING.

","aA smartly executed business gimmick (which is now $500million) to serve a blend of the undisputed favourite, DC's Bruce Wayne on top of yesteryears' critically acclaimed academy award winners 12 Years A Slave and Moonlight, which compassionately dealt with the prejudice against the community. 
Yet, Black Panther fails to give me a high.
The movie makers weren't sure whether they wanted to cash in over the geo-political happenings around the world or to honestly bring us entertainment. Unfortunately, it still manages to be self proclaimed best marvel, in fact the best superhero movie, as far as the B.O. numbers are going to due hype created by professional and politically influenced critics.<br/><br/>Its neither the first black superhero movie (wait! wasn't Hancock a superhero?)
nor the first movie with an entire black cast(what about Straight Outta Compton?). 
Besides, for covering up the ""blurry stationary flaws"", they say that one shouldn't judge it as it deals with elevating the oppressed. Really?<br/><br/>My dear friends! there is no such thing as ""upliftment of the downtrodden"" or ""being champion of the underdog"" in these 2 hours. Instead, if the film is losing something, its the emotions.<br/><br/>On contrary to your presumption, here King T'Challa, throughout his spectacle, is obsessed with trying to set up his monarchy over Wakanda. He ensures that no outsider, no matter who he is, ascends the throne. The only moment you see a righteous statesman in him, is when you see him confronting his father for murdering his uncle.
The antagonist, in contrast, depicts an orphan, poor, homeless and unguided kid with a motive, which although disturbing, forces us to relate him with an underdog.<br/><br/>If kids are looking out to watch this movie to gain self confidence to deal with social taboos, I suggest them to better see documentaries/videos of modern day achievers like Serena, Usain or Oprah, who tackled the taboos which an average black youth faces every day.
Coming back to the movie, the only praiseworthy thing I felt is the strong portrayal of female characters, which seem no lesser than the protagonist. The only place where they find themselves behind the protagonist, is in the title of the movie."

I did however rate is with 1, so that the grate can reach a rating that is closer to the one this movie deserves. Not based on the fact that people tend to rate this movie based on the politics and ethnic racial war (which should never, ever interfere with any movie in general), but for what the movie really offers to it's fans. There are better movies out there that are rated way worse than this one. If you objectively look at this movie, you can see that is not worth more than a 6.5. Maybe if you are a MARVEL fan a 7. That's because the movie was lacking in action. The movie wasn't too much about the Black Panther but the tech that he had. The character didn't had the space to built itself which is such a shame considering the fact that that was what the movie was all about!! It would have been awesome to see more action from the panther, to have scenes where you can see all those amazing skills that he posses..the movie had the space to make this hero look way cooler that it did. Shame..."

A dull origin story that merely set a location for the final fight in Infinity War. I can't figure out what role he will fill when the next phase takes off.

"tash_goldie","4","7","11","1 January 2019"," Vastly overrated
","I want to start this review by stating that I am not American, so the racial/cultural impact this movie was not something that I can really relate to and as such I am rating this movie for its own merits rather than what it represents.<br/><br/>Is it a bad movie? No. The acting is great, the costumes are gorgeous, the protagonists have depth, and the scenery is at times breathtaking. I don't think it deserves all these one-star reviews.<br/><br/>Is it a great movie? ...No. The plot is fairly predictable and formulaic, the use of 'vibranium' to solve every issue that arises feels a little cheap, and the main villain is fairly cliche.<br/><br/>Most importantly, for me this movie was missing the one element that Marvel movies have consistently delivered: it just wasn't fun. There's very little of the humour that we're used to seeing, there's no surprising plot twists, and the action scenes are at best so-so and at worst an onslaught of terrible CGI that would look out of date 10 years ago.<br/><br/>So all in all: watch it once if you're a Marvel fan or if you are interested in the cultural impact side of things. But if you're a casual movie-goer just looking to relax and enjoy yourself for a fun few hours, try Spider-Man: Homecoming or Thor: Ragnarok instead. This is one MCU movie I won't bother rewatching."

The movie makes use of what is basically BLM propaganda as the villain's agenda and I feel this has been done to try and evade harsh critical reviews, what a shame! Andy Serkis was just too brilliant, sadly the movie doesn't revolve around him. Countless cringe worthy moments as a result of poor dialogue writing. The romantic sub plot just doesn't work.

I would go as far to say that it is on the lower end of the spectrum from films from the MCU. This movie simply isn't good, but it isn't horrible either. It certainly has its somewhat redeeming qualities: The cinematography is masterful at times combined with the amazing CGI and set pieces make it a pleasure to look at. As well as the amazing acting/actors. But honestly I expected more from Ryan Coogler as he had in the past directed some great movies such as Creed. But even all of these amazing qualities weren't enough to make the film good. The storyline was lackluster with boring and predictable character archs which go nowhere giving the feeling of no development really being made by the end of the movie. Although some action scenes were good due to the quality CGI, the fight scenes were extremely mediocre and uninspired and became quite repetative at times. Though the weapons and gadgets used were quite col which made the fights a little more fun, but more of these should have been used to make these otherwise boring fight scenes more interesting so they don't seem to drag on as much.

The concept is great, but I just didn't feel like there was adequate character development to get you really invested in the ideological clash and manner of resolution they were working toward. For that reason I didn't leave feeling as uplifted as I could have for the theme that was used. It was just kind of, ""oh, alright...well he's a really decent human being."" I've read reviews that call this the best Marvel movie ever, those are NOT credible critics. There's no way.

The villain of the film could have been better too. <br/><br/>I think this movie could have benefited by connecting it more to the MCU - perhaps having a secondary hero like Bucky, or any applicable ones from Civil War play a role in this films plot. <br/><br/>I understand there was a heavy political message behind the film, which is great, but in terms of a super hero movie, I felt this was the worst BY FAR at least in terms of the MCU."

Not only do they keep the formula of making the villain the hero's mirror opposite (which works more times than not) but the filmmakers try real hard for you to like, pity and feel sorry for such a horribly designed character whose main trait is being an awful, petty and vengeful human being.<br/><br/>There is no real substance to the movie unless you wanna be deeply immerse into race politics, not my cup of tea to be honest.

Black Panther first appeared in ""Captain America: Civil War"", with Chadwick Boseman donning the suit of Black Panther, and alter-ego T'Challa, King of Wakanda, a technologically advanced nation hidden in the African continent. After the death of his father, T'Challa, son of T'Chaka, the King, takes the place of the throne, faced with obstacles as soon as he is initiated. <br/><br/>Andy Serkis plays Ulysses Klaue, a mercenary stealing technology from Wakanda and selling it, is one of the main antagonists of the picture, giving a fantastic performance as a nonchalant, cockney thief, escaping the claws of the previous king, and now hunted by Boseman. In fact, what makes this film stand-out, is the back-up cast. The sister of T'Challa, played by Letitia Wright, and a clan leader, played by Winston Duke, are two characters who particularly stand-out, and serve as comic-relief for parts of the film. Whereas on the other side of the film, with Chadwick Boseman, are phenomenal pieces of lightning and choreography in a lot of his early battle sequences, paired with a purple-glowing suit (possibly the best suit produced by the MCU for any hero), any action sequence featuring him is exciting and awesome, especially the early battles, where the audience is introduced to the power of the Black Panther, discovering just why this guy is a hero. <br/><br/>Speaking of costumes, the costumes of the citizens of Wakanda all vary in colour, being interesting and obviously well made. Despite this, it seems as if the costumes are trying to ""spread the colour"" with some, obviously blatant scenes of (costume) colour segregation. This is not helped by CGI which is successful for the majority, but falls short at the scenes of actual animal life, i.e. rhinos. Even though ""Black Panther"" is home to some of the best choreography for a Marvel film, the script lets itself down, with a dragged out plot and unnecessary sequences of ""falling only to rise once more"" (both literally and metaphorically). <br/><br/>From the get go, one thinks, this is close to being one of the best Marvel films of all time, but, short of falling flat on its face, it stumbles over its own plot annoyances, making it equal to ""Doctor Strange"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2"" when it had the capability to surpass ""Captain America: Civil War"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (although it would have had to be extremely good for that to happen)."

","Th critics are either liars our were paid to say this was the best Marvel Movie, tis film comes NOWHERE CLOSE to films like the original Iron Man, Deadpool, or Logan. This was definitely an attempt the fashionable diversity quotas in Hollywood nowadays. Other than the ooh aah special effects, this film offered little substance than what was already on the surface. I get it, powerful African Americans and females are popular right now but this film just shoves it in your face, I was really turned off by it. I considered leaving the film about halfway through but figured I payed for it, might as well finish it.<br/><br/>As I said the spectacles were are as to be expected with the wild high budgets of Marvel films. With that it had some unique special effects and wild rides that I suppose are worth the price of admission. But th story is just atrocious, poorly written and really did not suck me in. During scenes of dialogue I rolled my eyes and just waited for the next sequence of special effects. And again, I've got no problem with films about minority culture, I find them very interesting, but this was just in your face propaganda, it was just so terrible, I was truly turned off this film.<br/><br/>I would say skip this trash."

","I was disappointed especially after all the positive reviews. What is with critics?? I am noticing that they give all blockbusters 10/10s and the like!!<br/><br/>Next to the very stupid and boring new 'Star Wars' this is the worst though. The film is quite boring to start and wastes the potential to educate or entertain. Especially with its African setting it could have taught the audience a thing or two. Instead, we learn nothing, the fights are stupid and weak, there s little action overall and only the last 15 minutes are watchable. It is not worth $15 for the last 15 minutes in my opinion however. I did like the music however. So 4/10.<br/><br/>I am still scratching my head at all the awful films the critics keep giving thumbs up to. Think this boring and underdeveloped film, think the last two so-called Star Wars, think Blade Runner 2049. There are still good films out there (The Gifted, Get Out, Captain Fantastic), but the hype goes to the wrong movies.
Perhaps it is time for Marvel and Disney to retire. Who knows?"
"zachbcollins","2","21","43","27 April 2018"," One of the most disappointing MCU movies.
","Black Panther was not a good movie. I don't care about the political message. I agree with it. Everyone should be treated equally, and we should be helping out other people whenever we have the ability to do so. However, just because the political or social message was good, doesn't mean the movie was good. It simply means the message was. I was actually super excited to see lack panther. However, after watching it, there were a lot of problems with it. <br/><br/>1. The CGI was terrible. It was barely above the level of the amazing Spider-Man series. <br/><br/>2. It contributed barely anything to the MCU plot. Simply that they have have a ton of tech and <br/><br/>3. They did a terrible job of making it realistic. From the ridiculous ""silent shoes"" to the fact that what is essentially Atlantis has been sitting in plain sight, the directors did a bad job of making it realistic. <br/><br/>4. Bad characters. Almost none of the characters were interesting or likable enough to actually care about. With his sister and the villain being the only exceptions. I actually almost wanted the villain to win because he was basically the only one I liked or actually felt for at all. <br/><br/>5. It was outright boring. There was barely any plot till most of the way through the movie, and what little action there was was slow, unrealistic, and uninteresting.<br/><br/>6. Black Panther is OP. Essentially if it wasn't for the monorail system, both of them would've been indestructible, and essentially invincible. There is no limit to the power of black panther, so it's not cool to watch. Just like Superman, and debatably vision, they're so powerful, they're not cool. <br/><br/>TL;DR: Basically, boiled down, I don't give a crap whether a movie is about a girl or guy or black person or white person or whatever. A movie is good because it's a good movie. Because it has good characters, plot, etc. - not because of it's main character's gender or race, and not because of the social message, no matter how good that message is."

"cliff_bd","6","30","65","19 February 2018"," Good action movie let down by a poor story.....again
","****Spoiler Alert ***** DO NOT read if you don't want to know the story line! <br/><br/>Black Panther had loads of potential, mainly due to the fact that the Super hero was not from America. I'm not saying that I don't like Super heroes from America, I do and I love them, however, the with BP film makers had a different back story to work with and had a real opportunity to produce something really creative and really different within the Marvel Universe; but did they? .....No!<br/><br/>The story writers kept the film within a safe and regularly used story line frame work. Here's the frame work:
1. The parent (mother or Father) keeps some dark secret from the the son/daughter.
2. The parents(s) wanted to tell their off spring but never did, due to either dying or being killed earlier than they anticipated.
3. Throw in some dangerous element or threat or villain.... in this case the metal Vibranium which some bad guys are after and fill a portion of the film with chase scenes and explosions.
4. Then go back to the dark secret... in this case the father killed the brother and left the brothers son in American
5. The brothers son grows up vowing to take his bitter revenge.
5. The bitter revenge is then taken by the son and tries to kill our hero in this case its BP. Everyone thinks hes dead ....but hes not!! (Surprise!!)
6. Our hero (BP) goes to a his life time enemies (in this case the Ape tribe in Wakanda) to asks them for help (the life time rivalry could be a rival gang or child friend who he/she fell out with due a fight over a girl or money... in this case its the Vibranium)
7. The life time enemies say No, No way will I ever help you!!....... But guess what they come to save the day, just in the nick of time....
8. They all live happily ever after!<br/><br/>Hollywood on occasion put movies that breaks the above framework and other similar frameworks... but it is rare and Black Panther is most certainly not one of the exceptions and unfortunately, has its fundamental story line built solidly within the framework.<br/><br/>Did I like the movie, Yes. Did I love the movie, ""almost"".... I love Marvel and DC (Ok ... I'm a sucker for the genre)<br/><br/>My Point is this - Hollywood spends billions developing CGI and non CGI special effects ever year - it is high time that they start investing the same time and effort to create a rich and original story line that justifies the budget of the movie"

","As a fan of the character and everything Marvel, I was looking forward to this and even pre-ordered the Blu-ray before going to the cinema.
Having been to the cinema I have now cancelled the Blu-Ray, this is not a movie I would want to watch again.
Andy Serkis played a good villain which makes for a promising start, but after he meets an untimely end there is nothing else to redeem it.
The story is shallow, the final battle sequence is so predictable.
If the films box office figures are to be believed, it can only be because fans of the genre don't want to miss anything that will lead into Infinity War - they don't need to worry, this is purely a stand alone movie.
Black Panther is such a good character, it's a shame they couldn't have developed him with a decent storyline after his successful introduction in Civil War.

I blame the story writers who wrote up an attempt at substance and completely side stepped action (in the whole movie, you only see 2 action scenes including the Black Panther (in character), for the rest its just filler and ""drama"")<br/><br/>The antagonist appears out of nowhere and takes the throne he deserves, by winning all too easily in a non-super fight. To this T'challa thinks he is right to claim revenge and take his throne back .. even though he lost it fair and square (true, he neither died or surrendered, but he did black out and lost). But hey, apparently getting rid of 'the' immigrant seems to supersede honor. Am I the only one who noticed the parallel between the antagonist's plan of arming the globally disenfranchised with weapons and US foreign policy for these past many decades? Yet this seems to be a good enough reason for wanting him off the throne. That and he's a foreigner (something 'disturbing' enough that the Jabari tribe decide to come down from their mountains in order to help Black Panther).
I don't think the movie sends out the right messages.<br/><br/>Great potential but none of it was tapped, at all. Complete waste of time.

Only this fact indicates the quality of the directing and acting.<br/><br/>Literally, this movie should be called ""Killmonger"" and centered about Michael B.Jordan character - definitely, he has potential and Coogler knows, how to handle the actor and boost his performance. But Jordan has less screen time, then he deserves, and this fact flattened down the character to some stupid angry kid with world domination ambitions. Nobody, for some reason, reminded him, that truly free person does not want to own slaves. <br/><br/>We again have the antagonist, that have similar powers with protagonist. We again have a couple between main hero & Lupita's character with zero chemistry between them. Seriously, interaction between BP & his sister are much more enjoyable.

Filmmakers were so scared to offend someone, that character Man-Ape was referenced only by name (M'Baku) and was portrayed without his iconic ape suit.<br/><br/>We have a future-tech, rich and powerful hidden country, where king is being selected in a direct battle. Trump vs Clinton! Who wins? A small country silently decides to take the whole world just because a random guy with royal blood appeared from nowhere and ordered this monstrosity, only a small amount of rebels does not agree. Of course, other countries does not have intelligence agencies, atomic bombs and all word population can be controlled by Wakandians, especially ex-USSR, Arabic World, China, India and Asia. Civil war with blades and spears? Without beam / projectile weapons? No, we have BATTLE RHINOS! Too many plot holes and assumptions - even for a comic book movie.<br/><br/>Two white guys - Lee and Kirby - invented the character long ago. Right now Coogler and Marvel missed the opportunity to present a really fresh, interesting story involving Black Panther - this is really sad, I was hoping (after Civil War) to see a movie without dozens of cliches and copypaste work.

He fails in every other aspect. Whilst striving so hard to bring a 'minority' people to the ticket booth - all 2 billion as they say in the movie - he has done a tasteless disservice to white africans, allowing dialogue such as ""colonists"" and ""another white person that needs fixing"" to permeate the film. This somewhat racist leaning language is interspersed by easily the most stereotypical and completely absurd wannabe African accents from actors with no idea how to do it correctly. Compounding this is Hollywood's go-to bad guy in all things African, the big, white, Afrikaans accented man that eventually gets killed, but not before telling how awful the people of an African country are. Capitalising on yet another poor stereotype is the Wakandan's use of armoured Rhinoceroses, because nothing says conservation of an almost entirely extinct species with poor eyesight like strapping armour to it and charging it into battle. <br/><br/>

I feel with many other Marvel movies they try to at least make the characters and concepts somewhat plausible but this one fell short.<br/><br/>I mean ok I can accept that they got their power from vibranium which came from a meteor but like it didn't give any feeling of how they utilised it to the extent they had and Shuri just seemed so wooden. She looks like 16 or not much older and is supposed to be super intelligent tech woman with all this out of this world stuff, but she did not come across as a believable character in her field of expertise. She just came across like a teen who tried too hard to be funny. I mean at least with Tony Stark and Bruce Banner you get a feel for why they are so clever.<br/><br/>Also the villain was bland and I was hoping for more street action outside Wakanda and many of the Wakanda people seemed flaky, like W'kabi. Some of the African accents were a bit off too.<br/><br/>If you like most Marvel movies you will still probably enjoy it but don't expect it to be as good as the hype makes it out to be."

","After the excellent.....and hilarious.....Thor 3, I was rather looking forward to this. Positive reviews had also whetted the appetite. Perhaps it was the expectation that undermined the enjoyment?<br/><br/>The genre is a little hard to quantify, but it reminded a lot of Wonder Woman. Except, instead of the WW2 setting, we had a kind of Bond-style thriller instead, complete with ridiculous gadgets and under-developed baddies.<br/><br/>The film looks great (some dodgy CGI aside) - I liked the armour, weaponry and cultural aesthetics. I also felt a lot of the performances were quite compelling. Unfortunately, it is all rather dull. And doesn't feature anything we haven't seen before. <br/><br/>What is most disappointing, is that it doesn't seem to tie into the Marvel continuity at all (apart from the unremarkable Everett Ross, who appeared from nowhere in Civil War and is a poor attempt to replace Agent Coulson). Like Wonder Woman, this is simply a ""Black Panther tale"" and you can take it or leave it when embarking on your next Marvel marathon.<br/><br/>I also found the advanced technology to be completely over the top. Weapons and armour, I can understand. Miracle healing and Panther suits concealed within necklace teeth is VERY hard to swallow indeed. Vibranium was an indestructible Alien metal that could absorb sound. Fair enough. Great material for weapons and armour. But spaceships and miracle healing? Really? Couldn't we have toned it down just a little?<br/><br/>I was bored. My friend was bored. After his wonderful debut in Civil War, this was a bit of a wasted opportunity."
"Mohican15","5","39","89","17 February 2018"," The Mother Of All Bad Finales!
","I went into BLACK PANTHER with high expectations and looking forward to a fresh and exciting new MCU franchise and for most of the film that was what I got. BLACK PANTHER began as a fun, new, superhero adventure romp with good acting, a fairly decent plot and brilliant visuals. Director Ryan Coogler, for the story of BLACK PANTHER has combined the old, tribal customs of Africa with fresh, new, brilliant technology and a mother load of vibraniam to create a fascinating MCU world. Wakanda is an amazingly colourful world brought to life with the great visual effects and natural scenery. It's looks almost like an African version of Coruscant from STAR WARS. <br/><br/>The casting for the most part in this film is brilliant and almost every member is on great form and doing their uttermost. Boseman is obviously the main highlight in this film and gives a very convincing performance as T'Challa. We only caught a small glimpse of his true talent as Black Panther in CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. In this film we get a much more thorough and fascinating look at the character with Boseman playing all his characteristics and emotions brilliantly and becoming a real hero we can care about. He's brilliantly complex and multi-layered and a very fun character to spend time with. The rest of the cast is on top form with the likes of Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira and several others. They gave real life to the characters and made them fun and interesting. There was one rather silly performance: Michael B. Jordan as the movie's main villain Erik Killmonger. It's not really his fault, it's more the writing. Killmonger as a character and as a villain is completely bland and two-dimensional. Jordan tries his best to save the role and make it convincing, but turns the part into more of a shouting act. On the other hand, it's disappointing that the great Andy Serkis is only made a MINOR villain as Ulysses Klaue. His character is dynamic, fun and really pops so it's a shame that he's ""offed"" so early.<br/><br/>Now, onto one of the good things but also the problem of this film: the plot. To start, it's fun, action-packed and very entertaining. Coogler choreographs really brilliant action scenes that feel almost like something out of THE MATRIX at some points. It's a great ride with fairly fun characters and that's all great until we get into the 3rd ACT. The finale is possibly one of the worst endings to a movie I've ever seen and takes a real dump on the whole movie! It's so lazy and stupid and goes WAY beyond the far-fetched antics of the beginning with laser ships, giant rhinos and a VERY disappointing sci-fi battle on the planes. I'm not just saying this because it's set in Africa and involves big cats but the ending is THE LION KING on acid and not in a good way. The whole final battle revolves around Killmonger's plan and it's just SO silly and pointless and frankly something one would expect from the Red Skull. Danai Gurira as Okoye leads her warriors against the villains on the plains and it quickly turns into pure spear porn. The sins of this ending were just SO terrible and it was impossible to overlook them, and this sadly dragged the film down terribly and made it a convoluted, silly, sci-fi mishmash that ruined a perfectly good movie premise. This was a real disappointment when I had such hopes for this movie and had enjoyed it so far.<br/><br/>Here's what I say: enjoy Black Panther's role in CIVIL WAR and leave it at that!"
"Bendara","1","19","39","31 March 2018"," Boring and predictable. Typical Marvel Movie
","I wasted my time with this movie, as I have with other super hero movies of late. The characterisation of Black Panther, as with Ironman, Thor, The Avengers, et al, is simple to say the least. There is no character depth and the plot in BP was as weak as any of the others. The only thing going for these genre films is special effects, which when broken down may look good, but are totally divorced from reality."
"alvmanalm","5","19","39","21 February 2018"," Lukewarm
","Not bad, but not good: lukewarm.<br/><br/>The storyline is relatively faithful to the Black Panther's origins story (mutatis mutandis), so one is not disappointed there, although in some moments the movie looks like a (bad) combination between Coming to America (1988) and The Lion King (1994).<br/><br/>Some of the actors overact. This may be due to two things: too much green screen in the back and a poor strategy concerning the languages spoken by the characters throughout the movie. If possible, they could have invested more in the use of original african languages; the african/english accent doesn't work that well. Also, there's just too much CGI. With so much money, they could (should?) have invested in a trip to Africa to film on location, instead of just going to South Korea.<br/><br/>Character development was somewhat forgotten. Characters are not that deep and are actually kind of accidental sometimes.<br/><br/>A word on fight coreographies. Should have been much better! When first appearing on Captain America: Civil War, Blach Panther proved to be a skilled fighter, with a kind of unique fighting style, rivalizing with Captain America himself and the Winter Soldier. Now, in this movie, however, he looks very ordinary, devoid of the one on one martial skills he displayed before.<br/><br/>Despite all this, I have to say two more things. One, the soundtrack is very good! All of it. Two, the depiction of Wakanda and the general african ambience, namely concerning some traditions and cultural aspects (real and/or fictional) deserve praise.<br/><br/>Bottom line: entertaining, not a total flop, but still not good enough. They didn't exaggerate on the jokes (although they were funny), fortunately, which is a point in favor - the movie wasn't a joke, contrary to some tendencies that have been going around lately (e.g. Guardians vol. 2, Thor Ragnarok); but there was some bad writing and some bad directing, I have to say."

The movie was very well acted with Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger being the standout in the cast. <br/><br/> The action and special affects were top flight..

For the life of me, I could not understand how anyone watching this film would rate it above a 6 or 7. The special effects were average but considering it was a Marvel film, it was downright awful. The fight scenes were edited into hundreds of 1-3 second clips and there was no sense of battle choreography like the other Marvel films. <br/><br/>There was also no time spent on character building. The people of Wakanda are the stiffest and most deadpan I have ever seen. Zero emotion and normal conversations are like speeches instead of banter. Marvel hit it big in its later movies introducing humor but this film has none at all. <br/><br/>Probably the most surprising that the media didn't warn anyone was that the ""Bad Guy"" felt the black population had been oppressed, so to make things right, he wanted to basically wipe out the white population in a genocide. This surprised and kind of insulted me - I've never oppressed anyone yet I am the target? Then Black Panther and his army tries to stop him more to protect Wakanda's secrecy than to stop a raving lunatic. <br/><br/>Saw this film with a friend and when the lights came up, our conversation was like this - my friend asked me what I thought and I said ""MEH.

","I apologize that this review might seem like a bit of a rant, but I haven't seen such an interesting idea get wasted like this since Avengers 2. <br/><br/>Plot:
This can easily be broken into two parts. The first half, which went way too slowly and was kind of useless, and the second half which seemed like a useless squabble. Everything before killmonger actually showed up in Wakanda seemed like a bunch of exposition to explain the events of the second half. Wakanda and its traditions, while cool, had way too many deus ex technologies that seemed to just support the events in the story rather than introducing the country's technological advancement or advancing its mythos. Mega healing medicine, need that to save freeman and T'chala. Monorail that absorbs the power of vibranium, yup that's how they'll defeat Killmonger. Challenging the King, used twice when T'Challa allows M'kabi to go free so he can magically save him later on, and to allow Killmonger to take over...<br/><br/>and this continues to happen outside of Wakanda too... Claw gets caught... oh that's to show T'Chala that Killmonger works with him and push him to ask about the ring... It seemed like they had a plan for him to get caught only to get busted out... FOR NO REASON!!!<br/><br/>Immediately after showing up, Killmonger challenges the king and he accepts. No one has any questions, concerns, or anything? Yes, let's let this random guy who shows up claiming to be the son of the King's brother, whom has never even been to Wakanda, take over the most advanced civilization in the without fully understanding their culture technology etc. Not to mention, the traditionalists side with him due to tradition and those looking for change are just like, yup, this will bring us into the new world. Let's just hand everything over to him...<br/><br/>Character motivations and ideologies also seemed all over the place. W'Kabi who at first looks to support T'Chala immediately defects because he wasn't able to capture claw? Considering T'Chaka attempted to do the same, and failed for 30 years prior, you'd think he'd be supportive and offer advice. Then once Killmonger shows up is like, yeah, he killed claw so I offer my undying allegiance to you, even over the one I call my love...<br/><br/>T'Chala, before opening up to the UN, just drops one of his ships into the middle of the ghetto just to show off to some kids...<br/><br/>Also, why are people so shocked by his ship? They've seen things like ironman, the invasion from aliens in Avengers 1, the robots in Part 2, villians like the vulture in Spiderman. Wouldn't they be more scared than anything considering most who have this kind of technology are villians? Wouldn't that make them spread the news instantly rather than possibly being an accessory to a villian. But he was nice, so we'll keep his secret. <br/><br/>I can go on and on... <br/><br/>Here's some things I would have liked to of seen.
Instead of just introducing Wakanda and Killmonger to us at the beginning, a better first half could have been spent following Killmonger and how he learns of Wakanda and its technology etc. That way when viewers finally get to see Wakanda, it really makes it seem like the mythological place it's talked about as and how he knows so much and more understandable as to why he wants to support others.<br/><br/>Instead of Having Killmonger work with claw to kill him, have him build trust within Wakanda, then kill Claw to prove how much of better leader he is. This would make him taking over much more understandable and show us that the revolutionists believe in his ability to lead, rather than the blind following they go with. <br/><br/>Have T'Chala offer Killmonger a place in Wakanda before dying. He's clearly open to change by this point and will need guidance. Why not take an adviser that sees all the problems from an outside perspective. Not only this, but wouldn't it make sense to rectify their fathers' mistakes and put the past behind?<br/><br/>GET RID OF MIRACLE MEDICINE. I'm not sure if this is part of the comics, but this should not exist at all. You have millions of people dying in places all around your country and your only answer is we need to keep it a secret. Yeah... better to keep that secret rather than help cure those aids epidemics happening all around you. Not only that, but clearly they don't offer aid to their people living outside of the border walls as shown at the beginning of the movie when he tells the captives to remain quiet about their rescue...<br/><br/>I'll end on this. I didn't absolutely hate the movie as there are some things to like. The country and tech is kinda cool, SOME characters really are interesting (i.e. Killmonger) but the decisions made in this film were just infuriating. I really hope they find a better writer for the sequels cause there is good opportunities for stories to be told here..."

""Black Pride"" is not a thing, and if it is, it is presented as a bad thing, as the only characters that exhibit it were Killmonger and M'Baku. <br/><br/>Ryan Coogler delivers on the story and characters, and you can see that careful thought was put into his vision and the script, however some of the technical aspects seem unfinished, and the humor was the worst out of any MCU film to date (humor is subjective).

","Black Panther is definitely a great movie and a must watch for superhero fans as well as marvel fans. I don't understand all the negative reviews, its obvious some are just DC fans hating on the movie and some people are just nitpicking very small things, but of course the movie does have flaws. I am a big Marvel fan and a very big fan of the MCU, when I go to see movies in theaters I normally have high expectations as many people do, with Black Panther I did as well. What makes a movie good is different between every single person though i have very high expectations as long as the movie has a good plot, great fight scenes and characters I will be impressed whether i have high expectations or not. <br/><br/>Black Panther had a good plot, it does not bore you and keeps you interested but it isn't unique it can be predictable and a bit cliche but throughout the movie i was very interested and wanted to carry on watching . The whole idea of ""Wakanda"" is great and is different from normal superhero movies.<br/><br/>Characters are very great in this movie, Chadwick Boseman's character T'Chala was great through out the whole movie, he showed that he wanted to be king and had great chemistry between other characters. Considering T'Chala was introduced in Civil War he's character was developed but through Black Panther he's character develops slowly. Chadwick Boseman once again was excellent playing the character. The Villain Erik Kill-Monger was really good he was intimidating and he's ambitions were clear, although it was slightly cliche he was fantastic! Michael B Jordan did an amazing job and acting was good throughout. I don't want to make this too long but characters had good chemistry between each others and are very likable.<br/><br/>To summarize this movie the plot was good,characters were fantastic because they had a good casting choice as well as brilliant chemistry among each other, fight scenes were bad ass and make you love the character BP even more.the jokes throughout this movie are not overused and not forced its just the good old marvel humor as well as the script was well written. Of course this movie did have it flaws the final fight scene between the protagonist and antagonist was disappointing and heavy CGI was used and it was obvious the characters were full CGI and the fight could have been much better. (also forgot to mention CGI was great in the movie at times it wasn't the best but shouldn't bother you) there was probably a few plot holes and predictable at times but didn't bother me too much.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was fantastic and you should watch it, of course there are flaws but to me it did not bother me and i was entertained throughout, as I said before we all look differently to movies I said I have high expectations and the movies flaws did not make the movie bad for me but that's usually for most movies. Go watch this movie, lives up to the hype and you will love the character BP more!"

No one said Ant-man, Thor The Dark World, justice league, Wonder Woman and Venom was overrated. It's actually underrated because of the amount of people calling it overrated. Black panther isn't your typical marvel film, it tells a symbolic story of power,pride, loyalty and honor. It's obvious we come from different lifestyles and won't be able to understand each other, cause your so used to having things your way and everything having to do about you that when you see something different you don't know how to act.. because it's out of your normal supremacy reach. Black panther has been a influential character in the Marvel comics since the 60s it was based on the comics. Blame Stan Lee A WHITE MAN for the story. All the racial bias this movie is receiving is why the movie is so successful you bunch of ignorant bashing fools, on top of the fact that it actually was a well made film it also circulates around an entire race of people, culture and continent exist. It envisions something that can and could be possible and it takes the viewers imagination to a different world that people enjoyed and it's a lot only cause it had an entire black cast as I read many ignorant people here saying. the fact that all of these negative people can't appreciate what Black Panther has meant to the world and are instead focused on their own ignorant biases scheme is sad. You can hate all you want but that doesn't change all the achievement it has won.<br/><br/>

I'm a easy audience for anything with superhero's, except of course for this one. It wasn't the message the grid to push that made me dislik it, it's simply a bad movie. <br/><br/>First the script. It's the lion king with superhero's. It was boring and slow. I don't need action ever second but the parts in between stages this movie to a complete halt. Second the acting. The two main roles were filled by actors that have no ability to hold your interest. No intensity, no presence, it's like they jus read their lines in the most cliche way possible. The directing and CGI were both off as well. <br/><br/>Needless to say the professional critics were either paid off or the just felt the HAD to give this movie good reviews.

","This movie was in no way the worst of all the Marvel films, but it does lack originality. I'm hearing many people say that this film is unique and separates itself from the rest of the marvel installments. I really don't know what they're on about. The plot is really generic. In a way it's as if we've all seen this film before, just rehashed with better, (well, ""better"" CGI). A man comes and visits his home to take the throne over his father's kingdom. Once he becomes king, another fellow family member decides to dethrone him (for his own reasons). The villain humiliates the protagonist, conquers the land for some time, and then the hero returns to kill him off. T'challa himself wasn't a very lovable character, I found him to be very bland and lacking of expressions. Kill monger is probably the reason this movie wasn't a complete catastrophe, although there wasn't anything particularly outstanding about him, he was quite charismatic and enjoyable to watch. I really couldn't care less about him dying in the end, seeing as if he was gone missing for like 50 minutes of the movie. Not only that, but let's be honest everyone saw it coming. This film was predictable from start to finish, maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it too much. The jokes were cheesy, maybe one or two landed. My final complaint was the pacing of the film. It all started really fast and then about 20 minutes in to halfway through the film, the movie was really slow. Not even the CGI could help make things better<br/><br/>
I only saw this film because I'm a Marvel fan, (or was from the previous movies). It really was what I expected though. Some cool action sequences, a predictable plot, typical cheesy Marvel jokes, and just another fill in for the continuation of the Avengers storyline."

"southdavid","7","17","35","19 February 2018"," Solid enough but not t'op drawer.
","The 18th film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is another solid entry to the franchise but It's a testament to how far Marvel have pushed the concept of a ""Superhero film"" in the last couple of years that ""Black Panther"", which would have been amazing as little as three years ago, now feels a bit out-dated. <br/><br/>Following the death of his father during ""Captain America: Civil War"", T'Challa returns to Wakanda to be crowned its new King. He discovers that agents both within and outside of his homeland believe that the country should be doing more with their advanced science and technology to help the oppressed around the world. At the same time, Wakanda's most wanted, the only man to see hidden treasures and escape its borders, Ulysses Klaue, commits a daring robbery and may finally be vulnerable to capture. <br/><br/>It's a beautiful looking film, and feels authentic to the region, even though Wakanda is a fictional land. Its debates about the morality of interference outside its feels like a genuine cause of conflict and Killmonger, excellently played by Michael B Jordan, is a villain whose motivation you believe in, even if the MCU's villain was/is family to the hero trope is again in force. <br/><br/>However, I did find myself feeling at times that it was a bit po-faced, especially when compared to last years near comedies of ""Spider-man: Homecoming"" and ""Thor Ragnorok"", though the times when it is funny, usually revolving around Letitia Wright as T'Challa's younger sister - Shuri - usually hit the mark. <br/><br/>Another criticism I'd have for the film would be the editing, particularly in the earlier fight scenes. Modern action films are plagued by fight scenes shot too tight on the participants, which creates for a kinetic energy but, to my taste, makes it difficult to determine what's actually happening. Fortunately, for me, this stopped in the later fight scenes. Also, and very unusually for the MCU films, the CGI is occasionally a little subpar, particularly in the climactic battle. <br/><br/>Though not breaking into my personal top five films of the MCU, there is much to enjoy with the characters and plenty of story scope for Black Panther 2."

"bryantjlarsen","1","12","23","11 May 2018"," Overhyped garbage
","This is no different from any marvel movie. The problem is that the characters are weaker and I think the main character is an ineffective xenophobe who worries too much about himself and what his father would have thought of him. The extras were distractingly goofy, and supporting characters were thin and more moral than BP himself. The humor attempts were scatted and lame. The beginning glossed over the origins way too quickly to understand and some of the mysticism around vibranium could have been better explained. Some of their actions didnt make much sense and the screenplay and special effects were a little lacking. I also thought that, for a marvel action movie, their could have been more ACTION. Go see it if you want a forgettable marvel action flick. SJWs wanted a black superhero (hes not the first one though, not even close) and they got it but just like star wars it is terrible. It focuses too much on ""blackness"" and all things sub-Saharan African. Can you imagine if Thor had scenes where he they have futuristic magic Sauna's and ride around in a Viking long ship spacecraft and everyone drank mead?"
"Aaron1375","8","12","23","8 April 2018"," Another Marvel hit
","I did not think I would enjoy this film as much as I did from the trailers I saw of the film, but it ended up surprising me. This movie gives us more insight into the world of the hero, the Black Panther, first introduced into the Marvel movie universe in the third Captain America movie. The film is rather lengthy as we traverse a lot of ground in this one as the film features two villains. While the film is good, it also really does nothing to lead up to the Infinity War film coming up later this month. Then again, very few Marvel films have really done much lead in to it other than the first Guardians of the Galaxy film and the introduction of a few infinity stones here and there. Mainly, in films like this, the only we get is an introduction to a new Marvel character on the big screen.<br/><br/>The story has the Black Panther taking on the role of king in his country after a ceremony where he can be challenged by others in his country of Wakanda. His first course of action is to take on a man who has been smuggling vibranium and selling it to the rest of the world. Vibranium is the strongest metal in the world! Well, it is in the Marvel cinematic universe, but it is actually admantium in the comics. Vibranium is a metal in the comics that is unstable and has to be interwoven in other metals to be effective, otherwise it is just a dangerous and highly volatile liquid metal that can cause great amounts of damage if left unchecked. When combined with admantium it then becomes nearly indestructible as this is what the Cap's shield is actually made of, not just vibranium. Um, kind of went on a nerd rant there. Well, they track this villain to a place in Asia, but soon another villain appears, calling himself, Killmonger. He is also of Wakadian descent and soon makes a bid for the throne himself. Soon a power struggle takes a place with the winner being head of the country with the largest vibranium deposits in the world! <br/><br/>I liked the character of the Black Panther and I enjoyed seeing inside his world which is very ritualistic and at the same time futuristic! There was more humor in the film than I was expected and I thought the Black Panther's sister was so cute and funny. The villains were both good in this one too, as we had one that had a super weapon within his hand and Killmonger seemed such a unstable villain as he looks so reserved and then goes insane at times. <br/><br/>The film was better than I was expecting as the trailers did not do the film justice. The film had very good action and some nice humor to fill in the spots between the action. I enjoyed the scenery in this one and the look into the fictional country of Wakanda. If another Black Panther film comes out, I look forward to seeing it as well."
"dancutline","5","12","23","20 February 2018"," Meh! It's pretty average.
","With such a strong cast and awesome characters I was really hoping for a lot more from this movie.<br/><br/>It felt to me as though the director / writers spent most of their time researching Africa and trying to bring in as many cultural references (which they did well) as possible and forgot to write some compelling dialogue, or give us an interesting story. I would have been happy with them dialling back the action / CGI battles if they had replaced it with a gripping story and some strong character development, but what we got instead was neither.<br/><br/>I'm probably being a little harsh, but after all the hype and incredible reviews it received, plus Black Panther's fantastic entry into the MCU in Civil War, I was left feeling sorely disappointed. Hopefully I'll enjoy it more on second viewing."

"SnoopyStyle","8","21","45","4 May 2018"," another solid hit
","To the outside world, Wakanda is a poor, isolated, reclusive kingdom in the center of Africa. In reality, it is a technologically advanced nation of five tribes through its use of vibranium from a crashed meteor. T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns home to take over the throne after the death of his father in Civil War. He is after arms dealer Ulysses ""Klaw"" Klaue who had previously stolen vibranium and caused mass Wakandan deaths. Klaw is working with Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) who seems to have intimate knowledge of Wakanda. In 1992 Oakland, the former king killed his brother who assisted Klaw during the heist.<br/><br/>Arguably, the MCU is the top box office franchise of today and it's nice for them to spread their influences into other niches of cinema. This is tackling some cultural aspects within the MCU superhero structure. All that is admirable but the question remains whether this is any good. The answer is that it's plenty good. First, Boseman is exceptional and projects a regal personality. The villains are great although I don't see the need of Killmonger working for Klaw. He should be killing him at first sight. There are a few things that concern me. The final battle feels obligational due to the superhero structure. The other great aspect is the women of Wakanda. They are all great. I also like the humor sprinkled among the action. It's not jokey but actually funny. The MCU is hitting on all cylinders and this is another solid hit."

3. Reveal the good guy part of the story

Maybe teenagers are the target audience, or adults gripping to childhood.<br/><br/>This among other Marvel and DC releases was as I suspected it would be; An over-animated mess without much sense other than to showboat over-priced CGI, over-done sound effects and over-compensated actors. The only decent aspect in all of this was the incredible wide angle scenic shots that could only look better if I were not to be in a cinema, but in nature properly being in these landscapes myself.<br/><br/>There are some neat ideas in the film, but if they're only made tangible by the before-mentioned budget, then this indicates a lack of imagination in viewers since a lot of these ideas like magnetic railways could be made far more common place if only we put our money to better use rather than it going to an over-inflated box office for people to sit in a cinema grazing on fat, salt and sugar to take their mind away from the job and bills they hate so much.

(This movie let you see a Marvel villain that had fleshed-out, noble motivations and showed how the ends do not always justify the means.)

","Hard to really pick a rating for this Marvel entry. All the clamor about one of the best Marvel films fails to meet objective standards. But money talks, very loudly! BP had a production budget of $200M and a marketing budget of $150M. It's like spending a few million for a Formula One racing car but getting a midsize Toyota. Not to say it's a bad film, but it could be so much better on so many fronts. I can understand Oscar nominations for special effects, visual effects and makeup/costumes. All deserved. Maybe even cinematography.<br/><br/>But consider several things: acting is very average, script is a bit on the weak side, directing is average. It's a very expensivemaybe abive average superhero flick. But money speaks and you can market a film. If you show it in every theatre and bring it to attention of Academy members, you win. For example, think about the success of McDonald's: mediocre food but outstanding marketing and presence. So everyone wants a below average burger. In today's world, sometimes we fail to think for ourselves.<br/><br/>The cultural impact on black America is immense, but that doesn't mean it's outstanding. It's interesting as it creates a whole new world in Wakanda. Which is why some critics rate it highly. Much like Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, it follows a spectacular imagination. And think of some films that did that and failed overall: The Last Airbender, has been the worst. But that's comparison with LOTR ends. The acting, script and directing in LOTR series was much better. I rate BP only a 4 but I could give it a 5, 6 or maybe a 6.5 at its highest. But given all the overly optimistic voting, I'm downgrading it.<br/><br/>BP' cast led by Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa and Michael Jordan as Erik really wasn't strong except the female roles of Lupita Nyong'o, Letitia Wright, and Danai Gurira were stronger, despite average scripts. It's solid entertainment but not Marvel's best. By comparison of superhero films of the same period, compare Wonder Woman. It's superior in many ways except David Thewlis as Morgan/Ares or the supervillain. You gotta be kidding, right? Somewhat not convincing. Patty Jenkins did a better job at directing than Ryan Coogler. But who's paying attention?"

By the way, my theater was ethnically mixed, and we laughed all the way thru the film. If you are only going to ""hate watch it"" then don't go. Save your money. <br/><br/>As for the political agenda- the only one I see is situating an Brown Skinned Superhero at the center of a superhero story. One who comes from privilege and not poverty. Offering little children of color to see themselves reflected on screen in a positive and empowering light. Giving them the idea there is a place for them in the super hero catalog. If that is a radical political message you don't support- that says way more about you than the film. And what it says isn't good."

","I just signed in to review this movie. it was boring, and really subpar. in no way it is comparable to the recent Marvel releases. to the like of Ragnarok, or Gog2. where these two gorgeous visual effect add in the storytelling and give a vibe to the movie. Black panther s' tho it is beautiful, serves merely as a postcard. to be contemplated, and the visual effect and the costume are the best part of the movie. <br/><br/>the storyline is as cliche as it comes and the characters are one-dimensional. it is great to have a black Marvel movie, but why can it not be something beyond cliche? tribe? street violence? ritual combat for succession? where are the plots and twists? characters development? <br/><br/>as for the political debate, same same. no development, either or<br/><br/>either Wakanda to be seen and save the black folks, or continue to lie for self-preservation. come on. what about proxy wars, proxy aids? or help an African nation to become prosperous, or create a new like Israel where the black folks wishing to seek refuge be reunited. <br/><br/>if the Wakanda king cannot see beyond this, his ancestors were right, better to lie for self-preservation. very poor movie. but with this box office, there would properly be a black panther 2. i wish they care to deliver a worthy black movie, so not to tarnish the genre."

","After the genius 3rd Thor movie I expected a lot more. I took a friend of mine with me that doesn't know the MCU and he was bored. A lot. Very foreseeable plot, sloppy CGI and the worst of all, close to no action.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie has been done before, to be honest, it looks like a recycled Thor movie: The legacy of the father that has made mistakes, a relative on the wrong side. My friend foretold nearly every ""plot twist"" 5 minutes before they happened. The problem is that the movie has a lot of interesting concepts, but they just get left behind. An intersting city? 5 minutes of screentime. Witty jokes? Like 3 in the whole movie, and the funniest character gets killed after like 40 minutes. Over the top action with intersting camera settings? 5% of the movie. The movie looks really nice, you want to see more of it. But instead you get discussions about Wakandan politics and the questionable choices of the main character's father.<br/><br/>The movie is also really hypocritcial. First one of the main characters complains about guns being babaric, 20 minutes later a lunatic is able to get crowned because he killed the good king in a ritual fight. Soldiers are on the side of the new king? **** it, let them kill their friends because they disagree with one another. The movie has a lot of promise, some scenes look promising, but that's it, they *look* promising, nothing more. <br/><br/>It's sad when the most insteresting about the film takes only 10% of the movie, the rest is really lackluster, especially the plot and the character development. It's really overhyped by SJWs. It's not a bad film, but it definetly doesn't deserve it's praise, or its place in the MCU."

The whole cast of colorful and skilled characters really make the story pop as there are elements of love, loss, drama, action, and comedy all throughout the film.

","Problems arise from every aspect of film making. Character wise the two villains and Shuri were the strongest, yet as expected of a mcu movie they kill off the villains and Shuri is pushed towards annoying at the turn of the film, showcased with the outdated 'what are those' scene. Sadly this was probably the worst Martin Freeman character I have seen personally. The movie does attempt to do something new but then always pulls the rug away and reverts back to the standard formula continuously. The accents in the movie fluctuated madly which really took me out of it, funnily enough of the one to get it wrong Freemans accent was by far the most changing. The tech in the movie is misconstrued, somehow while Klaws arm can defeat BPs suit Shuri's most improved power ranger arms do little to KIllmonger at all. The cgi is also an area for concern and the movie couldve prospered more from a real life shot. Of course Marvel ruined strong scenes by adding one-liners to the end which really made many of the so called leaders and professionals of the film come off in a very childish manner unbecoming of their positions (free pass to Shuri as she of course was a child). Killmongers plan which probably sounded good at a first pitch really falls apart once you consider anything remotely about it, be it the fact that Wakanda only has 4 planes to transport the weapons and said planes take a silly amount of time to reach the outer limits which is just lazy writing in terms of timing.
Onto the good stuff,the easiest thing to state is the cultural representation which is showcased continuously throughout the movie. The two villains are both very good, of course Klaw taking the first half, and Killmonger taking the latter (of course this being easier with the other no longer around haha, which was needed since Klaw was a stronger character but didnt have the philosophical reasoning to fight like Killmonger). Lastly the basis of the philosophy of the film works wonders and carries it even though the philosophy never really improves upon the basis in any meaningful way."

I must say the final scene where Kill-monger stats talking about slavery was in my eyes over dramatised and over looked today's problems. I also thought that the fight scenes were underwhelming considering that it's black panther. I was also really lost in when they started calling Kill-monger kill-monger as apposed to his characters name (which I can't remember), it didn't make sense to me and it was very forced, I feel they would have benefited more if there was no alias name. <br/><br/>Unfortunately when I left the cinema I had a sour taste in my mouth, not because it was a bad movie but because it didn't live up to the huge hype surrounding it's release."

"docsteel","6","11","21","19 February 2018"," The good, the bad.... and the ugly
","As a marvel fan who began reading comics in the early 1970's, Black Panther was a name I had known for decades but even at this high point was a minor character, but like Captain America, whom I had little interest in, my interest in both characters changed following the movies. With that reason and T'Challa's presence in Civil War, I had very high hopes for this movie... <br/><br/>The good: the cast is charismatic and works well together in most cases, even Boseman's delivery as he grapples with his move to king works well. The near break-out character is his sister, who is easily the most animated and gets the best lines in the movie. Vistas of Africa and inside the Wakanda capital are impressive and great eye-candy for a time. A thematic plea that we are all more alike than different and should be better people is present which frankly we all need more, which brings the films worst failing - more on that later. <br/><br/>The bad: actors clearly were locked into roles without much input, the feel in most cases was very wooden at times, even Boseman which is a shame as his extra dimensions in Civil War helped put it over the top. The set designs are good, but the CGI is rough by current standards, and in typical Marvel budget much of the fighting is at night, to reduce costs, a real shame as Black Panther looked awesome in full daylight combat in Civil War. The story as many have noted is just rote... but hey, it IS a Marvel movie so...<br/><br/>The ugly: for a film that purports to make a statement about moving to one human tribe, it is unconscionable that the two main white characters are portrayed as either evil post-colonial opportunists, or at best a stumbling federal agent who is so out of touch despite his connections to the events of Civil War that he is just dumbstruck and unable to comprehend quickly the state of Wakanda. Two light anti-white racial pejoratives were thrown around, which undermines the movies message of moving forward and not grouping people and making assumptions or unfair associations. <br/><br/>At its simplest, Black Panther is a very routine Marvel origin movie, overlayed with a well thought out sociological black diaspora politic analysis it all with a nod towards greater unity and an ascendant Africa, which makes its willingness to allow and in effect condone anti-white stereotyping all the more annoying. See it for the overall message, and be willing to realize that like society in general, it's not quite as advanced as it thinks it is."

Sadly I was disappointed as this an average flick. <br/><br/>Storywise, there is nothing much. It starts well, entertaining and made me curious. But sadly after 30 min or so, it turned into a below average film. No consistency in characters. W'Kabi turns negative all of sudden and surrenders in the end all of sudden? Ulysses Klaue character was well setup, but ends suddenly!. The story, scenes are pretty much loopy, predictable and long, poor dialogues (like - are you ok?, yes i'm ok). So many scenes are redundant, two long challenge scenes with same pattern and same dialogues and length, long drinking the potions scenes, three times getting buried and visiting ancestor - could have trimmed these repeating scenes, but it could cost the movie length badly i suppose as there is nothing else to show. Couple of good action scenes, though climax is a war sadly nothing worth mentioning.<br/><br/>Good performances from all of them. King's sister was brilliant and funny. The girlfriend and general did their part brilliantly. Andy Serkis was good but nothing much to it in the story, Michael B. Jordan was menacing, but not doing much after that. Chadwick Boseman physically he looks like a kid in the challenge scenes (maybe he is nothing without black panther potion!).<br/><br/>Overall good CGI and performance, but because its poorly written it fails to engage.

i admit that this movie is a good addition action flick to another marvel films that ever created until now, but i'm just expecting something more as a marvel fan, cause of the trailer that they always drop before the movie.
There are some weaknesses, such as a rather slow start, and some battle scenes that are somewhat forced timings .
there is a scene where t'challa is inaugurated as king and a black panther that should have an extraordinary scene but it looks rather dull and boring like nothing just happened.
nevertheless, the movie has some great moments and cool scenes even if it does not make an impression on my memory.
by the way, andy serkis gives a great performance here, he deserves more attention and I respect him<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you're a marvel lover, you might like this because infinity war is coming and everyone is waiting for it, and this movie is just a great addition to the other marvel action flick.

He did this by crafting his Black Panther script along with co-writer Joe Robert Cole to appeal to the masses of ordinary African-Americans who don't belong to an exclusive club of rich people that Coogler has recently joined.<br/><br/> 
Coogler accomplishes his appeal to the base first by embracing the idealistic, utopian vision of Africa in the form of the nation of Wakanda, a Marvel comics invention, that harks back to films from the 30s such as Lost Horizon, where a ""mysterious, harmonious valley"", dubbed ""Shangri-la,"" thrives, somehow protected merely by mountains and a large number of overarching clouds.<br/><br/> 
The whole idea is to present a positive image of African culture (mainly for) African-American youth in light of a history of put-downs which began of course during slavery times, when horrible stereotyped images of black people were first introduced and subsequently proliferated. Unfortunately, the tendency now is to go to the other extreme, so the blacks of Coogler's Wakanda are all powerful due to possession of the magical Vibranium, the super metal that gives them the technology to not only compete with the former (white) colonial powers of the world, but to surpass them!<br/><br/> 
The ascendancy of black power as depicted here is nothing more than wish fulfillment, and clashes with the true political history of Africa since each country achieved independence and threw off the yoke of their colonial masters after World War II. Coogler knows that the phony Wakanda is much more appealing with its lack of corruption and suggestion of complete female empowerment (he also throws in some completely out of place Star Wars-like spaceships just to prove he's as good as any established sci-fi director). <br/><br/> 
By playing to the base, Coogler refuses to present a ""warts and all"" portrait of the African homeland and reinforces what amounts to chauvinism (excessive or prejudiced loyalty or support for one's own cause, group, or gender). Although Coogler holds up the tribal infighting in Wakanda as some kind of cause célèbre, it's really an unconscious admission that African history is not so wonderful. As Patrick Gathara writes in the Washington Post, Africa is represented here ""as being divided and tribalized, with Wakanda run by a wealthy and feuding elite, centered upon ""royalty and warriors"", whose fortune comes not from its citizens' skill or ingenuity, but from a ""lucky meteor strike.""<br/><br/> 
Coogler's other strategy to win over the masses is to introduce a vengeful antagonist, Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan, the former protagonist star of Coogler's prior effort, Creed. Here, Jordan is much more effective playing the bad guy, since Coogler's protagonists apparently all tend to be rather bland (that includes the star of this film, Chadwick Boseman, who plays King T'Challah and the Black Panther (all rolled into one).<br/><br/> 
We first meet Killmonger in a flashback when he's just a kid in 1992 Oakland, California. This is where his father is killed by T'Challah's dad after he's discovered working with the racist South African Ulysses Klaue, who is attempting to steal Vibranium from Wakanda. Killmonger holds a grudge into adulthood and is determined to seek revenge against his uncle and cousin (as well as all whites).<br/><br/> 
Some may say that by Coogler using the name ""Killmonger"" (an obvious pejorative appellation), this suggests that he disapproves of the character's militant position. But think again. T'Challah doesn't finish Killmonger off at film's end-quite the contrary, he offers to save his life, if he only submits to eventual imprisonment. Killmonger instead takes his own life-Coogler views Killmonger's death as clearly tragic and obviously has sympathy for him.<br/><br/>
By evoking some measure of sympathy for the villain, Coogler sets another bad example for impressionable youth, suggesting that Killmonger's position has merit. And what exactly is Killmonger's position? He seeks revenge (as well as hegemony over) all whites associated with the excesses of colonialism in an African past. This of course ignores the fact that the almost all of the nations of Africa have been independent for at least 50 years and are responsible for their own shortcomings which of course include (first and foremost), rampant corruption (not to mention subjugation of women and other human rights violations).<br/><br/>
The strategy is of course to find a familiar scapegoat and deflect any calls for self-responsibility. Some may argue that Coogler is actually conflicted about this issue of revenge, especially because he depicts T'Challah as being conciliatory toward whites and seemingly rejects violence at film's end. But in actuality, Coogler's embrace of a Martin Luther King Jr. hero is merely done as a matter of expediency-he must suck up to the powers that be so they allow him into the exclusive film fraternity which he craves to be part of. In a sense, T'Challah's actions are almost a footnote-down deep, Coogler's real sympathies remain with the masses of deluded militants-with their puerile (and self-destructive) call for vengeance.<br/><br/>
When one looks closely at Coogler, one sees a very technically capable director who will remain a mediocrity as long as he continues to suck up to the mass of deluded chauvinists who embrace vengeance as a means of solving the sorry legacy of slavery and racism in the United States today."

","I don't even know if this should be classified as a movie. After living overseas and experiencing the African culture for myself I can tell you that this is the most indirect representation of the African culture that could exist.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with ridiculous scenes created by African AMERICANS whom don't even have a clue what their culture is like. It's not about wearing the African traditional outfits equipped with your multi million dollar diamond studs and dancing on cliff sides like some sort of animals who live in caves.<br/><br/>The black panther is a great addition to the comic series of any sort. But this movie butchers the minds of so many.<br/><br/>I'm literally lost trying to explain myself as to how STUPID this movie is. The ratings are obviously not real as if this movie got an 8/10.

","I was very excited when this movie was announced. The ratings were over the top, so I had higher expectations than I usually have.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I was very disappointed. I hate to say it, because I am a very fond Marvel fan and I've seen every Marvel movie over a dozen times, but this one will not be one of those. I am also glad I didn't have to pay for it, because I was invited. That says a lot.<br/><br/>The plot was dull. I didn't get what Killmonger wanted to achieve and why. First it looked like revenge because his father was killed by T'Chaka, then it was disappointment that Wakanda kept all the power for itself and didn't help others - outside Wakanda - to fight oppression. He wasn't very impressive as villain as well. Maybe he should have had more screen time?<br/><br/>In Civil War Chadwick Boseman excelled as king and BP but in this movie he wasn't very convincing as weren't the other actors.<br/><br/>I thought to see more of the African and Wakanda's culture and high-tech. There was only Shuri who was outstanding but wasn't portrayed very well either. All was done so fast, nobody has been shown more than a few snippets at a time. It was a come and go of characters but there was no conviction, no suspense.<br/><br/>I'm sad that the first Marvel movie that was made with nearly all black people, was so poorly made.

","This movie might deserve more than a 4 (probably not) but I'm harsh because of the 7.8 it clearly doesn't deserve.<br/><br/>The movie was a bland origin hero story. It had so much more potential, they decided to play it safe. <br/><br/>Acting and cast: I thought the cast was pretty interesting! I do like the king, his ""evil"" cousin and some other people (that guy who played in black mirror, bike episode), they seem to have potential and charisma. Buuuut they had horrible lines and flat one sided roles. A good thing this movie did is open our eyes on some actors that will rise in the future. But probably not in a Black panther 2, marvel isn't good at that (Iron man 2 ewwww... Thor 2 yurk...)<br/><br/>CGI and effects: well, there goes your expectations. Since Iron man 1, I've always been shocked by how realistic the CGI looks. Even in the avengers, Iron man and his buddy look so real and physically present. In this movie, it's gone. The CGI is on a DC movie level (I love DC but their CGI.... urrr). Every shot smells green screen, every fight and flying ship scene looks like a game cinematic. Very bad. 
Again, so much potential from African landscapes... wasted behind an obvious green screen for 2h straight.<br/><br/>Music... is forgettable. I remember the first time I heard the avenger's theme. Well, I will never remember the soundtrack of this movie. <br/><br/>Plot and dialogues. Zero surprises. Good guy, bad guy, bad guy kicks good guy's ass, good guy get his powers back and win the second fight.. the end. <br/><br/>Clearly the movie was over hyped by the black cast thing. The movie is, literally just Thor, but black. Don't believe me? Okay, hear this: the prince of a hidden kingdom has to prove he is worthy of his superpowers in order to become king and has to fight his evil sibling. Black Panther or Thor?"

Too much has been made of it by SJW's claiming that if your white you inherently will give this film a bad review, people accusing me of being racist if I don't like a crap film will not force me to like it. As I have stated I like a wide variety of films starring black actors as a matter of fact lots of my favorite actors are black I could go on about Jamie Foxx's performance as Django as he was simply superb however this review is about this ""movie"" which was not superb in anyway. Everything about it was bland, generic and design to appeal to people who would rather make it a big political issue and start more animosity with white people, personally I think these politics should be kept out of it because a film should be about whether it entertains or not, back to Blade again where this film is just about the politics of you must like this or your racist this never happened with Blade he was universally loved by both Black and White people in effect this has undone a lot of the hard work films such as Blade did by ramming politics down your throat and has in effect been nothing but a racist film towards non blacks. In defense of the people actually involved with this film I am giving them the benefit of the doubt that this was not there intention and that all the crap with the SJW's comes from there inability to actually engage what little intelligence they have, I would also state that the Black community have also been forced into the middle of this by the SJW's because most Black people don't want to force being black as being and issue it's usually white middle class morons chucking tantrums as they obviously did not get enough cuddles when they were children.

I am not worrying people from China, Russia, or other Communist/Buddhist/Christianity majority countries. I am worrying countries like Myanmar, Indonesia, Philippines, Hong Kong, Lebanon, where the muslims population is quiet high while they always dream supremacy but in fact they socially and economically mostly lower than non muslims.

","There is a lot to say about the direction this movie took but simply put the hype behind them film is just that. The main issues with the film in my opinion are the below<br/><br/>From the very beginning the extremely simple core plot line is obvious. Good guy becomes king, evil family member dethrones him and in the end good guy reclaims the throne. It's literally a story we've seen hundreds of times before. Add to that a run time that could have been 30mins shorter and you have a mildly boring film <br/><br/>While introducing us to Wakanda and the culture we are told how much tradition and fellowship are what made Wakanda as great a nation as it is. However, towards the end of the film that idea is tossed to the side for plot development. There is a very specific scene where it is stated by Wakandan laws the bad guy should not be king yet all the Wakandans chose to ignore their tradition in favor of the bad guy anyways (ummmm what?). <br/><br/>Then you have the issue of race, politics and possibly the worst villain in a marvel movie. Honestly looking at the film in it's completion there is no way anyone should logically agree with Kilmonger in any way. Without giving away spoilers let's just say all his talk of oppression, slavery and being held back due to race has nothing to do with the story we are given. In reality there is only one set of people he should want revenge on but he's simply not smart enough to realize it. In honesty you could remove all the politics/race from this movie and it would not alter it in any way. It seems like Marvel simply added a few lines here and there to appeal to the target demograhic which in this case was under 30 black males.<br/><br/>While this film as a stand alone movie was good it simply doesn't live up to what Marvel has built. I simply do not care what happens with Wakanda or if a sequel is made and that's upsetting. Maybe when a sequel is made (you know there will be) Marvel will cut all the politics and give the fans an action packed thrill ride instead of 2+ hours of mind numbing interactions that really mean nothing as a whole"

I have gone online and read multiple reviews about how it's one of the best of the 18 MCU movies to date and for me, it's not even in my Top 5. I've been trying to figure out why it didn't do it for me, and I'm not sure maybe it's because it comes right after Thor Ragnarok (best MCU movie so far), or it comes before Infinity War (we've all seen the trailer, like give it to us already!) I feel the first 30 minutes or so was a drag, albeit the cinematography and costumes were astounding (google the Filipino influence on the female warriors' costume), but was necessary in order to setup the movie but I didn't get reeled in until maybe Laetitia Wright as Shuri, the black princess (Disney's 2nd, progress!) that can give Tony Stark a run for his money (literally and figuratively) showed up and somewhat stole the show. Danai Gurira imposed herself very well as Okoye, Black Panther's General and leader of the fierce all-female badass army Dora Milaje. Lupita Nyong'o held her own as the requisite ""damsel in distress"", Daniel Kaluuya as BP's right hand man (hated him but still love him) and last but not the least, Michael B. Jordan who I'm thankful they rescued from the dreaded Fantastic Four reboot as one of the movie's antagonist. You know who I'm not raving about? Chadwick Boseman. He seemed okay in Civil War and I don't know if he had to stay stiff because he was royalty but he was boring as a brick. As in don-the-suit-already-and-scratch-my-eye kind of boring. I was actually thinking Chiwetel Ejiofor would've been a better choice but he's already come up as Mordo in Dr. Strange. Storyline was interesting and current, fight scenes were worth the wait, the ending could've been better but is good enough.<br/><br/>So to recap, good movie, great visuals, impressive supporting cast, exhilarating fight scenes and we want a Shuri, Tony Stark face off.<br/><br/>Favorite quote: We must find a way to look after each other, as if we were one single tribe."

","I'm fully aware of what type the Marvel movies are. I've seen them all and I can appreciate how the studio chose to present its stories and characters. Nothing too ambitious nor too stupid. Well design entertainment. Black Panther however is not like that.<br/><br/>Production value in Marvel movies is there to overshadow possible drawbacks. Panther is sloppy in the production and since there are many drawbacks this movie is simply put - boring. CGI is rather good but when it's bad - it's very bad. It looks like several director assistants put this movie together. Few did very good job - the rest not so much. The result makes me want to compare this movie with the last DC... That's how bad it is. <br/><br/>Story is yet another thing that made me scratch my head. This was pretty much a Marvel version of Amistad. Seems like yesterday, I know but why to put this theme in the movie? They wanted to compete for Oscars or something? Basically the story goes like this: Black folks are oppressed all around the world and there's secret, super advanced and resources-rich country in the middle of the poorest continent but they do nothing about the evil in the world. That's not even half of what is wrong with the story but you get the picture. <br/><br/>Acting is something you never look too closely in Marvel movies simply because there's not much time for it. Slow moments are rather few and are well positioned in the story and well directed. Not here. Main character apart from crying 10 times does little to symphonized with him. Black Panther and his friends are so dull and uninteresting that I much more liked two main villains and theirs motivations. Seriously. And dialogues? Only the bad guys made sense here. ""Good guys"" talk and talk nonsense for hours. Not to give you some perspective or background but to save money on CGI (I guess). <br/><br/>I pay no attention to details like music in Marvel movies. But here you cannot miss this. Soundtrack contains everything from typical rap, through typical African music to classical drama-like music. This would normally be good BUT. The way this music is implemented in the scenes would make you think ""wait, what?!?"". I rarely watch movie where soundtrack is making it worse not better. <br/><br/>The list of what's wrong goes on...<br/><br/>This is a bad movie, bad Marvel movie, and poor overall production."
"mounirrmaged","5","12","24","1 March 2018"," Another day, another marvel movie.
","Black panther's reception from the audience and critics seems to be more focused on the 'representation of black people"" than the actual movie. And before going deeper in the review, I want to respond to the ""black representation"" overhyping the movie. Since a lot of people praise the movie for positive portrayal of the black race, as if its the only AND first one to do so, have people forgot about previous movies that portray black heroism? Hidden figures, mandela, long way to freedom, shaka zulu, get on up, 42? How about south African art cinema to appreciate and know the real culture? Nope? Just a mediocre superhero movie? Do people want to stay away from the African culture and act like black panther is the real deal? It doesn't even reflect Africa except in the most superficial ways (costumes, traditions etc). Now I have nothing against African culture of course, but people should stop treating this as some sort of a savior for the black people. A super technologically advanced FICTIONAL African country won't help save anyone. Its just fantasy empowerment, nothing else. Now that I have rambled enough, It's time to talk about the movie itself: <br/><br/>The movie by no means is bad, but its not great as critics say imo. It lacks depth and interesting layers. It lacks emotional investment like let's say winter soldier, logan and iron man. I simply don't care about the story or the characters. They fall flat and one note that I become bored, save for few characters (Killmonger, Shuri) despite the cast doing the best they could. Chadewick Boseman, Michael B Jordan and the rest of the cast are all perfect choices and they do their best to make the characters engaging, but only Michael B Jordan succeeds the most out of them. <br/><br/>The movie in the first act suffers from boring exposition and poor characterization, where it simply introduces these characters and the world of Wakanda but its not very interesting until the ritual and fighting begins. (Although Killmonger's backstory contains interesting points. Speaking of killmonger, he is easily the best character in the movie. He is interesting, you sympathize with his ideals even though his methods are questionable. He's a great villain who is a good challenge to the king <br/><br/>The cinematography and CGI in this movie can sometimes be good, but other times it can be horrible. The best bits of it are in the hand to hand combat on the mountains, the ritual scenes etc. Other times it feels bad like the car chase scene where it lacks levity, creativity and erotic actions sequences. It becomes even worse in the third act, with the rhinos, and the train fight scene, which yes is as bad as people say. In fact, it looks straight out of a ps2 video game. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie is not bad, but its also not great. Would I recommend it? Mostly to the MCU fans and those who love black panther, but its not a great movie. It lacks depth and interesting drama."
"ccamp89","4","12","24","26 February 2018"," In a word: bland.
","Full disclosure: I'm not a fan of Marvel films. I haven't watched a film in this series since Guardians of the Galaxy, and my reactions to the few I've seen have generally ranged from indifference to hatred. If you consider yourself a fan, feel free to take my thoughts with a grain of salt or just ignore me completely.<br/><br/>With that being said, the best I can say about Black Panther is I didn't actively dislike it as much as I have some other Marvel films. I mostly just found it incredibly lifeless and boring. There is a pervasive feeling of blandness and inertia that plagues this film from beginning to end. Nearly the first full hour feels like an exercise in directionless wheel-spinning. On paper, it makes some sense to spend the first chunk of the film world-building and introducing us to the new environment and characters before the plot kicks in, and I guess the film attempts that? Kind of? But sadly, sweeping, panoramic, CGI vistas of the city don't really count as ""world-building"" in my book. And almost every scene in Wakanda that isn't a CGI flyover takes place on a small greenscreen-shrouded soundstage. It all has a sterile, artificial, and clinical feel and the culture of the city simply doesn't translate into something tangible.<br/><br/>The characters don't fare better. For all of the buzz about this being Marvel's ""character-driven"" film, what really surprised me the most was just how uninspired these characters were. The villain is the only one who rises slightly above the pack, but he's really only interesting in a relative sense given that every other character here is flat and generic. Andy Serkis as the side-kick villain was ok too I guess; he was one-note, sure, but at least he had a note. In a particularly eye-roll inducing scene, we see the ""elder"" Wakandan (Forest Whitaker's character) killed off by the villain in melodramatic fashion. Am I supposed to care? This ""character"" had literally no establishment, personality, or stake in the film whatsoever. He's the older dude with the long robe who's probably wise or something. He died now. Feel something.<br/><br/>At least the film had a message though, right? It was about something more than a good guy fighting a bad guy! In the most superficial of senses, yes. But the fact that this film is being seen as some sort of political statement heralded for its cultural insight is ridiculous. The ""substance"" of this film is essentially a sprinkling of heavy-handed dialogue which references topical issues like immigration and identity politics. It amounts to an illusion of depth to distract you from what is, at its core, another standard and vapid comic book film.<br/><br/>Strong 2/5"
"reckittspawn","3","12","24","20 February 2018"," It's Troy but in Africa instead of Greece
","Did you ever see that movie Troy from 2004? (or maybe 2003 or 2005. . sometime around then).
This movie is exactly the same. People fighting with killing to be the one in charge with a hot, sexy man walking around shirtless the whole time.
I don't even understand how this constitutes as a super hero movie, because he wasn't walking around saving people in distress from crime in the middle of the night or nothing.
Nothing really happens in the movie. It's a lot of mindless violence. People get killed for no reason. People kill people without thinking twice and with no remorse. A lot of people brought their little kids to see this movie of violent slayings
And sex god, Chadwick Boseman, is shirtless for most of the movie, which is why I bumped it up from 1 star to 3. Because I like myself some eye candy.
I should probably just stop seeing anything by Disney altogether, because I was born in the 1980s, and I don't think I ever seen anything Disney that wasn't a remake of something else, or based on old fairy tales, or comics that were already tv shows in the 1960s."
"tlurk","5","12","24","18 February 2018"," Teasers and Trailers did this one a disservice!
","Spoilers coming! I left the theater feeling underwhelmed. I'd felt this way after Spiderman, too; just wasn't enough tension or maybe it was over-hyped. The worst part is that the trailers for this movie revealed the best of the special effects and fights. As the movie went on, the coolest effects were already exposed and that took the wind right out of the sails. Then, couple that with ""Infinity Wars"" teasers that show T'Challa alive and well and interacting with Captain America, we already knew that he was coming out alive and still King of Wakanda. Plus, the later teaser reveals Bucky is hidden in Wakanda; we could easily and safely assume that wherever Cap is, he's not far from Bucky. <br/><br/>The politics took more of the steam from this film, too. It had the smell like the Anakin Trilogy from Star Wars (Eps 1, 2, & 3), where we are subjected to an imaginary C-SPAN. The slow downs didn't make the movie as exciting as previous MCU movies.<br/><br/>They didn't really tie this one into the MCU as well as others. I could have really enjoyed a couple Avenger cameos here. Plus, they had a prime opportunity to bring them in with the time line being right after ""Civil War"". <br/><br/>Now, all that said, I enjoyed the movie overall. I'd watch it over all the DC movies, save Wonder Woman. It was entertaining, the suspense just wasn't there. Maybe, I had built it up too much in my head. Ant-Man and Dr. Strange were two of my favorites not knowing anything about their characters and I hoped Black Panther would do the same. In the end, I was disappointed but it was still worth watching. Here's hoping the next one picks up the momentum of the franchise.<br/><br/>TL"
"muhammedelgammal_","5","12","24","17 February 2018"," One of Marvel's worst movies
","I was super excited for this movie. Considering it is the last movie before the Avengers: Infinity War movie, I had high expectations for it.<br/><br/>The story was all over the place. There was little presence of character development. The movie jumped into each of the characters as if we had already seen them all before in prequels.<br/><br/>Klaw, played by Andy Serkis, was back. He was briefly introduced to us in Avengers: Age of Ultron. Klaw was selling stolen vibranium to Ultron in the middle of the movie. It was established that he was the only survivor to ever break into Wakanda and steal their precious vibranium metal. Now the Black Panther movie started in 1992, where it showed the aftermath of someone who betrayed Wakanda by giving Klaw a way to get in to steal the vibranium. It was actually an extremely weak opening to the movie. Instead of showing Klaw breaking into Wakanda and stealing the vibranium, it only showed a 5-10 second video surveillance clip of the destruction. This opening scene set for a terrible movie. Marvel should have shown Klaw breaking into Wakanda to give us more development for his character.<br/><br/>The movie did not get interesting until towards the middle where the sale was going to be made for stolen vibranium. General Okoye, played by Danai Gurira, was absolutely awesome! She was by far the best character in the movie. Her dedication to the Wakanda throne was unparalleled. Okoye went crazy, in a good entertaining way, during the sale of the vibranium. I swear, I think she was fighting and beating up more people in this movie than Black Panther was!<br/><br/>Black Panther, played by Chadwick Boseman, was disappointing. I am not referring to his performance. I am speaking of his character development. We were first introduced to him in Captain America: Civil War. We received a glimpse of him as Black Panther and Prince T'Challa. In this movie, it continued directly after the Captain America: Civil War movie timeline. It did not show T'Challa as a child. It did not show him learning how to become the Black Panther. It did not show any of that. Come on Marvel, what were you thinking?<br/><br/>Black Panther's fighting scenes were annoying as well. The majority of his presence was at night. It made it difficult to see the detail of his ability and movement. There was really only one scene towards the end where his suit was not so blended in the dark, but it was quickly ended after the fight moved underground to the vibranium mining area.<br/><br/>Erik Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan, was a great villain. But once again, there was minimal character development. It showed him as a child for a few seconds, then it fast forwarded to the present day. All of the in-between were quickly talked about and forgotten.<br/><br/>Overall, I was not too pleased with this movie. Marvel could have done better with the opening scene and the character development. Now I am left questioning how good Avengers: Infinity War will be in May."
"johnny_blaze665","5","12","24","17 February 2018"," Mediocre at best
","Given the hype that surrounds this movie I wasn't surprised to see it's just a mediocre flic at best.
What's more shocking is the no bad review crusade, really? I'm glad I live in a country in which I'm not afraid to voice my opinion, be it bad or good.
This movies is loaded to the brim with every trope of the genre, up to the point it feels ridiculous.
If the movie would have steered away from this leftist and PC insanity, and tried to stay faithfull to the source material it would have made a good movie.
But what it does is that it tries to be all things and all people, while pleasing none.
As a final note to the delusional people, this isn't the first black superhero movie: Blade trilogy, Luke Cage, Nick Fury etc."
"damiant-34865","10","21","47","25 March 2018"," Great movie!!!

"arianna709","8","14","29","6 July 2018"," The low reviews are from people who don't want to admit that they're racist.
","This movie has a seriously stable racial undertone. That unfortunately a lot of people are unable to relate to. The critics gave this movie incredible reviews because of what not only was done cinematically but culturally as well. The acting is special and I believed to be heart felt. Considering this is a first of its kind I was pleased that it didn't feel like it would be the last of its kind. The music speaks to you and gives you a great feeling of pride. No matter where you come from. I battled with the decisions the characters were making and the challenges they were faced which is a great thing because the movie made you think on several different levels. I read someones review and he/she stated the story was ripped from The Lion King but yet they rated it a one. If that's the case are you mad because you felt it wasn't original or did you dislike The Lion King too(another movie involving African culture). Lol what a misguided childhood if you didn't like the The Lion King.
Is there a large use of CGI yes but name a movie even without action that doesn't. Marvel/Disney are giving us awesome affects. Appreciate it! This is a superhero movie! I completely wish people that are bias would stop seeing these movies eyes wide shut and live a little. Watch this movie think outside the box. It's now one of my favorites from the Marvrel Universe and they are not at all giving us bad movies especially not ones that you could possibly put the rating of a 1 or under a 6 for that matter. Ones,twos and threes are for B movies with terrible visual effects and absolutely no plot. Know the rating system so you don't give people the wrong ideas! 
Lets just be honest people drug this movie across the dirt more than any other Marvel superhero movie. Why is that?? Oh you know why! Totally didn't deserve it! Great movie that should, if you're morally correct work for everyone."

","That is the only thing that could come out of this film. It is not terrible like the new 'Star Wars' but it could have been much better. I am not into gender wars (Wonder Woman) and now race wars, but I have to say this film is just over-hyped and all about gadgets and technology. That in itself was disappointing because the setting is hard to believe and swallow.<br/><br/>This film also contributes to it, but is not at fault in and of itself, but I am growing tired of the constant barrage of Marvel characters Disney is releasing every week. Again, better than Star Wars and whatever has Scarlet Johansson squatting and doing flip flops in, but as a whole the character development is not there and so the character is swamped by technology.<br/><br/>Valerian last year was a much better film and because it didn't have Disney's hype machine behind did so poorly. Shows you race baiting and hype is winning."
"Jared_Andrews","10","24","55","27 April 2018"," As Spectacular as Advertised
","This movie is awesome. Let's get that out of the way first. It's not the best movie ever, as some claim. It's probably not even the greatest superhero movie ever made, but it is at least worthy of that conversation, which is saying a lot. <br/><br/> Black Panther ascended to levels of hype and promise that seemed nearly unreachable-and it reached them. It's virtually unprecedented for a movie to live up to these outlandish expectations, but that's exactly what it did. <br/><br/> So, what is this movie that climbed all the way into the top five all time at the U.S. box office? <br/><br/>Enter Wakanda, a fictitious African country posing as just another third-world nation, but it is secretly the technologically advanced nation in the world because it rests on a mountain on vibranium, the strongest metal in the MCU. Wakanda's king, T'Chaka, was recently killed in an attack, so his son T'Challa is set to assume the throne. T'Challa also fulfills the role of Black Panther, a cunning and powerful warrior featuring superhuman powers supplied by a Wakandian plant and stylish and functional suit made of vibranium. <br/><br/> Wakanda is fiercely loyal to its traditions and to its people. It opts to interact minimally with the outside world and lets in no outsiders, as to protect its secret wealth. This way of life is threatened by the resurfacing of buried stories from the past and the arrival of an outsider who believes Wakanda can no longer sit comfortably as billions in other countries across the globe suffer. T'Challa is forced to deal with the challenges of being a good man and a good king as he navigates the dilemma of staying true to Wakanda's rigid tradition or adapting to a more progressive philosophy. <br/><br/> Chadwick Boseman plays the role of T'Challa with exceptional poise, grace and an absolutely regal accent. He would have been the true standout of the movie if not for several other standout performances. 
Danai Gurira (Michonne of The Walking Dead) shines as General Okoye, the king's go-to warrior. Her love, W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya), though on screen less, plays just as significant a role, as he is one of the strongest voices pushing for change to Wakanda's international policy. And, of course, Kaluuya steals a few scenes with his remarkably expressive acting. <br/><br/> Additional shouts to Winston Duke for his role as an intimidating leader of a Wakandian tribe with a dark sense of humor, a low-key warmth, and a penchant for barking. And another one to Sterling K. Brown for playing T'Chaka's brother, a spy dispatched in Oakland who sees the struggles of people firsthand. <br/><br/>The greatest standout of the all the standouts is Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger. His intense presence fills the room in every scene he enters. He exudes such charisma with his American street manner of speaking and swagger that I almost found myself rooting for him, despite his violent and murderous tendencies. Even in his worst moments, he is always sure of his purpose and his message, which is a compelling one. This message, paired with his backstory, make him easy to empathize with.<br/><br/>Another thing: Killmonger is powerful and scary. He's more than a worthy adversary for Black Panther. At times he appears to the be Black Panther's better. Like Bane in Dark Knight Rises, an intelligent villain capable of physically overwhelming the hero, he feels like a real threat. We legitimately believe he can win. It comes as no surprise that his fight scenes with Black Panther will leave you breathless.<br/><br/> The action sequences deliver all the thrills you would expect from a Marvel movie and from a Ryan Coogler movie (he's now 3 for 3 in his directorial efforts). But the deeper social themes and inner conflicts of the key characters are what elevates this movie to elite status. Yes, seeing a movie with predominantly Black actors and a Black director is also important. It's important to viewers, young viewers most of all, and it's also important to movie studios. Hopefully Black Panther's booming success will finally dispel the myth that movies with Black lead actors don't do well in the box office.<br/><br/> Before I wrap up, I have to give credit to Andy Serkis for his rare non-CGI performance. The guy comes in and throws 100mph from the jump and manages to be hateable, funny, and fun throughout. And final shout outs to Angela Bassett, for playing the royal and majestic mother of T'Challa, and to Letitia Wright, for playing T'Challa's wisecracking tech genius little sister, Shuri. <br/><br/> Apologies to anyone I didn't spotlight. This movie is flooded with incredible performances, so I had to omit a couple mentions to keep this review to a reasonable word count. <br/><br/> Bottom line: go see Black Panther. If you already saw it, see it again. It's that good. It deserves all the praise, and I hope to see it next year at the Oscars."

","What needed work:
There are no accidents in the characters which the writers portrayed in this film. Once you see that each character in the film is illustrating a piece of the modern race conflict narrative, you can't unsee it, and for me---it soured the an otherwise great plot & movie. <br/><br/>Erik Killmonger's words near the end, ""Throw me into the ocean with my ancestors"" pointed to a lamentable world of self-pity that so many live in today, and demonstrated a great disrespect for the value of life. It made me sick to my stomach that the directors chose not to redeem his character in any substantial way in the denouement of the movie. <br/><br/>Take a moment and ask of the screenplay writers, ""What message are you trying to communicate through Erik's despair of life itself?"" Is the answer for the modern black male to simply ""give up""?? Isn't it rather to rise up, and above one's situation? So----why not allow Erik to work through the issues, and see past the history, and into a brighter future? <br/><br/>Lastly, racially charged terms were an unfortunate addition to a superhero movie. 
""Dumb farmers"" ""Colonizers"" ""Slaves"". Just don't go there. It added *nothing* to the movie for me to hear these demeaning terms.<br/><br/>What I liked:
Extremely high quality acting throughout... AMAZING choice of talent. <br/><br/>I love how the underlying values of Enlightenment, Community and working together came through very strong in the film. I loved how the final scene back in Oakland, California with the boys playing hoops ""bookended"" the opening scene nicely. <br/><br/>Great character development throughout.

","It's not as good as people are saying it is, it's a boring dull and uninspired Marvel movie that pales in comparison to the last three Marvel films which were for the most part decent fun films. Everything that made the last three Marvel films fun and entertaining are gone from this one. Black Panther tries to way more serious in tone taking on a more mature story and in the process fails miserably putting itself on an equal footing with films like Ant Man and the second Iron Man movie. It's not awful but chances are you won't be remembering this after a couple days.<br/><br/>Funny enough the plot for this film is an almost beat for beat carbon copy of Thor Ragnarok (extra points for originality!) which I liked, you've got the son of a great king finding out that his father ain't all that great of a guy, you've got the blood relative that comes to usurp the throne that is originally bestowed upon the main guy, the main guy meets daddy in Marvel hell and gains the mojo he needs to beat up the big baddy, main guy takes the aid of an army force and takes back the throne. The similarities even extend to the main guy teaming up with his likeable funny sibling that everyone loves. Now if these two films have so much in common then how come one of ems a steaming pile of mediocrity? Taika Waititi realized that Thor is a dumb character and that no one wants to see another Thor 1 or 2 and instead aimed for a lighthearted fun comedy action film that doesn't try to be anything that it isn't unlike BP. It's the banter and character interactions within Thor Ragnarok that elevate it above an average Marvel film, Waititi is aware that you can't create a serious Dark Knight esque film about a character like Thor without deviating from the generic Marvel formula and having it come out as a tonally inconsistent forgettable mess. BP is in essence, a dry bland boring version of TR that misses out on the interesting likeable characters and humor that made TR great.<br/><br/>Visuals were okay except for the CG which was laughable especially during fight scenes, speaking of fight scenes the choreography felt very lackluster. The pacing for the first half or so of the film felt very sluggish. The bloodless brutality was strange, I get that its PG-13 but I mean come on. Characters in this film were mostly forgettable despite most performances being solid. The best character in the film Andy Serkis is killed off early on to help further MBJ's plot. Some characters felt pointless Daniel Kaluuya's role felt like a cheap segway into Michael B Jordan's character Kilmonger. Another generic Marvel villain who I can't for the love of god understand why people care for. His garbled motivations and nonsensical plans were laughable and I couldn't take his name, backstory, or really anything seriously.<br/><br/>I don't want to sound like I hated this film, It's just extremely mediocre. The most I can speak of for positives is the films soundtrack and even then it isn't even implemented that well into the film, the soundtrack that was advertised all over the trailers is sorely underused and its a damn shame. That and the fusion of traditional African into the films score was nice. That's about it.<br/><br/>I give this 4 gas station beef patties /10"

","Too much hype killed this movie. I kept hearing this was Marvel's best movie to date... it isn't. Plain and simple. It was okay. But I wouldn't even put it up there in Marvel's Top 5 movies to date."
"kevinheroes0504","5","6","10","5 March 2018"," I wanted to like it, but it was honestly bad....
","First things first, the culture and music of Black Panther was fantastic. I was wowed with their great way of blending African culture to the modern technology with the signature building and the ""mask"" plane with were genius design and all. The place was well designed and the deep culture was very believable. Moreover, the moment when Killmonger set foot in Wakanda, the music also changed, signifying the intrusion of him by starting mixing hip hop to tribal rhythm. All the technology was awesome and the black cast was top notch. Every tribes seems to have their own signature technology too. Micheal B Jordan was awesome as a villain and the scene with Killmonger and his dad was gold. However, ....<br/><br/>In before the next part, I am sorry guys, I really wanted to like Black Panther, after so many good reviews and hype from you guys, but I just could not. I probably get tons of downvotes and salt for this too.<br/><br/>The plot is just weird, it seems alright but part of me feels like I'm watching a cut version without some further scene to explain the plot for me.<br/><br/>Some stuffs:<br/><br/><ul><li>Ok, King T'Chaka:</li></ul><br/><br/>The former BP was forced to kill his younger brother because of his radicalization. N'jobu, his brother, was informing Ulysses Klaue, a criminal, about Wakanda and told him where can he attacked to get the Vibranium.<br/><br/>After killing his brother, he then proceed to leave, without any checking the room for notes, documents or information about Wakanda or his brother's colleagues. Furthermore, he also left the body behind for the cops to find and expose his kingdom to the world. ?<br/><br/><ul><li>The museum heist:</li></ul><br/><br/>Wow, a stealth heist, with great beginning, surprise, poisoning, hostages.... BANG. Everyone dies!!!<br/><br/>What? So why don't you storm in there, steal the Vibranium, then leave on an ambulance, seems still okay to me. Why planned a heist like that ended up in a robbery.<br/><br/><ul><li>The Korean casino.</li></ul><br/><br/>So the US wanted the most valuable metal in the world, Vibranium, and they had to buy it from a shady criminal, what should they do? Oh, send 1 single man to buy it, without guards, without planning, without extract points, in a fishy casino is SK.<br/><br/><ul><li>After the casino:</li></ul><br/><br/>It seems that Klaue miraculously survived a horrible accident with barely any injury. Cool, now let's capture him and hold him in the least secured room in the police station with nothing behind the wall and hope that he does not brings any friend with him that may rescue him. So it seems all Wakandans were just extra careless when it comes to putting Klaue behind bars.<br/><br/>Killmonger, aka Erik, aka N'Jadaka, who was N'jobu's son was a highly trained professional soldier, an undercover agent, a war veteran who was perfect in every way.<br/><br/>Is this not another Mary Sue/Marty Stu thing?<br/><br/>An important character with a tragic past now excel in every aspect in his life, overcome great odd and carry a mission for redemption of his past and takes vengeance to those who wronged him?<br/><br/>I have not lived in US yet, but it seems to me, a son of a criminal, now dead, with mom seems to be not in the picture much, can advance so much while hundred thousand of others kids with same fate ended up worse.<br/><br/>I am not saying he has no opportunity to do these things, it was just so convenient and easy to set him up like that to make him a badass villan and not very realistic too.<br/><br/><ul><li>Erik, killing Klaue:</li></ul><br/><br/>So Erik killed Klaue to earn some credit from the Wakandan, right? So why he had to struck a deal with Klaue before, seems to be no reason at all. He could just meet Klaue, kill him, come back to Wakanda, and earn some trust.<br/><br/><ul><li>The weird loyalty of Wakandan:</li></ul><br/><br/>"" We will serve whoever sit in that throne, no matter how evil, foolish, dickhead they are"". That is what I see in the political situation in Wakanda. Seriously, it is a miracle that this country has not ended up killing each other in civil war or destroyed themselves with Vibranium.<br/><br/><ul><li>The Heart Shape plant:</li></ul><br/><br/>So this plant gives people super power physically exceeding normal human. Cool. And let's not grow it any where else except this tiny room. In addition, when Killmonger was there, he just seems to be alright with burning the whole things down without thinking about consuming more to be stronger or giving his people this plant so they can rise up themselves.<br/><br/><ul><li>The society:</li></ul><br/><br/>Who get chosen to be outside herding sheep and who will have the right to stay in the technological advanced city. It is just unfair for people outside.<br/><br/><ul><li>W'kabi:</li></ul><br/><br/>Saying he is super loyal to the king 5 mins before he betrayed everything he knows including his long time friend and his lover with a strange dude who was born outside and also conveniently killed his nemesis. Hmmmm<br/><br/><ul><li>Shuri:</li></ul><br/><br/>The whole kingdom's technology innovation lays in the hands of a 16 years old girl without any other older person/scientist in sight. Hmmm<br/><br/><ul><li>T'Challa to Killmonger after the big fight:</li></ul><br/><br/>""I know you tried to kill me, my mom, my sisters (for fun), my friends, turned the country up side down, probably also plotted to overthrow world's governments, ignite social turmoil, and take over other's nations. But I will let you live.""<br/><br/>To me, this moment, every character development, conflicts, ideology clash were rendered meaningless. The king did not learn.<br/><br/><ul><li>T'Challa to the world:</li></ul><br/><br/>Yes, Wakanda will open to the world, but please also notice that this nation's government is a totalitarian monarchy which leaders elected by a Mak'Gora or a fighting ritual where one can be beaten to dead. We are not barbarian at all.<br/><br/>And also some other things:<br/><br/>Most of the fight was in night time, and the characters were mostly black or in black suit. It just hard to concentrate on the fight. Shaky cams were horrible too.<br/><br/>A private plane flies from South Korea to Central Africa? Nice<br/><br/>Shuri was also kinda Mary Sue imo<br/><br/>The ""Sneakers"" was never mentioned again in the movie. Shame.<br/><br/>Killmonger's motive was good at first, then turned into weird racial politics with no convincing reason at all.<br/><br/>The Rhino seems to be able to identify friends from foes who actually were allies, too.<br/><br/>Predictable, but in MCU it is okay.<br/><br/>Too much CGI<br/><br/>I loved Thor: Ragnarok, it was a fun movie with exciting moments and fair storyline, but Black Panther did not achieve the same level as Ragnarok. Maybe I went to the cinema with my high hopes and expectation which was failed to be met. I thought a lot about writing this down because it seems contradict with almost everyone's opinion. On IMDB, the movie was first rated 7.1, the a massive influx of 10 pulled the rating to 7.9 where it is sitting right now. For me, this movie deserved a 6/10 at best."

I loved black panther in Civil War, but this entire movie just didn't work well. I understand we needed to be introduced to Wakanda before Infinity War, but this movie just felt forced.

","A fairly entertaining film with touching moments if you dont think too much about it. <br/><br/><br/><br/>
*SPOILERS*
To be fair, im just stating points that ruined the movie experience for me so dont get offended by my petpeeves.<br/><br/>Is anyone bothered by the fact that T'Chaka is ""forced"" to kill his brother in order to save zuri? i mean, that guy have a suit made of near indestructible vibranium vs a guy with a handheld pistol. Do he really need to sink his claw into his brother chest immediately and ultimately killing him? he could have just disarm his brother or just stand between them. The whole conflict of the movie could have been avoided if T'Chaka isn't o trigger happy with his claws.
And somehow the law of inertia doesn't apply in wakanda because a 3tons charging rhino can just stop immediately and the rider sitting on it doesn't even budge. This ruined a perfectly cool scene for me because there's no weightage behind it. 
Also, the power level of vibranium is awfully inconsistence in this film. It's supposed to be almost indestructible yet a car made out of it was destroyed by a hand energy cannon. FYI, i didnt assumed the car to be made of vibranium myself, they stated it themselves in the movie. Somehow i feel like Captain America vibranium shield is very much stronger than the vibranium depicted in this movie. Just me? ok..."

","I would recommend it for anyone wanting to view a movie with strong black characters and some rejection of stereotypes. It is rather brilliant on that aspect. However, if you're looking strictly for a super hero movie, you're going to be disappointed. The best action sequence is already in the trailer. Andy Serkis is completely wasted as a villain. He literally dies half way through the film, and not in any brilliant way. Every plot element has been used dozens of times before. They completely miss the opportunity to tell the back story of Erik Killmonger. Rather they explain it in narrative. They literally add a token white guy in Martin Freeman's character. He was totally irrelevant to the film, and you didn't feel like he connected Black Panther to the rest of the Avengers in any way. They make a point of mentioning he was a pilot, so you knew immediately that would play into the finale, but it is really forced.<br/><br/>I really, really, had high expectations based on a superior marketing campaign. And I understand the over the top reviews based on the significance of a predominantly black cast. But this movie comes no where near matching onscreen the hype off screen. If you want to watch a really, really good Marvel movie, you'll have to wait."

Heck, this isn't even the first black superhero in film, so that's not even new. <br/><br/>In my opinion hyping a movie because it has a lot of black actors is just as bad as not liking a movie because it has a lot of black actors. I'm just saying. <br/><br/>With that said, the actors in this one did a good job, I liked them all, even the villain. <br/><br/>The CGI wasn't the best, but then again maybe I'm just getting burned out on movies that rely on CGI, and let's face it Marvel relies a lot on CGI. It just seems like the CGI is not getting better.

Add the necessary social/political context and it becomes a film much needed for many reasons. Easily one of the best Marvel films I've seen and possibly sits at the top for above mentioned reasons. Weakest parts of the film were a couple of minor CGI action sequences and the unnecessary Martin Freeman character. Strongest parts was the rest of the action throughout, a fantastic cast who acted their roles perfectly and the solid storytelling. An excellent film from the combination of directing, writing, acting and special effects."

I welcomed this like a breeze of fresh air, and not only because of the aforementioned diversity of the characters but because of the quality of the movie as such. After being misrepresented lately by dull and ridiculous movies like the last installments of Captain America and Thor, the famous entertainment company can now promote Black Panther as a good sign of recovery.<br/><br/>Well acted, fun, humorous and passionate movie. This time Marvel allocates the epic and eternal battle of good and evil in the African continent, having its people as the protagonists of the story. Combining science fiction and fantasy, the decently written script leads the spectators through a well passed course of actions, supported with outstanding visual effects and a colorful and imaginative depiction of a richly recreated African universe.<br/><br/>A most welcome addition to a cinematic universe in need of fresh renovation."
"alindsay-al","8","65","171","13 February 2018"," A great new addition to the marvel universe
","After his appearance in Captain America civil war I was so excited to see Black panther reappear and I have now seen this film and i really enjoyed it. The premise of the film sees prince t'challa return to the secluded technologically advanced african country of wakanda to become king, when he is challenged with threats foreign and domestic. Chadwick boseman reprises the role as t'challa and He is fantastic in the role, he plays the charismatic leader very well but even more he delivers a great mix of humour and drama to this rich character. The supporting cast is one of the best assembled in marvel history so let's start with Michael b Jordan who plays the villain in this film and I found his characters journey to be one of the more interesting parts in the film and made me care about the conflict between him and t'challa. Lupita nyongo plays a love interest in this film but she is a very strong character, also her and bosemans chemistry is really good in this film and you enjoy there flirting. Danai guirra of walking dead fame plays the head of the kings guard and she is great in this film, she is great in the majority of action scenes and is a well fleshed out character in this film. In my opinion the show stealer in this film and most surprising performance by Letitia Wright who plays his sister Shuri in this film, she isbhis tech specialist and I just loved her charm and she really added a lot of energy to her role to make her such a likeable character. Martin Freeman, Andy serkis, Angela Bassett and forest Whittaker all do well in there smaller roles. The story has a great coming of age story here for t'challa and it is really interesting to see this countries uniqueness and there tribes diversity. I also liked the way the villain tied to the hero as it felt real and personal to watch. But there is a portion of the story I didn't really like which I can't talk about due to spoilers. The script has a brilliant mix of humour and drama that gave this film the best of both worlds, it was funny when it needed to be but dramatic when it needed to be. The style of the film has some really unique looking sets with great use of technology and colours to make this film stand out. Though I feel like especially towards the end of the film the action relies overly on CGI and it doesn't look that good especially for a film in 2018. Overall black panther is a great film that should be seen especially if you love these marvel movies."

How about you tell an entertaining tale for EVERYONE to enjoy watching instead of making a film that insults white people to the enjoyment of black people?
I REALLY wanted to like this film and I was very impressed with the cast but after the fourth insult towards white people, couched as ""jokes"", I simply lost interest and re-filled my popcorn.
I get it. Black history is full of oppression and wrong doing by whites. I don't even argue that point. Want to REALLY stick it to the oppressors? Make a movie highlighting all your accomplishments, and there are many, showing a mature, strong, even-keeled, heroic leading man and woman and celebrate all that makes black culture great. All accomplished in spite of oppressive whites and without thumping them over the head, but rather by ignoring them.

superpowers this guy has. Including a mysterious mineral that gives those who use it some real staying power. Kind of like kryptonite.<br/><br/>With technological advances we can sure do more with these superheroes than
could have been done in Hollywood's golden era. But I think the real reason
these films are so popular is that real life isn't providing us with that many
heroes to admire. Sure easier to root for Marvel Comics creation.<br/><br/>Anyway Boseman's father died and being the crown prince he's the logical
successor. But in the hidden kingdom of Wakanda you can get challenged.
Something like the way the Klingons choose their leader. Boseman defeats
one challenger, but another one, an exile raised in the mean streets of Oakland played by Michael B. Jordan emerges and he takes over for a bit.
Boseman is down, but not out.<br/><br/>Kids and Trekkie types will certainly love this. Not my particular cup of tea,

Innovative, well-crafted, and culturally significant entry to the Marvel Universe is a feast for the eyes with beautiful, breathtaking scenery, strong, captivating characters, but most importantly it's a very personal and compelling story with political overtones that raise serious, penetrating questions about the modern world.

"TheNabOwnzz","1","13","27","5 May 2018"," A ridiculous mess of hero villain clichés, cringy dialogue and political correctness
","The entire concept of 'Black Panther' with a third world country that is supposedly technologically advanced is, ofcourse, utterly ridiculous. This means this movie was probably doomed to fail from the start, yet the mess it has turned out to be is just an affront to cinema in general. <br/><br/>There are a lot of problems with this big pile of garbage, and naming all of them isn't really possible in a single review, so let us pick out the most obvious ones. The general core in a film is its story and storytelling abilities, combined with compelling characters and character development. All of these things Black Panther has failed terribly at. It is a terrible and nonsensical plot about this country in Africa being a technologically advanced nation, yet they still fight for the crown of king like a bunch of barbarians? A plot can transcend realism factors with its story, but it cannot transcend ridiculousness, which is what this movie has done. This in turn makes it empty, with no characters to care about and no story to care about, because it is such an absolutely ridiculous bunch of nonsense it isn't possible to relate to. As if it couldn't be any worse the plot is incredibly predictable. A certain person appears to die but you know he didn't. A certain person is a mysterious outsider but you know who he is already. The villain can also kill the hero but prefers first to speak a few words so someone can save him.<br/><br/>Unfortunately even though the movie itself is terrible, it is also covered in a SJW political kind of cover. There are a lot of messages that one needs to help the entire world, and all of the women guards ( What a joke ) fighting like they have some kind of superpowers is just tiresome feministic ridiculousness once again. It is just laughable that the supposed greatest 'warrior' and general of wakanda is a woman, it makes you think about what kind of wimps the men are like there. Nonsensical feministic message once again. If the art form that is film has turned into this kind of social propaganda, there is little feature left. Bunch of nonsense to keep the feminists and social justice warriors happy is all the message is here, no morals and no psychology.<br/><br/>The actors unfortunately also leave much to be desired. Everybody has this weird african accent that makes it look like they can barely pull a bucket out of a well yet we are supposed to believe this nation is technologically superior, just a joke. This is excluding the villain ( Michael B. Jordan ) in the film who is even worse as he talks like some idiot straight out some hood in the Bronx and combines this with his weird head uptilts and gestures and 'Bro' dialogue that is as out of character as can be if we want to take this idiot seriously. The movie did start out with a decent villain in the form of Andy Serkis, but he was unfortunately replaced halfway through by this idiot. Not to mention the weird cringy facial expressions especially the woman warrior makes all the time.<br/><br/>We once again have cheap CGI as an excuse for nice cinematography, but it just looks bloated and ugly and not at all authentic, as it will always be. Greenscreen cannot possibly replace the seduction of natural lighting in actual beautiful environments, and it is also the reason this movie just looks ugly. The fight scenes feature terrible choreography with superhuman jumping and weird moves which you might have seen a lot in a couple of terrible videogames. It also includes a scene in which the villain and hero fight in midair, reminiscent of the absolutely terrible fight between Neo and Smith in Matrix Revolutions, but this one is just as bad. You can tell all of the fighting and the moveset is just pure CGI, there are no impressive athletic skills, just videogame jumping around nonsense. There are also a couple of scenes near the end which are stolen straight out of Return of the King and Star Wars, as if this already mindless project ran out of further ideas.<br/><br/>With terrible actors, terrible acting, terrible cliché dialogue ( Especially by our forced delivery cliché fest master Michael B. Jordan ), irrelevant political messages, ugly cinematography, ugly choreography & mediocre modern day music Black Panther isn't just bad, it is indeed, a disaster for whom i can name no good points."
"louehp","1","11","22","3 March 2018"," Wakanda or...
","Why is Black Panther the biggest scam of all black movies ever??<br/><br/>Have you wondered why so much promotion has been lavished, on this
studio production (gathering by the way the youngest pearls of black
cinema), and worldwide...
At least the fact that a big studio embraced such a project should
have made you tick...<br/><br/>What's the message? What bs is hiding behind it?
Here it is, my 'brethens', in a nutshell:
Black social case kid with strong revolutionary message is a big
threat to money, white of course-even if here it has been given black
faces. It is an Orwellian tale, indeed...<br/><br/>Who is Wakanda? Wakanda is peopled by Oreo Cookie duplicated ad
nauseum, it is OreocookieLand as a matter of fact-or what Malcolm
would have called the House....brothers, whereas social case kid is the
Field....brother. Thus, Wakanda elite have the money, the knowledge, the
power, and most important they share knowledge with white dude. By the
way, white dude talks black and he lets you handle everything because,
of course, he is 'mr. niceguy'. (By the way, have you ever seen a white
dude taking a bullet for a sister? I haven't...not in this world we live
in.)<br/><br/>Doesn't it seems to you that Wakanda is the Western World with a black
face - like a masquerade, a new minstrel show, every black man's hope,
deep inside?<br/><br/>So, of course, you have again symbols of dependence -Mr. Nice guy will
of course help oreocookie peeps. The second addiction, which I had
already noticed in Blade, is a drug-here it is some ancestral blueish
hallucinogenic 'thang' they drink, as if they could not summon enough
strength within, and of course, 3rd addiction: prayer, this time to
the ancestors. Of course, you have the ridiculous gear that Marvel
heroes always wear...the one piece suit, that make men's ass real
tight...They even threw in some martial arts to try to make it look
real...Come on, peeps!<br/><br/>Yeah they sold it to you fine, this one! You've got gotten...You've been
played! So who cares if all the cast is black? Down the line, we've
gotten bamboozled one more time.<br/><br/>Watch out people: what they want is to make the struggle wrong.<br/><br/>Of course social kid, the 'black monster' (even defined as such by
King of Wakanda) is given as a product of your own doing-since his
uncle abandoned him, which erases all the real bad conditions of
systemic racism and you were so excited that almost everybody
(finally!) is black in that movie that you did not see the real
message of this real killer movie.<br/><br/>Because it is here to kill our thirst for justice. It makes justice
seekers the monsters. What is really at stake here is the fear of big
money, at the emergence of an educated black intelligentsia issued
from the ghetto.<br/><br/>And wait with all the promo...they have created a cornucopia of products
to sell you, because money has to be made again, on black folks'
dreams... An orgy of shopping for lack of hope!<br/><br/>The only thing i can tell you is: go beyond appearances. Hollywood is
a cliché machine whose strongest function is to create ideologies,
sets of beliefs to live by. And the well being of black people is
still not on their very conservative agenda!<br/><br/>Beware what they feed you lavishly...They would not insert money into
anything that could topple the power of their chosen elite.<br/><br/>My thoughts go to the black panthers-the real heroes who fought for a
cause and died in shame and bad repute... This film repackages the
concept into something hollow, a farce that does not render to these
dedicated fighters for black freedom the recognition they deserve!<br/><br/>After 2nd thought, I deem the fostered division between the diaspora
and the Motherland the most treacherous message of that flick.
Imagine. Africa would stop being a cash cow, if ever Blacks united
beyond borders: they killed panafricanism once for all!<br/><br/>And if you ask me, I'll say - I'd rather watch again:
Undercover brother, Baadaass, Get out, Do the right thing...etc. These
were soul movies.<br/><br/>My review of Black Panther does not question the brilliant performance
of its actors. I still think the cast was outstanding and the
cinematography impeccable!<br/><br/>Hey...They might even give it an oscar;
i'll call it the Oscar of all Scams!<br/><br/>Damn, they also got me too...And sorry to burst your little Marvel bubble!
It's wake up or Wakanda!<br/><br/>Wakanda, or...Wake up right now!
Which one will you choose?

","I like equality as much as the next man, but Hollywood is driving this too far. It seems they can't stop making excuses for not having enough movies with women, all races that aren't white and people with handicaps. Just watch one of the last Oscar shows, and you get what I mean. To me, this movie puts the black people even more in a corner, out of which they are trying to escape from for years. Let's give them an exaggerated accent (I didn't know Jamaica was an African country), big lips (with a saucer implanted in them), an ancient tribal culture and let the tribes fight among each other. Then make sure that, even though Wakanda is extremely rich and technologically advanced, the people in the kingdom are poor peasants. Now the acting. That was, in my opinion, some of the worst acting since all 300000 episodes of ""The Bold and the Beautiful"". I guess every colored person went to the movies because there finally was a black superhero, thus explaining the record breaking box office. They should all ask for a refund, for making ridicule of their race. The only thing missing to make things worse was the Black Panther smoking weed on his throne. What's next Marvel: which minority group are you pushing through our throats next."

"namob-43673","3","5","8","7 March 2019"," Most overrated MCU movie and extremely generic
","I managed to see this movie again during the weekend, preparing for Captain Marvel, and I felt I had to do a review on this movie. Especially since Cap was such a great movie in comparison.<br/><br/>Black Panther is not only the most overrated MCU movie so far, I would go so far as to say it is one of the most overrated movies of all time.
It is not horrible bad per se, it is just so darn boring.
The reason it is so boring is partly because it is super generic - bad guy wants heroÂ´s stuff/title, bad guy fights good guy and ""wins"", good guy comes back reinforced/trained/equipped or with allies and wins in the end. That is it. That is the movie. Which would be fine-ish if the movie had something else to offer, but except for clothing and music, it does not.
The second reason this movie is so boring is because there is no excitment - the movie is so predictable that after 10min I could tell you exactly what would happen. Well, I did not know that the villain, who is the most Hitleresque character I have seen in a movie, had ancestors jumping into the sea dying because they wanted to be free. He was Wakandan, no slaves there.. so what was he talking about?<br/><br/>But yes, lets talk villains. Claw was great for the time he was in the movie, and the Rhino dude had decent motivation so okay I will buy that. But the main villain of the story want to spread weapons, conquer, and save people that ""look like him"". All in a nationalistic very neo-fascist fashion. Almost all of his speaches mimic Hitler, if you do not believe me, check out a clip of Hitler and compare. Uncanny likeness. And this is a villain so many can relate to? Weird.<br/><br/>Something else that stod out was the bad CGi, what happen Marvel? Why suddenly so bad computer graphics? The two CGi suits fighting in the end took me so far out of the movie that I starting to think of what to eat for lunch the day after.<br/><br/>And finally this is the most political Marvel movie to date. In some aspects I both expected it and can think it is necessary - it is very hard to talk Africa in this context and not mention slavery. HOWEVER, In the MCU, Wakanda is located just north of Lake Turkana, at a point bordering Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, and South Sudan. Do you know who took slaves there historically? It was not white men, nor christians... so... why was that not mention?
And the wall thingie at the end, was that really necessary? Felt out of place, out of character, and too much on the nose.<br/><br/>I give this a 3/10, and I think Black Panther is the second or third worst Marvel movie so far. As part of that universe it should perhaps not be overlooked by fans, but otherwise I cannot recommend this at all. So, so boring movie. Even The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, all of the Thor movies, hell even Justice League, was more fun then this. Not bad, just bland, boring, predictable, extremely generic, and did I mention boring?"

"TheHonestCritic","4","5","8","14 February 2019"," So many great superhero films out there, but this one gets nominated for ""Best Picture""? WHY?!
","DISCLAIMER: Before you read my review, I want to ensure all of you that I am 100% not racist. I don't like this movie, it has absolutely nothing to do with the race and culture. I love the superhero Black Panther, and I enjoy the African people and learning about their culture. This movie does establish the sets/Locations, and special effects well, but nothing else. Any way, back to Black Panther. When I first found out he was joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe I got excited. Black Panther was great in ""Captain America: Civil War"", and Chadwick Boseman is a perfect actor to play this role. Then came the solo movie ""Black Panther"", and..... Well, just read my review below.<br/><br/>""Black Panther"" (2018), there has been a lot of hype surrounding this ""movie"", even before the first trailer was released! Many Marvel fans had a lot of hope and expectations, was it worth the hype to me? To be quite honest, no. I was very disappointed with this ""movie"". Why? The ""movie"" is an overall dull and boring experience from beginning to end. I kept checking my watch to see how much time was left, and I also fell asleep numerous times! I almost walked out of the theater. But, this is not the first Marvel movie that I've absolutely hated. There are other Marvel movies, along with some other different films not related to Marvel where I almost walked out of the theater. However there are positives for this ""movie"", but very few. (I ALWAYS TRY TO SALVAGE ANY POSITIVES OUT OF ANY MOVIE I SEE.) First off, the special effects are first-rate of course, Chadwick Boseman is a good actor, and a perfect choice for the Black Panther character. But, I think Black Panther works better as side character, or a team player in other movies. Also, the sets and locations in the ""film"" gave it an interesting atmosphere. But sadly, those variables did not help the ""movie"". I'm struggling to give this ""film"" a 2 out of 5 star rating on my personal scale. On IMDB, every two stars count as 1 star on my scale. So, that means it gets a 4 out of 10 on the IMDB scale. Unless you're a fan of the Marvel films, I suggest skipping this ""movie"" and saving your money. I am kind of happy I saw it though, I just don't think I'll be seeing it again."

"linskeyd","3","5","8","23 September 2018"," Would've been better without the ""political commentary""
","To get this out of the way, I review movies based on their quality not their message. And this movie is ungodly average. To get the goods out of the way, suprisingly the villain was alright and had a pretty good story arch and the story overall was entertaning and kept your attention. Now onto the list of bads. First of all, for a marcel movie the CGI sucks. There was not one scene that I saw something in CGI and thought it was real. Somehow the main character, isn't even the most interesting/compelling character in the entire movie. The Black Panther (the character) has no real personality that I could see (Please tell me descriptions of his personality so I can piece that together if possible thanks.). The humor in this movie made my eyes roll to the back of my skull. Black Panther's sister made a ""What are those"" joke and at that time I felt like leavin the thearter and screaming for the next hour.Now a marcel movie isn't made without a good villan right? I mean the villan is fine, but his motives and his plans are so laughably stupid. (SPOILERS PAST THIS PART) The villan Killomonger feels like Africans must get revenge on all Caucasian people because they have been oppressors throughout history, basically he wants to kill all white people using wakandas advanced technology. Okay okay, fort of all, nobody and I mean NOBODY on earth in the MCU would let that happen. Remember the avengers are still a thing, and one black panther knock off vs the avengers(plus other hero's and he'll probably some villains) just seems so idiotic. Plus the villan is an SJW proporganda machine, and it's hilarious.(OKAY MAJOR SPOLIER IN 3 2 1 YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED) When Killomonger dies at the hand of The black Panther he goes to see the sunset over wakanda and it's a pretty cool scene... until Killomonger opened his bloody mouth. He said, and I quote ""Throw my body in the ocean, so I can join my ancestors who jumped off the boat instead of becoming slaves"" and at the part I died laughing so did my two friends and a couple other people. They ruined my favorite shot in the movie with dumb political commentary. The action is meh. Whenever Black Panther is fighting anyone you never feel tension because he is virtually invincible. Not even kidding he took bullets to his head while in his suit and kept running like it was nothing. While on the subject of action the violence was so toned down for that PG-13 rating. At the end of the movie, Killomonger slits a soilders throught, and while there was a close up on her kneck, there wasn't a single drop of blood. It was honestly hilarious. Any ways I can't believe that people were threatened with violence because of their opinion of this movie. There is nothing special about this movie that could change the world or anything like that. The only chievement is that it was the record for the largest grossing movie directed by a black director whic is pretty awesome. The problem with this movie is that could've been something great. So this a below average movie in my opinion."

","Just watched this movie. While it made great attempts to be a great superhero movie, it misses a lot of the things other Marvel movies does great. The first thing that quite bothered me was the tribe aesthetics they wore, I understand that Wakanda is from Africa and they wanted to reflect that by using ancient tribe aesthetics but it does not work well with modern technology. They should have just stuck a modern style. Nothing wrong with Africans wearing modern suites. There is a significant amount of humour missing in the movie, I wish the amount of humour was more something like Thor Ragnarok. Cinematography and fight scenes were not all that amazing. Michael B.

","The movie frames itself as though the character arc of the protagonist is meant to be the focal point of the movie, while in reality he goes through the whole thing with very little variation or change occurring at all, with motivations so similar to the main antagonist it can be hard to determine why the viewer is meant to root for one over the other. <br/><br/>Speaking of the antagonist, this movie's villain is probably the most two dimensional one seen in a Marvel movie to date, with the possible exception of Maliketh. The guy is whiny, arrogant, and, to be honest, stupid. If the movie didn't bend over backwards to force the conflict between him and the protagonist, he wouldn't have accomplished half of what he did in the movie.<br/><br/>And on top of all of this, by the end of the movie the only real contribution it makes to the MCU is something that was already established in prior films. In fact, if anything this just presents things that contradict what we already know from movies like Age of Ultron and Civil War."

The sounding wasn't that great, it seemed a bit unrealistic, even fake at certain times and out of tune with what was going on in the movie. But the story just didn't cut it for me. There was allot of action, you know the typical American production where everything blows up, cars flying up in the air and crashing with their wheels spinning. And amazing flying machines hunting eachother like in a video game. But it makes one wonder, what do wakandas really do? Or what do they do for fun? And one would expect that the advanced people of Wakanda would be sufficiently educated as not to kill eachother in a medieval style fight. So overall a decent movie, with a leaky leadership battle storyline and allot of overtones about black emancipation.

"zdfranz","5","5","8","28 February 2018"," Nothing New
","As a movie critic, my chief responsibility is to tell you whether a given release is worth your time and money. While this can often be answered with a simple 'yes' or 'no,' a longer explanation is typically necessary. Not so here. Black Panther, for all its positive buzz and fresh casting, is a Marvel movie: if you've enjoyed their past films, you'll probably enjoy this one; if not, you'll be just like me.<br/><br/>Which, if you've read my past reviews, may come as no surprise. But this time was supposed to be different. Beyond achieving Marvel Studios' highest Rotten Tomatoes score ever (97%), Black Panther garnered one of the highest-grossing opening weekends, and now second weekends, of all time. Surely such unprecedented success was the result of a fresh, inspired product.<br/><br/>On paper the story, though perhaps overstuffed, holds plenty of promise: the kingdom of Wakanda, in the heart of Africa, is seen by most of the world as just another impoverished nation. But in reality, thanks to a rare, all-powerful compound known as vibranium, it is the planet's most advanced civilization. Wakanda's clean streets and futuristic technology are hidden within its earthly dust like an alternate universe.
The king, by right of birth and physical combat, wears not a crown but the suit and special abilities of a warrior-a Black Panther. T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) has just inherited this duty. He has strong support and a good heart, but must contend with a newfound challenge rising from the past actions of his father.<br/><br/>There is much more, but the tragedy is that it hardly matters. Why should an audience parse the depths of narrative details-how can it-when the film itself seems incapable of breaking the surface?<br/><br/>This, mind you, is not the fault of the stellar cast or offscreen talent. It is the result of a homogenization of creativity, as if, before beginning a new Marvel project, each participant must sign a Disney contract sacrificing their individual vision and style for the good of the prevailing formula.<br/><br/>An example: most of the Mission: Impossible films are surface deep as well, but at least we can readily identify their directors through the look and feel of each entry. From Iron Man through Black Panther, eighteen Marvel movies have employed the diverse talents of Jon Favreau, James Gunn, Shane Black and Kenneth Branagh (among others) behind the camera; good luck guessing which director belongs to which film. <br/><br/>Now, this could all just be me. It's clear the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) was meant, before anything else, to simply be fun. But how long can fun last when every outing feels the same? When there are no stakes because there's no chance the hero will die before the next sequel is made?<br/><br/>I say all this because I've always loved blockbusters-Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Independence Day, The Lord of the Rings. The best ones all have their own unique magic. But whenever I watch a Marvel movie I feel that magic slipping away. Depth, subtlety and intelligence have never been hallmarks of the blockbuster, but when did we stop even reaching for them?<br/><br/>If it feels that I've neglected Black Panther specifically in this review, know that each word applies to it. And that's the problem. Despite a wealth of rich characters and conflict, the film has little identity outside of the Marvel brand.<br/><br/>It's similar to the time producer Kevin Feige, chief architect of the MCU, discussed genres within the franchise. He labeled Captain America: The Winter Soldier a political thriller, and he was right. But compared to every other political thriller, it was just another Marvel movie."
"lukejmullins","3","5","8","27 February 2018"," Disappointing
","Black Panther is one of the most over-hyped disappointing movies of the year so far. Just like The Last Jedi this move flops in many key departments making Disney's cash cow a boring uninteresting standard run of the mill Marvel movie. Before I dive in there is some good things about this movie like the villian. Michael B Jordan does a wonderful job making his character, Erik Killmonger, a sympathetic villain and easily the best part of the movie. Anyways my first problem with movie are how generic just because it is about an Africa does not make it deep. The main character is really just your standard superhero there is not much to him which weighs down the movie since we spend most of our with him. Most of the side character are not fleshed out at all and really do not feel anything for them when they are in danger. Another bad thing is the action scenes they just look to fake. Whenever an action scene happens Black Panther is Cgied and so are most of the backgrounds making them really dull and not entertaining. The only good part of the film the villain is given little screen time when he is easily the best part of the film. Even though the movie does a good job fleshing out his motivations I wish he was given more screen time so we did not have to deal with the other characters. The movie also tries to weigh in on politics without doing anything thought provoking or powerful. This movie was very disappointing especially since the critics praised it so much."

","I do not understand the hype about this movie. It is made by competent people who know their craft and know how to elevate an average screenplay to a visual spectacle. Strip away the CGI and what have you got left? Well a standard script that works in Hollywood. Hero becomes king after tragic loss, hero is brave and honest, hero is immensely rich and then it is time for the fall and then of course he gets back on his horse and wins the day and gets the girl. The formula works with a twist here and there but nothing to testing. And it ends like other Hollywood dreams no matter how advanced and technically savvy the world they created is, it always ends up with a fist fight. 
It is not as comedic or refreshing as Deadpool or Guardians Vol1, it is better then Iron Man or most of the other MCU productions. It lacks a spirited hero, this one is bland at best. It has no awesome bad guy with great one liners. it features no memorable characters. Some good actors are here Forest Whitaker, Angela Basset, Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis but King Lear it is not. It is a comic book made into a movie and it has no deeper meaning then that. It will kill 2 hours and you won't get bored, a second or even a 3rd watch is a waste time."
"drewd-20229","10","19","43","21 February 2018"," An Iconic Movie
","Although I see a lot of people writing bad reviews based on the opinion that it was ""over hyped"", to me, this film exceeded the hype. <br/><br/>I would consider myself a pretty average superhero fan, holding Marvel movies to a basic standard of good action, fun dialogue, engaging plot and thought out characters. This movie easily checks off all of those categories, while bringing others into the spotlight such as stunning visuals, well developed world building and lore, diversity in casting, thought provoking villains and complete badass-ery. <br/><br/>As much as I can rant and rave about this movie, I noticed one critical flaw. There's a point in time where the writers decided to force the rotting corpse of a dead meme down the audience's throats that really took away from the atmosphere. Not one person in the theatre laughed, while lots were groaning in disappointment. 
Black Panther has it's own quirky dialogue between characters that counts as ""fun"", but if you enter the theatre hoping for Antman, Avengers or Guardians, you will be let down. Try and appreciate the movie's more serious tone as they tackle heavy topics such as classism, racism, segregation, globalism, terrorism, and many other ""isms"" worth addressing on the big screen. They do all this, without making the movie feel like a college lecture, but an entertaining superhero flick. <br/><br/>Ultimately, Black Panther gets all of the right kinds of conversations started. To me, this movie outshone the spotlight, raised the bar for all other superhero movies, dropped the mic and left me speechless. I don't want to go into much detail so as to prevent spoilers, but let me leave it at this: you NEED to see Black Panther."

","=========Preface==========
Okay, so I will start this review, as many others by adressing the elephant in the room, the dumb drama about racism, blacks, whites and whatnot. I am not one to get offended by such things, I barely care about stereotypes regarding black and white people.
I was a bit worried having read reviews that stated the movie is a pro black, anti-white supremacy, opressors etc. Fortunately, it was not the case. There were a few lines, that, taken out of context, might lead one to believe the film has such views, but no, not the case. Thanks for that, Marvel.<br/><br/>==========Actors & Acting===========
Okay, so the cast was, okish, not the greatest chemistry between them.
Chadwick Boseman felt a bit off in this one. I liked him very much in Civil War. I believe he stole the show there, but here, he was a bit cheesy at times. Maybe it's the writing, the setting, I don't know. He has some good scenes though, and puts on a good act depicting strong emotions.(Particularily, his second trip to the Ancestral Plain, was somewhat memorable for me)<br/><br/>Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger was quite a good character, although, same as Boseman, has his cheesy moments. He overacts quite a bit in some parts, trying to inspire authority and fear, but I'll let it slide.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is quite forgettable, I feel like Nakia(Lupita Nyong'o) was more of a nuisance to the story(not the actress, just the character), Shuri(Letitia Wright) had her funny moments, but that's about it, Bilbo Baggins(Martin Freeman) seemed bored in this movie and Gollum(Andy Serkis) well, still with his Precious I guess.<br/><br/>7/10
===========Story & Plot==============
Not much to say here, it was the weakness of this film. It was predictable, forgettable, no twists, nothing special really.The villain plot revealing Wakanda's ""murderous"" past had some potential but wasn't explained quite in depth.
6/10
===========Image & Sound============
They meet today's standards, Wakanda was spectacular, although blurry at times. The soundtrack was ok. The action scenes were good, chaotic(which is usually bad, but here I think it fits), not overly long when not needed.
9/10<br/><br/>Conclusion: It was a good movie,with good and bad parts. It's not a masterpiece, but it's definitely not bad. It's in my top 10 as MCU movies go. I am glad it wasn't a black propaganda as some people claimed it to be.
7/10"
"isantistao","1","3","4","6 April 2020"," There's Nothing Good About This...& It's Affirmative Action At It's Worst
","There is literally nothing good about this movie. When I saw the commercials and learned of the premise I really wanted to like it too. I mean the whole idea of a African-esque mythology/mysticism based super hero movie was almost too good to be true for me, because I am actually very into African Shamanism & Folklore. I was so enthused for this movie that I tried watching it three separate times. But every time I tried watching it the results were the same. Every scene was excruciating to watch, and I couldn't suffer through more than 20 minutes or so, it was just so bad.<br/><br/>As I said, there is nothing good about this movie. And that includes every aspect of the film making. The writing, the acting, the directing, the production, they are all complete crap. They are literally so bad that it is surreal.<br/><br/>What this movie is is one of the biggest works of over-dramatization of all time. This film is more over-dramatized than I have ever seen anything ever be, including Aquaman, and that is saying a lot. It is the same style of unrealistically overdone writing and acting you would see in a B movie, but when a super overdone production as well. The movie looks like it costs more than any movie ever made, but it sounds and plays like it was written and directed by high schoolers. It is so bad that every scene and every bit of dialogue was just so over the top and forced that it was painful to watch and listen to. It's just not natural. People don't talk and act like that. And story's don't happen that way. Its utterly ridiculous.<br/><br/>The only reason this movie was made in the first place, and was so ""acclaimed"" by whatever idiots thought it was good, is because of affirmative action ""black power"" aspect. This movies aforementioned african folklore style of storytelling and theme, and its all black ensemble made it a SJW statement that anyone who considers themselves a democrat, liberal, activist, etc would have to declare is the best movie of the year...for the purpose of promoting affirmative action for black people. But this is a movie, and we need to judge it as a movie. And as a movie, it is not at all good in any way. Objectively speaking, if you were to replace the all black cast with a cast that was all white, and all of the SJW's didn't look through the black power promotion lens at it, it would have never gotten good ratings. Because it may very well be one of the worst movies of all time. And that is coming from someone who has seen thousands of them and studied them. So I am not making that statement lightly. Like I said, I tried watching this one 3 times. So I certainly have enough perspective here and am not being small minded.<br/><br/>It would be much better to promote black artists/art by promoting the best of it. You cannot simply applaud a movie that is absolutely terrible just because it has only black people in it. These are adults, not toddlers. They should have the same standards to live up to as the rest of the film industry."

","Sorry but the whole family found this really boring. Was such a surprise after the box office records and Oscars.
Glad to find a place where people have put honest reviews as the critics reviews don't make sense.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was good and cinematography impressive but I believe the storyline was slow, predictable and lacked depth.

","Im gonna sound like a broken record here but the movie was honestly bad. It was way overhyped and overrated. The overall feel of the movie was good, I like that they made a movie that has a different feel/culture to it. The visuals were ok, but the very bad CGI fight at the end ruined it. To add to that everything felt forced, the jokes were just...I could tell they were trying to hard to appeal to the audience.<br/><br/>This movie is kinda like a one time watch sorta deal with me. Like I said before, the movie is bad, however, the actors and actresses are amazing, yet it feels like the movie should've complimented them more.<br/><br/>-RR"

"sl-83579","3","3","4","20 July 2019"," Cannot understand and feel wired
","I really have a big question about this movie.<br/><br/>Is Africa a country? Do Africans share same culture even if they are from different countries and might hate each other in the history?<br/><br/>Definately no.<br/><br/>But Killmonger, who grew up in the US, seemed not understand that and not really respect African diversity and Wakanda culture. Himself may suffer from discrimination in the US. But there is no reason for him to ask Wakanda people to fight for all of African. He just supposed that Africa is one entity.<br/><br/>It's wired.<br/><br/>Will Amercians fight for Candians/British or share their tech just because they are all white people? All live in the same continent? Or share the same ancestor?<br/><br/>Will Japanese people fight for Koreans and forget the war history between them? Will Vietnamese save China during crisis? These are all asian countries. Maybe Hollywood is too arrogant to distinguish them, but these cultures are quite different. They will never stand together only because of skin color or they are asians.<br/><br/>Killmonger just ignore this huge difference and so did Marvel. The film just depicted a Hollywood Africa again. People live in love and peace. People will help strangers only because their skin color. (Since Wakanda is so developed, it seems impossible to catch them as slaves. So they really have no reason to help other African people other than color.)<br/><br/>When you make a film of other culture and did not really think about about it, you get Black Panther. This movie does not really respect African countries.<br/><br/>Disappointing. I hope Marvel would show some real diversity."

"MadMickle","5","3","4","10 March 2019"," Very Generic, Overrated, Average Superhero Film
","So to start off, the movie seems pretty cool. Black Panther has been bestowed a super suit from the Gods (aliens). The intro begins by explaining how the Wakandans (people of Wakanda) received all their futuristic tech. I won't burden you with the details, but basically, the setting is actually a pretty neat ""Afro-Futuristic"" one.<br/><br/>Multiple tribes inhabit Wakanda and fight over who will become the next king. Although the method is sort of tribal, it plays into the idea of what it would be like if tribal African groups suddenly received a futuristic basket of technological goods. They would still attempt to retain their culture while adapting to the new tech.<br/><br/>As for the superhero part, T'Challa is the Black Panther. He does have a charm, but is still very generic. As for the villain, he is absurd and ridiculous. His acting was comparable to a robot reading from a script! Not to mention the anti-white attitude displayed throughout the film from him. On another note, the attitude towards white people in the movie is very poor as not only the villain, but the ""Good Guys"" set this anti-white narrative as well. I won't dwell on this, as it's not a major thing, but definitely comes up at least four times throughout the film. The beginning fight scene and the car chase were pretty much the only entertaining parts for me. The ending fight scene was a bit pathetic. I just couldn't have any real attachment to any of the characters so none of the fight scenes really mattered. Overall, it was entertaining, but there are a lot of better superhero movies out there. This just doesn't make the cut for me, resulting in 5 out of 10 Stars."
"jamesdanieljones","2","3","4","8 March 2019"," Felt the film was too political changed

"jtindahouse","4","3","4","20 February 2019"," This is considered Best Picture worthy?
","I remember being disappointed when 'The Dark Knight' wasn't nominated for Best Picture ten years ago, but also understanding that superhero movie aren't really what the Oscars are intended for. So when I saw 'Black Panther' had been nominated I thought it must be a truly incredible film and was looking forward to seeing it. What I got instead was a painfully boring, unoriginal and uninspired movie that shouldn't be anywhere near a Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards.<br/><br/>I've seen some boring superhero movies in my day but this would be near the top. Twice I had to pause the movie and have a nap because every time I would try to watch it would put me to sleep. There wasn't one character I felt any connection to or interest in. The hero was bland and the villain was equally so.<br/><br/>I can only think this nomination refers back to the #Oscarsowhite controversy of a few years back and the Academy's determination to rectify that. It's a shame because there are some truly great and worthy films of 2018 that highly deserved a nomination in 'Black Panther's place. There are very few redeeming qualities about this film. I would not recommend giving up your time or hard earned on it."
"lucas-dylan","5","3","4","14 February 2019"," What's so special? 7 Oscar Nominations?
","The movie wasn't the worst I've ever seen, but to be honest it was far away from the best I've ever seen.<br/><br/>There is something original about it when we look through the eyes of a black society with only a few white people. I respect and like that idea... that's a big plus but honestly the movie is actually nothing more than a action-fantasy story in a Avatar-Batman-Star Wars mix. This is a Marvel movie for children cause it doesn't have to tell grown up people much. It's about entertainment and there is a big difference to ""BlackkKlansmen"" in the quality of story-telling, acting and message to people. This time it's about a black Superhero in a black society. I'm not hater of those movies but some of them are just really dumb. What I don't like if they try to make the concept get more serious. I find that ridiculous and feel like I'd rather watch a movie that doesn'T combine our world with Superhero worlds. This fantasy trying to become real which doesn't work to me. ""BlacKkKlansmen"" does address that rather directly which I prefer. This movie shouldn't be on the Oscars more like a typical action movies and get nominations in irrelevant categories like effects or sound editing but not for ""best picture"". This is ridiculously overrated and more relevant movies would be better in that category instead.<br/><br/>I vote 5 stars which I think is actually too much. I feel that it is sympathetic concept somehow. But when I had to vote like this movie really was as experience I'd say 2-3 stars."

Then, there a scene right out of 007 movie, where the hero is introduced to new gadgets that we'll see later in the movie. Be grudgingly I bought into that. Then came the first ""real"" action scene that took place in Korea. After seeing that mess, I just couldn't bare to watch any more of it. I know many people have given this movie high marks and truly enjoyed it. For me, it felt like a nut with a very hard shell.

","There are things we know.<br/><br/>° The technologically advanced show their power by fighting. (Though really their most impressive feat is containing a rhinoceros in a rickety wood rail fence.)<br/><br/>° Powerful female warriors are all tall, thin, striking, and beautifully dressed.<br/><br/>° Bullets bounce off magic unitards. (Of course we've known this since the first Superman comics were printed. Well, I guess I didn't know it quite that far back, since that was before I was born back in the Middle Ages.)<br/><br/>I understand why it was popular: the social shift, whose importance I don't dispute. But otherwise I saw little to recommend it; that social shift deserves better -- deserves real characters and drama, not poor comics. At least a third of the movie is spent in fights (seemed like more ... they felt interminable), which drew far more on CGI than on choreography. The plot is shallow and uninventive. Yes, few things in art are truly new, but this hardly has any new slants. I look at the long list of quotes from the movie on IMDb and don't see a single one that I'd call interesting.<br/><br/>Stereotypes abound (see above) -- I've probably forgotten some in the days since I saw it. Vibranium bears an eerie resemblance to the magic lozenge that W S Gilbert wanted to use as a plot device and which his equally famous collaborator rejected. I found it insulting that Wakandans' success was basically credited to an accident of place rather than to their skills and ingenuity.<br/><br/>In stories *about* the movie, much is made of African tribes, African history. I did not sense much of that in the actual movie though. Mostly lots of fights and individual posturing. Very little sense of any community. To the extent that tribal customs and dress were represented, they were so subsumed to the action as to be no more than background, and obscured background at that.<br/><br/>Oh, Africa? AFAICT, not a single frame was shot in Africa. Studio work was all done in or near Atlanta GA. The ""British museum"" scene was shot in the High Museum in Atlanta, and the ""Oakland"" basketball court was in Atlanta. They went to the expense and logistics of spending a lot of time filming in South Korea -- scenes which were almost entirely fights. The dramatic waterfall, scene of fights that seem to go on forever, is in Argentina. Africa is represented by three continents, but Africa is not one of them.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is resolutely late Romantic European style, with a few splashes of late 20th century American popular and general movie-score music. If there's anything in it that sounds African, I don't recall it, and don't hear it in the soundtrack sampler on IMDb. Isle of Dogs has more that sounds African. (The soundtrack sampler seems to consist only of the parts by Ludwig Göransson, and there are other soundtrack credits, so perhaps some are more apt. I do hear a bit of kalimba in one of the Göransson samples ... but the string orchestra accompaniment wipes out the African effect.)<br/><br/>OK, it was a superhero movie. I don't watch those -- this was my first ever -- so I didn't really expect much. It lived up to my low expectations but did not exceed them. I don't doubt that (as widely reviewed) it's better than all the other superhero movies, but that's a low hurdle in my book. I recognize that the black cast is an important innovation in this genre and understand why that excited many people, but the genre lags movies in general. I won't say I was bored during it, but in looking back, I'd rather I had spent my time watching something else."

","So I've decided to fill my only remaining gap in the MCU franchise, and oh my God, this wreck of a movie is the new absolute low not just for superhero flicks, but for cinema in general.<br/><br/>It's just horrible in every conceivable way. The plot is disjointed and stupid, with unbearably tedious dialogues and painfully poor acting. Listening to the dialogues is especially repulsive thanks to the African accents the cast is using, so prepare to hear things like ""pentha (panther)"" and ""teeknoludgee (technology)"". Chadwick Boseman especially excels at this, delivering a performance that perfectly mimics a speech impediment and an astute case of autism. Every other actor is just as cringeworthy, except for Michael B. Jordan (partially) and Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman, coincidentally the only two white actors in this garbage. But the veteran actors' serviceable performances cannot pull this trash out of the abyss.<br/><br/>The setting for the movie is also unimaginably ridiculous - apparently there is a technologically advanced African nation hidden in plain sight. However, despite being so advanced, it selfilshly offers no aid to its neighbors, honors ridiculous savage traditions and has its soldiers armed with spears and swords. Thanks, but even a talking raccoon breaks the suspension of disbelief less than this. If ludicrous colorful costumes weren't enough to annihilate the visual aesthetics of the movie, it's also filled with old video game-quality CGI that makes your bleed, so obviously it stands out.<br/><br/>But wait, it's an action movie, right, perhaps there are some thrills to be had? Well no Sir, because about 90% of action sequences are done with the same cheap CGI while the remaining 10% are horrendously choreographed with slow unrealistic motions during fights.<br/><br/>To add to all this bedlam this film allows itself racist phrases like ""Great, another white boy to heal"". The fact that this mucus gained over a billion at the box office is disgusting and shows how far both Disney and the herds called ""general audiences"" have fallen."

","Ever since i saw Captain America: Civil War, i was instantly invested in the character Black Panther. Immedietly after the movie i went home and looked into everything about this character, his backstory, comic lore, etc. And i was so excited that he was getting his own solo movie. But i saw it, and i hate to say this but i was extremely disappointed.<br/><br/>Well this movie is not completely bad, first off all of the characters did an excellent job and when they have an emotional moment, you totally buy it. Even though i am probably the last person to say this, Killmonger is one of the best MCU Villains. I totally agree with what this guy is doing even though his methods of doing so were a little cruel. Also the music was very good. It gave the movie a sense of tone and even gave a little in depth view of other world cultures. Also the action sequences are pretty fun (for the most part). And sadly that's all i have for positives, i just wish i could've put more here.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint of this movie by far was the pacing. The first 30 minutes of the film were a huge drag. Then things start to pick up, then the entire movie feels rushed from there. Also the film's CGI was bad in parts. For example that entire battle sequince at the end looked like graphics you see in a PS2 game. I understand CGI can be a good tool when there are difficult things to add into a movie (I mean armored rhinos isent something you can add in a movie perfectly), but i mean this movie's budget is way to high for the CGI to look like that. Other films old and new have done better with smaller budgets. Near the middle of the movie i told myself that ""It's gonna be a slow burn, then the big pay off with make everything right!"" But the movie does not give you the pay off you want. <br/><br/>So all in all, Black Panther was a pretty average Marvel Movie. I feel like this movie was rushed in the making. It felt like one of the Producers said ""Oh wait we need Black Panther in Infinity War, but he has no movie! Okay we will make a movie about him in the span of 2 years and he will have been a fully developed character by then."" I do believe this is one of Marvel's weakest films. However i wonder, would i have enjoyed it more if i didn't hype it up?"

"zardoz-13","5","3","4","1 April 2018"," Just Another Man in a Hero's Suit Who Happens to be Black
","A groundbreaking magnum opus of cinematic marketing for African-Americans, ""Creed"" director Ryan Coogler's ""Black Panther"" (** OUT OF ****) has demonstrated the impact that a film can create when a single demographic embraces it. The 18th Marvel Studios superhero saga has coined over a billion dollars. Apart from the R-rated Marvel Comics ""Blade"" trilogy, African-Americans have waited patiently for a suitable larger-than-life champion with a PG-13 rating. A largely derivative but a polished escapade from start to finish, ""Black Panther"" amounts to a standard-issue, Panther malice-in-the-palace melodrama. The generational gap in the skewered relationship between father and son in director Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole's screenplay provides this epic with its most thematically compelling material. The son spends most of his time handling the mistakes that his short-sighted father has made. The secret fantasy kingdom of Wakanda shares some similarities with the clandestine island in ""Wonder Woman."" Basically, ""Black"" constitutes an origins story about a hero in a cat-suit with ears and his homeland. Mind you, this isn't the first time Black Panther has graced the silver screen. He made his debut in the contrived and drawn-out ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) where the Avengers broke ranks and swore loyalty to either Captain America or Iron Man. Chadwick Boseman exhibits the steadfast confidence and physical agility to play Marvel Comic's first African-born superhero. Unfortunately, since he is not only a king, but also a politician who symbolizes the status quo, he seems hopelessly bland and straightforward. Boseman needs to jettison the pseudo-African accent that he uses as Prince T'Challa because it sounds synthetic. Comparably, Michael B. Jordan emerges as far more appealing than a ruthless adversary should. As an illegitimate ghetto offspring of Wakandan blood, the charismatic Jordan spouts the minimal number of profanities allowed for a PG-13 rating. Similarly, the dynamic women who surround Black Panther as his elite bodyguard are far more exciting than the ruler they shield from danger. <br/><br/>For the record, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created ""Black Panther"" in 1966 when the character debuted in issue # 52 of first volume of the ""The Fantastic Four."" The film ""Black Panther"" opens as a narrator explains that long before mankind arose, an enormous meteorite crashed into the jungles of Africa. The five tribes of Wakanda would eventually gravitate around the crash site. Described as ""the strongest metal in the universe,"" the vibranium in this meteorite drastically altered the composition of local plant life. The Five Tribes of Wakanda fought without closure until the Panther goddess Bast appeared in a vision to a shaman warrior. Four of the tribes lived together, while the fifth took up residence in the mountains. This warrior found a 'Heart-Shaped Herb' that endowed him with superhuman strength as well as speed. He emerged as the first Black Panther. Meantime, the Wakandans excavated vibranium and forged technology as well as weapons far beyond anything else on Earth. Paranoid that the world would plunder their secrets, Wakanda guarded it jealously and withheld it to keep foreigners from exploiting it. Earlier in ""Captain America: Civil War,"" the Wakanda King T'Challa died in an explosion at the United Nations in Vienna, and his son set out to find the killer. If you've seen ""Civil War,"" you know the killer was none other than James ""Bucky"" Barnes, aka 'The Winter Soldier.' Barnes reprises his role in an end credits cameo for anybody with the patience to stick around and watch it.<br/><br/>Sadly, despite their best efforts to conceal the vibranium, the Wakandans fail. A colorful but cruel arms merchant, racist Afrikaner Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis of ""Avengers: The Age of Ultron""), and a renegade mercenary Erik 'Killmonger' Stevens (Michael B. Jordan of ""Fantastic Four"") shoot up a British museum and steal an ancient Wakandan ax containing vibranium. Our hero T'Challa / Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman of ""Get on Up"") pursues Klaue, but 'Killmonger' beats our hero to the villainous Afrikaner. Meantime, T'Challa satisfies all the rituals before his coronation. He must submit to any challengers who want to fight him for his monarchy. Of course, nobody confronts him since they respect him. As their new King, T'Challa learns about the dreadfully unfair demise of his father's brother N'Jobu (Sterling K. Brown of ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"") and his ghetto-born son. 'Killmonger' challenges T'Challa, and they slug it out in a pool located atop a perilous waterfall. T'Challa appears to finally have met his match, but 'Killmonger' lets him escape. Plunging into a deep gorge where a torrential river flows, T'Challa vanishes from sight. The authorities proclaim 'Killmonger' the new Wakandan king. His first imperial act is to share vibranium with other Third World black countries. Of course, you know 'Killmonger' cannot get away with this perfidy. Predictably, T'Challa may be down, but it isn't entirely out of the picture.<br/><br/>Our hero need not worry about hasty last-minute costume changes. He wears a necklace that deploys his black, one-piece outfit and activates all its myriad capabilities. For example, if you strike him, the suit channels the energy in reverse, and the assailant suffers blowback. The Wakandans boast an incredible arsenal of futuristic weapons. James Bond would envy some of these Wakandan gadgets. At one point, they save an American CIA agent, Everett K. Rose (Martin Freeman of ""Hot Fuzz""), from a devastating spinal wound that would have confined him for life in a wheelchair. English actor Freeman seems woefully miscast as an American. Coogler stages some modest action scenes. Nevertheless, everything about this formulaic adventure remains so by-the-numbers that you can guess the outcome. One of the more interesting characters, Andy Serkis' Klaue, is probably the liveliest, but he gets his comeuppance about half-way through the heroics. You won't be able to take your eyes off Lupita Nyong'o, Letitia Wright, and Danai Gurira. Altogether, ""Black Panther"" ushers long-overdue diversity into the Marvel Comics Universe, but this promising superhero pales by comparison with Wesley Snipes ""Blade"" for sheer bravado and derring-do."

"wiperk-86502","3","3","4","24 February 2018"," mostly boring, stupid, and a plothole fest
","First of all I can really say I am not biased when it comes to movies. and Marvel adaptations in particular. I am neither a die-hard fan nor am I a casual. I grew up with the old Marvel comics and a know a little bit about super heroes, and I like it.<br/><br/>Okay, when I see Marvel I am always somewhat excited, because those movies deliver that saturday night entertainment that I am looking for when I want some good old action entertainment. Especially when I pay money for it in a theatre....
Some good action, solid acting, funny jokes and main characters that I can like. The trailer that I saw for Black Panther looked promising and that movie was a must watch for me as a typical Marvel movie, like Spider Man, Thor, Hulk etc. Little did I know....
Well, after leaving the cinema when the movie finished I was just disappointed and bored.<br/><br/>First of all I hated every single one of the characters and I didn't believe any of them, not even for a second. The acting was terrible, not one of the characters caught my attention. Some of them like the 20-year old scientist Q Lady who greeted the king with a ghetto handshake were laughable at best. And what was the point of having that Hobbit actor in this movie as a CIA Agent? To make stupid facial expressions? He was just a joke. I couldn't believe for a second that he was an actual CIA Agent. There was absolutely no reason for him to be in this, his role was absolutely superficial and contributed nothing to this movie.<br/><br/>Also there were so many plot holes in this, when the movie started I thought like ""Ok, give them a break, making that weird story up with that highly technologic secret city that remained undiscovered in Africa we have to make some compromises when it comes to logic"", but it kept getting worse and worse as the movie progressed and it kept annoying me more and more up to a point where i couldn't almost bare with it anymore.
City in the middle of Africa undiscovered, no heat signatures from satelites? Where do they keep their money, under their beds? No banks involved right, cause it's secret. Vibranium can produce energy...ok...random black Lady is fluid in Korean language....ok.....biggest rivals of the people in the city is a tribe of Gorilla people who grunt and their leader talks like he is slightly mentally challenged....
My god.... it just kept going and going...besides, the whole race-thing that they had going in this movie was just so annoying. I get it I get it, black is beautiful, but why did you have to make one of the 2 white guys who appear in that movie make a batshit crazy villain who dies midway through like a random guy and the other one is a CIA agent that is basically more of a clown than anything else.
The evil black panther guy was he surposed to be like a black ""Joker""? He said he went through he whole life of fighting and killing and stuff, but hey, to me looked like a mediocre actor out of Beverly Hills 90210 who spends his free time pumping iron at Planet Fitness. I couldn't believe his role as a tough guy with the life full of hardships.<br/><br/>Action wise there wasn't really much going on as well. The coolest thing was probably when those 2 cars were demolished by that sci-fi gun that the white bad guy had hidden in his bionic arm, other than that, there wasn't really much going on. Black guy in a panther suit who barely showed any sign of super powers and 2 ladies with vibranium spear, some random people up.<br/><br/>So to sum it all up, I was not entertained by this movie, I did not like it at all, I just can not give it a 1 Star because they put some effort in the CGI.
Would I recommend watching it? Definately no! And believe me that, if you don't watch this movie you will not miss anything at all."

But we have to admit its a quite boring movie. We should know who would win the fight before the fight begin and who's come back to life, thats a problem. Its a really typical superhero movie which marvel not showed to us in thor and civil war (which is great).
The joke had a lot of miss. The character is like just being made 2 minutes ago, even the main villain is not have a clear and builded character.

","Reading the wiki entry on the black panther party: the FBI considered the movement 'the greatest threat to internal security of the country' at the time. Curiously enough, the Marvel comic character also preceded the forming of the party in 1966, though nowhere can you read that it had any influence. Also strangely enough, the new movie encourages the same practises that the party did, namely community outreach and medical clinics. And just like the party, the movie makes it clear that politics is about power. Where the film differs from previous black superhero movies is that the hero here does not live with other Americans in a harmonious melting pot: they are their own kingdom, and vastly superior to the 'colonializers' (word used in the movie, FYI Imdb editors..). Well I guess in the end all superhero movies are empowering to their constituency (spiderman: the geeky teenagers; superman: the goody two shoes; the avengers: the groupies? Thor: the rednecks). That's the positive thing I can see here. The movie is also reasonably entertaining."

","We all know that the MCU, more now than before, has been incredibly inclined towards humour, and in some of their installments have gotten it wrong; e.g. Age of Ultron and Ragnarok, however they've also gotten it right in other films such as Ant-Man and Homecoming. Black Panther, I'm so happy to say, falls firmly in the latter. The humour in this film is so well placed that I can't understand how MCU fails then, to consistently get it right, but I imagine it's all poised on who the director is. With that said, Black Panther is NOT perfect, it is very flawed, mainly due to one very major aspect.<br/><br/>One thing Black Panther just got wrong, was Black Panther himself, and though it may be understandable is to how they made that mistake, as an MCU/comics/film fan, I can't ignore that fact/issue.<br/><br/>Truthfully (and I hope you can try to appreciate this perspective), for these African cultures, unknown to the planet, to be put on the world stage in a positive light through such an established franchise on such a big scale for the very first time, is a moment both ""black"" and ""white"" America and the rest of the world can't fully imagine. Be African, in Africa and watch isiXhosa, a language spoken by millions in South Africa (a country, not an area) on global display, and then the Motlatsi, Sefate, Khotso and Morena (seSotho for King) apparel and heritage being put on the map, then watch Black Panther; it was sentimental, however, that was both a good thing, and a bad thing.<br/><br/>Marvel Studios and Ryan Coogler didn't get the balance right. They focused way too much on portraying a culture and used the Black Panther as it's driving force, and thus neglected fleshing out Black Panther. So, Black Panther was illustrated during a celebration that wasn't necessarily part of the Black Panther arc. That was a major problem. Africa deserves to be recognized by the world, and doing it through Black Panther was right because of it's magnitude and inspiration, however was done wrong, because of the equilibrium.<br/><br/>All that aside however, I absolutely loved the cast; notably Lupita Nyong'o and Angela Bassett,and specifically, Letitia Wright, Michael B. Jordan and Andy Serkis; they were just too amazing.<br/><br/>The visuals were stunning, however the pacing was off from time to time. The score was pretty good, and the story was more than satisfactory while the script was crisp.<br/><br/>Again, Black Panther is not perfect. Pacing, balancing and neglect issues, with an amazing cast that delivered on a solid script with stunning visuals made Black Panther a very enjoyable watch, with a side of; it could've easily been better. 7/10."

However judging the film on the basis of film criticism Black Panther really starts to fall apart.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this film isn't that it's too long, no, just that it's exciting sequences (primarily the action scenes) are spread throughout the runtime very poorly which leads to the film coming off as slow and boring. This is a very common issue within many films, however it is usually fixed by making the plot and characters engaging to watch. This is where Black Panther fails, none of the characters resonated to me very well, the villain's story is much more compelling then hero's story. It is worth mentioning though that the action sequences were by far the most entertaining sections of the film specifically the one set in South-Korea which was the peak of the film in my opinion.<br/><br/>At some points Black Panther's CGI was brilliant and helped massively to expand the world however at other times the CGI was laughable which was best displayed in the final action sequence which looked awful.

","After all the stunning reviews I had to give the movie a shot, i regret my decision, the movie was just average, story was bland, characters bland, and special effects were sub standard at best, if your the target demographic you might enjoy this title but as a grown adult with thousands of movies under his belt, I know a decent movie when I see one, and this isn't one of them, unless you'r a child/teenager, or someone who watches and enjoys every over saturated hero movie that makes it to market, then you most likely wont enjoy this movie much, so unless you want to spend a mediocre night watching this with your loved one, then stay away, unless you want your partner to ask to watch something else 3 quarters of the way through the movie, then spend you time and money elsewhere."

"heisenberg12","5","4","6","29 January 2019"," A Generic Superhero Movie Just With Skin Color Black Instead of White
","All men are created equal regardless of skin color, but this movie, which has gained critical hype that most superhero movies never get is made to seem like it offers something different than any generic superhero movie. Well, it doesn't. It's paint-by-numbers for the genre but like ""Wonder Woman"", it differs from the norm because of skin color (Wonder Woman focused on womens' rights politically). But outside of this, it offers nothing outside of the ordinary, and frankly, I never liked superhero films outside of Batman, Superman, and seldom Spiderman.<br/><br/>Just like my greatest concern with the vast majority of ""superhero"" movies, my biggest concern and knock on them has to do with insulting viewers' intelligence and dumbing down the viewer by playing on a fantasy world that removes all scientific facts and logic of what is known to be reality. This could never happen. And I have to say that this was the one thing that made the one and only modern superhero movie a true classic back in 2008; The Dark Knight brought Bruce Wayne and the Joker into the real world, minus a couple jump scenes. This is pure fantasy and childish, only appealing to kids who don't know better, and it's manipulating them for that for their SJW agenda.<br/><br/>This movie is racist because it is expressing black power over white people as a sort of utopian vision for the future, where white people are slaves to black people, just like Wonder Woman fancies a future where men are subordinated to women in power.<br/><br/>Within 5 minutes, between the actors talking like they're reading off of the paper with no depth and emotion, and the obvious clichÃ©s, I shut this POS off. 5 minutes was more than enough of my time to waste on such tripe. But don't worry, I shut 90% of all superhero movies off within the first 10 minutes, even the ones with white people; the only difference is the ones with white people aren't nominated for Oscar awards and overhyped.<br/><br/>This is nothing more than by-the-numbers comic book flick, but one that is unabashedly racist towards white people."

I was with high expectations only to find out the movie is so flat and plain.
The characters and plot are so weak - it doesn't explain what happens to W'Kabi afterwards - no slight elaboration or explanation on his thoughts and actions before and after; all of a sudden the Black Panther won Erik when he was sooo weak and fragile in previous parts, etc.
So little background on everyone throughout the entire movie. All characters are for sure wasted.
It surprises me the average score can reach 7.4.

","I'm usually the last to see a movie as hyped as Black Panther. My habit is to patiently wait until a film finally become available on NetFlix for a DVD rental. Having read such glorious reviews, I was expecting something spectacular, but upon actually viewing the film, I thought it was rather lackluster. Black Panther was always a ""B"" level character in the Marvel pantheon, and the movie pretty well matches this tier. I kept hoping the film would eventually evolve into something uncanny -- it never did. It's not a bad movie. I wasn't bored. But as a benchmark, I thought Justice League was more entertaining.

And when they get injured there's no sign of the super-duper technology but rather they're reaching for some healing plant or other. It's like you discovered some primitive tribe out in the depths of the Amazon rainforest and found they happened to have iPhones. Weird.<br/><br/>I can't work out if it's politically correct garbage or racist garbage. Are we being shown that black African cultures could be super advanced or being shown that even if they were, they'd still be acting like primitive tribes - which by the way, they're not even now.<br/><br/>All that aside, I found much of the acting pretty awful and the rest of the plot and effects just bog standard. <br/><br/>Overall very average.

No one talks about sharing their tech with the whole world based on merit to make the world a better place with it. Stopping african and world hunger and draught? Stopping war? Stopping energy hunger? Stopping climate change? Taking Earth to the space age? Colonizing the galaxy ? Wakanda doesn't care! They just don't want to share!

","I like Marvel films and really enjoyed seeing Black Panther in Civi'l War but this origin story for T'Challa was poorly executed.<br/><br/>The story was poor, the world building ill conceived (advanced society with thatched huts next to skyscrapers and a feudal king), many of the characters flat out annoying or poorly written and a clear and regularly reinforced race agenda.<br/><br/>I mean there is one scene where the token white guy starts talking and he's deliberately drowned out by black characters making monkey sounds (H&M anyone?) because his voice is not worthy because he's white.<br/><br/>If there was any other Hollywood film where this example of racism happened, the director would include it to clearly signal to the audience that the perpetrator was a bad guy, a character that would get his comeuppance for being so openly racist. <br/><br/>Yet not in this film. In fact he's portrayed as an individual coming to the rescue at the end and his racism simply laughed off. It's like this film was made 50 years ago with its tiresome cheap shots and endless chip on the shoulder rhetoric. It is a weak entry into the MCU and ranks alongside IM2, Thor 2 and Ultron as a Marvel dud.<br/><br/>I have concerns about the impact of this film on Infinity War. I do have faith in the Russo's but capitulating to brainless dross to satisfy a rabid politically correct fan base isn't beyond any movie exec. Watching the IW trailer, it does look like they are fighting in Wakanda so are we really going to have to suffer the pinnacle of the last 10 years of MCU coming to a head in an ill conceived El Dorado just to satisfy a bunch of snowflake SJWs who are the last people that were buying into this glorious franchise.<br/><br/>Just as the wait comes to an end, just as we top the crest of the hill to see the wonder of IW and it's huge assembled cast, are we really going to have to contend with a big chunk of it played out through the lens of this blatant weak link? Are we going to have to tolerate Cap and Stark playing second fiddle to this kind of nonsense? I can't deny that I'm a little worried.<br/><br/>When we have seen what feminism, identity politics and piss poor writing and directing talent can do to Star Wars and a Marvel tentpole, are we not fearful that all of our longing will be dashed on the rocks of a studios needing to signal its moral virtue."

"The-Sarkologist","5","4","6","21 February 2018"," More of the Same
","Once again I probably shouldn't get too excited over movies that I see trailers for because I an inevitably disappointed. Then again, I've probably reached the age where seeing a movie is just another of the endless number of processes that I go through, and since I have seen so many of them many of them cease to be all that interesting anymore. As they say in South-East Asia, when it comes to movies they are pretty much all same same (but different).
 I guess that is what the case was with regards to Black Panther - it was pretty much same same. In fact, in a way, it reminded my somewhat of The Phantom, though that probably has more to do with there always being a person around to take the mantle of the Black Panther, though in this case it is the king of Wakunda. The story goes that a meteorite hit Africa and five warring tribes discovered the power of the minerals in the meteorite and decided to come together as a kingdom. However, they also chose to shut themselves off from the world, and for most of history have been hidden from the eyes of everybody else. In their mind Wakunda is basically just another basketcase African country.
 Okay, there is a little twist in the plot, but in the end it is one of those good guy vs bad guy movies. Basically a prince of Wakunda betrays the country and is killed. His son then decides to seek out revenge, comes back to the country, challenges the king and wins. The king (who is also the Black Panther) then recovers from his wounds and returns to take back his throne, and I suspect you can work out where it goes from there. However, there is one theme that runs through the film, and that is how they should use their technology - should they help the world, or should they continue to sit back and watch.
 This isn't really much of an issue in the globalised world in which we now live, but I guess there is always that question of how one should interact with the world. The thing is that since Wakunda is an African nation, there is a lot of debate within the nation as to how they should react, considering that Africans tend to be, in the most cases, at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder. Yet, it also seems to be a debate between arming them or hiding, yet there is also the possibility of there being a third way - using one's technology to educate them.
 Of course the problem with education is that one needs to want to be educated, because if one doesn't want to be educated then there is going to be a bit of an issue. Still, that isn't really what the film is about, but rather how they should interact with the world. Of course, when one is hiding away in their own little bubble, one fails to see the reality of what is beyond one's borders. This is why many of those who leave Wakunda as spies end up being challenged by what they see, and becoming angry at the failure of the Wakundans to actually do anything about it.
 Anyway, the film wasn't bad, though it did drag on a bit. Interestingly it seems to be set apart from many of the other Marvel films in that the focus is entirely upon the Black Panther - none of the other regulars make an appearance (except for Stan Lee, but he makes a cameo in pretty much all of the films). In a way they may had done it that way so as not to tie to too much into the timeline at this stage (particularly since the Black Panther does change with the king)."
"eligolde","6","10","20","19 February 2018"," Overhyped but far from bad
","This has been touted as a fantastic film by numerous critics, but I found it to be a pretty average Marvel movie. That is not to say it is bad, because there are many things that it does right. The soundtrack is easily the most interesting of any film in the MCU, as it uses a combination of typical superhero/action movie score, African tribal music, and modern hip-hop that blends very well together. Also, the acting and characters are done very well, with three standout performances. Lupita N'yongo is great, Andy Serkis is exuberant, and Michael B. Jordan portrays one of the most interesting villains in the MCU. His character has a lot of depth and he provides a great foil with a potent motivation that is presented as pretty obvious social commentary. But even though it is on-the-nose, I did appreciate that the film actually attempted to get political. However, it is not without flaws. The first half drags a bit with a mix of dialogue-heavy scenes and generic action scenes. In fact, the action scenes throughout the film, save for the car chase and a fight between Kilmonger and Black Panther, are very bland. The filmmakers tried to recreate the same style of action that worked so well in The Winter Soldier, but they fell flat with some poor lighting, lack of grit, and CGI overload (particularly at the end). Overall, the movie is presented in a very generic way, with many of the same beats you would expect from every other superhero movie in the cinematography and editing. Despite these issues, I thought the positives outweighed the flaws and that the movie was an entertaining experience. I'd give it a strong 6/10."
"thesar-2","5","10","20","18 February 2018"," He Just Can Wait to be King
","Serviceable. As many positives this movie featured, the one word that popped up in my head constantly was: Serviceable.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong: the movie's good and there's not much to point to that's bad, but stripping away the great cast, incredible world-building universe and special effects, it's the most average origin story.<br/><br/>The star and best part of the movie, Chadwick Boseman a.k.a. The Title Character, was fantastic and stole every scene. Granted, I would've liked to see him more in his full-body superhero outfit (you'll see as much of him as the Panther as you did Batman in The Dark Knight Rises. In other words, not much.) But, thankfully, he does carry the feature with his great chemistry with the cast and charisma on screen.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the world these characters live in and their mythos was also great to see and unbelievably believable. I knew little to nothing about this comic book's background and for them to set it up so nicely that it became realty, was very welcomed.<br/><br/>Also really nice was that this was a self-contained story in a huge universe. Never opposed to other Marvel characters showing up, even just to say: ""Greetings!"" but it's nice this stood alone. Of course, aside from the setup, that is.<br/><br/>Boseman's T'Challa is still mourning the loss of his father in Captain America's Civil War movie...but, then again, it's only been a week since those events. Nevertheless, he needs to be the new King of his (certainly not a ****hole) nation of Wakanda, he needs to prove himself to his people, himself and his father's spirit and bring in a criminal who's taking a break from Middle Earth, Kong Island and this very MCU. There's much more to the story, but why ruin it?<br/><br/>The movie takes itself very seriously and that's an ENORMOUS relief from Marvel's go-to formula: 80% comedies with 20% superheroing, i.e. Spider-Man: Homecoming, Iron Man Three, both Guardian of the Galaxies and Thor: Ragnarok. Those movies relied almost exclusively on humor and so little on what I bought a ticket for. Mercifully, they kept the humor - which was sometimes funny - to a minimum here.<br/><br/>This isn't a movie I'd rush to see again, mostly because the main plot is so average and predictable, but it's definitely recommended to see once, especially for all the positives mentioned above. <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: As a favor and quasi-birthday gift to my friend, I agreed to stay and see the two post-credit scenes that I usually hate to waste my time waiting for. No spoiler to the content, but a warning: these were two of the lamest I've seen. The first is something we already knew was coming and the second is something we already knew about. There were no surprises and, AS ALWAYS, they were completely avoidable. They're always available online to see so you don't have to spend an extra 20 minutes in the theatre to see 3 seconds of blah."

","I was a little apprehensive going into the movie just because of allthe hype around it. Many times movies can't live up to it. This one? Exceeded all my expectations! The casting was perfect. The visuals, amazing. I was amazed at the detail that went into the costumes and jewelry, and how they reflect those of real African people from around the continent. And the story was great. There were some kinda predictable things, and it did fall into a pretty typical Marvel trope of the good guy getting help from the ""bad but not as bad"" guy. However, it was never trite or boring. The character development was wonderful. Speaking of characters, I am so appreciative of the fact that the women in this movie were fully recognized humans! They had their own thoughts and feelings and actions separate from the main character, which isn't all that common. This movie deserves every bit of hype around it. Can't wait to see what Black Panther and the rest of the crew from Wakanda do in Infinity War and beyond."

","Like many others, i have waited for months for Black Panther to come out. Although i was incredibly excited, a little part of was worried that the movie wouldn't live up to the expectations placed upon it. BUT boy, did it blow my mind. It ended up surpassing my expectation by miles (and i was expecting a lot). It was truly an exquisite film. Chad Boswick acting as the Black Panther was perfection...not one thing was forced, everything he did, he did with grace and ease. Danai Gurira as Okoye was beyond words; she was fierce, elegant and a total badass. Lupita Nypngo, Letita Wright, Micheal B Jordan, Martin Freeman etc..were incredibly stunning as well. The heartfelt acting shined through every actor and actress. The visuals were glorious, the portrayal of African culture in all its beautiful halo was something of a sight to behold. And i can go on forever talking about the beautiful African costumes worn by almost everyone in the movie. This is a film that is educational, honest, visually stunning, humbling and historical. It does not bullshit or gloss up anything. No matter what others say, DO yourself a favor and go watch it. You will love seeing people at the theater dressed in their finest, happy and proud as hell.

"ThomasDrufke","9","36","93","18 February 2018"," Groundbreaking
","In the same but different way, Black Panther is bringing on the same amount of significance that Wonder Woman did last year. Of course, it's crazy to think we're even at this point in 2018 where Black Panther (not the first overall) but the first mainstream superhero movie to have a black lead in years and the first one in the now 18 film long Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>To just say this film is important is an understatement. Diverse representation in films is among the most talked about things in the world of filmmaking these days and Black Panther makes another big step for the industry, especially looking at the box office results of opening weekend. Luckily, the film itself isn't just a step forward in representation, it's also a dang good piece of filmmaking. It should come as no surprise that the guy who made Fruitvale Station and Creed once again knocked it out of the park with Black Panther.<br/><br/>Let's start with the cast because even before a single trailer, the cast was the thing that stood out of the most. For me, Chadwick Boseman stole the show in Civil War a few years ago. He made an even bigger impression than Tom Holland did as Spider-Man. His calm but fierce presence was unmatched and brought an entirely different vibe to the characters already in place in the MCU. Boseman, who has already played some pretty iconic people (Jackie Robinson, Thurgood Marshall, and James Brown), is perfecting the role of a lifetime right now.<br/><br/>Alongside him is an incredibly talented supporting cast including Angela Bassett, Sterling K. Brown, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Andy Serkis, Forest Whitaker, and of course Michael B. Jordan. Nobody is wasted and all of them are well-written and fleshed out. Jordan instantly ranks in the top 3 or 4 Marvel villains (which isn't the hardest thing to do), and his performance as Killmonger was full of thoughtful planning and empathetic beats. So much so that I understood what he was doing and why he was doing, even if I don't agree as to how he was accomplishing his goals.<br/><br/>But I've gone on far too long without mentioning the ladies of Black Panther. Wow did I love Gurira's noble and powerful turn as T'Challa's guard Okoye, Nyong'o's gentle but courageous turn as Nakia, and Wright's hilarious and energetic turn as Shuri (who is essentially Q to Boseman's Bond). There are other great beats by actresses in the film, but those 3 women are absolutely incredible in this film. <br/><br/>There are some familiar story beats from say Thor or Iron Man, but I always say that even if a movie isn't original in story, but is presented and executed in a new way, then it's all worth it. Which is a very long way of saying , Black Panther is a uniquely satisfying piece of cinema that might as well change the way superhero films (perhaps all films) are directed, produced, written, and acted worldwide. Wishful thinking sure, but it seems like there's been a shift since Wonder Woman, so why not after Black Panther?<br/><br/>9.0/10"
"emilioh","10","42","111","15 February 2018"," It's the first Black Panther movie
","Don't compare it to an Avengers/Civil War movie, there isn't more heroes than the Black Panther. And it's great first movie, they explain a lot and we get to know Wakanda and its people.
Don't know why some people react negatively on the villain because he was great, he was someone who lost his father att a young age and thrived only to have revenge(psycho).
If you only want action than wait for Infinity War."
"jesiahandchanelle","9","66","184","17 February 2018"," Culture Inclusion
","I feel sorry for those who have watched this film and gave it poor ratings because the actors don't act like your average marvel ""American actors"". I've grown up around Nigerians and Kenyans and I can tell you for sure the acting was spot on. They captured their culture and mannerisms in a respectable manner. 
I've seen most of the marvel movies and was growing bored until this movie. It actually has a message in it that's not to be missed. I've never experienced that within marvel movies. It usually features the same plot and the same cheesy ""good overcomes evil"" message. But the message portrayed in this movie is one that highlights current issues and should truly be taken to heart.
On another note, I feel so proud of the lighting, makeup and wardrobe used to highlight the beauty of black people. I often feel the lighting on black people within movies and TV still in this day and age makes them look washed out and grey. This movie truly makes their colour shine like pure gold! It was beautiful just to watch this even without the plot. 
My hope is that the character of Black Panther can bring depth into the Avengers movies and take the plot to a whole new level."

","I am from Portugal and finally i was able to see the movie.<br/><br/>I need to write this little review, because i noticed that many users are making fake´s reviews and it´s noticeable that they didn´t saw the movie (see the news about the facebook group that wants to sabotage this movie).<br/><br/>Contrary to most people that talked about the action being great (because they thought they could use that to throw people off), the action wasn't as great. Some Shoots were too dark and some scenes had some annoying jump cuts, so overall it was decent to good, and maybe one great action scene. The pacing of the movie was odd at certain times, but nothing that can damage the movie.<br/><br/>Very solid acting all over the place, even from minor supporting cast. They were able to introduce some comedy through the personality of some characters organically, and sometimes the females characters took the movie and had great spotlight's, making the main character look like a secondary character.<br/><br/>The Villain...oh my, take Loki away, this is the best villain that MCU has right now (for me, even better than Loki). That is very apparent when you can understand and agree at some extent with is point of view. Even when you know his plans will bring chaos to the world, maybe because of his charisma, you want him to win at some extent.<br/><br/>Great shoots of Wakanda and great world building.<br/><br/>Great Story, with political views, they even manage to give appropriate screen time to all the characters, with essential dialogues and action.<br/><br/>I will give it a 8.0/10.<br/><br/>It´s definitly a very good comic movie, but i need to see it again, to make a final judgement. Right now, is not better then The Avengers, CA: WS or CA: CW (this 3 are on another level), but i think that from the 18 MCU movies, maybe he deservers the #6 or #7 spot."

"gerry_barnaby","7","33","85","13 February 2018"," Good but over-hyped film with flaws
","One seriously don't go into this film think its a racially motivated film, if you're looking for this to fuel some anger and use it as a political standpoint to fuel a race war then you need to check your moral campus, because this film is completely opposite on political views which address a lot of the world issue not just in Wakanda, some of which that were mention in this film I agree with.<br/><br/>But I'm not gonna spend the whole of this review explaining the political side of this film, although most of these motive from T'Challa played brilliantly by Chadwick Boseman show a man seeing the past mistake of his ancestors and wanting to make the world a better place through help each other and become as one tribe there for each other. <br/><br/>But know that its ok to help each other but the world has its issue that it must overcome in order to bring peace and help each other, me person not even reading or know anything about the comic books of black panther, watching this film I understood his motives and passion, not just for his own people but to help the world as well.<br/><br/>If you never read any of the comic books this film does do a great job in giving black panther a backstory while helping you understand his character and motivate. I personally love the lion king style reference which was a nice touching moment for this film with the animal spirit guides.<br/><br/>although the film doesn't really represent Wakanda as Wakanda is a fictional place based on the nation in Africa like Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, South Africa, and the Congo more like an amalgamation of these real African nations, economies, and cultures.<br/><br/>Which is represented in trial by combat for leadership and the woman shown as strong African warriors kind of like the amazons which is shown perfectly in the film with Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira playing these role along with ladies playing warriors There is also a few moment where we get some funny moment which does overdo it like most other Marvel films have done in the past.<br/><br/>Even the whole casting is pretty good in this film along with its acting but it does suffer a lot of problems, not that this is a bad film, there are a few things that make this a pretty average film and not a perfect one. By far out of all the Marvel villains Micheal B Jordan is best so far in having a true motive to be evil but with one flaw in his story playing Erik Killmonger. <br/><br/>With the mention of this black panther being the James bond of the comic book universe I would say total true on that part with Letitia Wright play a technology expert like Q from Bond films, so in a way, that reference is true which actually works.<br/><br/>Although this of what I said is all the good parts of the film, there is a lot of issues the film has which will be addressed in dislikes. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Dislikes : Few problems with the film one being the main villain, which is a shame since Michael b Jordan playing this role is the best villain they have done by far, the problem here is that he doesn't get enough screen time as the film focus too much on the political and tribal side of the film.<br/><br/>Which is ok which puts more focus on world issue and the conflict with T'Challa having to be a king while protecting the world around him, but as the main villain of the film there should've been more focus there as well because it seem that michael b Jordan character was only relevant in the 3rd act, he only become the golden jaguar for the last 30mins of the film. <br/><br/> This is what I mean by the film being unbalanced too much focused on the political side which drag the film down slightly.<br/><br/>The other issue is some of the camera work it like the camera person can keep the camera still for 5 mins, there were a least 20mins of the film that was slight shaking, the some of the action scene again with this shaky camera. This show complete amateur filmmaking when a director has to rely on shaky camera effects for action screen, it the most hated thing in a film every, i urge film make to stop using it."

","I watched it and was floored at the ridiculousness of this. It's every cliché from all the other superhero movies from the last ten years buuuuuut it's based in Africa. Next will be China. Basically there's a country with no immigration, that frowns on intermarriage with outsiders, and with a technology-based wall around it to prevent outsiders from getting inside (yup) that somehow becomes the most highly-advance country in the world where everyone is as smart as Tony Stark but most people still choose to live in huts while the monarchy lives in a palace and no one resent this. Whenever someone else discovers the secret, the military (all female, of course) gently gets the outsider to keep the secret. Despite THEIR poverty, the outsiders agree to let the wealthy Wakandans keep their secrets and their wealth while the outsiders continue to live in poverty. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created a guy in a spandex suit fifty years ago who was athletic with elevated strength (not super). Now BP is basically wearing a suit of armor (like the new Spider-Man) that absorbs energy and sends it out again and uses gadgets like Batman and Iron Man. The new production team decided to cobble together all the witty banter and clichés from the last ten years and package it as something new.

It delivers a witty, action-packed epic moments and brings a vibrant twist to the comic book movie formula while remaining true to the Marvel Universe it belongs to.<br/><br/>It tells the story of T'Challa who, after the events of ""Captain America: Civil War,"" returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to take his place as King. However, when an old enemy reappears on the radar, T'Challa's mettle as King and Black Panther is tested when he is drawn into a conflict that puts the entire fate of Wakanda and the world at risk.<br/><br/>Okay, even if you are not a fan of superhero movies... you may find the issues explored thought-provoking. It is well acted, dazzlingly shot by an expert cinematographer Rachel Morrison and full of humour. Black Panther is an untold story in modern cinema; a story about black people completely untouched by colonialism, who exist entirely outside the global systems of institutionalized racism.<br/><br/>This movie has a fast beating heart because it ain't just sincere for good sake but it is a heartfelt epic that doesn't fall flat. It's the kind of art that's star-strikingly theatrical, but not even for a moment does it feel forced.<br/><br/>The score is authentic, the movie has an electric rhythmicality; every scene bounces as if dancing to the beat of its own drum.<br/><br/>In the context of values, Black Panther serves as an intelligent if broad debate between revolutionary rhetoric and the responsibilities of leadership.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, this is one superhero film that definitely punches above the normal crash-bang-wallop weight.

The theme was seen in M:I-4 and Skyfall, where Team Black Panther have to hide and use their brains.

For me he has only increased his reputation with the industry and I cant wait to see what he does next.<br/><br/>The cast are all really good in the film, Lupita Nyong'o, Angela Bassett, Andy Serkis, Daniel Kaluuya, Forest Whitaker and Martin Freeman are all really strong throughout the film. However there is no surprise to say that there are two standout performances in the film, firstly Chadwick Boseman. He is really good in the film and has a interesting character arc throughout the film, he shows a lot of range in emotions. Definitely an improvement from his cameo in ""Civil War"" and I'm interested to see where the character goes next. However for me personally the standout of the film is Michael B. Jordan as KIllmonger. He is simply fantastic from to start to finish and the best part to his character is the fact that you can understand his motivations. In a strange way I felt a lot of empathy for his character even though he is the villain, one of the best villains in the MCU for a long while. <br/><br/>Negatives <br/><br/>Now unfortunately this is where I start to get confused where all the praise for this film is coming from because at heart this film is nothing new. The story of a young man being named king after his fathers death, weaving his way through the early stages of his monarchy. Only then to have it taken away by the revengeful character who comes into the film and ""kills"" him. Miraculously is then found to be half alive, come its a MCU film what else did you expect, sent back to his kingdom to have a showdown fight with the villain.....the end. Is it me or is that story familiar and not that original really, like don't get me wrong I understand the social messages of the film. I understand what an amazing achievement and landmark moment in cinema this is but I was expecting more, considering the praise this film is getting. I had even seen some reviews of this film being on the level of ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Logan"" which is insulting to those films to say the least.<br/><br/>The only other complaint I have is that the CGI here and there is a little hit and miss, there are some waterfall scenes that look a little jarring, but other than that it was fine.<br/><br/>Overall its ok/average 60% out of 100 or 6 out of 10, it is nowhere near as good as I hoped or thought this film was going to be considering the incredible praise this film has. Even though I didn't personally particularly love it I can understand why people do, I can also understand why people don't love this film and both of those opinions are valid. Directing very good, performances really good, other than that its just your run of the mill MCU film and not that mind blowing."

","I left the theater with mixed feelings. Although the special effects were great, the story was just another cookie cutter Marvel version of yet another superhero with really no fresh ideas or design. On top of that, the action was just average or the same to any other previous Marvel movies. I'm sorry but it didn't blow me out of the water. The hype was just that, all hype. Even Michael B. Jordan could not save this movie from the dull and monotonous of the plot. And I wanted to like this movie so much! But it failed in so many ways. I left feeling so disappointed!"

","This movie was amazing! So many black issues dealt with in an important way from traditional vs. modern, black on black crime, difference between African American and Africans, division vs. unity in the black community, how to be a white ally, and much more. The jokes were funny, if you didn't laugh it's because you are most likely white and took the film too seriously. While the film was serious, it had comedic relief that was real and dealt with how whites have treated and still do treat blacks. If you were white, you're feelings would be hurt if you took it too serious. This film is about black excellence, hope, tradition, changes, Love, sadness, mistakes, slavery, fixing the past, and changing the future. While the world thinks Wakanda is a third world country, it's adtually the most advanced in the world! You hear that, an AFRICAN COUNTRY IS THE MOST ADVANCED IN THE WORLD. More advanced than the United States which is majority white. And Africa would have been the most powerful continent in the world if it wasn't for those meddling Spanish and European colonizers.

","Marvel's Black Panther origin movie was a given since the character was introduced to MCU audiences in Captain America Civil War, the hype for Black Panther was incredible however the movie didn't deliver. I believe that Chadwick Boseman aka Black Panther half arsed the role, his voice kept changing and he seemed to be rejecting some of the lines he said, he felt like a completely different character from Captain America Civil War. I was rather disappointed with how there were minimal references to the MCU story line which with Avengers Infinity War so close you'd think there would at least be one. Overall the action in the movie was fantastic and exciting just like your typical Marvel movie should be, however the movie was let down by the acting by the protagonist and side characters."

","First, the acting was so bad. Angela Basset and Forrest Whitaker are some of the worst actors working in Hollywood.

","The high rating and the outrageous box office would be definitely a myth to me, just like the American voters would vote an ego maniac into the White House.

I have to say it again, this film actually sucks big time, poor script, poor acting, the overly messy background paintings with the poor CGI effect, making this film like a rush job to meet the release date. The scenarios also feel contradictory enough since futuristic tech somehow only belongs to a few, the traditional weaponries, such as spears, axes, knives and fist are still the main fighting tools used. There's only one flying machine and the tribal council and the council members sitting around to have a meeting looked more like what we've often seen in ""Star War"". Why the leading character got to put on the weird WWE mask before facing or dealing with any new situation? Does it mean the mask would give him some super(natural) power? But even this guy put it on, he still looked very deadbeat tired and emotionless. There's no showing of any passion or even enthusiasm from him at all, even the fighting for his dominance at the big Fall in front of his tribe, he still look half-hearted tired without energy; maybe because he didn't wear his mask? I really think he was a miscast.<br/><br/>Anyway, you deserve it, this and that."
"leo-pacheco","6","9","19","19 February 2018"," High Expectations, Disappointed Results
","Let me start by saying I had high expectations about this film based on the trailer and all that was riding on this new addition to MCU. A fan of the Black Panther comic as a kid, I was really looking forward to this movie, and excited to see it!<br/><br/>The graphics were incredible! The costumes and choreography during the fight scenes were great! Some of the actors were better than others, but overall, the acting was pretty good. Props and scenery were amazing!<br/><br/>So, what's missing? <br/><br/>Frankly, the story line, which lacks substance (except for a few socio-political lines), feels a bit rushed, repetitive, and bland. <br/><br/>****SPOILER WARNING****<br/><br/>Namely, Black Panther is crowned King and goes through a spiritual ritual to take on the mantle. He then learns he has a cousin. Cousin shows up and wants the throne. They battle it out and cousin wins. Cousin goes through the same spiritual ritual to become king. Meanwhile, Black Panther, is assumed dead. His girlfriend steels a magic herb before they are all burned by King Cousin. Later, girlfriend, sister, and Panther's mother discover he is not dead but in a coma and being cared for by a rival tribe. Mother gives him herb as he goes through the spiritual ritual a second time. He comes out of the coma, takes on King Cousin, and wins back the throne.<br/><br/>It's like take, rinse, repeat. <br/><br/>Although the movie is over two hours long, it seems like they rushed to get it all in, yet it still lacks substance. <br/><br/>One reviewer said the humor was ill-placed, and I would agree. In the middle of a serious moment, quick one-liners were intended to be funny, but for the most part only deserved a slight chuckle, clearly lacking Thor's most recent comic-ridden outing.<br/><br/>Plus, the movie focuses a lot on the female warriors, who are supposed to be supporting characters. Instead, they often overshadow the Black Panther, making him look weak and unimportant. Don't get me wrong, I like the female army. They kick butt! However, they often appear stronger than the main character and he gets lost in the background at times.<br/><br/>I can overlook most of it because every movie has its flaws. And had the story line been better, this movie would most likely have been 2018's big breakout! Monetarily, I'm sure it will do well. But I have a feeling it will be a one-time-only movie without repeat viewers spending their hard-earned money to get a second look before it goes to Redbox."
"OtherShipwrecks","6","9","19","17 February 2018"," Bourgeois Ideology Masquerading as Progressive
","Throughout most of Black Panther, the central political antagonism is one between non-violent nativist isolationism (represented by T'Challa and his ruling-class cohort) and pan-African anti-colonial revolutionary struggle (represented by N'Jadaka/Erik Stevens).<br/><br/>The problem with this antagonism is that N'Jadaka, the radical revolutionary and the primary antagonist, is also portrayed as a warmongering maniac (fueled by childhood trauma and motivated by vengeance) who wants to rule over the world. This is precisely what radical anti-colonial thinkers like Frantz Fanon have warned against - the biggest danger of anti-colonial struggle is establishing a new oppressive regime in the place of the old one. In the film, N'Jadaka is trying to do precisely that - to play the colonizer's game against themselves and replace white hegemony with black hegemony. In this respect, the film, being a thoroughly ideological product, eagerly conflates radical struggle with totalitarian ambitions. Although it tries to make the audience sympathize with N'Jadaka's motivations, its ideological message is clear enough - political radicalism is a psychological pathology that must be defeated.<br/><br/>Towards the end, T'Challa changed his mind and no longer believes in a nativist approach to an increasingly interconnected ""multicultural"" (read: global capitalist) world. So what does the film end on? A reformist and assimilationist politics combined with a bland and complacent liberal humanism. Let's build social outreach centers in black neighborhoods without challenging the political and economic mechanisms that make structural inequality and mass incarceration possible. Let's share our resources with the world, sing Kumbaya at the UN and forget about the systematic exploitation of Third World workers and the endless imperialist wars fought in service of global finance capital. Let's uphold bourgeois peace and defeat those ""crazy"" radicals. Let's ignore the institutions and the people who are actually responsible for large-scale human suffering and just hold everyone's hands and celebrate our ""shared humanity"". Is it surprising that all this ideological garbage is coming out of a mainstream Hollywood superhero film? Not at all.<br/><br/>For all the ""smart"" political commentaries and metaphors, Black Panther is ultimately steeped in the same hegemonic logic that it pretends to challenge. Black liberation is and has always been about struggling against deeply oppressive colonial and imperialist regimes. All this history of antagonism is conveniently erased in favor of a comfortable, feel-good bourgeois humanism."

","First, it's important to remember that this, like all comic book to screen films, is derived from material that is made to appeal to the intellect of a 14 year old so the plot lines will not help anyone's quest to understanding the meaning of life (its just a movie folks!). The historically significant and ground breaking fact that it has a (nearly) all black cast and the impact that will have on the audiences, Hollywood producers and the earning potential of non-white actors going forward is noteworthy. Basically, it is a well crafted film with generous amounts of humor and suspense sprinkled throughout and, peeking at some of the reviews here before seeing it for myself, I expected less but got much more.

"sonnygoten","7","7","14","22 February 2018"," Lion King x Avatar = Black Panther
","The Black Panther setting made me think of Avatar on many occasions. The whole tribal vibe is alike. Vibranium is basically Unobtanium; and both Wakanda and Pandora are pretty much the typical isolated ""hidden elf village"". The difference is that Wakanda has lots of tech whereas Pandora is less tech-advanced, but for all that it matters to the story Wakandan secret tech power might as well be Pandora's mystical Eywa power.<br/><br/>As for the plot, the Black Panther Shakespearean drama reminded me a lot of Disney's Lion King. Basically it's a 'What if Mufasa killed Scar, then after he dies and Simba becomes king, Kovu decides to walk in Scar's footsteps?' plot.<br/><br/>It's all not exactly original, but good popcorn entertainment for a Friday night out when you want to dial down your brain for a moment. Visuals are stunning, characters are engaging to watch, and while I would've enjoyed a bit more comedy I still enjoyed what was delivered.<br/><br/>A few small annoyances did continue to niggle at the back of my mind:<br/><br/>1a) No country, empire, community, etc. has ever been technologically super-duper advanced and rich while at the same time pursuing an isolationist policy. Just check world history, everywhere isolationism happens, it sends people back into the Dark Ages or (even worse) the Stone Age! So, unless the Wakandans were snubbing their fellow primitive humans in favor of open trade borders with Asgardians, Kree, and other Marvel aliens, a technologically advanced but isolated Wakanda is a complete socio-economic impossibility.
1b) Related to the above, technologically advanced countries never rely on a single person for all their tech. Shuri is great, where are the other Wakandan geniuses?<br/><br/>2) Why was only the king allowed the super herb? If Wakanda industrialized the cultivation of that herb, they could've created an entire army of super soldiers to protect their borders; no need to pretend to be a third world country. Furthermore, that herb could boost human productivity like super-coffee, increasing Wakanda's economic output by miles an turning them into a superpower greater than the USA and China combined! Where is my Wakandan hegemony??<br/><br/>3) Wakanda is a highly advanced society that chooses its leader with a good old fist fight. Really?<br/><br/>I get it, it's a comic book movie, so there isn't anything inherently deep or realistic about it, nevermind realpolitik. Still, call me a nitpicker, but for some reason these 3 points continued to annoy me throughout the movie, not that it wasn't entertaining."

","It was hard for there to be stakes in Black Panther because the Avengers Infinity War trailer exists. As a viewer you know that the film will ultimately end with T'Challa alive and the country of Wikanda in a good situation because that's exactly what the Infinity War trailer shows. The film does offer good and enthusiastic performances from its cast most notably for me Andy Serkis' Klaue and also showcases the interesting culture of Wikanda but it does suffer from formulaic Marvel trends such as reluctance to kill off major characters and weak villians. While the film does focus on the themes of international relations between countries and racism its attempts to get the audience to think about these matters feel forced and sometimes juxaposes the films sometimes humourous tone. Overall, I feel that the film offers strong special effects, performances and it has interesting story elements but ultimately it fails create any tension or invest its audience during its 2hr 14 minute run time."

"mitchell5954","8","5","9","25 November 2018"," Good, Though A Tad Overrated
","Black Panther is the latest MCU movie. After he appeared in Civil War, there was much hype for Black Panther getting his own solo film. After seeing it I think this is the best MCU movie since Civil War. Is it the best MCU movie? No. I feel like every time one of these comes out now everyone praises it as the best in the MCU. Critics said that about Thor Ragnarok when that came out. I liked that film, but really it was an okay film at best. Black Panther is definitely better than Ragnarok. I'd it's actually a genuinely good movie, but not without its faults.<br/><br/>The general cliff notes plot is as follows. With his father dead, T'Challa/the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) is now the king of his home country of Wakanda, the most advanced, and secluded, nation on Earth. However, our main villain Killmonger challenges the new king's reign and attempt to use Wakanda's advanced technology to dominate the world.<br/><br/>First I'll delve into the positives. Firstly, I really like the Black Panther as a character. I was already impressed with him in Civil War, but I wanted to hold off judgement until he got his own movie. Now I can say Black Panther is my second favorite MCU character behind Captain America. The side characters were pretty decent too.<br/><br/>The film has great cinematography as well. The majority of the film takes place in Africa/Wakanda and it looks fantastic. Not only that, but the film does a fairly good job delving into the culture of Wakanda and its inner workings, backstory, and political stances and issues.<br/><br/>Most of the action was good and shot very well, with a couple exceptions, which I'll get into. I also like the style this film has, from its opening and closing aminations, to its score, to even way of using text and credits. You'll know what I mean when you see the film.<br/><br/>Killmonger, in my opinion, is one of the better MCU villains, up there with Loki and Zemo. His goal is rather basic, but his motivations are understandable to where you can sympathize with him to a degree. Michael B. Jordan does a great job in the performance as well.<br/><br/>The film is not perfect though, as I've stated. The movie has the same issues the Thor movies do. The scenes in Wakanda are great, but the scenes in our society, while not bad, don't measure up in comparison. While most of the action was good there were a couple underwhelming scenes. The opening action in particular was shot too dark and filmed with much shaky cam that it was hard to enjoy. The final fight between Black Panther and Killmonger was also too short and underwhelming.<br/><br/>Lastly, the minor villain played by Andy Serkis I did not care for at all. Andy Serkis is a great actor, but this was definitely not one of his best performances. I don't blame Serkis, but more the lines and direction he was given.<br/><br/>Overall, Black Panther is a very solid entry in the MCU. Is it the best like so many say it is? No. Is it revolutionary, like many claims? No. Nevertheless, it's still a good movie that's worth seeing if you're a fan of the MCU or just comic book or action movies in general."

So let it not be said that I cannot enjoy a comic book movie.<br/><br/>It's just that modern day Marvel is unfortunately nothing like Blade from 1998. The action was terrible, the acting was unforgivably bad. The dialogue was of typical modern day Marvel quality. I just can't say anything positive about the movie. sorry but I'm not sorry. I guess they use great CGI, I suppose that's both a compliment and a complaint at the same time.<br/><br/>Spare yourself the misery. Just like with Star Wars, let's stop giving these people money until they're replaced.

","This movie was awful. Disgustingly bad in so many ways that I can't explain them all. Generic story-line, very confusing scenes, showing new developments every 5 seconds, trying to keep the watcher entertained. To me it felt like the really bad try of Marvel to counter whitewashing in movies, say ""blackwashing"". I was insulted by how ridiculously it is done, mixing tribal style with african american elements. All actors could have been white anyways as it seemed so unreal, but then again, all the barbarism wouldn't quite fit. In my eyes an abominable illustration of black culture and a down to the core white and terrible movie. 1 star for the neat visuals though."

I think this movie is like Thor 3, Marvel tried little bit different thing and shows another civilization and place like we see in Thor 3 also politics is involved intensely.
Generally, I liked the cast especially chadwick boseman, Michael B.jordan Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis(I wish we could see Andy Serkis much more). Action sequences is not as efficient as like in Russo brother's movies but there is afew prominent action scenes but I think there should be much more action scenes. Hoewever, villains are most strong side of the film, there is one big plot hole why T'challa's father didn't bring Killmonger to the Wakanda or kill him too? to sum up, for me this movie an average superhero movie and definitley I woulldn't count this movie as top moives in MCU, If I would sort movies this movie could be barely in top 10 in MCU.

Pros
<ul><li>The acting was superb, every actor in the cast did a fantastic job eBay Michael B Jordan steals the show. I used to think he was just ok but he was excellent in this.</li></ul>-The fight scenes were great. On Par with Civil War but not as good as TWS.
<ul><li>Killmonger was a good villian, if they had have made his goal less 'take over the world' he would've been amazing but I understand iphis motivation. We see that he feels betrayed that he could have been raised by royalty but instead lived in poverty eventually becoming orphaned.</li><li>The comedic timing was good, it didn't feel out of place like a lot of other Marvel movies.</li></ul><br/><br/>Cons
<ul><li>The third act was so underwhelming and unsatisfying it hurt. Everything is rapped up too neatly and the final fight didn't reflect anything learnt throughout the movie, just that T'Challa is more perceptive? Strategic? Idk.</li><li>T'Challa had no arc. He started at one political view at the start of the movie and just changed it. I didn't have much investment in T'Challa.</li><li>No one cared about Zuri. We should have.</li><li>CGI looked like stretch Armstrong at some points.</li></ul>"
"MaxHuskins","8","20","53","19 February 2018"," Fresh, bold, exciting and cool!
","Due to the recent over saturation of the superhero genre, most of us have developed a fatigue to these movies by now and are tired of seeing the same old thing rehashed over and over again. 
This was my biggest concern walking into this movie, so I kept my expectations low even throughout all the praise that Black Panther has been getting. I didn't wanna see the same story for the 19th time. <br/><br/>Well, may you rest at peace because Black Panther is NOT that, it's an exciting, fresh take on all the tropes that we are so bored of. I would even go as far to say that it may be the most memorable and highest quality film Marvel has produced since Civil War. Sure, Doctor Strange was visually cool, Guardians was okay, Spiderman was better than other Spidermans and Thor was fun, but Black Panther stands out from the crowd. For the most part, it solves my biggest problem that 99% of superhero films struggle with, which is pointless and weak villains. The movie starts off with (super minor spoilers?) it's secondary villain, who is a familiar and exciting character that I really enjoy seeing on screen - Ulysses Klaue. He's fun, energetic, crazy, unpredictable and cool. But later as the movie is developing, a new brand of Marvel villain emerges, Killmonger. He has everything that modern villains lack - moral dilemma, comprehensive motivation, solid plan. You understand him and you sympathise with his reasoning, understanding why he has to do what he's doing. It's not your typical pure overpowered evil forces from outer space here to conquer for no reason. It's a human who wants to fix the world and do something right, someone who believes that they are doing good. <br/><br/>Also, I enjoyed that the conflict of the movie was scaled (for the most part) and we didn't see any ""world ending"" implications or over the top CGI laser spewing magic boss battles (that look more like a video game cutscene than a movie, I'm looking at you Justice League). Both Black Panther and Killmonger were equally matched. Nobody was overpowered. The stakes were set at the exact right level, which gives me really high hopes for the upcoming Avengers movie. I don't know if this movie necessarily will withstand the test of time but what I know for sure that I really enjoyed it. In fact, it's a great movie that could be watched as a stand-alone film outside of the MCU, that doesn't require previous knowledge of comic book lore. <br/><br/>From a cinematic standpoint, I really enjoyed that this movie mashes so many of the familiar things that you know and love and puts them in one movie and NAILS it. It doesn't feel forced but you feel the genuine love and care that was there behind scenes. You can tell that this was a movie made by people who like movies. There are moments where it feels like it could be a scene from the universes like James Bond, Fast and the Furious, Lion King, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones and a million other things and it feels good. It was an awesome and epic ride that made me feel like a kid again. <br/><br/>Other than a few cheesy jokes that felt a little bit out of place Ã  la ""hey there fellow kids"", there is really nothing to nitpick. 
I have to applaud literally every single department that's worked on this movie - the cinematography, the special effects, the set design, costumes, music, sound design, acting, etc, all of it was top notch. <br/><br/>Overal, fantastic watch that's worth going to the theatre for. 
Also, for those who are concerned that this is a liberal aimed progressive movie that's gonna shove ""social justice warrior"" things down your throat? You're just plain wrong. It doesn't feel forced at all, in fact, it felt more natural than a LOT of movies that are coming out these days.<br/><br/>P/S<br/><br/>Better than Wonder Woman, which I also enjoyed."
"ferguson-6","8","20","53","15 February 2018"," an antelope in the headlights
","Greetings again from the darkness. Adaptations of Superheroes, Comic Books, and Graphic Novels have been driving the movie theatre box office for a few years now. Where the financial success of a film was once measured in tens of millions, it's now hundreds of millions. Beyond that, these enormous productions are pressured to make political and social statements ... providing the hope of which real life leaders seem to fail. This latest from Marvel and director Ryan Coogler (CREED, FRUITVALE STATION), carries all of that plus the expectations of an entire gender and race. It's a heavy burden for a comic book character, however it seems, regardless of one's perspective, it's likely the film delivers, satisfies, and ... oh yeah ... entertains.<br/><br/>The bar has been set so high for action sequences and special effects, that we take the great for granted and only speak up on those that falter. What allows this film to take its place among the best of the genre is a combination of story depth and the payoff for showing us a world we haven't previously seen. The cultural aspects of the (mythical) African country of Wakanda are not only interesting, but the setting itself is breath-taking. An explosion of color, texture and technology blended with intriguing and multi-dimensional characters bring the film to life and draw us into this wonderland of tradition, culture and humanity.<br/><br/>It seems ridiculous to speak of a comic book film in these terms, but the number of talking points raised during its runtime are too many and too varied to discuss in this format. What we can make clear is that it's cool to watch an entire movie where people of color and women are strong, confident, and intelligent. Chadwick Boseman has played Thurgood Marshall (MARSHALL), James Brown (GET ON UP), and Jackie Robinson (42), and here he takes on a fictional icon in King T'Challa/Black Panther. He perfectly captures the pensive nature of a King balancing tradition with the needs of his people to evolve and transition. His chief adversary ""Killmonger"" is played terrifically by Michael B Jordan (CREED, FRUITVALE STATION) as a man out for revenge and power. For most movies this head to head battle would be enough ... but not this time.<br/><br/>Lupita Nyong'o (Oscar winner for 12 YEARS A SLAVE), Danai Gurira (""The Walking Dead""), and relative newcomer Letitia Wright play Nakia, Okoye, and Shuri respectively; a triumvirate of three of the strongest women you've likely ever seen on screen. Nakia is the love interest, but also carrying out her own humanitarian missions, while also proving to be beyond adequate as a soldier. Okoye is the ultimate warrior and absolutely loyal to her country, while Nakia (T'Challa's sister) is a contemporary version of James Bond's Q - the ultimate technology whiz, and one with the zippiest zingers. Any of these characters could be the basis for a standalone movie, but together they elevate this to something much more than a couple of dudes in sleek suits fighting.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman (THE HOBBIT), Daniel Kaluuya (GET OUT), Sterling K Brown (""This is Us""), Angela Bassett, and Forest Whitaker are all contributors, and Andy Serkis is a frenzied standout in an all-too-brief turn as Klaue. The strong cast delivers even in the few moments when the script lags. In fact, the only piece of this puzzle that didn't seem to fit was the traditional hand-to-hand combat to determine the next king. Why is it that a nation so advanced still relies on primitive courses of decision-making? Perhaps this is merely commentary on our society, though providing a more intellectual solution would have been in line with the rest of the story.<br/><br/>The world of Wakanda is stunning. The costumes are sleek, colorful and fascinating. The characters are multi-dimensional. The action sequences are top notch (armored rhinos!). The cinematographer is Rachel Morrison, who recently made history by being the first woman to receive an Oscar nomination for cinematography (MUDBOUND). It's these factors that allow Mr. Coogler's film to achieve the level of importance that most comic book films wouldn't dare to strive for. On top of everything, it accomplishes the one thing I demand from these type of movies ... it's quite fun to watch!"

"coreyjdenford","8","46","139","13 February 2018"," The MCU has cat-like reflexes.
","This review of Black Panther is spoiler free<br/><br/>**** (4/5)<br/><br/>WITH ONLY A few films to his name director Ryan Coogler has taken a real turn in the world of cinema, first was tough-bearing directorial debut Fruitvale Station which was only a small indie project but after that it didn't take long for his name to be on the map, it was, inevitably a few years later when he made his second feature Creed (Rocky 7) where the illigitimate son of the late Apollo Creed would take his turn in the boxing world, and finally his third and latest film Black Panther is his chance at a big budget feature. However not only black power a main symbol in his features there's only one actor who has collaborated with the director in every one of his films; Michael B. Jordan. 
 
Black Panther opens not long after the death of his father King T'Chalka, which would then conjure up his revenge in Captain America: Civil War. Here he has swapped from being a supporting player to being the main feature, he's just about to be crowned King of Wakanda, the fictional African nation which has made an occasional entry in other MCU movies. For the ceremony he has to take on a challenger in gladiator-style combat, there's African-drum music in the air and the Wakandan natives are chanting to the beat. This is an important scene, one that changes the world of cinema in an excellent way, granted on occasion there have been a few films that make a few homages to a homely place, for example 2009's Avatar had the main character going to meet other tribes and there would be different design's to their clothing. Coogler follows that same insight. Like Taika Waititi before him who paid energetic homage to his home of New Zealand by adding his Antipodean style humour in Thor: Ragnarok, here Coogler is the polar opposite, he swaps the humour for the colour of the country and their natives who dress in African-style colours from bright reds, through yellows to the bright greens, even through the Africani accessories. Coogler's attention to the detail is exquisite. <br/><br/>With that in mind, it's also an important film one that shows how much 21st century has changed and you could argue that it's for the better. After becoming king, T'challa (Chadwick Boseman) has to face his biggest challenge, to protect his country against the invasion of a former soldier with a mysterious past Jordan's Erik Killmonger (which sounds like a gaming profile), who wants to overthrow the king. So that's your average Marvel movie storytelling right there. However, Coogler doesn't make it the average Marvel film apart from his exquisite hand in the Africani detail, it's perhaps the most visually stunning comic-book movie, and the Panther's suit changing colour, the sand-like holograms and the amazing cityscape which shines thanks to Rachel Morrison's gorgeous cinematography. 
 
There's so much good in Black Panther, excellent action, stunning visuals, gorgeous cinematography and a director who pays an energetic homage to Africa, but the real standing point here is the female characters, from Danai Gurira, through Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o to T'challa's mother played by Angela Bassett. Who all put in excellent performances along with another standout performance by recent award's darling Daniel Kaluuya. Boseman and Jordan are excellent too, but here they're made into supporting players by these brilliant performers. In short, Coogler's go at the MCU and his third feature is a brilliant entry to his growing filmography one that takes an important scratch in cinema.
 
VERDICT Like Waititi before him Coogler pays energetic homage to his past life in the MCU's latest super extravaganza."

"Thekeybaldemasterrises","8","23","63","17 February 2018"," Went in expecting a decent action movie, got so much more than that.
","Marvel always surprises me when I think they've run out of steam. Black Panther is what the 18th movie they've done? There seems to be no sign of them slowing down anytime soon, and for good reason. With the industry scrambling to find the next big cinematic universe/comic book franchise, there will never be another like what Marvel Studios has accomplished. We had Iron Man all the way back in 2008 and I never would've thought 10 years from then we'd be watching a Black Panther movie. I wasn't expecting much going into it, I figured it would be a decent action movie with a pretty familiar plot. In some ways it was, but in some ways it actually wasn't. These movies tend to fall under a pretty general third act with hero vs villain so I wasn't too thrilled by that part, but at least the action was well done so I let it slide. If anyone does anything like Fan4stick or Man of Steel ever again I'll walk out before it's even over. What Black Panther really shines in is it's world building through breaking the cultural barrier, I wondered going in how they were going to address the fact that Wakanda was this technological utopia when there are so many third world countries barely staying together. The answers they gave were satisfying at least for a comic book movie. You have a strong villain who's fueled with this hatred against the world for how they've treated African people and how Wakanda in has stood to the side all these years. Trying to not get involved of the obstacles African people are constantly struggling with all over the world. It's doing a lot right and I'm glad they took the time to tell a meaningful story that doesn't necessarily force a bridge into more movies, but rather contribute to the constant evolving world. By the end the characters make a decision that promises some interesting directions and possibilities and I'm genuinely curious to see where they could take it. Overall this movie was pretty satisfying. Great direction, performances, and plenty of popcorn action for a good time. If you enjoy these movies, obviously go see it, If you don't then I guess don't? I'm a bit surprised people are accusing positive reviews of being afraid to express their true opinions because they don't wanna come off as racist or offensive against SJW. But then again this is the internet so who am I kidding. We live in a day and age where people are looking to stand out online trying to look hip by saying the movie sucks because it's boring and what not. If you're going to critique something actually put some effort into it. Strip away the visuals and performances, then you got a pretty generic superhero story I agree, but what matters is the execution and effort they put into it. These movies are not Citizen Kane they're popcorn movies but they do a decent job that actually deserves the praise. There's a line T'chaka has in here about not building barriers but opening them and how we have to look after one another like we're a single tribe, humanity. The haters of Black Panther know I'm telling the truth and are going to downvote this review because they don't like people supporting Disney and their ""SJW agendas"". Well all I gotta say is you're not fooling anyone as long as you put money down for that ticket, I'll see you at Infinity War!"

I had a few questions about how having a better metal makes them basically a futuristic sci fi society (stronger metal doesn't automatically equal flying cars, that's not how science works), but it made for a visually spectacular film. It suffers from the same syndrome as Asgard where for some reason their army forgoes ranged weapons in order to use amped up swords (despite being futuristic) oh well.

I wanted to like it, I really did, but it's just kind of pathetic. The movie keeps harping on the ideas that Africa would somehow be a world leader, if not for the evil white colonialists, as if anyone in their right mind actually believes that. The villain makes comments about how everything was stolen from Africa by a white women's ""ancestors"". The uncle says how the black people of planet earth are ""unfairly"" policed and incarcerated..i.e. ""Dundu Nuffin"". The black sister calls the white CIA agent a ""colonizer"", as if he is somehow responsible for the actions of people hundreds, if not thousands, of years before he was born. The most hypocritical line in the movie then follows, when the wife of Black Panther tells him ""you can't let your fathers mistakes define who you are""...yet this whole movie tries to define all of the white characters as ""oppressors"" and ""colonizers"", because of what their ancestors supposedly did. So why doesn't Wakanda use their special mineral to take over the world? Because they are peaceful and respectful people, and it's not their way....as if Africa is not a war torn continent that has been murdering and enslaving it's own people for the entirety of written history.

Unfortunately, one of the villains from the backstory isn't really quite Disney, so the film mixes a Bond lack of sentimentality at the beginning before going full Lion King at the end. The political points do hit home properly, but don't stay with you. <br/><br/>The design and look of the film was as spectacular as sold, and mostly everything makes sense. It is this that will keep Black Panther going. There was a certain elan, which is missing from many other Marvel works. The afrofuturism provides an ever present thematic anchor.<br/><br/>The film follows the 'first in franschise' template that states you must see lots of Wakanda and its denizens. Yet when it is slightly mysterious it is much better. Consequenly too much time is spent with the royal family and it feels like Thor in Asgard. The film was strongest away from there.<br/><br/>At the end you can feel that this film was carefully guided down a safe path to protect it, but it could have done with less of that. Character development suffered because the Avengers gets all the good dialogue work. The final fight was the usual weakly choreographed fudge, a decades old format now. And the Black Panther is as strong in his mask as he is lightweight without it."

Up until now Marvel has taken the high road with this but they have dipped their toe into the politically correct cesspool that is losing Hollyweird millions of fans and dollars.

","This is my first ever movie review which in my mind justifies my rating! I will start off with all the things I liked about the movie and then explain why I feel like I am overrating it. <br/><br/>Hands down my favorite ingredient is the sci-fi. I loved how the rare earth metal was weaved into the story and allowed amazing technological innovations. <br/><br/>The costumes are excellent!<br/><br/>The dialogue is excellent, contemporary, serious, witty, and funny.<br/><br/>The cause of the superhero's action and emergence is compelling, believable, and easily relatable.<br/><br/>Now the negative. I could easily have given this a 4-5 rating. I literally dozed off several times at some of the more redundant parts of the movie. It was so predictable where this was going and it just dragged on and on and on. Even tho I liked the dialogue a lot, I want there to be a point to it. The story telling left no drama or suspense for what I should expect. <br/><br/>The theme of a hidden technological city was tragically ignored after the opening few scenes. It felt like the movie abandoned the concept of any sort of interaction between this city and the outside world. I get that that was kind of the moral point of the movie, but the point was almost completely missed by me until the after credit scene. <br/><br/>The beginning and endings were memorable to me, but the entire struggle between the villain and hero left so much to be desired. I was just extremely bored with the plot. I felt like I was sitting around for the entire movie waiting for a spark to ignite my imagination. <br/><br/>I give it 5 based on the pure review and a couple of extra stars for the sci-fi potential and the coolness factor. <br/><br/>This movie definitely deserves a sequel and it might be one of the rare instances where the sequel is better than the original, that is if the next one can have the same dialogue concepts, the same sci-fi potential, and the same cool looking costumes!<br/><br/>Conclusion, its worth watching because it has so much potential to be an epic tale. It might seem boring because too much time was spent on empty plot details and not enough time on building out relationships between characters."
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","10","20","55","19 February 2018"," I personally loved this movie! Lovely, vibrant addition to the MCU.
","After nearly two years since Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther leaps onto the scene and gets his own movie; and what a great surprise this movie was for me.
Marvel's movies have gotten a little derivative for some, and I think Black Panther is something of a multicultural response to that criticism: the movie evokes The Lion King, Skyfall, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Thor and Wonder Woman while creating an identity of its own; the panther is no Batman clone I can assure you of that.<br/><br/>Ryan Coogler writes, co-produces and directs the film with surprising ease and boy this man knows how to infuse style into franchised movies; we've got the first blaxploitation superhero movie of the age, and it has A LOT to say about war, entitlement, morality, political (& cultural) unity and feminism. This movie is a broadly appealing triumph of genre filmmaking with culturally distinct aesthetics that are otherwise outside the typical Western mainstream. African-American filmmaking got a tonne of coverage in the 70s, and it looks like that with the likes of Black Panther and Get Out, filmmaking made by, and centered around, black people is making a long overdue comeback into the modern mainstream. With Hollywood stars like Forest Whitaker and Lupita Nyong'o gracing Black Panther it's amazing that there are directors like Coogler are at long-last getting into the blockbuster scene.<br/><br/>I love this film; it's a global semi-political-conspiracy thriller that takes place in Africa, South Korea and the United States and utilises those locations as beautifully as any of the very best James Bond films.<br/><br/>Black Panther is a must-see of the highest order, and good job on MARVEL for making all of this possible!"

"jpatrick-68632","4","7","15","20 February 2018"," Melanistic Leopard
","We toddled off to see BLACK PANTHER and I renewed my Hoyts Seniors card and got in for nothing! Yay me! 
And it was worth every cent too.<br/><br/>The Black Panther is the newly minted king of Wakanda, a super-dooper advanced country hidden in Africa like skull Island is hidden in the Pacific but there's no giant ape although there are ginormous CGI armoured rhinoceroses but more on them later.<br/><br/>A black panther is the melanistic color variant of any big cat species but in this case, it being Africa, izza Leopard! So to remove any reference to colour (although the educated will know that black isn't actually a colour) King T'Challa could have been non-judgementally called 'Melanistic Leopard' but that doesn't, I suppose, have the same ring to it. <br/><br/>Wakanda has heaps and heaps of a metal that I can't remember the name of but it's terribly, terribly useful and rare and it is the reason that they are so advanced. Aliens might've given it to them. Dunno. Can't remember that either. They also have some purple plants that give the king his Melanistic Leopard powers and this is just what the Dockers need. Except Nat Fyfe. He doesn't need it.<br/><br/>There are also some fierce warrior chicks who are like Amazons but aren't from an island. They scowl (a lot!) and are the King's special bodyguards. But not like Colonel Gaddafi's bodyguards, at least I don't think so. There is a lovable sidekick who is a CIA operative and a nasty villain who is a Yarpie (obviously!)<br/><br/>King T'Challa's father has just died and this sets the scene for the sort of conflict that is central to any Marvel movie. Yes, there is another claimant to the throne who appears and he has hundreds and hundreds of what appear to be little boils, each of which represent someone he killed. I think. Who they were or why they were killed I cannot recall, but he's from America, so anyone really.<br/><br/>His father was killed by T'Challa's father so there's bad blood aplenty. T'Challa has a sister who is terribly good at inventing things like new Black Panther suits sort of like Tony Stark except she doesn't get to wear 'em and she's a chick..<br/><br/>The new claimant wants to take over the world and right centuries of wrongs done to Africans and their descendants worldwide and violence is his weapon combined with other weapons made out of terribly, terribly useful and rare metal. And he wants to do it NOW! King T'Challa favours a more measured approach to world domination using a creeping goodness and mercy and understanding strategy. No-one is stepping up to redress the wrongs done to Australian Aboriginals, or first nations folk from other, more heavily armed, countries.<br/><br/>In the finest tradition of Marvel there is a really big battle between the two forces, and the usurper has the CG ginormous rhinoceroses who cut a swathe though King T'Challa's forces but are tamed by someone that they used to know and she gets her face licked. They, the CG armour clad rhinos, don't look very real. Although I've never seen a real ginormous armoured rhinoceros so I might be judging them unfairly. <br/><br/>In my view, the battle scene would've been heaps better if there had been a contingent of Welsh infantry singing 'Men of Harlech'. I suppose some will ponder upon who was good, and who was evil, or were either of them good or evil or on infinite variations of the two. But I didn't.<br/><br/>Is it a parable? Does King T'Challa represent Martin Luther King? Does usurper-guy represent Malcolm X? Or the prophet Mohammed? Dunno. <br/><br/>Is it any good?
Look. I may not have been part of the target demographic. Lots of clever and self important reviewers have compared it, favourably, to bees-knees. Me? Not so much. It's better'n Interstellar, but so is having an eyeball removed with a spoon that has just been licked by, say, Jabba the Hutt.<br/><br/>A bit dull."

"theresamansweto","5","7","15","17 February 2018"," Really hyped but did it meet expectations?
","Look, I came to this movie with excitment, and with an open mind. I didn't even watch the trailer for the movie, the movie got so much hype and good reviews from pplaces like Rotten Tomatoes at 98% making it the highest scoring superhero movie and Imdb with a 7.8 rating. People were saying best superhero movie ever, Michael B Jordans villain was the best villian in movie history, the villian was better than Heath Ledgers Joker, did you read that, b-e-t-t-e-r than Heath Ledgers Joker, okay now you've crossed the line. Michael B Jordans preformance as the villian was good, but in no way does it stand next to The Joker.<br/><br/>Plot: The plot for this movie was set up in a good way, it reminded me of The Lion King, which I think was better than Black Panther. Except it got boring, I never have nearly fell asleep in a movie, even in the action scenes. It got pretty boring and really, really futeristic. It got boring because of a lot of talking but I didn't really care about characters dying, Sometimes I didn't even get the big deal about someone dying. <br/><br/>Actors: I have to give props to the actors in the movie, most of all Andy Serkis, who is usually a monkey actor for Planet Of The Apes, and King Kong. I am glad Andy got a chance to show his other acting skills to the world even though he is already a brilliant actor and very underrated. Overall Michael B Jordan, Chadwick Boseman and the lady supporting actors like Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira were really good as well.<br/><br/>Editing and CGI: There was a lot of CGI in this movie for obvious reasons and mostly because the movie is so futeristic with extreme technology and flying things and things like that. Other places included scenery and landscapes like waterfalls and other nature were very good and they nailed that.<br/><br/>Feedback: To be raw this isn't the superhero movie I was looking for. This wasn't anything like Spiderman Homecoming or other Marvel movies, which it doesn't have to be exactly like other movies it's just they coulld have made this movie a lot more intriguing and interesting. The hype really wasn't needed for this movie but it was mostly the African American people really excited about a new Black superhero, which I understand because if they made a movie surrounding my country people will get really excited to because pretty much all movies are based in America because America always gets the spotlight. But It was great to finally have a Black superhero for a change instead of having a predominatly white American superheros, and It's great that they are spreading superheros to other areas around the globe and I hope they continue to do that for places like Europe, Australia and other places around the world. But saying the movie is a really good film because it is a Black Superhero isn't the way to judge how good a movie is. This movie got boring for me and that is just my opinion but it seems a lot of other people agree as well. It was over hyped, huge budget, but really boring and nearly put me to sleep. I give Black Panther a 5.5/10, The best part was Andy Serkis's character."
"luzm88","10","9","21","20 February 2018"," Subtle and direct punches
","I have had the privilege to watch this movie twice this past weekend. The second time was in Baldwin Park, where I was surrounded by my fellow people of color. It was such a wonderful experience both times. <br/><br/>The start of the movie is a bit jarring and rushed, but I am grateful that they included the mythology so early. All the main characters were amazing. Each relationship seemed solid and unique. The personalities felt real. The villains, what can I say? Klaue was a bit on the ridiculous side, serving as a comic relief almost. Still, his point of view added to the richness of the film. Being that ""those savages"" (Wakandians) did not deserve the riches that they possessed. There was no real reason given as to why he felt this way, but perhaps the point was to leave the reasons open enough for all the various reasons people feel entitled to another's things. <br/><br/>Killmonger, what can I say about him? I felt for him. He was a tough villain to dislike, because, although his methodology/execution is very very flawed, his points are so very valid. Every now and then he would say a bit a dialogue which would cut deep into current issues. His last lines, which I believe went something along the lines of this: ""Just bury me in the ocean with my ancestors who jumped ship, because they knew that death was better than bondage"". Wow.....<br/><br/>Again, Killmonger's actions were not redeemable, he became as much a monster as those he sought to destroy. He was so blinded by pain, anger, and rage, that he drew pleasure in the idea of one day giving it all back to a world so flawed that would subject a child to horrors and violence. <br/><br/>No movie is perfect. In my opinion, some character's motivations were a bit exaggerated, (W'Kabi losing loyalty to his friend and going against his love because he was upset that his friend did not immediately succeed in delivering Klaue and Killmonger happened to). Some the effects were also questionable. But again, no movie is perfect.<br/><br/>Shout out to M'Baku. Leader of the Jabari and King of sass. Yes, I'm done now."
"Troy_Campbell","6","9","21","18 February 2018"," Politically relevant, but ultimately mid-tier Marvel.
","The hype surrounding Marvel's newest cinematic instalment was stratospheric. A predominantly African-American cast and crew generated the initial publicity, then a knockout trailer turned that buzz into genuine excitement. Perhaps with such high expectations it was always going to be difficult for writer-director Ryan Coogler to deliver; the timely political themes, big-budget blockbuster requirements and Marvel connectivity all vying for his attention. Let's get the bad news out of the way: the action is underwhelming. There are a few decent sequences-a casino showdown boasts an ambitious unbroken tracking shot, a ritualistic cliff-side clash between two major characters is brutal-however, the set pieces largely leave a lot to be desired. Majority of the action is a blur of choppy editing and dimly lit cinematography, making it hard to appreciate both the choreography and geography of the fighting, whilst the finale is a disappointingly banal battle featuring, wait for it, CGI rhinos. Where this movie thrives though, is in its story and characters. Undoubtedly the MCU's most politically relevant instalment, the central plot revolves around oppression, equality, power-sharing and class, all tied up into a potent narrative that gives its characters room to breathe and grow. As the eponymous hero from Wakanda, Chadwick Boseman is endearing as a confident but conflicted King T'Challa, while his opposing force Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) is riveting as an unstoppable tornado of fury and revenge. Yet this film also gives us three of the strongest female characters of the franchise: Lupita Nyong'o as royal spy Nakia, Danai Gurira as fierce warrior Okoye, and Letitia Wright as exuberant tech-wizard Shuri. More often than not it's this trio who make the sound decisions, save the hero and kick some serious arse. Credit to Coogler and his crew for successfully weaving in so much African culture too. The stunning production design and costuming combines traditional African symbology with the high-tech world, whilst the score is a low-key fusion of hip-hop, customary African tunes and standard orchestral overtones. Its social and political commentary gives Black Panther a pertinence and edge most MCU flicks don't have, but as an action blockbuster it's merely mid-tier Marvel."

It was very pleasing to see that Freeman get a more deep role through the movie than just a short cameo. Andy Serkis made Klaw crazy and unpredictable, and a very good second villain for the movie. <br/><br/>But one of the most terrific things in the movie is the representation of Wakanda. It looks and feels alive. Every shot is an art. Accompanied by the soundtrack it increase the richness of Wakanda and its mythology.<br/><br/>The movie only flaw is that it doesn't have much of a turning points. It's pretty straight forward. Maybe there are one or two, but not on the level, let say of Civil War or Thor Ragnarok. However this doesn't hinder the great story of the movie and its narrative. There is some noticeable at the 3rd act, but it's doesn't take you away from the action in any way.<br/><br/>
Black Panther is another solid entry for the MCU. It feels different and for the most of it's parts self contained(for a 18th MCU movie). We can hope to see the greatness of T'Challa yet again in Infinity War."

","The pinned under the rubbles in Homecoming, Logan and Watchmen entire movie.
Those were emotional, but didn't make me cry.
But the relationship between T'Challa and Erik with their respective father made me cry.<br/><br/>Among superhero movies I've watched, this is the best so far<br/><br/>The score for the reviews and ratings for this movie is kinda funky.
Just like Get Out, there are people that rated this too high or too low due to racial issue.
I say let's put that aside and judge this movie for it's quality as a movie.
Even the final message expressed by this movie, as said by T'Challa, is to build bridges to connect, help, and work together with everyone.<br/><br/>But I digress,
Worthy of it's title as the best superhero movie so far (according to me), the actions, visual effects, and scale were amazing.
The music matches the tone of the scenes and overall enjoyable.<br/><br/>The enemies are not ""faceless"" like Ultron's robots, Avenger's aliens, Suicide Squad's and Justice League's Dumb Whatever-Those-Things are, and this is my favorite aspect of the movie, actual enemies with personalities and ideas.<br/><br/>The only ""flaws"" (not really but) to me are :
1. The villains were as interesting as Loki, but they were all dead. Pity.
2. Despite being a superhero movie, not much ""superheroing"" done. Well, this is the internal strife part so understandable.<br/><br/>In conclusion : Watch it"

"mb1456","7","5","10","19 February 2018"," Less of the Panther, More of His Toys...
","I had a huge expectation about this solo Black Panther movie after whatever little of him in Captain America - Civil War movie left me very impressed. I mean, that movie was the first time I got introduced to the Black Panther character and I was instantly bowled by his black suit, mask and how he fights(no guns or fancy gadgets, just his claws & kicks..). But with this solo venture, I didn't get to see him in a pure fight except for the intro encounter with some rogues in a forest. The action in the rest of the movie is more about his fancy gadgets, Spiderman like jumps or other visual effects show off. When I entered the theatre, Black Panther was my fav Marvel character. When I left, it ceased to be. That tells it all. They made him like the James Bond or the Iron Man of Wakanda with all the latest gadgets to save his a**! Black Panther's USP, I feel, is his hand to hand combats, kicks and ofcourse that suit that can take on anything earthly atleast. Making him fly around like Spiderman or use toys makes him no different from other Marvel or DC super heroes and one loses interest eventually.<br/><br/>The movie is otherwise a decent entertainer especially the first half. There are lot of hilarious moments as well especially among the Panther and his sister Shuri or from the hugely built Mbaku, the chief of another tribe whom Panther fights for the throne. Among the performances, Chadwick Boseman fits into the Panther role very well. Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia, Panther's love is breathtakingly beautiful. Martin Freeman also makes his presence felt but somehow I think these kinda roles don't suit him at all or explore his potential the way the Hobbit did. My fav performance among the cast is from the brilliant Andy Serkis as the ruthless trader Ulysses Klaue. It's refreshing to see him perform purely as an actor for a movie than just prance around in a body suit. And finally the climax...well, I didn't stay back for the post credit scenes but it wouldn't have made me any less disappointed. Really the story could have done less with the technology in Wakanda or the glory of metal vibranium and more about the man T'Challa(the Black Panther), some realistic action and his emotional struggles to save his family or the world.<br/><br/>Verdict - a nice entertainer but next time let the Panther hunt without his toys!"
"dj-lord","7","5","10","18 February 2018"," Solid 7 - enjoyed it but it's not as good as the critics say!
","First off, really enjoyed it and so did my little boy (12). There were some great characters fleshed out really well with a great cast, plenty of standard comic book action and some funny banter/quips between characters which never felt out of place (T'Challa and his sisters banter is really enjoyable).<br/><br/>Even though there's a lot of technology on show the films never feels too ""techie"" and, at it's heart, it keeps grounded and true to it's tribal kingdom roots. The main arc T'Challa character arc of taking on the Black Panther/King mantel, the tribes and storyline around that is really well done.<br/><br/>Outside that there are some regulation car chases, shoot-outs, fights, etc which are pretty standard Marvel fare and nothing great. They look good (obviously) but are a little OTT and distracting from the well acted, grounded plotlines. There's also the annoyance of the overacting, ham-master himself Andy Serkis.<br/><br/>All-in-all, it's a very solid comic book movie with some great sections (see above re: grounded, realistic story bits) and some decent standard Marvel schlock. Better than most Marvel movies it's fare to say, and yes it does have a great cast too!<br/><br/>Definitely worth watching but not, as some have said, a 97% hit or as good as the critics are trying to have you believe (I assume that's more a case of pushing it's first black superhero thing - Blade might not have been the first but it wasn't that long ago, was it!?!?)"
"mbkalkan","7","5","10","18 February 2018"," Good but much overrated
","Being an avid book reader, I have watched all but 2 or 3 comic book adaptations since the late 1970s. I have witnessed the change in tone and approach, as well as the the whole world-building process take root in the recent adaptations as the times inevitably changed. What Marvel has done so far is much more commendable than DC, and many examples of Marvel movies of the last 10 years are the living proof of that. However, not all of these adaptations are on par with what we may get to call all-time greats, and I am afraid -despite all the high grades given to the movie by critics- Black Panther is one of them. <br/><br/>Black Panther actually happens to be one of my favorite characters along with Thor, a few X-men and Green Lantern. Time and again, I have read it with utter joy and fulfillment, and have always looked forward to the next issue. Therefore, this movie was one which I looked forward to with extreme enthusiasm. And maybe it was this same enthusiasm that ruined the movie for me, but I sincerely doubt it. <br/><br/>So, as to how I see the movie:<br/><br/>OK, so the casting is right on target, no quarrels there. And so are the visual effects and the setting of the story. However, the story is somewhat shallow, and needlessly comedic at places where it shouldn't be.<br/><br/>Marvel (Disney) has lately started to follow a certain pattern of writing scripts, just like in the Bond movies. A hero, a romantic interest, a villain, a side-kick (or someone who takes on the role of Q from those Bond movies), a moral dilemma... and we are set. This one here is no different, only -as I have said before- somewhat shallow. Also, there happens to be more than one coincidental occurrence which make the story a lot less believable, if you care about those things. All of a sudden, an unexpected piece falls into place, a miraculous twist happens, someone appears out of thin air, and voila... all is well.<br/><br/>The movie that could have delivered so much more at us, ends up delivering a script which can be summarized in just 2 sentences, and a story full of plot holes.<br/><br/>So, how come such a movie garner so much praise, and such high marks? I dunno, honestly, but I have a theory. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I feel like it would be safe to say that this movie was sort of a hype created to promote a black super hero in these trying times and during the re-emergence of needless and disturbing racial tendencies. It was during these times the movie was shot and as such promoted to emphasize equality and fairness among all people. Which is all good and fine, but it still could have done that with a stronger script, with a more coherent and fuller story. The fact that it gets so many high notes is not because of the film that it is, but because of the film it was intended to be. At least, this is my take on the movie, and how the film was reviewed so highly.<br/><br/>I just hope the next installment in the Black Panther saga delivers more, just like the Winter Soldier delivered after the first Captain America adaptation."
"achyutaghosh","10","15","41","18 February 2018"," Marvel-lous
","When the going gets tough, the tough gets going.<br/><br/>Not that in the comic book film universe, the going has got tough for Marvel due to DC Comics. We all know how Justice League ended up. The going has got tough for Marvel because of Marvel itself. Civil War and Thor: Ragnarok in their own way set the new gold standards. Also, as new characters enter the MCU, the treatment needs to change too. A comic book blockbuster today needs to be more than just a comic book blockbuster- and that is what makes Black Panther great. With gracious heroes, quipping villains, rocking car chases and fantastic weapons, it is an out and out enjoyable comic book blockbuster for sure. Elements of espionage sagas with homage to 007 Bond, paired with Afro futurist themes along with some Shakespearean twists gives the movie it's own flavor. <br/><br/>Marvel movies are increasingly getting interlinked, so for someone who has missed Civil War, there is a lot to catch up. For someone who hasn't, we jump straight into Black Panther roots and origins. <br/><br/>""Ulysses Klaue: Tell me something. What do you know about Wakanda?
Everett K. Ross: It's a Third-World country. Textiles, shepherds, cool outfits.
Ulysses Klaue: All a front. Explorers have searched for it, called it ""El Dorado"". They looked for it in South America, but it was in Africa the whole time. I'm the only one who's seen it, and made it out alive.""<br/><br/>Welcome to Wakanda- blessed with mountains of vibranium, it is the most advanced society in the world. Fearful of the world's reaction to it's vibranium reserves, its culture and people, for centuries Wakanda has hidden it's true progress from the rest of the world. So while the motto is not ""America First"", but it is ""Wakanda Forever"".<br/><br/>While T'Ã‡halla wants to stay the path, there are others who feel Wakanda should share it's success with the rest of Africa, who have been brutalized by invasion, exploitation and colonization. <br/><br/>""To be or not to be the savior of the oppressed world"" - this Shakespearean choice for the characters forms the crux of the story. <br/><br/>The hunt for Ulysses Klaue sets in motion the plans of Erik Killmonger- an American mercenary wronged in the past by the Wakandan royal family, and scarred by his experiences in the real world. T'Challa will need to draw up on every ounce of strength, and all the friends he has to save Wakanda. <br/><br/>Director Ryan Coogler is coming off Creed, and he delivers here too by crafting a movie that isn't about fighting gods and robots, or chasing aliens, but more about the rights to privilege. In Erik Killmonger, he has created a villain to whom at least half the audience will agree too. Wakandans have thrived while the rest of Africa has burned. Killmonger has a point. <br/><br/>He has also assembled the finest set of black actors working today- Chadwick Boseman plays Black Panther with pathos, Lupita Nyong'o exudes radiance as Nakia, a covert agent, Michael B. Jordan plays Killmonger with feral intensity, Forest Whitaker plays Zuri, the royal shaman while Angela Bassett plays Ramona, the queen mother. The standout characters though are Shuri, played by Letitia Wright, and Okoyo, played by Danai Gurira. Said to be smarter than Tony Stark, Shuri is the Q to T'Challa's Bond, and goes about her role with vibrancy and style. Okoyo is the badass leader of T'Challa's bodyguards, stars in the action sequences and also delivers some of the funniest lines. And I especially loved Andy Serkis in front of the camera as a maniacal Klaue! <br/><br/>Coogler has really soaked up the culture of the continent and let his imagination run wild. Wakanda is a riot of colors, steeped in spirituality and culture and because it was undisturbed by colonization - also a technological marvel. Is this what Africa could have been?<br/><br/>Bottomline- Black Panther is not only a fun movie, it is also a very impactful movie. Marvel getting marvelous, really!

","I'm not going to lie. I went into this movie totally expecting it to suck.

I first saw the panther appear in Captain America Civil war and I thought the hero was meh.. I jumped to the conclusion Black Panther is only getting his on movie because Marvel studios are trying to appear more inclusive and progressive and all that PC stuff lol. I couldn't be more wrong. They actually had a plan for this hero. Great back story, Fantastic visuals, great acting, totally hilarious, moving and poignant in parts, thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I really wasn't expecting the film to be this good. It felt like a cross between Coming to America and Thor. Go watch this film and I promise you wont be disappointed.

"jrblunt-485-275453","10","32","101","18 February 2018"," Politically Charged and Highly Entertaining!
","I am very happy that director Ryan Coogler does not hide his politics in this movie. ""Black Panther"" celebrates African culture, Pan-Africanism, and Black Power with stunning visuals and excellent fight scenes. I especially enjoyed seeing African-American women portrayed as highly intelligent and strong. Almost anyone who loved the female warriors in ""Wonder Woman"" will really enjoy the fierce African-American female warriors in this film. I also like that the film does not reduce the fictional Wakanda to an African utopia. ""Black Panther"" shows intertribal conflict and violence.<br/><br/>Overall, Black Panther is a highly entertaining and somewhat politically ""woke"" film. I do not know if typical Marvel comic books fans will appreciate the movie's very visible political agenda. I do know that the movie has broken box office records and that Hollywood executives worship profits. ""Black Panther"" appears to become a highly profitable venture for Disney. Perhaps this movie's success will prompt Disney to make and distribute more movies that feature African-Americans and other people of color as superheroes. ""Black Panther"" demonstrates that highly political comic book adaptations can be very profitable. I think that is a very good thing."
"AlericTX","10","16","45","19 February 2018"," A movie that lives up to its hype
","Its not often a movie lives up to its hype. Black Panther does. It may even exceed its hype. It certainly surpassed my expectations.<br/><br/>For anyone complaining about the movies ""politics"" - How do you tell a story about a king and not have politics enter into it? There are three possibilities. 1) The complainers have never seen another Marvel Movie. 2) They aren't perceptive enough to recognize politics in most movies or 3) their racism is showing.<br/><br/>This was the best superhero movie I've seen and I've seen almost all of them. It had an origin story with roots that run deep into a rich mythology. It wove in a contemporary and relevant theme and the players, hero and villain alike were human in the best and worst ways.<br/><br/>The writing was solid and thoughtful. Superhero movies so often fall to employing A deus ex machina in the end or otherwise insult the audiences' intelligence. Black Panther did neither. It told a solid story with good action and left you with a sense of hope in the end. <br/><br/>Thoroughly enjoyable. I hope to see it in the theater again.

","This is a solid superhero movie. It's entertaining all the way through, with action, humor, plot, character, and most of all great science fiction futuristic world-building using various African cultures which remained identifiable and individual in their dress, music, etc. while participating in a super-modern society. I loved the African music. If I had been watching this at home instead of in a theater I would have gotten up and danced. In think the animals were CGI but I liked them anyway. I would have liked to see more of them. I hope there will be a battle rhino sequence in Infinity War. I liked that the people of Wakanda are openly pagan, worshippers of Bast, the Egyptian cat goddess, and I would have liked to see more about that, too. I would have liked to see more of a lot of the world-building elements of Wakanda, in fact, and I hope there is more in Black Panther 2. And if that's not already in development, get on that, Hollywood. Next time, more cats, please. <br/><br/>The hero<br/><br/>I like that this superhero has a completely different reason for wearing a mask and superhero suit than the standard superhero. Black Panther is not trying to hide his identity. He is more identifiable as the King of Wakanda when he's in the suit than when he's not. He wears a mask because the Panther mask is his crown. It's part of his culture, rooted in African customs around ritual masks. There's even a part of the movie where African ritual masks in a museum are glossed with their ages and cultures of origin. <br/><br/>It might be a little odd for an ultramodern society with really advanced science to still pick their leaders through ritual combat, but it definitely worked as a plot device and an excuse for action and for showing ritual and having great ritual dress and songs. This is not the only story where an advanced society still does that; it's one of the fundamental plot elements of the Pride of Chanur series too. That's about lions, though, which actually do have pride males that challenge for dominance of a pride. Panthers don't actually live in packs like that. Oh, well, that's a really minor quibble. I could say more about T'Challa but I don't think I could come up with anything else that would be original, that other reviewers haven't already said, so I'll just say I am looking forward to seeing him again soon in Infinity War where I expect he will be working with Capt. America (and according to the second after credit scene-- spoiler alert! With Bucky / Winter Soldier, too.) <br/><br/>The villain<br/><br/>I like that they gave us a ""villian"" so relatable that a lot of people think Killmonger is the hero. His view that Wakanda should help the less fortunate black people of the world is a view shared by Black Panther's love interest, and (spoiler alert!) Black Panther softens his stance in this area at the end of the movie. (There's another villain who is more villainous, Klaue the arms dealer, but he's a small-timer whose corpse Killmonger stands on, on his way to the top of the heap.) I also liked that Killmonger only remained true to his principles until he actually got power, and then basically turned into a colonizer, with his ""sun never sets"" line that echoes the famous line about the British Empire. This not only showed that Killmonger was in fact the bad guy in this story but also is true to human nature in that way that, as they say, power corrupts. <br/><br/>On the Nature of Good and Evil<br/><br/>One expects a superhero movie to have its good guys all good and its bad guys all bad, and this one breaks that expectation in many ways. Not only is the main villain not really evil, but the same characteristic is present in some of the good guys and bad guys. For example, the first scene that shows Killmonger is supposed to be a bad guy is when he is willing to kill his lover to achieve his goal, which he of course believes is a noble goal. Later, the general of the Doras displays this exact same characteristic, willing to kill her lover for Wakanda in their civil war, and she is one of the good guys. This makes these characters very human, in that no one is all good or all evil. <br/><br/>Bottom line: Good movie, see it."

","Honestly don't have any idea where the hate is coming from or how anyone can bypass all the glory that this movie offers. This movie was spectacular. Saw it 2x and it's even better the 2nd viewing. I see a lot of average movie going fan boys looking for a certain atmosphere that very familiar in the other marvel movies and yet are unaware that this film breaks all of that with food reason. After seeing some of the mixed reviews it's VERY CLEAR that these so called Marvel fans don't read comics as much as they say. Particularly with Black Panther. This movie does does no set ups for sequels or other movies. (Unless u wait for end credits) It strictly holds its own as a solo superhero movie. And of course it speaks to black audiences like no other before it. So obviously NOT EVERYONE will relate to the allegorical messages. However, unless you've been living under a rock, those same messages SHOULD help you understand the perspectives. It's not convoluted nor complex in it's narrative. And I must say.....THE.....BEST....VILLAIN.....EVER. Yes Loki can take a seat. Kilmonger was vicious, dangerous and........relatable. As well as the rest of the cast. Phenomenal job with everyone.

"owensbrendon","10","8","19","21 February 2018"," Light spoilers no important details. Not as preachy as I feared.
","A lot of the bad reviews say that the movie doesn't have enough action. I have to disagree with all I have on that. It is action packed and not too preachy. Micheal b Jordan's character, killmonger was the preachy one and he was the bad guy for a reason. The good guys, black Panther and friends where against the anger that killmonger had. The movie is not anti-white, I would not even say it was pro-black. The movie was just about a fictional African country with resources far beyond any other place on Earth. It is action packed and semi-realistic. All of the bad reviews say that it was like the Lion king. I saw that too, but what you have to realize is that these common things come from different parts of African folklore and a mixture of inspirations. Plus, the lion king was awesome. I am not going to act like I dressed up in a dashiki to see this movie or that I suddenly was really proud of my heritage or anything. THE MOVIE WAS GOOD, not life changing, remember that. Ignore whatever preconceived notions you have going in to the movie theater. The fact of the matter is this is something different and it is really hyped up. Go in expecting everything that you see from the bad reviews and you will be very very happy with the movie. Anyway, the plot was great, and if you like games like battlefront or halo, you will love this movie. It has classic one on one fight scenes as well as a lot of audience scenes where you feel really involved. I also like that Martin Freeman's character was not seen as some scared white guy or as a useless wimp. In some of the reviews that is the persons problem with the movie, but T'challas sister, who is the tech whiz, had to help to heal him and said ""Oh great, another broken white boy to fix."" This isn't said in a sarcastic way, but it is a reference to healing Bucky Barnes in Captain America: Civil war.
 This is my far the best stand alone marvel cinematic universe movie of the past 3 years."

","Another MARVEL hero is here and this time it's not quite the usual stuff. Having been introduced in the Captain America: Civil War, the Wakandan prince returns to the big screen as Black Panther. This is not exactly an origin story, but it's more of a continued chapter of T'challa's life after Captain America: Civil War. The movie tells us the legend of Black Panther and the life in Wakanda which has distanced itself from the rest of the world. The metal, Vibranium plays an important part in all of this which itself is pursued by the evil arms dealer Ulysses Klaue. After his father's death at the UN bombing, T'challa has to prove his worth to the throne while he tries to rid of Ulysses Klaue for good. But the pursuit leads him to know the truth about his uncle and cousin. T'Challa has to protect the misuse of Wakandan resources by fighting his cousin Erik Killmonger who takes over Wakanda by defeating him in a fight. <br/><br/>The plot of the movie is simple and also similar to many other superhero movies. However, the cultural and racial backdrop makes this movie very different from others. The city, Wakanda is one of the important aspect of the movie. It is technologically advanced than most part of the world and yet sticking to its cultural roots. Wakanda takes you to a different world altogether. This experience is enhanced by the background score which is very African and amazing costume design. Out of the very few scenes involving the outside world, the Seoul, action scene is a treat to watch. <br/><br/>Black Panther lays out a perfect platform for the coloured actors in Hollywood to showcase their talents. Driven by the commercial power of MARVEL Cinematic Universe, this film is going to be a career highlight for most of them. Chadwick Boseman has literally incorporated the phrase 'actions speak more than words' into his acting. He nails the African accent so much that it feels weird when the other characters speak in an American/British accent. Michael B Jordan as Erik Killmonger is a supercool villain this movie needed. While the movie fails to provide much substance to the characters of popular actors Angela Basset, Forrest Whitaker, Andy Serkis and Lupita Nyong'o, it surely has a lot to offer for Danai Gurira and Letitia Wright. They play the characters Okoye and Shuri respectively, who are almost like side kicks to Black Panther. Marting Freeman as agent Everett K. Ross has a slightly funny role. <br/><br/>Black Panther is not as entertaining as the other MCU movies, but it surely has its own charm.

Filmmaker Ryan Coogler - who co-wrote the screenplay with Joe Robert Cole - spreads his canvas with bold color, sharp designs and eye-popping visual effects and set pieces (the car chase is a humdinger) and wisely allows his supporting cast - namely the trifecta of actresses Nyong'o as the smart, sexy love interest Nakia; Gurira (bad ass all the way) as Okoye the lead warrior of T'Challa's kingdom and scene-stealer/secret weapon Wright (funny, bright and sharp as a tack) as his kid sister and Q to his Bond, genius tech inventor - to in many ways overshadow the lead yet steer him steadily into battle. Geeks will be all giddy as well to see an onscreen reunite of Gollum and Bilbo Baggins (Serkis and Freeman, respectively as a villain and FBI agent/comrade to the King). Kudos to Ludwig Goransson's royale score and Ruth E. Carter's majestic costumes. All hail!"

","I'm gonna have to go with the critics on this on this one, Black Panther was amazing! It wasn't completely flawless, but I will still give it a 10 star rating to balance the ratings a bit more. Honestly, I feel like the 1 star ratings are from people that didn't want to like the film from the start. There are barely any comedic jokes, the CGI was good (no CGI is absolutely perfect), the storyline was fantastic and the scenery was majestic. For those who were disappointed about the movie being boring, you shouldn't have expected a ton of action. Black Panther ORIGIN story is about his new responsibility, his ideals and Wakanda.

","I've seen a few superhero movies and in context this one is unique in that the panther is constrained in some respects by also having to be a ruler/politician of a country. the movie makes the viewer privy to some of the inner conflicts of this unique challenge. however, the idea behind the suit is very engaging, and the society something to consider and entertain: what if there existed a land never colonized, how would they fare? with technological advancement meeting tradition would a physical battle for the country's leadership be replaced by... voting? computerized selection? their tradition respects bloodlines and prowess. somehow i think the prodigious racial aspect of the movie has some people uncomfortable with that idea and imagery, likely causing them to squirm in their seats with their brains bursting trying to find every possible angle why this fictional superhero in a fictional country in a fictional universe is so utterly unrealistic!<br/><br/>so now a few weeks after release and the movie's overall reception has exceeded projections and expectations. now i've noticed what seems a concerted effort to slow or halt the appreciation and success of this artistic work of fiction: keep it out of the media, produce highly critical muted reviews, and refrain from mentioning it in public discourse (if at all possible). perhaps it will die a quieter death.<br/><br/>i believe it is, nonetheless, an amazing story! the part that reflects on america's unfairness to some of its less fortunate citizens certainly will offend many who are among the privileged, but again, this is a work of fiction, just like so many of the glimpses the public is given of africa - this continent with 50 some countries speaking over a thousand languages reduced to what amounts to a small backwater in the public's eye..."

"alliohaha","3","3","5","2 February 2020"," Black Panter
","It's a weak movie. It's too long, boring at times.
Being based on a comic book is a common handicap for Hollywood movies these days. Although it didn't stop Christopher Nolan from making some great films about a grown man in tights and with stupid rubber ears.
Let's face it: this movie brought so much money only because it was made a political statement. It was shoved down everyones throats as the first movie about a black superhero, made by black people. And it was a completely commercial move and actually hurt the officially declared cause. The only thing it proved is that black people can suck at making movies just as hard as white people do. Wait, maybe that was the point! Aha, than it was a win! Of sort... I guess...
Anyway, it should have made a point. It must have with all the hype. And the point apparently is that no matter how advanced is the technology africans get, their society is unable to evolve past primitive tribalism and monarchy.
Well, then the point is africans can achieve something important only when a magic meteor falls right on their heads, not on their own. 
Generally speaking, if you perceive the movie as a story that was supposed to tell us something about black people, and it was definitely advertised as such, the message you end up with is very bad.
Giving Oscars to a weak movie was clearly part of political censorship and just proves again the award has really nothing to do with a film's quality.
There are parts that I liked watching, like all bits with Andy Serkis. He would have made a great antagonist, but was retired too early. With him gone action loses appeal.
The civil war at the end is lame. There's no feeling Wakanda has advanced economy or military might. All you see is a couple of fliers and no heavy weaponry, lots of spears, though. The final battle looks like a brawl at a bar.
Ideological content is weak as well: they oscillate between isolationism or imperialism and at the end choose to come out and ""share"" technology. I wonder how would that work in modern economy.
Final verdict: weak, but it's always a pleasure to see Andy Serkis work."

"JC_Ride","3","3","5","31 October 2019"," The textbook definition of overrated!
","Deep down within Black Panther lies a great movie with a great message. Emphasis on the deep down, cause what we actually got is one of the most disappointing MCU movies ever. Where to begin with this! I'll start with the few things i liked. The score is nothing great and i personally much prefer original scores to just songs pilled together but still it's better than regular MCU ones. Michael B. Jordan does a great job as Killmonger (easily the best performance in the movie) and the directing and scenary is preety good and the costumes are nice as well (i much prefered the Civil War suit but whatever)! However, the negative outweigh the positive by a lot! The plot is as generic as humanly possible. Nothing more than *evil relative takes throne, hero takes it back* . Nothing new, nothing interesting and as predictable as possible (unless there was a person who thought Black Panther actually died midway through the movie)(also plot makes zero sense at all but its a Marvel movie so I'll allow it). Acting apart from Jordan is just ok, and some characters are extremely annoying (looking at you Shuri). The humour is also extremely mediocre and tries to pull off jokes that would have been considered funny 2 years ago (ahem, what are those) and i personally didn't laugh once. But those are just nitpicks compared to the 3 main problems! 1. Black Panther is too overpowered. He already was bulletproof, super strong, super fast and an expert martial artist. Did you really have to include the whole blast thing? That problem is prevalent with a lot of heroes but when he is so overpowered any sense of suspense is immediately lost. 2. The CGI is shockingly bad! One of the worst of all MCU movies! Like it certainly has some very nice shots but his animated suit is very poorly animated and the car chase and especially the final battle are hilariously bad in terms of CGI (literally looking like a PS2 game at times!). 3. Speaking of the final battle, the action is quite possibly the worst in any MCU film. Apart from the ok waterfall fight scenes, the first one is too dark to see anything, the car chase is ridiculous at best and the final battle is embarrassingly bad, in terms of logic, CGI, suspense... it fails at everything (once again a mediocre hero vs villain with exact samw powers final fight)! All in all this movie is a mess and it feels like it briefly took Marvel back to the early MCU. Unfortunately disappointing is the best i can say about it. 3/10 (Keep in mind i rate this movie solely as what i like and dislike about it as a movie! I am not reviewing it for its cultural effect or anything else in this review)"

Anyway, I was really looking forward to seeing Black Panther, after hearing all the hype. I was disappointed, as was everyone who saw it with me. Movies need to be about PEOPLE, not white people, or black people, or yellow people. I thought we've moved past this type of thing.
As a superhero movie, it was one of the most forgettable in recent years. Of course I sometimes like to watch movies of this type, even if they aren't the best. I may even watch it again someday. Maybe I'll like it more once the hype dies down, and I don't have any expectations. Some of the characters were very interesting, and I'd like to see more of them, with a better script."
"donaramu","4","3","5","14 May 2019"," Hype fail
","It is sad that political people add hype to a movie. Why can't we just enjoy a movie without someone trying to brainwash us?"
"joneshollaifuhearme","5","3","5","30 April 2019"," O Snap! The Hype is Political Correctness on Vibranium!
","Despite my lame title, it wasn't so much the dissonance between the movie and the spectacular hype surrounding it that was most jarring to me experientially - this would come later, rather it was that so many of the narrative elements were so spiritlessly conceived, assembled and executed, that it even got in the way of the entertainment of the thing.<br/><br/>The Vibranium powered hype is easy to understand. Marvel, a hot franchise, decides to do an all black cast Black Panther movie with a largely African setting, and banks on the novelty of the very thing for marketing vitality. The idea is rich in politics and rich in optimism - that quintessential of Hollywood opioids. The critics, already on a decades long MCU high, fall in love with the pre-sell and go in hard for their hit, and all at once what we get is a frenzied race to the bottom, critics working hard to outdo each other in elaborating and praising the addled qualities of their latest trip.<br/><br/>But the product is vastly different from the synthesized hype. Few things work and the whole is discord at best. Despite being armed with a massive budget, the makers seem to have been overwhelmed by the central task of populating the film with believable African characters with a back stories rooted in African reality and culture. As an African myself, this was particularly devastating for me. The accents were nothing like anything I have ever encountered. They weren't Fulani, Luo or Zulu, or generic Nigerian, Kenyan or Chadian. Instead they were all over the place, a little bit of this and a little bit of that, often fused within the same character, such that they came to us robbed of all semblance of singularity, the way, say, an Irish accent in a movie identifies a character to the audience as an Irishman and all the cornucopia of meaning and sensibility that comes with that. This to me was perhaps the original sin of the entire enterprise because it's all downhill from here. The actors could not get in to their characters because they were the worst sort of amalgams with no cultural unity, which led to very weak depthless portrayals, and even far more artless dramatic interactions between the characters on screen. The affected mannerisms by the actors played out more like burlesque than anything seriously intended to communicate humanity to the audience.<br/><br/>The direction and filmography of the movie seems to have come from a place that was either cognisant of these limitations and therefore endeavored to cover for them with various tricks of the trade, or was complicit in the negligence and it was, again, all they could do to hide this behind special effects, set design and costuming, and hope nobody watching caught the flaws.<br/><br/>The movie just doesn't work primarily because the people behind it were either too lazy, overwhelmed, or uninterested with delving into real research on the people and cultures that they were seeking to populate their production with. Instead they seem to have just copy pasted whatever they could put together from quick scans of Google search results and hoped for the best. There are numerous examples of this from the movie, but just one will suffice to show the extent of the travesty. The Jabari tribe, a mountain dwelling, wood carving, isolationist tribe, that worships Hanuman (the Hindu monkey god!), and whose calculated role in the movie seems to be to make the political statement that not everyone is for technological advancement, yet their leader (who sometimes speaks with a generic accent, other times with an Igbo one) makes a challenge for the throne of Wakanda. How farcical is that?<br/><br/>Perhaps someone will say that bringing an over critical eye to the movie experience is what's at fault here, that if I had just managed to get past the flaws I would have allowed myself to be entertained, but that to me is not how movies work. Films work, I contend, by directly engaging the audiences sense of empathy. They invite us to believe that the persons on the screen are real persons going through real imaginable experiences with real emotional consequences. We get to see this emotions captured on the faces of the actors, be it a smile, laughter, anger, sadness and everything between. Our minds ability to take flight, or get immersed within this simulation of life depends a great deal on its authenticity. By this I don't mean how realistic it is relative to everyday life (Audiences connect with animations and fantasy movies all the time). Rather, I mean how much our minds feel that the emotions, situations and characters portrayed mirror stimuli that is within our repertoire of familiarity. The more familiar, the more authentic and the more engaging the material is. Black Panther was simply none of this.<br/><br/>And that is really the tragic part, because all that that hype on steroids seemed to dwell on were notions on representation, the celebration of a hitherto marginalized people, the idea that finally peoples of African descent could go to the movies and see their lives reflected on the big screen. Instead, what Black Panther proves is that, for truly authentic African stories to be told, it's not the amount of money thrown at the project and the marketing thereof that will make the difference, but the heart and commitment of the storytellers in relation to their subject matter."

"Ed-Shullivan","6","3","5","23 February 2019"," We watched it at home...no interruptions...I fell asleep after the second major fight
","Academy award nominee for best picture? All I can say is, if this is the best example of an action film that has been produced that is actually worthy of a nomination for best picture than this has to be one of the worst years (2018) ever in the history of the film making industry. I mean, as far as a Marvel action film goes, this is definitely above average. The generally anticipated saturation of CGI (Computer Graphics Interface) technology was actually bearable, but the fight scenes were dragged out far too long.<br/><br/>Try and imagine a John Wayne western fight being dragged out for as long as the last fight in this movie was which takes place between cousins T'Challa / Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the super buff and shirtless Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). John Wayne enjoyed a long and illustrious career in many film genres and one of the ways he accomplished that was by making sure none of his fight scenes dragged on too long. So a little advice for my bro's Chadwick and Michael B. ""ya gotta no when to hold 'em, and know when to fold 'em"".<br/><br/>Mrs. Shullivan and I liked that the women warriors were all strong, black and beautiful women with a head on their shoulders and did not bend for any man, King or no King. The power struggle to mainatin the rare earth minerals, the civil war between the five (5) tribes, and the earlier scene where the young girls were being treated like cargo vaguely reminds us about what has transpired on the African continent over the past century. But kids won't get it, and adults want to see positive reinforcements without weaponizing the tribes.<br/><br/>It's a decent enough Marvel film, but I don't think it will be on my ""repeat"" list to watch anytime soon. I give the film a 6 out of 10 rating. Please don't disappoint us with any further bad choice Academy Award winners."
"dylanrubin-71820","3","3","5","20 February 2019"," Oscar Bait? Yeah no
","This coming Oscars season, Marvel Studios so called ""critically acclaimed film"" Black Panther has been nominated for Best Picture. Sure, the film offers somewhat decent visual effects, a funky soundtrack and a stacked cast, but is it worthy of their Oscar nod?<br/><br/>Many films over the last few decade have been snubbed of this critical award nomination, such as:
<ul><li>The Matrix, Cast Away, Kill Bill, The Dark Knight, Gran Torino, Foxcatcher, Gone Girl, Blade Runner 2049</li></ul><br/><br/>Each of these films encompass amazing scenes, cinematography, script, performances, and were all reviewed with critical success. Yet, none were even considered as a nomination for Best Picture, something many people still disagree with to this day, but black panther. Black Panther! Black panther gets a nomination?<br/><br/>The Dark Knight, often regarded as the best superhero live-action film of all time, with one of the few performances where someone was awarded an Oscar for their performance as a superhero character, was not nominated for best picture. Fair enough, it is a comic book movie. But, The Dark Knight is barely even considered a superhero film, rather, a drama, revolving around concepts of good and evil, and realistic themes, such as terrorism, justice and trust. It makes you consider, what made Black Panther so great to get this nomination?<br/><br/>Sure, Marvel has had an array of successful films, both critically and at the box office. However, is Black Panther ""the film"", that allows Marvel studios to obtain its first nomination for best picture?<br/><br/>In my opinion, Black Panther was an overrated picture. Heavily dominated by the African-American demographic of America, it was listed as the highest domestic box office statistics of all time. This is heavily due to the culture impact it had on the African-American community, however, quality over quantity.<br/><br/>I am not the only one who agrees that the only reason that Black Panther was nominated was due to this cultural wave. More often than not, the academy does not tend to go for big Hollywood, blockbuster films, who score big at the box office. Rather, they lean towards more independent, indie based films, which don't perform largely at the box office which don't tend to have large budgets.<br/><br/>Black Panther is the epitome of this philosophy. It made $1.3 billion USD at the global box office. It's budget was $200 million, typical of a Hollywood action movie. It's storyline and premise was basic, and it's character development was mediocre. For me, I was slightly entertained. It was part of the marvel films universe, and it had some decent action. However, I didn't leave the cinema impressed, or leave thinking that was a different movie that I've seen, or unique in any sort. It followed the same origin movie formula, something that has been occurring a lot lately. The antagonist was not depicted any better. Again, we see a villain who has the same ability, same suit as the protagonist, just with a different colour palate!?<br/><br/>I was shocked to see it receive this nomination this year, and even the speculations that it would win. Those who believe these rumours are consumed by the hype and the cultural trend of America. Overall, it was okay, but definitely not Oscar worthy.<br/><br/>The story of the film is convoluted, and it lacks any pizzazz that helps to make the film unique. I quite disliked level of acting also, and the overall need to use visual effects.<br/><br/>I am a little annoyed that a film like Black Panther gets nominated, yet ,""If beale street could talk"", doesn't get any nomination at all? It just shows how the academy can become so convinced of a film to be nominated, due to the overall outcry from a general audience.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the critics got this one extremely wrong. It received a 97% on rotten tomatoes, another biased marvel based review! It was crazed by everyone, and that is what originally made me excited for the film. Upon my arrival however, I came to realise how wrong I was. A ""What are those"" Joke in 2018, really? The comedy was so generic and utterly butchered, that I didn't have much to enjoy in the movie except for Kendrick Lamar's soundtrack.<br/><br/>I am disappointed that this is the film that creates ""history"" by receiving a best picture nomination, and I believe the academy gave in to the bait on this one, big time."

Why is Killmonger so obsessed with ""freeing"" people he doesn't have any connection with except for a melanin level?
Why didn't black panther chase Killmonger and his crew after their first heist?
Why did Killmonger burn the plants that ensured the lifeline would go on?
There is one thing I really like
And that's Michel b Jordan as Killmonger.
As much as I hate his motives, I think that is kind of intentionally as it shows you how distant he is from any sort of sense. He is however genuinely entertaining and I love most of the things that come out of mouth.

This is just another super hero movie, and it follows all of the safe, bland super hero movie conventions.<br/><br/>I do appreciate that the film is driven by African American characters and themes, because Lord knows if any genre needed a dose of color (or estrogen for that matter), the super hero genre was it. And I also appreciate how the film uses a super hero movie setting to explore questions of black identity in the larger world. But folks are giving it way too much credit. I was actually shocked by how poorly directed the film was, especially the climactic battle scenes, a hot mess if ever there was one, and how terrible the visual effects were. The film looks incredibly cheap.<br/><br/>And it's all just so silly, which is how I feel about all super hero movies. In super hero world, everyone wears ridiculous costumes and speaks in formal, portentous accents, and says things like ""vibranium"" with a straight face. This movie, like others of its ilk, would do well to plant its tongue a bit more firmly in cheek. <br/><br/>No, ""Black Panther"" benefited from timing. It was the movie people needed in the cultural moment, and I think audiences were seeing what they wanted to see in it whether it was really there or not. But divorced from that specific cultural moment, the film doesn't seem like anything special. <br/><br/>Grade: B"

","Seeing as how this movie beat box office records and rottentomatoes rates it at 97% I was eager to watch this movie.<br/><br/>But after enduring this simple formulaic story I am wondering, am I taking crazy pills? True the CGI is amazing and the cast is all-black but the story... there is quite a bit missing. Maybe the movie critics got bribed by Marvel to boost the ratings but I can't see how this got such high ratings.<br/><br/>The storyline reminds me of those children's books in which there is barely any character development. ""See the dog run, the dog barks. The End"" In this movie we have a bunch of one-dimensional characters and simple situations. ""Bad guy wants to destroy the world, stop bad guy.

","If this is critically acclaimed and highly rated, how bad must a flick be to get a low rating?<br/><br/>To be fair: Black Panther is not exactly a bad movie - it simply isn't a good one either. It's just formulaic, by-the-numbers, plotless, shallow superhero-mainstream featuring an all black cast sporting a white sidekick, making it kind of an inverse Iron Man 2. Some CGI is cringeworthy. Character development can't happen since the movie lacks characters, exclusively relying on stereotypes.<br/><br/>Partly entertaining but doesn't live up to the hype.

","I could tell by the early reviews and trailers that this was not going to be one of my favorite MCU movies, but I expected it to at least be a fun, enjoyable movie. T'Challa is so dull and boring in this after being the BEST part of Civil War. The CGI is inexcusably bad in multiple scenes, and the jokes fall as flat as can be. Yet the worst part of the ENTIRE movie for me was the villain, Killmonger. When I tell you that this character was beyond cringe-inducing in every single scene, I am not exaggerating. I am a Michael B. Jordan fan, but this was brutal to watch. The dialogue was laughably corny and predictable, and the execution of said dialogue was equally corny and rough. I did not enjoy a single scene in this entire movie, and there is not one MCU movie I want to watch again less than this..(okay maybe Hulk)."

"Zacthewac","1","3","5","26 May 2018"," Gives new definitions to words like Ludicrous!
","If you want to see a good film with an African based protagonist, watch any variation of Tarzan or King Kong. Even Magilla Gorilla cartoons had richer dialogue, more finely developed characters and a lot more credibility. Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space, which is widely considered to be the worst film ever, was far more believable than this high budget, super hyped trash.<br/><br/>Stories with boundaries of imagination, as Rod Serling put it, still have rules within the fantasy worlds they create. If the premise of the story is a man who can read minds or a woman who is compelled to tell the truth, the reality of the created world stays within the walls of that premise. The mind reader can't just instantaneously develop super powers and use them to knock out his charging enemies. Superman can fly, toss buildings around, bend bridges and even turn back time but he can't just build a flying space ship around his body and have it shoot missiles at armies. <br/><br/>This film makes it up as it goes. Fights are decided based on how much strength and how many weapons instantly become accessible to a given warrior, at a given moment. If the filmmakers want someone to be losing a battle, his or her enemy will have the strength, weapons and indestructibility to win. If they want the fight to turn around, anything and everything the person needs to reverse it and emerge victorious will miraculously appear. There are no rules or boundaries within the reality they attempt to create, so in turn, there is zero credibility. People believe the impossible but not the improbable. This is an impossible story that throws in new improbables with virtually every frame.<br/><br/>IMDB users seem mostly unified in feeling that this film is beyond awful. For whatever reason, it still has a 98% score from Rotten Tomatoes. And for whatever reason, after I rented the film from my cable provider, I wasn't given the option of rating it. I guess, if millions of dollars are spent to promote a Hollywood blockbuster, sites like Rotten Tomatoes only allow those who support their agendas to vote. <br/><br/>Read the other IMDB reviews before you squander your time and money on this one. There are a limited number of hours in all of our lives and watching this film is a total waste of two of those hours."
"cutesd","7","3","5","17 May 2018"," Not my favorite Marvel film
","I had heard that Black Panther was supposed to be excellent so I was excited to see it. I think I can understand, having a movie about Africa that ISN'T about slavery, genocide, apartheid, AIDS, war lords, or child soldiers is kind of unheard of ... and in that light this film is awesome. I applaud the long list of strong female characters present in this film. And they got the freaking A-List for this film, the acting talent was unimpeachable. <br/><br/>My issue with this film is the story: they used such a generic and overly used storyline which was DEEPLY disappointing. The plot is just a superhero version of the Lion King which we all know got its plot from Hamlet. It made me feel like a movie I'd already seen 15 times before and that really bummed me out.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the film is populated with all these interesting characters and a new country and culture that we never find out much about. Who are the Dora Milaje? How did it come to be that Wakanda is protected by a group of badass bald females? What's with the hand to hand combat to determine the next king? What's the significance of the masks? Why does that mountain tribe worship Hanuman (whose roots are Hindu)? Why is the mountain tribe all trouble-making? What's the deal with the Wakandan spy missions all over the world? What's with the lip tattoos? Why do they glow like that? How do they get them? Are they hereditary or what?<br/><br/>Or how about just more history on the relationships between the primary cast? What's the story between T'Challa and Nakia? Was Shuri born a child prodigy or was she trained to be head of technology? What's the deal between Okoye and W'Kabi? Are they lovers? Married? What? And what's T'Challa's relationship with W'Kabi? Did they grow up together? Are they best friends? We're told extremely little about any of these people and we're just supposed to infer everything based on a few random interactions.<br/><br/>So I was left not feeling very much for these characters as they jump from action scene to action scene to action scene to ... yawn. Plus, there was nothing new to the action sequences ... and it's just all been done before so many times I got bored. <br/><br/>THEN, add to that, I'm not even sure WHEN this movie is supposed to be taking place. During Civil War? After Civil War? Because if it's during Civil War ... like after the father was killed and before Bucky was brought to Wakanda ... then it blows the big is-T'Challa-dead part of the film because we know he has to live to go after Bucky. If it's after Civil War then why did they say in Civil War that T'Challa was king? It's sloppy stuff like this that makes me crazy.<br/><br/>And lastly, the film felt tonally off from the other films ... and not in a good way like Thor Ragnarok. It's like this film couldn't decide what tone to take, so it was part storytelling/fantastic/mythology ... then part gritty/urban/dark ... then part glossy/tech-heavy/action flick. If it had just picked ONE of those and stuck with it I probably would've loved it but instead it was a mishmash and didn't do any of them well and left the whole thing feeling off.<br/><br/>I give it a 7 because I didn't really dislike the film, and for me even a so-so Marvel film is still way better than most movies Hollywood makes today. But I was disappointed. I wanted better and it's a shame that this film didn't get a richer, unique story to do credit to the acting talent and overall opportunity that existed in the making of this film."

"dcephas27-294-843990","5","3","5","12 March 2018"," What can I say that hasn't already been said...
","I dragged my feet to see this movie after reading reviews and comments about the hype, video glitches and political undertone. However my lovely wife really want us to go. Well with me being pretty much in line with what us real people comment in IMDB I still didnt want to blow $40 on a movie night for a movie that may be a fail. So i watched it via a different venue. And I am glad I did. The first thing I want to say and my wife agrees is that the BS hype about how good this movie is was so bloated that it is clearly FAKE news. Good grief! Is that why it made so much money because so many went there thinking it was all that? <br/><br/>First off, I didn't sense any covert political overtone, and wasn't bothered by it. The synergy between modern technology and the tribe culture was totally lacking. I mean the garbs and the wall decor just didn't go together well with the aircraft, building layout etc at all. The car chase scene was terribly weak, not sure what was missing...more collisions and/or explosions, I dont know. As far as the acting, no particular actor really jumped out at me, though I did like Letitia Wright, she brought in the much needed bits of humor. Not until the last few mins when Michael Jordan shows up at the tribe camp and starts to be the A-hole did the movie become interesting. If I compare this to a action movie like Skyfall there is no comparison. None. Nor does it come close to Thor or the Avengers movies so Marvel did themselves an injustice by putting their mark on this one. I don't know what to call it...a very weak action movie or a boring drama with a bit of action? And to think one of my co-workers said she went 3 times, and another went twice. When i think of seeing a movie two and three times, it would be something like Avatar, King Arthur, or any of the Daniel Craig Bond movies. I am just so glad that I didnt have to spend a dime to sit through this one. It fills the billet for a B movie to me. Shame on the media and critics for propping this flick up with HUGE pillars. Shame shame shame."

It has a 97% on rotten tomatoes. People and including and especially critics are saying this is better that the best superhero movies like The Dark Knight (Which is one of the best movies of all time by the way) and Superman (1978). The humor is incredibly cringe worthy and awkward. The villains motivation is completely basic. All the characters have no complexity at all.

"man14","6","3","5","26 February 2018"," Big disappointment - I expected a lot more with all the hype.
","Warning: It contains very minor spoilers.<br/><br/>I so wanted this film to be as good as the reviews said it was, I really did. Black Panther is one of my favorite characters from the comics and I couldn't wait to see it's solo film after the great debut of the character in Captain America: Civil War. Boy, was I in for a disappointment!<br/><br/>Where do I start? Well, the storyline was old, totally predictable (I've seen it done before and better), and parts of it didn't make sense, at all. Even though the movie is more than two hours long, the story feels too short. Maybe it's because the writers made it so political, it felt the film was trying too hard to pass a political message the whole time, instead of just trying to tell a good story about a great character. The truth is, when I watch a superhero movie, I don't want to be preached at, I want to see a good story and the hero kick ass. If I want to watch a socially relevant movie, I'll watch Amistad or Selma, not Black Panther.<br/><br/>The visuals of the film were gorgeous - the photography was beautifully done, the sets were awsome and the costumes looked great. But without a good story and strong characters, all that means nothing. Which brings me to the characters: the main character comes out very weak, I didn't care much for him and that's a big problem when we're talking about the hero of the film! I don't think it was Chadwick Boseman's fault, since I liked him in Captain America: Civil War, I think the problem was the screenplay and the way they wrote the character. He did the best he could with what he had, but it just wasn't enough.
Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o are just about the best thing in this film, they play two gorgeous and very strong women - two great actresses with a bright future ahead of them (I think I'm a little in love with Lupita Nyong'o, she's simply one of the most beautifull women I've ever seen and with such an amazing talent!). Letitia Wright played the hero's younger sister Shuri, and she's a good actress, but the way they wrote her character made her annoying at times instead of the comic relief she was suposed to be.
As for the villain, well it's simply one of the dullest and most uninteresting villain in movie history. And it didn't help that Michael B. Jordan played him that way too. Totally forgetable. The one good thing in this film villain wise was Andy Serkis - he had a blast playing Klaue and you could see it. Too bad he was criminally underused.
Forest Whitaker and Angela Bassett were their usual very good selfs, and Martin Freeman played with a perfect american accent a CIA agent that turned out to be an otherwise completely useless character.<br/><br/>The action sequences were good, although Marvel as given us better before. The CGI is overall good, although some scenes are a bit blured. The direction is sloppy at times, but overall competent.<br/><br/>All in all, it's your average Marvel film: it looks good, it entertains, but it lacks depth and suffers from a major shortage of good story and good characters, so you forget it as soon as you leave the theater. My sugestion? Save your money for Avengers: Infinity War (fingers crossed that it'll be epic!) and wait for this one to come to Netflix."

","Its tacky to rate a movie when there are many fine elements well positioned. Its a Marvel story so we dont have a choice, its a Superhero movie and anything goes. So here's what I thought ""Will I want to see the movie again?"" Or enjoy to see again? I guess not. Now will I want to see the movie ""Rush"" Niki Lauda and James Hunt - yeah! How about Ironman 'Yes'. Thor? About maybe, sure. Captain America? Maybe not.<br/><br/>Whats the difference? Great movies have great actors that can carry the persona in a cool way. You want to see that action again because you love the character. Actually, you can watch Black Panther in the theatre, and then forget about it - without desire to see it again.<br/><br/>Another take is, for Africa to map up, it must measure by European Standards - like ""Wakanda"". One always takes a legacy to build up fiction. Iron Man has a legacy of American technology, more like Vision and its imaginable. Africa doing a Wakanda isnt a vision, its something that can be a joke, as in ""In your dreams"". What I mean is there's a yardstick of how it must be and then its all illusion to make someone feel important - who hasnt really shown any such attribute themselves. Th 90+ rating on review sites frankly bums you up for Black Panther. If it was a white guy, this movie's rating would be 25%."

","Most action scenes were lit poorly and shots cut so fast that it gave me a headache. Throughout the entire movie the only scenes where there is tension are the moments when T'Challa is fighting without the suit. The end fighting scene looked like a PS2 game. Some scenes had an awkwardly bad green screen, unfortunately. A character in the end gets their throat slit and there was no blood?? No one wants to say it this way, but essentially what Killmonger wants is to kill an entire race. T'Challa's character is painted as a character whose decisions are all correct and morally justified. Most jokes in this movie are pretty bad, but Shuri's are the worst. Also, Ramonda disappeared and never came back?? I would watch this movie again if it was playing on T.V. and I was too lazy to change the channel."
"StaneSKT","10","57","198","13 February 2018"," Beyond Expectations!
","Long Live The King! Whatever I say about the movie will be a little. Definitely ""Black Panther"" takes its place as one of the strongest movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The cast is probably the best in a Marvel solo movie. ""Black panther"" shows an unseen part of the MCU - Wakanda, their tribes, secrets and their way of life.<br/><br/>Indeed, one of the strongest features of the film is the acting of everyone in this movie. I can't say only one name, but Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Andy Serkis, Danai Gurira, Angela Basset, Letita Wright and Forest Whitaker are just some of the best characters in this movie.<br/><br/>The story is really strong, which makes the movie so good. Michael B. Jordan played the role of Erik Killmonger brutally. After the movie ends, the villain gets stuck in your mind, just because you understand his motivation and is presented perfectly. If you have not become Chadwick Boseman's fan in ""Captain America: Civil War,"" it's inevitable now! T'Challla must lead his people, be king and hero at the same time, which is a heavy burden. Every scene between him and his sister Shuri is a pleasure. She is only 16 years old, but her intellect can be compared to that of Tony Stark and Bruce Banner.<br/><br/>Special attention should be paid to every action scene. Movements and choreography are just unparalleled. You will make sure you see Black Panther, Killmonger and Okoye in action.<br/><br/>The colors in this movie are unique! The effects are great. At some point you will think that some things are not necessary, but you will eventually see that everything is done with intent. I give an example with the new Black Panther suit, which has many new and useful features.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is among the best of all Marvel movies so far, culled by Kendrick Lamar. After the end of the movie you will want to listen to the soundtrack again and again.<br/><br/>The film does not have a weak spot, it introduces the story of Wakanda in depth, introduces us to many new characters, all of whom are great. The soundtrack and action scenes are one of the many perfect combinations in this movie. The villain is memorable and the acting is on a whole new level.<br/><br/>In the future, ""Black Panther"" will be one of the often watched Marvel movies, as T'Challa is a person who easily gains the audience's sympathy, and you will not have passion to see him in ""Avengers: Infinity War"".<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you want an amazing experience, watch the movie as soon as possible!"

","Black Panther...WOW. What can I say? It's just a fantastic movie that finally showcases a demographic that have been CLAMORING for a flick showing positive imagery for A LONG TIME. Basically we've been waiting FOREVER and a DAY, for a serious Black Superhero with excellent supporting cast, and magnificent writing from a black man/crew. In a word the movie was STUPENDOUS. <br/><br/>It was great seeing Black people portrayed in every way possible in one film. Whether they were the warrior, the villain, the usurper, the tech-wizard, the King, etc. it was fantastic to see this many black people in a movie that doesn't have to do with slavery, or drug-running, or ghettos, or ratchet behavior. A superhero film portraying a black person in a black setting, with positive imagery ... it was worth the wait.<br/><br/>I love every moment of this movie. On criticism though - I actually wish it was a little bit longer. Like around 25 minutes longer. A couple more fight scenes and more background on other character would have been nice, but otherwise it was an almost perfect movie! Go and see it ASAP, truth knows no colour!!"

","This movies production is a merger of South Korea, Georgia (USA) and Australia. I have never read the comic books but this movie is very well done. The locations, the cast, and the production between Marvel, Disney, and Lucas Films is once again film magic.<br/><br/>The Scenery is astounding, the special effect are right on, and most importantly the script is excellent giving the actors room to act and they do it so well. One of the Script Writers, is also the director(Ryan Coogler) of the film Creed. There are a couple members of the cast from that film too. The costumes are amazing, and the sound track is spot on. <br/><br/>The theme of unity at the end is a good message. The film length at slightly over 2 hours is about right. As far as the entertainment, well Stan Lee is definitely holding on here for safe keeping. Andy Serkis from the Apes movie series is Ulysses Klaue, and though his role is cut short, he plays him to the hilt. Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan head up a talented cast. The ladies including Lupita Nyong (Star Wars-The Force Awakens) do not by any stretch take a back seat to the male cast.<br/><br/>There's so much action, it is very nearly the end of the film before there is any romance. By the time the films kisses come, well, the credits roll shortly after. There's lots of crudos to go around on this movie. Martin Freeman (The Hobbit) is Everett K Ross, a former pilot and CIA agent whose nowhere near being in charge in this film.

","Hey all, with Avengers Infinity Wars is around the corner Black Panther is roaring at the box office worldwide. You can't miss this extravaganza, because if you do so then actually you are missing an art film which is crafted so well that each frame is splendid. Since release, people are talking about this movie and already broke some opening weekend collections at the box office surpassing major superhero/action films.<br/><br/>From the start to the last, every scene is scripted well in a manner that you will definitely realize how a king should be. It took 10 years & 17 movies to bring this connection between characters especially the king T'Challa aka Black Panther. Last you saw him in Captain America Civil War which made everyone want this character more and led this epic movie to be a success.<br/><br/>The movie is all about a fictional nation Wakanda (in South Africa) and element Vibranium (fictional). The story revolves around T'Challa his family, foes and loved ones where Politics is much more highlighted. The strong bond between T'Challa & Shuri is really appreciable which is rarely seen in any movies. The tech used by Wakanda is far more ahead than any of Tony's techs. The leader of Special forces/chief security head of the king is loyal to the kingdom. In between, you may feel that you are seeing Hollywood version of Kattappa (Baahubali).<br/><br/>Movie lags in between which is correct because Director Ryan Coogler wants the audience to understand the character very well which they can later connect him with other members of the Avengers team. He is not only the King of Wakanda but also the King of MCU and he deserves the respect. Because many questions will be answered at the end and we can expect some blast in Avengers Infinity Wars. Actions sequences are for more well choreographed. Wakanda kingdom, people, traditions etc are visualized beautifully. Official movie runtime is 130 minutes which is honestly acceptable for this wonderful movie. Many things to be said, but this much is enough and rest you can experience at nearby theatres.<br/><br/>Tony Stark is definitely going to be jealous of him. Must watch movie for everyone.<br/><br/>Bold, Beautiful & Epic. Ratings: 4.5/5"

I think this is one of the best Marvel movies they have ever made. Visually it was stunning. The action was top notch. But beyond all that, I thought the story was great and well written. Michael B. Jordan stole the show and was convincing in his anger and thirst for revenge. 
Overall, I loved it and thought that everyone involved did a great job. I'm sure I'll see it again in the theater and I'll probably buy it down the road."
"DarkVulcan29","10","22","70","18 February 2018"," Black Panther has arrived
","The Marvel universe just keeps expanding here, in every good way. After Chadwick Boseman first appeared has the Black Panther in Captain America Civil War, you knew like Wonder Woman it would not be long before he would get his own movie. I heard back in the 90's they where trying to get a Black Panther movie in hopes it would starring Wesley Snipes in the title role, but it did not happen and Wesley Snipes went on to play another Marvel character known has Blade.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
So how does this film hold up, I gotta say pretty well. Action scenes are pretty well done, like in any other superhero movie. Fight scenes are awesome to watch. And the effects are mind blowing. Chadwick Boseman gives a likable performance has the main character, I mean you really route for him all the way. Let's not forget Michael B. Jordan has the villain Killmonger, and the rest cast do well also. I'm looking forward for more Black Panther films in the future."
"sildarmillion","10","7","17","22 February 2018"," My take on the hype (mild spoilers)
","Yes, the hype surrounding Black Panther has everything to do with the all-black cast, black director, black screenwriters, etc. But at the same time, this movie is going to be looked upon as a landmark in African American cinema. (I'm not the best person to explain why, but if you are interested, I recommend the video ""Black Panther is blacker than you thought"" by Screen Junkies News. I'm not afiliated with them. Just thought it was a good video.)<br/><br/>As a popcorn movie, Black Panther is okay. Thor: Ragnarok serves better as a popcorn movie. But, being familiar with Ryan Coogler's previous work, I wasn't expecting this to be a action-filled blockbuster. I went in expecting him to have some profound things to say. And I thought he did have a lot of interesting things to say.<br/><br/>1. I am very used to watching Euro-centric fantasy. So getting to see an Afro-centric fantasy that was markedly difference was a strange and refreshing experience. Black Panther falls under this niche genre of Afro-futurism, one of the aspects of which is to imagine what Africa could have been without the influence of colonialism. This, I thought, made for a great genre for speculation and world-building. And the world of Wakanda, with its 5 tribes with their distinct cultures and clothes and customs, was a vivid and immersive experience.<br/><br/>2. A lot of the weight of the movie comes from the fact that it is from an African perspective rather than an American one. Imagine what the story might have been like from an American perspective. Say, five years ago, if you heard we were going to get a fantasy story set in Africa told from an American perspective (but let's say it wasn't based on the Black Panther comics), you might expect something like this: An African American kid from the inner city learns that his father was a prince from a technologically advanced African nation that stays hidden from the world. He trains himself to become strong and then travels there. he makes a challenge from the throne. And when he becomes king, he vows to fight against the oppression that black people face all over the world. Sounds like an inspirational fantasy, no? Except that's not what it feels like to all those other countries who are not the USA. At the end of the day, Erik Killmonger is an American go goes into an African nation and overthrows the government. Like America does. Like America has done. America is not viewed as a hero across the globe.<br/><br/>3. After his experiences with Killmonger, King T'Challa is forced to consider his priviledge and he wonders whether he has a responsibility to use his knowledge and wealth to help the poor, the downtrodden, the refugees. What a powerful way for Ryan Coogler to speak directly to the most powerful nations of our world. (There is also a little but of commentary on how present-day Africans, especially the ones who are wealthy and priviledged, often look down upon and do not sympathize at all with the plight of those of African descent in the Americas, Europe, and the Caribbean. It hardly ever gets talked about, but it happens.)<br/><br/>4. Lastly, this movie had the best representation of women I have ever seen in any fantasy. You have 4 prominent female roles and they are each allowed to be different. They each have their own ideas, own views, beliefs, and convictions, and their own sense of purpose. They are similar in some ways and different in others. Some of them represent the traditional side of Wakanda and some of them represent the progressive side and their interactions reflects the struggle Wakanda faces in balancing the two. Each of them - Shuri, Okoye, the queen mother, and Nakia are fully fleshed out characters. And because there are so many of them, the female representation does not come down to only one person who then gets picked apart. Becaue there's four them, they each get to be different and diverse. <br/><br/>I understand that to most audiences, these reasons above aren't why they go to the movies. And so it's completely understable why all of this commentary doesn't factor in to their enjoyment of the film. I happen to be part of that group of audiences who enjoy the heck out of commentary, especially when it is doen masterfully and about a topic that appeals to me. That's why the movie had such a big impact on me."

","This movie wasn't that good to begin with.
It amazes me when RT thinks that it's the best MCU movie ever made.<br/><br/>DEPTH
It didn't have a lot of depth.
It feels like they are trying to go deep when it comes to morals by bringing oppression when it comes to the villains ideologi but they executed it poorly.
Most of the depth they where trying to show where minimal and they never made you think.
This movie was really simple the ""depth"" that was shown consisted of someone saying that this is bad and why and the other say ""This aint bad cause the benefits are this"" that's all nothing more it is.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS
The characters are really bad.
T'Challa is very bland character with no charisma at all and he has no depth when it comes to him.
He dosen't develop as a character and he never grows into something better.
There is minimal History shown behind this character and his desire is to be a good king, The villain is mediocre i will talk about him later, and nothing changes with him cause his desire to be king is so minimal cause he is pretty much a good king.
He shouldn't be a good king he should be a flawed king that want's to do good and become better.
But he is a good king cause they never show his flaws as a king he basically knows what he is gonna do as king.
And he is also op he kan never get hurt cause even Vibranium wont give him a scratch and if people hit him repeatedly he could just send a big wave that makes everyone fly away.
The suspense is gone when they do that and we never have the feeling of ""will he make it?"".
The side characters are bland as well and they lack depth.<br/><br/>VILLAIN
The villain is mediocre
His motivation is help the helpless by starting a war.
It's not a bad motivation but it never gets developed and that's what makes him a pretty bland villain lack of development behind motivation.<br/><br/>ACTION
The action is really well choreographed in my opinion it kept my interest.
But the final battle was horrendous and bland as hell it had no creativity into it just a bland fist fight.<br/><br/>CGI
The CGI was terrible whenever it kicked in stuff felt out of place specially in the final battle that's when the cgi where at it's worst.<br/><br/>VERDICT

","I think this film's has garnered so much popularity due to its casting, producing a nearly all black cast is wonderful to see, signs that this industry is moving in the right direction becoming more diverse. However while this is wonderful to see, it doesn't make a good movie. That comess down to the story telling, direction and acting.<br/><br/>Michael B. Jordan I thought was just terrible, he delivered his lines in such an awkward way I couldn't not laugh at a few of them. Chadwick Boseman I thought was good, although he was definitely given a much better character to work with in like Jordan's who I thought just wasn't written well enough. The film relies too much on visual effects, I must've seen this film at least 2 or 3 times and just can't really remember the ending, it's just not memorable. Andy Serkis for me was the standout performance though his was short but sweet, he made a good villain again unlike Jordan compare the two and Jordan comes up 2 dimensional, easy to suss and forgettable.<br/><br/>I personally didn't enjoy the film nearly as much as other people I just saw as 2 hours of visuals that was there to pave the way for Infity war, forgettable story and characters, to see this consistently ranked best marvel film absolutely baffles i'd place it in the lower tier, hopefully the second will be better."

","Always looked forward to the Marvel installments, but this one fell flat. The movie was overly hyped and lacked likeable characters except one.

The movies CGI car chase scene had a Green Lantern feel, the bad guy Erik Killmonger was more annoying than anything else. The spectators on the cliff during the ritual fight was probably the cheesiest part of the movie.

","This film seems to have done something that many Marvel films have been lacking in recent years, it conveyed real emotion. 
There wasn't the regular reliance on quick witted jokes when fight scenes were becoming boring which have become commonplace in Thor, Dr Strange, and Avengers. Instead each fight scene was important for the development of the plot and the character arcs often showing us the struggles characters had choosing their loyalties between country, humanity or their loved ones.
This movie avoided, for the most part, the cliche of the all powerful object which if the enemy get their hands on it will bring about the destruction of the universe as we know it. In Black Panther the story trying to be told is of the dangers of isolationism and the conflicts and caveats to blind loyalty to your country not the normal story told in Marvel films of fighting against the threat of the destruction of the universe. There a thread of ideas weaved throughout this film, illusions to the injustices of colonialism and slavery, and the many injustices that persist in our world today like the ever widening wealth inequality on earth and across the USA. This change of tone may have thrown some regular Marvel enthusiasts off slightly but it is vitally important. I believe that the inability to see these messages or the rejection of the truth in them is something that has driven many bad reviews on this site.
The director and writer managed to build multiple interesting characters all with developed characteristics and understandable reasoning behind their actions. Our main antagonist for example had an important relatable world view and his motivations were not so different from many of the hero's of Marvel and DC.
I am thoroughly shocked at the amount of negative reviews on this site and have noticed that the only criticisms they have been able to conjure could be applied to any comic book based film from the last 10 years. It seems they've been placed here to slander the film when there is little evidence that any of these 'critics' have actually taken the time to watch this film.
I need not mention the great things this film has done for the empowerment of poc and women. As a white man I may be the wrong person to represent what Hollywood's acceptance that a film like this needed to be made means to the world. With a nearly all black cast and strong female characters in positions we wouldn't normally see them in technology and war we're finally seeing some progress. I'm happy to see that Hollywood is changing its ways and I hope this isn't just an isolated example.
Along with Winter Soldier, Guardians and Wonder Woman I rate this as one of Marvels greatest successes, I hope they continue to make movies like this in the future and less of the over reliance of Bathos that we've seen in recent years in Dr Strange and Avengers."

","Black Panther is now the 18th instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the last before what was envisioned as the ""End Game"" when the first launched, in Infinity War later this year. Having debuted in 2016's Avengers: Civil War, Chadwick Boseman brought a grace to the future King of Wakanda as well as an interesting opportunity to show a unique setting in the Marvel Universe - Wakanda is an African land that has isolated itself from the wider world for thousands of years to preserve its unique technological advances brought on by a Vibranium meteor crashing there. In the soil atop the meteor a seemingly magic plant grows that gives those that drink it the power of the mystical Black Panther - protector of the realm. Boseman's T'Challa is to take up the crown upon his return following his father's death in Civil War, which the film happens only weeks after.<br/><br/>Disney/Marvel have, as do most big budget franchises, a bad history of letting directors follow their visions without constraint or interference. In recent times they did permit Rian Johnson free reign all over Star Wars and James Gunn was able to operate almost in isolation with the second Guardians, with both perhaps displaying why they had been so reluctant. This happened in the wake of the Edgar Wright / Antman situation that disappointed most of everyone, Wright most of all after nearly a decade trying to bring it to the big screen. For the job of helming Black Panther Marvel inlisted Creed director Ryan Coogler which leads to talk about the politics of the film. Briefly. <br/><br/>Black Panther is being toted, wrongly, as the first black superhero (Blade, Hancock, Spawn, Steel) and is also the first wilfully racially segregated production in decades by having an all black cast and crew, with very few exceptions. Discussing the aim of the films political messaging is not the objective here, though I will simply say that prohibiting a person from working on a film for being born in the wrong skin should be unacceptable. Yes, it takes place in Africa so there would be an overwhelming majority of black people, though realities racial dispersion doesn't ordinarily prohibit achieving a ""diverse"" on screen group. Any further reading of the political elements will be put aside unless relevant to the film making choices or some other significant role.<br/><br/>Coogler brought in his Creed leading star, Michael B. Jordan, to play nemesis Killmonger mirroring T'Challa's calm with a burning rage. Returning to the MCU after a brief cameo in Age of Ultron is Andy Serkis as arms dealer and Vibranium extraordinaire Ulysses Klaue, now complete with a lethal limb. Other notable additions are Dania Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o as one of the Kings key advisors/ generals and love interest respectively, Forrest Whitaker as spiritual leader and former spy, Angela Basset as mother of the king, Sterling K. Brown lining up as leader of a Wakandan tribe and Martin Freeman as the token - I mean - CIA operative Everett Ross. 
Narratively, the opening is choppy, jumping through essentially three different openings back to back. It does occasionally settle in to a pattern only to just as soon forget about it, as such certain elements or plots end up being rushed through when others seemed overlong. This then takes away the punch of certain arcs conclusions, removing the resonance or significance Coogler tried to dictate. There is also a deal of continent hopping through the first half that adds to the choppy feeling before we really touch down in Wakanda. Once there, T'Challa must earn his throne through ritual combat before beginning his first real kingly duties - tracking down Ulysses Klaue, the only man to steal Vibranium from Wakanda. In doing so, he crosses paths with Everett Ross who is also pursuing Klaue. During the pursuit of Klaue, Killmonger begins to assert himself against T'Challa and challenge his right to rule, questioning the isolationism and hording of advanced technology. <br/><br/>It is in dealing with these topics the film does occasionally get distracted trying to preach to its audience and score modern day political points, that the actual debate being played out fails to go deeper than the surface. Other conflicts emerge when the film tries to frame historical issues in a negative manner, even having enemies agree about its awfulness, before the ending sets up Wakanda taking the action the film had been decrying. This not done in a ""now I understand history a little better"" but more of a ""it was wrong when they did it, but its okay for us"" fashion. <br/><br/>As is tradition with Marvel films we do get an opening action scene which exposed one weakness in Coogler's directing. Much of the action is filmed too close to follow, with the near pitch black of the setting only exacerbating the problem. The later, more grounded action elements fair better, highlighting the more athletic nature of Boseman, as well as displaying some of Coogler's flair for style. Jordan's physicality is equally well performed, no doubt thanks to time spent boxing in recent years, continuing to tell the story in his actions. The biggest flaw with the larger set-piece action scenes is that they are undermined by the low-quality CGI on display, an issue that plagues the film. Larger creations, such as the animals, stick out like a sore thumb, never once creating a sense of tangibility. When we do get to Black Panther leaping around the screen, he looks very rubbery, reminiscent of Neo in the Matrix Reloaded. Even simpler computer enhancements are poor; a scene that only required the generation of a small crowd on a cliffside ends up looking like the creator just copied and pasted the same 4 small groups to pad out the shot. Similarly, some of the rendered backdrops look like the back projections from Goldfinger. This issue is not solely the effects failing but the look of the real elements also, as everything - from rocks, to garments to buildings and people - is pristine. No scene takes place in a setting that you would describe as weathered-looking or worn, with every surface looking polished or whole rooms seeming sterile. These choices end up making the sets the feel very much like sets and the spotless costumes feel like costumes. Compounded with scenes being lit very flat and uniformly, the world never feels real enough to fall in to. Wakanda's place as the battlefield with Thanos was given a skeleton crew dress rehearsal in the final act, as Wakanda's forces combat an insurgency. Hopefully, the all-round computer effects will be at least average, which would be several steps improved than what was on display here. Given that the showdown takes place away from a major metropolitan centre unlike almost all its fellow comic movies, it is possible the strong flat lighting in the open fields made the effect less, well, effective. When the compositing was shaky, the problem was compounded by the pure CG additions, like the war Rhinos. Looking more like they belong in the stampede from the original Jumanji, begs the question where all the money went in the 200-million-dollar budget. At no point do they seem real, which in a sense means the Rhinos are at least consistent with the rest of the effects. Perhaps the effects here were undercooked to allow more work on the Infinity War renderings and effects.<br/><br/>Marvel's other significant element is its comedy which Coogler deploys more ably and more sparingly than some of his recent counterparts. Most of the best laughs come from either Serkis's manic performance or Boseman's flat composure as king momentarily lifting. When Boseman appeared in Civil War he was a fresh lively element, here Coogler has him playing it too stoically, turning him in to a blank slate. Beyond flashing his perfect grin, there is little emotion for him to work with, no real intensity to tap in to. Boseman, as does practically every member of the cast, performs solidly with what's given, it's just that what's given to them is often uninspired. Letitia Wright, playing T'Challa's little sister Shuri, plays the role closet to a comedic relief as a stand in Q - creating new tech, weapons and armour. Not all of it lands but there's nothing particularly egregious about it either - minus her one or two racist remarks. Given the highly promoted segregation of the production it is perhaps unsurprising that there are direct, actual racist moments in the films political messaging. These range from claiming that history museums are, essentially, active crime scenes full of stolen possessions (such as 7th century farm equipment) or to a chamber full of African people silencing Martin Freeman as his whiteness prohibits him from speaking. It is played off with a joke, but he never gets to actually speak. If inclusivity is the message you want to broadcast, moments like these run counter to it.<br/><br/>Certain character motivations towards to the third act become wafer thin, bordering on illogical. Particularly when T'Challa is accused of a failing without ever explaining his view of what actually happened, causing the accuser to betray his friend of decades in an instant. Another major illogical choice is regarding the means of the Black Panthers powers - on the site of the meteor impact a flower grows which, when ground up and drank, gives the consumer the powers of the Black Panther. The issue comes in that only one person ever drank it at any one time. Surely a war faring people, as the entire world was thousands of years ago, would have dispensed this drink amongst the ranks and conquered the world. Perhaps just dispense it to the Wakanda Guard to ensure the borders are truly impenetrable. The situation is partially resolved by the films end but the with Infinity War seemingly staging a decent time in Wakanda (if not the films finale) the existence of a dispensable superpower potion should logically play in to that. <br/><br/>All in all, Black Panther is an averagely written, mostly well directed, well-acted, horribl"

And for those that say that they felt ""this movie attacked them"" which from what I've seen there was literally one scene where they brought up the HISTORY of what the ""colonizers"" did in Africa. I don't understand how feelings get hurt over facts. Overall it's a great movie, a lot of people think so, I'd definitely see it again.

"brailsford","6","4","8","26 February 2018"," An acceptable movie, but not deserving the Praise it gets.
","It's understandable given the month it came out that it would get a little bit of an ""inflated score"" but ""Best Comic book movie ever"" is just being silly. This movie has things for the comic book fan and delivers action, the problem is though, it's just ok, doesn't make the character any more interesting then he ever was. Ant Man made a character who is historically not likeable into an interesting character. Black Panther remains an ""out of touch"" with real people superhero. Yeah there are others like that, but how many super heros are also rulers of a secret super advance nation. Iron had issues with his drinking, relationship problems, issues with his dad. Hulk had anger issues, fear of abandonment. Heck even thor had a heck of a lot of relatable family problems. This hero is a natural warrior destined to be king, his dad was already taken out in civil war so it begins with him taking over as king, he is bestowed super human strength and reflex and has a super advanced costume. Heck even Spider-Man homecoming Peter had relatable problems so its not about starting wearing the mantle. <br/><br/>The plot being cookie cutter didn't help either, the villain being obvious villain up til the reveal of the less obvious main villain being still pretty obvious. In the end this movie doesn't really add anything necessary for the series or even interesting to the mcu. <br/><br/>That said movie wasn't really awful... it just didn't deliver all the hype promised. If you must watch everything MCU, it's not going to be terrible, it won't likely be your favorite film though,"

Everything about it is amazing, the seamless transition between African traditions and crazy new technology was outstanding. Erik Killmonger is the greatest Marvel villain now, and not because he's hot, but because he made excellent points and made you question whose side was right. The character growth T'Challa had made me feel like a proud Soccer Mom. Don't even get me started on Shuri or any of the other beautiful and amazingly talented ladies in this film. I swear I fell in love about 50 times watching the movie. Overall, the best Marvel movie and my current topic of conversation for the next 5 months. The only thing that could use improvement is how behind Wakanda is on memes. My only parting remark is that I would put my life on the line for this movie and any of the characters could kill me and I would come back as a ghost to thank them. Ok, that's it."

","I think for you to understand black panther you should have to resonate with its storyline and underlying tones. This is one of the best movies ever written, from the boko haram and chibok girls, to the constant unity and division from African black and African-Americans which is clearly visible on black twitter. Touches on quite a few African cultures showing the diversity of the beautiful continent and how even though there is remarkable difference the fears and goals that drive us are virtually the same. Highly recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in the racial dynamics and the post effects of war and colonisation"

","As a comic book movie, Black Panther represents a rare feat - something that stands on its own without franchise tie-ins or guest heroes, something that works as both drama and adventure without going too dark, something that manages to be about something without ever slowing down. I could have complained about the plot's predictability...but I was too damn busy enjoying it. As a social moment, Black Panther represents something pretty unique too. Not to overstate things, but I have literally never been to a movie theater with this much palpable energy and anticipation. The whole place was ready and waiting for a different kind of superhero movie. But even with ALL the hype, the movie managed to surpass expectations. Put simply: this film was special."

Watch the movie for yourself and decide for yourself whether you like or dislike the film. I understand people who just did not care for this genre, fine I get that, but if you are doing this because of some predisposed thinking then go back to you ignorant holes where you come from!

","The leading hero of this next instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe made his first appearance in Captain America: Civil War, his solo movie is seen as an important superhero movie, opening the door to black leading heroes, directed by Ryan Coogler (Creed). Basically centuries ago, five African tribes war over a meteorite containing vibranium, one warrior ingests a ""heart-shaped herb"" affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities, becoming the first ""Black Panther"". He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of Wakanda, the Wakandans use the vibranium to develop advanced technology and pose as a Third World country to isolate themselves from the world. In 1992, King T'Chaka (John Kani) visits his undercover brother N'Jobu (Sterling K. Brown) in Oakland, California. T'Chaka accuses N'Jobu of assisting black-market arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) with stealing vibranium from Wakanda. N'Jobu's partner reveals he is Zuri (Denzel Whitaker), another undercover Wakandan, and confirms T'Chaka's suspicions. In the present day, following the death of T'Chaka, his son T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns to Wakanda to assume the throne, and to become the next Black Panther. Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), T'Challa's ex-lover from an undercover assignment, Okoye (Danai Gurira), the leader of the Dora Milaje regiment, his mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett) and younger sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) all attend the coronation. At the ceremony, the Jabari Tribe's leader M'Baku (Winston Duke) challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat, T'Challa defeats M'Baku and convinces him to yield rather than die. After Klaue and Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens (Michael B. Jordan) steal a Wakandan artifact from a museum, T'Challa's friend and Okoye's lover W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) urges him to bring Klaue back dead or alive. T'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia travel to Busan, South Korea where Klaue plans to sell the artifact to CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman), a firefight breaks out and Klaue tries to escape, T'Challa catches him, he reluctantly allows Ross to take him into custody. Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image is a front for a technologically advanced civilization, Erik attacks and extracts Klaue, Ross is severely protecting Nakia, T'Challa decides to save Ross rather than pursuing Klaue, taking him to Wakanda. While Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri (Forest Whitaker) about N'Jobu, Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world and take it over. As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, N'Jobu attacked Zuri, forcing T'Chaka to kill him, they covered up the fact that they had left behind N'Jobu's American son, Erik, who became a U.S. black ops soldier. Meanwhile Killmonger, aka N'Jadaka, kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda, he stands before the tribe elders, revealing his identity and claiming to be the true heir to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat; after killing Zuri, he defeats T'Challa and hurls him over a waterfall. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb, Killmonger orders the rest are incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first, supported by W'Kabi and his army, Killmonger prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons around the world. Nakia, Shuri, Ramonda and Ross go to the Jabari Tribe for help, there they find T'Challa who was rescued and is in a coma, he is healed by Nakia's herb. T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit and commands W'Kabi and his army to attack T'Challa. Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje join T'Challa, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and takes down the planes carrying the vibranium weapons, M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down, T'Challa fights Killmonger in Wakanda's vibranium mine, Killmonger's suit is disrupted and T'Challa stabs him, Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated. T'Challa establishes an outreach center at the building where N'Jobu died to be run by Nakia and Shuri, and T'Challa appears before the United Nations to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world. In a post-credits sequence, Shuri is with Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) who is in recuperation. Also starring Florence Kasumba as Ayo and Stan Lee as Thirsty Gambler. Boseman is a good choice as the hero, Jordan is a fairly good villain, and there is great support from Wright, Gurira, Serkis, Freeman and others, most putting on convincing South African or American accents, the story is maybe a little complicated at times, but there enough exciting chase and explosive sequences, filled with fantastic special effects, to keep you engaged, and it is also a good exploration of African culture, a worthwhile superhero action adventure. It won the Oscars for Best Original Score for Ludwig GÃ¶ransson, Best Costume Design and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Song for ""All the Stars"" (also won the Golden Globe), Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing, it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score. Very good!"

","First off, Wakanda is a marvel. The people there are living in 2038 in terms of technology but ironically the world thinks it's a third world country. That sets the scene for the entire movie. The story is about how a young king seeks to right the wrongs of his father and his father before him. It's an intriguing story mixed with humor at just the right times. The music is fantastic and the costume is even more so. Great performances all around and Michael B. Jordan (Killmonger) totally nailed it. He was amazing.

Knowing that I still say that the overall image quality was bland, impressive only when presenting some great visions such as Wakanda city.<br/><br/>Not being overwhelmed by the visual bombardment, it was easier to focus on what was actually said and what was actually happening. And I was disappointed. Interesting social commentary went largely undeveloped. Content-WISE, ""Black Panther"" is a kid's movie, and not particalularly refined at that. Dialogue was stock and characters largely cardboard.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed, to my surprise, of the cast. Chadwick Boseman, in particular. He is a tremendously gifted actor, but took T'Challa so seriously, that it became stilted. His slow reading of the lines alone made any resonance on the comical register impossible. Michael B. Jordan fared much better, but the character motivations for him were a bit confusing. Andy Serkis did a very good job with his ridiculous character. In the end, Martin Freeman was for the umpteenth time the best actor in a movie he appears in, without really getting his due share of the raves.<br/><br/>Coogler directs fluently, but, for example, the inauguration challenge fight was noticeably clunky. Also, this being a Marvel movie, most of what you see on the screen is actually CGI, or CGI enhanced (those rhinos really don't work). So you're watching an animation, basically. And it doesn't look that good. And, this being a Disney production, the lack of blood is incredible. There is a scene, where a person's throat is slit with a sword, and not a drop of blood is seen. If you can't show blood, don't shoot such scenes.<br/><br/>I honestly don't quite know what to say about ""Black Panther"", I was so much anticipating a better and more different movie. ""BlacKKKlansman"" is a far, far better movie about similar themes. ""Black Panther"" needed a more experienced filmmaker to pull it through."

There was some very cringey lines and nonsensical plot threads but overall it works. There were parts that were purely inserted political statements and a super hero action film is hardly the place for Hollywood to try and make some grand social statement but that doesn't seem to stop them these days. Acting was fine for the most part.<br/><br/>All in all it was thoroughly forgettable and I can't imagine me going back for a second watch.

","Black Panther is the story of a king with super powers whose throne gets questioned by someone who sees themselves as the rightful heir to the throne. Chadwick Boseman plays T'Challa in this film who is the King of wakanda, an African Country that is hidden by technology. Michael B. Jordan plays a kid a kid from California, Erik Killmonger, who believes that he has been cheated from the throne and decides that he will challenge T'Challa for it. These characters both want to prove they are not possers of the power and are not pushovers.
This movie was fairly entertaining, it had very good visual effects and fun action scenes. The movie just didn't hit that big not for me that it seemed to by everyone else. I had fun watching the film but I didn't think that it was great in anysense if the matter. The story seemed like a very played out of a man who thinks he should be king so he fights the king for it, just with superpowers. It was fun but again just not the best superhero film of the year or the past couple of years.
This movie came out early last year following the huge buzz that was Captain America: Civil War, where the Black Panther was introduced. The movie didn't need to be another origin story and it wasn't so I give props to the filmmakers for that part of it. I just do not see how this movie got nominated for an oscar, all of the performances were fine, the dialogue was fine and the story was fine.
All aspects of this film were done great, I believe with the script that the movie had it did the best it could on every level. The editing and sound were put together well to create seamless scenes and fights. All of the dialogue seemed real, for the most part. Not that the lines weren't written well, but the film takes place in an African Country and have been in that country forever, advancing far past the world, and staying hidden, but they all speak english. This is something that bothers me in a lot of movies, it might be very convenient but why don't they speak some African language, they have accents. Even the tribe that lives up into the mountains who seem to be a little primitive, when looking at how far they have advanced looking at how the other tribes have, they speak english as well throughout the film. Other than that though technically this film is very well done.
Going through and watching this film There was a scene that I really enjoyed, the scene in which Erik challenges T'Challa for his throne. The scene takes place in the throne room, Erik is taken into the the room where he is being prosecuted. Only to find out that his has rights to be the King of Wakanda and the Black Panther. The camera use in this scene is very minimal, just cuts to who is talking going back and forth. It is a very common technique used to just show what everyone's thinking and feeling and that was probably the best way to go with this scene as what was happening was shocking a lot of people so all of their emotions. There is nothing notable about the lighting, the scene is in a room with a big window during the day so you can see everyone's face well. What I like about this scene is something that has been done a million times over is the build up with music until you find out what Erik was hiddining from them when he revealed his blood right and that he wanted to be the king. Just a simple build up in music before that delivery was done well. The pacing in this scene was fun to watch everything seemed fine and going a nice pace, then once they start to exchange information back and forth the camera cuts begin to speed up. From this scene which has no action you can see that on a technical aspect there are zero problems with this film. Another problem this film didn't have was acting, there was an all star cast. Everyone does really well to make their character believable and give true emotions for what is happening and what might happen for them in the future.
I have only seen this film three times, in the theaters, once when I caught it on tv and when I just rewatched it this week to give a review, I do not have that big of a problem with the film, I am not a big fan of it though, as I have said I think that there are better superhero films, even better redemption films, which is a big element of this movie.
With all of these different grips with the movie i do not want to give the impression that I hate this movie, just a tad bit overrated. I enjoyed it for the most part and if you like the films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe than you would probably enjoy this film as well. If i was tot give this a film a rating from one to ten I would say 6/10. It was good on a technical scale but it was an overused story."

After the death of the king young T' Challa(Chadwick Boseman) is faced with the test of putting his country and family first against the world. His own nation is high tech and as the new king fractions of family and war with sibling rival make this film somewhat of an interesting drama with a good turn from Michael B. Jordan.

The kid from Get Out was terrible in this - it felt like he just got thrown in the movie because he was in Get Out and not because he was truly the right choice for the movie. It's almost like he was smirking throughout the film. Someone else would have been better in this.

I don't think he has much range and while everyone else seemed to do well with the accent - he sounded like he couldn't do it. <br/><br/>I usually love Martin Freeman but he was so bland in this.<br/><br/>I do not think this is deserving of all the accolades.

"jwyattr","5","2","3","4 July 2018"," Wait for a Rental
","I would like to iterate that I am a massive MCU and Black Panther fan, so when I saw the first trailer I was fairly hyped for this film, though not overly so because I've learned not to overhype films because of experiences like Jupiter Ascending. As more trailers went on I began to become less and less excited for the movie, so much so that I didn't even see it in theatres, it simply failed to capture my interest.<br/><br/>Having watched the film now, I can no confirm that my assumption was correct; this was a prodigiously dull Marvel film, moreso than Thor: The Dark World, and I actually liked that movie more than this.<br/><br/>There were some aspect of the picture that I enjoyed, so I shall get that out of the way first. Andy Serkis as Klaue was a blast to watch, he was the most entertaining and had the most energy when performing, though in hindsight his role was ultimately pointless, as he is killed off very early on in the movie (though that did take a long time, the movie is exceptionally lengthy).
I enjoyed Martin Freeman as the CIA agent, his American accent was prettu believable and his acting was quite good. Some of the CGI was masterfully crafted, I especially enjoyed the backdrop of Wakanda itself, particularly the sand hologram things that the characters used to survey the landscape and communicate.
I generally enjoyed the first half more than the second half, the CGI was better in that section and the action scenes had considerably more energy to them (though I did dislike the car chase scene in Seoul).<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman was passable in the film, I liked him more in Civil War than here, he's very weak, despite having been given extreme upgrades in terms of his weaponry and armor, perhaps he got to arrogant and slacked off? He somehow gets beaten by a man whose only combat training is American Armed forces training, as opposed to Black Panther, who is rigourously trained in African hand to hand combat. There should be no true reason that he lost to Killmonger at any point in the movie, save for the climax when Killmonger obtains a suit of his own.<br/><br/>As the for the cons, they are very numerous and very glaring.
First off, the accents are grating. I understand that they are nescessary to establish the world in which the film takes place, but the actors' accents start out mildly offputting to earbleedingly annoying, particularly Forest Whitaker, who sounds like the most stereotypical African man possible (which I hate to say, because I love Forest Whitaker). <br/><br/>Aside from Klaue and Martin Freeman, all the other character are devoid of any sort of trait that is likable or even warrant of any remembrance. Black Panther himself goes through the typical hero tropes, where he starts out winning, loses, discovers something terrible about his own family, and suffers through a painfully obvious fake death sequence. Okoye, BP's second-in-command is your standard stern warrior who manages to get through every combat sequence unscathed, despite using a spear. Granted she was against henchmen who mistook their handguns for blugeoning weapons, but the point still stands. Lupita N'yongo, who I normally adore, was forgettable, so much so that I only vaguely remember her connection to BP. BP's genius, Q-esque sister who makes all his gear was especially annoying, she had a few funny lines, but everytime she came into the camera I began dreading what annoying thing she would do or say next.<br/><br/>However, all these gripes pale in comparison to my least favorite character, that being Erik Killmonger, our supposed tragic villain of the story. I can understand that losing his father was traumatic, but his motivation is meant to paint him as some sort of tragic antihero who is doing the wrong things for the right reasons. I can say this, the film certainly did do a good job at making me hate the villain, as he was essentially advocating an African Ethnostate, which makes him incredibly irredeemable in my eyes. I normally find Michael B. Jordan to be an exceptional actor, but I found his to be, at worst boring, and at worst astonishingly painful to watch, particularly when he is supposed to be angry (it ends up being hilarious, but not in a good way). I found his final monologue before his well deserved death to be patronizing and preachy to the point of being incredibly vapid and self serving. It's almost as if you could see the director sitting in the background giving himself a big ol' pat on the back for something that doesn't need to be said and is fairly obvious to any decent human being.<br/><br/>Overall, Black Panther was even more of a disappointment than I thought it would be, I already had a feeling that it was going to be overhyped, but I was unpleasantly shocked by what I was given. I didn't hate this movie outright, there were parts that I enjoyed, but the pros are far outweighed by the cons, which are just far too important and integral to enjoyment of this movie that it renders any good things about the movie negligable. I admire the filmmakers intentions, and I understand that no movie is easy to make and there is effort put into the film, which I suppose makes its failures all the more disappointing. The plot was like a minefield of clichÃ©s, which the writers a suicidal man with a metal detector doing everything in his power to step on every single one. The acting was a mixed bag and the CGI was good at first, but debilitated into a cartoon by the end (the final fight between Black Panther and Killmonger was especially abysmal and campy).<br/><br/>In the end, all I can say is that if you like the movie, good on you, I admire your ability to find joy in something that I cannot. If you disliked the movie, I hope that some of my criticisms struck a chord with you."

","Let's start w/the positives. In the car chase scene (of course there had to be one) were a couple of sequences that were kind of cool. Also good to see a bit of African culture w/neck rings, lip plates & scarification. 
On the down side I was hoping to see great scenes from Africa, but instead got Georgia, USA; Korea; Argentina. 
Dialogue was typical teen level oversimplification so as not to scare the audience away or invoke brain freeze. 
Acting, unfortunately, was too rote memorization school technique. 
Action, fight sequences - same old, same old unimaginative kicks/swings w/wire tosses through the air. Car chases. Yes, boring. 
For tech we have a futuristic aircraft that made the so overused & unreal swooshing sound accompanied by the usual looks cool design, but aerodynamically would fail a middle school science class. Don't get me started on super metal, as every element we know of in the Universe has already been seen and would have already been on dear old Earth. Invisible domed city? Hasn't that already been used in several movies. Then there's the typical basement/behind a nondescript door research lab for super weapons. 
Costumes! The trend in Hollywood has always been for some fashion person holed up for life in their cubby hole making showy non-functional synthetic costumes for sy-fy/fantasy movie look always the same. 
Plot - evil family members (or corporate or government) to take over the world. Magic curing potions; hallucinatory dream sequences. Ugghhhh!"
"CountJonnie","5","2","3","20 May 2018"," A movie that feels irritatingly slow and rushed at the same time.
","A Black Panther movie was inevitable, after the appearance of this titular hero in a Cap. America movie. Chadwick Boseman breathes life in a charismatic way, into this character who brings class in the MCU, being a hero, but also a king of the beautiful country of Wakanda. These are the only redeeming qualities of this movie that is otherwise a stinker and shows that the MCU has more failures than just Incredible Hulk and Inhumans.<br/><br/>Black Panther is about T'Challa who takes the mantle as a king, unites various tribes, hides from the world and comes to oppose a villain in Killraven, who wants to expose Wakanda to the world, and use vibranium as revenge for years of oppression and abuse against his ancestors. T'Challa has to face this challenge and make peace with his own ancestor's mistakes at the same time.<br/><br/>I can't see how this movie has high ratings. Besides Boseman and Freeman, there is not a single decent actor in this movie. The acting is horrible. Andy Serkis is trying, but his overacting gets annoying after a few minutes. Michael B. Jordan has showed the worst of acting in Creed and FF, and repeats this here, unable to convince the viewer of his nature and motivations. Other characters were random and rushed, so they couldn't fill the holes. Because of this, the movie never engages, making this feel slow from the beginning to the end.<br/><br/>The effects were slightly entertaining but also over-used. The suit is never interesting, the way they did with Iron Man. Vibranium is rich and interesting, but never treated with the respect it deserves. And the action is so random, fast and CGI heavy, that it never convinces or entertains. It just confuses and makes this movie feel rushed. The mixing of slow-paced and fast-paced makes the movie feel uninteresting and unbalanced.<br/><br/>Wakanda is as beautiful as a fairytale brought to life. But that can't save the other mistakes that turn this movie into a stinker."

"Thrashman88","4","2","3","17 May 2018"," Please Wake Me UP After It's Over
","I'm still puzzled at the amazing Box Office success of ""Black Panther"". I was looking forward to watching this movie as soon as it came out on Blu-ray. Finally, last weekend me and my family watched it. The veredict? Very nice eye candy but I never felt ANYTHING for ANY of the characters on the screen. The only one who had some sort of ""life"" was Andy Serkis character, but he was gone way too early. The plot is contrived at best, something 13 year old kids will definitely have trouble with. It was nice seeing Danai Gurira (The Walking Dead) in a prominent role, although she basically apes what she does in TWD.
Halfway through the movie I fell asleep, literally, just waking up some 20 odd minutes before the end.
Either I'm becoming too old (which is a fact) or movies of this nature are becoming a bore. I'd like to thing it's the second, cause I enjoy mostly sci-fi/fantasy/horror fare over any other genre. Plus, I still enjoy kids movies like ""Coco"" or ""Ferdinand"" very much. I think there's been an over saturation of things Marvel in recent years, even more so than Star Wars stuff. To top it all, comic wise, I don't recall ever hearing of a hero named ""Black Panther"", unlike Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk or Spider-man.<br/><br/>One thing's for sure. The FX are marvelous and so is the sound mix, so this is the perfect movie to show off your new home theater system. Other than that, stay clear off this one!"

"lentalsoup","5","2","3","12 May 2018"," It really is rather average.
","Here's why ""Black Panther"" is incredible:<br/><br/>1) It's a cultural movement and it is about time. 
There is understandably a lot of hype because it is a mainstream-marketed superhero movie that features an mainly black cast. This shows that Hollywood finally acknowledges that they should cater to everyone on the market and is a indicator of the significant changes society has gone through and the representation in this movie is an absolute gem to witness.<br/><br/>2) It seeks out stereotypes and breaks them. 
In lieu with being a cultural movement, it is a Hollywood movie that finally presents African countries in a positive light while also dispelling myths of tribes being backwards, as well as some mystic being ""all-knowing"" because they're so in touch with nature. Letitia Wright's character, Shuri, is the biggest breaker of stereotypes here, but a special shout-out to making Forest Whitaker's character, Zuri, more than your standard ""mystic man"" as well.<br/><br/>3) The costume and set design was literal art. 
Kudos to the costume department for thinking through the symbolism of every tribe and person represented and for having their vision for each character (even background or minor ones) shine through.<br/><br/>4) Shuri, General Okoye and Killmonger. 
They stole the show. King who? Black Panther who? All of the actors were actually pretty good, but Letitia Wright, Danai Gurira and Michael B. Jordan were exceptionally good. Actually, every single character felt decidedly more interesting to follow than T'Challa. I now wish I had gone to see a ""Nakia: Super Warrior Liberator Spy"" movie rather than Black Panther.<br/><br/>
Now here's why Black Panther is an average movie at best and counting its cultural significance as a positive:<br/><br/>1) Its protagonist is literally the driest and most bland character in the movie. 
Despite Chadwick Boseman being a good actor, he wasn't given much to work with. I don't remember T'Challa's struggle nor his character progression in this movie, because he was written with only one apparent struggle but nothing that seemed deep enough that a day's worth of contemplation for T'Challa couldn't fix. In the movie, T'Challa's character is mostly used as a tool to clash against Michael B. Jordan's incredible work as Killmonger. It does not do well to have a superhero movie where we can't even remember the struggle of the title character.<br/><br/>2) The story is bad.
The story in this movie is so bland, predictable and it doesn't even offer any kind of resolution. The movie has so many world issues it wants to address, but never quite manages to do anything besides skim the very surface of and not even that goes well. It tries to highlight that Killmonger seeks revenge on the whole world for slavery and imperialism; but then never really addresses its complexities, the effect it has had on history nor does it explore the morale behind Killmonger's vision ever again (you get a cop-out to this issue if you stay for the after-credits scene or watch Infinity War). It tries to address that Wakanda is a prosperous nation with its own privileges and yet the nation doesn't help its own neighbors; the movie then also never addresses this issue again, except for offering said cop-out in the after-credits scene. It tries to address the issue of many African tribes being hung up on tradition as a hindrance; then also never addresses this issue again. Everything is left hanging in the air and there is never really a resolve. This is a superhero movie, we expect a resolution of some sort, even if that resolution has a negative impact.<br/><br/>3) It's not even a good superhero movie.
While I appreciate my drawn-out and serious dramas, I went in expecting a superhero movie. I felt like I showed up, prepared for entertainment and was rewarded with... a kind of cool scene action scene at the end? Sadly, it wasn't even when our protagonist was fighting the antagonist in the inevitable last standoff, it was when our beloved General Okoye was on the battlefield. With the exception of Shuri and General Okoye not much of this movie felt remotely superhero-like. I would not have held this against a movie normally, but if I'm expecting a superhero movie, I actually want to see some really cool action scenes. It's like they promised me James Bond and I got some dweeby half-limp noodle CIA operative (Wait, Martin Freeman's character, is that you?).<br/><br/>4) The CGI.
It's just bad. They overused it and whenever Chadwick Boseman was presented as Black Panther, I had a slight PSTD flashback of watching Legolas jump on stones in mid-air in The Hobbit.<br/><br/>5) The writing is horrible.
Except for a few one-liners (you get a pun or two besides what is shown in the trailer) the writing feels stunted and weird. It just feels very off, even with the added filter of me understanding that I am a European and thus ""out of the loop"" in terms of how the cadence of jokes or tonal use of African languages (I think it was Xhosa?) usually is delivered. The dialogue is what makes this movie forgettable: There is sensation of a real struggle between any characters except for in Killmonger's case. They could have played on the struggle between General Okoye's duty to her country opposed to her love for Daniel Kaluuya's character, W'Kabi. They could have highlighted Shuri's frustrations of elders looking down on her nontraditional way of life, they could have shown more of the struggle that Winston Duke's character, M'Baku and his tribe has gone through. There were so many missed opportunities and while many things can be derived by context and implicit meaning, the language used between the characters never felt right. This resulted in a general feeling of indifference and I would have felt no inclination to be on Wakanda's side, had it not been for Shuri and General Okoye (and even Lupita Nyong'o's character, Nakia, has me feeling a bit skeptical).<br/><br/>Overall, I understand the hype and the significance of this movie, but it is not a good superhero movie. The cast, crew (except for a select few: I'm looking at you, CGI-folks) and score has done an amazing job but somehow the writers have done them dirty and it has resulted in an overall forgettable movie."

","Though I would LOVE to get into the sociopolitical connotations of this obvious ""token"" effort towards its obviously token character I, unlike Marvel Studios, am aware of what is appropriate and what is not. Marvel comics have been force-feeding ridiculous ethnic transformations of age old, sacred iconic characters down their fans' throats in lieu of creating new ones and steadily losing their fanbase. With sociopolitically injected efforts like this and the casting of a dark girl as Valkyrie in Thor: Ragnarok, and the new interracial love interest in Spider-Man: Homecoming, it looks like Marvel Studios is determined to follow suit. Was this film meant to evolve the character, or simply to placate the misrepresented? Because this ""made for tv"" quality theatrical release seemed as much of a ""token"" to the Marvel lineup as the character Token is to South Park. Rather than fill a crucial vacancy in our culture this effort seems more like salt in a wound. I'd expect significantly more from Marvel Studios since the ONLY reason they ever got off the ground to begin with was off the strength of a black character named BLADE. Anyone remember those films?

The director insulted all African people with this, the message was very clear . Even if Africans have resources and high level life, the still will be savages who will prefer traditions over rationality. You can have a great capacities but if you don't belong to a real family (discrimination) and don't win the fight you don't deserve to lead a nation. If the winner of the fight is a real savage the people will have to follow him no matter what. This is contradictory if you want to present Wakanda as a advanced culture.

It doesn't differentiate any way between all grandiloquent Marvel movies. Concept it self is quite ok, but the story itself is so boring and lame. Technically Black Panther is well done and it looks great on screen, but use of 3D is just nonsense. Even it is great to see a superhero movie with just black actors, the conclusion feels too underline and pointing, which hardly is what the makers wanted.<br/><br/>Movie also feels too vain and clearly it has just made to underlay upcoming Avengers movie. It only purpose is to introduce new character to audience, so they don't have to do it at Avengers movie.<br/><br/>Black Panthers massive budget of 200 million dollars gives you some beautiful scenery but nothing else. Stan Lee makes his cameo in this movie and that feels the most funniest part of the movie.<br/><br/>Visually Black Panther is guaranteed Marvel production.

The movie briefly touches on a wide variety of issues and then just kind of leaves them there. And the worst thing about the movie is that, for me, it isn't even really clear who the good guy is. I accept that movies can have ambiguous ideas to make the audience question who the protagonist is, but the thing is, this shouldn't be the case for 99% of types of superhero movies. If the story was any better, not having a clear good guy would actually be a good thing. But it isn't.<br/><br/>For me, overall, skip it."
"tkell31","5","2","3","26 February 2018"," Decent movie buried under the agenda
","I think there's a decent movie buried in the gigantic pity party about how badly white people treat black people. And I'm not exaggerating about the scope of the pity party. Right from the start and repeatedly throughout whites are hammered for everything from slavery to the current state of affairs in Africa. I guess they single out white people since that is the only group that has shown a lot of guilt about it. Certainly blacks fared far far worse in non-white countries, but that doesnt sell tickets or gain political clout. It's odd they are so political in a movie that is otherwise a complete fairy tale centered around this all powerful, all benevolent black country that ironically most closely resembles the United States than anything else. Too bad, the pity party takes away from a good storyline and some amazing effects."

Everything in this movie just feels like it came straight from a checklist, but if you are okay with that, then this movie is fine. When I left the theater, I felt apathetic. I wasn't disappointed but I certainly wasn't surprised. As I said, you get what you come for. If you care about specifics, keep reading, if not, just know that it is like every other Marvel movie.<br/><br/>Plot: If you saw a trailer or even read the IMDB plot synopsis, you have spoiled the movie for yourself. 5 minutes into the movie you can guess where the plot will go, beat by beat. There are no twists, no turns, just your formulaic safe ""go here, beat some guys up, talk, go there, beat some guys up, talk, etc."" If you are fine with a predictable plot (will the main character die 15 minutes into the movie?! What?! He doesn't!) then this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>Effects: While the art design for this movie is frankly beautiful, the effects are far from. The whole movie feels like it was shot on green screen and some effects are cringe worthy. I am talking about PS2 cutscene levels of bad. Nothing feels real and there is no tension in anything. <br/><br/>Characters, pacing, cinematography, basically everything else:The characters are 2 dimensional (the stoic main character, funny smart girl, stoic bodygaurd, wack villain, serious villain who is the antithesis of the main protagonist). The style is ""marvel movie"". Take it or leave it. <br/><br/>Politics?:There seems to be a misconception that this movie in any way deals with politics. While that is technically true, the issues are handled wit the grace of ""should we kill all white people?"" ""probably not"". There are so many political issues addressed by this movie, isolationism, racism, traditions, etc. but all of them are presented in the fashion of ""(insert topic here) is (good/bad)"".

I'm not a Black Panther aficionado, but likewise I was no Iron Man, Blade, Avengers et al aficionado yet I loved those movies.<br/><br/>Black Panther was excellently done all around: the story, the acting, the action and the atmosphere it looked like time and effort was put into it. Everything looked authentic. I appreciated the atmosphere more than anything. Set in the fictitious land of Wakanda, hidden in the heart of Africa, it had such an authentic feel. They were able to portray this beautiful African nation in a way that showed it's difference from what we're but showing it in a dignified respectful manner. The scenery, the people, the atmosphere didn't look cheap, gimmicky or like a caricature. They came off like real people from a real culture.<br/><br/>And the story was layered and complex. It wasn't simply revenge or lunacy and it definitely wasn't black and white. There were some real ideological issues and battles in there with no right answer. Of course the action sequences were on point but that's to be expected. I'm just thrilled that it lived up to the hype."

If the goal was to make a film relegated to the pile of forgotten and unwatchable movies in under a decade, it was a success. What makes this one worse than most Marvel films; however, is the terrible writing. I am going to focus there because the acting was actually really great from all involved with even a few standouts from Jordan and Wright. One example ought to do. How can you tell me this ""kingdom"" is the safeguard of easily the most advanced technologies on earth and yet they decide their kingdom's ruler by hero death match?!?!?!

","There is no denying that Black Panther is an extremely important film, being a mainstream superhero movie with a mostly black cast that has good things to say. However, this does not excuse it from the major problems it contains.<br/><br/>I have never been so thoroughly able to predict the plot of a movie before. This is not to say that most Marvel movies don't have predictable plots, but with this one, it is more blatantly obvious than any other in the series. It is also not aided by the fact that it has a boring protagonist in a movie where every other character is more interesting than he is. Because he has no real enticement as the lead, it quickly reveals the other problems more readily than other Marvel movies as you are paying more attention to them.<br/><br/>The only part of this film that really deserves the praise it got is Killmonger. He is a great villain, the most interesting character in the movie, and has some really worthy things to say. But he cannot save the entire movie, which is so generally mediocre.

","It took me quite a while to watch this one, as I didn't feel it would add something of substance to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, plus the fact that it was extremely over-hyped and I happen to dislike Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan's horrendous acting abilities. The filmmakers even misused Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman; to spoil two such great actors tells you something about this movie. I wasn't surprised, really; I expected this movie to be boring and unappealing to me. I tried to get pass all of those unfavourable things and just enjoy the film, because if it's at least silly entertainment with zero depth or interesting storytelling, then at least it accomplishes the entertainment factor, which is a good thing. Having said that, there were moments in which I found myself interested and involved, but those moments were few and faded away pretty quickly. Even the action I found it dull, nothing that could raise an eyebrow. The only thing I thought it was okay was the CGI, which I've seen a lot of people in here criticize. Whenever there were scenes of the tech used in Wakanda, I though the special effects were very well done.
I couldn't feel absolutely anything for these characters. Had they all died in the end, I wouldn't have been shocked or even cared at all. Michael B. Jordan as a villain was an utter joke, totally forced and unbelievable.<br/><br/>I think Black Panther actually IS a cool character, but I dislike the way the actor has portrayed T'Challa, and to have a heavily criticized origin movie sort of creates an stigma for the character in my opinion. Although one could argue that it definitely has something to do with the masses and social media, because the hype was created by the people, the ""fans"". And fans disguised as ""journalists"" posting about the movie on every site and on social media. Believe it or not all of this influences how many people view this character and his universe.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie wasn't very good in my opinion, but I did enjoy some parts, so I'm giving it a 5. There are far more people out there with harsher words than mine who won't hesitate in rating it below 5. If there's a sequel, I will be watching for sure, but I'm not expecting much, that's for sure. Suddenly I feel like watching Static Shock or Blade for better outlets of metahumans of African-descent. And to why there are so many people praising this flick as if it was The Dark Knight, it's beyond me."

","This film was very well received and praised by critics on arrival. The cynic in me still believes that the social importance of the film means that many people were willing it to success even before seeing it. To be fair, the film is a good standalone entry in the Marvel universe of films, but at the same time it is still a film in the franchise - not some magically new type of beast. The high percentage of the cast who are black and positive characters is probably the most obvious thing highlighted by the critics, although it does seem like window dressing at times, with the African culture laid on thick on everything. Interestingly, the film reinforces negative images of African-Americans through the view characters from this specific group - not overly so, but enough to notice as it clashes with the main presentation.<br/><br/>Outside of its value as social tool, to show studios yet again that they should not assume what they assume about their mass audience, the film itself is fun, lively and mostly interesting. The plot has good pace and nice developments, although it is not as morally murky as it could have been. Some of the cast do play to this aspect, but the film never really wants to be in a grey area so much as to have clear goodies and baddies. The action sequences are good and play out with the usual humor and high production standards. The cast is well led by Boseman, who has charisma and presence. He is very well supported by a deep cast - with Jordan in particular making a great 'villain'. Ironic in a film praised in America for being a positive challenge to the sort of 'OscarSoWhite' world of Hollywood, that so many of the cast are British but regardless so many people are good here with few weak links.<br/><br/>In the end it is still a Marvel franchise film, and first and foremost it does what this needs and does it well. The social aspects are important, but not while you're watching it - which is fine because it is enjoyable and slick enough to hold the attention and be worth a look."

 The setting of Wakanda was majestic and eye catching. The new technology reflected their advanced society. Once again, the plot did not live up to the setting. The concept and message of the movie was powerful. Black oppression is what created Wakanda, and fueled the tension. It is not unusual for Marvel movies to have a political message, but 'Black Panther's' had a more relevant stance.

","I didn't know what to expect from this movie. Was honestly a bit hesitant to watch it, since I didn't really care for the Black Panther in the Avengers. But after hearing that this site claims that the movie was the best Marvel movie ever, I had to at least watch it. I'm white, so going into a movie with a mostly black cast, I knew it might be a challenge to be unbiased in my review; however, with only a very few exceptions I could almost forget the predominant color of most of the stars. I am going to try to ignore those few exceptions for the rest of this review.<br/><br/>One thing that is very clear after finally watching the movie is that both the 1 star reviews AND the 10 star reviews are clearly wrong. Maybe one happened to offset the other, which is probably the case. Clearly the 10 stars were either people who wanted it to be the best movie, and the 1 stars wanted to balance them out. Whatever the case, this is a middle of the road type of movie. It's not the best movie made, nor is it the worst. If I could have rated this 5.5 stars, I would have. It had such potential to be a very good movie. Had they trimmed about 30 minutes of the more boring (and unnecessary) aspects, it could have easily been a 7.<br/><br/>The good: I liked just about everyone. The action scenes were pretty good. Even the CGI was better than I expected, since the one they show here on this site is awful, but it looked much better in the actual movie. I liked the futuristic city of Wakanda, and T'Challa's sister WAS the highlight most everyone talks about. She should have her own movie. Heck, she could be the Black Panther. <br/><br/>The bad: I can see why there are comparisons to the Lion King. Wakanda is the most developed country in the world, but they actually allow others to battle the heir to the throne? And if they can beat him, they become King? Seriously? So if someone stronger than T'Challa, who is son of their King, beats him, T'Challa is a nobody? And this person who just happens to be stronger now rules the most powerful and developed country in the world? Seriously? I mean this happens not once, but twice in the movie. I actually rolled my eyes when the 2nd one occurred. So this crazy a-hole has a chance to be king, just because his father was brother to the king? Well, I'm pretty sure the guy was a traitor, so that would sever all ties to the kingdom, but I guess that doesn't count? Anymore than Scar killing his brother to become king? This right here lost them a star or two. Having the people of Wakanda, especially their General, agreeing to follow him lost another star. It seemed the only ones who had any sense were T'Challa's mother, sister and his ex-lover Nakia, all three of whom were smarter and more loyal than the lot of them. <br/><br/>Like I said, it had the potential to be at least a 7 star movie, but as it stands, it's no where near as good as any of other Avenger movies...or any other action movie. I could say more, but I think I've made my point."

","The storyline here at imdb is just namesake, because there isn't really a story.<br/><br/>There is tonnes and tonnes of cool tech, atleast 10 times as much as iron man movies, but it felt a little boring(I was surprised myself). At the same time the first iron man, the simple one he built inside the cave, was absolutely glorious.<br/><br/>There is no heart in this movie, filled with people who had no depth. Both iron man and captain america fills you with strength and admiration, while the black panther and his entire group was pretentious and preachy.<br/><br/>Do see it, its not irritating, but go in without expectation.<br/><br/>In the last 30 secs (after credits), they showed something that made me happy. You can look forward to that."
"wilgarris","4","1","1","17 May 2018"," Wonderful movie if you leave any sort of logic at home
","I love comic book movies and this was great but in a any movie has to have some reality to it or there is nothing to overcome. Wakanda, the city is just a rip off of Atlantis. The entire movie is made less believable and immersive by making the nation over the top. The racism in the movie is laughable only because we know that if similar jokes were made at the expense of blacks, there would be outrage and really only show the hypocrisy or ignorance of movie makers. All and all it was a fun movie but it doesn't deserve a place in the MCU. It could have been a better movie."

","So this film for me is as if the lion king was written in the perspective of scar. It's almost like the script of the lion king was a jigsaw and the writers just mashed the prices together. That's the story... Don't get me started on the acting! So all these people are from the same (albeit made up) country, you wouldn't know this from the broadness of the accents. Are we in South Africa? Or Ethiopia? Or Jamaica?! I made the mistake of believing the critics, this is no where near a 10/10 film. But if you know that before you watch you might just enjoy it"

","The description of this movie on IMDB.com summarize the movie. The movie is a cultural enjoyable journey of a super hero.<br/><br/>(Black Panther) the character caught my eyes first time in ""captain America: civil war"" movie, his agility like a panther got me excited to see more of him in this movie. The most of the this movie showcases African visually stunning culture -which I didn't mind watching - and few of modern references specially in US. <br/><br/>There are times I felt that I've been taken away by the visual effects, the set, and the music and forgot to concentrate on the movie plot it self. I will try to be fair as possible as I can.. This movie begins where ""captain America: civil war"" ended, the Wakanda throne is going to be taken by the elder son of the previous king ""black panther"" and little less than third of this movie given to this portion then a threat to Wakanda must be dealt with by the newly crowned king as of his new duties as king ""black panther"".. conflict of the many tribes ruled by the Wakanda's king wasn't raised until the new king arrived and with the new threat, that put lot of responsibilities on the new king.. very simple and straight forward story line but with an addition to a super powered king and country that posses advanced technology that no one have on earth. <br/><br/>Simple plot with most expected spectrum of emotions and enjoyable action and humor."

","Judging this film solely on its entertainment value and in comparison to other films in the MCU and you'll see it's barely serviceable. Black Panther himself was a complete bore. Almost nothing the guy did got a reaction out of me. I was looking forward to Michael B Jordan's performance and I was so disappointed. It was totally one note and uninspired. <br/><br/>The CGI was terrible as well. Watching Black Panther jump around reminded me of Harry Potter in the first film playing Quidditch. And the technology displayed was way too overdone. They could've downplayed it a little.<br/><br/>This will go right along with Iron Man 3 for the weakest films so far in the Marvel Collective."

The movie was despite many lapses were OK. They could have made better origin story, as I didn't see anything of genius level. Everything was as expected. Andy Serkis as Klaw in the movie was looking brilliant and flawless. Though his role was small and he made his mark. The antagonist in the movie also acted well and he was looking menacing. Main hero was also good, and he did his part well. Dialogues were fine but more was expected as you don't expect humour to come out. I just can't believe what the critics loved so much about the movie. Every marvel movie besides last Thor feels like same. I just can't believe how many times they are saving the world or galaxy. These superheroes movies are feeling quite redundant now."
"n-m-bertin","5","1","1","4 May 2018"," I didn't care for the characters.
","Black Panther is a beautiful movie, but I was never IN it. I never felt like Wakanda was real. Who believes such an advanced nation would still not be a democracy ? Or that it was never discovered (even before they had the cloaking technology) ? I think my main concern though is T'Challa. I don't understand him, he's never developed enough. They think his introduction in Civil War is enough... And people seem to praise the villain. Well he has some legitimous concerns for sure, he's basically the audience asking itself ""if Wakanda is so advanced why is it not helping other black people around the world ?"". But he's too much of a show-off with his big muscles and everything. The character of Ross is also very poor. 0 development, he's weak, at no point his position in the CIA is actually earned. <br/><br/>As a movie I understand that it's a milestone for some, just like Luke Cage was. But it is not a reason to overlook the issues plaguing this film. I think it would have been a much better movie if Black Panther was a scientific genius like in the comic, he even evented a science, ""shadow physics"". Here, they split his personality : the genius isn't him, it's his sister. If he were the scientific genius, his place on the Wakanda throne would be much more justified. As is, he's there just because he's the prince. There is a lot of unjustified stuff in the movie. Why is W'Kabi betraying T'Challa ? Why does M'Baku suddenly help ? <br/><br/>Anyway, it was quite boring (because it's long as well) and Wakanda is beautiful but not that impressive, we just see one city. And I'm annoyed that Marvel movies always take place over the course of a couple of days. There's never any room for training, improvement, it's just action/reaction..."

I need to see it once or twice again as there was so much going on per scene to truly catch it all. From the production design to the score to the costume deisgn to the location casting and the fight scene choreography. This film had so much to offer. 10/10 
I for sure, was well entertained"
"snowkist99","10","7","18","22 February 2018"," Incredible movie! 3D made it even better. Captivated from beginning to end.
","I've been excited to see Black Panther for a while but had no idea just how much I'd enjoy it. It's hard to decide which details to praise first. This film was strong but graceful. The fight scenes were intense. In every scene, the visuals had my full attention. Everything from the color schemes of the outfits to the contrast between the real Wakanda and what the outside world sees, was so well thought out. <br/><br/>Hairstyles were so intricate on some characters but the women who didn't have hair wore their baldness so beautifully. Seeing the deep strength of the female characters sent a surge of energy through me. It was nice for once to see women on an equal plain to the men and not to be silenced when speaking boldly. The mixture of high tech/ modern gadgets and tribal outfits/rituals seemed to send a message that holding on to traditions while moving forward is important for strength and survival of a nation. I've been very careful to avoid spoilers but it's been pretty hard considering the many details that stood out to me. Whether you're a comic book/superhero fan or not, I would recommend this film to just about anyone who loves a powerful story with a subtle laugh every so often."
"tgibson8689","10","7","18","21 February 2018"," Fantastic movie that keeps me thinking!
","The family and I just got back a few hours ago from seeing Black Panther. I've always had a fascination with this mysterious character but only have a handful of comics of him. To me, this is a character I don't know as much about. I knew about Wakanda and the tribal elements of his culture but wow, I am a super fan now. The movie was incredible, and one of my favorite comic movies I've seen. With all of the elements I knew of that encapsulate the character, fighting style, ability, family and honor, this movie goes way more in depth with T'Challa. His way of thinking, his calm and intelligent demeanor and his way of recognizing that times are changing and that if changes have to be made, they can be for the betterment of all people. The themes in the movie definitely moved me, that and the incredible action scenes throughout. I loved the villain(s), the plot, the costumes, the cinematography and how it seems to connect with the Marvel Universe. Awesome time at the movies for sure. This movie is one to remember, far more complex and enjoyable than other comic book films. Always love Marvel but this ones is one of my favorites for sure. Even though this is another piece of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it's a great film either way in its own right."
"cruise01","10","23","79","16 February 2018"," Its too overhyped as a MCU movie. But still a great exciting adventure for the Black Panther character.
","Black Panther was awesome and the triumphant king of Wakanda. First thing first, I enjoy and loved the film as it stands out on its own. Plus the world building of MCU, now were introduced to the world of Wakanda, were technology is advanced by a few decades than everywhere else around the world. But it is also kept a secret except for the people from Wakanda. It was beautiful visually; it had some good action sequences, and an inspirational plot. I will throw this out there, I feel like the movie is overhyped. It was a great movie. But when you put this up with other Marvel films. There are other great ones and better superhero movies than this. <br/><br/>The pros about this film. Lets start with the plot. It does not feel like a Marvel movie at all. It is a good thing. It starts after the events of Captain America Civil War. T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) heads back to Wakanda. He is declared King. When he sees that Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) shows up on the radar selling vibranium that only belongs to Wakanda. And the rest of the world is not ready for this technology. T'Challa chases Klaue down and discover a mercenary Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) may be his biggest challenge yet. When Killmonger wants to take over Wakanda. Plot is inspirational, about a king that does not think he is ready. But is faced with an ultimate challenge politically when he wants to do what is right for his kingdom and the rest of the world. <br/><br/>The action sequences were good. May not be an action packed wild ride compared to other marvel movies. I ll be honest about the opening action scene was terribly lighted and dark and filled with close up camera shots and quick editing. When Black Panther attacks a convoy to rescue one of the hostages. But it gets better throughout. It has a few good action scenes. From the casino when T'Challa and Okoye (Danai Gurira) fight through some bad guys. To a car chase scene with Black Panther. And than a climatic battle Killmonger's followers and a fight between him and Panther on a futuristic railway. Director Ryan Coogler could have made some action scenes fun. When offered a 200 million budget. He really tried to be careful to not over do it. But he could have tried for a blockbuster approach. The visual effects were great. The music score stands out on its own as a MCU film with an electronic chant music. <br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman was great as Panther/T'Challa. Michael B. Jordan was also good. And stands out as a villain. When his motivation is slowly revealed after a tragic past that made him what he is today. Lupita Nyong as Nakia was great as T'Challa's love interest and wants to do something about the real world's conflict outside Wakanda. Danai Gurira has a lot more screen time and is good too. Same with Martin Freeman, who has more to do than his brief appearance in Captain America. And Letitia Wright as Shuri was great as T'Challa's sister and is the brains in offering new technology and gadgets. <br/><br/>Overall, Black Panther is a great film. I loved it. It is visually entertaining. The action was not top notch but it was good. The plot was great, it was a little too much in the political side than being a personal character story, and the huge cast ensemble was good. If the movie were standing alone as a superhero it would have been the best movie. But being part of the MCU, there are other great movies better than this. I feel like this film was lacking in the fun energy than the last several MCU films had. I still recommend seeing this film in theatres for its exciting action, an indifferent plot, and also there is two post credit scenes, I think the final end scene was a nice nod to a character. <br/><br/>I rate the film 5 out of 5 stars."

"frederikbarndorff","8","12","36","16 February 2018"," A epic, moving and exciting ride all the way!
","Black Panther is directed by Ryan Coogler and stars a phenomonel cast that includes Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyongo, Forest Whitaker, Andy Serkis and the list goes on. 
Set after the events of Captain America: Civil War, Prince T'Challa is about to be crowned king of Wakanda, but when a long buried secret is uncovered it threatens the country of Wakanda and the rest of the World! 
I really liked this film! And for a number of reasons. First of all this is a very well directed film made by the very talented director Ryan Coogler. The entire film feels original new and exciting thanks to his vision!
Whats also great about this is Wakanda it self. This beautiful land is so well realised on the screen. It serves as one of the most interesting locations in the MCU. 
What set Black Panther aside from the other Marvel films is it's great story that suprisingly tackles a lot of deep themes. 
All the actors are great in it, espescially Michal B. Jordan as the villain Killmongor. Killmongor is by far one of the best and most compelling MCU villains so far. His backstory and viewpoints are explored and you really get where he is comming from. However there was not quite enough of him. But whenever he is onscreen you are on the edge of your seat!
All these factors makes the film much more than just your average Marvel movie. It makes it into a film with a strong message and compelling characters. 
Black Panther is absolutely one of the best Marvel movies and highly recomended!
Final Rating 9/10"
"loganmvickers","8","27","96","17 February 2018"," Lived up to the hype
","I've been looking forward to seeing this forever and it didn't disappoint. I'm not a huge Marvel fan but I'll check out the films that catch my interest and the trailer for this one hooked me early. (Also side note the soundtrack is killer. I've been listening to it ever since it dropped.) I do love how Marvel finds a distinct subgenre within the superhero genre for all of their movies. This almost had a Shakespearean flavor to it with the palace intrigue and watching heroes plot and battle for the throne. Stellar performances across the board. I was surprised by how effective Michael B Jordan was as the villian as he's always such a charmer. <br/><br/>I'm very disappointed by all the negative reviews that seem to be part of the pre announced campaign by racist trolls to smear the movie like they did with The Last Jedi. If a movie isn't your thing that's one thing but to attack a film because it's lead by black actors or has a female protagonist... you're time of blatant bigotry is up folks. Join the rest of us and live in a world where respect for everyone is the standard or learn to live in the shadows and have your voice ignored like the rest of us have since the dawn of time."
"tomazeiteiro","Null","13","40","17 February 2018"," Absolutely blown away by this movie!!
","First of all let me tell you this: DO NOT believe the people who say this movie is bad ok?
 You can clearly see in these reviews that the most recent are the ones that qualify the movie as being great (8-10 stars) and almost every older review says the movie is crap. 
Why you ask? Because the older ones are from people who hadn´t even seen the movie and were just trying to harm its reputation (you can see this because this movie´s score on IMDb started out as 6,7 stars a week ago and is currently at 7,7)<br/><br/>Moving on... This movie is a visual masterpiece and, in my opinion, is one of the 3/5 best Marvel movies because:<br/><br/>A - Like I said, the movie is technically perfect and everyone agrees on that... The wakandian costumes are beautifully crafted, the set pieces are amazing, the special effects are on point at all times and the sounstrack... its just perefct in every single moment (kudos to Kendrick Lamar btw)
Examples: The last fight sequence with the rhinos, all fight sequences with the dora milaje, the korea car chase, etc...<br/><br/>B - A lot of people said the acting is bad... FALSE... the acting is as good as it gets in a Marvel movie... Not oscar-worthy of course... but I think Angela Basset and Letitia Wright (Black Panther´s mom and sister, respectively) delivered top notch performances<br/><br/>C - People also said the story is not original and it´s predictable... Look, of course it´s not amazingly original... But hardly any movie´s plot in present time is... However, the story is captivating and well told and it really doesn´t matter a lot in a Marvel movie if the story is really original as long as it´s well executed and allows the viewer to understand the film´s context (which it does in this case)<br/><br/>D - The villain isn´t good? Give me a break! This is basically Marvel´s best villain yet (alongside witth Loki)... Good backstory, charismatic and not just another bad guy with lots of guns but someone who actually holds political significance in his plan, like a real villain should<br/><br/>E - People saying the movie was overhyped and because of that critics aren´t giving their honest opinions... Man this allegations are so stupid and cliché... Critics give their honest opinions, wether you agree with them or not... You know another overhyped movie that critics bashed nonetheless? Suicide Squad! And man was I looking forward to that mess...
Now don´t begin with the whole ""critics always support Marvel and hate on DC"" talk ok? Critics rightfully loved Wonder Woman because it was good, not because they were paid to...<br/><br/>And they did the exact same with this glorious Marvel achievement! Please see this one. Ignore the pointless haters, because this one is quite something..."

","The movie was great. The graphics were sick! Jordan and Boseman did a good job. It seems like the movie will have a sequel. I missed the scene after the credits."
"CinematicInceptions","8","6","15","21 February 2018"," The Legend lives up to the Hype.
","It's been ranked on several lists as one of the most-if not the most-anticipated movie of the year, and thankfully it did not disappoint. There are some flaws in it, but for the most part it was a good movie that seemed to please everyone in the theater. Whether it's the best movie in the MCU thus far is up for debate, but it is undeniably a contender.
 I'll start by talking about the weaker points of the movie, because there were a lot more strong points. The main problem that people seemed to have in the initial reviews that I read was Michael B. Jordan's antagonist character. I didn't think he was half-bad, but I could see why people might not like him as a villain. Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) was also pretty weak as a villain, even though the threat he poses is pretty good. The introduction of the characters and their relationships was another weak point. There were a decent amount of minor characters that are featured throughout and it would have been nice to give a little more attention to them early on and clarify their roles a little better. The only other small problem I had was that the Wakandan's manner of speech was too formal. Yes, they're a tribal country that is supposed to speak English as a second language, but it still seems like they should have been less uptight.
 Even with those problems, it was about as good as I'd hoped it would be. The visuals and set design were obviously really good, but the movie doesn't get carried away with showing off cool fictional tech or other CGI eye-candy at any point. Superhero movies are not generally considered art, and this is no exception, but there are several shots that seem deliberate and motivated in a way that informs the story. T'Challa wasn't the most interesting character, but he's definitely an active and human protagonist and there are several really good moments where he has to make tough decisions and face hard truths. Tied in with this is the political argument, which was very reminiscent of the one in ""Captain America: Civil War"". I, and the three people I saw it with, thought that the political conflict was handled really well and was possibly the best aspect of the movie, which is a pretty rare thing for a super-hero action movie. It's relevant to some timeless and even a couple of current social issues, namely immigration.
 However, this does not mean that fans of traditional superhero action will be disappointed. While there are not a ton of action scenes, there are three or four big set pieces that were pretty good, and one early on that features some of the best action I've seen since ""Fury Road"". 
 The characters are not the strongest here, which may be accounted for by the fact that almost all of them are new. Even the familiar faces of T'Challa, T'Chaka, and Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman) were given minimal attention in ""Civil War"". The characters are written well in that their motives are clear, plausible, and create good conflict in each scene, which is something that many movies like this do a poor job with.
 There was some decent humor in it. A couple of the jokes fell flat or were annoying, but there was definitely a quality over quantity strategy in terms of comedy here. I must say that the soundtrack was a bit of a letdown, featuring none of the music that I loved from the trailer. The score wasn't bad, but I had been hoping for some more good beats and jams, and I don't think I was alone in that. 
 You'll understand things a little better if you've seen ""Civil War"" already, but you can really follow the movie just fine without having seen any of the MCU movies preceding it. If you haven't seen it yet, it's definitely worth the ticket price. Regardless of your expectations walking into the theater, you are not likely to be disappointed walking out. Overall Rating: 7.9/10."

Jordan was the Black Panther instead of Chadwick Boseman..Chadwick definitely nailed it as Black Panther but in my opinion, Michael B.Jordan would have done better as Black Panther but Michael did nail it as a villain and as well as Chadwick nailed as Black Panther.<br/><br/>I myself am a huge MARVEL fan & this movie is a great great addition to the Marvel Film's Franchise..Definitely will be buying this on Blu-Ray/4K to rewatch this amazing masterpiece!!<br/><br/>The VFX in this movie was unbelievable..I really wished that I watched it in 3D because I think this movie is meant to be watched in 3D & I did the same mistake with Thor Ragnarok which is another masterpiece..GO WATCH BLACK PANTHER IN 3D IF U CAN!! <br/><br/> DONT MISS THIS IN THEATRE'S!! STILL SHOWING IN CINEMAS!! U'RE GOING TO LOVE IT!!! & I give Black Panther a 10/10..<br/><br/>TRUST ME GO WATCH THIS MOVIE.."

The calmness of the characters, the steely keenness of their strategy and cool collected demeanor are all new. If you can appreciate that, you can appreciate every aspect of this film as a work of Art and something that young and old everywhere will remember for generations like the early days of Superman.

","Visually, the movie is rich great eye candy. But form the perspective of a story, this is Thor, or any other good vs bad family feud. In the Marvel universe there is nothing new here. While I am happy to see an attempt at diversity, Calling this character the 'Black Panther' and staging the story the way they did, felt like pandering. As with many superheros, you have to consider the context of the time period in which they are created. Black Panther was created in 1966 at the height of the US Civil Rights movement. <br/><br/>There are several areas that do not make sense. For example, if Vibranium (really?) were that powerful, then why wouldn't Wakonda be a leading world power? Why would it hide its superiority? That makes no sense.<br/><br/>Bottom line is this is just more Marvel eye candy that has no depth."
"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","7","5","12","17 February 2018"," Good, not nearly as great as everyone thinks
","After 18 movies the MCU has delivered a spectacular surprise - Black Panhter. His debut in Civil war was one of the highlights of the movie, and everyone wanted to see him in action in his own movie. And here we are, faced with a very good action adventure that deals with extremely difficult questions and intends to have a great cultural impact. Now, that sounds a lot for an MCU movie, an unfortunately, it is.<br/><br/>The thing that makes Black Panther a good movie is the acting, the visuals, the story and political-cultural critique of the modern day world. The acting is in every way superb with one exception. Boseman was, in regard to everyone else, overthrown. His acting is really, really good, but the problem is that he had to compete with the likes of Whitaker, Basset, Nyong'o, Jordan and (the great and powerful) Serkis. Not only does he find himself a little in the shadow of such great names, but certain newcomers such as Gurira do such a brilliant job that the main character actually becomes a little less interesting. But, do not mistake that fact with the fact that he does not act out the main protagonist in style - he does, and he does it very very well. On the other hand, Jordan dominates every scene with such ease it is almost disturbing. He is intimidating, dangerous, and has a great shift from a gangster looking and sounding persona to a legitimate Marvel villain halfway through the movie. His only problem was Serkis who, in many ways stole the movie. It is more fun to watch how much fun he had playing his character that one actually forgets to observe the surrounding story. Crazy, entertaining, fun and really the only character that stays with you long after the movie ends. On the other hand, Freeman did such a routine job that it almost hurt to see. He does function as a supporting character but seems disinterested and distant in many ways. A shame.<br/><br/>The visuals were impressive. The colors and contrasts of the Wakandan city to the bleak standard city depictions, the traditional African wardrobe and breathtaking scenery really make Black Panther worth more than just one watch. The musical background fulfills the ambient of the movie and gives every scene another layer of depth. So, the movie does have an atmosphere worth noticing.<br/><br/>The main problem with Black Panther is the fact it tries to deal with extremely important modern day problems (immigration, gun control, racism etc.). Now, the problem is that MCU has a way of portraying difficult subjects in a lighthearted manner. Black Panther is not lighthearted (thank God), but still does not pass that necessary boundary to make it a difficult and important movie. Passing that boundary is risky and does not always pay off (e.g. BvS Dawn of justice), but after 18 movies and such a fan base, a little risk should not present a problem. Simply noticing in a sentence or two problems of immigration (""If we let them in, they bring their problems with them..."") or gang related shootings (""No tears for me?"" ""Nah, that's just how things go around here.""), accompanied by a minute or two of heartwarming scenes is not enough. It is noteworthy, but more should have been done. The director does a marvelous job at that, but I fear studio interference took it's tole here.<br/><br/>Another great problem this movie tries to discuss is the conflict of traditional and modern day views. It is, maybe, the heart and soul of Black Panther but it feels a bit undone. It is unknown if this can be pinned to the problems of the script or the direction. Knowing how Coogler makes his movies (e.g. Creed), I'll go with script. This problem feels one dimensional, and it should not be. This is a problem that plagues the Middle east today, and dealing with it in such a way does not do it justice. That combination should have been explored more, worked out more, and the overall impact the movie would have had, would have been far greater.<br/><br/>All in all, Black panther is an improvement over the last few MCU movies. It establishes a direction that was much needed after the catastrophe that way Ragnarok, and seems like a transitional movie towards the Infinity wars. Superbly acted, decently written, greatly directed, but flat and one dimensional at points when dealing with difficult subjects. Well done. Really well done."
"thedarkrd","10","24","87","17 February 2018"," Black Panther Has to be established in his own backyard, before the world sees him
","It is not often that I take the time to write a review, but I believe for this movie it is in order. First, Black Panther as a character in the MCU has to be established in his position socially, politically, and globally - done, done and done. Second, the acknowledgement of T'Challa as a world force to be reckoned with is established in the context of his rule as King. For those who don't know, Black Panther/T'Challa is the only superhero who also is a head of state - this point is established solidly in his prior showing in Captain America: Civil War. Lastly, there is the ever looming conflict of how does a country engage the rest of the world when that world has shown hostility towards its potential advancement?
Those questions are established and debated strongly in this movie. While regarding the potentiality of development one African society could experience if never encroached upon by the outside world. Once again, the form and structure of the challenges for T'Challa and what he faces in overcoming these issues and shortcomings is established. Black Panther has to set the context of his story within his own domain, faced with having to overcome the habits of the past with the needs of the future. Black Panther sets up his further development into the MCU and the stories to come. What I respect about this film is despite it being fictional, it gives dignity to the issues Africa has faced from the 15th century unto present day. It approaches the issues of African vs African Americans and people who are considered the Third World, and the true misnomer it must be in regard to a society left to grow untouched by the outside world.
It tackles the homecoming aspect of African peoples reaching out to its descendants and antecedents. Black Panther covers an extraordinary amount of ground, establishing traditions, rites of ascension, acknowledgement of duty above personal interest or belief, understanding of community interest over individual interest. Ryan Coogler does an excellent job in the co-writing on this movie to set the tone for a character whose challenges are not only individual but global, socio-political, and scientific. I give this movie a 10/10 because if you understand the history, and how it is referenced and addressed, the MCU and Marvel Studios does not fail to pay respects not only to a challenging character to portray, but to ensure it pays respect to the cultural heritage which it is connected to. Black Panther is a broader character whose powers are not simply attached to his individual perspective on right and wrong, or good over evil, but the management of those powers in the protection of an entire nation and its diverse peoples (use, diverse - 5 tribes who warred, but established peace and established Wakanda). All in all, the powerful, and human figures. The dry and focused humor which are natural in such situations. Furthermore, the well defined personal values of beauty and power (especially amongst the Dora Milaje), and men who say what they mean, and mean what they say having the restraint to know how to excercise such power.
Go see Black Panther - judge for yourself, and before you decide it's not your typical MCU movie - That's the point, he's not your typical Marvel character. Enjoy!"

","Black Panther, to which I took foster son yesterday. Like many parents, I've taken him to many superhero movies. He loves them; each time, though, we're sitting there seeing white people/men doing amazing things in America or Europe. How refreshing, then, to sit with my brown-skinned (foster) son and see a cast of people who represent him for a change, doing amazing things in Africa and doing so without white people rescuing them. How refreshing to see a vision of Africa without colonisation; how refreshing to see a hero character who learns something from the villain and where Africa has something to teach and give to the world. How refreshing for a South African audience to hear a South African language in a mainstream movie. How refreshing to hear the round of applause as the audience recognised their stories being told, the laughs of recognition. I don't think my foster son is aware enough of the context to appreciate the significance of this movie, but I was moved and thrilled. As a white Western male I've seen too much of an idealised vision of myself on the screen; I want my children to be able to see themselves in films like this, with inspiring women and the stories of black people being told in films that are both good and fun.

","Ever since I was a kid and watched Marvel animated shows on Saturday mornings, one of my favorite Marvel Superheroes on The Avengers:Earth's Mightiest Heroes was Black Panther.For a long time after the success of The Avengers in 2012,I waited to see what the live action movie theater version of Black Panther would look like on the big screen.And in 2016 when the movie Captain America:Civil War was released,Black Panther made his first onscreen appearance and he was played by one of my favorite actors; Chadwick Boseman. And just like the avengers animated show,Black Panther was one of my favorite characters in the movie. And I am glad I saw the movie Black Panther during the opening weekend,because the movie helped make the Marvel Cinematic Universe and also introduced really cool characters in the movie, like Okoye played by Danai Gurira,M'Baku played by Winston Duke, Nakia played by Lupita Nyong'o,Shuri played by Letitia Wright, and N'Jadaka/Eric"" Killmonger"" Stevens played by Michael B. Jordan."
"Lursa","10","7","19","18 February 2018"," Black Panther Lives Up To The Hype
","SPOILERS BELOW!<br/><br/>Very few movies give me the thrill of discovery. Fewer still give me a sense of wonder or touch my heart. Black Panther ticked all my boxes. I throughly enjoyed this movie. True, there was a lot of hype going in. Marvel worked the numbers and made sure every person on earth with an Internet connection had access to snippets of the movie and trailers were released to keep the momentum going. I feared that this over exposure would work to the film's detriment. When the release date was announced, I thought, ""cute. release it during Black History Month. heavy handed much?"" I went in prepared to be disappointed. <br/><br/>I was NOT disappointed. <br/><br/>The level of excitement within the Black community where I live was high. Sure, we had Blade but that was over ten years ago. There was Spawn but, no reflection on Michael Jai White, who wants to identify with demon reject from Hell? I mean, really?? Other superheros of color? Don't think so. Sure, sidekick roles aplenty but nothing uniquely ours. I got to the theater in Vicksburg, Mississippi and was surprised at the lines waiting to get tickets. I bought my ticket on-line in anticipation of this very thing but the number of people waiting was more than I thought would be in attendance. Oh, and some people came dressed in their best Afrocentric garb. How cool was that?<br/><br/>Black Panther is more than a superhero origin flick. It is a genre bashing tour-de-force. It is indeed an origin story but it also includes some spy elements. There's some royal family hijinks and socio-political commentary. None of it is too heavy handed to get in the way of a rollicking good time.a Chadwick Boseman is on point as the titular character. We find him just as he is taking on the mantle of King of Wakanda and Protector The Black Panther. He survives a challenge by one of the leaders of a border tribe. But doesn't have time to settle into his role before he is challenged, again, by the long lost son of his uncle. A cousin he never knew he had. So the sins of the father are now visited upon the son. Michael B. Jordan wears the role of villain well. His Killmonger is filled with a justifiable rage. He challenges and 'kills' T'Challa' to secure the throne of Wakanda and the title of Black Panther. That's when his vision for Wakanda takes a turn for the worse. The supporting male actors led by Forest Whittaker are fully formed individuals with their own stories that weave into the tapestry that is Wakanda.<br/><br/>My favorite characters were the Dora Milaje. These fierce warriors are the body guards of the king. These characters were not based on myth. They actually have historic counterparts. The Mino were the all female regiment in what is not Benin. Westerners called them the Dahomey Amazons. And that's the other thing that the movie does. It gives us...all of us of African descent...something to be proud of besides animated lions and CGI gorillas. It allows us to be proud of the diversity of the Mother Continent without pandering or caricatures. This is not Congo, or Tarzan. The Africans are not bumbling sidekicks. They are front and center and they kick ass! The Dora Milaje have a vital part to play in the movie. They are not arm candy and need no one to rescue them. They are led by General Okoye portrayed by The Walking Dead's Dania Gurira. The Dora Milaje were introduced in Captain America: Civil War. Actress Florence Kasumba's one line (Move or you will be moved.) spoken with quiet authority piqued my interest. T'Challa's sister, Shuri, is a tech genius. She creates all his suits, weapons, gadgets and other items using the mineral vibranium that is only found in Wakanda. Angela Bassett is the queen mother.<br/><br/>The action sequences are astounding. Ryan Coogler knows how to shoot action to keep you on the edge of your seat. The casino fight was awesome. Two women fought numerous assailants. It's the first time I've seen a wig used as a weapon. Although, to be fair, Okoye was tired of it before the butt kicking started.<br/><br/>Black Panther has it all. There's humor, heartache, pathos, action, action, cool tech, warmth...something for everyone. Do yourself a favor and go see it on the big screen. You will not regret it. I'm going back to get another dose of all that Wakandan goodness. Join me."
"MichaelNontonMulu","7","11","34","15 February 2018"," Not the Best Superhero Origin Movie Marvel Had Produced
","I was actually hoping to see a story of how T'Challa from his childhood could became the Black Panther. But it was not the case. And this was not a conventional Marvel movies either as usually origin story was made first before the superhero appeared in other movies. Regardless though, the story was made a bit short and went straight to the time when T'Challa would be made king. Plus the how he came to know Everett Ross was not shown which made me felt the movie was not too complete as an origin story. <br/><br/>Other than those minor shortcomings that I personally felt, the movie definitely had some good moments. The action sequence in Korea plus the climax scene was awesome. The special effects (apart from few brief ""a bit obvious"" computerized scenes of Wakanda in the background during the time T'Challa was going to be crowned king) were very good. And there were also a bit of funny moments which involved Shuri plus surprisingly from M'Baku (Winston Duke).<br/><br/>I would really advise you to be fully concentrated from the start to understand better on the earlier parts. To my personal opinion, the movie developed to be more interesting when the villains began to appear and the fights started.<br/><br/>I get the appeal of this movie to critics due to its rather complex character development of T'Challa plus the appearance/representation of the African people in a world where third world country were still looked down. I myself as a simple minded movie audience preferred a more intense superhero movie, which I thought I did not really get in here. Therefore, even if the movie was hailed as one of the best in Marvel Cinematic Universe, I personally did not feel that. It may be good, but certainly not the best. Again this does not mean the movie was bad at all, even my wife was able to truly enjoy it. But as I felt it was not the best superhero origin movie & the fact that the action sequence were not too much, I still prefer other such MCU movies like the first Iron Man, Ant-Man or Captain America. Oh another thing, there was not a lot of surprises here, even 1 or 2 supposed surprising moments could have been guessed by my wife and I. <br/><br/>As usual, there would be end credit scene which was having 2 of them in this movie. So wait till the very end to make sure you see them. In conclusion, my personal view is that this movie was probably a little bit over-hyped."
"tavm","10","12","38","26 February 2018"," My second time watching Black Panther was even better than the first!
","This review replaces my original one from a few days ago when I said I wasn't as impressed with this one as the other Marvel movies. I also said I didn't think Chadwick Boseman was as impressive playing T'Challa as he was previously when playing Jackie Robinson or James Brown. Since I didn't sleep this time when watching this a second time, I can now say that Boseman was indeed as good, maybe even better, here as when playing those real-life public figures. And since I also now understand why the events happened when they did, I think this is as good, maybe even better, as those other Marvel movies made by that studio for the last several years. So that's a high recommendation of Black Panther."

Seriously beautiful. There are some iffy moments in the action scenes especially at the end were every tiny detail is CGI. The movements are very gracious and quick, which make for wonky image sometimes. <br/><br/>Story 10/10: This story is AIRTIGHT. For me it was kind of a perfect. Everything wove in perfectly. Every storybit had a pay off. The scenes served the story and not the other way around, which results in a rewarding film and is very rare. I think I only saw that in maybe civil war, winter soldier and the dark knight. <br/><br/>All in All, I cant stop loving this film. It is perfect for me. Yes I complained about the wonky CGI sometimes, but thats because you can't have zero negatives in a review right? I would give it a 10/10,, because i will watch it much more in the theatres."

","I was so excited to see this film that my expectations may have caused me to go into it with too much anticipation. <br/><br/>Simply put, it's visually spectacular, but I had trouble connecting with the main characters. The dynamics were well intended, but it felt a little forced. The fight scenes great, the music/soundtrack AMAZING!! <br/><br/>It took me about a good hour to get into the plot. Once the stakes are risen (near the end of the film/last act) then I was all in. But it took a vested interest. The music, action sequences, and stunning visuals forgive the parts where the plot falls short. But I can't help but think it may have been intentional direction to sort of restructure the typical Hollywood formula. I'm all for doing things different, but in this case, the plot fell a little flat, until the end (where it revs up 110%). <br/><br/>Overall it's a solid film and worth the watch. Just don't give up on it, because it really does get good, and there is a big payoff in the end."

The movie is certainly beautiful to look at - the graphics are stunning - except for the last fight scene that doesn't even look as good as many current video games.The actors are...fine. Their performance run the gamut from okay to good. That's it. Everyone seems to be angry or sad all the time. The humor in the movie comes from the leader of the outcast tribe and, of course, the great Andy Serkis, who seemed to be the only one enjoying his role.<br/><br/>Frankly, the critics astound me. This movie was derivative and far too self-conscious. Unbelievable as it may seem, of the few negative reviews from professional critics I have read, the best is from Armond White. Do yourself a favor and read it.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the measure of a good movie, for me at least, is how likely I would be to watch it again.

Little things like an African saying flawless Chinese, the spear scenes, the Amazon Alexa type of futurstic hologram, the smattering of history lessons on African masks, the ""Baby don't hurt me.."", turning the table of Africa on America, ""knives are so primitive"" line, ""colonizer"" swanky diss, the unbelievable intro without making any splash, brouhaha or stupid Mission Impossiblesque mindless explosion, but rather a nonchalant, subdued and subtle African theme of sounds instead of score and splicing shots in supernatural fashion....jusqua right dosage really hit the spot for me.<br/><br/>I never read a single page of comic book for this character but I thoroughly enjoyed it. <br/><br/>The acting is solid. The jokes are funny. The originality lies in showing the same things that were done to death by Hollywood in a new light with all the colors, aura and halation of African culture, pride and majestic beauty.<br/><br/>This movie is not about the plot. It's about artistic showcase. <br/><br/>Can't believe so many spate of negative reviewers putting salty comments. Makes you wonder about credibility and leitmotif.<br/><br/>I went to Downtown Disney with primarily white audience who took their kids and they gave a scattered applause at the end.<br/><br/>Then again white people are hard to please anyways. Especially the college read academic ones."
"pcalixte","10","4","9","25 February 2018"," Common, let's be really serious
","I am not a marvel fan at all. I'm so fed up of being fed the same non-sense that America will save the day, why does America always have to save the bloody day? For that reason, I prefer to watch European, Latin, Canadian, any other movies because it reminds me that , America doesn't always have to save the day all the time. I have very little patience and very little time. Forgive my tone, but when I read so many negative reviews, on a bloody marvel movie, common, what were you expecting, a surprise, a revelation??!! Let's be real. Of course, it was predictable, it's a Marvel movie!! The superhero will beat the villain, we know this before we step into the theatre. I almost didn't go, specially for that reason. I don't have time for this, I have a busy life to live and could be watching a British show on Netflix that will surprise me. <br/><br/>So I went in extremely sceptical about this black panther business. No I did not read the comic or watch all 17 previous Marvel movies. I didn't even know about this superhero. I just know spider man, Superman and I think captain America is one of them and the only reason I know about that one is that my teenage daughter finds him really hot and amazing and says it's the best marvel movie of all time and she has seen every single one of them. Sorry, I'm getting off plot here. So I was told this movie would be fantastic so I evidently went in expecting a bitter bitter disappointment, 1 star, at the most. I was pretty much just escorting my daughter. So wasn't I pleasantly surprised that the story, although, highly predictable, was actually fantastic. No America will not save the day. Some other people on earth exist and can save the day, don't care from where. But other Homo sapiens. Yes, they're flawed, and human like the rest of us, so they'll do the human sabotaging, human killing thing. But the acting was superb. Yes they were ""serious"" in their acting. They have a heavy load on their shoulder and didn't have the easiest life, and let's not forget, they are going through a grieving process. But this was actually superb acting, considering we're watching a marvel movie. So yes, I knew the superhero would save the day and kill the villain. But the depth of the characters was very much present for anyone that has eyes and an open mind. The costumes, makeup, hairstyles were nothing less than outstanding. I will return to see it with more of my family members and friends this time. Believe the hype."
"SmashandNasty","8","4","9","23 February 2018"," Marvel has finally cracked how to create a good origin story
","After the death of his father, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), returns home to the isolated and technologically-advanced African land of Wakanda, to take his place on the throne. The appearance of a powerful enemy threatens T'Challa's place as king, Wakanda, and the whole world.<br/><br/>Our take: See it in theaters.
Post credit scene? There's technically a mid-credits scene. And a post credit scene. It's Marvel movie, just stay.<br/><br/>
There is no doubt that you should see Black Panther and you should see it in theaters. It is a culturally groundbreaking film that deserves, and needs, support. It's a fresh look at the beauty of a movie with a nearly all-black cast. However, it doesn't escape some of the major Marvel pitfalls of the last ten years.<br/><br/>On the positive side, Marvel has finally cracked the code on origin stories - instead of getting bogged down with a full-fledged introductory movie, they introduced T'Challa in an earlier film. It worked for Sony's Spider-Man: Homecoming, and it works here.<br/><br/>The visuals are extraordinary, and much like Avatar, they are best viewed in 3-D or IMAX. One cannot watch the film without appreciating the costume designers, make-up artists, and production design teams. It's a masterpiece in all of these regards.<br/><br/>Yet, the film has issues that can't be easily ignored. Black Panther's plot is a throwaway when taken in the grand scheme of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Many viewers going into the film know that T'Challa will persevere as the Balck Panther and king of Wakanda leading into Infinity War. As such, any tension that could have existed is non-existent. Even for those that weren't armed with this particular knowledge, it was incredibly contrived and predictable. It's a low-stakes film and that's felt throughout.<br/><br/>In some ways, Killmongerer (Michael B. Jordan) is a step up from previous Marvel villains. Fueled by the anger stemming from years of oppression, he is the most relatable human antagonist that Marvel has ever seen on screen. Yet, none of that changes the fact that he is a disposable-one-film, one-dimensional villain.<br/><br/>And failing where most Marvel films excel, the film's score leaves more to be desired. It makes The Amazing Spider-Man's score seem decent, and that's saying something.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Another note to make about the film is how carefully utilized the few non-POC characters are. The presence of Martin Freeman (as Everett K. Ross) and Andy Serkis (as Ulysses Klaue) in this cast can't be overlooked, but the filmmakers knew what to do with them. They are background characters, but they didn't seem to be there superfluously. They didn't draw attention to their presence in exceptionally negative or positive ways. They were the token white men in a diverse cast, but it was tastefully done.<br/><br/>Featuring: an original soundtrack curated by Kendrick Lamar."

","Her it is, the last MCU movie before the long awaited Infinity War, Black panther is a movie that trys to be more than a surehero film, it has a racial message underline with a shakespearean and lion king backstory.
Probably they shouldn't have killed Ullysses Klaue so easily( great perfomance by Andy Serkis) but Killmonger is a cool bad guy too.
Two things leading to Infinity war, first we have alot of wakandian tech and vibranium to the fight against Thanos and we have Bucky Barnes back who is bound to have a huge part of the film"
"rockman182","7","4","9","19 February 2018"," Black Panther (2018)
","I was actually quite surprised to see the immense hype surrounding this film. Part of me was like, yes its a Marvel Cinematic Universe film so it'll be big. The other part was like wow this is blowing away the box office and is quite the phenomenon. The final stop before Avengers: Infinity Wars so of course I was ready for it. The introduction of Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War was one of the highlights of a super hero studded action blast. Overall, I quite liked what I saw here. Its not mind blowing and nowhere near the best the MCU has had to offer, but its a welcome addition to the Universe and is a good vehicle stand alone for a superhero who deserves it.<br/><br/>The film takes place slightly after the death of T'Chaka, and T'Challa (his son) becoming the new King of Wakanda and becoming the new Black Panther. Wakanda is a nation that seems third world to outsiders but the nation is actually thriving in science and technology because of its abundance of vibranium. However, outside forces are made aware of this and T'Challa's throne and kingship is challenged. The film has an absolutely wonderful cast at its helm. Boseman, Jordan, Nyong'o, Kaluuya, to name a few. <br/><br/>Visually, I think this film is on par with the best Marvel has to offer. The futuristic and scenic display of Wakanda just pop on to the screen. Boseman does well as a soft spoken yet unmistakable leader of his kingdom. I really like the Michael B. Jordan and Ryan Coogler collaboration and it works once again here. Killmonger is a good villain and its easy to rate him highly among the other MCU villains we have seen. Letitia Wright is also a real highlight of the film and likely has a bright future ahead of her.<br/><br/>Something else that really sticks out for me is the costume design in the film. Black Panther probably has the sleekest and best looking suit in the Marvel film universe. Add to that the suits capabilities. That whole absorb kinetic energy only to redeliver it moments later onto foes is so cool. A lot of the lore of what is capable in Wakanda with vibranium is really eye catching and does well to add to the mystique of the nation.<br/><br/>Some of the film feels formulaic though. Also, there aren't many gripping shocking moments, as the films plot unfolds into a predictable place. The action set pieces are quite nice, although the final battle is a tad bit disappointing. The mix of traditional African music and modern hip hop for the soundtrack/score was a bit off putting as well. I don't have that many complaints about the film but its also missing a bit of the awe factor that other films like Thor: Ragnarok and Civil War were able to bring.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm glad a lot of people have been praising Black Panther and have felt really inspired by an African hero. I have to say though I think its not in that upper echelon of Marvel films, but is still quite a respectable entry into the Universe. I'm ready to see Black Panther and his Wakandan allies in the Infinity Wars. Ryan Coogler is officially three for three in solid films. Pretty content with this film.<br/><br/>7/10"
"ashishdhamijahummer","6","4","9","17 February 2018"," Not the best Marvel movie - but still a watchable one!
","It is clearly not the best marvel movie but still a watchable one. I'll put down into small points listing the pros and cons of the film.<br/><br/>1. Accent issues - it was quite hard to understand what the characters were saying. 
2. Acting - some characters were just funny when they said a dialogue. It could have been better for sure. Well, not as in all the characters were funny. Some of them did their part quite well. 
3. Impact - What I felt was the film did not have the right impact on the audience as they do in every marvel movie. This movie just felt unfinished. 
4. Story line - Well that is one thing I loved about the movie so much. The story was really great. It was far better than a lot of other superhero movies. If you are a marvel fan, you should watch this one to get to know Wakhanda and where the Black Panther comes from. <br/><br/>Overall it was alright! Not a bad one. People definitely had a lot more expectations and it has just been overhyped that way. Don't listen to people who have been saying it is worst marvel movie or the best one. I would just say it was a fine movie. Not the worst but not the best too. <br/><br/>Get some popcorn and enjoy your time without expecting too much from it."
"nick-35580","9","8","23","19 February 2018"," Refreshing and Entertaining
","I have seen a lot of reviews on here about how the plot is lackluster and the acting is bad. I do not think that either of these things is true.<br/><br/>While I do see how some would see the plot, specifically Erik Killmonger's motives, as being heavy-handed; I think the statement about colonialism is powerful. Killmonger's suggestions, up until his final verdict about how to deal with his anti-colonialism, are all very valid even if they are shrouded in anger. He has a right to be angry, and as an audience you realize this.<br/><br/>T'Challa on the other hand is affected deeply by Killmonger's words and actions, and while he does not see his violent resolve as a helpful means of reparations, he still empathizes. By the end of the movie I feel as if T'Challa is different morally and changed very dramatically in a plethora of ways. <br/><br/>To go further, the entirety of Wakanda is changed forever. They open themselves to the world in an attempt to help others who are underprivileged or disadvantaged. All of the characters, lead or otherwise, change throughout the movie. It is refreshing to actively see change based on experience, especially in a solo MCU movie. And, it adds a new perspective to T'Challa specifically.<br/><br/>Basically, Black Panther was entertaining, the fight scenes were good, character development was good too. That being said, some CGI felt unfinished and some writing not edited well enough. This movie is not perfect, and it had its thematic and cinematic (visual) faults, but it was refreshing to see such great representation without it feeling forced or butchered. Worth the watch."

"wkhan-35155","1","3","6","26 May 2020"," Easily the worst superhero movie
","There is so much wrong with this film. Awful visuals, the dialogue is awfully cringe, the story is cliché and fails to build up and doesn't lead to anywhere. Not to mention, it handles the theme of racism horribly. Michael B Jordan says that really cheesy line at the end and it doesn't make sense with the movie. Why are they talking about slavery? Isn't it meant to be focusing on modern day racism? I am not from America, but I'm pretty sure there are no slaves there. It's everything that's wrong with the world, this film is. Calling Martin Freeman a broken white boy is one thing, but proceeding to call him a colonizer? I wish I could write a sign and give it to the director, the sign saying that white people weren't the only ones who kept black slaves. Honestly, if you think this film is genuinely enjoyable, you're wrong. Secondly, if you think it has a good message, you need to be locked up. Complete garbage, mcu fans will do anything to defend the overrated franchise that is the mcu. Not to mention the accents are awful, which makes the dialogue even more cheesy. There is literally a what are those joke in a 2018 movie. I think it's said in infinity war, but there was line about Starbucks which was so sickening to hear. Daniel Kaluuya and Martin Freeman are the only positive things about this movie. Daniel because he doesn't have an over the top accent, his character is more laid back and doesn't say anything related to humour. Martin because he somehow put up with this nonsense. There are a few things I'm passionate about and would give an arm up to let the whole world know, my hatred for this movie is one of those things. Top 5 worst movie of all time."

The effects were great and the cast were good just a shame that they had to give the villain such a bland story, make him out to be the next biggest hip-hop star (ruining the flow of an otherwise great score) and have him portrayed as a spoilt playground bully rather than a villain of credible threat."

"darkreignn","4","3","6","27 March 2018"," So mediocre
","""Black Panther"" is just another, average superhero movie if we're being honest. It's been getting rave reviews, but in my opinion it is massively over-hyped. And no, I didn't go into this movie wanting to hate it. In fact, I was excited walking into the theatre. But after the first dimly lit, poorly shot action scene, I knew I was in for a wild ride into mediocrity.<br/><br/>First of all, let's talk action because most people go see superhero movies for the high-octane action sequences. Literally every action sequence in this movie, except for maybe one, were awful. Why is that? Take the first action sequence that I mentioned above: it was so dimly lit and filled with shaky camera that the action was incomprehensible. And that was incredibly disappointing because it set the standard for what is to be expected, quality wise, when it came to the action, for the rest of the movie. Another big action scene that takes place in a type of underground South Korean casino had the same problem: shaky camera. Sure, the action is shown in a very clever one shot take that was cool to watch, but when the action can't be clearly seen because the camera is shaking and because the camera is too close up that the action is off-screen, the entire scene loses its entertainment factor. There is one action scene that I thought was exciting (it's towards the end and so you know exactly what scene I'm talking about, let's just say that it ends with someone being thrown off of a high place), but pretty much the only reason I thought it was exciting was because I really enjoyed one of the characters involved in the fight. And yes, it was better shot then the rest of the action scenes, but I've seen much better shot and more exciting action scenes in other Marvel films, like ""Winter Soldier,"" for example. And when an action film doesn't have good action, it's just disappointing.<br/><br/>Also, the titular Black Panther was one of the blandest main characters I've ever seen. I didn't connect with him at all. Killmonger, on the other hand, I could connect with. For the most part his rationale made sense, and at one point I even thought, ""How is this guy the villain? He wants to do a good thing."" BUT THEN, FOR SOME REASON, Killmonger's actions as a villain take a completely different turn and it seems like he completely changed his mind and wanted to do something entirely different. Maybe I just didn't get what he wanted to do or maybe I didn't understand how he wanted to complete his goals, but it was super stupid because his original goal absolutely did not need to be completed in the way he was going about it. I mean, when you get down to it, what Killmonger wanted to do was noble; it was something no leader of Wakanda was willing to do, or wanted to do, in the past, so I was totally on board with him and honestly, I wanted him to win. In fact, I kind of think Killmonger was the hero of the film - he just went the wrong way in trying to accomplish what he wanted, but if he would've accomplished his goal, there is no doubt that the positive consequences would have far outweighed the negative.<br/><br/>I really have not much else to say. This was just an ordinary superhero movie that did nothing new; it was bland. The villain was cool and gives viewers a lot of food for thought, but the action sucked, which pretty unforgivable, in my opinion, and every other character except Killmonger was forgettable. Other than that, yea, you can see this and maybe you'd like it but I don't recommend it. It's just a boring film - I was bored and I wanted it to end."
"ironhorse_iv","7","3","6","26 March 2018"," Black Panther roars into theaters. Was it good? It was alright.
","Follows the events of 2016's 'Captain America: Civil War'. T'Challa Udaku (Chadwick Boseman) returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda to take his place as king, only to find, that an old enemy, Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens AKA N'Jadaka (Michael B. Jordan) has reappears to challenge him for the throne. Without spoiling too much of the film, from all 'Cinematic Universe' movies from the Walt Disney Company & Marvel Studios so far, there is perhaps, none that is more celebrated from fanboys & movie critics, right now, than director, Ryan Coolger's superhero film, ""Black Panther"". The film received praise for nearly everything. It even become one of the highest-grossing films of all time. A global phenomenon. However, it does beg the question, is all that praise, truly justified? The answer is somewhat yes. 'Black Panther' was indeed an entertaining movie. However, it's not a complete perfect masterpiece of art. Some of the praise from critics and fans is a bit overblown to the point, that it sounds like pompous. They're overlooking some of the film's biggest flaws. Examples include the fishing plot-hole, pacing issues, the story being too similar to 1994's animation movie, 'the Lion King', the heavy use of fake-looking CGI during the clichÃ© looking chase sequences, the uneven & unrealistic portrayal of modern day economics in isolated sovereign state, and last, by not least, the lack of vulnerability & suspense when it comes to Black Panther's overpowered suit and abilities. All of these are worth criticize about. After all, all these issues came across, as very jarring on screen. It kinda took some audience members, out of the film. Although, it wasn't as distracting, as the obvious disconnected this movie had, over previous Marvel's films when it comes to the portrayal of Wakanda's intentional isolationism beliefs. Instead of having the nation be a little more open into intermingling with other countries; as seen in 'Captain America: Civil War'; where Wakanda had establish foreign aid with certain African nations like Lagos. The movie chose to backtrack, and make this African nation's people seem more traditional close-off; despite the fact, in the previous film, they were a powerful influencer in United Nation, when it comes to reviewing the Sokovia Accord. That was a big risky big retcon that sadly, didn't pay off. After all, Coogler and his writers kept the very public death scene for king, T'Chaka (John Kani) from the previous movie, even though, he supposed to be, a hermit. It doesn't add up. It lesser Killmonger's argument, big time. All this 'blind eye to foreign affairs' retcon muddled things up. It doesn't make much sense. Not only that; but it also made the world building seems a little more jarring. After all, how does the technologically advanced nation, stay so hidden for so long, during the Modern Digital Age? Do their citizens live within the country's border under a heavy watch by their government, unable to leave or bring anybody in? Seeing that Wakanda has assassins and spies, everywhere. I'm starting to doubt, that this nation is truly worth rooting for. After all, these are the same smart people that blindly follow their new leader into battle, without questioning anything about their way of leadership. The place sounds like a cult in the verge of turning into another Imperial Japan. After all, they worship a living embodiment of their panther god. Wakanda might be a highly control, centralized, cult of personality feudalism-like state. After all, there seem to be, some type of social caste system in Wakanda that borderline, doesn't seem right. If anything, side-villain, M'Baku (Winston Duke) seem more of the good guy than anybody in the film. He's the only one, truly using his brain, by questioning establishment and exploring his surroundings. Still, you would think, he would had expose the royal family's lies on the internet by now. After all, this tribe seem to know, a lot about some western culture. So, they has to be some sort access to the outside world to get that type of an information; even if it's hard to find a WIFI connect in the mountain. Regardless of that, another problem with the over-fawning by fans & critics, is how incorrect, some of them are with their praising. A good example is how some people treat this, as the first black superhero movie. They act like it's a milestone in cinema; which it is not. If you notice on IMDB, they has been black superheroes movies, way before this, like 1993's 'Meteor Man', 1997's 'Spawn' & 2008's 'Hancock' to name a few. It's nothing new. If anything 1998's 'Blade' deserve most of the credit. That's the true,' first Marvel black superhero movie ever'. Despite all that, there's are some truly some good examples to appreciate in 'Black Panther'; such as the Afro Punk design, the soundtrack, and the use of real foreign languages like Xhosa. Nevertheless, it's the unique characters that truly stand out. Even if, Chadwick Boseman's African accent sound cheesy. All the acting from the performers were great. Overall: While, 'Black Panther' might not be Wakanda Forever for me, due to plot-holes in the story. At least, it's not kitty litter. It's still a decent movie, worth checking out. Highly recommended."

","Marvel adheres to a tested recipe - ""If you've found a winning combination, stick to it."" They string high-budget action blockbusters one after another, maintaining the level with small variations. There are no masterpieces, but there are no failures either. Although I understand why they do it, personally, I don't like that approach, because all their movies follow same pattern and resemble each other. Without risk, there's no danger of failure, but there's no opportunity to make a really good movie either.<br/><br/>""Black Panther"" is visually stunning, fast-paced and entertaining. The combination of tribal features and futuristic costumes and technology is in perfect balance and the landscapes of Wakanda are beautiful, while the action scenes are directed to leave you breathless. The acting is good, but the characters and the story itself could be much better developed. Rather than to provide a good script, and then take advantage of big budgets and modern technology to make this story as impressive as possible, I think that Marvel films are based solely on the visual spectacle, leaving the story in the background.<br/><br/>I watched the movie in the theater and I'm not sorry, I enjoyed it and had a good time.

This movie is not worth 7 and up. 25% of voters gave it 10?? Thats not possible...<br/><br/>Im starting to wonder if hollywood is using bots to vote... Same thing with the star wars movies... So many people giving it 10..... Thats an A or a 5.<br/><br/>This voting system is corrupt!! People voting dont think 6 is good.... 6 is a good movie.. But since they dont know their math they think a good move is 7 and above...
6 is good. 8 is really good.. 10 is excellent.... There is just a handfull of movies that can have a 10.. If any...<br/><br/>7 and 9 is just a number that is used when the lower number of 6 and 8 should be the correct one...<br/><br/>So once again.. the voting system is corrupt"
"harleyburnett","5","3","6","9 March 2018"," Third Act Fell Apart
","Story wasn't super one of a kind, but the first and second act established a lot of interest and mythos worthy of excitement. That is until the third act. It seemed the visual effects money was spent too much on the first two acts because by the last 45 mins there was very bad green screen backgrounds that didn't match the character lighting at all in some shots followed by some bad CGI. (There was a bit of this earlier but it was acceptable) The only other problem is the ending. T'Challa is a hypocrite! Killmonger wanted to expand Wakandas resources to help the rest of the world. Living in poverty while the Wakanda live gloriously infuriates him and this and the death of his father as a child, drives his character. T'Challa and the Wakandans are against allowing their resources to help those in poverty for fear of possible wars started with their technology. But once Killmonger is defeated, T'Challa turns around and opens Wakandas doors to the world. There was no reason Killmonger should been murdered by Black Panther (T'Challa) and the only reason there was a conflict is because Killmonger took the throne and presumably killed T'Challa, angering his family/friends and they took upon an act of revenge. How did this ending even get approved?"
"DoctorRausch","5","3","6","6 March 2018"," Middle of the Pack Marvel
","BP is one of the most disappointing movies I've seen in some time. After stealing the show in Civil War I was hyped for T'Challa's standalone feature. Unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype. The plotting was sloppy, the action scenes uninspired, the CGI frequently dodgy, the humor forced and unfunny (like the M'baka's vegetarian line - dead silence) It felt epic and small at the same time. I wanted to know more about Wakanda, but it was nothing more than window dressing. I wanted some details of their daily lives, but all we see are people milling about in some kind of market place and every African trope you can think of. If a white guy directed this, they'd be calling for his head. It seems as though the only things Cooglar knows about Africa are what he's seen in the Lion King and Coming to America. Even though they're supposed to be super advanced, they have spears and armoured Rhinos! Really? And they determine rule by combat. Seems like intelligence would be more important than physical strength in such a society. There's a guy with the disc in his lip, women with rings on their neck, stuff straight out of National Geographic. If they are a secret society, why even bother with typical African tropes, it could have been anything. 
What I found the most off putting was just how lazy the script was. Many of the subplots were pointless, like the trip to Busan. During the car chase, the women are driving a car made of Vibranium. Bullets do nothing, but Klaw's hand weapon blows it to bits, even though he said vibranium makes his claw look like a pea shooter or something. T'challa drinks some kind of natural steroid during the combat to determine king, but both times he gets his ass kicked. What? The romantic subplot was tacked on and pointless. Vibranium can apparently enable one to do anything. It's supposed to be the strongest metal that can absorb impact but it can also cure wounds, be turned into thread, affect flora, turn tribespeople into experts in all technology, etc.
The plot was just so ridiculously stupid. The bad guy wants to send like five little spaceship things to give vibranium melee weapons to ""war dogs"" all over the world to enslave everyone. I'm not even going to touch on the insane racism of this since it was the villains plan, but how is that even a threat? It would only result in a few terrorist incidents and an eventual war for Wakanda. So dumb. 
Another problem was that we just had Spiderman that featured Ironman, Thor that featured Hulk, and this got...Martin Freeman? Sure they introduced a lot of characters but they were all African Stereotypes and one Mary Sue (Shuri). None of them were very relatable. 
The only thing the movie had going for it was the acting. They did the best with what they were given. Even T'challa was pretty dull. He was the boring boy scout people give Superman shit for. He had way more presence in Civil War, he was a slightly arrogant bad-ass in that. It gave him an edge. Here he's a vanilla boyscout that sometimes ""freezes"" and gets his ass kicked. 
For the record I consider Ironman, Avengers, Winter Soldier, and Ragnorok as best Marvel and Ant-Man, Age of Ultron, Thor 2, Ironman 3 and sadly Black Panther as worst. People shouldn't be celebrating that it merely exists, they should be mad they were given such a lazy, mediocre product. I am."

","It is the first film in Marvel Universe that displays a African American as the main hero, who is surrounded by a lot of strong independent female characters. The idea is gripping but the execution is poor. The development of the main character was presented in a general, predictable way. In the comic books the hero is arrogant, it could have been better if it stayed the same. Lots of mistakes in editing, weapons are not advancing. Although costumes are very nice. Mixed feelings altogether."
"nathanjohnsonc","7","3","6","27 February 2018"," Great Movie, but it's Not THAT Great
","I have been having a sort of ""burn out"" with superhero films lately, so I wasn't originally planning to see Black Panther at all. However, I kept hearing how great and awesome this ""masterpiece"" was, so I decided I would go see it (and at this point, it really is just something that's expected, which is fine). So, I went in with marvelous expectations (aside from some criticisms I had heard beforehand), and... how was it?
Well, let me just say that I enjoyed myself thoroughly. It was WAY better than I thought it was going to be, and it was really fun to watch. All of the performances are generally great (except for a few which I'll get in to), and the plot is good as well. There are some issues, however, that bring the movie down, which I'll go into spoiler free at first. Some of the special effects are just downright bad (there are bits where you can actually tell the person is standing in front of a green screen), and there is dialogue that is spoken that just seems... off. I don't know, it just seems misplaced and weird-sounding. Also, it is hard to ignore the fact that yes, the plot is good, it is certainly a Marvel plot, if you know what I mean.
My biggest issue with the movie, and the one that brings it down so much, is that there is a side plot that is completely unnecessary, and completely ruins the tone of the film. Basically, the only reason this side plot exists is to add a little more to the end, and to give the main characters a little more motivation. That's it.
In conclusion, check this out if you want a fun superhero movie, that's better than a lot of recent ones, but also has a few problems (7/10)."

"mierawr","3","3","6","26 February 2018"," Graphic and design-wise is good, but plot is boring as heck.
","Okay, okay. Don't flame me. I love Black Panther when he first appeared, I love him in Civil War. But in this movie, I don't like his character at all. I could understand him when he's brooding and quiet after his father's death, he's grieving and sad - now that he's crowned and all - he's not? Feels like a flaw in the character here.<br/><br/>The script is poor. At some point, I'm a little bit annoyed at the vine jokes they put in the movie, but that's not the point. It's more like... The villain is not so villainous after all. He just wants revenge, a typical background for a villain. How great.<br/><br/>What I think is nice is Klaue. He's unpredictable, he's a little off here and there. But he could be a better villain than Killmonger, to be honest.<br/><br/>The good point of the movie is, well, because Marvel is pretty good with designs and graphics. I like the cultural aspects they put in architecture, and the mixture of slight cyberpunk and traditions. It's beautiful.<br/><br/>I don't have comments for cast, because well, they're pretty much good actors. I'd praise Michael B Jordan if he could be given a better Killmonger, but aaaa too bad - they cut him off too."

"coldwinter-92707","4","3","6","24 February 2018"," Way too much hype
","There was a ton of CGI used in Black Panther. So much so that it was getting annoying. Standing structures look really good in Wakanda (Asgard and the Amazons Island looked great in the marvel universe as well). It's the mixing of live action and CGI that don't Jell, hopefully they get better using CGI and fix this in later movies (for example the fighting rhinos just looked ridiculous).
 Every motivation and jibe thrown in this movie was clearly pandering to the left. This made me sad, to me a superhero movie is supposed to be good fun for everybody. I don't need to site examples of the politics in play they're just so blatantly ""there"" you can't miss them. Unfortunately not even superhero movies are safe from politics anymore.... 
The plot of the movie was weak, there were no surprises to be found. Everybody knew T'challa was still alive and that he would be back (T'challa losing that fight to Warmonger and being tossed over that convenient waterfall was easy to forshadow). Why this society let Warmonger take over and remain in power after his first decree was to burn all of the black panther plants was amazing. At that point everybody should have just agreed to kill him, but they didn't because, movie. 
Wakanda was pretty, (the invisible jet was pretty cool), I also enjoyed the performances of Warmonger and Smiegel so I'll give this movie a 4."

"jarett-33760","4","3","6","20 February 2018"," Disappointing Story
","I had high expectations for this film after I saw Black Panther appear in Civil War. Unfortunately this movie fell way short of being a good Marvel movie. I'm not sure what the critics watched, but this movie does not deserve a near perfect score. I usually don't review movies but I saw on rotten tomatoes that the majority of reviews were 5 stars from people who hadn't seen the movie yet.<br/><br/>Story: I was happy to see the setting of Africa and the city of Wakanda. It was fresh and had the potential to be anything it wanted to be. However the pace of the movie and the character arks and motivations didn't sit well with me throughout the movie.<br/><br/>CGI got spotty really quick, especially during the last fight scene which was disappointing because at the very least the movie lead to the one climatic fight.<br/><br/>The woman general that is always besides black panther was my favorite character by far. It seemed like she is the only character that got any sort of development.<br/><br/>Music really broke immersion for me. the transitions from a beat oriented or suspenseful sound to African calls and more tribal music was such a stark difference you almost want to cringe. It seems they only played that music when showing the viewer that the setting had returned to Africa."
"JoshuaMooreBE","6","3","6","20 February 2018"," Tries to be different, but keeps pulling back to the same.
","I want to start this review saying that I think it's really silly that this movie has caused a political discussion. Not because the movie and marketing didn't ask for it, but after watching the film, the movie is really nothing more than another marvel film. The movie does things better and worse compared to other marvel films, but as it stands outside of the spectrum, it's predictable and isn't anything more than a superhero film. I'm very glad we have a superhero film that is this heavy in the representation of the black community during this age of popularity in superhero films, but that's really as far as any ""political stance"" should go into this film.<br/><br/>As a movie, it's fine. There wasn't any moment in the film where I felt impressed from what I was looking at, and there were times where I know Marvel can do better. Lets start with what I think it did superior to other marvel films.<br/><br/>1. The music. I think this is hands down the best original soundtrack we have gotten from a marvel film, and this is easily on par with the actual usage of their soundtrack outside of the guardian movies. Instead of being generic samey orchestra music that is used in every marvel film, we now have a soundtrack that sticks out from others in the franchise. <br/><br/>2. The villains. Marvel has been getting better with their villains since Guardians Vol 2. And this movie has two. Both of which were my favorite performances in the film, being Michael B Jordan and Andy Serkis respectfully. It's really refreshing also seeing a villain you can root for this time around.<br/><br/>3. The designs of the characters, world and weapons. How the CGI looked is a topic for later, but i loved the world of Wakanda and watching the characters walk around it. And every character had something in their design that felt right for the character they were playing.<br/><br/>And that's really about it. And those things listed above aren't anything real impressive, just good. Now for the negatives. <br/><br/>The CGI and all the effects were horrid. And I can't believe some people are trying to say it was passable. Every time the camera was zoomed out and black panther was on screen he looked straight out of a video game. It was superman in Justice League levels of bad. This goes for most of the environments, spaceships, animals etc. I know CGI is necessary for this movie and I'm not bashing CGI, but when you film outside couldn't you just use the outside? what's the point of the green screen and why does it look so bad? Anytime they were in a room that didn't have anything more than 1 level, it was clearly CGI city. <br/><br/>Also the jokes. Marvel movies are known for being pretty funny and generally I agree even when the jokes ruin perfectly good scenes, (cough cough Ragnarok, cough cough Guardians 2) the jokes in this movie gave me a smile at most. And I think a dreamworks executive might of mixed his script into this one because there is a ""what are those"" joke, a ""I make it rain"" joke, and a ""whip her hair back and forth"" joke. Way to slap a stamp on this movie that says ""this was made in the 2010's""<br/><br/>While the negatives of this film affect my overall score pretty greatly as they are significant parts in the film, the rest of the film is very okay. The story and plot is okay. The dialogue outside of the jokes is okay. The action is okay. If it wasn't for the original setting and feel of the theme in the music this movie would be right alongside Doctor Strange and Ant Man as just another stepping stone for the marvel franchise. I'm glad I watched it, I still enjoyed it, I'm just really not rushing at all to see it again."
"kamin-987-808346","8","15","51","18 February 2018"," One of the best marvel movies to date.
","Hail Wakanda! This has to be one of the best Marvel movies shown to date. First off, there is an actual coherent storyline. Basically, the movie is about inter-turmoil between Wakanda tribes on the subject of releasing their tech to the rest of the world. Some are against the idea as it will expose Wakanda to the world and some are all for it thinking it's for the greater good. The bad guy is pretty human by Marvel standards. In the end, he just wants to go home, gather his people and help save all the other oppressed people of the world. There is action but not as much as some people seem to like. There is no major alien/godly badguy to defeat. They are really just fighting themselves. The cast is colorful and you are not bombarded with stale jokes every frame (unlike Thor Ragnarok). I give this movie a solid 8 out of 10 stars. I do think the bad guy could have been a lot tougher to defeat and there were a few small items not clarified (So what do they do now that all the plants have been burned up?) but this was a pretty enjoyable flick"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","13","43","16 February 2018"," Sleek, fierce claws and bite, you can't take your eyes off it... and yes, gloriously black all over
","T'Challa(Boseman, charismatic, not mistaking considering issues for being indecisive) returns to his homeland of Wakanda to succeed his late father as king after the latter's sudden murder. Will he continue the way things have worked for centuries, or go down a different path? How does one best aid one's own people? And does that extend beyond your nation's borders? Can he stop Killmonger(B. Jordan, passionate, wrong only in how far he goes and not in what he seeks to solve), before he tears the country apart from within?<br/><br/>This shares a lot of traits with The Wonder Woman solo movie. It's about time that they are made. but being filmed now, they can use recent events, and the franchise they belong to, to great effect. They celebrate, not excuse, not mock, not downplay, the traits typically thought of as natural, or even culturally, historically, geographically, important to the minority that they're about. They're telling a story important to that group. Exploring themes specific to them. Presenting a fictional, powerful country, where they are in charge, they are the rule rather than the exception, and govern by their strengths. And now to get into what separates this from the Gal Gadot-led picture, and I'm not saying that movie could have, or should have, done this, as it is, intentionally, a different story. That is about a woman on her own, in a world dominated by men. This is fully immersed in African culture. It is relevant to black people in the US, and all over the world. But it's not about immigrants, or their descendants. Which is not to say that it's snobby. Free of the pressures of the majority of the population who are distinct from them, never made to be ashamed of who they are, The Five Tribes do have all the power that their kin continue to fight for as they have for hundreds of years. In fact, far more than that. And so, it asks, how do you use that? What makes a great leader?<br/><br/>All the visuals are dazzling. Costumes, sets, designs, cinematography, etc. The acting is great. Shuri(Wright, infectious smile, casual, a brilliant engineer) steals every scene she's in. Coogler, known for drama, of course handles that aspect with a deft hand. And unusually for a first-time Blockbuster director, also the action, scope and massive budget. A little of the coverage and editing is awkward, showing his inexperience. but that is barely noticeable. The James Bond meets The Godfather feel blends the classic with the ultra-modern perfectly. The ancestral plane seems made for going into father son relationships. The War rhinos(!) Are an inspired touch. This is full of black women. They aren't looked down on, or angry side-kicks. Several are serious bad-asses. They give the protagonist advice, from their different perspectives, and he considers all of it. My only real complaint is that this did not take the final step in making this completely accessible for those unfamiliar with the MCU. If you did not watch the film that introduces the Black Panther, you will not understand, as this does not retell, what happened after the explosion that hits the UN. And since going blind into that film is even more confusing(If you watch Age of Ultron before it, you can follow it no problems... but not everybody knows that), that means this can't be watched by everyone. So I urge you. If you didn't already, catch those two films first, then go see this . Obviously, not everyone has, or will, see all 17 leading up to this.<br/><br/>There is some violence and strong language in this. I recommend this to everyone. I give this a perfect rating not to even out the overall score, a practice I do not believe in, but because it deserves it. I reserve that for only the best. I give it rarely. And I am thrilled to award it to this. 10/10"
"politicidal","9","6","16","21 February 2018"," All Hail Black Panther, King of Wakanda (and the 2018 box office so far)
","Black Panther leaps off the screen in a dazzling adventure with a decidedly unique Afro-futuristic vibe. Director Ryan Coogler may have started out with independent dramas but his style feels at home within the MCU.<br/><br/>Set not long after CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR, the film follows T'Challa, the newly christened king of Wakanda as he combats evil forces from outside and from within his own nation.<br/><br/>From a visual standpoint, BLACK PANTHER has one of the most beautifully rendered superhero worlds since the cosmic setting in both Guardians of the Galaxy movies. The city and landscape of Wakanda are artistically stylized as one might expect from an advanced African metropolis. The costumes and props seem practical within the MCU universe. Amazon warriors, prosthetic cannons, battle rhinos, and combat by waterfall don't seem out of place in this continuity. <br/><br/>The nearly all-black supporting cast is mostly strong. Michael B. Jordan and Andy Serkis are both excellent as the villains; Jordan is especially great and perhaps the best and intimidating MCU villain since Ultron. Lupita Nyong'o is that rare capable love interest that you don't see often in comic book movies. In fact, all the female characters are strong, resilient, and play a role in the plot. Given the comparatively darker tone, both Leticia Wright and Martin Freeman lighten the mood as Black Panther's sister and CIA contact respectfully so.<br/><br/>What's interesting is its tone and subject matter. Unafraid to incorporate politics into its plot, BLACK PANTHER boasts the usual stuff like action and spectacle, but its timely message of inclusiveness and altruism versus hatred and revenge ring so true for the present day. It's bold for a blockbuster, especially a superhero movie to proudly embrace the creativeness with an African setting and all black cast. <br/><br/>Even rarer is the maturity to call attention to pressing social issues but condemn militant retribution as more radical elements often call for. Yes it addresses racism and other problems suffered by black people. There is already a backlash against the movie because of this. But it's conscious enough to not take the stance that means 'white people are evil' or 'black people should riot or take over'. For heaven's sake, the main antagonist Killmonger (Jordan) is an embittered black nationalist whose actions are condemned in favor of more peaceful measures. One would think the internet would be happy that an SJW is the villain but whatever. <br/><br/>Sporting high tech gadgets, a wide cast of memorable characters, a kickass soundtrack, and even social commentary to boot, BLACK PANTHER starts the year 2018 right."

This movie is the only Marvel movie deeply rooted in more fact than fiction. The Villain has an agenda very closely connected to the modern world and real historical events. His weaknesses and pain are very relatable and the conclusion actually happened in 1994 South Africa with Nelson Mandela, It is that realization that made me love it more, when fiction and imagination turn out to be as realistic as possible. 
The score is too incredible for words, the African drums come in at the perfect moment all the time and the resonance tugs at the strings of your consciousness and raises your heart rate to an intense but enjoyable level.<br/><br/>Visually it is stunning how they got the costumes right and pulled from all African countries.

Spiderman homecoming was good but for me it had a few issues like every character had to be funny except Spiderman and he suddenly lost his ability to use his suit despite being incredible in Civil War. <br/><br/>But I came out surprised and happy with Black Panther! <br/><br/>So overall I am giving it an 8

","My Wife and I saw this movie with our boyfriend (open relationship). He's black, and said it's the best film he's seen since House Party. My Wife just loves to see him happy, and if she's happy, I'm happy.<br/><br/>Personally, I was a bit taken aback by the ethnocentric themes of the movie. The nation of Wakanda seemed to have virtually no racial-diversity at all that I could see. Is that really such a wise thing to be encouraging these days? I'm not sure.<br/><br/>Still, its an important moment for Black America, and Lord knows they deserve it. Mazel tov!"

","As a fun Marvel Movie, this one is OK. We finally get to explore the hidden, yet very advanced African country of Wakanda, and as we wonder why they do nothing with the power and knowledge they have, the film explores that, too. It's too bad that basically Chadwick Boseman plays a CGI Jacob King and the plot is that of the Lion King. What would Disney say? Well, nothing, because this movie is made by Marvel in collaboration with Disney Studios. Yet we did have to introduce Black Panther before Infinity Wars, so that is why this movie was made.<br/><br/>It's not all bad, though. The acting is good, the special effects - barring the fight at the end - are nice, the story makes some sort of sense. The basic outline of the plot, though, is that, in the spirit of unity between men, Wakanda should rise from under its cover and help black people everywhere. Or that, in the spirit of helping the oppressed, it should rise from under its cover and conquer the world. Yeah, neither of those sentences make a lot of sense.<br/><br/>Bottom line: fun, better than average, but frankly I would have preferred a spin-off movie with Ulysses Klaue as the main character. Do that, Marvel!"

","Actually that is not entirely true, because you can go back. Then again that would not rhyme with Panther anyway. And not you as in you but Chadwick who ... well you'll know what I mean once you've seen the movie. But back to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I am really still surprised that people who loathe what Marvel has done, go and watch the movies and just see what they already made up their mind they will get served in the first place.<br/><br/>I'd say this has an original take to it. I do understand if you say they feel the same to you. If that is the case, don't bother watching them. Also I'm still surprised there are people out there who still haven't figured out there are stingers at the end of the movie. During and after the credits - stay tuned folks. Now another small incident that I witnessed that occured was when a couple came out of the movie an hour into it and upon me asking them if they were alright, they said they didn't like the movie. Fair enough, we all like different things. Someone else asked them why though ... and their answer was that it was racist and cliche. Two white people claiming to know what black people think? Yep that surely must be the wrong side of ""woke"".<br/><br/>Enjoy a movie that is more than just a movie. It was made and became a phenomenon. Now besides the ""Tolkien white guys"" (a joke that was made on set apparently, according to one of the two white guys in the movie, Martin Freeman), this gives us a movie made under the helm of Marvel but creatively they put a lot of trust into their director. And this was something that touched a nerve in the public - rightfully so. Because apart from having a predominantly black cast (and director), this also is a very entertaining and good movie.<br/><br/>The movie itself gives us a closer look behind the mythology of the Panther. And it is quite interesting. There are a few hiccups along the ride, but the movie works overall. And it adds to the ""universe"". Those movies are supposed to be light and fun ... but they still can carry a small political message. Both are not mutually exclusive"

"RforFilm","7","5","13","20 February 2018"," I don't know if this is ""grand and revolutionary"", but Black Panther is a very entertaining movie
","In this day and age, the studios are under a lot more pressure to represent different nationalities and backgrounds. Those that are asking for it are right; it's important for black children to have black role models as it is for LBGT individuals to have role models that are just like them. Many artists and directors want to adapt and give people something different, but they also understand that studios are still trying to make a profit. That's not to say an African-American lead can't draw an audience, but movie making is expensive, so they have to make sure that whatever they put on the screen can draw in all people of interest. <br/><br/>In the case of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, they've done well so far with bringing in black stars. We've got Samuel L. Jackson for Nick Fury, Anthony Mackie as Falcon from the Captain America films, and Don Cheadle as Rhodes from the Iron Man movies. One of the surprise popular characters to debut was Chadwick Boseman from Captain America: Civil War as the Black Panther. The character has not only led his own series in comics that's still running, but is the only African-based hero I'm aware of. Let's see how he does on his own in Black Panther. <br/><br/>In the hidden country of Wakanda, it has created groundbreaking technology, thanks to it's source of a rare substance called vibranium that landed via comet thousands of years ago. Though much of it could have benefitted mankind, the leaders and previous kings have made the decision to isolate themselves from the world.<br/><br/>After the events of Captain America: Civil War, T'Challa (Played by Chadwick Boseman) is crowned king and reigning heir to the mantle of the Black Panther. It's revealed that along with the suit that's made from it, he gets his internal powers from vibranium. <br/><br/>When he hears that a Wakanda artifact is being sold underground, he travels to Hong Kong along with his sister Shuri (played by Letitia Wright), his ex-lover and spy Nakia (played by Lupita Nyong'o), and proud warrior Okoye (played by Danai Gurira). Though they capture Ulysses Klaue (played by Andy Serkis), he's broken out, thanks to his boss Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens (Played by Michael B. Jordan). By the time T'Challa and his group return to Wakanda, Erik reveals his identity as a tribal son and challenges him for the throne. T'Challa loses, is thrown down a waterfall, and Erik gets ready to ship out much of the Wakanda technology to black markets. Will T'Challa manage to stop him?<br/><br/>Many people have been touting Black Panther as a grand and revolutionary super hero story that different. While I don't know if I can call this different and revolutionary, Black Panther is a very entertaining movie regardless. It's clear that director Ryan Coogler (Creed) not only wanted to show a different hero, but a different world together. The two best elements to the movie are the side characters and the setting.<br/><br/>When it comes to who the movie is following, it tries to give us a lot of characters...and it does work. I liked Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurria, Andy Serkis, and especially Letitia Wright. The winner here is Michael B. Jordan who plays one of the better Marvel villains. While he is physically powerful and intimidating, he also makes a compelling case for the mistakes that Wakanda has made by it's isolationist polices. While he isn't bad by any means, the least interesting character was the Black Panther himself. He does carry a royal energy of leadership; he doesn't seem to have that same struggle for mistakes of his countries history that I got from Michael B. Jordan. I think the script could have done better with that, and show him how he earns his mantle back. The movie does try to show out hero at his worst before he tries to fix everything, the story still succumbs to typical superhero tropes. <br/><br/>Now having said that, what they do with Wakanda is really cool. This design reminded me of The Guardians of the Galaxy movies, in which things are very colorful and lively. It seems the overall goal was to create an African utopia and everything from the architecture to the costumes are great. I wish there was a video game to Black Panther, just so that I can get a better glimpse into this country and it's culture.<br/><br/>I'll give this seven Black Panther helmets out of ten. In a large sea of superhero movies, and even within Marvel superhero stories, Black Panther manages to remain it's own unique thing. I had fun watching it and families will probably be pleased with it. Give it a watch and see it's powerful roar."
"jeannefrancoise","8","5","13","20 February 2018"," Africa meets high technology
","Dear readers, Black Panther is here to remove all your prejudices about Africa and racism that counters the Africans, eventhough the word ""black"" here is not representing African continent, but the power of hero, like a Panther, whose the color is black. So, the Black Panther movie is not just about a hero, but also politics among nations. The term hero is because the source of Black Panther energy is made only for heroes and the term of politic is main of whole story plot. It is about a new King replaces former King, but the former King had some mistakes on the past, so that the new King must remove and heal the wound of the nations, but in the same time, he must also take sacrifices to do the right thing for protecting Wakanda people. That's why the tagline ""Wakanda forever"" becomes viral and now everybody wants to do tourism in Africa because the landscape is so beautiful and the Director could mixed up the African continent with highly technology, as similar as other sci-fi movies. The plot also contents the girl power; because the highest military commander of Wakanda is a woman and all women had their essential parts for the development of the movie character. Some of wardrobe of women look like Xena the warrior princesses, that is compatible with wardrobe of the men that is more modern. The story is easygoing, not to hard, because the reverse memories are only in some scenes, so that the other scenes are just going forward. We hope that there will be Black Panther 2!! :)"
"mohan59","8","5","13","20 February 2018"," Discount the hype, discover a film
","For far too long, Marvel Studios' PR department has been waging a sustained assault on us patrons' psyche with over-the-top promotional material, ranging from comic conventions, merchandising, endless trailers/previews and cultural references. Whoever is heading that unit needs to take a vacation, along with the staff. Immediately. This is a serious request.<br/><br/>Because what we have been led to believe is Black Panther is the best superhero film ever made on the legendary African warrior.<br/><br/>This film is nothing of the kind. Instead, it is a compelling and competent drama of greed, loyalty, vengeance, and social standing. Other reviewers have pointed out that this film is quite overrated and not worthy of the hype. To be very honest, that was my feeling as soon as the credits rolled. It was a few minutes later that my appreciation of the film's tone and import started to change. This film is not about a fictional kingdom or a mysterious metal or other tangible things. It is more a study of who we are as a human race and where we stand today.<br/><br/>I will try not to spoil the film for others. There are numerous scenes where characters wrestle with their inner conscience, confront a dilemma or two, and balance critical decisions with consequences. These scenes are not hoisted out of reality, we experience moments like these ourselves. Circumstances can make past decisions look outdated and wrong, even. At the same time, embracing change a little too quickly has pitfalls as well. There is a line said by a male character, which goes thus: ""It is tough for a good man to be a leader"". And it is true. Not everyone is born a leader. People learn and evolve over time, dealing with situations that sometimes are beyond their control. And by presenting those situations, the filmmakers have chosen a path that can be a little underwhelming to viewers at first, but relatable to us in some ways. I would even go as far as to say the overall theme of this film is more about what we are willing to do to protect who or what defines us without losing sight of what unites us all. It does sound serious, but the film manages to tackle these topics. Not expertly, but in a reasonably convincing fashion.<br/><br/>The cast is near-perfect. While Chadwick Boseman could have done better by adding a little spark to his T'Challa, he has an extraordinary screen presence in the guise of the titular hero. A simultaneous ninja-statesman, his brand of aggression, without any outward weapons, is ferocious and decisive. Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o are excellent as General Okoye and War Dog Nakia respectively. Their fight sequences are superbly choreographed, along with those of the others. Michael B Jordan's acting chops are legit, he exudes menace and power as Killmonger. Daniel Kaluuya is a strong addition to an already-impressive line-up. But I was most impressed by Letitia Wright as Princess Shuri, the feisty younger sibling of the King. A firebrand techno-genius who can handle a skirmish quite capably, some of her inventions make Iron Man's creations pale in comparison. I expect to see more of her in future installments, if the post-credits scene is anything to go by. Seasoned veterans like Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, John Kani, and Sterling K Brown support the main cast with their renowned expertise. And not for the first time, Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis' scenes together are a delight to watch. While Freeman does provide some comic relief, it is also refreshing to see him get actively involved and bring his own skills to the table. <br/><br/>As for the crew, one important point first: bear in mind, the director is a relative newcomer in the competitive world of big-budget superhero franchises. I have not seen Fruitvale Station or Creed yet, but Ryan Coogler had a lot on his plate when entrusted with the enviable task of directing this highly-anticipated venture. He delivers a really watchable film, even if some adrenaline junkies might complain that the action sequences are few and far between. By choosing to focus on drama and intrigue instead of fast-paced, mind-numbing action (my number one reason for hating Avengers: Age of Ultron), Coogler makes a calculated move to pose questions about ourselves. His crew back him up admirably, whether it is Rachel Morrison with the camera (some of the wide-angle shots were gorgeous), special effects, or music. The production design is top-notch, the sweeping, high-tech interiors of Wakanda contrasting rather charmingly with the rustic, almost-idyllic outdoors. At just a touch over 2 hours long, the pace is neither too rushed nor sluggish.<br/><br/>My sincere advice to those who have not seen this film yet: if possible, erase the sky-high expectations caused by Marvel's hype-machine and watch for what it really is. You will probably enjoy it more.<br/><br/>8/10"

You really delve into the world of Wakanda a technological and cultural phenomenon. It is very well realised, the colour palette is great and there are some really nice shots.<br/><br/>Every single character is interesting and fun, although a few were one dimensional the actors somehow make up for it. Standouts were Chadwick Boseman, Andy Serkis and Winston Duke. When the tribal fights occur it just heightens the drama and I loved that. The Dora milage are also great too(okoye is a badass).<br/><br/>Not to mention this film had a spectacular soundtrack by Ludwig Goransson that stays true to African music while still having a twinge of hip hop beats. Best soundtrack since the winter soldier, had to stop my self dancing in my seat.<br/><br/>The 'villain' is compelling and presents an interesting discussion to be had in relation to Wakanda and sharing their wealth with others who need it. However, I did find the character of Killmonger tiring at times, he is a hot headed fool but eh.<br/><br/>My major gripes were really the CGI fight scenes and the first 20 minutes were almost awful, but when this film picks up boi does it pick up. The humour is also hilarious most of the time but a few jokes made me die inside *what ArE THooOse*<br/><br/>I genuinely don't understand how anyone can give this film 1s and 4s and in the same breath give other mcu films good scores and I love the MCU. I also can't help but notice a trend in the type of people who give it such scores, it's either that they are dc fanboys or right wing snowflakes just as there are left wing snowflakes.

1) Politics, yes its political the main character is a king so to rule his kingdom politics has to be involved.
2) Its a Superhero movie you go into it KNOWING the good guy will survive in the end.
3) Yes the current climate in America takes a form in the movie, because the movie takes place present day and these are REAL problems that face many Americans.<br/><br/>4)This is Marvel's best origin story followed closely by Iron Man and Ant Man. Since we were introduced to Black Panther in Civil War we finally get to see his homeland and how the Black Panther is chosen.<br/><br/>5) I can't remember too many other Marvel films showing villain development the way this one does. We learn more about the villain in this movie (though briefly) we at least know the bad guy didn't just pop-up out of no where.<br/><br/>6) There was plenty of action though the movie does have some slow parts, but so do a lot of movies.<br/><br/>7) The comedic timing is great, not Deadpool level, but a little better than the other MCU movies."

"cwalker-71066","10","6","17","28 February 2018"," Amazing cast & character development
","Coogler does an amazing job developing this film's protagonist and antagonist. T'challa's (Chadwick Boseman) character has so much depth to him and is challenged in so many ways as he tries to become the best king possible for Wakanda. It is amazing to see how much he matures from the beginning of the film to the end. This film's antagonist, Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), is everything you need a villain to be. His backstory is portrayed perfectly and it gives him understandable motives. Driven by those motives, he pushes T'challa to his limits. Whenever there is such a good antagonist like this, you get the most out of your protagonist.<br/><br/>As a result, T'challa is easily one of the most thought out/designed heroes currently in the MCU and has so much depth after this one movie! On the other hand, Killmonger, is quite possibly the best villain in the MCU.<br/><br/>Also have to mention: great supporting cast! The rest of the characters are so good that you are still entertained even when the previously mentioned characters are not on the screen.<br/><br/>10/10"
"jon.h.ochiai","10","6","17","21 February 2018"," Becoming Greater
","Although early in 2018, Writer and Director Ryan Coogler's ""Black Panther"" is one of the year's best. At least it shall be one of my favorites. ""Black Panther"" transcends the superhero movie genera that thrills and touches our souls. ""Black Panther"" is beautiful to behold with the majestic African landscape and seamlessly generated images of the futuristic culture of Wakanda literally hidden from the rest of the world. <br/><br/>The screen astounds in tragic physical battles or the shiny Lexus's racing through the night streets in Korea. Ryan along with co-writer Joe Robert Cole create inspired conversations of the sacrifices of becoming greater, forgiveness of betrayal, forsaking utopian isolationism for the greater good. ""Black Panther"" is the culture phenomenon. <br/><br/>""Black Panther"" tells the timeless tale of the Hero and the defining other. Chadwick Boseman is magnificent as T'Challa, who becomes the legendary Black Panther. T'Challa succeeds his murdered Father T'Chaka, played by John Kani, as King of Wakanda. Strikingly handsome Chadwick embodies grace and elegant swag. He distinguishes the hero in his action, his words, and in the power of his tears. <br/><br/>Michael B. Jordan plays mercenary ex-CIA operative Eric Killmonger, who defines T'Challa, the Black Panther. Michael is powerful as the suffering villain Eric. In Ryan's narrative and Michael's soulful being, we can't dismiss Eric as mere villain. He's human, too. Like T'Challa, Eric is both lightness and darkness. We all are. <br/><br/>Eric's tremendous rage sources from his unforgiving past. T'Challa realizes Eric horrific betrayal. In T'Challa's ""vision quest"", he confronts his Father. He cries, ""We were wrong!"" T'Challa perhaps is the greater man. His Father's words, ""And it's hard for a good man to be king.""- become his paradox. <br/><br/>Eric's suffering robbed him of compassion. Though his noble purpose is equality for all. Even the villain is not all darkness. ""Black Panther"" is eloquent resolution of the ideologies of T'Challa and Eric, each valuing courage and dignity in their own ways. Chadwick and Michael's conflict profoundly move us. T'Challa's tears touched my soul. <br/><br/>In the ""Black Panther"" mythology, Wakanda emerged when a meteor of made of Vibranium, the hardest metal known, crashes in Africa. Vibranium allowed the people of Wakanda to develop breakthrough technology, becoming the most advanced culture on Earth. Unbeknownst to everyone else. Wakanda is composed of five united tribes lead by the mythical Black Panther. The Black Panther is from the lineage of Kings, who with the serum of the indigenous plant possess great strength, speed, and agility. <br/><br/>T'Challa is the next Black Panther. His mother is nurturing Ramonda, played by strong Angela Bassett, who believes he shall be the great King. His sister is genius scientist Shuri, whimsically brilliant Letita Wright. Letita is the scene stealing star. Shuri is like T'Challa's ""Q"" creating the kinetic energy suit he wears among other weaponry. His ex-lover Nakia, played by strong beautiful Lupita Nyongo, is the spy gathering intelligence on the outside world. Amazing Danai Guria plays General Okoye, the powerful warrior guarding the Royal Family. <br/><br/>Arms dealer Ulysses Klaue, played by ruthless Andy Serkis, steals Vibranium threatening the revelation of Wakanda and its secrets. Eric is Klaue's mission leader. Klaue seemingly reveals the singluar narrative frailty. He is without nuance almost caricature. He serves as the plot device tying in charismatic Eric. <br/><br/>""Black Panther"" mesmerizes in stunning vibrant visual displays and the inspired battles of T'Challa and Eric. Ryan's words and story resonate. Nakia tells T'Challa, ""Only you can decide what kind of king you want to be."" What kind of person will you be? Who will you become? That inspired to make me to look within as well.<br/><br/>That's what is so special about ""Black Panther"". ""Black Panther"" dares you to choose the greater than path, becoming greater than you know yourself to be. To create and live in that greater space. And the world will be greater for it."
"elizhabib","8","6","17","18 February 2018"," A great addition to the Marvel universe that stands alone
","I made an account just to review this movie because I think it is worth the hype. If you haven't seen the numerous other Marvel movies, fear not. Black Panther stands on its own, and doesn't feel like an episode in a series like many of the other Marvel films. Most of the film takes place in Wakanda, an African dreamland that is both traditional and futuristic. When the film jumps to other locations around the world like London and South Korea (got to target that Asian market) I found myself wishing they would go back to Wakanda just because it is so visually stunning. The plot is solid and the actors are excellent. So much in fact, I wish they had spent more time on character development. The film seems to focus more on the villian, Killmonger, than the hero, T'Challa. I'm not complaining though, because Killmonger is an interesting character, and Michael B. Jordan is captivating. Black Panther brings up some heavy themes, and I think they could have gone further with them. Maybe in the sequels (I hope there will be sequels!) they will. The set design, costumes, and especially the music of Black Panther make it a joy to watch. I highly recommend it."
"sarah_mccully","9","15","55","16 February 2018"," Wakanda won me over!
","I was honored to receive an invite to attend an advanced screening of Marvel's latest release, ""Black Panther"". I will be honest I didn't know a lot about this character before reading about him recently and seeing the film. The story line crosses both racial and cultural lines which has made this super hero a fan favorite for more than 50 years and I really love him now too. He is a fierce fighter and is empathetic to those around him. He has a big heart and wants to do his very best.<br/><br/>T'Challa is haunted by the mistakes of his father and is also a flawed person but puts a lot of pressure on himself to be the best king he can be for his people. During his transformation to King he goes to the land of his ancestors and is able to have a brief talk with his father. His father assures him he will be a good king but it will be hard because he has a good heart. This is a weakness and something he has to figure out how to balance with his leadership and superhero roles. I really enjoyed watching Mr. Boseman as this character and he brought not only a fierceness to the role but also a sensitivity and a humor that was just so human and optimistic. Things might be hard but he tried to come with an openness and we saw more of that come to fruition as the movie progressed.<br/><br/>I loved the entire cast of this movie and felt like the right people were put into the right roles. I can't imagine anyone else playing these characters. The performances were incredibly strong although I definitely felt like Shuri, T'Challa's sister played by Letitia Wright, stole the show. I just loved her character! She was strong, funny and intelligent. She is the force behind inventing much of the Wakandan modern technology (if this was Bond, she would be Q) and most specifically the Black Panther suit. On top of all that, she is a character girls are going to look to and be inspired by. I really loved the chemistry between all of the characters and felt like they genuinely liked or loved each other. It didn't feel forced.<br/><br/>I felt like the action really kept in line with what is shown in other Marvel movies. In fact I felt like there was less fighting and violence in this film than in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and some of the other Marvel Studios films. There is sword play and a couple of scenes using guns but the most dramatic fight scenes are hand to hand battles for the throne.<br/><br/>After seeing this movie I couldn't help thinking back to last year and seeing the new ""Wonder Woman"". Seeing a woman yield such incredible power, yet being allowed to also be tender, hit me so hard. I walked away from Black Panther with the same feeling I had with ""Wonder Woman"". Seeing fierce, powerful, intelligent, tender women standing up and being a part of the action spoke to me and I cheered for them every time they picked up a spear or showed the technology they created or acted as advisers. I really liked that the women were treated as equals. There was equal ""saving of each other"", never portraying the women as weaker and needing help. They worked together. This spoke to the message at the end of the film that we all need to learn that we are one tribe on this earth and we all need to look out for each other. <br/><br/>We highly recommend the film!"

","I am Korean and come on. The Koreans in this movie couldn't speak Korean. The casino was in Chinese style. Not Korean. I know this is Hollywood production and no American will know the difference but there also are millions of Koreans watching this movie. Is it too much to ask?<br/><br/>The story was very unconvincing and predictable. They had Vibranium and superior technology for thousands of years, chose not to share it and hide inside the mountain? Not even try to conquer outside of Wakanda? Why? Are they trying to say black people are dumb?<br/><br/>Ancient Wakanda tradition to challenge for throne but they use UFC yield rule? Not fight till death? And once they lose, they don't accept? Didn't die and didn't yield so it doesn't count? What kind of tradition is this?

"anchoreddown","9","18","69","17 February 2018"," Marvel did it again!
","I had a small window of an opportunity to go see this movie opening day between things I had to do, and I'm glad I did. That's saying a lot from someone who's used to routines throughout the week.
They pack a lot into this chapter for the panther. I haven't taken the time to actually research the comic book character. Thankfully, there's plenty of exposition at the beginning, which is a good thing considering that there has been plenty of hype for each Marvel movie that comes out. It really helps the audience because this day in age, most people won't bother to do any research. For some movies, yes, you should get on Wikipedia or YouTube the character and see what pops up.
There's a lot that Black Panther is, and there's a lot that it isn't in the way of comic book adaptions. Marvel is getting better and better at keeping the superheroes fresh for the intended audience. The problem with DC is the way they've been handling their superheroes, but that's a whole different topic.
Yes, this is a bit of a political storyline, but at the same time the political side of the movie thankfully doesn't overpower the rest of it. There's plenty of action, ripped guys w their shirts off for the girls to leak their hormones all over, plenty of comedic moments and everything else in between. Martin Freeman's character is rather left hanging on as the comedic role, considering he's done this before w The Hobbit trilogy. 
As far as the culture of Wakanda, it's a mix between Iron Man's work and something you might see in Bruce Wayne's Bat-cave. Several parts made me think they could've used some of this technology in The Dark Knight trilogy. That is one impressive cave the panther has. The only thing that really stood out to me that was different was seeing that one guy who had that ornamental piece attached to his lip, ;-)
I've said it before, and I'll say it again, I've learned to stop reading reviews and what critics are saying about movies today because all they ever do anymore is shred the filmmakers to pieces. I want to be entertained, not to go into a theater to judge a movie. The rare exception would be sitting down to some Batman movie that would be similar to Batman & Robin. I'm a huge Bat-fan.
Well, I certainly enjoyed this entry in the MCU. Would probably get it when it's out on home video, or available for streaming off Amazon."
"chestern-80136","9","21","83","13 February 2018"," Exceeded expectations with very few flaws. Definitely one of my favourite Marvel films.
","I am a big comic fan. Both in the literal sense of my stature and weight, and in the extent in which I enjoy the medium. I rarely actually find time to read comics, despite having no real job or any other vacuum of time. Still, I can remember when I was younger and my attention span hadn't been eroded into nothingness. Back then, I had many favourite characters. There was the classics like Spider-Man, and the more niche choices such as Moon Knight. Somewhere in the middle was King T'Challa, or the Black Panther if you would prefer. <br/><br/>I won't go the full route of claiming that, since I am of mixed race, a character of a racial minority helped guide me and give me confidence, acting as my sole role-model. Still, though, it was quite interesting as a child seeing the other half of what I came from. Granted, my great-grandfather was Jamaican, but the concept remains the same. I don't believe there is a mixed race superhero (though do please correct me if I'm wrong) but I also don't really need one. When I heard that Black Panther movie was announced, I quickly became nervous. Obviously, I was elated that one of my childhood favourites would finally be getting a big-screen adaptation. Still, I was worried that the film would push politics into my semi-developed brain. Recently, there's been quite the surge of people demanding representation. Obviously, this should happen. Black people exist, and they should be shown in film. The same goes for everyone else, regardless of race, gender etc. Personally, however, I feel this has come at the expense of quality. Finn, the first main black character in Star Wars, is an embarrassment in my mind. While many applauded Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, I feel both her acting, and the film as a whole, were lacking. She simply fits the character well, allowing her to pass semi-believably. I was horribly nervous that Black Panther would be yet another casualty to this. I thought he might abide by all black stereotypes by being loud, emotional and overly aggressive. Much to my relief, this film seemed to understand this, and avoid it.<br/><br/>In the comics. T'Challa is a wise and level-headed king. Obviously, in the films, he is currently younger than he is often shown on the page, but these traits are still present. He is dignified and a strong leader, but isn't above enjoying himself every now and then. Unlike many other Marvel protagonists, T'Challa isn't cracking jokes mid-fight. He remains serious, grounded in the severity of the situations he finds himself in. He doesn't seem to find much pleasure in combat, he simply does it because, ultimately, it is often the right thing to do. The villain, on the other hand, is almost the polar opposite. In another film, Killmonger may well end up as the misunderstood Anti-hero protagonist. Here, however, he is treated as well intentioned but ultimately misguided. This is something I can respect. I was truly surprised by this film; I expected the protagonist and antagonist's personalities to be reversed, but I ended up with the film I didn't know I wanted.<br/><br/>The characters are quite wonderful. Both T'Challa and his younger sister Shuri are handled wonderfully, and I could actually believe their sibling bond. In fact, Shuri (despite one horribly misplaced attempt at reviving a meme) ended up being one of my favourite characters in the film. She wasn't a stereotypical 'strong and independant woman' character. She was both of those things, but she also had her own flaws and imperfections, separating her from the ranks of Rey and Diana Prince. The writing in addition to Letitia Wright's wonderful performance made for a great character I'd love to see more from. Michael B. Jordan has an odd place in my superhero-oriented mind. I doubt I can forgive him for 'Fant4stic' but his performance in this film almost changed my mind. His character as shown in the trailers looked incredibly forgettable and one-note, but in the film, it's a very different story. I shan't give any spoilers for those who are yet to see it, but I doubt anybody will be left disappointed. It was definitely a direction I hadn't expected both Marvel and Disney to go in, and I'm incredibly pleased by the mature and politically neutral choices.<br/><br/>I wasn't really a fan of Martin Freeman's character in Civil War (he was only really there to be in this, despite what his character's name may suggest) and he's perfectly serviceable in this. Honestly, rather ironically, he just seems to be here for diversity, in an attempt to show that not all white people are evil. Himself and Andy Serkis even took to calling themselves the marvellously titled 'Tolkien white boys'. Speaking of Mister Serkis, he seemed to be having an absolute blast. Each scene he was in was packed with energy. Unfortunately, he was horribly underused. I'd love to see him in some future films, as unlikely as it would seem.<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa, as I mentioned previously, was wonderful. I'm now nervous for Infinity War; I fear they may do the character an injustice by showing him too little, or writing him poorly. I do feel I can safely rule out the actor as a problem if anything goes wrong; this performance shows he can carry a film.<br/><br/>It's rare that I'd give a whole section of a review to this, but the action was brilliant. The climax of the film was overly busy for my tastes (there was basically three fights going on at once) but each aspect was given a great deal of detail. While I am a novice in the subject, I believe I saw various different forms of martial arts at play during various duels etc. It was pleasant seeing real technique used rather than the classic Marvel method of 'hit him really hard' or 'shoot a laser'. It was also incredibly brutal; there was blood used frequently, and each punch actually looked like it hurt. Towards the end, there was a moment where there really should have been blood, but I feel censorship may have intervened; they probably want as many people to see this film as possible, children included. Personally, I would have rather seen the climax come down to a simple duel to really show off the choreography and talent at play. Nevertheless, the film was thoroughly enjoyable.<br/><br/>The music was used incredibly intelligently. From the trailer, I feared it would all simply be rap music. I've nothing against the genre, but it wouldn't fit the comicbook character. To my relief, however, music was used incredibly intelligently. If you know of the musical 'Hamilton' you may understand. Within it, rap mostly follows the titular character, while the character of Aaron Burr is closer to RnB, featuring more vocal talent and soul rather than blisteringly quick verses. A similar technique is used here. T'Challa is accompanied by what I assume is classic African music, while Killmonger is followed by hiphop, fitting their characters brilliantly. Rather ironically, when the more traditional superhero music reared it's head, it was a disappointment. This film probably has the best music of any Marvel film. I'm actually considering buying the album by Kendrick Lamar in order to support the film further.<br/><br/>Even from a regular film perspective, I think this film succeeded. The cinematography was gorgeous at times. It occasionally fell into the more standard, dull, static shots, but for the most part, it was great. The visual effects were also, as to be expected, impressive. Much like Iron Man, I found myself longing for a suit of my own. (Any scientists reading, add this to the list. Along with real Pokemon and so on.)<br/><br/>There was a few minor inaccuracies and inconsistencies, but compared to how I feel about many Disney films nowadays, I feel this film was, to put it simply, a marvel. It might simply be because I am writing this right after seeing it, but this is probably one of my favourite Marvel films period. I daren't give a 10, lest I regret it later, so instead I'll give it a 9.5/10. It was the most fun I've had in a cinema watching a film like this since Logan. I wish to thank Ryan Coogler, the cast and crew for smashing my expectations and restoring some hope in the Marvel franchise. Black Panther is now in cinemas, and I implore you all to watch it. For anyone wondering, there is two end credits scenes. One in the middle, and one at the end.<br/><br/>(Completely unrelated, please be quite during a film viewing in the cinema? I appreciate this doesn't apply to 99.99% of you, so thanks, but while I watched this, there was a group of teenage girls behind me. They spoke through the entire film, so I now know which of the cast they'd most like to have sex with. Congratulations, I suppose, Mr. Jordan.)"
"dabbymaluenda","9","20","79","17 February 2018"," Much potential, good-enough execution. (Watch movie first).
","I rate Black Panther a solid 9. This is by far the most beautiful movie in Marvel, and the most original. This movie gives you a taste of ""The Lion King"", ""Avatar"", and some black nationalism. When one hears these three combined, you think ""wow!"" or ""how?"". You can tell the planned idea was genius, but the execution could have gone much better. Now I know you've read many reviews about how good this movie is; so my focus on this review is on how this movie had a larger potential, perhaps to be the best movie of the year.
If I was the director and saw the finished product, the evaluation phase, I would immediately contact a film scorer (someone like Han Zimmer), and ask him for some intense music. The Black Panther/King of Wakanda theme was good, the feel for Wakanda's new world was pleasant; however, the most essential, emotional moments were wasted without a doubt. A scene with a script and CGI is a nice square, but a film score brings volume; it creates a cube. If you remember the final Battle in ""Avatar"", you remember the intense music during the final battle. I need that for the final battle between Wakanda & Wakanda. Or if that sets the bar too high, at least add some of the trippy music from the trailer. Or ""La Tentation De Simba"" vibes from ""The Lion King"". I need some suspenseful music, I need a feeling of the end of relationships and the end of Wakanda. This battle was great, but a great background tone would have made it phenomenal. And not just the final battle, some ""Dark Knight"" notes for the interrogation scene perhaps. A huge improvement would've been a father-son relationship theme. Something like Mufasa's theme from ""The Lion King"". The one-on-one challenge fight between the Killmonger and Black Panther should have had a fast-paced score. How about when Black Panther was thrown off the river? Or when he came back to life? Now that is a lot of music for one movie; however, I did say this review is solely to explain Black Panther's potential. A script is the base of the tower, acting and CGI are the construction, music piles up height. Most, not all, scenes in this film should've had something playing externally, because music can fill in emotions actors simply can't.. Those are some ideas to what could've been Black Panther's film score.
Now a problem, believe it or not, that I found was Chadwick Boseman. The star of the show had some questionable acting scenes. My first issue is his acting performance as the son of the King, he really didn't express himself well. Me being a son of a father, realize that father-son relationships affect someone. And he really didn't express emotion towards it. There were many scenes with emotion: hype and action, death, betrayal, anxiety, stress, intellectual, etc. Chadwick Boseman almost felt like he either laughed with his sister, or he had a straight-serious face; in other words, he didn't express much emotion. Now I will give him credit for acting well on the scene where he found out his dad killed his uncle, and when Forrest Whitaker (I couldn't find his character's name) died. But for the rest of the movie I was just finding myself not caring for Black Panther's character, I didn't care for the main hero, the protagonist of the movie. I also have one more comment for Chadwick Boseman, he should've gotten ripped. I need him to look like Captain America in the movie. In his initiation as a king, I was pretty surprised the Black Panther had no calves, he seemed wimpy for a superhero. So if you ask me how this movie could have gone better, I feel Chadwick's performance was a big let-down for the sentiment of the story.
The last thing, literally, to be covered is the final battle. I mentioned the film score that should've been added to the last battle, not the script nor the action. To me the last moments in Wakanda should've gone like how Avatar played on: rise in hype, loss of hope, final 1v1. And in a way the movie played this way, but Avatar's exciting battle also had beautiful creatures and wonderful visual effects. This was a chance to shoot for the stars, and Ryan Coogler missed it. He brought rhinos, but this is Wakanda, I need elephants, lions, panthers (like honestly am I the only one that thought of this), eagles, etc. Bring Africa to life in the last 20 minutes. I assure that would have gone in the books, as the most epic, final showdown. I feel the sky battle between pilots felt like a waste since it wasn't the most amazing thing, it had a cool ending, but it doesn't feel as great if the rest wasn't epic. Like I said before, add some sick music, and show the best of Wakanda that is shown in the comics. And for crying out loud, shoot a scene with Black Panther on top of the rock like in ""The Lion King"" once he wins the battle, with the people of Wakanda praising him. Do it for the fans. I liked the 1v1 at the end, and the falling scene. I enjoyed watching Killmonger against 5 different skilled women. I loved when Black Panther DESTROYED a spaceship with a vibranium spear. I just felt there was space for improvement, to make something competitive to Avatar's final battle. I'm only here to comment on it's potential.
Anyways those are some thoughts on how the movie could have improved. The movie is great as it is, but it almost feels like marvel didn't want it to be the greatest Marvel film. If these 3 elements had been added, no doubt in my mind this movie would have been the best in Marvel, perhaps the best of the year. And simply a revolutionary, example to be, superhero film."
"Ingrouille181","7","11","38","15 February 2018"," The last MCU movie I'm seeing in theatres, but I don't think it left it on a high note
","After watching Guardians 3, I told myself that Black Panther would be the last MCU film I'd watch. For one, I had become a DC fanboy, and two, the MCU formula had gotten pretty stale and repetitive. But, after seeing Civil War, I kept remembering Black Panther, and the fact that his father had been killed, leaving him as the new ruler of the mysterious Wakanda. That could set up something great for a Black Panther movie. If the teaser was at least half good, I'd see it. Not only was the teaser and the second trailer great, but the actors chosen blew my mind. Forest Whitaker, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Michael B. Jordan, all great choices.<br/><br/>The story: Following the assassination of king T'Chaka in Civil War, T'Challa is the new king of Wakanda, the mysterious nation that's hiding untold treasures and technological Marvels. The story follows T'Challa rise to become worthy as king, all the while having to face off against a new enemy, Eric Killmonger, who plans to take the throne, his power and his secrets,<br/><br/>I love the look of Wakanda; the culture shows that while Wakandan's are technologically advanced, they also integrate that into their culture and clothing. I think Ryan Coogler did a great job with the look and feel of Wakandan culture. Some of the new characters are great editions. T'Challa's mother Ramonda, his sister Shuri, his best friend W'Kabi. I even enjoyed Nakia, Nyong'o's character. Shuri had to be my favourite, and I really liked all the tech she created; that projection/hologram suit she made was amazing. I also enjoyed the Dora Milaje, the all women guard T'Challa had; you really feel their devotion and loyalty to Wakanda.<br/><br/>But yes, there are things I was disappointed with in this film, one way or the other. One thing I was disappointed about was how little we got to see of T'Challa's kingship. All the advertisement is telling you ""his time is now"", ""get ready for a new king"". I was watching this film waiting for T'Challa to ""take charge"" and show us why he's worthy, but the only real thing that makes him worthy I guess is that he's royalty. I wanted something like Thor where he's stripped, and proves himself worthy but sacrificing his life. I guess we have that by the end, but I wanted that to be his whole character arc. Overall, he's crowned king after beating this Ape tribe leader in a duel, goes to capture Klawe at a casino, and immediately faces Killmonger, loses, is revived, and goes back to defeat him. That's all well and good, but I needed something more than that to scream ""he's the true, inspiring king we need"". If the last 20 minutes are defining that, then some, naming I, was a little disappointed.<br/><br/>Overall, an entertaining movie, and interesting edition to the MCU. I love Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa. I love the look of Wakanda, Vibranium, and all the technology Wakanda is hiding. T'Challa could have been developed a bit more, but at least I care about his character now. Even though this film didn't win me back to the MCU, I'm glad I watched it. Wouldn't really watch it again though.<br/><br/>I'm giving this a 7 out of 10"
"dcbman-55437","9","21","84","13 February 2018"," Pure awesomeness!
","I'm a general Marvel fan, but even this blew my expectations away! I had my doubts as I saw the insanely-high Metacritic rating, but all of my fears were proven wrong when I attended a special screening of it. The action, cinematography and effects are great as usual, but it also has something many Marvel critics beg for: a right mix of humor, story, dark tone, and character. It doesn't rely on huge doses of humor as an excuse to cover it's story (like Thor Ragnarok, as much as I liked that), but instead gives each and every character a chance to grow and mature for us to care about. The story also has many interesting themes and twists, as does the social commentary about race. My only complaint was a few wonky CGI moments and an underwhelming villain, but otherwise Black Panther had enough to offer for anyone of any age to enjoy. Finally, an action movie with substance! 9.5/10"

","I loved watching this. The cast and the plotline all of that was beautiful. The one problem I did have with this film is ""it glorified destructive and misleading stereotypes that are actually injurious to the African diaspora today."" The black girl nutures the safe Caucasian - typical. The black woman is fierce and combative to the man she loves - typical. African vs African American - ""Not Cool."" This film recieved so much praise for being a 'breakthrough' film for Africans and I would have been able to appreciate completely if it did glorify injurious realities that have disadvantaged and even mentally enslave african people to inferior freedom as a people globally and carry forward the status quo just with a most black cast this time. So for me it was ""a good effort"" and gets a 10 for progress and quality. However, it was a miss on the message and left something for future projects to aspire to correct. I can't board 'The social media bandwagon' on this one but I see you Black Panther."

I loves it because the characters are so well developed (and Shuri is awesome- she's so funny!). Every character seems to have glaws and strengths and their interactions with other characters are genuine. I loved the viduals and the effects, they made Wakanda technology look incredible and I really wish I could live in that world. All the scenes were beautifully scripted and I particularly liked how there were elements of humor in among some of the fight scenes. However, this is a more serious movie than recent marvel movies have been like Thor Ragnarok and Spiderman Homecoming, but that just means that it is even more meaningful and important. In my opinion, the movie had a really interesting message (that I won't say because I don't want to spoil it).<br/><br/>I would and have previously recommended this movie to every one I know, and I think it deserved all the success that it has."

","I have been reading comics since the age of 7 - over 45 years ago - and Black Panther and Luke Cage just happen to be two of my favourite superheroes. 
Back then I didn't know why, but as time went by I looked back and realised that it had a lot to do with the fact that they look like me. 
As a kid, sometimes when I found myself in a sticky situation, I'd get confidence by thinking ""What would T'Challa do""? Well, it worked, and here I am nearly half a century later and seeing a different generation experiencing what I did then, through an updated format I couldn't even dream would have been possible. 
 
Now this movie may not have the best storyline, CGI or acting. However, that is irrelevant to a new generation of kids who are looking for imaginative inspiration. 
So while they will get the real world heroes role models from President Obama to Oprah, they need to see the ones in the world of the imagination as well...and Black Panther steps right into that gap.<br/><br/>Wakanda forever!!"

","I've been a Marvel fan all my life, and I've practically grown up watching the films. I went in to Black Panther expecting the usual Marvel humor, and the sometimes basic plot. But this movie blew away my expectations. Not only did everything look spectacular, the story flowed well, the actors all had an amazing performance, the soundtrack itself was great, and it was honestly a refreshing Marvel movie. The humor wasn't cheesy, but also not absent. My biggest compliment for it would be that it did not feel like a superhero movie. This movie was not about T'challa the superhero. It was about T'challa the king. And I loved that."

Just everything about his character gave me goosebumps-every time i saw him on the screen. Unfortunately, I was not able to watch the movie in IMax, but after watching it one time in standard, I would very much want to experience the ""IMax experience"" for this movie.

You know who will win, just get it over with. However, somehow with this movie I cared about each of the fights, and I was on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>It was very interesting to see an all-black (mostly) cast, and to see the African theme. I was impressed with the depth and meta aspect too - it presents two possible ways to address injustice - which path will these people choose? Great lessons here, besides just action and adventure.<br/><br/>For such a great movie, how to explain all the user ratings of 1, 2 and 3? It certainly doesn't deserve those.

","Great film and meaningful addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A lot of imdb reviewers have given this film a much lower score than it deserves, citing they don't like the ""politics"" of the movie. Interesting the same isn't being said of X-men or other Marvel films given their superheroes have always been political, but I digress. I suppose that once immersed in a world filled with black excellence and gender equality, it is easy for some to forget that race is ""political"" for all people of color. This film's box office success is reflective of how deeply it resonates with people all over the world. Those who allow themselves to accept the viewpoints of others who aren't white will likely find some of the film's universal themes of grief, family, pain, and identity resonating with them as well."
"Quinoa1984","9","6","18","3 March 2018"," One of the better Marvel movies
","What does empowerment mean for black people? While this is not exactly the central question for T'Challa, there is a part of this question for him. He has to not only be a king but know how to do it. Does he stay an isolationist, clinging to the world he was raised in and all of the vibranium included, or share the knowledge and tech with the world? Information and resources, wealth, science, that leads to people becoming empowered because they have what they didnt.<br/><br/>This is in direct contrast with another kind of empowerment, through dominance and wiping out oppressors, and that is what Killmonger represents. But does he come from some place that is inhuman? Not really; Eric is from a world of pain, of heartache and loss, and by how he decided what made the most sense - getting jacked and becoming a super-soldier (no, not that one, sans what Captain America's got) - it charted how he saw becoming a ruler. Can one become empowered through revolution? It's arguable, and that's the key thing. ""Kill white""? He wouldn't be the first, or the last.<br/><br/>But Killmonger (what a name) is the villain when all is said and done because he doesn't see change being possible in others, whether white or black or whomever. All he sees is the chaos and anger of the world, and sees it as a personal struggle. I didn't see it right off on the first viewing until Double Toasted in their review pointed to it, but there is a stark Trump parallel one could make with Jordan's character.... Though with a bit more of the Malcolm X and less of the, you know, white supremacist side. But then again, supremacy is supremacy and so is demagoguery.<br/><br/>These sound like some heavy concepts for a Marvel movie and they are, but the brilliance or Coogler's movie is that he smuggles (or it may just be out in the open and direct) in an action-filled spy epic with Shakespearean overtones (and all the soap-opera that comes with Mr Shakespeare and his royalty epics). This doesn't mean it's without some flaws, both technical (there's some poor CGI in the third act, and in other parts too, though not all bad), and in the plot (mostly in some familiarity with Winston Duke's character, though he fills him with personality to burn). I'm not even sure it hit me emotionally as Civil War or Iron Man as far as Marvel movies go.<br/><br/>But as far as movies I've rated a 4.5 out of 5, this is one of the better ones. It has a lot on it's mind, and it has a great way of bringing these ideas to the largest possible audience - not to mention, with both race and gender representation - it's the most woke movie ever made."

"neobateman","6","9","31","17 February 2018"," A combination of a political character study and a superhero extravaganza that doesn't always mix.
","Black Panther is the newest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Chadwick Boseman reprises his role from Captain America Civil War. The rest of the picture also features an great ensemble of well known actors. These include Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis. All of whom give serviceable performances. After the events of Civil War, T'Challa (Boseman) returns to his home Wakanda, a land that is deeply hidden within the African forest. Wakanda has been hidden from the majority of the world for centuries, Challa has to make a choice when an unexpected enemy comes to take his place. Boseman plays Challa / Black Panther with a mixture of wisdom, patriotism but also a lack of experience when it comes to the world. This is a interesting combination that really pays off when T'Challa meets with the main villain of the film played by Michael B. Jordan. The idea of a advanced culture with innovative technology that remains hidden from the world is very interesting. The majority of people from Wakanda believe that this makes the world a better place. However when Killmonger shows up these ideas are challenged through his character. Killmonger is the best villain the MCU has had since Loki, this is because both T'Challa and Killmonger can learn a lot from each other. This aspect is easily the best thing about Black Panther, unfortunately the film only becomes compelling after we pass the first act. The first act consists of a generic superhero plot in which T'Challa and his team race after Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) in order to capture him. This is important for the story in the long run but left me very emotionally empty. It also gives very little attention to Killmonger who only becomes interesting after the first hour. There is plenty of humour in Black Panther, the best jokes in the film came from Shuri (Letitia Wright) who plays the sister of T'Challa. She added plenty of self awareness that made myself and the all of the audience roar in the theatres. Unfortunately Black Panther also suffers from the same issues that Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2 and Thor Ragnarok suffered from and that is the fact that jokes are implemented in the wrong scenes. Sometimes a scene is meant to be serious until a character cracks a joke killing the impact of the scene. The action scenes also let me down, most of the them were too cgi heavy and I would've prefered some more realistic stunt work (but that's personal taste), especially because the director's previous film Creed had one of the sleekest looking fight scenes of recent years. Many of the special effects in Wakanda also felt unfinished, the look itself were breathtaking. However there were many set pieces that felt incomplete and too cartoony. The costumes and music of the film is terrific though, they really give this exotic african feel, it makes the film a lot more authentic. After the first hour passed, I really enjoyed this picture. There were some minor gripes with special effects and tone, but for the most part I had a lot of fun with it."

"umashankarpati1997","8","13","50","18 February 2018"," T'Challa is the superhero of Wakanda. Best MCU movie till date.
","The hero of the tale is, of course, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the king of Wakanda and, as the Black Panther, protector of his people. Having drunk the nectar of a mystical flower, he has the strength of many men; in a suit woven of bullet-proof vibranium, he is virtually indestructible. (That's the Marvel part.) Indeed, Wakanda itself is built on the bounty of a meteorite bearing vibranium-the strongest metal on Earth-that struck Africa millennia ago. Technologically advanced beyond the dreams of any other nation, Wakanda cloaks itself from the world behind an illusory rainforest. As far as the rest of the world knows, it is a ""third-world country-textiles, shepherds, cool outfits.""<br/><br/>As the new king-his father having been killed in Captain America: Civil War, the movie that first introduced Black Panther-T'Challa is supported, and occasionally hindered, by an assortment of family, colleagues, and rivals: his younger sister, Shuri (Letitia Wright), a precocious tech genius who outshines even Tony Stark; his regal mother, Ramonda (Angela Bassett); the kingdom's high priest, Zuri (Forest Whitaker); T'Challa's best friend and chief of the border guard, W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya); the surly chief of a rebellious clan, M'Baku (Winston Duke); his chief general and head of the Dora Milaje, an all-female royal honor guard, Okoye (Danai Gurira); and T'Challa's former flame, Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), who is also a covert agent for the Dora Milaje.<br/><br/>As with any superhero movie, there are a handful of smaller-scale fights leading to one large-scale melee that is completely bonkers (complete with armored, rambunctious African wildlife), but the best parts of the movie fall in the spaces between those fights. T'Challa's royal blood makes him the rightful heir to the throne, and with that great power comes a set of great challenges - or rather, one great challenge that dictates every other challenge he's about to face.<br/><br/>But Black Panther isn't just T'Challa's story. It's also Killmonger's, He's a lost son whose father was killed by the king, and that king prevented him from achieving his birthright and destiny.
The plot and the story connects well. 
Kendrick Lamar's score is amazing. Andy Serkis is the show stealer. M'Baku is hilarious.
The humor is well fitted in the story which actually suits the process. No useless humor. Action sequences are kickass. 
Coming to the cons this movie it's that the climax plot was a bit predictable. But the pros do cover up this small con.
So For a superhero origin movie it's a good start.
A must watch. WAKANDA FOREVER."

"Hellmant","10","10","36","16 February 2018"," One of Marvel Cinema's best movies.
","'BLACK PANTHER': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The eighteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, based on the Marvel Comics character Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman reprises the title role (who first appeared in 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR'), and the movie costars Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Andy Serkis, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett and Forest Whitaker. It was directed by Ryan Coogler, who also helmed the critically acclaimed hits 'FRUITVALE STATION' and 'CREED' (which also both starred Jordan), and it was written by Coogler and Joe Robert Cole (based on characters created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby). The story revolves around the African superhero returning home to the nation of Wakanda, where he is now king, but his leadership is challenged by a new enemy. The film has received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's being called (by some) a revolutionary cultural movement (in much the same way that 'WONDER WOMAN' was last year). It's also projected to break records at the Box Office, and become Marvel Cinema's biggest hit to date. I really enjoyed it as well. <br/><br/>The story begins right after the end of 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR', with T'Challa (Boseman) returning home to the African nation of Wakanda. Since his father was killed, T'Challa is named the new king of Wakanda. At the same time a Wakandan exile, going by the name of Killmonger (Jordan), has aligned himself with a South African black-market arms dealer, named Ulysses Klaue (Serkis), and is plotting to overthrow T'Challa. T'Challa, as the superhero Black Panther, attempts to stop Klaue from stealing more vibranium (while unaware of Killmonger's involvement). Two female special forces agents (Nyong'o and Gurira), CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Freeman), and T'Challa's teenage sister Shuri (Wright), all end up aiding him on this mission.<br/><br/>I have to agree that this is one of Marvel Cinema's best movies, and I think it's cultural significance (and popularity) is really inspiring too. While I don't think it's quite as good a film as 'WONDER WOMAN' is, it's still a masterpiece in it's own right. It's great that superhero movies (in general) are becoming such a respected, and revolutionary art form too. Haters will of course still hate the film (as they did 'WONDER WOMAN' as well, and anything that creates such powerful progress like this), but everyone else should definitely enjoy it (unless you just really hate superhero movies). The action scenes are spectacular, the performances are all good, the humor is clever and witty, and the dramatic scenes are moving (and briefly touching too). Coogler once again proves what a talented director he is, and he appears to be the perfect filmmaker for this important movie."

","Yes the movie has some issues. Accents and languages and a few characters deserve some fleshing out, but a lot of the confusion about the plot comes from lack of knowledge.<br/><br/>And normally I would never write a review but I feel there are either so many very young people of color and non-people of color that miss the plot, simply because they are not part of the culture they are viewing on screen. The movie's core was a long standing unspoken discomfort (putting it lightly) between American black people and Africans. This movie took some of those discomforts and pain and put it front and center. Those of us who have seen and understand that very convoluted ""thing"" understand what we were seeing. It's essentially the parent (Wakandans or Africans)that left the child (Killmonger or black Americans), the child was abused, left to fend for themselves, and then the child growing to see that not only did the parent leave them, but the parent was happy, comfortable and did not care about all the evil that had befallen them.<br/><br/>And on the other side is the parent who had no idea, what happened, but assumed from what they had seen from afar, the child had every opportunity and decided to just not take them. The child instead decided to be a menace. Therefore the parent has a negative view of that child and really doesn't want to be associated with them in any way.<br/><br/>What happens when they meet up? T'Challa and Killmonger in the throne room.<br/><br/>Hate it if you must, but this storyline has never been on screen before. This painful under current has never been publicly mentioned. And I can see why it could confuse. But people of color, both Africans and black people, got it..and it's started a wonderful discussion. If any of you are confused and care to learn, a quick spin around YouTube to look at videos on what Africans think of black Americans, would start to give you some insight. If not, then oh well...you're going to be confused about a lot of non Anglo movies in coming years."

I was pleasantly surprised to see that, although it did touch on serious issues in America, it did so in a respectful and humanistic manner. It wove these issues into the motivation for our antagonist, who joins the ranks of a new breed of villain in cinema; a villain who the audience can relate to.

"classicsoncall","8","3","7","12 June 2018"," ""Every breath you take is mercy from me.""
","When I read the reviews of these super-hero movies I begin to wonder what the haters expect. Even with the film's generally high rating, a lot of the individual reviews bash this film for whatever reason, whether it's the story line, the CGI, the acting, take your pick. For me, it was a super-hero action flick that served well in that capacity, even if some of the elements are derivative of other sources. Certainly the costuming and cinematography is expertly done, and the character motivations are developed well enough to distinguish the good guys from the bad guys. If there's a bone to pick it's with the screenwriters, I would have preferred less of the modern day tendency toward globalization that the picture fosters. Though the villain Erik Stevens/Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) made a compelling case for T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) and the rest of Wakanda to share their wealth, knowledge and resources with the rest of the world, I didn't see it as their obligation to do so. But the irony is, after all the fighting, death and destruction, T'Challa eventually wound up coming around to that side of the argument, which made Killmonger a martyr for no cause. <br/><br/>Once again, it was good to see Black Panther creator and Marvel Comic guru Stan Lee in a spot cameo as a casino patron in South Korea. The credits list him as a 'thirsty gambler', which makes it sound like he was some kind of lush but it didn't appear that way in the picture. I think my favorite character in the story was Letitia Wright's Shuri. She was smart, feisty, and dedicated to her brother and her country, and it didn't hurt that she looked like someone I know. A remarkable resemblance actually, and if I didn't know better, I'd think that Black Panther might live right down the street from me."

","Black Panther, the movie, was brilliant. From the themes, to the story, to the CGI and the incredible costumes, sets and photography, it transported the viewer to a virtual feast! 
The theme of good vs evil is nuanced by the characters who are flawed and full of passion. The storyline is almost too true, because relatives are often the warring factions in the desire to rule. The hero, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), is both tempered and empowered by knowledge of history, diplomacy and the super-strength arising from a combination of an herb drink and the verbanium (bullet proof) suit. 
Each character is unique. M""Baku (Winston Duke) stood out with his arrogance and compassion; his strength and moral compass-a delightful break from the expectation of a villainous competitor for the throne. 
The genius Scientist sister, Shuri (Letitia Wright), offers both technology to engender envy in James Bond and intelligent humor as a sibling sidekick. 
Michael B. Jordan's vulnerable and self-confident portrayal of the villain-relative with his viable grief and a passion to gain what he believed he was entitled to, offers the chance for a healing even in death. 
Okoye, played so well by Danai Gurira, she dominated every scene-drawing my eyes to follow her every action. Lithesome and sinewy with an athletic prowess any girl might crave, she makes the essence of womanhood desirable, and baldness alluring. Amazons, move over!
So many actors enriched the drama. So fun to actually see Andy Serkis (Ulysses Kaue) with a human face. Zuri (Forrest Whitaker) compels us to see both sides of honor and dishonor. Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) brought a quiet strength to the future queen. Angela Bassett's queen mother, Ramonda, brings her understated elegance as a supportive mom to the role. 
The writers drew me into the story and made me want to visit Wakanda, with the rich colors and textures, technology balanced by logic and humanity. The struggle to share knowledge, when you know that some might turn things into war and destruction instead of building up families and traditions. 
As a WASP, I was glad to see that Martin Freeman's CIA character, Everett K. Ross, was welcomed ultimately, cuz I'd hate to be left out. Don't we all want to be a part of Wakonda?
Wakonda forever!"

","After years of the same Marvel movie over and over (aside from a couple slight detours), Cooglar has managed to meaningfully evolve the Marvel formula. Black Panther is alive and fresh.

"patrickp2001","9","3","7","17 March 2018"," I don't understand how I'm reading so many negative reviews
","Walking into this film, I'll admit I was rather skeptical. I was hesitant to buy all the hype, because I thought that people liked this movie only because it was the first black main character in the MCU and one of few blockbusters to take place in Africa. However, I was very pleasantly surprised by a dynamic and compelling film with layered themes and intriguing characters that largely sets itself apart from most superhero films. Ryan Coogler, who directs this film brilliantly as expected, creates a fascinating world for the story that is both cultural and innovative. The script is also fantastic, with a concise plot structure and good dialogue. The script establishes complex characters who are flawed but sympathetic, and who all are simply fighting for what they feel is right. What this film accomplishes most impressively is the main conflict between T'Challa and the main villain Killmonger. I was very mad reading reviews that criticized the villain, saying that ""we need to hate the villain, or else we won't root for the hero."" But what this does is create two-dimensional characters and a boring, by the numbers conflict based off simplistic good vs evil. Instead, by providing a sympathetic character with motives we understand and a hero who's flawed, we're simply seeing two human beings in an ideological conflict, similar to the relationship between Joker and Batman in The Dark Knight. Personally, I think this was a great film that I consider one of the best MCU movies I've seen so far (comparible to Civil War, Thor:Ragnarok and the first Guardians of the Galaxy), with compelling characters, brilliant acting and well-executed action scenes. Definitely worth a watch."

"connor-21167","7","3","7","20 February 2018"," ""Black panther or African dreamland""
","At beginning, let me clarify I am an greedy DC fan. In my vision, Black panther is the Marvel version of Batman. So, before seeing the movie, I didn't have any high expectations to this character. Just another version of Batman.
But let's face it - this is an different movie. 
First of all, whole film some feeling would get a hold in my mind. Am i watching a modern interpretation of Lion King or Marvel version of Agent 007 ? 
I've read reviews that call this the best Marvel movie ever, but I found it to be a pretty average Marvel movie. And at the same time, a classy DISNEY film. That is not to say it is bad, but film where Black Panther supposed to get his own movie, not about his character a bit disappointed me. They focused way too much on portraying a political, racial, African cultures and futuristic African dreamland ""Wakanda"". Where illustrated how powerful black people are, even females in this movie were intelligent and extremely courageous. #feminism The Black Panther character was used just only as driving force to next scene. Despite this issue, the plot is solid and the actors are excellent. Especially Michael B. Jordan character (Killmonger) who provides a great contrast with a potent motivation. I can say, one of interesting villains in Marvel universe. Other characters are just complimentary for this movie. 
As usually Visual effects and CGI were stunning, there was a little gaps with some poor lighting, but probably problem accrued from quality of our local Cinema. <br/><br/>6 out of 10 (If i have to classify this film as Marvel film) 
8 out of 10 ( as Disney film)"
"chaddevilletaylor","6","3","7","19 February 2018"," The villain did me in.....
","The movie itself was pretty good, if not politically charged, but what can you expect these days. I think the character development fell short and disliked the intro/explanation thing that went on near the start of the movie. There was plenty of action and great female supporting cast, the FBI agent guy not so much. The big drag was the villain, the character was poorly developed, shallow, he almost didn't even fit in the movie it was so bad. He did have some cool tribal markings though."
"garethvk","9","18","75","14 February 2018"," Marvel Has Done It Again
","The latest film in the Marvel Universe has arrived with ""Black Panther"" and it continues the tradition of big budgeted event films from Marvel. The film follows T'Challa (Chadwick Bodeman), as he prepares to assume the throne of the country of Wakanda after the death of his father. He is destined to lead over a nation that to the outside world seems impoverished and rural, but is secretly a very technologically advanced society thanks to their Vibranium resources. The resources allow them to keep their capitol city hidden from the world.
As T'Challa attempts to assume the throne and rule over the various tribes of his country; a threat from his past both known and unknown arises. Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) surfaces, T'Challa mounts and effort to bring him to justice which in turn sets a chain of events into motion. A mysterious and deadly figure known as Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), plans to obtain the Vibranium to exact a plan of revenge so severe it will lead to the nations of the world being subjugated and will divide even the most loyal citizens of Wakanda.
T'Challa must use his powers as The Black Panther and guardian of Wakanda to save his people and the very world from a threat that holds the fate of the world in the balance.<br/><br/>The film takes a while to get going as Director/Co-Writer Ryan Coogler takes his time introducing audiences to the world of Black Panther and especially the various characters. The strong supporting cast features Lupita Nyong'o, Angela Bassett, Danai Gurira, Forest Whitaker, Martin Freeman, and so many others that it is great to see such well-rounded characters.<br/><br/>The film does take a while to get up to the action but when it arrives; it delivers making the wait worth it. What I really liked was that the characters were well-defined as were their motivations. You did not have some cartoon mega-villain with some insane scheme, but rather a realistic and believable threat whose motivations were understandable though misguided.
Marvel has again delivered a very thrilling story that fits well into their extended universe and you will want to make sure to stay through all the credits for the two additional scenes which sets up future events for the Marvel Universe. ""Black Panther"" is a rousing success all around continues Marvel's Cinematic Universe in grand style.<br/><br/>4.5 stars out of 5"

"jwjpasion","10","6","19","18 February 2018"," This is something new and fresh brought to the giant MCU table
","What is with all the hate for this movie from people who haven't even seen it yet? BLACK PANTHER IS OUTSTANDING!!! This movie is not unique because it's a movie about the first Black superhero ever created, or anything else of racial matters. Rather, tt has qualities that surpass many other Marvel or superhero films and makes a really compelling story with some outstanding qualities in terms of its characters, dialogue, tension, set design, and action .
Perhaps the most outstanding aspect that Black Panther has to offer is it's use and development of characters, and the well written dialogue. Like most other Marvel movies, it has some pretty funny lines, but many of the scenes and dialogue are serious and the tension you feel while watching it is great, even if there's no action going on, because the actors are doing a great job. And every single character is likable and useful to the story and none of them are pointless nor useless (*cough cough*Last Jedi). You really care about all these characters no matter what their ideals or motivations are, and they all fit perfectly in the story with their own set of unique purposes. And this goes especially for the main villain , Killmonger, who has very clear motivations and are developed and told in the story in brilliant fashion. You feel for and understand his struggles and is a much more important and outstanding villain than pretty much any other Marvel villain, who are mostly just disposable and forgettable. My personal favorite is Shuri because she's a very likable character being T'Challa's younger sister with her witty comments and you know how much she loves her brother when she helps him with her technological knowledge and assistance as he goes through his struggles and challenges to become the new King of Wakanda. 
Another aspect of the film that is also outstanding is the action sequences and set design . The set design and color palette are much more improved nd defined than a loth of other Marvel films, and there much to appreciate about the set up of Wakanda and it really feels like it actually exists in the real world. Sure, some of the green screen effects/CGI are kind of noticeable but for me that doesn't really doesn't distract me from how much amazing tension there is in the action sequences. Every fight/battle (especially in the climax) are thrilling and are done so well that it pulls you in to it's majesty. I felt some shivers and shakiness from these action sequences because they are brilliantly directed. 
And one last outstanding topic to cover: this movie does well on it's own and it not forgettable. Sure, it's the movie right before Infinity War and could've been just a set up movie for that .but no, it really stands out as it's own story, and with little to no ties to other Marvel movies and does not waste time setting up Infinity War or anything like that. In fact, you don't really need to watch any other marvel movies prior to this one because Black Panther works on its own as a great, almost game changing experience. Even though it's not perfect and it does kinda feel bland a little bit in the first act, it goes above and beyond towards the second and third act with all of it's action, tension, character development, and dialogue to make probably the most thoughtful and well-written/directed Marvel movies to date. Props to Ryan Coogler, the screenwriters, and all the actors who made Black Panther happen. Wakanda Forever!!!"
"shawneofthedead","10","12","47","15 February 2018"," This may be Marvel's 18th film, but it feels like the studio is just getting started. Brave and brilliant, this superhero movie is like nothing you've ever seen before.
","Superhero movies never get a fair shake. There's always been an invisible - but undeniable - whiff of critical disdain attached to films revolving around people with superhuman abilities. More often than not, these films are viewed (and assessed) as popcorn entertainment: good fun, but not objectively good. Even the best examples of the genre are rarely, if ever, taken seriously by critics or award shows. But all that is set to change with Black Panther - a bold, brilliant blockbuster teeming with ideas, characters and messages that will make your soul take flight. For once, it's no exaggeration to say that you've never seen or experienced anything like this before.<br/><br/>The film gets off to a somewhat sedate start, as we're re-introduced to T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the freshly crowned King of Wakanda who is also infused with the ancestral powers of his nation's panther god. Writer-director Ryan Coogler takes his time in introducing us to all the key players in the film's first act, from the most important members of T'Challa's royal court to the rites, rituals and rigidity of Wakanda itself. <br/><br/>It's never boring, but Black Panther does linger in a minor key for a while. You might find yourself wondering just where the film is going, as T'Challa deals with a challenge to his authority from within Wakanda's five tribes. It can be hard to imagine, too, just what the film wants to say when T'Challa - who could easily delegate the responsibility - takes it upon himself to personally hunt down dastardly arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) in order to retrieve a stolen artifact made of Wakanda's most precious natural resource, vibranium.<br/><br/>But put your trust in Coogler - he's certainly earned it with his masterful blending of tension, character and story in his previous two films, Fruitvale Station and Creed. As Black Panther unfolds, everything starts to make a whole lot of sense, in dramatic, emotional and narrative terms. Suddenly, we're not just witnessing the growing pains of a new king. As it turns out, Black Panther is, for its titular character, an existential odyssey: as he fights for his nation's survival, T'Challa must also grapple with the choices (and sins) of his ancestors, deciding whether to embrace or reject them. <br/><br/>Most significantly, Black Panther uses its blockbuster platform to examine complex issues such as racism and colonialism in thoughtful, intimate ways. The fiction of Wakanda - a hyper-evolved African nation that has kept its technological advances a secret from the rest of the world for centuries - allows Coogler to hold up a mirror to the facts of the world in which we live. In quite unprecedented fashion, we are presented with a host of proud, brave, indomitable African warriors who have lived their lives free of the horrors of slavery and institutionalised racism. Just as Wonder Woman gave little girls the world over a hero in their own image, Black Panther will do the same for generations of black children who have never before seen themselves represented on screen.<br/><br/>If that sounds impossibly weighty and grim, don't worry. Coogler's script, co-written with Joe Robert Cole, is far from preachy. There may be a hint or two of hand-wringing melodrama to T'Challa's central dilemma - should Wakanda venture out into the world and lead by example? - but it's cleverly off-set by the depths of darkness and despair written into T'Challa's nemesis: Erik 'Killmonger' Stevens (Michael B. Jordan). Shaped by the very different circumstances of their lives, one man turns towards the light, and the other away from it - and yet, neither man falls simply into the black-and-white categories of 'hero' or 'villain'. Somehow, Coogler shades centuries of history and hope into the conflict at the heart of their troubled relationship.<br/><br/>Black Panther is no slouch, either, when it comes to turning up the heat in terms of action and spectacle. There's a jaw-dropping car chase through the neon-washed streets of Busan that's easily one of the most exhilarating scenes you'll see all year. Fight scenes are pulled off with remarkable flair, particularly when it comes to the swift military precision of the Dora Milaje - an incredibly cool, all-female special forces unit devoted to the protection of Wakanda's monarch. Wakanda itself is an eye-popping fantasy scape: a heady blend of futuristic elements and African traditons, colours and music. <br/><br/>Leading the film's top-notch ensemble, Boseman is the film's quiet backbone: an invaluable presence and the reason everything holds together at all. He shares an electric chemistry with Jordan, who blends swagger, menace and pathos in creating the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most complex, nuanced and sympathetic antagonist to date. <br/><br/>Fantastic as the two leading men, however, they're not the breakout stars of the film. That honour belongs to a trio of female characters - each one given depth, layers and a fierce, real on-screen presence that's still rare enough that they shouldn't be taken for granted. Lupita Nyong'o injects strength and steel into her portrayal of Nakia - a former and future love interest for T'Challa who manages to be interesting in her own right. The Walking Dead's Danai Gurira is a force to be reckoned with as Okoye, the righteous leader of the Dora Milaje; while Letitia Wright's Shuri - T'Challa's younger sister who also happens to be Wakanda's premier scientist - waltzes away with every scene in which she appears.<br/><br/>It may come as a surprise to some that Marvel's latest superhero blockbuster tackles issues of race, representation and discrimination in so bold and unflinching a manner. And yet, fans of the comic books that have inspired Marvel's entire slate of films would say: it's about time. In the way it embraces its story and heritage, in the way its heroes are presented, and in the way its message will inspire and empower generations to come, Black Panther matters. And it cannot - and will not - be ignored."

"emeraldorc","10","5","15","21 February 2018"," The Numbers Speak For Themselves
","I rarely give a movie 10/10. This is straight 10 for me, for a number of reasons. <br/><br/>1. There have been no movies that are cast with all African actors and directors, especially in the new marvel universe (I am excluding soul food movies here). There have also been hardly any blockbusters that have African leads, Denzel and Will Smith have tried with Hancock, American Gangster and I am Legend hence these two actors are legends. The acting from actors who don't get the practice of leading, is phenomenal, it was like watching 007, Matrix all in one. It was simply awesome that African actors could change perceptions without overdoing the us and them. <br/><br/>2. The story was authentically African, it embodies our view of the world, in some way often naive but good natutred that can be misconstrued as primitive or stupid. Most European directors often focus on the perceived negatives over these emotions. A mother makes naive choices, ends up a single mum, a son angry at an absent father but somehow lacks the capacity to forgive, the gangster who seems to have a childish view of living despite his obvious reality, the angry black man who takes a gun into a hospital to make his point of inequality. This movie was just the pure fun of living in an all African society. Where people fight, betray and make up without that anglo saxon need to finish what you started. One for the black folks to understand. <br/><br/>3. It highlights the gulf that has existed in the African population between, those who got sold into slavery and those who stayed and often this gulf has meant, affluent westernised Africans care little for those in Africa, hence the continent is poorer, it is a deep division caused by the most divisive point in history amazingly captured by Marvel of all people. The villain some how is not quite a villain a very DC touch in my opinion but very African in origin. <br/><br/>4. Every actor gave 100%, it was personal and in turn this singular film will inspire generations for millennia not because it features Africans but because it sends a positive message of hope to the whole world and embodies the African view of forgiveness, passion and self development, not many people could have emerged out of 400 years of systematic genocide to stand almost equal to any race today. Finally, it has a name ""Wakanda"". In my opinion, it is not a real place but lives in the heart of all Africans. <br/><br/>I can understand if the typical expectations were, another Marvel flick and it is now hard to turn tail but this is a seperate franchise, probably the last but an amazing movie, passionate, funny, suspenseful and worth a second watch. Go see it... Please! Critics are just not qualified to critique. It is a movie for Africans and those who want to have fun with a bold Marvel approach to adding Africans to the super hero universe. It was about time, considering we already kick ass in real life."
"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","9","5","15","18 February 2018"," Black Panther is the King of Marvel
","Ryan Coogler uses the template of Black Panther being this African superhero leading a secret futuristic nation to bring something new, fun and important to not just watch but also listen to. While it is not new that superhero movies like the X-men films, The Dark Knight and more recently with Winter Soldier and Civil War have used the genre to comment on politics, Coogler goes straight into the subject matter of an issue that is more relevant then ever. From the imaginary of Africans being forced onto slave ships in the opening cinematic, Coogler is not sugar-coating the fact that Black Panther is addressing the sour history of white colonialism to the struggle of black communities in third-world nations and America today.<br/><br/>On a visual and technical level it stands out from how many previous MCU films look and feel thanks to Coogler bringing his own cinematographer and composers he has collaborated with. Recently Oscar-nominated cinematography Rachel Morrison of Mudbound shoots very awe-moments that make Wakanda feel alive as a character. The music by Ludwig Gorisssons is also an improvement from the bland, predictable operatic score in past MCU films. The use of African chorus and instruments give Black Panther a lively feel with Gorissons using elements from Coogler's last movie Creed to give a sense of epic triumph. The action ranges from having the raw intensity in the Creed boxing matches to being kinetic and stylish, particular in the Korea scenes, like the Matrix. <br/><br/>With the Vibranium technology Coogler finds a visual aesthetic to show Wakanda not looking too fantastical nor alien but more advanced then Tony Stark's tech while still retaining its African roots. Through that he brings of a vision of afrofuturism (a term I recently learned before this movie came out) to life where we see a culture of Africa that thrives as an advanced utopia without the influence of western whitewashing. But because some of Wakanda's ideals and beliefs may be questionable, it introduces fully fleshed-out characters that each bring a layer to Wakanda's culture. With old-fashioned traditionalist like T'Challa, Okoye, Zuri and M'Baku we see where there dedication to an ancient tradition of isolation and monarchy comes from but there views are clashed with those who think Wakanda could improve itself and the rest of the world from the country's own millennial generation in Shuri, the spy who has seen the outside world's problems in Nakia to the destructive revolutionist in Erik Kilmonger. 
Chadwick Boseman brings back his calm, cool charisma from Civil War but with a emotional conflict brewing inside him of how to approach his reign as king when new information is revealed about his heritage. Rather then sidelined as supporting roles, we see actresses like Lupita N'yongo, Danai Guirra and breakout Leticia Wright become co-leads of there own. Wright as T'Challa's sister Shuri brings so much levity to what can be considered a serious political story but never feels like she is just a comic relief as she also acts as a younger but even smarter version of Tony Stark. And Danai Guirra also becomes a standout in showing some intense dramatic moments when her duty as the King's royal bodyguard is questioned. Winston Dukes as M'Baku, the tribal leader and rival of T'Challa is another surprise standout that shows a lot more depth and humour then I was expecting.<br/><br/>And at long last Marvel brings a villain that surpasses Loki on a psychologically layered and threatening level in Erik Kilmonger. Rather then just Kilmonger acting as plot device to force T'Challa on the hero's path like past MCU villains have done, he is presented with an arc that echoes the hero's own journey. The difference however is his own actions become very destructive that are fuelled by a personal tragedy. From the injustice people of African descent have suffered to Wakanda turning its back on those that need it like so many first-world nations have done, Kilmonger makes T'Challa truly ask as both a hero and king what kind of responsibility does someone with great power truly have. Michael B. Jordan's charming personality makes his villain very likeable but also channels a rebellious attitude and rage that puts past villains to shame. Andy Serkis also get some really fun and compelling moments as returning villain Klaw who is shown as an example of why Wakanda fear outsiders they call ""colonizers"".<br/><br/>The movie does have some problems though. While Martin Freeman gets more to do as Everett Ross then he did in Civil War, it does feel his role felt obligatory yet didn't feel like his character fit into the Wakanda storyline. The third act does fall into some of Marvel's usual final battle tropes with over-reliance on cg and the hero fighting an evil doppelgÃ¤nger. But once the typical big battle ends, you see the hero and villain have a compelling conversation with who each other about their quest to accomplish the same goal.<br/><br/>The best parts of this movie shine when Ryan Coogler as a director and co-writer takes control of the Marvel formula and uses it create an amazing and compelling standalone story that can leave with you with so much to talk about."
"hotrobinproductions","9","4","11","9 April 2019"," Best Marvel film to date (not just MCU but Marvel)
","I already know the hate this review will get. But it's true, this film transcends the marvel films into territory they haven't been able to even brush upon with their other films. From performances to script, to cinematography, this film has it all. I'm very concerned at the reviews on here where people are literally complaining about CGI. The landscape culture and the vibrant way it was shot was amazing. The CGI is solid, I don't get why people use it to bash films. If I were to watch a 1970s or older film I'm not going to bash it because the effects. I will judge the film off the film alone, how was the plot? How was the characters and acting? How was the cinematography? How was the script??? Like don't get me wrong. if it has impressive effects I will give them that and acknowledge it, especially for it's time, but I don't understand these people that complain about CGI and expect everything to be real. Let alone they expect every film to be some James Cameron focused CGI. Don't get me wrong, I love me some epic CGI especially when it pulls off so well, but I'm not going to judge the film so harshly on that alone and it's not fair that people do that. You should only do it if it's honestly distracting you from the plot or vibe in a moment of the film I guess, but even then I guess you can hate all the old films that came out back then because effects weren't the best JUST SAYING. Tired of these CGI fest people. ANYWAYS, this film delivers AND THEN SOME. It deserved to win best picture I have no idea why green room won over it but it did. This film achieved so much that it's a shame some audiences wouldn't know a good film if it was slapping them on the face. The performances from each character feels so rich and vibrant and everyone learns and changes to the end of the film. The VILLAIN is kick ass and by far the best villain in the MCU (over thanos as well) Michael B Jordan bounced back VERY hard after his failure in fan4stic. This film has the traditional superhero story but adds so much more with its own unique take. The director has such good talent using the amazing script. My only minor issue is the plot feels like 2 different films just minorly though. The Andy Serkis villain was great but his character kind of drifts away because something happens to him but then it shifts to a different film somewhat. It was a twist in a way but felt a bit fast and plot changing. Either way the characters still developed and didn't feel forced. The film is so beautifully shot from wakanda to the culture to the beautiful message of helping everyone around the world. The soundtrack is amazing and the music is SUCH heart wrenching and really captures you into the moment. There is some forced politics thrown in there here and there but it makes sense because it's an African country that has the utilities to help Africans when they were in slavery. Why wouldn't messages come up? I wouldn't say they were forced though it didn't feel forced for me. Captain Marvel forced their politics down our throats. From the feminist power, to ""illegal alien"" skrulls running from Donald trump... UGHH. But that's another story. I think black panther has it all AND more and for me personally it's definetly my top 10 favorite superhero movies of all time and definetly my #1 marvel film ever. Logan might be ahead MIGHT. But idk this film just has so much going for it.<br/><br/>Plot 10/10

Screenplay 10/10
Script 10/10
Soundtrack 10/10
Cast 10/10
Acting 10/10
Special Effects 10/10<br/><br/>Overall, Black Panther deserves the praise, the Oscars and It most certainly deserved to win best picture. Christopher Nolan, The Genius in filmmaking even acknowledged that it should have won. History is history. At least the academy acknowledged it. Either way this film was by far the best film of 2018 and it was nice to revisit the film once again to see if I wasn't crazy. When I'm sure I wasn't. It's a beautiful achievement in modern cinema. Not even superhero movies in general but in movies as a whole. It's definetly a film that stands out much more than meets the eye. I'm more of a DC guy but I can't deny marvel knows what they're doing. Good Job. Give the film a watch if you haven't. And if you have and don't agree then watch it again and take into consideration and try to focus on how it's such a huge achievement. And if you have seen it and agree with me, just watch it again because it deserves to be watched plenty of more times for it's beauty."

No brain, no reason, just obedience. And Hollywood is doing a better job than Stalin's party komissars.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the creepy old man, Stan Lee will probably come no more on screen, unless some of his fan base is going to digitally restore him."

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!! The beginning, middle and ending all tire together perfectly for a comprehensive story to feast on. Family secrets and revenge is the core of the story that makes a compelling story. The humor comes effortless that will make you laugh out loud and the action scenes are the icing on the cake.

","Black Panther was going to be a new and different entry into the Marvel film universe. A superhero and story we have not seen or heard before. The film definitely had its moments and plus points such as great CGI and effects. The fight scenes were a treat to watch and it had a great exotic feel to it. <br/><br/>However the story was very predictable and linear in that there were no surprises and nothing too original. The villain, despite a likeable actor, was a weak and uninspired one. The son of traitor who trained in the army and has returned to take the throne. There was a lack of humor and hence the drama felt forced and weak. The soundtrack was quite poor and there no strong supporting actors to help lift the film. <br/><br/>Overall a nice entry into the Marvel universe in the build up to the heavily anticipated Infinity war. <br/><br/>7/10"

"davidmvining","4","2","4","26 November 2019"," Frustrating
","Expository dialogue from beginning to end, coincidence to make James Fennimore Cooper blush, an incoherent structure, a laughably small timeframe for the story, really dodgy special effects, incoherent world building, and a pretty decent bad guy make for a bad film overall.<br/><br/>Ryan Coogler took the situation the Russos made in Civil War, T'challa being the Black Panther, and added so much unnecessary complexity to the situation. For some reason, he tied being the Black Panther to being King of Wakanda, even though it's obviously not necessary. Throwing in a requirement that T'challa lose his Panther powers for a fight to the death with anyone who wants to challenge him to take the throne made sense in the wake of that decision overall (because of how the second one plays out), but it creates massive structural and logic problems on top of it. Is this really how the country's next leader is decided? Whomever can kill the other in ritualized combat? And, there's a drug that can give you super powers and another that can immediately take them away? It's the kind of stupid you might expect from a comic book movie, but the powers are given and taken so easily and frequently within this individual film as to make the meaning of them smaller than intended.<br/><br/>So, T'Challa comes back from Europe after Civil War and has to become king and the Black Panther for real. He fights off a challenge from the fifth tribe in Wakanda who hasn't been seen in hundreds of years and secures his throne. Meanwhile, they've received notice of Klauwe, a South African arms dealer who stole a bunch of their precious metal vibranium from them decades ago and killed a bunch of people in the process, including the father of __, who leads one of the five tribes of Wakanda and leads the military. T'Challa goes to South Korea to intercept Klauwe, fails when the antagonist Killmonger gets him first and kills him in a way that leads to everyone else dying. Killmonger than takes Klauwe's body into Wakanda and immediately and coincidentally finds the one person in the whole country with both the inclination to listen to Killmonger at the sight of Klauwe's body and the authority to back him if he should decide to challenge T'Challa.<br/><br/>Killmonger challenges T'Challa to the throne, wins by throwing T'Challa over the waterfall without ensuring that the one guy who could prevent him from keeping the crown is actually dead, and starts an imperialistic program that will see Wakanda forcefully take over other countries because they don't align with his values. T'Challa is, of course, not dead, gets resuscitated and re-powered with the magic plant that gives him Black Panther powers before challenging Killmonger to a second fight which blows the whole country into its own civil war. Oh, and Killmonger had shown up less than twenty-four hours before.<br/><br/>This movie is a complete mess. The biggest issue is that the story itself really doesn't start until an hour in when Killmonger shows up in Wakanda. Everything up to that point are subplots that don't really matter. The first half hour deals with world building around a utopia with incomprehensible customs around government and an action scene that doesn't really matter because T'Challa was effectively king before and is king afterwards. Hell, based on Civil War, I assumed that T'Challa was already king because he said so in that movie. Klauwe is an excuse to get an action scene in Seoul. Since Killmonger just shows up with Klauwe's body, the whole action scene didn't actually affect the story in any meaningful way. Once Killmonger gets there, we get a sense of a central conflict, but the conflict of visions isn't built dramatically. It's just people explaining their believes to each other in expository dialogue. Killmonger, while a pretty good villain considering his competition of antagonists in the Marvel Universe, is more of a hodgepodge of motives that never really get straightened out. He's out for revenge and to make Wakanda an imperialistic power imposing its views on the world. Fine, but his motives for his actual actions seem more driven by the mere revenge and the stuff about imperialism is a coating on his motives. It doesn't feel like the motives were ironed out particularly well.<br/><br/>In the end, I find this a confusing slog of a film. The final fight gets ridiculous, not because it has war rhinos (which are kinda cool in a superficial way), but because of the short timeframe that the whole story has taken place. This great jewel of the world, hidden away because of its awesomeness, was thrown into complete chaos within a twenty-four hour period and only resolved because one guy got stabbed in the heart. I mean, there's disruptive and then there's a utopia that's never had its power structure challenged in the least way, undermining its status as a utopia. It also looks rather bland. There are bright colors in terms of costumes, but outside of that the movie leans much more heavily towards the visual aesthetic of Captain America than Guardians of the Galaxy or Thor: Ragnarok. Things look kind of blandly typical in Wakanda with science that has a visual texture that feels a whole lot like Tony Stark's tech that undermines the idea that Wakanda's science is all that advanced. It could have done better with a bigger embrace of the outlandish, though the waterfalls and costumes do provide some visual flair in an otherwise bland soup."

"AnthonyMeg","6","2","4","20 February 2019"," Imperfect adaptation for the Black Panther.
","This is your typical superhero movie or worse because It was a little frustrating. The cinematography and the sci-fi part were okay, but other than that it was hackneyed scripts unluckily, the film fell short of expectation. Perhaps because of the hype, there were few good acting performances especially in the combat scenes but generally the movie didn't pull me in I find Michael B. Jordan character more fascinating than Chadwick Boseman however still average. The characters are not developing, and that's a snag. The filmmakers didn't evenly focus on all characters. After the first thirty minutes, the movie jumped the shark for me, and I was so bored.
It's too stale for a high budget film like this it had box office success but that shouldn't matter when the movie is not extraordinary and lacks originality.
The African accent was apparently fake; I didn't like the way they forced it to their mouth. It baffles me that this film is nominated for the oscar. Out of generosity I gave this movie six stars."
"adamsmith-51004","7","2","4","8 December 2018"," Good just not great
","I enjoyed it more second-time round but it is overhyped. It is a good MCU film but nowhere near the best. There are two main problems with it:<br/><br/>1. Although the villain is strong and has a good motive for his actions, this film falls into the classic Marvel plot of 'villain is in a similar suit to the hero; villain's suit looks more advanced; hero is knocked down; then eventually wins' - it's a bit old and generally Marvel are thankfully moving away from this rather dull story device but it's well and truly alive in this film.<br/><br/>2. The women absoltuely steal the show! This is almost a good thing - how wonderful to see both black people and women portrayed as strong and smart and I don't think there was even an inkling of women just being there to be pretty or love interests. This is one of the best films I've ever seen with regards to female equality and portrayal. However, the movie's titular (male) character is almost irrelevant. Not to slate Chadwick Boseman's performance, he did a fine job, but the story would not really miss him. The women seem far stronger and more capable and don't particularly need him for anything. He has his own story but this film is about Shuri and Okoye and either one would probably make a better and more interesting hero.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is worth seeing just don't believe the hype. It's a bit more Bond than MCU for the most part which is an interesting take so if you're looking for a mystical 007 adventure in Africa, Korea and London then you'll enjoy it."

","Yes, the CGI in this movie is pure excellence. That's all I can say on the positive side after yawning through this dreadful Marvel story. I love superhero films but this one made little sense. Firstly, how can such an advanced civilisation remain hidden in Africa for so many centuries? It would have been more believable were it set deep within the Amazon for example.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed to see Forest Whitaker's type cast performance as he might as well have been playing in The Last King of Scotland. The main actor was, in my opinion, badly chosen. I think Michael Jai White would have pulled it off better. The strongest performance from was by Michael B Jordan ( Creed main actor ). <br/><br/>I know superhero stories are meant to be fantastical but this one just didn't make any sense to me.

","I was slightly let down by thia movie, my expectations weren't very high but I still expected more than this. I'm gonna start off on a high note with the positives. First of all this movie is largely very well paced, you can easily define each act of the movie which aided in storytelling. The characters were all quite enjoyable and fit there roles especially the titular character, Chadwick Boseman felt so natural and comefortable in T'Challa. Fun additions to the cast were Andy Serkis and Letita Wright. The film was shot very well, I enjoyed the cinematography and it featured more vibrant colours than I would've expected. Unfortunately where this movie loses it's steam is in the script, it consistentaly put the characters into positions which lead to a predictable story, there were so many things that I knew were gonna happen before they did, not too many twists and turns to keep things interesting. Another thing that bothered me was the unrealistic technology, it consumed most of the action sequences with, ""hey look at this cool thing"", tech played an important part in the script but the unbelievability of it just took me right out of the story. The dialogue was also very campy from time to time and not in a self aware kind of way. The character motivations don't always make sense, I felt the conflict wasn't properly resolved by the end. And the action scenes took a dive into ""lazy cgi punchfests"" so to speak, I thought we were over that, especially after the scathing reviews this film recieved. I'm honestly shook this film has such a high metascore, I really don't believe it's that good. The positives are there I just think it suffers from a fair bit."
"gabedc-50804","6","2","4","30 September 2018"," Entertaining But Very Flawed
","Black Panther presents wonderful world building and perfectly played characters and has a cultural significance that's impossible to ignore. However, the plot is wracked by common Marvel-brand movie problems and for some reason the CGI is incredibly lacking. The love interest plot could be removed to no detriment of the movie and tension is sorely lacking. There is no concern or worry regarding the characters throughout the whole story and the resolution feels basic. The characters push it along well, however, and still make eh viewing very enjoyable.<br/><br/>The reason for a 6/10 is that I believe 5 is average, and everything above that should be earned. Black Panther's issues are the type it never had to have and were so obvious that minor adjustment could have fixed them. It seems as if the movie was rushed and a bit of the humour is painfully dated. I would still recommend this movie, particularly if you enjoy the MCU."

It is the first superhero blockbuster where all the protagonists are not just black, but they also speak in African accent and reside in a secret location somewhere in Africa where technology is highly advanced far beyond the rest of humanity. Never before have I seen Africa in such a way, I tend to associate the sub-Saharan part of the continent with being the most undeveloped and trouble-ridden part of the world so the mere idea gave me a bit of a cultural shock, my mind was somewhat blown and I felt those dark corners of my mind where these ideas reside enlightened by new possibilities. Unfortunately this is where the originality begins and ends. The movie is a boring cliche superhero tale, and I understand it was over-hyped for pushing its politically correct agenda.

I am a white human being, and this movie forced several comments and actions throughout the movie that portrayed whites negatively. No I am not talking about the culture of the wokandans, I found the portrayal of their people interesting. And yes, I understand slavery is a horrible stain in history, but I do not see the relevance of slavery to any character in this movie. Yet, it is forcefully brought up.<br/><br/>For example, as kilmonger was dying he said something along the lines of, ""my ancestors jumped off of ships, because they knew that death was better than bondage.""<br/><br/>This quote and his actions of trying to give weapons to all black people illustrate kilmonger's purpose to help blacks against whites.<br/><br/>None of this seems to make any sense to me... never in the movie does kilmonger ever encounter any racism by any whites. In fact the only thing we seem him face is his father's death... by another black man. Also, the quote about slaves jumping off of ships instead of bondage doesn't apply to him either. In the movie, we never see kilmonger's mother, who would be the only one that had ancestors that came on ships. His father was blessed with the prosperity of the wokandans his entire life. So, this quote really has no part in this movie.<br/><br/>If you were to argue that the quote does fit, and that his mother was effected by slavery. If you are black and you like this movie because you relate to the struggles of racism and blame white people because of slavery and the poverty of black people... let me ask you this. <br/><br/>Who sold black people into slavery?
Black people"

This film is no different to the rest. It is neither overly bad or good.<br/><br/>@ People crying about it being over hyped etc. EVERY movie is over hyped. If you havn't learned that by now then you have some serious misgivings.<br/><br/>Black panther turned out to be exactly what i thought it would be. Nothing more, nothing less. It has plenty of decent action, a couple of scenes in which you think to yourself ""really?""<br/><br/>But all in all rating it 1 star says more about you than this film. Can people PLEASE start making their reviews AFTER thinking first. Don't let the over hype anger you and then rate it 1 star. It is both unfair and and unintelligent way to review.<br/><br/>All you see these days in IMDB is 10/10 and 1/10 with very few others in between, unless the movie has an adult audience.

","I looked up Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, IMDb ratings, and they indicate good signs for this movie. However, this came out to be extremely terrible, confusing, poorly developed and full of plot holes.<br/><br/>First, they introduce us into a new world, new culture, technically an unknown universe to begin with. But then it quickly moves to actions and stuffs that made me feel completely lost in this Wakanda. Overhyped, I think. They brought all these festivities and vibes all over and forgot that we haven't been around to get any of it. The characters and drives into movies were also unfully developed. Also, one of the male lead's arrival was only discovered after halfway through the movie, that made it unfocused.<br/><br/>Unlike any other Marvel, I didn't like the actions at all. They seem so fake, unrealistic and old -- like a false mixtape of a bunch of details from different movies. I was expecting great cultural and action experience, not this crampy hot mess. Is it just me feeling that the only reason critics gave high ratings on this one is that they would be called racist for not doing so? I do not get it."

Black Panther hit a perfect balance between plot substance and action - perhaps people are upset because there isn't an overwhrlming presence of action?

Who let Andy Serkis was off the lead and told him to perform like a panto villain who thought he was playing a pirate. The only credit must go to Michael B. Jordan who turned in another good performance, and Letitia Wright as Panthers sister Shuri.<br/><br/>After the movie my sister and I had a chat about what we'd just seen, and apart from the general disappointment, the over-riding feeling we were left with was... If the casts colour had been reversed, the film would be branded as racist.<br/><br/>Bottom line: although I understand for an American movie this was a major thing cast wise, the casts acting was generally poor. As a Marvel film this was uneven and disappointing. And when the credits had rolled we were left with a bad taste in our mouths saying almost in unison that we won't be watching that again."

The idea that I'm meant to fawn over this film because it has black people in it is insulting, and it almost makes me want to hate the film, but I respect Marvel too much to let my perception of this film be swayed by ridiculous, leftist fans.

","I personally think that different people expected and wanted too many things from this movie that were way to deep and unfortunely they were disappointed and maybe that's why they hated it. I admit they were some flaws and it was rather fast paced for me but I feel that these days everyone is expecting perfection since everything is just constantly changing. The hype made it worse( it felt incredibly weird watching a superhero sci fi movie with the majority of black people instead of you being the only black weirdo) but its fine. The director and actors did there best even though there actors amused me when they struggled with there Xhosa but its fine I could still hear them. Focusing too much on whether the movie showed enough black power and political issues is a emotional strain and turn off . the reality of this world is already bad enough so ruining people's only escape from it is just horrible. But anyway I liked the movie despite everything I understood every character there twists and turns there slightly out of character storyline, and yes I even went and researched there comic book lives and I have to say if Storm shows up in the sequel I hope Nakia kills her cause there a big gaps from the comic and the movie producers !

","Good things first:
The actors are beautiful and talented. The cast give fantastic performances with the exception of the guy who plays the main baddy who does a so-so job.<br/><br/>The CGI is obnoxiously overused, but it looks pretty cool. Similarly the design of the aircraft and the underground part of the city looked super cool.<br/><br/>The bad:
Very little in this movie makes sense. The plot is stupid and so many important details were overlooked. For example, why do the super-advanced people fight exclusively with melee weapons? Also, why do they have super advanced weapons and fighter/bomber planes and why do the average citizenry seem to know military tactics (they form a phalanx during the final fight) if they've never been in a single war ever and have only ever hidden from the world???? <br/><br/>Why does Black Panther simply have a special suit and magic metal claws? This is supposed to be part of the Marvel universe so Ironman and the Hulk exist in this. What could this guy contribute? He could contribute super advanced and nearly indestructible weaponry (guns/drones/satellites) based on the magic metal. Instead, he's just a tribal cliche in a catsuit... meow.<br/><br/>Moreover, there were some REALLY good concepts that were brought up, but never fully examined. For example there were ideas of family, heritage, identity, geopolitics, race and more that were never really examined. Even the main baddy's motivation could have made for a really great story with a REALLY dark twist at the end, but, instead we got the Disney rated G ending which didn't even make any sense."

But really? Just this was enough to get you 1B+ in box office? Wonder woman was 10x better as a movie. Maybe they were right in 2016. America IS more sexist than racist.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie itself was very bland. The plot made zero sense. I know the Avengers universe was supposed to be very fiction, but still, this was stretching it. A small country in the middle of Africa being sooooo advanced? And if it's so advanced, why do people still wear those half naked clothes and fight so primitively? Why is their election still so savage? Whoever wins a fist fight... Geez. And why would a kid raised in America for his entire life, who went to MIT and everything, have no ambition other than to go back to this African country and be some stupid king? And really? You grew up in Oakland. I thought this would be one of the less oppressed places for POC. He recites the history textbooks like he lived 300 years to see all the slavery. I mean at least write some plot that makes sense.<br/><br/>The characters were very one dimensional as well. Black Panther himself was super boring. Nobody had any personality. Killmonger was a complete douche. I mean I thought in recent years Marvel made sure to write characters with life stories and end games that made sense. Killmonger was like one of those 60's Disney villains that just wanted to burn the world.

"boe_dye","7","2","4","28 February 2018"," CGI Rhino's and Moar
","In typical Marvel fashion, this latest movie adaptation of a comic book was as solid as the rest. The casting was good, the acting was good, the story was good, generally speaking this movie was for all intents and purposes, good. Shuri was certainly the most fun character, T'Challa inspires honor, dignity and humility with an ""always do right"" attitude, M'Baku was just cool, Romanda was stately as a true Queen ought be, and Kill-Monger was a tragic, but despicable villain who carried with him years of misplaced rage -- they were all well portrayed, and quite believable.<br/><br/>And therein lies the problem: It doesn't stand out in any real way, nor does it inspire repeat watchings, or even the need for a sequel. It simply melts into the Marvel Cinematic Universe without making any real or significant impact. It was a fun movie, but despite the hype surrounding it, and despite the overblown political nature, it was, in a very strange way, bland.<br/><br/>That arguably is the biggest problem that the Haus of Maus faces with all of it's major blockbusters now: They have gotten so good at the formula, that they aren't daring, nor are they even trying anymore. They cookie cutter the formula over and over again, change a few things here and there, and call it a new movie. We are essentially living in an age of Pop-Movies, where there is little difference between A and B, other than the physical appearance, and maybe a little bit of dialogue here and there.<br/><br/>After a while though, I started to feel a bit bothered in that a great deal of this movie felt trope-y, in that it had an idea of Africa, without really actually being African. Kind of like how many of us imagined China-Town was after watching Big Trouble in Little China, this started to feel like it was more of an Idea of what Africa was all about, rather than what Africa is all about. Naturally of course that makes sense as Wakanda is an idealized destination, however parts of it felt more like a Disney ride, exploiting the imagery associated with what folks might typically associate with Africa.<br/><br/>Again, it wasn't bad, but it didn't really leave me with much other than being offended at the constant white jokes and jabs, and the turning the children in the end into little more than a stereotype where they said ""we can take this apart and sell the pieces"", referring to T'Challa's hover-ship that landed in the middle of an Oakland California Basketball Court.<br/><br/>However, I do understand why they made this movie, and the meta-narrative behind it is... a curious thing, if you understand the story."

But at times I missed Tony Stark, I mean he would kill to have access to Wakanda's technology, and what about Captain America pledging for Buckys fate?<br/><br/>The worst thing IMO is that this one doesn't fit at all with other Marvel movies. It may be an average solo film, but nothing else, very much like Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>Even with all the action, there's really no sense of danger, its supposedly going worldwide but the threat never leaves wakanda. Its like no one ever knew they were in danger.
Ragnarok went over the top on comedy, but here, its non existant, I think I only giggled with Stan Lee's cameo.

","Pros: The character of Tchalla is one of the best that I have had the pleasure of watching in the MCU. Along with the supporting cast, the actors performances throughout the whole film are very good and a lot of credit should go to the way in which they portray the hero's and villains in the movie, especially by the females in the film.
As much as I feel the second half of the film lacks a large amount content, the first half is superb. Brilliant set pieces, funny dialogue, even though one particular joke feels as though it is straight out of 2015, and a large amount of intrigue. 
I mention the action scenes, they are superb a lot of action and a lot of emotion behind them
Some of the music is fantastic to listen to, some of traditional African music played throughout the whole film fits really well with the premise and setting of the movie. <br/><br/>Cons: The green screen creates some of the WORST backdrops I have ever seen in the film. Completely taking you out of what should be some very intense scenes.
I never feel as though there is a lot riding on the story. It is very simplistic and it appeared to me as though if Tchalla was not to overcome the conflict in the film, very little would happen. The world created would not be in a worse place than before, and that is a problem.
As much as I liked the traditional music, the forced trap beats and songs that are jammed into it feel as though it is simply their to relateable to it's teenage audience. Although in some cases it works, they are few and far between, with it often not fitting well within what is being portrayed on screen. More of the traditional music would have been a welcome change and some more suspenseful scores for the car chase scene would have worked a lot better. However, I would say go and listen to the album, that is very enjoyable.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I came out of the theatre dissapointed with the movie. And even though I believe it is over-rated I now, after looking back on it, feel as though it is a very good film that is well worth watching. Despite the issues that people appear to be looking over it is a very enjoyable film. Don't go in with the high expectations that people are putting out online as there are some problems with the film. All in all a very good, but flawed movie. 7/10"

Yet many of their people still live in mud huts or in the mountains living in caves! Its a small nation with spaceships that can fire lasers yet cannot hit a stationary target from 100m away. That in a fight scene in the middle of an open field, an army suddenly appears from behind a rock (I kid you not) to save the day.<br/><br/>Had it been done tongue in cheek rather than trying to make the whole plot believable it could have been watchable.

","First of all I have to question the worthiness of this film being Oscar nominated for best picture. It is a Marvel film. They are designed and adored for their entertainment value, which is fantastic - their critical acclaim less so. I think the only reason Black Panther reached these wavering heights during awards season was because of its attempts to scratch the surface on some social and racial themes, but the message is weak and never really makes any sort of impact. Other than that slight criticism however I rate this as a really enjoyable watch and another great addition to the MCU.<br/><br/>As a Walking Dead fan I loved Danai Gurira's role in this film, playing the part of the strong female warrior as brilliantly as always. Daniel Kaluuya was wasted somewhat, he's excellent in Get Out and deserved a bigger role here, and there's something a bit shallow about Martin Freeman's CIA man Everett Ross, who I'm not particularly excited to see more of in Marvel films to come. The standout performance comes from Andy Serkis, who we rarely see on screen without the guise of motion capture animation - after watching him portray Ulysses Klaue in Black Panther you'll be asking yourself the same question I did... why not?! He is fantastic as Klaue. It's a shame the writers cut his screen time short and opted to lead the plot down the Lion King path, as I believe he could've made for a better primary antagonist.<br/><br/>An honourable mention must be made to the soundtrack, which rivals that of Guardians of the Galaxy for the MCU's no.1 spot (and that's no mean feat).

","As the title suggest, it was a good film but does not satisfy the hype. It won 3 Oscars from 7 nominations.
1. Original score 2. Costume design 3. Production design.
Original score means the background music of the film. Few scenes had tremendous background score but wasn't consistent, so there's no point in it. Well ok costumes were good. The lastly, production design which means the sets and overall look of the film. The sets were amazing and really creative but I guess infinity war got better production design.
Now the action, well it was mediocre nothing groundbreaking and the screenplay which is the plot, well also mediocre. The film won BAFTA award for best visual effect, infinity war had great VFX but it wasn't even nominated, so again mediocre. A mediocre film winning 3 Oscars. Well I don't know what critics found in it but for me it was an average film. But it really gives a good experience in theatre"

","The character of Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) was first introduced in Captain America: Civil War. In it T'Challa was the prince of Wakanda, a mysterious African nation whose technological supremacy has been carefully hidden for centuries. Unfortunately the events of Civil War rob T'Challa of his father and now he's to be crowned king. But there are those that dispute his worthiness.<br/><br/>We'll talk about the story in a bit, but if there's one thing Black Panther absolutely nails it's production design. How the film looks, how the costumes are made, what kind of backgrounds are used. That stuff. Because by the heavens if this film isn't one of the most gorgeous pieces of cinema I've ever seen. And from what I've read, they went to great lengths to represent different regions of Africa, giving them voice and visibility. Which has been well-received, I'm glad to hear.<br/><br/>Although, speaking of how the film looks, there is one aspect that could have been better. And that's the CGI elements. Those often look rather rubbery and fake, unfortunately, which is a shame because Marvel usually has had really good CGI.<br/><br/>I also really like all the main characters. From Boseman's T'Challa to Letitia Wright's Shuri to Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger to so many others. All great characters with interesting motivations and clearly established personalities. Killmonger especially is one of the all-time great Marvel villains. His struggle against Wakanda is born from something personal and identifiable rather than just from a lust to conquer and destroy. You don't agree with him, but you can see where he's coming from.<br/><br/>That being said, I found the story itself to be formulaic. It telegraphs rather egregiously where it's going at any given moment and that lessens the tension. Sure, you have fun along the way, but you still watch the film and wish it could have had the courage to do something different. For example, the battle scene near the middle of the film. Could have gone differently, which would have allowed some other characters to step in and make bad choices anyway. Which would have been more dramatic. But no, the winner wins, because of course he does. That's how these stories go.<br/><br/>Still, Black Panther is a good movie. A veritable feast for the eyes, with great characters and a story which while by the numbers still delivers what you expect from it."

By the time this rolled out of the monstrosity that has become Disney, it turned into a racist mashup of political correctness that relied too heavily on fake ""african"" accents, fake ""Afrikaans"" accents and thug life posing by Killmonger.

This movie shows him as being weak and unworthy of wearing the Claw Necklace.<br/><br/>Hopefully, the film will go the way of the LAST Fantastic 4: forgotten and stillborn.<br/><br/>One positive note, the special effects were on the money.

","So considering that this film had such great ratings I thought it was about time to talk about this film. Please note that the 7/10 is subject to change. I decided that this movie deserved an 7/10 because of how it has many real world conflict affiliations. It gave motivation to every charcter and allowed you to not be wary of rooting for the bad guys sometimes because of how down to earth their motivations are. However there are many problems that for some could bring this movies rating down to a 6 or even 5 out of 10. These include a lack of suspense. There is a point in the movie where you really will feel that there is zero risk for the good guys to lose. Despite the noir being pretty well paced and the action being very well done, problems like the lack of suspense really bring the movie down. I suppose the movies main redeeming quality is just how fun and action packed it is. It's just a really good time.<br/><br/>Hope you enjoyed my review and have a great time"

But for me nothing here felt special in any way which I had hoped for going into this. Even worse so, most of the typical Marvel-characteristics didn't work as well as in some of their previous entries, making them actually pretty decent: music, humour, CGI. 
As for the music, the original score is fine but the incorporation of the Kendrick Lamar curated soundtrack didn't work at all for me. Most of the tracks were pretty awful so they should have been left out of the movie. Martin Freeman and Letitia Wright were the only ones with comedic timing. And the CGI was laughably bad at times, especially towards the end. Wondering why Marvel didn't put as much effort as usual into this.

Love interest that does little to nothing. Villain that has a motivation that seems to change throughout the film. Any other character discussion would result in spoilers. There's a lot of cringe worthy lines. Bad jokes are littered throughout this film. And a lot of stuff that made me unintentionally laugh.<br/><br/>The visual effects are quite bad.

","The usual introduction and disclaimer applies. When I chose to go to a comics-inspired movie I expect a different type of experience than the one that I expect when I go do a Shakespeare-inspired film or an European art production. Yet, there are good films and bad films and I have seen all of them in all genres. Within the limits of its genre I did not find 'Black Panther' directed by Ryan Coogler to be a very good film and it's difficult to me to understand the enthusiastic reception given to it by some of the film critics that I otherwise agree with most of the time. It's not a bad film either. It's just average.<br/><br/>The idea could actually work as most of the ideas of comics-based characters. A meteorite hit Earth million of years ago bringing with it a precious metal, vibranium, stronger than anything we know plus some curative properties. Vibranium is something like the reverse of kryptonite which was annihilating the powers of Superman, with the difference that while the Black Panther superhero can use it and become superhero by drinking it in liquor form, his whole nation of Wakanda can enjoy its power and build an advanced underground civilization in a secluded area of Africa, with one of the poorest countries on Earth as a cover above the ground. If you did not hear about Wakanda you should not worry, you probably did not hear about many of the - say - 20 poorest nations on Earth members of the UN. The adventures of young king T'Challa who ascended to the throne and is confronted with many internal and external threats and enemies as well as with the dilemma whether to continue the isolationist policies of his father and ancestors ('Wakanda first' :-) ) or open and share his technology with the rest of the planet and especially with the oppressed categories on it are the essence of the story. The rest is CGI and 3D effects.<br/><br/>It is visible that film director Ryan Coogler made a serious effort to add a layer of serious items to the basic comics story. Allusions to current events in the US and rest of the world like racial inequities, war as a mean of settling conflicts and isolationism are more than transparent. The treatment they get in the film is pretty conventional and there are no surprises or dilemmas, there are more questions than answers. Characters are quite well differentiated but their depth does not exceed the two dimensions of the comics heroes - we pretty much know from start what they will be doing and how they will react to various challenges. Good acting by a few well known and other lesser known actors could not add too much, not even the fantastic Forest Whitaker or Angela Bassett. Computer graphics are spectacular but they lack innovation, I found them to be at the middle of the road between 'Star Wars' and 'The Jungle Book' (the animated version). One atop the other, it's reasonable entertainment for kids of all ages (and I include myself in this category) but it's not up to the buzz."

"drknezz","5","0","0","13 April 2018"," Really? how did critics give this such a high score?
","I don't know where to begin. As a brainless action movie, its okay. Otherwise, its just a bad movie. <br/><br/>Imagine this : 
Child of traitor was brought to wakanda, to be raised together with spoiled prince. Child of traitor was bullied, and in one turn of events, ended up running away or kicked out of palace by the spoiled prince, to live in hardships in one of the african nation, learning to hunt and fight with the natives of the tribe. 
Now grown up, this child of traitor comes back to wakanda to find the spoiled prince is now a dictator with black panther superpowers. 
Rallying popular support of the opressed folk, child of traitor fought against this dictator, regains peace in wakanda, and becomes the black panther. <br/><br/>Was that the movie we watched? No. but that would have been an amazing movie with character progression, and an actual reason, a hero we can sympathize with. But what did we get instead: <br/><br/>Premise : Confused, does not make sense.
1. We've got a utopia nation that has an action hero equipped with james bond gadget as a king. Seriously, whats going on here? The last black panther was the old king, he was ...what, 70 or 80 when he died? 
The last time he ran around with his black panther costume was probably 30 years ago. What is black panther for in this utopia nation? They made it clear time and again that the nation does not deal with the rest of the world. So .... is the black panther king's role in the last century to catch petty thieves in the capital of wakanda? 
Why is there a fully equipped state of the art james bond type lab dedicated to black panther, if black panther is inherently not needed in his own country, AND, if black panther was this old 70 year old king who hasn't worn the costume for decades?
2. We've got confused evil dudes. They sound like good guys, they want to help the rest of the black world, and not just keep Wakanda's prosperity to themselves. WHOA. they sound like heroes. And to do this...they are going to sell to arms dealers, rob banks, give weapons to gangs in New York?? No seriously. They could be smuggling blue prints of technology or medicines. Or something else, for the greater good of their people outside wakanda. Or education. Anything. And did i hear new york? What is this, 1800, age of slavery? What black person is not a free person in new york today? No, this is simply a blacks vs whites movie. With one token white dude. And the misguided bad guys idea of spreading the prosperity of wakanda to others seems to be to start a neighbourhood war by giving weapons to gangs. Yeah, thats a believable premise. Why not steal wakanda's technologies and give them to african nations? <br/><br/>Action quality : Poor
I watched the 3D version of this. Maybe its the 3D glasses, but I never had this problem before: The movie action scenes are too dark. Imagine this : The opening action scene is a man dressed in all black kicking ass of people in the dead of the night. No, seriously, what really happened in the final fight? I can't see whats going on. 2 guys in all black fighting in the middle of poorly lit cavern. They had to keep opening up their masks in the middle of a fight to reveal who is who. Its all a blur of black shadows. Imagine if Spiderman or batman or captain america has to take off their masks in the middle of a fight every now and then to talk. Thats just ridiculous. They could have done the fight in a brighter cavern. or any number of things. <br/><br/>Character Progression : NONE.
The bad guys born to be bad, the hero was born to be a hero. None of that struggle Tony stark had to deal with to be a hero. Or Christian Bale in batman begins. Nothing. Black panther is an inherited role, and even when he predictably lost his power as heroes do in movies, he did not have to do anything to regain it. He simply woke up and drunk a potion. No, really?
Seriously, the bad guy had more potential for an interesting character. To bad, he was not either. <br/><br/>Seriously, the only significant thing this movie has is its casting. Finally, a blockbuster not only dominated by white cast. Except, do we really need one to completely be dominated by black cast? Can't there be a balance where diversity triumph? Is it always a competition?"

","The highly anticipated superhero film ""Black Panther"" is finally here, after a ton of hype and outstanding reviews. While I would say that the film very, very slightly does not quite live up to some of the hype, it is still well-made and thoroughly entertaining. The film's acting is stronger than one would come across in most superhero movies, highlighted by Chadwick Boseman's commanding and stylish performance as T'Challa (Black Panther.) Also noteworthy is Michael B. Jordan's role as the impressively complex villain, and the Dora Milaje--the all-female special forces unit of Wakanda (the fictional African country where much of the film takes place.)<br/><br/>Speaking of Wakanda, director Ryan Coogler has masterfully designed and executed difficult world-building tactics to create this kingdom. The visual effects on display depicting Wakanda's unique landscapes are stunning, and it is genuinely impressive the detail that went into analyzing the kingdom's mercantile economy and political structure. Through depiction of a spear-fighting ritual as well as music, dance and food, audiences are immersed into the nation's local culture as well. These elements often make ""Black Panther"" feel more fresh than the typical superhero film.<br/><br/>While there's undoubtedly much to like about ""Black Panther,"" the film does unfortunately contain some notable lapses. Its biggest flaw is that the climax of the movie is incredibly rushed and sometimes feels like it has trouble taking its time to tie up loose ends and plot holes. Conversely, the first act seems a bit too long. While the movie is generally well-written, the film's attempted moments of comic relief and one-liners that are effective in other Marvel movies tend to fall a bit flat here. That said, this is still a good and unique superhero film that I do recommend. 7/10<br/><br/>Note: I saw the film in IMAX. The film's frequent use (over an hour of footage worth) of special formatting for IMAX, as well as the screen size and sound system, made this premium experience worthwhile."

If you are a person who appreciates the beauty of the birthplace of man, of African culture and life itself, you will be on cloud nine at the end.

","Ryan Coogler, relative new comer, and director of 2015's Creed, does an incredible job of realising this complex character first introduced in the third Captain America movie, Civil War, Black Panther was an integral part of the storyline and captured audience's attention with a flair for spectacular action stunts. <br/><br/>Black panther stands triumphantly as it's own story, understood to be taking place in the grander scheme, but telling a story firmly rooted in it's own world, and not leaning too hard into being an infinity War lead-up. Compared to plethora of MCU films, and even to the current deluge of films in the super-hero genre, with releases this year from Fox, Sony, and others, Black Panther is a fun solid start to 2018's year of the superhero.<br/><br/>The film has spectacular action sequences, a beautifully moving and creative score, design work evoking African culture while melding with fictional advanced technology. However, the film is not without its faults. The plot is predictable when it's not all over the place. The script fails to endear us to characters in the way the score is begging us to feel. Many characters' motivations are constantly undefined. And the 3D conversion is nauseating (and that's coming from someone who ALWAYS chooses the watch a movie in 3D if available).<br/><br/>There is a moment in the Avengers where Thor says of Thanos' intentions that his interest in Earth stems from the fact that Earth has demonstrated they are ready for a higher form of war, and Black Panther asks the audience to accept a higher form of superhero film, and while I applauded it for its attempt, and for the moments where it succeeds, that just makes the moments where it falters all the more disappointing and unforgivable.<br/><br/>You can't ask an audience to come along on a more intellectual movie and then hand them a B grade superhero flick. I don't fault critics for being so overwhelmingly positive about this movie, it's a good movie with a positive message, and I'm rating it positively too, it's just not the movie we needed, it's not the Messiah that it's being hailed as.<br/><br/>Wonder woman needed to be good so that we can get other female led superhero films. Black panther needed to be good because we need better minority representation in films, in genre films specifically. Not just in characters, but in story. And in that regard, it will undoubtedly succeed in making sure studio executives believe investing in movies like Black Panther is a good idea and will bring audiences to the theatres in droves. In that way the movie has most definitely succeed."

"vamsisadapa-29919","10","5","16","18 February 2018"," Beautiful but just not a marvel movie (I ain't complaining)
","Its completely different from any marvel movie till date.This just wasn't what people were expecting I guess. But its a really good movie makes you think about a lot of problems in today's world. the soundtrack is a blast, The whole cast did a great job though I wished Jordan got a bit more screen time. The ending just blew me away. So simple yet so satisfying. The movies greatness lies in the fact that it challenges you to think and choose who to support the hero or the villain, both whose causes are justified, and . You kind of end up feeling sad for the bad guy, just fighting for what he thinks is right. No other marvel movie delivers this sort of experience.<br/><br/>Sure its not as action packed or funny as other marvel movies but it doesn't rely on these elements, instead it drags you into the story and makes you feel the pain and conflict inside each character, expressed so elegantly you can almost feel them come to life.<br/><br/>Many people probably went to the theaters expecting a high action flick with a guy running in a bullet proof cat suit and some comedy thrown in to the mix. This could've been like that but no, they decided to make something different , a different class of movie, more focused on internal struggles than fist fights, that is the strongest point of the movie. If you don't like it I understand, it just wasn't a general superhero movie. Maybe try watching the movie again without thinking of it as a superhero film, but just a normal movie with a social message, you might like it."
"micahbundy","8","9","35","17 February 2018"," A Marvel Experience Like No Other
","Black Panther is the eighteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is directed by Ryan Coogler. The film follows T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), shortly after the events of Civil War. He takes his rightful place as king of Wakanda, a technologically advanced city that is hidden in Africa. He quickly faces challenges though, as Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), comes for the throne.<br/><br/>The best aspect of the film is Wakanda. Director Ryan Coogler creates an authentic setting that is full of vibrant colors, beautiful scenery, fascinating culture, and advancements in technology. There are some beautiful shots in the film that are complimented by the excellent color choice. The culture is truly fascinating from its great costumes to its interesting traditions. There is also a nice contrast within the culture, of old and new. While Wakanda is constantly innovating, it stays grounded in it's old and unique traditions. Wakanda's advancements in technology are fun to watch, whether it's in action sequences or the daily lifestyles of a Wakandan. This is world-building at its finest. Coogler gives us an authentic world that feels lived in, compared to other settings in the MCU like Asgard from the Thor franchise.<br/><br/>The action sequences can be best described as fluent. These sequences are fast-paced and well choreographed. The Wakandan technology makes these sequences exciting. These are simply some of the most entertaining sequences ever seen in the MCU.<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman gives you that slick and intelligent character that is expanded upon in the film.The chemistry is great, especially in the four main protagonists. T'Challa and each member of his crew have believable relationships and each character serve their own purpose within his crew. Letitia Wright's Shuri and T'Challa have a dynamic relationship, where they actually feel like siblings. She also accounts for most of the comic relief in the film. Danai Gurira's Okoye is an all business character that is loyal to her king. Lupita Nyong'o plays Nakia. While she is mostly there as T'Challa's love interest, she has her own set of goals that adds another layer to her character, as well as T'Challas.<br/><br/>The character that really steals the show is Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger. His character has powerful and clear motivations, that some might even find relatable. This makes his character conflicting for the viewer as they choose between him and T'Challa. While most villains in the MCU suffer from being poorly written, Killmonger has some great scenes that build up his character and give his character a legitimate purpose that most MCU villains lack. Killmonger even causes T'Challa to question himself, which is the mark of a great villain. Yet he still felt like he didn't get enough screen time and some of the scenes in this film could have easily been replaced with scenes that give more insight into his character.<br/><br/>The film had few negatives, but they're worth talking about. This film lacks emotional moments. Without the emotional moments, this film lends itself as a very predictable one. The film does have social commentary and some political agendas. The political agendas take the form of two lines though. The lines still feel like they were throw in there and just felt unnecessary in a Marvel film.<br/><br/>Overall, Black Panther is unlike any Marvel experience I have ever had. This film definitely feels like a Marvel film, but it separates itself from its predecessors. Coogler creates an authentic setting that has a lot going for it. The film boasts great effects, action sequences, and cinematography. The film has excellent main and supporting characters. Killmonger is one of the best Marvel villains to date but still didn't get enough screen time. The film is predictable and has some unnecessary political agendas. Like I said, Black Panther is a unique experience. One that certainly should be experienced in the theaters. My score: 8.0/10"

","Black Panther was so... AMAZING! I feel so speechless. It's about time we get a GOOD QUALITY film. Black Panther was hands down the best I've seen from Marvel to date. Please do yourself a favor and watch this film! Thor, who?! Iron Man, who?! Captain America, WHO?! Black Panther makes those other films seem like a circus. They've really outdone themselves with this one.<br/><br/>From a critical point of view, the storyline was fantastic and well developed. Marvel departs from their usual one-size-fits-all plot formula, making it difficult to anticipate every next move. Character development was so great that viewers can easily feel emotional attachments to the characters in times of happiness, sadness, pain, and fear. The colors and cinematography were just delicious. Even the costumes were downright amazing. Everything was just so rich! Marvel, THIS is how you need to make movies from now on."
"reddavepirate","10","10","41","16 February 2018"," A worthy addition to Marvel's epic front row of movies (NO SPOILERS)
","Well, I loved it and fully believe it walks with Marvel's best (which I feel are Captain America 2; Iron Man; Avengers; Thor Ragnarok; Guardians 2 and Doctor Strange).<br/><br/>Not because of the incredible visuals - wow. just extraordinary and rich and very, very well thought through as they were.<br/><br/>But because of the way the story meshes with the Characters/ performances (one needs the other and here you get both). It wasn't a wholly unique plot: Boy loses country, boy finds country/ a journey of self discovery in which the hero uncovers not all is what he thought it was.<br/><br/>But... the story was given a hero with conscience and a villain who didn't just want to take over the world because he wanted a gold toilet. My only concerns here were that I feel Whittaker was under- used/developed and Kaluuya's character arc unresolved (although perhaps that is a future focus). Boseman was magnificent. At turns both tortured and elated. Nyongo; Bassett and Freeman were all on their A Game. <br/><br/>Standouts for me personally though were Guirai; Jordan; Serkis and Wright. Both they and their characters worked excellently. In particular, I could watch these guys all day. I believe Wright could carry her own Black Panther sequel one day. Serkis was his powerhouse best and Jordan... well... his characterisation lifted it again for me. I could feel his anger and his 'cause'. The Director wisely left us to our own reflections on whether one of the two 'masked' the other or if they 'walked in parallel'. The 'cause' part was interesting as there was a real philosophical weight to that as in the best of Marvel. <br/><br/>The Winter Soldier asks if we have the balance right between freedom and protection and the Panther asks if are right to isolate ourselves - should we act or wait? Wakanda's isolationism may be illusory: is non-intervention really just a sin of omission? Heavy stuff, but Coogler proves up to the lifting for me.<br/><br/>Black Panther was everything I hoped it would be and I want to return to Wakanda now every bit as much as to the stories of my favourites, Captain America and Doctor Strange."

","This film tells the story of a super human who helps the prince of an African nation to succeed in the throne, and helps to prevent a war from breaking out.<br/><br/>It's refreshing to have an African superhero, and even more refreshing to have a film that incorporates a lot of African cultural and ethnic elements. I looked the scene where people in various running costumes gather sound a waterfall. That was spectacular. The story itself is very engaging, and it's great to see both traditional and superhero style fights in ample quantities. The cities are very stylish as well. It is a great blend of enough elements and futuristic elements. There are also plenty of rises and falls in the plot to engage the viewers. The visuals are great as well. I really enjoyed it."

","I saw it last night with a fellow comic book nerd in a theater with about 30 folks. Unfortunately, 20 of them were little kids who came on a church bus and talked loudly through the whole movie. The plot was solid and the action was great. The CGI was pretty bad in a few places, (a missing arm that you can kind of see). We liked the tech and there were a couple of laughs. The bad guy was believable with motivation that was on track. There was a romance that played well. Overall a great effort from Marvel. The politics kept us away and when I said it was 4/5 stars on FB it only took a few minutes before someone called me racist. Like Wonder Woman (which was also a 4/5 star film for me), they don't get the absurd statement. If you like a movie because it has a woman you are sexist just as if you dislike a movie because it has a woman. Same thing here with race. Race did not play into my enjoyment of the film. It was good. It wasn't in my top 5 superhero movies. Maybe my top 10. I'd recommend it. One of the best things about it is they kept it PG13, no cussing or nudity or over the top violence. I really liked that."

","Black Panther started quietly and with familiar faces and on familiar territory. Soon though, began to emerge, one after the other, these Black, Beautiful, Powerful, Graceful, Masterful characters, garbed in colorful and magical, tribal yet futuristic outfits (some resembling the Masai people,) in this fantastical land that is at once futuristic, highly Scientifically/Technologically advanced, and yet at the same time has managed to remain grounded in its ancient and tribal roots/ways. The cast selection was simply impeccable. Chadwick Boseman was a perfect pick for a King. His cool temperament and charisma coupled with his physical/mental/emotional/spiritual strength made him outstanding! The women in the rolls of Shuri/Nakia/Okoye/the Queen Mother and the whole Dora Milaje were phenomenal! From their physiques, to their masterly warrior skills, to their loyalty and love for their people and the country, to their fabulous costumes and accents, they present a wonderful array of what is black-feminine-beautiful-strong-fully evolved/mature- and committed.
The movie is packed with powerful visuals, action, and content. It offers so much that is new and different on so many levels. So, naturally my fist viewing experience was overwhelmed with just taking in the visuals and keeping up with the action as best as I could. The dense content will take time and hopefully more viewings to untangle. Overall, Black Panther, not only did it not disappoint, it inspired, it united, it healed, and I have to say after this introduction to Marvel I will now be on the lookout for similar releases in the future!"

"londerial","10","9","36","16 February 2018"," Cultural with Historic meaning and symbolism
","I think black panther is above your average marvel movie. In a sense it exemplifies the cultural existence and relevance of the African culture that hasn't been seen in marvel's previous movies. It feels good to see people of color actually being successful and motivated by honor. Black Panther not only was a hero,but he also helped out his community while staying true to his heritage. Kill-monger was raised without a father, in a sense he had an American way of living that was very similar to the selfishness and self centered american President that we have today. If you are racist at all, you will not like this movie. Why? because the cultural symbolism of the African culture constantly thrives on the Black race being the Superior being in this movie. From the technology to the clothes and style. Black Panther not only symbolizes just a super hero movie, but a culture that was once driven by black heritage but settlers took that land and until now it was forgotten. This movie will be historic, showing the power and strength of Black women. Although Black Panther was gone, his girlfriend stood by his side and saved him from death. The resemblance of stubbornness and strength in a very loyal Black woman. Black love that is. Black women thrived in this movie, being the body guards and fully trusted souls that Black Panther believed in. That not only created the technology for him, but they protected him. Something that will always be remembered in a time where our President shake's his head at third world countries :D."

"ashenafterglow","10","7","26","19 February 2018"," Phenomenal movie, best in the MCU so far!
","Hands down, this was head and shoulders above anything I expected from a superhero flick, and I say that as a long-time fan of both the MCU and X-Men franchises.<br/><br/>The cast is incredibly talented--all of them do a fantastic job, and it's amazing to see such a diverse group of actors and actresses from all around the world. The conflict at the heart of the movie addresses a nuanced problem of respectability politics, radicalization, and the responsibility that governments and/or those with power, resources, and authority have toward those without. The solution isn't treated as 'easy' or simple, either. There are no robots to punch, no alien overlords to blame and triumph over in the third act. It's human against human, both sides of the conflict have real and valid reasons for their perspectives, and that human connection makes it so much stronger and more resonant and more poignant. I felt for Killmonger as much as I felt for T'Challa, Shuri, and the others.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the many women of the film aren't there for window-dressing and eye candy and impossible T&A-displaying back-bends. They're intelligent players, they're part of the story, they contribute with agency of their own and obviously have the respect of their male compatriots. They're neither made into aggressive, 'angry' caricatures, nor helpless fainting flowers. This is the kind of intersectionality we should be expecting in media.<br/><br/>The setting and design and production of the film is superb on its own merits. The views of the capitol of Wakanda are brilliant--everything from the architectural designs of the structures, the materials used, all the way down to the written script and the gorgeous costuming and the way rooms are decorated and laid out is clearly and keenly not just following by rote repetition the same sort of skylines and designs you would expect to see in New York or London. There's a feeling of cultural weight, of history and time and the development of distinct values.<br/><br/>I've watched it twice so far, may go back for a third, and will definitely be purchasing the DVD when it comes out. Please support this movie. Show the studios that we want more like this--diverse casts, excellent and thoughtful scripts, and conflicts that aren't afraid to touch on real-world issues that affect many of the people who will go to see these movies, in one way or another."
"luismconceicaoo","10","7","26","18 February 2018"," WAKANDA FOREVER!
","One of the movies we most hoped for and was worth the hype all over.
For a source film I want to highlight the various action scenes and the characters behind this great movie.
Spectacular action scenes, surrounded by a fantastic soundtrack, made by Kendrick Lamar.
The mood is well placed and only used in the most appropriate parts.
Unlike the other Marvel movies, the characters demonstrate a certain charisma, in the case of Martin Freeman, who does a good job. The main character is still learning about everything and this is notorious throughout the film, something that is transmitted to the viewer. The villain is represented with a particular motivation, which causes the spectator to divide in certain parts, doubting if he should support the hero or the villain. But, the best of the film, are the women, the protectors of Wakanda and the king's family.
In short, Marvel was right in another movie that will belong to my top 3.<br/><br/>I was not surprised that this movie could be nominated for one or more Oscars, one of better characterization and the other of better photography.<br/><br/>WAKANDAFOREVER!!"
"burnettnicole","10","7","26","18 February 2018"," Exceeded my expectations, stuck with the comic book well.
","I was pleasantly surprised at how well the back story was for the various characters. So many times the movie just dives right in and your lost as to who the people are. Overall there was a back end to the main characters and the roles were true to who the characters were written to be. <br/><br/>I thought the movie was very well done, it was a little slow at some points but the high points were super high. Even the slow parts had a lot of story to them so it wasn't boring. I feel it is important to build up the story line so I loved every minute of it.<br/><br/>I liked that it stayed true to character. My husband had read most of the big comic series and I am a Marvel fan no doubt. Unlike the latest Thor Ragnarok which turned Thor into a comedian and was out of character... ... Black Panther stuck with the original story. And I LOVE THOR but was disappointed.... Anyway... About Black Panther...<br/><br/>I think this movie is definitely a must see. I know true Super hero fans will love it and it is good for the whole family, which in my opinion a super hero film should be. Great action scenes, creative story, excellent acting, fantastic costumes and the technology was outrageous. I think that was a breathe of fresh air. Not the same old story again and again.<br/><br/>Not to mention I enjoyed not getting cussed at every 5 minutes. The characters held their power and their parts very well. Bravo Marvel! Well done! Going again soon."
"paulijcalderon","7","7","26","14 February 2018"," Refreshing hero in a fun, but underwhelming narrative
","""Black Panther Down"" is the movie directed by Ridley Scott and starring Orlando Bloom for 2 seconds. Alright, I'm just joking. It's been a long day, but I got the chance to check out the new Marvel movie, which I had no real expectations for. The marketing didn't get me hooked and it all sort of felt underwhelming to me. But I wanted to see it since I liked the Black Panther a lot in ''Civil War'' with his ""I don't care"" attitude. The character did grow with his own little story arc, so when you see him now, he's become a more responsable man. The movie was fine in my eyes. It's your usual Marvel picture when it comes to story and visuals, but at least it's an entertaining flick with enough craziness to keep you locked in for two hours. That's something I feel that the guys at Marvel aren't afraid of anymore; to go all out with the comic book weirdness and sometimes campyness. Now they wanna embrace it. Which has been strongly evident in the last ""Thor"" movie. That's not to say that there isn't any grittiness, because there is. It's all combined into one here. I'll applaud them for going to new places. But the end result didn't stick out to be more than mainly a fun time with popcorn at the movies.<br/><br/>I would have probably changed the visual style more if I was the one making it. Can they use less green-screen next time, please? It's Africa! I wanna see the savannas and the fantastic nature sights. There's an over-reliance of just resorting to fake digital backgrounds rather than using real locations. The digital gloom over everything lessened the visual appeal for me. But, hey! That's just the look. How's the story? Yeah, it's decent. I liked the grounded stuff mixed with African culture and/or mythology. The Wakandan technology and civilization was jarring to me at first sight. Not even Tony Stark has that level of tech. It was too much of a future city for my taste. Although the question of why the Wakandan tech has never been heard of before is brought in the movie as a major plot point. So I thought it was nice that it was addressed. The characters are fun and everyone brings a nice charisma to the screen. Chadwick Boseman, Lupita NYong'o and Forest Whittaker give their absolute care to the movie. It's no paycheck day for sure. It feels like Martin Freeman basically just hanged around on set. I was happy to see him there though. Because he would see and react to Wakandan culture like we, the audience would. The villains are good, but like in most previous Marvel films; they get sidelined again. Andy Serkis brought a fantastic personality to his mischievous guy, but his screen-time is limited. That was an unwise choice. Michael B. Jordan (AKA Creed) is also very interesting and unique. Not very often these days when you can understand the villain's motive so well. The main group are, like I mentioned, good and all.. But, the biggest problem I have is that the story line goes to all the expected places. It's pretty much like ""we've done all of this stuff before"". I wasn't surprised by where the plot ended up going because it's usual business and all so going through the familiar beats. It would have been more fun with some different twists. The action is entertaining. You even get a ''Skyfall''-like casino scene, but with some additional slow-mo fighting, of course.<br/><br/>Did I care for the story? Sure. There are neat moments and a fun adventure with good heroes to root for. None of it was captivating enough to raise my enjoyment unfortunately. I could see the emotional things and what they were trying to do. But, I didn't feel it. Black Panther is a superhero I've known almost nothing about. That's the reason I decided to go in as blank as I could. I would have loved to have been surprised, but I got a fun action movie with like-able heroes instead. Ultimately the character is sort of a mix of ""The Phantom"" and ""Batman"". I'm a fan of both those two and if you haven't read the Phantom comics, then I would highly recommend them. I wanted to see more of the tone you'd read there. It's grounded, but it feels a little fantastical too. The jungle is dark and mysterious. Filled with many legends and roads to unknown adventures. Well, I think my review has ended up too long, so I'll wrap it up. I'm sure Black Panther can become even better down the line, if there's more focus on delivering something less predictable and maybe more personal. Oh, and delve into the mythology and the mysticism more next time. It did what it had to do; to entertain and make audiences feel familiar with Wakanda. Now my thought is that ""Infinity War"" better deliver. Show me what 10 years of this Cinematic Universe has been leading up to. Do not play it safe, please. Any way, ""Black Panther"" was fine. It's a good time, but it should have had more weight."
"dave-mcclain","9","8","31","16 February 2018"," an examplary Marvel movie, as original as it is entertaining
","""Black Panther"" (PG-13, 2:14), debuting in the second month of 2018, is the 18th feature film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is the first MCU film featuring a predominantly black cast. It's focused on the titular comic book character who was introduced briefly in 2016's ""Captain America: Civil War"". Building on that set-up, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) takes over for his deceased father as King of the fictional Wakanda and, with the title, inherits the abilities and responsibilities of the Black Panther.<br/><br/>It appears that the most technologically advanced country on earth is not the U.S. or any country in Asia, but is that nation in central Africa which has been able to develop incredible technology from a rare metal which is found nowhere else on the planet (which also helps the country to remain hidden from the rest of the world, which assumes Wakanda to be just another Third World nation in Africa). In the midst of their high degree of development, the people maintain their ancient culture and traditions which, in this film, represent a rich array of real-world influences from peoples across the continent. <br/><br/>Now that he is the king, T'Challa is responsible for safe-guarding Wakanda's unique capabilities from falling into the hands of evil doers from the outside world. (You know what they say, with great technology comes great responsibility... or something like that.) To do his job, T'Challa sometimes must become the Black Panther and use an impressive array of gadgets developed by his sister, Shuri (Letitia Wright), who is best described as MCU's Tony Stark meets James Bond's ""M"". Backing up T'Challa is a formidable army led by female warriors like Okoye (Dania Gurira) and loyal officials like Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya), a spiritual leader called Zuri (Forest Whitaker) and T'Challa's mother, Ramonda (Angela Bassett). T'Challa is going to need help from all of them (as well as from neighboring tribes and even a CIA officer, played by Martin Freeman) if he's going to stand against the likes of the evil Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and the lethal and power-hungry Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan).<br/><br/>""Black Panther"" is unique and terrifically entertaining. It fits nicely into the MCU canon, but still charts a course all its own. Its hero is every bit as able and impressive as any other MCU character. As in the plot of most superhero movies, lives are in danger and the fate of the world hangs in the balance, but in a new and creative way. The stakes may be the same, but the tone is different - because of the film's Africa-centric setting - but also in the issues raised and the questions asked. Enhancing it all, we get exciting action, terrific visuals and awe-inspiring cinematography, not to mention a fantastic cast which includes several Oscar winners and Oscar nominees. This a Marvel movie through-and-through (complete with Stan Lee cameo and cross-pollinating end-credits scene), but it's one of the most fully-realized and enjoyable MCU cinematic achievements to date.

The rest of the cast were bland and uninteresting, their story arcs were unnatural and there were many plot holes throughout the whole film. <br/><br/>The ending of the film has to go down as one of the worst movie endings I have ever seen, heavily politicised dialogue which was out of place within the context of the scene. <br/><br/>To summarise, poorly acted, poorly directed, poor CGI, forced humour, force-fed politics, weak and arbitrary character motives.

","So I loved this movie. I have literally never written a review, but here it goes. Sometimes critics are wrong, but they do have some education that we (the average movie-goer) do not. So for those of you saying the critics suck and the system is rigged- say it with your degree and some actual umph (cuz if you loved Ragnorock and then say the black panther story sucked- you are obviously paying attention to something other than the story). The theme of this movie is very clear and some issues that are really important to our culture were addressed. One reviewer commented the movie does not pull you in emotionally, and maybe that's true. However, I felt really connected to killmonger. I grew up in poverty and I'd be pretty pissed if my family had the option to help and didn't. I probably wouldn't go and try and take over the world, but hey I got the anger (which I can't say for most marvel bad guys). <br/><br/>The question of how should a people of privilege help those without will forever be part of humanity. And if you find yourself being particularly hateful toward this movie, you should probably check yourself. Someone said, ""when all you've known is privilege, equality feels like oppression."" If you think this only got ratings and made money because of the racial issues of today- you are most likely wrong. The movie is solid and much more significant to the time we live in than most marvel movies.<br/><br/>On the downside the CGI pulled me out of the movie a couple times and it is a marvel movie so it was fairly predictable. <br/><br/>Overall this is my favorite marvel movie thus far and probably will stay that way if they keep on the path they are currently on (this is written post-infinity war)."

I'm excited to see Wakanda integrate into the rest of the MCU. <br/><br/>At it's worst, this movie is overtly political aimed at taking advantage of the BLM movement and Marvel's attempt to be everyone's SJW.

It's mr freeman's turn and it seems we're sort on us actors as he was supposed to be a American
Y not just keep him British or even get someone else. But then I remembered I think marvel have used most American actors already<br/><br/>I def expected more action only action last around ten min in Korea 
Go watch Andy lau films better action in South Korea all thru 
To me people just scared of saying don't like it
I'm not
Reminds me when I was in USA when avatar came out everyone goin on how grt it was I walked out of cinema thinking what a waste of three hrs and never watched again how he conned studios to make 2-3-4 lol
Well it's like this with marvel we all like comic book movies but getting to many I mean pt 1-2-3 etc y not do Thor 4 hrs or avengers 4 hrs with break in between like yrs back Bollywood do. But no BECAUSE they want us lot to listen to PAID reviewers and press and waste our money it's s scam tbh needs stopping rt IMDb all dodgy scores but get away with it
I for one would welcome a independent review
Most press screenings they get Little keep sakes now I wonder what's in them I really do

"rudiirouxie","10","3","8","25 February 2018"," Excellence, pure excellence. ""SPOILED""
","GRADE : A
Favorite characters: SHURI. OKOYE. KILLMONGER. M'BAKU
This is highly recommended, I was scared that it won't live up to the hype but it did and exceeded it. the acting was pure excellent, Danai's character okoye was the greatest of them all. She was so powerful I could just feel it. ""Would you kill me, my love?"" moment was truly thrilling I just loved it. Her loyalty and skills as a leader and a warrior are just amazing. I might be a bit biased with Jordan as Killmonger because I love him so much but his acting was beautiful, I think I preferred his suit over the panther's. The golden tiger print on it is so nice and that scene when he transformed was just so smooth the cgi was amazing. Shuri.. oh shuri, Wright was perfect for this role. Funny, witty, intelligent and overall protective of her brother and mother, she is one of my favorites. M'Baku's character was simply brilliant and very funny, I loved his loyalty and honor. Him saving T'Challa was one of my favorite moments. His throne room was also one of my favorites, how it's built and how his throne is built was both amazing. T'Challa's character was also amazing but he was a bit overshadowed by the rest of the great cast. I can't wait for infinity war to see all those characters together and especially to see a stand off between Stark, Banner and Shuri.<br/><br/>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ""if u havent seen it idk what are u even doing right now"""

DC movies are crap , wonderwoman sh*t, justice league sh*t, came out to early poor acting just saying"
"saketkt","7","3","8","19 February 2018"," Epic Buildup to the Infinity Stone movie
","Marvel took a huge risk with black panther just before the release of The Infinity Wars. With a complete different tone as compared to other
marvel movies, the risk may not have paid off and it could have affected the frenzy around the final two movies with box office not performing
as expected. But, the movie turned out to be brilliant and Marvel continues to outperform DC on all levels (JL was a disappointment).
I think Marvel's formula for success is to have atleast a decent story line, like the trunk of a tree, rather than going all bang bang with
expensive grpahics. Then characters are introduced and developed just like branches of a tree over time. There are as many as nine diverse characters and
all of them are given sufficient screen time. The setting is similar to background where the tree (analogy) is growing. The set here is Wakanda.
The designers have done a marvellous job with the city, costume, and make up. The soundtracks bring an element of Africa beautifully binding Wakanda
and the characters. The dialogues are decent with tinge of humour and smartass lines.
Black panther (without revealing any spoilers) is a story of a prince who rights the wrong of his father in light of his death. TChaka created
the monster killmonger due to differences in ideology with his cousin. Klaue is another interesting character who smuggles vibranium out of Wakanda
and is responsible for death of Tchaka and other tribe leaders. TChalla is looking to avenge his father's death when he encounters Killmonger and loses
control over Wakanda in a straight duel to the throne with him. With help from Jabari tribe, Nakia, and Shuri; TChalla manages to defeat Killmonger and
brings about few changes for the first time as a ruler of Wakanda.
Now, coming to the ratings of the movie, there are five parameters on which I score movie out of ten. These are story (1), acting (1.5), aesthetics (2),
editing/narrating (1.5), Xfactor/uniqueness/fun (1.3) which totals to 7.3/10. My reccommendation is MUST WATCH.
I like to end my reviews by describing my favourite scene of the movie. Mine is- the car chase scene in which Klaue tries to escape and TChalla 
dismantles vehicles like toys by jumping over them and removing wheels with one hand."
"mr_bickle_the_pickle","7","3","8","19 February 2018"," Black Panther sinks his claws into the MCU
","It definitely is wonderful to see a big blockbuster film like this have a majority black led cast and not have the focus be on their oppression. Not that stories of slavery, racism & police brutality aren't important, but I think its important for little black kids to see themselves as Kings or Queens too, who also are self sufficient. So I hope this movie does trigger Hollywood to do more movies in a similar vein. Now with that aside, how does fall within the MCU for me? Overall, I enjoyed it. Though to be fair, there hasn't been a movie yet that I have really hated, a few that Ive been a bit disappointed by thats it. Im still re-evaluating my current standings (so this may change), but I think this is likely around the 5th best movie for me. There is a lot of stuff that is great. In particular I really liked Letitia Wright as Shuri. There's just such a brightness to her. She's incredibly delightful, smart, funny and gets to kick some ass too. Killmonger is a great villain. Hes not just lame villain the hero fights in the 3rd act and is defeated after 10 minutes. He has a presence throughout. He's also such a genuinely dark character who will literally kill whoever's in his path with little to no remorse. He'll blind side and double cross you if he gets the chance. I also thought Klaue was a lot of fun. Yes, he's a bad guy, but he's just crazy, chaotic kind of kooky and Andy Serkis breathes some life into him. There are also some gorgeous costumes and sets. A couple of funny lines here and there (my favourite was the vegetarian line) but it definitely doesnt focus on that too much. There were things I disliked or am nit-picky about. I eye-rolled so hard at the ""What are those"" line. Its a dated vine/meme/whatever. It was never that funny to begin with and feels like a cheap gag to get some kids in the theater to laugh. I didn't buy into Daniel Kaluuya's character motivations. There is that line about how Klaue killed his parents, so I understand he wants them dead, but it just doesnt seem believable how easily he turned on T'Challa. Also in accordance with his character, him and Danai Gurira are supposed to be in a relationship and yet we barely get any interaction between the two. I think the height of their interaction is calling each other ""My Love"". I assume they added it in because they wanted to add some stakes when his character supports Killmonger, but I didnt think it added anything. Im not saying we had to devote a 30 minute subplot to their romance, but a few more moments here and there may have helped to solidify them as a couple and make you care a little bit more later on in the film when you see them on opposite sides of the battlefield. Also, I dont understand how Angela Bassets hair SUDDENLY turns white. So yeah, a couple of grievances that stopped me from fully enjoying my experience, but overall a lot of stuff to like as well. I think if you're a fan of the MCU you'll like this one too."

To be honest most of the criticism I see about the movie is based on people not liking how ""black"" it is. The action was incredible, some of the best in any MCU movie yet. Black Panther himself is a great addition to the roster and things like the black panther ceremony among other things were great shout outs to the comic fans. Michael B Jordan as Killmonger would've been the best (he still argueabley is) villain they've had yet. I only wish they'd built him up a little more on screen, but his acting was great and the story behind him was a refreshing take on a villain. Marvel movies aren't meant to be Oscar worthy movies, they're feel good action blockbusters with some comedy thrown in, and they knocked it out of the park with this"

"rannynm","9","10","43","15 February 2018"," Pure Marvel Action/Adventure Steeped in Timely Political and Social Issues
","In the latest production from Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), we see the original story of the Black Panther. We were introduced to the Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War. This film depicts the story of King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) and the Black Panther tribe. 
 
When T'Challa returns home to the reclusive, beautiful and technologically impressive nation of Wakanda, a fictional country in Africa, he is named the new leader following the death of his father. True to custom, he is challenged by the tribesman and becomes the new King. <br/><br/>Elsewhere, a cousin unknown to him returns from the United States to challenge T'Challa's reign, and chaos ensues. Warmonger (Michael B Jordan) and his political beliefs are diabolical and the opposite of T'Challa's. As foes set forth to destroy Wakanda, Black Panther teams up with a C.I.A. agent and a neighboring tribe to prevent the country from a world war. The path from light to dark, and back to doing good in the world beyond Wakanda is refreshing.<br/><br/>The film is pure Marvel action-adventure with a broad political and socially aware feeling. It is awake and unique. It may be a superhero film, yet it is also steeped in real political and social issues similar to those we face today, especially diversity and inclusion. The strong female characters - Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ramonda (Angela Bassett) are phenomenal. 
 
I love this film! From the casting, cinematography and directing, to the special effects and female empowerment, it is fulfilling. The action is believable, many of the fight scenes are based on African martial arts, although the CGI at times is a little whack. Overall, I was displaced, forgetting I was sitting in a theater. The costumes are fantastic with attention to detail befitting royalty. Wakanda forever!<br/><br/>I give this film 5 out of 5 stars for the cast, social and political awareness, technology focus and female empowerment. This film will appeal to ages 10 to 18, as well as adults. I caution younger viewing due to fight scenes which may be disturbing.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Kimbirly O., KIDS FIRST! Juror."
"MrDHWong","9","10","43","15 February 2018"," A benchmark in the MCU and is easily one of its best standalone films
","Black Panther is the eighteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the sixth film in Phase 3 of the series. Directed by Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station, Creed), it sets the bar to an all time high for Marvel films and provides a brilliant lead-in to Avengers: Infinity War.<br/><br/>Shortly after the events of Captain America: Civil War, T'Challa/Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) returns to his country of Wakanda in Africa to be crowned as its new King. However, upon arriving home, T'Challa finds his position as King challenged by a old enemy whose intentions are far more sinister than merely seizing leadership over Wakanda and its citizens.<br/><br/>Featuring some of the best written supporting characters and action scenes in a Marvel film, Black Panther is a benchmark in the series and is easily one of its best standalone films. The film's world building element showcases the vibrant and futuristic look of Wakanda, a fictional African country proudly entrenched its heritage and tradition. We also gain a somewhat James Bond/Jason Bourne vibe from the film at times, with its spy thriller elements and exciting car chases. Director Ryan Coogler does a suburb job fleshing out the main villain Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), whose motives go beyond merely world domination and lust for power. Chadwick Boseman is fantastic as the title character, the serious but kindhearted King who only wants what is best for his people, as was briefly touched on in Captain America: Civil War. Like with every other film in the series, be sure to stay after the credits for two bonus scenes.<br/><br/>I rate it 8.5/10"
"geoff33","10","10","44","17 February 2018"," As Good as Most Super Hero Pictures
","Black Panther is a great movie with an excellent storyline. Each is entitled to their own opinion, but I am curious regarding the real agenda of those who are rating it with low scores. The movie is no more political or controversial than any other movie shown in a theater over the last half century. The dialog is often thought provoking and may generate some discussion because it acknowledges some of the world's social issues. It is action-packed and mostly family friendly. The fight scenes are typical for super hero films and the CGI is pretty good. Women and many other minorities have significant screen time and major roles in the development of the plot. The lead actors stars give the supporting cast room to share the spotlight. I highly recommend all DC and Marvel fans to see this movie and incorporate it into the debates and discussions about super heroes and villains. I expect many of these stars to show up again on the silver screen soon."

","The last time a movie surprised and impressed me this much was The Matrix. The opening scene of Trinity's escape was everything! I've probably seen 350+ movies since then, including the latest Star Wars, just about everything the Wachowskis have done and some brilliant martial arts movies out of Hong Kong. Many of those movies have been great and I'd rate a few of them a 10 (Inception and Get Out come to mind), but, Black Panther was a real surprise. <br/><br/>With a mostly black cast, and with all the historical significance of that, and with it being a Marvel outing, I was excited and hoped it would be good; but I wasn't expecting great. Black Panther is stylish and witty. The action scenes aren't gratuitous, pointless and just testosterone-fueled. Women kick ass and help to drive the story/action. It wasn't just T'Challa's story. The villain, women of Wakanda and others got their moments to shine. Probably the brightest star of the movie though is Ryan Coogler. He's now in the league of directors like Christopher Nolan who I'll always pay money to see their work. Coogler clearly has a unique voice and vision and he's impressed the heck out of me.<br/><br/>There were one or two things I didn't love (Andy Serkis didn't have enough scenes, for example) but those things don't distract too much from the movie.

"DCHybrid02","8","4","13","21 February 2018"," Intersting movie
","Like many people, I enjoyed comics as a child (I still do). However, being black, most of the characters I saw didn't look like me. Of course, I didn't really think about that until I was older. About that same time, I realized that the same racial disparity seen in comics exists in Hollywood, as well. Thus, I was intrigued by the notion of a Black Panther movie.<br/><br/>I wasn't going to see it in theaters, but I did a little digging to learn what the movie was about and it intrigued me, so I saw it during opening weekend. Since it's a comic book movie, I was apprehensive. They're typically enjoyable but have shallow plotlines. <br/><br/>Well, this movie managed to impress me. No easy feat. Why did it impress me? Because Ryan Coogler managed to incorporate everyday social issues into the movie. Most comic book movies deal with some supernatural issue. While that's fine, most of us probably can't identify with fighting aliens or other superpowered beings. <br/><br/>Before walking into the theater, I knew that Wakanda was supposed to be a technologically advanced country in Africa. A possibility of what African nations could be if they hadn't suffered the effects of colonization. So, I came in with a question. If Wakandans are so advanced, what are they doing to help their neighbors? I didn't actually expect the movie to address this question. Surprisingly, it did. When T'Challa considered breaking from tradition and sharing Wakanda's resources with others and admitting refugees into the country, one of his friends closed the matter by saying that refugees would bring their problems and make Wakanda just like any other country.<br/><br/>The villain of the movie turns out to be T'Challa's cousin. He believes that Wakanda should use its resources to arm the oppressed and help them defeat their oppressors. After a big battle, T'Challa decides that his cousin had a point about helping others rather than keeping the wealth to oneself, albeit he is less militant in his views. So, the movie ends with him pledging Wankandan aid to other countries during a meeting with the UN. It's an ending that I admired. So often, people are faced with the decision of helping others and we don't because we may not have as much as we once did afterwards. While Black Panther is a work of fiction, perhaps it will inspire people to pursue a more altruistic approach to life.<br/><br/>One of the things that I admired most about the movie was its casting choices. I hate to say it, but Hollywood has a tendency to cast white actors in minority roles. Thus, I was happy to see a predominantly black cast in a movie that's not one of Tyler Perry's. Not only that, but 4 of the characters we consistently see are women. Wakanda seems to be a society that views women as being just as competent as men. For instance, the royal guard is completely made up of women. It feels rare for me to see black women in roles that aren't tossed aside for the sake of a white character. Here, we see a quartet of women who act as T'Challa's closest advisors: a tech genius, a queen, a spy, and the head of his guard. I'd say that that they serve as examples of how black women can succeed in the world (if given the chance).<br/><br/>My only real qualm with this movie is the villain, Erik Killmonger. As I said, he presents a foible to T'Challa's pacifism. I'm fine with that. It actually reminded me of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Two men who have similar goals but different methods of obtaining said goals. I could sympathize with Killmonger right up until he killed and threatened people who were hesitant to do what he said. What's the point of lifting other Africans up if you're needlessly killing your own people to do it? Without this character trait, I would've still viewed him as misguided, but I could still respect his position and how he came to have it. However, being a sociopathic murderer made him look like every other bad guy I see in Hollywood. I don't even think Killmonger needed to be a villain. He could have simply served as the flip side of the coin on this debate over whether or not Wakanda should aid other nations. Then again, there probably would've been less action and this IS a comic book movie. Oh well.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. If you're a comic book fan, I'd suggest seeing Black Panther. It deviates from the typical comic book formula of fight some aliens, blow stuff up, and end the movie without actually doing or saying anything important. I think Panther does have something to say. It shows us a representation that defies the Western expectations of what an African country looks like. Even more important, Black Panther demonstrates altruistic behavior that we can aspire to as human beings. Give it a chance. You may be pleasantly surprised."

","Is the super hero movie genre running out of steam and making people feel fatigued? Probably yes, but what makes Black Panther stand out is that the audience is transported to a new land of Wakanda. Where we see diversity and culture. Where the message at the end is we don't just stand for ourselves anymore, but the world. We aren't seeing a superhero who is just discovering their powers in a neighborhood or city but instead a man who is to become king and making more of a bigger decision to not just helping his own people. This movie has fun action and great music that is influenced by this fictional country based in Africa. People have high expectactions for a formula that Marvel has been using for years now and that is why they come out disspaointed. Expect a fun movie with action and comedy elements with a few cameos or easter eggs, that is the way of Marvel. Black Panther stands on its own and is diversive enough as a movie like Guardians of the Galaxy to keep the Marvel momentum going."

","Black Panther is the latest movie from Marvel Universe based on the eponymous character. The movie is already a big hit across the globe. Team OI reviews the movie & tells you whether the movie is worth the hype.
we wish to inform our readers that, we are not die hard Marvel fans. We went to the movie with no expectations as such. But we were curious to learn as to why the world is going gaga about this movie.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with the story of how the Black Panther came into existence several centuries back. We are told that vibranium is the source of all the power of Wakanda. Wakanda is the Black Panther's kingdom in Africa. While Wakanda is advanced in terms of technology, they prefer to be isolated from the world. They decide to pose as a third world nation. King T'Chaka accuses his brother N'Jobu of assisting Ulysses Klaue & kills him. Post the death of King T'Chaka, his son - T'Challa returns to Wakanda to lay claim to the throne. Post becoming King & being bestowed with the powers of the Black Panther, King T'Challa unsuccessfully tries to nab Ulysses Klaue.
We are later informed that N'Jobu fell in love with an American woman. They had a kid together, Erik A.K.A The killmonger, comes to Wakanda to challenge T'Challa & lay claim to the throne. Does he succeed? Does Wakanda attack the world & end up ruling it as per Killmonger's plans? Watch the movie to find out.
Director Ryan Coogler must be credited for portraying Africans like never before. African culture has been brilliantly showcased in the movie. Africans across the globe are sure to be proud of this movie. The two duels involving T'Challa are excellently shot. This story moves at a brisk pace. One need not be an ardent Marvel or Black panther comics fan to enjoy the movie. Chadwick Boseman is excellent in his role as the Black Panther. He has set the benchmark in terms of portraying the superhero. He has perfected the African accent to suit the character. Michael B. Jordan as The Kilmonger is bad ass. His menacing looks & superb acting makes you hate him. There are several known African Americans in the movie. Martin Freeman who plays CIA agent Everett K Ross is good in his role. ever Forrest Whittaker(Zuri) adds weight to the supporting cast. The soundtrack is one of the best we have heard for the longest time. The music will haunt you for days or probably weeks.
There are no flaws in the movie whatsoever.
Go watch the movie without contemplating any further. This movie is a treat for people of all ages."
"guycorhuo","8","11","51","16 February 2018"," Probably the most important superhero movie till now
","It's quite funny to read so many derogatory reviews by Imdb users about this movie. Once seen it's obvious that they write it from a political agenda or from a very limited interest in entertainment movies or, worst, from a racist or sexist point of view.
I don't think that Black Panther is the best superheroe movie ever (The Dark Knight or The Avengers or Spiderman 2 are better from MHPOV) nor the most funny (Guardians of the Galaxy or Thor Ragnarok or Deadpool would be) nor the most entertaining (here the list could be longer including some of the previous titles I've mentioned) but I think that it could be considered the most serious take for a superheroe mainstream movie. 
The beginning of the movie with the not much subtle message of Wakanda First! and how this evolve for the main character along the story (whose end of evolution is certified in the first extra scene after the main credits) clearly tries to send a message to the trumpists (and probably a lot of them are reviewing very low the movie) Also it tries to send a message of reconciliation to those that want to revive the ala ""Malcom X"" ideology or revanchist actions (here one has to think about the riots caused by some judicial decissions when police officers killed some black people or due to the move away of Southern symbols) portrayed by Killmonger. Probably some machist and alpha males (maybe a lot of them lovers of the macho image that superheroes use to portray) could feel that a so equal depiction of women and men as Warriors (yes with capital!, leaded by Nakia and Okoye) or scientists (the perfectly seized and restrained funny Shuri) or whatever, threatens their comfort zone. It has a good story and as well structured as a perfectly narrated story has to; the hero has to suffer a change and it happens thanks to the lesson he learns from his antagonist. The perfect simbiosis of the two faces of human personality by the hero and his opposite.
Naturally this is a Marvel and Disney movie and these companies are not going to create a manifesto or a propaganda film hence they don't dig in those topics as an independent movie would do. Killmonger character lacks of a wider development and the talent of Michael B Jordan deserved it and the myth of Klaw in the comic books is roughly severed in behalf of the narrative but despite everything I think that being an entertaining production it offers much ideas than we are used to and as much as expected in terms of joy and fun."

It is the first-ever comic superhero movie that features a black person as the lead role (not counting Hancock, as that was not based off a comic book). It features a predominately black cast, and was directed by a black man, Ryan Coogler. It breaks some media stereotypes about black people, and it's really something.

"capaldimark","8","7","29","16 February 2018"," A fun, interesting journey despite a predictable storyline
","Finally the first the major release of 2018 is here in the form of Marvel Studios' Black Panther, which is the first comic-book movie based on a colored superhero. Co-written and directed by Ryan Coogler, this is a bold and mostly fresh take on the superhero genre. With all the hype being built around the movie, you may be asking, does it live up to it? The answer is, mostly. <br/><br/>The events of Black Panther take place shortly after ""Captain America: Civil War"", where T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns home to Wakanda to become the new king after the unfortunate death of his father. But the problem is that T'Challa doesn't believe that he is ready to follow in his father's footsteps and be as great of a leader as him, which creates some conflict within himself. This conflict and self-doubt however, must be put aside when a mercenary named Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) threatens to sell Wakanda's secret resource, vibranium, on the black market. T'Challa also has to deal with someone by the name of Erik Stevens aka Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), who has a surprising backstory that gives some depth to the character, which actually makes him a decent villain overall. Unlike most comic-book movies with multiple villains, this one handles them really well and never lets them make the story too convoluted, which can be credited to the writing by Coogler and Joe Robert Cole. <br/><br/>This is by far one of the most mature Marvel movies ever made and part of that is because of the performances by a talented cast that has a mix of veterans and newcomers. Boseman holds his own as T'Challa, Michael B. Jordan is solid as the main villain, and even Forest Whitaker brings something to the table as Zuri, one of the elders of Wakanda. The scene stealer here however is Letitia Wright, who plays T'Challa's sister, Shuri, who is basically the brains behind all of the advanced medical and warfare equipment that Wakanda has. It helps that she and Boseman have good chemistry with one another, making the brother and sister relationship that they have in the movie believable. What also makes this movie more mature than other Marvel films is the themes that it touches on. Some of the themes include racial, moral, and political issues that really make this movie seem a bit less like a typical action-packed superhero movie. The action scenes that are present in the movie are fine and exactly what you would expect, but the emphasis here is on the characters and themes.<br/><br/>Even though it is a more mature piece of work when compared to the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it still has that same formulaic and predictable plot that plagues almost every superhero movie these days, especially the Marvel ones. It even got to the point where towards the final act of the movie, I predicted exactly how everything was going to play out and sure enough, I was right. It's just your typical rise, fall, and rise again storyline that features a hero of some sort. But perhaps this is the problem with solo superhero movies that are set in cinematic universes, you already know which characters can and can't die, and this leads to the movies having the same predictable plot line that we've seen over and over again, and Black Panther is no exception. It's the only real major weakness of the film, but it's a big one.<br/><br/>All in all, Black Panther delivers an origin story that is more grounded in its characters and themes compared to most other comic-book movies, which was definitely something refreshing to experience. It's not this masterpiece that many claim it to be, but if you can get past its formulaic and predictable plot, you may find yourself smiling throughout this journey all the way up until Infinity War in May."
"WhyLieReviews","7","8","35","17 February 2018"," Black Panther is unfortunately the least best amongst the other marvel movies out there!
","I kept wondering how the story about wakanda's super secret city & strength be revealed to the audience. And I couldn't have expected any better, simpler, crispier father-son narrative on why wakanda is the way it is!
Black Panther covers most of Marvel's ingredients, but it feels to have gravely lacked in finding the proportions. There were hardly a couple of scenes that was really funny. Neither the story nor the plot felt fulfilling. Story was weak, didn't cover much but just revolved around the technical advances of Wakanda's super secret city and its rituals. Plot could have been better, didn't have much coverage either. VFX was really good, and that was it.
Killmonger was shown the main villain, but for some reason Klaw seemed a better and audience loving villain who got killed in a jiffy. Killmonger needed a stronger background and story showing him more competitive to the black panther, but it was just his muscles, attitude and an american accent that took more coverage (oh i missed ""Nay"". You'll know what i mean).
 Black Panther is not as much a negative movie as i might have made it sound, but the expectations for various reason were so high, that the movie just failed to meet it. Although it is a definite 1 time watcher, but one lacks the content of having watched a full-package Marvel movie simply because there just wasn't enough of everything.<br/><br/>Black Panther a one time watcher if you are a Marvel's fan. Else the film will interest you only in parts.
IMBD's 7.6 as on date is almost justified, although i would give it a 7.1/10 in the long term."

","Ok when to see this movie with not may hypes, for me was another Marvel movie with a hero that we didn't know well. Only saw him at Civil war and that it is all. So Prince and King T ' Challa of Wakanda what an amazing back ground history they have give us. This movies is not for those that are expecting a lot of actions with no explanation, This movie was direct to give us the vide that was creating another phase in Marvel. The color , the special effect where amazing but over all the history was the most that I took from this movie. I love how the represent their traditions, their culture and that important of family unity. <br/><br/>Prince or King T'Challa was amazing , now is understandable why they didn't cast any one else for this role he is Black Panther. As the lead role he make me felt all types of emotions watching the movie. He was just great I haven't other words to describe his excellent role.<br/><br/>As his love interested , I was amazing how they play with the character, she was an important support character, but you can also see that she was special for him. Making her an spy that care for people well been outside of the city of Wakanda, was a magic touch. She represent what other cannot see the reality of 3 world countries. The Slavery and trade of woman and children's for sexual favor.<br/><br/>There was two part that brought me back to my childhood favor movie Lion King and that only make even felt in love more with the movie. It was so much rich in almost everything.
The important that it to show to others the traditions and morals rights . This movie nail and that what make one of my top 5 marvel movies.

","I rather like this movie and if the central plot was a little bit less Hamlet I would have loved it. Don't get me wrong the central plot is engaging it just goes where you expect it to go at all times. The work done in both the writing and technical aspects to develop Wakanda as multilayered society rife with factions and internal conflicts is really cool and if nothing else the film makes you want to spend more time with this group of characters. I simply loved the art direction and costumes in this. It was like pan-African version of Lost Horizon.<br/><br/>The real standout was Killmonger. Easily Marvel's best and most compelling antagonist he is at once a righteous zealot, a fallen idealist and a twisted version of the hero. The writing coupled with Jordan's charismatic and forceful performance renders a perfect anti-villain to love. I hope they bring him back somehow.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the film featuring a nearly exclusively black cast. I think that is a rather shallow reading of the text. The film absolutely does contain parallels and commentary on the African diaspora and the African American experience but it goes beyond simply casting black people. It is really hard to not hear the implicit rebuke of Trumpianism in the final speech and character arch of Wakanda and her King. Like Winter Solider and Iron Man 2 the film contain pretty overt political material. It is a deeper more engaging film because of it."

"MJL_Uncensored","9","3","9","27 March 2018"," Marvel's Bravest Film to Date
","After my sixth, or maybe it is my seventh viewing of Black Panther, I am finally ready to review it (Don't judge me-I tend to demonstrate compulsive behavior towards the movies I love). So if you have not seen it, I will not spoil it for you, but I also won't hold back my enthusiasm for the first big-budget film with actors predominately of African descent and Marvel's first Black black superhero.
When Chadwick Boseman's portrayal of Black Panther debuted in Captain America: Civil War, I knew something special was on the horizon from Marvel, but I did not know just how special it would be as a film. The fandemonium had reached epic levels: people were dressing up for the movie, there were social media campaigns to bring kids to the theaters in groups, and my community was creating all kinds of badass dance challenges on YouTube to celebrate the film's release. So part of the reason I needed to see it so many times was to ensure that the hype and enthusiasm I was experiencing in my community had not robbed me of the experience of appreciating all the craftsmanship that went into this movie. Marvel intended for it to be big-thus the $200 million dollar investment-but they could have never anticipated a reaction like this. I also needed to be sure this film stood up under scrutiny after multiple viewings because I knew I was already on a cultural high that would bias my review. So by my fourth viewing, the hype had waned for me, and now I was evaluating Black Panther for what it was-one of Marvel's most poignant and influential films in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe). Yes, some people still don't know what that is.<br/><br/>The film opens with a bedtime storytelling of the history of Wakanda that catches the audience up to speed on everything in less than two minutes. Can someone please share this storytelling method with every studio exec who feels the urge to bore us to death with more origin stories? Please, and thank-you. The film picks up right after the events of Civil War with T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) seeking out his ex who's on an undercover operation saving hostages, only to use the opportunity to invite her to his coronation as king. How smooth is that? Using your inauguration to get the girl. Well, the funny part is, as fierce as T'Challa is on the battlefield, he is softer than a marshmallow soaking in hot chocolate around the woman he loves, i.e., Nakia (played by Lupita Nyong'o). It is little weaknesses like this that help establish T'Challa's humanity and his impending burdens as king. As said in the multitude of trailers, he is ""a good man, with a good heart, and it is hard for a good man to be king."" Moreover, T'Challa will learn that lesson the hard way. When an old Wakandan adversary-Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) shows up with an unknown black-ops soldier named Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), everything accelerates into a battle for the throne and the fate of society at large. As a Michael B. Jordan fan, seeing him decked out in tribal scaring and challenging everything T'Challa stood for, much in the way Malcolm X challenged Martin Luther King-was a cinematic feast like no other. Jordan's portrayal of the controversial Killmonger character manages to not only seduce you intellectually and but enthrall you emotionally. And Jordan's performance places Killmonger-a terrible character in comics-among the best on-screen villians in the MCU.<br/><br/>Black Panther is that rare superhero movie that manages to take on challenging social themes of race, the diaspora of black Americans, immigration, isolationism, and retribution for oppression, all without isolating any particular group. It manages to be both provocative and smart about its messaging without becoming condescending and heavy-handed. As an action film, Black Panther plays more like a spy film than a comic-book movie, much in the same manner as Captain America: Winter Soldier worked more on the level with a Jason Bourne-like thriller. What Black Panther lacks in bombastic action, it more than makes up for it with strong story-telling, establishing a beautiful new cinematic world, savvy action sequences, and phenomenal performances. Danai Gurira (The Walking Dead), Winston Duke as the compelling and hilarious M'Baku, and Letitia Wright as Shuri (the scene-stealing tech-guru of Wakanda that'll give Tony Stark a run for his money) all manage to provide depth and heart to this fictional world in a way that takes most films multiple sequels to achieve. Black Panther's attributes far outweigh its occasionally choppy CGI and accelerated third act which is my only complaints. Ryan Coogler manages to create such a compelling world that this 2-hr and 20-minute film (which is long by any action film standard) never quite feels long enough. Wakanda is such a marvel to look at that you will want to explore it beyond the capital city, rural areas, and marketplace settings we are limited too. Maybe Avengers: Infinity War will give us a bigger bite of the Wakanda pie before Thanos arrives.<br/><br/>Black Panther works as a standalone film-connected to the larger MCU by Agent Ross, Klaue and a surprise character in the post-credit scene. A compelling script is what happens when the MCU grows up and recognizes that there is a bigger world out there. It is diverse. It is beautiful. Moreover, it is full of engaging human stories waiting to be wrapped in the blanket of fantasy to tell the type of universal stories that only good science fiction can tell. Black Panther takes the MCU into new territory: a world where heroes can emerge from parts of the world that are often ignored in America. It also takes the MCU in a much smarter direction without ever losing what made the MCU so special in the first place-fun and fantasy. If anything, Ryan Coogler's fantastic direction of Black Panther has just expanded the world, much in the way King T'Challa hopes to-eliminating the day where a black superhero is a rare event."
"nyadenyai","10","3","9","22 March 2018"," Killmonger is Crazy yet People still like him
","In my honest opinion, Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger is crazier than Heath Ledger's Joker portrayed in the Dark Knight Trilogy. Yes; Heath Ledger; Ledger is a better actor than Jordan but the characters master-plans are at two different levels. The Joker wants to see Gotham burn as a crazed way of getting into Batman's head while Killmonger wants revenge against his father's murderer along with revenge against Caucasian-Western-Society for its colonial mind-state.<br/><br/>I found it surprising that people liked Heath Ledger's Joker but still saw him as crazy while people also like Michael B.

My dad is kinda sick of superhero movies save for a few Marvel movies and one DC movies like Wonder Woman, but I wanted him to see this movie before it left the theatres and we came in with low expectations. Boy, we were wrong. This film picks up years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, in which Black Panther debuted on screen for the first time, as the main character, T'CHalla (Chadwick Boseman), deals with the passing of his dad from an assasination that was shown in Civil War, and is on a quest to become the next king of Wakanda, the world from which he was born into. The only thing standing in his way is the Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), who is the main bad guy of the movie. Chaos then ensues before all is settled in the end. Make sure you stay during the credits for two scenes, one in which Black Panther is at a UN meeting promoting world peace and before the movie's over Bucky Barnes as White Wolf, who will play a big role in Infinity War guiding T'CHalla's little sisters' team against Thanos and his army. I suggest you see it in 2d, as this film was converted in 3d just like every other MCU movie. The special effects are ok, the surround sound is amazing, and cinematography is amazing. Not only that, but there's lots of action, suspense, some humor, and as usual, a cameo by Stan Lee, this time in a casino scene reminiscent of a James Bond movie. The director of this movie also worked on Creed, not to mention Fruitvale Station. I can't wait to see what the sequel promises after the events of IW. Wakanda Forever!!!!"
"draketomb","10","3","9","15 March 2018"," Different and meaningful
","The story was great and the moral of the story was so refreshing. It wasn't an overly ""comical"" fest like Thor was. It was serious and had a great story that really emphasizes the conflict between African culture and Black-American culture. I think a lot of people missed that. The moral of caring/sharing honestly made this movie more enriching than other marvel movies. I have to agree that it didn't feel like a ""superhero"" movie but neither did Gardians of the Galaxy..yet it's still marvel. It was an intro to Black Panther, and he will continue to grow as a superhero. The death of the antagonist was a little anti-climatic and was expected but other than that it was rich in culture and had breathtaking visuals. The ratings on here seem to come from a bunch of white people who don't understand culture or stepping into other peoples' Shoes. (This is coming from an asian guy) it's not a hype for nothing!!! It's a great movie, if you can't relate to it that doesn't mean it's a bad film!! You're just a bad viewer!!"
"Prismark10","6","3","9","13 March 2018"," Fight the power
","Marvel Films have their formula down to a fine art. Even their lesser known heroes are making hit movies.<br/><br/>T'Challa made his initial appearance in Captain America 3: Civil War. In Black Panther he returns to his mystical homeland of Wakanda to become king after the death of his father. Wakanda so far has kept his its powers, wealth, resources and technology hidden.<br/><br/>However T'Challa's late father hid a dark secret about his own brother, who wanted to use force to aid his fellow black brothers in the USA. Now the dead brother's son, Killmonger wants to battle T'Challa for the throne and he wants Wakanda to lead the struggle for black power and cause chaos around the world.<br/><br/>The film pulls a nice trick in having two foes, at first we are led to believe it is going to be Klaue.<br/><br/>However I found the film rather choppy and in some ways predictable. At times I kept thinking back to the Lion King.<br/><br/>I liked that Marvel is not afraid to enter the debate about discrimination and whether it is right and legitimate to use force to overcome it. It is something Marvel Comics has tackled from its early days.<br/><br/>A well mounted, good looking action film but it lacks substance. The box office figures are shocking. It is good but not that good."

","Marvel, and Disney definitely delivered with Black Panther! The story was formulaic, and somewhat predictable, BUT freshened up by Marvel/Disney. The movie was well acted, and showed a different view, especially of Africa. There were a few missteps/goofs,, but they were so minor that the movie wasn't affected at all.(Ie: It has implied that Killmonger flew from Korea to Africa, in a small prop engine plane, without refueling, which can't be down with modern small prop planes(unless he used Vibranium.....hmmmm) and why go through the effort to rescue Klaue, just to kill him at the plane?) <br/><br/>The naysayers either are doing anything/saying everything they can to take down the movie because of the majority black cast(and their hate is guiding them), or just totally miss the point/are too ignorant to understand."
"jmcd2007","10","3","9","9 March 2018"," One of the best films of the year!
","""Black Panther"" is one of the best films of the year in my opinion! The all-star cast is superb and Chadwick Boseman is the perfect fit for the role of T'Challa, otherwise known as the ""Black Panther."" The film itself is also visually stunning as well. <br/><br/>Aside from tackling real world issues that relate to oppression, the film also follows T'Challa as he works his way to the throne in a fictional third world country known as ""Wakanda"" which is based in Africa. Meanwhile, he also works with CIA agent Everett Ross and a few of his natives to try and stop the villainous Ulysses Klaue from stealing any more Vibranium whilst trying to get an ancient artifact back from him that Klaue and his thugs stole from a British museum earlier in the film.<br/><br/>Klaue ends up ultimately betrayed and murdered by Erik Killmonger, son of N'Jobu, so that he (Erik) could challenge T'Challa for the throne back in Wakanda. Killmonger ends up defeating T'Challa and throws him down a waterfall. Fearing that T'Challa has died, the natives of Wakanda reluctantly crown Killmonger as their new king. Killmonger's reign is short lived, though, as we find out later in the film that T'Challa has been saved by one of his natives. Later in the film, we see that T'Challa is mostly covered in a snow / ice like material and it is this material that revives him. <br/><br/>T'Challa and some of his natives then develop a plan to overthrow Killmonger. A massive battle commences and this puts both T'Challa and some of his natives briefly at odds with one another as who to protect and who to defend since Killmonger was just crowned the new king of Wakanda. Quickly seeing Killmonger as ""too hateful"" however the natives eventually turn on him and start defending T'Challa once again. Killmonger later dies in front of T'Challa. T'Challa himself is then rightfully reinstated as king of Wakanda. Just as the film ends, we see that T'Challa is in California with one of his natives. They are standing in front of the same building that his father and uncle were once in (it's basically like an apartment complex and was featured in the beginning of the film). T'Challa then mentions that has plans to turn it into a wellness center for Wakanda natives. The film itself then draws to a close shortly after that. <br/><br/>Lastly, Bucky Barnes from the Avengers is also shown at the very end credits sequence and is referred to as the ""White Wolf."" Stan Lee also has his traditional cameo in this film as well. <br/><br/>In summary, this is a film that I would definitely recommend to anyone. Once this releases to Blu-Ray, I will definitely be picking it up! No matter if you're a fan of the Marvel films or not, this film is definitely worth your time and money!"

","Notable hand gestures, stunning outfits, exceptional music, talented cast, engaging story and beautiful imagery are subtle descriptions of the MCU's current installment. <br/><br/>Black Panther makes it the MCU's 18th movie and 8th solo film; given the metric, it would have been natural to be experiencing diminishing returns or even fatigue from the studio but it is the total opposite. Black Panther had so many strong points which makes it hard to elaborate on one. I understand that they focused more on the politics as opposed to action but it remains endearing. The best characters were Shuri, Nakia, Okoye, T'Challa and N'Baku. Erik Kilmonger is a villain we've never experienced in the MCU before in which Marvel has been doing great in the villain department lately. Special mention to Ryan Coogler for his amazing work on this film, I could see the combination of his style and Marvel's formula during the film which resulted in a masterpiece. <br/><br/>Since we've been introduced to the fictional world of Wakanda and its vibranium, high expectations are set for the sequel. Now the hype is geared towards AIW, the Marvel Cinematic Universe's 10 years culmination."

"ashishagupta","6","3","9","6 March 2018"," Marvel's fantasy version of Obama vs. Trump and 'Lord of the (Vibranium) Ring '
","The Black Panther is written to be to pander too many different types of people, and in the end impresses no one and draws a 'meh' from everyone.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, the movie is the story of the 'black panther' becoming king and learning that 'heavy lies the head that wears the crown' in the process.<br/><br/>It is a comic book movie and seems to be written for kids. The characters lack depth. There is a fair bit of hyperbole and even over-acting in some scenes, which might appeal to the younger audience.<br/><br/>There are several plot holes and some attempts to conceal plot holes are ill explained and contrived for the sake of subsequent action scenes. So, it seems the writers made and attempt to create a coherent narrative but did not do a good job of it.<br/><br/>If the movie kept itself to a simple comic action movie fanfare, then it would be fine. Unfortunately, the movie delves into mature territory of race issues and falls woefully short of reasonable treatment of this serious topic.<br/><br/>Implicit in the movie is the confrontation between the politically left-wing 'black panther' and his right-wing cousin. As the movie progresses, the black panther becomes a politically centrist (essentially Obama) and the antagonist becomes ultra right-wing (almost Trump). Consequently, Black Panther could also have been called Obama vs. Trump. The Republican audience in US would call the writers of this movie as 'snowflakes' for the movie is clearly biased in favor of the left-wing 'black panther'.<br/><br/> The humor in the movie came from the confrontation between Gholum (Andy Serkis) and Bilbo (Martin Freeman) as they were both after 'Precious Ring' (Vibranium metal) which gives great power for global conquest. Martin Freeman also plays the 'token white friend' in the movie where the joke is the inversion of the 'token black friend', but Martin Freeman's character has to be schooled in movie logic that 'token friend' has no meaningful dialogue.<br/><br/>Overall, Black Panther could and should have been much better than it was. It had the obligation to make a bold statement without the need to pander to people's prejudices. That after all is what art is!!"

"Alanaji_16","Null","3","9","21 February 2018"," ""BLACK PANTHER""- My Review
","Just like we were introduced to Asgard in the Thor trilogy (although it was more fun in the the third movie), Black Panther introduces us to Wakanda, a place/Kingdom, hidden from the outside world in the continent of Africa.
Directed by Ryan Coogler, The plot follows the events after Captain America: Civil War, where T'Challa a.k.a. Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman ) , is to be crowned the king of Wakanda where he have to face his nemesis in the form of Erik ""Killimonger"" (Michael. B. Jordan) who has a past related to Wakanda.
Now I have to say that this is a more matured movie after Civil War. There is action and fun in good amount but the story is given more depth. Add to that the African Culture and background gives the film a new look and from the view of the MC universe.
Technical matters of the film are all done well. Be it the Cinematography, Editing ,Action or the exhilarating Background score..
Now to the performances...
Chadwick Boseman has done a perfect job as The Black Panther. Although he appeared in a brief role in Civil war, the depth of his character was felt more in this film. Equally brilliant was Michael B Jordan in a negative role bringing in the required menace and can be considered another best villain in the MC universe. The supporting cast was efficient. The ones who require a mention is Daniel Kaluyya,
Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Lupita Nyong'o and Letita Wright. Andy Serous in a small role has done well.
So all in all Black Panther is another feather in the cap of the MC universe and is a must watch...
My rating: 4/5"
"nctracksquirrel","8","3","9","20 February 2018"," ""Black Panther"": I'm not going to ride the HYPE TRAIN, but I enjoyed this movie.
","I'm going give the GOOD, BAD, and VERDICT.<br/><br/>GOOD: Characters- To be quite honest, I thought it was extremely spot on with the casting for this film. Everyone brought their A game to do their character for this film. This is one of the few marvel movies that every single character has a time to shine and has a purpose for being in the movie. <br/><br/>Humor - It does a great job with its humor for the most part for not making it feel forced. It flows extremely well in this movie. They used it in a way to not put a joke in there to take a character's behavior out of place. It's in a way that they use the character's personalities as tools to set up and make a joke, which is fantastic and real. <br/><br/>CGI (PART 1)- The CGI they use in most of the scenery was really nice to look at. They make Wakanda look so beautiful and alive, also the way they use it for the technology in the movie is extremely impressive. <br/><br/>Action- The action in this film might take a turn for some people, because it's really different and unique compared to some past MCU movies. It goes more towards a ""Raw, Brutal, Tribal type of fighting style."" I first it took me awhile to get used to it, but then I ended appreciating the way they did it after the movie. <br/><br/>Villains- Everyone probably heard that Erik Killmonger played by (Micheal B. Jordan) is one of the greatest villains in the MCU, tied with Loki. I'm here to say: ABSOLUTELY!!! His character has a presence about him that he is really threatening. You also get a feel towards him that you say: ""I know that your methods are wrong, but on terms of what your goal is, you have a point."" You understand his reasons for what and why he is in the movie. Klaw was very entertaining to watch on screen as well. He was very enjoyable to watch with Andy Serkis' energy for the character.<br/><br/>Score- The music in this film is great, I enjoyed every single song that came with each scene. (I might end up buying the album.)<br/><br/>BAD: 2 MAJOR ISSUES: <br/><br/>1. the third act, kind of lost it's way and it became ""Let's stop the bad guy"" rush mode.<br/><br/>2. I think the movie should have been a tad bit longer. To put a little more depth for the third act. Also to give Erik Killmonger a little more screen time for his presence was a key to keep the flow of the movie going. <br/><br/>VERDICT: But overall I had blast watching this film for it's great development, characters, unique style, overall story, and understandable motives. I highly recommend watching if you are a huge Marvel fan!!! 7.8 out of 10"

"dcvetko","7","3","9","19 February 2018"," A fun Marvel-style superhero entertainment
","I just came from the cinema after hearing rave reviews about Black Panther over the weekend. I was looking forward to seeing it before it became the #1 topic everywhere after seeing the character of T'Challa introduced in Civil War, but I guess I kind of allowed the reviews to influence me going into it because I was expecting something truly unique and special. And as the movie went on, I was having fun but I was waiting for those outstanding, memorable moments to arrive. They sadly never did.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Black Panther made me feel the same way I felt after watching many of the MCU movies that I liked- it was a fun ride, but one I'm probably not going to go on again. <br/><br/>What I liked most was the overall look and feel of the movie. Wakanda was stunning, offering a blend of sci-fi tech with more traditional African look that's rarely seen in superhero films and for me it worked. I really loved all the ritualistic elements of this fictional society, their tradition, individual styles, hierarchy and so on. Almost every moment on Wakanda was a good time. I also liked the performances from this cast, Chadwick Boseman and MBJ stood out and delivered it most of the time, whether in dramatic or more comedic moments. Action was also good, however I feel there wasn't enough of it. Black Panther action moments from Civil War were more memorable to me than the one's from his own movie.<br/><br/>On a bit of a negative side, the pacing didn't always work for me making the movie feel a bit long. I wish more time was dedicated to Killmonger and his clash with T'Challa, both physically and ideologically. The middle part in Korea was fun but felt a bit pointless in the end. The end fight between two panthers was a bit of a letdown, set in a tight, dark environment. Also, it looked very much like a video game by the end, kind of like Justice League, with both characters looking like they were digitally made for the entire fight. The political and social themes in the movie were not very subtle, as expected. <br/><br/>In the end, I got from BP what I really should have expected, which is not a bad thing. Great look and feel, good, effective soundtrack, solid characters and mostly fun action made this an entertaining 2 hours in the cinema."

","19 February 2018
Second Film of Choice at tHe Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Black Panther. Time for another Marvel production. This was not your usual Marvel film. However it was fabulous. What made this one different is we were not bombarded with lots of superhero stuff this was more a tale of sci-fi folklore which erupted from a hidden city in the depths of Africa onto the rest of the world. This was a tale of who wins the throne and who is worthy to carry on the name and the work of Black Panther. There was much solemnity in this film interspersed with irreverence at solemn moments which elicited burst of laughter from the audience. Although slow it parts I felt this was necessary to the storyline and kudos must be given to the model makers and animators for creating a city fitting of both a metropolitan situation and an African savannah. Great use of rhinos, and some rather fancy intense battle scenes. I like the panther suit and the technology which comes with it. It was a little like watching Q from James Bond with all his gadgets, only way cooler. Although very different from the usual Marvel film I do feel this slots neatly into its place in the franchise. Once again people.......don't leave before the end of the credits.....two extras this time!!!!"
"talkatech","10","3","9","19 February 2018"," The future has arrived, and it is AMAZING.
","Black panther was EXCELLENT and AMAZING, a movie that has somehow managed to capture and display so many of the rarely touched on thoughts, ideas, desires and needs of all people, from ancient times to our present, especially those of us who are of color. This movie portrays and expresses some things that are very rarely seen or heard of in any movies that we presently see on tv or in theaters. Black men in power successfully leading others, respected intelligent and creative Black women, Black people working together to achieve things, sharing technology, key phrases that are prophetic to those who understand the changes that are occurring right now in our world. This movie itself is a multi-layered anomaly that terrifies some who understand the power of movies and music to influence real world societies. YES, it is exceptionally entertaining and definitely stirs the pots of racial biases, cracking and reforming the molds of what we are used to seeing and hearing on our screens. This movie is blazing a whole new path to the future and opening minds of the money makers to new ideas being possible and profitable. This is why ""the haters"" are doing everything they can including falsely rating the movie poorly, to stop people from seeing this movie. THIS MOVIE IS JUST THAT GOOD. GO SEE IT FOR YOURSELF, and enjoy a glimpse into the future expansion of movies and music to come. Of course Black Panther isn't to be avoided or feared... unless... you're one of the bad guys... if so... your fear will be your downfall... BLACK PANTHER IS HERE ... The concepts, the ideas and the movie. Long live Wikanda."
"omgitsdlb","8","3","9","17 February 2018"," Stop giving ridiculous exaggerated scores just to get noticed!
","What's with all the Panther bashing?<br/><br/>A wide mix of user reviews is fine and perfectly normal for a big budget blockbuster, but 1 and 2 star reviews for an extremely accomplished popcorn flick is unacceptable.
I am not usually one to defend the critics (for me, their recent cynical critique of The Greatest Showman completely missed the point of the movie), but they generally have Black Panther spot on, at a time when Hollywood is finally starting to face some of it's demons.<br/><br/>Let's deal with the big black elephant in the room first...
I felt very uncomfortable recently when I heard a local radio DJ recommend the movie ""...that stars Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis"".
Basically the only two white actors in a movie which is quite deliberately (and justifiably) NOT white.
It's a black superhero movie - big deal right?
Most of the cast and crew are black - that actually IS a big deal, and has some pretty major relevance too if you've followed the news even slightly over the past few years.
That fact alone though is probably a good reason to sign a petition or turn up to a rally but not necessarily a reason to go to the cinema. So let's move on.<br/><br/>The action is great fun without being too excessive. The vast majority of characters are well fleshed out compared to the usual 'making up the numbers or two many cooks' in these films. And it has just the right amount of heart and mind without diluting the genre. I thought it also just managed to be different enough from the other MCU flicks to have it's own identity. Which is an achievement in itself at a time when they're churning out three of these babies a year.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I really enjoyed it and so did my kids.<br/><br/>Sure, there's some overlong sequences, poorly delivered lines and the odd dodgy special effect, but that criticism can be levelled at ninety percent of the multiplex movies nowadays.<br/><br/>Personally I was very happy to see a big budget, mainstream film that gave significance to more than just one or two non-white characters. BUT MORE THAN THAT, I was proud to take my young (white) daughter to a family film that featured a range of strong women who did much more than just spend the duration pouting, bitching or trying to make love to the camera.<br/><br/>So if you don't like minor elements of social, political or topical discussion in your blockbuster I suggest you stick to Michael Bay films. If you don't like the way different movie directors are putting their own stamp on your beloved comics, stick to the comics.<br/><br/>I've only seen it once, but I'm still trying to decide if Black Panther might topple Civil War as my favourite Marvel movie so far.<br/><br/>Like it? Great. Don't like it? No problem.
But the 1 and 2 star reviewers can go suck balls, watch the Emoji Movie, and stop insulting most people's intelligence.<br/><br/>I give it a solid 8/10."
"PyroSikTh","8","10","47","14 February 2018"," Black Panther is one of the most Stylistically Unique movies in the MCU
","Black Panther kicks off really promisingly with an animated/CGI prologue that establishes the history of Wakanda and why they're as secretive as they are, before jumping to 1992 in California and a conflict between King T'Chaka and his younger brother who's been placed as a spy in Oakland. This second prologue sets the stage for the ultimate T'Challa/Killmonger conflict that plays out later in the movie, but I'll admit it takes a while to get there. Instead Black Panther decides to build slowly, spending it's time on developing characters and world-building to establish the cultures and technologies of Wakanda, a previously unseen fictional country of the MCU.<br/><br/>But honestly, I didn't mind the slower pace, because the world-building is so good. Wakanda is a nation built from five tribes, and each of them are drastically different from one another, with their own technologies, their own role in Wakandan society, and their own fashions and associated colours. T'Challa's tribe is the royal blood, the keepers of the Vibranium and the spiritual realm, including the spirit of the Black Panther that gives him his powers. There's a border tribe that lives on the outskirts of the country and keeps outsiders out. They appear more impoverished than the rest of the country, but of course it's only a front to save face. They live in huts, breed battle rhinos (you read that right), and have technology that revolves around shielding and defence. There's also the river tribe adorned in shells and turquoise colours, the sun tribe emblazoned in gold, and the outcast mountain tribe who cause a minor nuisance every chance they get.<br/><br/>Honestly Black Panther's biggest strength is it's costuming/makeup and production design. There is no other movie that looks like Black Panther. It's aesthetic that marries traditional African designs and colours with wealthy/futuristic tech and architecture is unique. One of the River Tribe is a dapper-looking guy in a turquoise suit with traditional African lip plate, which is an equally bizarre and awesome aesthetic. General clothing is emblazoned in African patterns and colours with a modern stylising, and many characters show off tribal tattooing like facial scarification. Many walk around barefoot despite the obvious advancements in technology to be able to craft shoes and sandals (both of which T'Challa wears himself). The cityscape is full of futuristic skyscrapers topped off with African huts and buildings.<br/><br/>But the traditional African aesthetic just stop there, it also leaks into the music, combining effortlessly with both modern Hip-Hop and your typical flavour of orchestral film score, sometimes all at the same time. I'm listening to the Kendrick Lamar-curated accompaniment album now and I'll admit I'm not digging it (although Pray For Me with The Weekend is pretty good), but the film's score is a different entity entirely. It makes a lot of use of African percussion, with the talking drum being instrumental in the film's audible identity, being used as both a main theme for the film, as well as providing some really good tension. As well as this there's often a typical hip-hop beat that comes in and out and instantly makes any and every scene it's used in feel inherently cooler and more badass. The orchestral element is, in typical Marvel fashion, still a little by-the-numbers at best, and just plain misused at worst. Even so Ludwig Goransson has crafted probably the most unique score Marvel have ever enjoyed (better even than Ragnarok, and Guardians doesn't count because that was all licensed).<br/><br/>But I feel I've been focussing too much on the stylistic merits of Black Panther. They're undoubtedly the film's strongest suites, but that doesn't mean the rest of the film falls to the wayside. The story takes a while to pick up, it's true, but once it does it becomes full of political intrigue, and drives home it's message of worldwide responsibility. Killmonger is a fairly typical African-American who feels entitled by virtue of his skin colour, while ultimately not really understanding what his heritage means. He wants to use Wakandan tech to destabilise the world's governments and put Africans on the top of the world ladder for once. Meanwhile both Nakia and Shuri see the potential in Wakanda reaching out and providing aid to the countries that need it. While both viewpoints are stark opposites, they both revolve around Wakanda ditching its secretive nature and taking a more diplomatic standpoint on the world stage.<br/><br/>Killmonger as a villain isn't too bad. While I wouldn't say he's a great villain in his own right, when compared to the rest of the Marvel villain roster, he's certainly one of the more developed ones. Wronged at a young age, he seeks to return to what he sees as his birthright. He has motivations and an intertwined history with T'Challa and the Wakandan royal family. I mean, compared to the likes of Malekith or Kaecilius, Killmonger is a breath of fresh air. Similar could be said of Andy Serkis' return as Ulysses Klaue, who is also not a particularly engaging villain in his own right, but Serkis just chews up the scenery (not only that, but beefed up with a tightly grown beard, and a waistcoat barely big enough to contain him, he's looks pretty badass).<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman gets almost the entire movie to flex his muscles as T'Challa, and manages really well to keep him the wise-beyond-his-years king. I'm not entirely convinced he can hold a whole movie himself though, as Black Panther was definitely kept afloat more by its supporting cast than by its lead. Luipta Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Martin Freeman, Winston Duke, and even Sterling K. Brown's small appearance all join together to give the movie an acting backbone to be proud of.<br/><br/>Is Black Panther one of the best Marvel movies to date? I don't think so. It doesn't always hit the mark, and it's action sequences just become a blur of boring choreography, and its story is an interesting one, but feels a little diluted and probably too on-the-nose. From a stylistic viewpoint though, Black Panther not only stands out from the crowd of Marvel movies, but from blockbusters in general. I can't wait to see more of Wakanda in a few months come Infinity War. I give Black Panther a solid 8/10."

It's a lot more about this country deciding whether or not it should release its technology to the rest of the world.<br/><br/>The end credits assure us that the Black Panther will be in the next Avengers movie. This movie is simply beautiful to look at. Every time we get a good look at Wakanda's world, it's a visual delight. It really downplays the aspect of it being in the Marvel Cinematic Universe .

Movie gives a clear image of Wakanda.
Killmonger could have said more than just one liners.<br/><br/>Some scenes were obvious green-screen and the CG fight was distracting and terrible (Is marvel getting lazy with it? I mean they have huge budgets for these movies and they still couldn't deliver a proper blend of real action and cgi like they did in some of their previous films)<br/><br/>It was an alright movie, falls short by the third act. If you watch the trailer you kind of get the gist of the movie

Forgot to mention, this movie is completely unrelated to infinity war, no teasers even. They kind of baited us into watching this by showing scenes of wakanda in the infinity war trailer"

"tashlast","2","2","5","6 April 2020"," Most overrated MCU movie. Not worth the praise (A critique by a die-hard Marvel Fan)
","I'm a MASSIVE Marvel fan. I've watched every single movie from Iron Man 1 up to Black Panther (At the time. Watched all the films after this) and I don't understand the praise this film got. Why? For what? A prominently black cast? Really? An all black cast and this film is credited as one of the most groundbreaking and best MCU films of all time?<br/><br/>Well you're sadly mistaken.<br/><br/>I saw Black Panther debut in the MCU for the first time in Captain America: Civil War back in 2016 alongside Spider-man, and let me tell you, the mysterious, rogue bada-- I saw in Civil War was nowhere to be seen in this movie.<br/><br/>The writing, story and consistency with past MCU movies was enraging. I saw this in theaters and I wanted to scream at the screen at times because of how contrived this entire film was. The fights and CGI? I literally wanted to die with laughter after watching the fight with Killmonger and T'Challa towards the end. It was animated like something out of a PlayStation game. Which is even more insulting to PlayStation, because their animation is way more advanced and thoughtful. Felt like it was a rushly animated the night before the premiere. The fight choreography was just bad. It wasn't memorable. In fact, that goes as saying all the fights in this movie were forgettable. I cringed every 10 minutes. The chemistry between the characters felt forced. I half blame that on the actors (Sorry Chadwick and Lupita) but mainly blame it on the writing. The romance was not there. Couldn't feel a thing for the relationship these characters had with each other.<br/><br/>I walked into this movie thinking I was gonna get a great MCU movie origin story about this character that was thoughtfully introduced in a previous film, I walked out angry thinking this was one of the most disappointing MCU movies since Iron Man 3, The Incredible Hulk, and Thor: The Dark World. They downgraded Black Panther' s character. His characerization was so boring, dull and uninspired in comparison to his character in Civil War. Such a shame. He was close to becoming a favorite.<br/><br/>I just can't believe this was the one MCU movie to get the recognition and the major awards. An Oscar Nomination for Best Picture? Are you serious? Followed by 3 other Oscars wins and a SAG. This was more like a politically driven praise more than a real constructive praise. I am now going to name all the MCU movies before Black Panther that were way better and more worthy of the awards and praise this movie got and still got bashed by critics: Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Avengers, and Captain America: Civil War. Way better films, way better acting, better action, and better plot.<br/><br/>I am a black woman and this movie was boring as hell to watch.<br/><br/>Blade was a black superhero, and he barely gets credited, yet his movies were better. I'm sorry, Blade handled it better.<br/><br/>If I ever want to rewatch all the MCU movies again just to relive the experience, I'll skip this movie alongside The Incredible Hulk and Captain Marvel.<br/><br/>Final rating 2.1/10"
"nicholls905-280-546911","7","2","5","4 March 2020"," Solid overhyped action film
","This was a well crafted Marvel film, but it didn't deserve all the hype surrounding it on release. Gifted filmmaker can't transcend the comic genre like Nolan did with The Dark Knight, Black Panther is just a good action film. I'm annoyed this was chosen over other good films for the best film Oscar. I liked the film, but it had too much hype at the time of release. Definitely at the same heights as other Marvel films."
"2004Daniel","7","2","5","21 December 2019"," Overrated and Underrated
","So many reviews here with 1 star, and the majority of them specify it's dull, dry and only rated highly because of the political reasons.<br/><br/>On the other hand, many critics have gone a bit too mad in saying it's one of the greatest movies of all time with it being the first black superhero movie etc.<br/><br/>
But overall I'd call it a solid addition to the MCU, being something a little different, and setting up Avengers: Infinity War very nicely.
The feel and atmosphere of the film was different to what we'd experienced before in the MCU, assisted nicely by a great score by Ludwig GÃ¶ransson, and originals by Kendrick Lamar.<br/><br/>One major criticism I have is the execution of the climax scene as T'Challa and Killmonger face off and Killmonger is defeated but other than that there are some fantasticly directed, one being the car chase, or perhaps the two scenes where T'Challa is challenged, specifically the Killmonger challenge.<br/><br/>And on Killmonger, he's one of my favourite villians in the MCU. Michael B. Jordan did a brilliant job there.<br/><br/>People who think it's dull are probably just watching the wrong film.
There are different genres in the MCU, for example The Winter Soldier is a Spy kind of movie, whereas Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor: Ragnarok are more like Fantasy and Comedy, and different people like different genres.<br/><br/>People who complain about it being too politicaly correct are just morons. This film (along with the entire MCU) is based on the comics, and Kevin Feige wanted to introduce Black Panther just before Avengers: Infinity War, so that the setting for Wakanda was ready to play a prominent part in the film. And for this to happen, a lot of the cast has to be black. They can't make it without the cast being black, they're basically forced to include them. So there's no way it was made just for political correctness and what not.<br/><br/>Anyway Black Panther was a very good film, and I'd probably give it a 7.7/7.8 kind of rating which rounds up to 8 for this."
"nikitalinivenko","1","2","5","10 November 2019"," Black Pander
","The early '70's gave us the Blaxploitation genre, and while most of those movies were really bad, they made up for it with attitude; those movies knew how to carry themselves (see William Marshall taking a goofy idea like Blacula and really selling it and even bringing dignity to the character). Those movies, even at their worst, had an indelible swagger. This, this is just a neutered pandering. Disney is trying to compensate for a century of dumb cartoons (Song of the South) targeted at a race with a dumb cartoon targeted at a race. The movie tries too hard without taking any chances - King T'chala is a PC Shaft for 10 year olds who don't know who Shaft is. This movie feels more patronizing than empowering. Empowering is seeing Jim Kelly in Three The Hard Way, Kung-Fu kicking the s**t out of a squad of cops in slo-mo. Here we have Americans and Englishmen doing African accents (I don't even know if they're accurate) in an idealized fantastical version of Africa where they're the most advanced because they happened to get an all-purpose element. The CGI is horrid. The premise is the ages-old half-siblings struggle over a throne. The Blaxploitation movies at least had a black authenticity to them - this is just empty weightless pixels."

Who am I to tell people not to enjoy it?"
"FeastMode","4","2","5","26 July 2019"," i'm sadly disappointed
","Very aesthetically pleasing with a GREAT cast. but overall i felt a little underwhelmed, especially with the action. and some of the parts that seem like they are fully CGI feel unreal. black panther was more bad-ass in civil war than in this movie, and that's not a good thing when he was one of like 12 superheroes in that movie with very little screen time, while starring in this one.<br/><br/>on second viewing most of my feelings are confirmed. this is a very weak movie. weak action, little semblance of story, poor dialogue, cliche moments. worst of all, it really tested my patience with the lack of excitement. i think this is the only time i've ever said that about an MCU movie. even the stan lee cameo was probably the worst in any marvel movie. the token white guy's storyline was pointless. forrest whittaker was BAD.<br/><br/>i tried one more time, gave it a third chance. i starts off well, but it spends so much time in the set up phase, only to make me wonder what the setup had anything to do with the plot. it was overly preachy, which i don't like in my movies. i more than fine with messages, but not this blatant. i fully sympathize with the message, but i don't like it in my entertainment. i was straight-up laughing at forrest whittaker's accent.<br/><br/>i know i keep going back to this, but i can't emphasize it enough. every moment that t'challa or black panther were on the screen in civil war was pure gold. i immediately fell in love with black panther. i didn't know he was in the movie, didn't know t'challa was a superhero, liked the actor right away. and it was all so perfect. all his fight scenes were amazing. his beastliness immediately rivaled the rest of the MCU crew. the post credit scene got me SO excited for this movie. it should have been really easy to please me. the fact that they didn't saddens me (3 viewings, 5/8/2020)<br/><br/>
SPOILERS<br/><br/>
for someone named killmonger, he really likes throwing ppl rather than dealing a fatal blow. the fake death of t'challa was so lame. why is there air craft battles in this? you know i love me some jet fights but it really wasn't necessary in this movie and didn't feel like it belonged. felt like hey it's an mcu movie we need flight battles.<br/><br/>i really didn't understand the story line, i would love for someone to explain it to me. killmonger shows up in wakanda like 45 minutes into the movie. i was trying to understand why the stuff before it lead us here. he stole the vibranium ax for klau, klau tried to sell it to the cia, got caught, killmonger broke him out, killed him, and then went to wakanda. what? the only thing i could think of is that he needed klau to gain an audience, but then why didn't he kill him from the start? why steal the ax? stuff just kind of happened cause the story said so, didn't have a natural flow.<br/><br/>and so many moments were so obvious, like his sister saying ""there is no way he can beat t'challa"" = t'challa is gonna lose. mbaka saying we will not help = we will come in at the last second to have a dramatic entrance. the entire last action sequence did very little for me. not a fan of his new explosive ability, i really loved that he's basically a ninja, no need for all that extra stuff. does cap need a bunch of fancy colorful weapons? no. neither does black panther. similar to how i felt about spider-man's suit"
"jchm-21143","4","2","5","17 June 2019"," A worthy political point doesn't mean a movie isn't going to be mediocre
","And thats what this film is.<br/><br/>Yes its great that the main actors are black (although as its set in central Africa what else would they be???).
But in reality it s a very average film. There is nothing particularly oustanding about the movie. The set design is very good (in particular the ""techno-organic"" archirecture of Wakanda.) But the storyline is very average - and even sub-standard in places.
The battle scenes in particular are somewhat absurd and unbelieveable - looking more like a mass brawl than any military operation. I suspect whoever wrote it knows very little about armed conflict or military history.
Also the the villains are very disappointing. Klaw is probably the best bad guy the MCU has come up with. However, he is dispensed with early on to make way fort just another baddie clone of the hero. Same as happened in Ant-Man, Thor, Winter Soldier, Iron Man... in fact just about every other Marvel film. A major opportunity lost.
Anyway... it's okay - just. But just that and nothing more."

"isaacj02","8","2","5","29 December 2018"," Subverting expectations; Coogler takes on Marvel's most exciting story yet
","Few predicted the level to which Marvel's Black Panther would become a cultural phenomenon. Director Ryan Coogler's addition to the MCU received acclaim from critics and audiences alike, as well as breaking an impressive $1 billion at the worldwide box office. Perhaps key to the success of Black Panther is the way that it thrills both fans of the superhero flick but also transcends the usual bounds of the genre, in its characters, design and themes. This is a film that subverts the typical Marvel formula, something which is long overdue.
Chadwick Boseman comfortably leads the film as the eponymous hero, venerable monarch by day and suit-sporting vigilante by night. T'Challa rules the nation of Wakanda, a futuristic and technologically advanced utopia shielded by a mask as a third-world nation. T'Challa's ex-lover, Nakia (played on expected brilliant form by Lupita Nyong'o) fights the case for Wakanda's moral duty to share the truth of their wealth; this is one of many surprisingly complex questions which weave their way satisfyingly into the narrative. Taking this even further is the film's villain, Erik Killmonger, a Wakandan isolated from the kingdom, calling for a revolution by black people against their oppressors. Michael B. Jordan is a charismatic villain, wonderful shades of humanity embedded within his performance, providing a fitting and scarily relatable foe for the Black Panther. A spunky ensemble (though prone to spouting exposition) completes the mix, Letitia Wright's Shuri acting as the Q to T'Challa's Bond and Martin Freeman delightfully Watson-esque as an obliging CIA agent.
For the most part, Black Panther is a stunning movie to witness, embracing its Afro-futurism with a colourful and vibrant design. The film feels very much buried in its cultural roots, which gives some understanding to the film's significance. Ludwig Goransson provides a luscious and innovative score and rap numbers courtesy of Kendrick Lamar complement the action.
The action sequences in the movie are also riveting; ""I never freeze"" pronounces T'Challa coolly in an early scene... and neither does the film itself. Pace never lags in relentless and sharp action sequences, gripping the audiences to their seats and, at some points, providing a strong emotional pay-off. The final act is certainly where the film is at its most disappointing, descending into an increasingly loud and banal CGI-fest, which, whilst not uncommon in a Marvel flick, is certainly beneath the calibre of Black Panther. Visual effects are also dodgy at certain instances, oddly plasticky and unfinished-looking. For the most part, however, Black Panther delivers soundly for popcorn moviegoers, never allowing its themes and cultural statements to overtake the pure entertainment.
One only has to see Black Panther to understand the reasons behind its sensation and the whisper of Oscars floating around. Ryan Coogler has crafted a visually staggering blockbuster, which manages to tell an engrossing story, with plenty of popcorn thrills, yet also a remarkably deep cultural message that boasts great relevance. Black Panther is without a doubt one of the most exciting and inventive Marvel outings yet."

"Sci-FiHorrorFan","5","2","5","15 November 2018"," This movie is very overrated.
","I'm sorry but black panther is a boring movie that had a very uninteresting plot, and this is coming from me who is a mixed raced man. To make a long story short, just because I don't like the movie that does not make me a racist, which is what most people tend to say to the people who don't like the movie. Well, I'm sorry guys but you're wrong. The people who don't like this movie have MANY REASONS why they don't like it and NONE of those reasons are to do with race. I personally didn't like the movie because I thought it was boring as hell! It was so boring in fact that I had a hard time understanding why most people like this movie more than Age of Ultron!<br/><br/>Can someone explain to me why this movie is better than Age of Ultron??? It's NOT BETTER IT'S WORSE. Age of Ultron is a Great Movie! And it is Action packed from start to finish!. The Action in that movie is insanely entertaining! And my eyes were glued to the screen the whole time. The story was entertaining, the characters were great, and in my opinion, Ultron was great! Yes, I said it, Ultron is a Great Villain. I honestly would put Thanos in first place and Ultron in second place and then Loki in third place when it comes to best villains. Yes I know I have probably made people angry by saying that but it's my opinion and I won't change it. Those three are the top Marvel Villains in my opinion and they would all kick killmongers Ass Easily. Yes, I am also one of the few people who thinks the Killmonger Villain is overrated. Killmonger is one of the biggest problems I have with the black panther movie, the guy was all talk and no action. Do the people who like this guy not realize that?<br/><br/>This guy wins one fight and he thinks he's king of the WORLD! Give me a break!!! What's so impressive about that???
Ultron could kill this guy in five seconds!!. Also, Ultron nearly destroyed The WORLD! I think that fact alone makes him a better villain than killmonger!. I will be very surprised if anyone agrees with me on that. They probably won't because they know The truth hurts.<br/><br/>The fight black panther has with killmonger was nothing special either, it was okay at best, but black panther got beaten way too easy in my opinion. Also, this is supposed to be a movie about black panther and black panther doesn't even do that much in his own movie! Which is weird considering the title of the movie is Black Panther!.<br/><br/>And don't get me started on Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue! He was even more Lame than killmonger was!. His acting was over the top and ridiculous! And he spent The whole movie acting like he was high on Crack!. When the man started singing I face-palmed myself because of the Stupidity I was watching and hearing!. He is definitely one of the worst marvel villains ever!. Ultron already kicked his ass once! And then black panther kicks his ass again! Easily.<br/><br/>If anyone is reading this review they are probably very mad at me by this point which doesn't surprise me either. I'm sorry folks but I have to be honest, and I honestly think this is an overrated movie!. The things most people find impressive about it I don't find impressive at all. 1 The story. What story?? The movie barely has a story!. 2 The bad guy killmonger being one of the best villains. I disagree with that %100 He is actually one of the WORST Marvel villains as well as one of the most generic villains ever!. There is simply nothing special or scary about him and he has no substance. I found him to be a run of the mill villain. Loki would destroy this wannabe in a fight Easily. I'm sorry but I don't see how I can be wrong about that, and furthermore, I'm not the only person who likes Loki, a lot of people like Loki and I'm sure they would agree with me about Loki kicking his ass.<br/><br/>Now getting to number 3. People say the villain is sympathetic. I'm sorry but I disagree once again. I don't understand why most people are showing sympathy for a man who wanted to commit genocide!!!. He nearly strangled a woman to death! And he spoke about wanting to rule the world! Even if that meant killing innocent women and children!!!. So how is this man sympathetic??? HE'S NOT!. Killmonger was a psycho! Who was way too cocky for his own good, and it was his cockiness that made him lose the fight at the end of the movie. The only time I felt slightly bad for him is when he spoke about how his dad was killed in the past. Yes that IS sad I will admit that, BUT That doesn't justify GENOCIDE!!!. It's not the world's fault your dad was killed, it was black panthers dad who killed him, but since he's dead, I guess the only people he can be angry with are black panther and his tribe. But once again, being angry at black panther is one thing but wanting to commit GENOCIDE IS ANOTHER!!!. I should also point out Black panthers dad only killed killmongers dad in (self-defence) because he tried to kill black panthers uncle, so by law, the killing was justified. Even though killing was justified I can totally understand why killmonger would be sad about THAT. However, wanting to rule the WORLD because of it is totally RIDICULOUS!. Sigh, and people call Ultron Lame!?? Ultron is NOT lame, Killmonger is Lame!. Killmonger had a totally dumb reason for wanting to rule the world and he was a lame villain because of it.
I did not feel any sympathy for killmonger %95 of the time. The movie wants us to feel bad for him but most of the time I didn't. I'm sorry but when you threaten to kill thousands of people, my sympathy for you goes out the window.<br/><br/>The ending fight between black panther and killmonger was terrible too. The fight was lame and badly edited with terrible special effects! I felt like I was watching two guys fighting inside a video game! And it looked Awful. That fight was very disappointing and I expected a lot more from it considering it was the final fight!. Black Panther also got his ass kicked a second time, and he only won the end fight because he was able to grab a knife and stab killmonger, and even that was done in a very lame and unsatisfying way. Then he shows sympathy to the bad guy after he stabs him just because they are cousins!?. He did not deserve any sympathy in my opinion, not after all the people he killed, and everything else he did! Not to mention the fact that he tried to kill black panther too!<br/><br/>There are many other things people praise this movie for too like it being the first ever black superhero movie. Sorry folks but Blade beat you to it!. Wesley Snipes is Black and his blade movies are better than this movie. Another movie that has a black lead that is the hero of the movie is Predator 2. Danny Glover kicked more ass in predator 2 then black panther did in this movie! And that movie is nearly thirty years old!! And it's a better movie than this movie!!. You also have pitch black and the chronicles of Riddick and Event Horizon, those movies are all better than black panther. They may not be superhero movies but they all have mixed raced and black people as the main characters. I love those movies and I love those characters. I like those characters more than black panther, and they all kicked more ass than black panther did too.<br/><br/>Black Panther is a movie that just has problem after problem after problem. I've seen black panther twice now, and after seeing it the second time around it has Not held up well, in fact, I found it way worse the second time around and even more boring the second time around. The only things I liked about this movie were a few fights, a few okay effects and two of the female characters. I liked black panthers sister Cherry I thought she was likeable and funny and I liked the bald lady Okoye. I thought she was cool and the most badass person in the whole movie! (Don't attack me I'm not a feminist, I just happened to like her) She actually fights very well, and I enjoyed her fight scenes in the club and I liked the few fights she had at the end of the movie with cherry helping her. Cherry fights pretty good too.<br/><br/>Sadly that's where the positives End because I can't think of anything else I liked in the movie. The acting is not the problem with this movie, the acting was okay from everyone except Andy Serkis, he sucked. The directing was bad and the writing was terrible. The movie was way too slow and did not have enough action. The movie had a script that lacked action, thrills, originality and good storytelling and overall the movie just ended up being an Average cliched and forgettable run of the mill movie.<br/><br/>I definitely don't recommend it."

","Lots of action, but a lack of any serious depth to the plot. It's actually a simplistic plot. It's somewhat ironic that Wakanda is presented as the most advanced culture on Earth. But this ""advanced"" culture chooses its leader by ritual combat to the the death. That's hardly advanced or civilized. Such a nation would have inevitably descended into tyranny and war if their leaders were chosen this way. And that is what happens in the movie. There was such a tremendous amount of hype to this movie- perhaps more hype than for any movie before in history. The movie doesn't live up to the hype. Not even close. The CGI wasn't even that good. Some of the gushing reviews by ""professional"" critics were unbelievable. Were we watching the same movie? It's as if they felt obligated to love the movie because a lot of black people were in it. Over-all this is a movie that will enthrall children and people with the minds of children. Intelligent adults won't think that much of it. Many of them will lose track of what is happening fairly quickly. And not really care. After all, it's eye candy for the kids. So who cares if it lacks a serious plot?"

","What a disappointment this was. The story was bizarre and the acting terrible to begin with. The attempt to mix a disney like lion king story with aliens was a bit odd but it's part of the marvel universe so I guess it's not a big surprise. But trying to also include some sort of more serious racial inequality message in the same movie was out of place and more than a bit hypocritical - it seemed like all of the main characters were American or British so it didn't exactly promote Africans, even though the story was about an African people. Just a weird movie all around."
"zayaansallie-94341","10","2","5","13 June 2018"," A beautifully crafted work of African excellence.
","I have seen a lot of negative reviews on here about this movie being ""over-hyped"". I would like to try and explain, to what I assume is majority white male reviewers, why this movie was so successful.<br/><br/>To start with the negatives: Yes, there were a few cringey, stereotypical, MCU moments but these are found in all superhero movies and are part of the reason we (well, I) love them. <br/><br/>Now... as to why this movie is an absolutely brilliant piece of film.<br/><br/>Ryan Coogler directed this movie brilliantly. From simple things like the choice of camera angles to the comedic timing to the final scene with T'Challa and Kilmonger, the breathtaking scenes, stunning landscapes and well shot scenes created an easy-to-watch, fluid, well-conducted movie. <br/><br/>I have seen many comments about the acting being ""boring"". Personally, I wasn't bored at all during the movie and I will explain more later but for now, the acting. Chadwick Boseman portrays a serious, somewhat brooding king who carries the weight of a nation on his shoulders. I found his portrayal a nod to many great African leaders who have shown power through outward tranquility, despite inner turmoil. He is patient, thoughtful and an intellectual yet he can still beat the crap out of anyone. 
Danai Gurira represents female, African power and is an amazing supporting actress. I don't think that many people understand the importance of the scene where her husband bows down to her. It's so empowering to see that, especially since Okoye is a true African Warrior. 
Letitia Wright's performance as Shuri was shockingly wonderful. Her comedic relief - a key trait of the MCU - was readily welcome. Seeing a super genius, who is a woman, and possibly smarter than Tony Stark is amazing. <br/><br/>I cannot get started on Killmonger without feeling a million feelings and wanted to scream and burst into tears at the same time. I think that many people missed the point of the 3D nature of this villain. Superhero movies are generally not made to make you philosophise or think deeply about life. However, thanks to Killmonger, a whole new vision and way of thinking is introduced into the Wakandan world. <br/><br/>Killmonger, in the movie, represents the idea of empowering other black people around the world using Wakandan technology. Although, T'Challa's father used to insist on protecting Wakanda from outsiders and keeping it a secret. Even though Killmonger is the ""bad guy"", he influences T'Challa's final decision to share Wakandan technology with the world. If you miss the significance of this then it is probably because you don't live in Africa or anywhere that has been oppressed by colonial powers. <br/><br/>Killmonger represents the feelings, the emotions, the hate, the turmoil that Africans feel towards colonial rule, white supremacy and the oppression that they are subjected to every single day. <br/><br/>At the end, we can't hate Killmonger because what he is saying is true. T'Challa even says that he doesn't need to die. <br/><br/>This scene... between T'Challa and Killmonger is something that incites such strong feelings of power and insight that I can't believe people have completely ignored it. Killmonger says ""Bury me in the ocean with my ancestors that jumped from the ships because they knew death was better than bondage..."" 
Killmonger refuses to be enslaved in a world where he is constantly oppressed because of the colour of his skin, where he comes from and his violent ideas due to this oppression. It is something that I am sure many African Americans can relate to and something that I, as an African relate to deeply. <br/><br/>Besides the plot line, many other things made this film significant for me. It wasn't just a ""let's throw a couple of black people together and call it diversity!"" type of movie. The entire cast and crew put in SO much effort to create an inclusive movie. <br/><br/>Most people won't notice how deeepppp they went to create this movie because they aren't African. Now, I'm from South Africa and there was A LOT of focus on South African culture. I also noticed some Ghananian and Nigerian culture creeping in but, of course, I couldn't pick up on all of it because I don't come from these countries. <br/><br/>Firstly, the fact that they spoke Xhosa many times throughout the movie was astounding. Xhosa is not a very easy language for non-home language speakers. Although it was not 100%... only South Africans would have picked up on that. <br/><br/>But also, there were many, many, many jokes which only South Africans would have understood/laughed at. I think that this is great because the cinema is lively and bubbling whilst watching the film, due to excitement at great jokes and the adorable nods to SA culture. <br/><br/>The music was great. I could hear Ngobisiqolo playing in the background of one of the scenes... also Babes Wodumo and I was jamming in the cinema. It is great how they included actual African cultures and traditions to create a true African Wakanda rather than a fully Afro-American version. <br/><br/>I throughly enjoyed the movie due to its strong themes of overcoming racial issues, fighting the powers that be and its dutiful nods to African culture. <br/><br/>Many white men will not understand its significance but I thought that, surely, they will understand the plot line and the amazing creation of Killmonger who is probably one of my favourite villains in the MCU. A true villain is a human inside. They make you love them and hate them. They make you sad when they die. Killmonger did all these things. <br/><br/>It really was, in many ways, a story of empowering black people - African or American -, empowering women and exposing people to the philosophy of the anger and hate that exists within Africans against colonisers and in favour of the brotherhood. <br/><br/>I urge you to watch the movie again and look for plot lines that move you because there were so many symbols, themes and ideas that I left out in this review that I found in Black Panther. A brilliant movie, perfectly crafted for the African."

He's not just evil for some silly reason, and in the end he isn't simply defeated. This complexity is something most superhero movies lack, and some excellent acting all round really makes this a fun and thought provoking movie.<br/><br/>The visuals are excellent. Marvel seems to have listened to complaints about other movies looking a little flat and dull and really fixed those problems here.<br/><br/>Black Panther is the stand out movie in the Marvel cinematic universe.

"s3276169","5","2","5","28 May 2018"," Action man meets the Lion King.....
","I'm really not a big fan of Marvels cartoonie flicks, so call me biased. That said, that bias had to come from somewhere and for me, its the general inanity and blandness of these kinds of films that is so off putting. <br/><br/>Black Panther feels a lot like Action Man meets The Lion King. Its got a kind of unreal, simplistic , garishly optimistic feel to it, that is, I suspect, simply unconvincing for anyone over 14 years of age. <br/><br/>The story is the usual basic adventure/action fare that's fraught with contradiction. Why an advanced society would embrace a medieval feudalistic model of rule based on a King makes little sense. Nor does the notion of it being hidden from the world behind a rather contrived force field. I'm sure none of the not so lucky locals, forced to live in simple huts, would be tempted to tell the world for some extra $$?<br/><br/>The narrative is predictable. Comprised of shallow, basic dialogue and bland humour, designed to make the character's seem mildly believable.<br/><br/>Really the action is the only place where this film shines. That, of course, is to be expected but is there any harm in injecting a little intelligence into the overall story rather than dumbing the thing down to the point where it could only really appeal to early teens?<br/><br/>So whats left to say? Watchable on a very superficial level but really that is it. More one for the young than cynical worldly wise, old guys, like myself. 5/10 from me."
"rutzelb","9","2","5","16 May 2018"," Delivers as Promised
","T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns as King to his homeland Wakanda. Wakanda is considered a third world country isolated from the rest of the world, but due to a meteorite that landed in Wakanda that contained Vibranium, the hardest metal in the Universe, the people were able to advance in technology and do not want to share their technology with the rest of the world for fear the Vibranium would be weaponized and constant wars would result. When T'Challa drinks a special herb affected by the Vibranium he gains superhuman powers and is known as the Black Panther. <br/><br/>Okay, that's only half of the story that you need. The next half is that M'Baku (Winston Duke) challenges King T'Challa and beats him in a King's Challenge and throws him over the waterfall and all believe T'Challa is dead; M'Baku wants to sell Vibranium to all countries to help the downtrodden peoples of the world have a chance at a better life and not caring about the consequences of wars among the countries.
 
So these are the 2-issues you need to focus on. There are some other issues, but you only need these two main ones. Oh, Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) T'Challa's love interest wants Wakanda to share its technology with the rest of the world. T'Challa isn't too keen on this. <br/><br/>The Hype this movie received is well worth all the publicity. The sets are outstanding, the fight scenes and plane battles are expertly choreographed as much CGI is incorporated. The acting all around is spot on. No doubt about it, this movie delivers. <br/><br/>The only thing I had trouble with were the darkened scenes in the beginning. Then later at the end we see the fight between the NOW Two Kings and Black Panthers: T'Challa and M'Baku at the end as those scenes were very dark taking place in an underground railroad of sorts. <br/><br/>Normally, in a movie like this there is some humor and here there is only one instance. When T'Challa's mother asks for help from another regional King to help defeat new King M'Baku, he gets annoyed and says he will feed these people to his children. Then he laughs and says, ""No that is not true as we are Vegans"" and he continues to laugh at his own joke. <br/><br/>Notables: Forest Whitaker as Zuri; Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue; Martin freeman as Everett K. Ross, a CIA agent.<br/><br/>Stan Lee makes an appearance at a casino craps table. He is now probably busy writing a sequel.<br/><br/>There is very good heart stomping music throughout. <br/><br/>The hype was good and the movie delivered and now we wait for the sequels. (9/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Humor: Brief. Language: Brief soft stuff.

"beckstrinker","4","2","5","14 May 2018"," Just alright
","Black panther tells the story of how a man whos name I can neither pronounce nor write becomes king of Wakanda, a fictional African super tech culture. Over the course of about 2 and a half hours the movie really only tells exactly that story. Yes he has to face an evil villain as part of the journey and fight some evil bad guys and all the other standard superhero stuff. But nothing really excites in this movie. His powers are kinda average and meh, the story kinda drags and is pretty meh, the fake dialect is meh and the only thing the characters have going for them is the fact that they are pretty much all black - which to be honest doesn't bother me, but its also not an great argument to like a movie simply because of the casts skin color - but apart from that they are also pretty meh. I did not care one bit for the bad guy. Only interesting character is one of badies played by Andi Serkis.
Black panther was by no means horrible. It had its moments, it has some cool scenes and nice visuals but that is basically it. Nothing is really inspiring, no scene breathtaking and towards the end the movie really starts to drag. Overall, black panther is probably my least favorite of the resent marvel movies. If you want a movie to watch while cooking or cleaning, this is a perfect choice!"
"lesleyharris30","8","2","5","10 May 2018"," Provides a Thrilling New Layer to the MCU,
","Black Panther is a great movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. The spectacle of this film is absolutely breathtaking, the whole world of Wakanda is established well by director Ryan Coogler. We are utterly convinced that this a real society, with a clear sense of community conveyed, as well as concise character's. <br/><br/>I will admit that I was a little let down as a result of all the hype surrounding it, it did not manage to live up to my expectations. While it does nail the action and intensity, the humour, something that Marvel usually masters, was very mediocre for me. There is several cringey moments that were trying too hard to be funny when these characters simply are not humourus, I would have been fine with the film taking itself completely seriously. <br/><br/>The cast are all around terrific, the standouts being Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa, who nails it and lives up to his terrific set up in Civil War, and Michael B. Jordan, who play's one of Marvel's greatest villains yet as Killmonger. The sibling rivalry-type relationship between these two characters created a relationship that was thrilling to watch. Other cast members, such as Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis, among many others, all shine in their parts, all having individually brilliant moments. The film also deserves credit as being the first big budget blockbuster to feature a largely African-American cast, it is a huge steppingstone for film and I hope others follow what Marvel has set. <br/><br/>Action packed and original. Intense, well acted and featuring a slew of great characters, I would recommend Black Panther to anyone looking for a good action or adventure.<br/><br/>
A forner victim of Black Panther's father puts his nation under threat. <br/><br/>

","I absolutely loved this movie and I can't agree with anything that the haters say. It's a combination of a few things - that's why it's so amazing. It has a decent story that is properly developed (unlike a lot of action movies that focus on effects only), the effects are mind-blowing, the outfits are beautiful, the sets are stunning, and I loved the acting. Why are people saying the acting was terrible? I actually LOVED how authentic the actors played, better than many white actors. And the accents are a great addition to it. Oh, and let's not forget the humor. There were a lot of effortless funny lines.
I couldn't find anything wrong with this movie if I tried. Brilliantly executed, fun, magical and at the same time real. Great filmmaking that everyone can enjoy, not just black people.

"jpachar82","10","2","5","2 May 2018"," A Black Cat Prowls
","Created by Marvel creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in July of 1966, Black Panther was born in the Silver Age of Comic Book history becoming the first African American Marvel Superhero. With the creation of Black Panther, the black cat became a huge phenomenon in comic history that it made a feature film in 2018, with an unknown person playing the title roll by the name of Chadwick Boseman. 
 In the furriest of details, this movie has gained such momentum in the box office that it literally broke the box office within the first weekend. But let's get back to Wakanda. The birth place of the black prowler. We first met T'Challa, Black Panther, in Captain America: Civil War, when the Cap and Iron Man were on opposite sides of the government spectrum dueling for the survival of the Avengers. 
 Now we come to Wakanda and history of the way T'Challa became the prowler known as Black Panther. Now, I'm not going to sit here and spill out any details, but I will have to say that this movie has out beat all the other Marvel movies by far and to date. 
 I know that, without a shadow of a doubt, literally the shadows, that this movie will continue to go down in comic book history as the greatest superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, all thanks to the director Ryan Coogler. As Kendrick Lamar swiftly puts it in the title track for the movie, ""This may be the night that my dreams might let me know. All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you. This may be the night that my dreams might let me know. All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer."""

"timothyalanwilliams","9","2","5","29 April 2018"," Wakanda Forever!
","After two comedy-heavy entries in its cinematic universe, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" and ""Thor: Ragnarok"", Marvel has finally come back to its senses with ""Black Panther"". Under the very capable hands of writer/director Ryan Coogler (who breathed life back into the Rocky franchise with ""Creed""), along with an all-star African-American cast, ""Black Panther"" brings a fresh approach to the comic book/superhero genre. 
Chadwick Boseman returns as newly-appointed King T'Challa after his breakout role in ""Captain America: Civil War"". He is joined by Danai Gurira (""The Waking Dead"") as his army general, Okoye; Lupita Nyong'o (""12 Years A Slave"") his ex-girlfriend and wanted spy; Daniel Kaluuya (""Get Out"") his close friend and Okoye's lover; as well as scene-steeling newcomer Letitia Wright as his tech-savvy sister, Shuri. Add in Forrest Whittaker (""Rogue One"") Angela Bassett (""9-1-1""), Michael B. Jordan (""Creed""), Sterling K. Brown (""This Is Us""), Andy Serkis (""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) and Martin Freeman (""The Hobbit"" trilogy) and you have enough star power to energize a major city. But star power alone is not what carries this movie. It is the well-balanced story and grounded tone that makes it feel more like a Bond movie with hints of ""The Lion King"" and ""Game of Thrones"". 
What impressed me the most is the cultural relevance throughout the movie. The action scenes are good (although I prefer the action sequences in the Russo Brothers' ""Captain America"" films), the tech/gadgets are cool, and the humor is nicely placed to keep it light. But best moments are in Wakanda, where the African scenery, fashion, and culture are on full display. 
Kudos to Marvel for placing ""Black Panther"" into the right hands and kudos to the actors who felt the weight of each role and delivered on all counts. 
The only things that could have been improved were the action scenes (primarily hand to hand combat scenes), some sketchy CGI moments, and a rather sluggish first act. But none of those minor criticisms should deter you from seeing and enjoying this next chapter in the Marvel saga. Wakanda forever!"

","First off, as a superhero movie, an action movie, a mass entertainment, it works like gangbusters. It is fun, never feels boring, is consistently surprising and inventive in its action sequences and introduces a lot of really cool stuff throughout the movie. But the reason that this movie is going to be so important, why it has become a cultural milestone before it ever was released is where this movie really shines. Ryan Coogler could have been buried under the weight of the expectations of making the first true big-budget superhero movie lead by an almost all black cast, but instead he made a movie that embraces and subverts those expectations and he has delivered an absolute triumph that celebrates the fact that it is an African movie, set 95% in Africa, with 99% African characters. It embraces the traditions, the culture, it does not apologize for its blackness because it is organic to who the characters are. The female characters in this movie are equals to the male characters in combat or even often superior, superior in intelligence, funny, independent and just alive in a way that most movies, but especially superhero movies, rarely allow them to be. And the villain, wow, Killmonger is a true villain, but he is one of the greats because his motivations are understandable, his motivations even make sense, but his solution to a real problem is where he is wrong. The final scene between Black Panther and Killmonger is brilliant, truly. This is clearly just the beginning for these characters, as all of Wakanda looks to play a major part in Infinity War and I for one can barely wait to see it, but in the meantime I plan to return to Wakanda at least once more."

They also portrayed strong female characters, which I think was great. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the jokes they had in the movie felt so out of place and they were too cringey. I feel like the jokes might have been more acceptable if the movie was comedy, or if the storyline and characters weren't too serious. The jokes just felt out of context and irrelavent.<br/><br/>I feel like if the movie was from the villain's perspective, it would be more interesting because then you would see how he discovered more about his father and how he came about to be this ""villain"". I honestly believe that his perspective wouldn't be boring like the king's perspective. <br/><br/>I also hated how they made one of the kidnappers say ""wallahi I will kill you"" as this portrays Muslims negatively like most media sources nowadays.

","So i had read a lot of positive things about this movie from professional, and a mixture of negative, and not so positive remarks from others. So I decided to forget all that, when i went to see the movie.
I believe the critics were right. This is a wonderful movie. it.s totally deserving of 
every bit of praise it gets. It looks terrific. Top marks to costume and production design. it has good acting. although let's be honest, Andy Serkis steals the movie. But i suppose, anyone who gives as loud a performmance, as he does was going to be noticed. But as brought up when introducing the main villains, it's not the first time, whites have stolen from blacks. i also liked that the movie wasn't afraid to have some quiet moments of people just talking. Yes, there some cheesy moments. See challenge number one, and scene after some of the end credits. But overall, wonderful."

"piotrkubiak","Null","2","5","25 February 2018"," Beautiful, stunning and sexy movie with complex and fascinating characters
","I was a little skeptical hearing such great reviews. I didn't have any expectations going to see this movie. 
The film turned out to be great. Stunning visually, sexy and with complex relevant themes. There were some beautiful cultural references in costumes, traditions etc. All characters are fascinating and versatile. While not all the characters are portrayed as comics intended all the characters apart from one - M'Baku were played exceptionally.
But my main praise goes to outstanding black female characters in the movie and actresses portraying them! Not only do they outshine male counterparts they outshine Wonder Woman movie character thousandfold. In my opinion that is. Many great characters but my favorite are Okoye and Killmonger. Well done Marvel!<br/><br/>I am hoping that this film will help to invigorate and expand a little stagnant, narrow and outdated range of white-mostly movies and boring and narrow-minded characterizations through clichés and stereotyping to create more culturally varied characters and movies."
"averagejak","7","2","5","22 February 2018"," A strong entry for marvel, which almost lives up to the hype
","Prior to seeing BP, I read a lot about the movie and how great it was, a game changer, an event. I didn't think the movie could live up to this hype and felt a lot of the sentiment was probably down to what the movie signifies and stands for, rather than the quality of the movie itself.<br/><br/>I was right I feel, but only just. The movie has a fairly straightforward solid plot. Its characters are quite well rounded. Its visuals are quite beautiful. But for each of these positives there is a negative underneath the surface,<br/><br/>The plot itself is pretty light. there really isnt too much to it. And I think for a complicated villain- which is what they were trying to create, the plot, his motivations and more importantly the way he planned to execute those motivations was too simple.<br/><br/>The well rounded characters are just too many really. You cant in a 2 hour movie really get to grips with 10 characters, who are all largely new to you. At times Boseman seemed on point- at other times, it just seemed that his deep contemplation had nothing behind it. Having a slightly longer run time- they could have used more time for a couple of moments of personal reflection. Or one or two more moments where Tchalla and Killmonger spoke alone.. to talk as intelligent people, with a mutual understanding and awareness. we got this, at the end. But for me it seemed to hard a shift. from the aggression of killmonger and the unwillingness of t'challa to really try to avoid the fight.. to now a moment of sympathy and empathy. i wanted to spend more time with killmonger, when was just him.. not giving orders, not forwarding the plan or plot. the supporting cast could have also had more time, but thats a more minor point.<br/><br/>finally the visuals in terms of landscapes were beautiful. The country of wakanda which they created, was this amazing mix of tech and earth.. but the moment there were any fight scenes, you got the same shaky cam, too close, too blurred rubbish which is very popular in movies these days. The fact that the hero and villain are both cgi only made the action look more fake, and harder to make out.. in a way it reminded me of transformers and the awful fight rendering. you just dont feel there is actual weight/gravity.. it all looks quite doll like.<br/><br/>The above being addressed, would have made this one of the great movies.. As it is, it is one of the great comic book movies."
"manubhatt3","7","2","5","22 February 2018"," The only thing awesome in this movie, is the end credits video song.
","I liked Black Panther in the Civil War and was excited about this movie. I hoped to see some amazing adventure and action by Black Panther in this movie but what I got was a family power struggle for the throne of a kingdom/country. <br/><br/>Many action scenes and a big part of the storyline doesn't even involve the Black Panther with all his powers and abilities. That was a bit disappointing. At the end, I remained thirsty for some Black Panther action involving his powers and abilities. <br/><br/>The movie is good in what it's trying to show but I disliked the acting by the mostly Black cast in this movie. That doesn't mean I don't like Black actors; I have admired many times acting by Black actors/actresses. I don't know. Even Daniel Kaluuya whom I liked and appreciated so much in Get Out, seemed like a novice actor in this movie.<br/><br/>The end credit video song is awesome in my view and it's worth purchasing the whole movie ticket for. I am not talking about just the song but also the picturization and the way it's perfectly fits and harmonizes with the whole movie."
"Arlonz_k","7","2","5","22 February 2018"," Standard origin story but a little try-hard in some places
","Reviewed it on Rotten Tomatoes but, strangely, it doesn't show up there...so here I am.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>I thought I'd write this review having just gotten home from seeing the movie so it would be fresh in my mind. <br/><br/>Overall, it's on par with all the other origin stories we've seen thus far and gives us a greater insight into T'Challa and how he's come to be who he is. So as Tony Stark was the billionaire playboy that had to see his life's work used to harm others and be a victim of the same before he comes around, we see T'Challa has led a life in which he was groomed from childhood to eventually rule his nation with self-sacrifice always being a possibility. <br/><br/>Now, let's be blunt here. Given all of the absolutely asinine nonsense that was swirling about before the movie came out, the real concern was how the issues of an ethnostate and nationalism would play out on the big screen, especially because we're aware of some of the personal beliefs held by Disney execs, directors and the like. <br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were dealt with rather fairly and honestly. Maybe someone was watching how Star Wars: The Last Jedi was being handled and took notes on how NOT to destroy a good story by poisoning it with their personal views. That being said, they didn't go too far in the opposite direction and completely ignore that there are people in THIS world that have radical views, though they could have gone just a little further in the explanation of why they were wrong. <br/><br/>Case in point, Killmonger openly states that other black people around the globe suffer and lays the blame squarely on the shoulders of those he doesn't speak of directly(that I can recall) i.e. white people. Anyone that knows even a smattering of history will understand that there have been black people that suffered at the hands of whites...but also at the hands of other blacks that sold their countryman into slavery themselves(unpleasant fact that not all slavers were simply grabbed and whisked away), poor decisions and even the simple lack of resources in their surroundings in which to take advantage of to better themselves. Though T'Challa disagrees with Warmonger's actions to take the world over with Wakanda(and presumably, based on his actions and speech, blacks around the world having a privileged position) being the ruling nation above all, the message that he was wrong would have carried far more weight if human greed, which is found in every race, was acknowledged as the driving force behind much of the world's suffering.<br/><br/>There was a joke with his sister calling the C.I.A. agent 'colonizer' but it fell flat as such because, again, it felt a little too much like they may have tried to be cute to get away with insinuating that only one race has ever expanded beyond it's borders of origin. And a lone ""white-boy"" as well but it seems in line with the intelligent, but immature, character.<br/><br/>There was another slight jab about not building barriers at the end which was almost certainly a shot across the bow at America's southern border and the desire of many to prevent others from crossing illegally. In the Marvel universe it's hinted that Wakanda would use it's technology to help the world, and in the last shot shows that the first outreach center would be located in America to help those in need. It's a nice thought but sadly, we live in the real world where resources are more limited with the impact of fewer jobs, greater social welfare expenditure, likely crime because of not being able to determine the character(which is based on previous actions, in this case criminal) of those who enter the country or not is felt by the people not living in 'ivory towers'. It was too 'clean' of a message that those who need/want help should receive it regardless of the ramifications to the country meant to give it. <br/><br/>Another memerable point was when T'Challa says that he can't speak for past kings and their actions. Although I question whether most will be able to understand the meaning of that it has to be pointed out as being a good point. Blaming those in the present for the happenings of the past is foolish at best and absurdly dangerous at worst. No group is without sins and all that can be done is to grow and make sure we don't repeat them in the future. <br/><br/>The last point that resonated with me was when Killmonger referenced how some slaves would throw themselves overboard rather than live out their lives in misery and pain and said that death was better than bondage. This was the same reason America had it's Revolution. ""Give me freedom or give me death.""- Patrick Henry. Freedom is something never guaranteed and as Ronald Reagan said, ""Freedom is a fragile thing and is never more than one generation away from extinction."" We see our individual freedoms slowly encroached upon until one day, we'll have them in name only. And even the divisiveness that is sown into society by media, power-hungry politicians and other forces with darker intent is a bondage of a type if we look to see how it prevents us from growing.<br/><br/>
Of course, how the movie will be viewed is ultimately up to the individual and their experiences and their desire to be honest about all the problems that were presented in the movie. Some will see it and identify with Warmonger and decide that the ends justify the means if they get what they want. I would like to believe people will be more intelligent than that and see that the world isn't 'black' or 'white' but rather shades of grey(no, not that crappy movie trilogy they justwrapped up) and approach it in a thoughtful manner but only time will tell. <br/><br/>All in all, I have to give this movie a very solid 4 stars. At the end of the day it's still a superhero movie but I have to give them credit for really trying to address real world issues like race and resources(even if people take a message that Disney might not have wanted them to take from it) that could very easily have been glossed over with few likely caring."
"Heshvan","7","2","5","21 February 2018"," A Decent Marvel Outing
","I saw this film last night. I found the first half hour pretty slow, but it eventually got going and I found myself enjoying it slightly more than I had anticipated.<br/><br/>1. Special Effects: Good, with a few very good parts, especially in a couple of the vision scenes. <br/><br/>2. Acting: All characters were well cast, keeping with Marvel's record (in my opinion). Very impressed with Chadwick Boseman's portrayal of T'Challa. He is believable as a king new to the throne and a man with a good heart who wants to be a good ruler. There was good interaction between him and his cousin, too.<br/><br/>3. Story: Average, as stated above, it took a while before I really got into it, probably the longest out of any of the MCU movies.<br/><br/>4. Humour: Classic Marvel<br/><br/>I rate this film 7/10. It is good fun. I will probably watch again in the future, but I'm in no rush."

Angela Bassett was also amazing as well as Forest Whitaker!<br/><br/>So what didn't I like about it? I wish the story had been worked on a little more. Here is what I mean, I pretty much knew everything that was going to happen next. It was very play by play.<br/><br/>Some of the visual effects were amazing and some were a little off. The last fight between Killmonger and Black Panther seemed a little repetitive and boring. I expected to see Black Panther have a little more action throughout the film also being a superhero and not fighting so much without his powers. <br/><br/>I was left hoping for a little more. But the film is still a fun experience and I recommend everyone watch it at least once - especially if you like superheros."
"themostnoblecaleb-smith","10","4","14","27 April 2018"," Great Movie

"darksun-945-813498","10","4","14","21 March 2018"," Excellent!!!
","This movie was fantastic! There is an awful lot of hate in some of these reviews...and we all know exactly why. It was beautifully shot and superbly acted with a wonderful plot and well written storyline. Ranking among the best movies I've ever seen, definitely the best Marvel movie, and without question the best superhero movie. This sets a standard, like Deadpool, Winter Soldier, and the Dark Knight series, but easily surpasses them. Definitely a contender for next award season.<br/><br/>You can't call yourself a fan of Black Panther, Marvel, comic book movies, fantasy, or movies in general, and hate on this one. What Coogler and company did here is truly special. And to only be his third film? Well deserving of the budget. <br/><br/>So, let me try to do this with no spoilers...<br/><br/>T'Challa/Black Panther is the king of Wakanda, a landlocked country, hidden from the world, located in Southeast Africa. It boasts the most technologically advanced society on the planet, yet still maintains its traditionalist culture. For those surprised, even angered (triggered) by the fact that a movie based in Africa, about a country that has never been colonized, boasts a virtually all Black cast....duh! Really? What did you expect? <br/><br/>Applying various aspects borrowed from many very real cultures and societies from across the continent helped to bring this masterpiece to life and connect to not only those who felt they've been largely ignored, those of African decent, but it also seemed to resonate well with people across the globe. This is a worldwide cultural phenomenon. The rapid success at the box office testifies to this fact. Truth be told, even the amount of hate it continue receive just goes to show how powerful and positive this movie is. There are actual campaigns designed to bring it down...futilely, but these efforts do exist.<br/><br/>Each character played his or her part very well in this play. Each represents a portion of they global African diasporal mindset. From T'Challa, to Killmonger, to Nakia, M'Baku, Okoye, Shuri, and beyond...each showing that Black people abroad are not a monolith. That although we may have differing ideas, philosophies, languages, cultures, etc., we can still form a fully functional society, contrary to what's been shown in the past -or even what continues to be shown today. It also asks the question ""what would Africa, and the world, be without colonialism, European imperialism, and interference?""<br/><br/>If you view each character as a representation of a philosophy, it takes on a totally new and exciting perspective. Traditionalism vs modernism, globalism vs isolationism, loyalty vs ambition, sins of the father vs self atonement and forgiveness...I could go on, and on, but what it does not trod out are the tired old tropes; men vs women, all evil vs all good (there's really no such thing anymore), etc. There's no deranged bad guy trying to take over the world just because he's bored, or destroy it because he didn't get pancakes. These characters are 100% human and relatable. They're flawed, opinionated, funny, brilliant, brave, and true to themselves. They love, they fear, the get angry, they hurt, they laugh...what more can you ask for? And for those who have a problem because they're Black despite the very obvious fact that they're African), just pretend they're white...like Hollywood has been doing since it's inception. Or you can just get over it."
"tpreddie","10","4","14","13 March 2018"," Excellent movie that ticked off colonizers
","From the beginning, this movie have nearly 20,000 reviews before the movie even came out. Most of them negative. Blame it on DC Fanboys or blame it on internet cowards who like to stir the pot of racism. Box office numbers prove that it was well received. <br/><br/>It is disheartening to read some of the negative comments because you can tell they were racially motivated. Some people complained about dialog that wasn't even present in the movie. When the reviewers can't probably write a coherent 500 word essay. Others stated that Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman had the best performances. (Both of whom are favorites of mine) <br/><br/>This movie was about both the Africans and African Americans and how that relationship was strain due to the middle passage and diaspora of African Americans. It is a story about a Prince who is transitioning into King yet has to struggle with the truth of the sins of his father. That struggle manifests itself with Killmonger. Killmonger obviously represents African Americans, while obviously T'Challa does the same for Africans. Killmonger has a hatred of ""colonizers"" because of the oppression A.A. around the world outside of Wakanda. While T'Challa had a mistrust of colonizers from what was done to the people on the continent of Africa.<br/><br/>It is okay to not like the movie if it is for true and authentic reasons, but when you don't like it because of your biased towards people of color and you unfairly rate a movie is just ridiculous 1920's way of thinking. There was also a person comparing the Jabari tribe to the Fraternity Omega Psy Phi, inncorrect and please read the comic. They were the Ape tribe and Ryan Coogler decided to not call M'Baku Man Ape (for obvious reasons that A.A's have been called monkeys for years) after the character he was portraying. All I ask is that people give an honest review, not biased by race or misogyny or hate. We support movies that cast mostly white people, we just ask you to learn understand and respect one of ours."

","Black Panther: A Movie to Remember
By: Jonathan Martellini <br/><br/>Black Panther was a major step forward for Marvel and their superhero dynasty. It was a movie that was not only extremely entertaining, it also was able to connect to modern-day issues in a way that we haven't seen before from Marvel. The movie was able to hit several hot topics in today's society, without having to completely alienate those who may disagree with such views. The cast also assisted in making this message prevalent and pronounced. 
The cast, which included Michael B. Jordan, Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong'o and Martin Freeman, and predominantly black cast, showed Marvel's embracement for diversity. It also gave African-American kids a superhero to see on the big screen that looks just like them. Marvels diverse cast has led to a new superhero that looks like many of the people who need a superhero to emulate and act like. 
 The movie itself was a fantastic showing of Marvel's creativity, digital and special effects skills. It is filled with adventure and danger. Wakanda, the homeland, was constructed as beautifully as any other Marvel world before it. It also is different in the sense that Wakanda, is its own place while many other Marvel movie settings are depicted in the real world. Wakanda instead is both. Located in Africa, Wakada is it's own made-up country that is much more technologically advanced than it is presented to the world. Wakanda is it's own world, with its own cities, far more advanced than anything here in America or anywhere else in the world. 
Marvel has never made this kind of a movie. They've never developed such a realistic world and haven't addressed so many social issues in the way they did in Black Panther. The real-ness of the setting combined with the acting and the overall message of the movie make for a blockbuster that Marvel has never seen before.

"TheMovieDiorama","8","4","14","24 February 2018"," Black Panther is a political statement disguised as an exciting superhero blockbuster.
","The enormity of the pressure that has manifested over time for this film has been nothing short of extraordinary. Not just for Marvel Studios as they continue their effortless cinematic universe, but for the multicultural film industry. The biggest blockbuster featuring a predominantly black cast, I have to applaud every single contribution made...they never succumbed to the pressure and have produced one of Marvel's stronger chapters. T'Challa returns to Wakanda after the events of 'Civil War' and must prove to be a worthy successor to the throne. Meanwhile, the precious resources secluded in this region are slowly becoming noticed by other nations, to which a worthy adversary soon arrives to challenge T'Challa. We are presented with an ever present scale. Either securing an extremely powerful material for the benefit of one nation or distributing it to other countries to establish a sense of hierarchy. This subtle political message adds that additional layer of depth amidst the hectic action. Boasted by energetic engrossing performances from all cast members, and we have ourselves a successful blockbuster. The story surprisingly was thick with plenty of world building, memorable characters and a few shifts in motives that provide some complexity to the narrative. A barrage of humour, some jokes land and several lines do not...I'm looking at you whoever included ""What are those!?"". The fight choreography was well executed, particularly during the ritual challenges. The visual effects were put to good use, Wakanda's architecture and technology was creatively inventive. The human CGI still remains mediocre, and is ridiculously noticeable during the final battle. The soundtrack masterfully blends African drums with American beats, highlighting modern and cultural significance. Oh, and finally a villain that just doesn't want to destroy the world. How refreshing. It really does come to no surprise that Marvel Studios continue their current dominance in blockbuster cinema."
"AnishMisra","9","4","14","23 February 2018"," Black Panther Review
","Black Panther is a film co-written and directed by Ryan Coogler. After a brief appearance in Civil War, I was very happy to hear this character getting a solo film. The trailers looked awesome and increased my expectations for it. Finally, after watching the film I can say that it was a great film.<br/><br/>Plot: T'Challa returns home as king of Wakanda but finds his sovereignty challenged by a long-time adversary, in a conflict with global consequences.<br/><br/>Story and direction: Ryan Coogler was the perfect director for this film as he breathed new life in the MCU as he very nicely did it in the Rocky Series. The story very nicely intertwines the African culture along with the issues that every African American faces. This film is not the regular sueprhero film, which makes it stand apart from the rest. The characters of this film also make you glued to the screen. We have T'Challa who has a lot of responsibility not only as king but to the world also as a citizen. Then Killmonger, who also has a point in his statements but goes about it maybe in the wrong way. Which makes his villain mean something and stand-apart. Dora Milaje aspect was also great. The production values are enormous and it feels justified. Also the designs for Wakanda were awesome. It looked like a country that I would like to visit in the future. The background score was awesome. It further infused in the African Culture. Hats off to Ryan and team for the hard work put into this venture. The action scenes although minimal, were awesome and great. Where the film failed were the VFX. Considering that MCU have given great spectacles for almost 10 years now, VFX not being upto the mark is almost equal to a sin. <br/><br/>Performance: Chadwick Boseman was great as T'Challa. The various shades of his character were perfectly acted by him. But the icing on the cake was Michael B Jordan. He pulled of the conflicted character with ease. People may not be wrong in saying of him being the best villain since Loki. Lupita N'yongo and Danai Gurira were earnest in their roles. Letitia Wright was quite the Q in this venture. Her comic timing was spot on. Daniel Kaluuya delivered a good performance.Winston Duke was great too. So was Angela Bassett and Martin Freeman. Andy Serkis proves that not is he only great at motion capture but also in real acting too. It was good to see Forest Whittaker and Sterling K Brown utilized nicely. And finally, Stan Le. No Marvel movie is complete without this genius.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be the one where T'Challa comes to know about something in the past and shares his thought with Nakai. Then Nakai says that its upto T'Challa as to what kind of king he wants to be. This scene stuck with me as this showed even though Wakanda was the most advanced technologically but the people using it are humans.<br/><br/>Verdict: Although it may not be the best of MCU, but it still is an enjoyabke and entertaining film for me. I had a great time with this film and yes, if you are wondering, I had to wait till the credits as there are post credit scenes in this film. Can't wait for Infinity War. <br/><br/>I am going with a 9/10."

Before seeing the movie I thought I was all the social justice warriors over hyping it for some racial brownie points. I was wrong and the good reviews are genuine and reliable. I watched this movie at 9.45pm since being awake at 4am and was gripped! The last Jedi couldn't keep me awake in the same scenario.

"nandidot","10","4","14","17 February 2018"," Exhilarating, Emotional, and Impactful
","Every time I think Marvel has produced a great movie the studio outdoes itself. With its latest release, 'Black Panther', it reaches unimaginable heights. I felt extremely proud watching this movie. It changes the conversation and gives us a new hero, a relatable hero. Heroes aren't defined by a certain race or culture and Black Panther embraces its roots while telling a captivating story. Exhilarating, emotional, and impactful- this one is a game changer.<br/><br/>We were introduced to T'Challa, Black Panther, in 'Captain America: Civil War' a couple of years ago. His strength and conviction stood out then and I looked forward to seeing his story. After his father's untimely demise T'Challa takes the throne of Wakanda, a mysterious and isolated country in Africa that is years ahead of the rest of the world. Black Panther works as an origin story, a thriller, a social narrative, and a family saga all rolled into one. There's immense depth and a strong voice leading the film. The action is sharp and eye popping. There's grit and wit in equal measure and it doesn't shy away from hurtful truths. It's exactly what you want from a superhero movie and so much more.<br/><br/>Director Ryan Coogler has shown Wakanda and its people with tremendous admiration. The characters are fully fleshed out and unapologetically black. Their pride is envy worthy. It's deeply gratifying to be able to identify with a character on screen. But an entire nation? It was unheard of before this film. The backbone of the movie, a compelling screenplay, plays out wonderfully on screen and is both moving and amusing. There's never a dull moment with these characters. And what beautiful characters!<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman leads the pack with his terrific portrayal of T'Challa- a man overcoming obstacles, a king trying to find his way, and a hero who has barely scratched the surface. The supporting cast is equally brilliant. Michael B. Jordan brings the right amount of menace and angst to his character creating a villain you want to root for. Another highlight of the movie, or I should say its strongest attribute, is the powerful women. Warriors, intellectuals, leaders, and spies. Each one stronger than the king, each one deserving of her own movie. Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and Letitia Wright are perfect. I am in awe.<br/><br/>Representation matters. We hear it, we say it, and now we see it in action. Never again will a person of color have to wonder what it would be like to look like their heroes. As an avid movie watcher I'm filled with joy.

"NicoleMae12203","10","11","55","17 February 2018"," A Great Balance: It Had Identity
","Not only was Black Panther a film technically well-made - from the research, storytelling, visual effects, and, especially, the soundtrack - but Black Panther also made an impact. Despite some reviews calling it quite too ambitious (a fact that I did not see at all), it understood its role within the MCU and, quite obviously, society, which left moviegoers exiting the theaters with an agreeable praise. <br/><br/>Personally, the best opinion that I have of Black Panther is that it had a plethora of great balance. <br/><br/>It invited us into a world filled with African tradition while adding sci-fi nuances; I felt like I learned about classic African culture while simultaneously discovering advanced technology unlike anything I've seen before. <br/><br/>The story was well-paced and did not, for one second, waste the potential of any of the characters. There were many players introduced into this complex story, but they all had a voice to play - just as we do - in a world crumbling due to political tensions (something quite prominent in this film haha) and a kingdom divided by a tradition and progress. In fact, I think the abundance of characters each holding onto what's important to them in such contentious times is what simplified the story. Each person eventually came to an internal understanding of their roles within Wakanda, which helped center the story back to King T'Challa. In turn, this leaves more gravitas on his controversial decisions as a new king.<br/><br/>Killmonger (especially) is a character that lingers in my brain because he really embodies the victimized portrayal of ""the villain is the hero in his own story"". Despite being extremely belligerent and confrontational, he was a villain who is more centered than the average politician and has more purpose than many current world leaders. His arguments held truth, and I am 99% sure that the only reason that his ideals weren't executed was because he was too aggressive and not diplomatic enough. Killmonger makes a GREAT antihero to the untried King T'Challa because he made the newly crowned, untried, and demure T'Challa open his eyes to lives of the other 2 billion black people in the world. Consequently, this resolved T'Challa's inner strength and made him more politically adept; ironically, I'll even argue that Killmonger MADE his own foil by bringing out a diplomatic and resolute King T'Challa to Killmonger's brute and hostile nature. <br/><br/>Killmonger left us with many thought-provoking statements about oppression, the role of blacks all over the world, and our duty as people (or kings) to help each other without being an overbearing character or compromising T'Challa's already burdened storyline on being a new king.<br/><br/>In its own right, the film fits perfectly into our current societal climate and the Marvel Cinematic Universe - into this already complex sci-fi/magical world on the screen and the even more complicated world of reality.<br/><br/>I could go on with the many, many well-executed aspects of this film. But just by watching the film, you don't need an overly long list or review to get the idea that because of the story, technical details, and a justified but respectful message, Black Panther definitely opens the identity of - and thus gives more voice to - modern black society."
"j_forbesy","9","11","55","14 February 2018"," Black Panther Review
","Black Panther is the 18th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the last before the MCU's biggest film yet, Avengers: Infinity War. Black Panther was always going to be a comic book film that held significance. Like Wonder Woman last year, Black Panther has a cultural significance to it that is going to have a positive effect for the communities it is representing.<br/><br/>Like all MCU films in recent years, Black Panther has it's own unique feel. This film has the perfect blend of the space and futuristic setting that Guardians presents with the ancientness and mystical shown in Doctor Strange. Ryan Coogler's directing really leans into that with many shots and scenes embracing the style and reaping the benefits.<br/><br/>Also adding to the overall unique feel of the film is the use of music and score. I have always been a big fan of Ludwig Goransson's work with Childish Gambino and I though he did an amazing job with the music. The way it blended African instruments into the score and background music helped set the tone that this film presents. Much credit can also be given to Kenrick Lamar and the decision to bring him on in the first place for the soundtrack. Throughout the film you can hear his touches all throughout and it was a perfect foil to the tradition African instruments.<br/><br/>While I have given much credit to the technical aspects of the film, it does not discount the work done by Ryan Coogler and his cast. As mentioned before, Coogler set a tone with this film that feels really unique and did a terrific job in pulling as these pieces together. The work done by Coogler puts him up there along side the work done by Taika Watiti last year as some of the best directing done by a director in the MCU.<br/><br/>Getting into the cast, every one amazing in what they had to do. This film had quite a large cast and majority of them got a least one big moment that they got to step up and take a lead role in a scene. To highlight a few performances, Chadwick Boseman took what he did in Civil War and pushed it to a new limit, Michael B. Jordan nailed the role and cemented himself as one of the best villains in the MCU and Lupita Nyong'o brought life into a new character that I am looking forward to seeing in the years to come. Mentioning these roles of course takes nothing away from all the other great performances such as Letita Wright, Andy Serkis, Martin Freeman, Forest Whitaker, Daniel Kaluuya and Danai Gurira.<br/><br/>Like all MCU films, Black Panther is packed full of action. Again like most MCU films, the action style from Black Panther is a lot different to what we have previously see. The closest comparison for the style of action is something like from the TV show Vikings. We get to see some great tribe battles while getting some really well executed one on one battles. <br/><br/>What most of the MCU films get right is the overall writing of the film, and Black Panther is no different. The story was extremely well written and fleshed out. The overall dialog with the characters was great with some terrific beats of humour. From a writing standpoint, there isn't anything in this film that could be seen as at least solid writing.<br/><br/>Black Panther is a film that I believe doesn't have any glaring negatives. While each person will come out with little things here and there they didn't enjoy about the film, it is hard to pin point anything that felt out of place or poorly executed. For me, the only slight negative I had is that I feel that the film did not overall cover that much story. While I never felt like the pacing was off or that anything was rushed through, when I looked back at the film and recap it in my head, the list of everything that happened felt quite short. I would have been perfectly happy if they extended the film by 10 minutes or so and added an extra sequence, however the film works perfectly fine without it.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved this film. While I am not the community that this film is going to effect significantly, I could still feel the significance of it like I did with Wonder Woman. On top of that, this film is a technical masterclass that all by helps the terrific performances and work done by Ryan Coogler and everyone else involved.<br/><br/>9/10"

","First let me say that this is my first time going to see a movie during ""opening"" weekend and I was not expecting to wait in line for an hour. However, the wait was worth it! I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the story line was great. I was told it was a fairly lengthy movie and I usually do not do well in long movies. However, this one was good from beginning to end! Although I wish there would have been a little more action, I was not disappointed. I'm already anticipating the squeal.

","Had its moments, and was enjoyable, but they hype train derails pretty quick.
I did like how the story was about Black Panther, and his origin as king, not really about him becoming BP (he was already that in Civil War). There were lots of people saying things like ""breaks the Marvel mold"" This is a brave new direction for superhero films"".
It doesn't and its not. The only one that has changed the mold was Winter Soldier, a movie that was a spy thriller first and a super hero movie second, but we are not talking about that movie here.
The acting in the movie, for the most part, is fine. Some actors really did need to step up their game, but they didn't get too much time wasted on them.<br/><br/>The villain, though better with his motives, was just as forgettable as the rest of the villains in this franchise.<br/><br/>If you are a marvel fan, yes you will like it, if you are a super hero fan, yes you will like it....will you need to come back and see it again...well I don't, but hey maybe they hype worked on you...."

","Black Panther was amazing. The idea of it itself is amazing but the film is also a sight to behold. It's not a perfect movie by any stretch, but how many perfect films are there. We get a Marvel villian that actually has a legit motivation and can be sympathized with. Killomger is the most compelling Marvel villain since Loki. The film was stunning visually and all the characters were lovable. I am excited for the future of this franchise and expect at least 2 more films in addition to Wakanda's large role in the upcoming Avenger's film. <br/><br/>Wakanda Forever!"
"JJdaPK","8","7","31","16 February 2018"," A Breath of Fresh Air for the Marvel Cinematic Universe
","Black Panther was pretty great and it avoids most of the problems that plague many of Marvel's other movies. It has a unique story to tell and does the best it can to tell that story instead of wasting its time serving as a trailer for future Avengers movies. It uses humor wisely and does not kill several dramatic or intense scenes by throwing in a cheap joke. It lets the emotional moments sink in, and does not try to undercut them.<br/><br/>The villain is a fully realized character with an understandable motivation, and he has personal ties to our hero. Great. We need more believable antagonists like this! In fact, pretty much all of the characters - even the supporting ones - were fleshed out and given time to shine. The worldbuilding was also well done and most people will leave the movie wishing they could go to the country of Wakanda. 8/10.<br/><br/>Black Panther does not reach the heights of comic book masterpieces like The Dark Knight or Logan, but I'd say it's a cut above most of the superhero movies that came out last year, including Thor Ragnarok, Spider-man Homecoming, Wonder Woman, Gaurdians of Galaxy 2 and the horrid Justice League (hatethatmovie)."
"appysamanosuke","7","8","37","17 February 2018"," Black Panther, A new stand alone movie form marvel.
","If there is anything that makes you more happier than watching a marvel movie first day-first show, then this film is for you. Just a humble reminder, this review is SPOILER FREE,so read along.
Firstly, you aren't a true marvel fan if you are reading this, but if you are not sure and are confused about the mixed reception this movie is getting, then may be you should consider going through this article.
CAST-
The casting, as every other marvel film is just perfect. Chadwick Boseman, who was last seen dawning the black panther outfit in Captain America- Civil war has done justice to the role, and we all loved his performance as king of Wakanda. Micheal Jordon who plays the lead antagonist in the film is rumoured to be the best marvel villain after Loki (and of course excluding the titan Thanos) but I would like to disagree. The role did demand a level of seriousness, but I loved Andy Serkis as Klaw.He did cracked us up with his great coming timing and funny behaviour.Coming to the female lead Nupita Nyong'o, am I the only one or she really looks similar to Jennifer Lawrence? The rest of the cast faithfully presented as their respective soles demanded.<br/><br/>The writers did an amazing job in telling us a story of Wakanda, and linking it to El dorado. It does gets a bit predictable at times, but you do have a good share of scenes where you involuntarily will go ""Ohhhhhs"" & ""Ahhhhhhs"".
The action scenes are few but brilliantly executed,and the Wakandan empire, the most advance country in marvel cinematic universe does blow your mind with all its science and technology.<br/><br/>I can identify why people are not appreciate the movie and the ratings are also not what it deserved. The first one being inadequate action (perhaps?). The trailer packed us all with loads of excitement,but the movie was more of a great plot and drama but a bit less of action. Also, there are obviously going to be comparison between this movie and the last marvel film, Thor-Ragnarok. The third instalment for the Thor series, is considered,by far, the best marvel film ever, and mainly due to its superb comic timing. Black panther too does boast scenes which tickle your funny bone, but we also need to understand that this is the first Black panther stand alone movie, and considering that the movie is fit to be called a blockbuster. Not to forget what marvel movies are famous for, a good Stan Lee cameo and a post credit scene as well, which I not going to reveal.<br/><br/>DO NOT READ this paragraph if you haven't watched the movie till now.
The greatest disappointment was that there was no sign of the soul stone. There were a lot of valid arguments and speculations about soul stone to be introduced in this movie, which didn't come true.<br/><br/>My conclusion is that no matter what the world thinks,this is a marvel film and YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT!!"
"sushant-82326","6","5","20","16 February 2018"," Everything in this film it's a hit or miss.
","I got to see this film a few a days back and It was....mind numbingly mediocre just like most other MCU films. Maybe I had too high expectations for it due to the hype but a lot of elements felt way worse than other marvel flicks.<br/><br/>The action(both fight scenes and action set pieces) ranged from semi-decent to God awful. The final fight in particular had terrible CGI and wonky physics. The normal fight scenes weren't that good either. They were both shot(sometimes it feels like the cameraman is having a seizure while the combatants are having a slap fight, sample of what you're going to get I guess) and choreographed terribly. It's like they watched the fight style of the Raid films but forgot hire good stuntmen and choreographers.The MCU can do really intense fight scenes like the elevator fight in TWS but nothing in this movie comes even close to that. So anyone expecting badass fights based on BPs scenes in civil war, you're going to be massively disappointed.<br/><br/>Edit: sample of the final fight I am talking about as well<br/><br/>This isn't a work print. This is what you will get in the cinema. I got called a troll for saying it. So you can look at it yourselves.<br/><br/>If anybody thought the CGI in wonder woman climax was a turn off , then you're certainly not going to like this and unlike WW the CGI is like this in most CGI heavy scenes in the film.(particularly the car chase yikes).<br/><br/>The world building is good if you think Bright and the Star wars prequels had great world building. It just felt artificial for the most part(again partly because of the mediocre CGI), you're not going to get a memorable location like the cantina bar or the Troll market from Hellboy 2 which feels like real places with it's own unique personalities. Wakanda for the most part like Asgard has a few cool establishing shots where we see some interesting designs but they're are not really fleshed out much and again the uneven CGI isn't exactly helping.<br/><br/>The villain is above 99% of other marvel villains for he mere fact he has a lasting impact on he hero and for being somewhat sympathetic, though I felt the characterization itself was a bit disjointed. However his dialogue is often absolute cringe, he seems to awkwardly switch on and off his AAVE which just seems forced. I thought his final piece dialogue for example was absolutely forced and cringeworthy. The actor, I think did his best with what he got and he felt more interesting than the rest of the characters in the movie.<br/><br/>The music was decent in this movie(though I didn't care for the rap which was mostly centered around Eric but then again I am not huge rap fan, so don't out too much weight on my opinion on this one). Most of it's themes are pretty obvious and blatant as well.This movie definitely isn't going to win any awards for subtlety.Overall, the movie just felt generic.<br/><br/>I know movies are subjective but anyone who says this is a masterpiece or groundbreaking in anyway whether it be effects, acting,action or even the plot(I don't think this movie does anything new or anything that's even new for CBMs except for the nearly all black cast I guess) is quite frankly a fanboy or someone who hasn't watched much films.<br/><br/>That's all I have to say about this movie. It's solid 5/10 for me but I am guessing if you liked the previous MCU films you'll probably enjoy this as well but for others go in with tempered expectations."
"mercury_rising_1","10","8","38","16 February 2018"," Much Deeper Than The Visual Spectacle
","Black Panther will frighten many people. The depth and acknowledgement of native African and African-American social and cultural history will be viewed by some with fear and skepticism. As a 'conscious' middle-aged African-American male, the theme, the scope and the subject matter (father/son relationships, disconnected from lineage, home(land) and history, etc.) will immediately resonate with those of us in the 'community' who can relate to these issues. For many, these images, in this film, may seem wasteful and monotonous. But for those of us in the African-American community (especially here in the U.S.), these representations are displays of our totality as humane human beings whose emotional turmoil is finally being addressed. <br/><br/>Having such a majestic, intellectually and visually stunning big-budget, big-screen major Hollywood movie production with an overwhelmingly dominant African-American cast - who exist in positions of power, control and authority, and not in servile or secondary roles - has the potential to skewer the perception of the uninitiated or the uninformed because Black Panther is a type of production that has never-before been seen in this way and on this scale. <br/><br/>While there may be some who miss nuanced references common within the African-American diaspora (expressions, relationships, tone, presence) that are reflective in our interactions with each other - outside of mainstream engagement, the political pronouncements will probably engender the most backlash and confusion. From the Dora Milaje, to the descriptions of black and brown people as kings, queens, scientists, thinkers, world leaders and leaders of men and women, such representations of regal strength and character present a stark departure from that which is ubiquitous in the landscape of film, television, print, radio and mass/social media proliferation."
"rikardsimenslarsen","9","8","38","15 February 2018"," Rugged, Bold and Great Movie - Is what I think!
","A rugged movie - with bold choice of role crew. Something that's actually needed, in today's worldview. The movie is great. Although something could be done better. But the best thing about the whole movie is actually all the amazing female actors: Lupita Nyong'o, Angela Bassett, Letitia Wright, Danai Gurira, Florence Kasumba, Nabiyah Be, Connie Chiume, Zola Williams etc.. We can really talk about black girl power, beauty and power hand in hand. That some things could have been done elsewhere does not really matter. But it will be a little bit of it when it comes to my overall assessment."
"Nestion","Null","8","38","15 February 2018"," The Superhero Movie Every Person Should See
","The truth is this movie is fantastic. It is a film that celebrates some of the most sacred building blocks of community and prosperity. Coogler, who is still fresh off the success of his two brilliant previous films (Fruitvale Station, Creed), returns with his most ambitious and rewarding film yet and I can personally guarantee that despite the obvious success he has ahead of him, this movie will forever be a jewel in Coogler's crown. Black Panther does so much to elevate not just what a superhero movie can be, but what it has the potential to say. Indeed, Black Panther's defining moments are not the action sequences (although they are breathtaking to say the least), but are truly the character moments, especially those that contribute to Black Panther's overall narrative which is to keep moving towards a brighter future, despite the darkness that may lie in the sins of the past. Chadwick Boseman dominates as both T'Challa and Black Panther. He manages to both say so much with an expression, and yet also beautifully put to words the complex struggles he faces over the course of the movie. And in complete honesty, Boseman does carry this movie on his shoulders. Luckily he has a phenomenal circle of deeply engaging and complex characters within his inner circle to lighten that weight. Letitia Wright as Shuri is a particular stand out as her wit and humour is guaranteed to make anyone with a beating heart smile. Danai Gurira is incredible as the ruthless Okoye, and Lupita Nyong'o manages to accomplish such a gorgeous balance of guiding hand and warrior. But, when it comes down to it, this movie would not be what it is without Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger. This is by far the best villain the MCU has ever had (yes even better than Loki). Jordan manages to be both merciless and cold hearted, all while emanating the rage and torture of being a man with nothing to lose, because everything he had has already been taken from him. You will both despise and want more of Killmonger and that is where a good villain should be. Finally, we must discuss the utter magnificence that is Wakanda. Black Panther displays its enthralling African kingdom with so much marvellous detail that it makes you wish it were a real place so you could hop on the next plane there. But beyond it's allure and beauty, Wakanda is a place of culture and tradition. While the movie easily could have skipped past the Wakandan world building, it is clear that those behind the camera were determined to give viewers a taste of a unique culture that also draws on so many ancient African elements, all while effortlessly blending it with colour, technology, and other more futuristic elements. One of my favourite things about this movie is that while it is clearly an MCU movie, it has nothing to do with the MCU besides the involvement of Klaue and the metal Vibranium. So, at no point in this film will you feel as if the movie is trying to build towards some other payoff in a different movie. This is Black Panther's movie and it is solely about his journey and what him and his people are going through. This makes the movie that much more captivating because it immediately allows the viewer to understand that they are watching a great film in general and not just a great MCU film. 
All in all I have to give Black Panther a 10/10 for being more than just a movie, but also a message and a movement."
"vedatyil","9","8","38","14 February 2018"," Kinda suprised
","It should be said that all characters have been exquisitely cast. Chadwick remains a very strong Black Panther and the secondary characters are brought to live admirably. Especially Danai Gurira as Okoye and Letitia Wright, as his brilliant younger sister, shine in their parts.
The music is also really good, which gives you an extra reason to linger during the credits while you wait for the usual fun bonus.
Ludwig Goransson deserves all the praise because the orchestral music that blares during the exciting moments is also filled with African instruments. 
A very nice look at a superhero world in which African cultures are honoured. A good story about a prince who has to take on the role of a king and the change in the political climate.This movie differs from other MCU movies and it is close to ""CA:winter soldier"",quality wise"
"CANpatbuck3664","8","6","26","19 February 2018"," Black Panther is Another Solid Entry in a Continually Expanding MCU
","With the glut of superhero movies being released in theatres, one of the things that I credited movies like Deadpool and Logan for was trying to tell a more personable story. It doesn't have to be about saving the world, just introduce some characters we can enjoy following and provide some motivation we can relate to. Black Panther centres around the rivalry/conflict between T'Challa and Killmonger and I think that's an interesting choice. Killmonger is a shadowy version of what T'Challa could have been and the movie brings you along with their new king's struggle to understand his father's and his uncle's actions. But the important thing about this is you understand the differing perspectives of the characters and while you're cheering for T'Challa, you can at least understand where Killmonger is coming from. Their situation doesn't come with an easy answer and this problem compounds T'Challa's other issues (dealing with the death of his father, the responsibilities of running Wakanda, Nakia not reciprocating his affection for her etc.). The character development in this movie was pretty good and I appreciated the effort put in that way.<br/><br/>The strength of this movie is that its effective in bringing you into this new and exciting environment. The kingdom of Wakanda is beautiful and is a pleasant change of pace for a Marvel movie. They play up the more traditional aspects of life in Africa while providing a new spin on it. It makes it easier to digest some bits of exposition and I would credit Coogler and his team for doing something off-beat. The cinematography was excellent, and the special effects were first rate. Couple that with some interesting technology and gadgets for our heroes and villains to interact with, there are few scenes where they don't utilize something fun to punch up the action or even the drama.<br/><br/>This movie is populated by accomplished actors and actresses, but I was legitimately surprised on who impressed me the most. Chadwick Boseman is a star on the rise. He's got a lot of ability and charisma and while I enjoy his more dramatic performances (Marshall and 42) he slips into Black Panther with ease. Michael B. Jordan had a lot of energy in his performance and he was obviously giving it his all. He's a lot better in this compared to the Fantastic 4 but he was still bordering on overacting for me. I would give him credit for being one of the more impactful Marvel villains of recent memory. Andy Serkis is having a blast in the other villainous role as Ulysses Klaue. He's an awesome actor who doesn't get his due. Daniel Kaluuya was good after his breakout in Get Out, he's very measured here and strong. It was fun to see Lupita Nyong'o, she owned her scenes completely. Letita Wright gave one of the funnier performances in the film as T'Challa's sister Shuri. My favourite performance came from Danai Gurira as General Okoye. She sold all her scenes; her character has a strict code of honour that came across well in her acting. She is passable as a military leader (which is no mean feat) and yet there were some moments in the movie where she managed to be funny as well. She was very well rounded and deserves credit in her supporting role.<br/><br/>One of the reasons that this movie will be so popular is that it is promoting diversity. We don't get many African-American superheroes (let alone a superhero from Africa) so it is important to get them right when they get the chance. Black Panther tackles this challenge as well as they could have. Not only is the story interesting and the actors/actresses are clearly on their game, but they incorporate how difficult it can be to come from the background that these fictional characters come from. It is not only addressed but it is at the forefront and they don't falter. I guess that shouldn't be a surprise considering who is involved with this project, but it is worth mentioning nonetheless.<br/><br/>The biggest problem that this movie suffered from isn't even the fault of the people who made it. The hype surrounding Black Panther got a little out of control. Is this a good movie? Absolutely. Is it one of the better standalone Marvel films? You can absolutely make that argument. Best Marvel movie ever? For me, not even close. It absolutely deserves praise for the things that it gets right but people need to calm down a little. I would put this firmly in the middle somewhere, Marvel is the victim of continued success that way so simply making a good film doesn't qualify as doing something amazing for the studio (a comparison I would use is A Bug's Life or Brave, both are good movies but compared to the rest of Pixar's output, neither are exceptional). I had a couple of smaller issues, the action was very middle of the road, I didn't find a show-stopping moment in any of the fight scenes. Some of the characters arcs weren't satisfying, I feel like the only reason Martin Freeman's Everett Ross was included was to connect to the rest of the MCU, he had little to do on his own.<br/><br/>Another few months go by and another exciting/action-packed movie put out by Marvel Studios. This has become the norm and while some people are growing sick of it, if they keep putting out quality material, I'm open to it. Black Panther isn't the second coming for comic book movies but that shouldn't detract from the fact this is a great movie. I would give this an 8.5/10 but I can't quite give it a 9/10. So, I have to go with an 8/10, I would recommend this to comic and non-comic fans alike."

","This movie had amazing cinematography, the cast was phenomenal, and it was a beautiful experience. I wouldn't call it a ""black movie"" and just label it like that. It was a genuinely good superhero movie. Michael B. Jordan was SO good as Kilmonger and by the end of the movie you really do sympathize with him (just as you did with Loki) Really loved Leticia's Shrui and Duke's Baku, both brought the classic Marvel humor. As an asian, I really think its important to see all types of people in pop culture. Again there is no such thing as race, we are all human. Growing up watching Disney princess movies, I would always play Jasmine since she looked the most like me (I'm still growing up) but its so important for kids to see heroes who look like them. Wonder Woman was also really great because I saw a badass female superhero and it really did feel good. I would definitely recommend this movie!! <br/><br/>Negatives: I wish the movie paced properly, the start was kind of slow and then the end was way too fast. <br/><br/>I wish more songs from the soundtrack were included"

","Every time a MCU film comes out, critics hail it as ""Marvel's best film yet"" only for me to find it either good/average (Civil War) or complete trash (Thor: Ragnarok). So, when critics were calling Black Panther the best MCU film, thankfully, I didn't put much stock into it because I don't think it's Marvel's ""best""; that title still belongs to Winter Soldier...BUT I freaking loved the movie; it's definitely in my top 5 MCU films (maybe top 3 but I have to see it again before I can make that decision). The good: it showcased an African nation with different tribes, that were technologically advanced, and had their own natural resources that the world has never seen before. That's significant to me because a lot of African nations were stripped of their natural resources centuries ago, so to see this on screen was a breath of fresh air as was seeing African royalty as opposed to the usual impoverished Africans, gangsters, slaves, thugs, drug dealers etc... The performances were amazing...Boseman was great as usual but the stand outs for me were Letitia Wright (Shuri) and Danai Gurira (Okoye); I'm glad my daughter gets to see 2 strong, intelligent black females on screen. Jordan was a cool villain (a lot better than most of those crappy Marvel villains); I can always appreciate when you can hate a villain's actions but empathize with their motives. The bad: the CGI was rough in a lot of places and some of the action pieces were very muddled. There were a few slow areas, but I often find that happening with origin stories, so I can overlook that. Overall, I really dug this film; for now, I'll give it an 8/10 but that could change upon 2nd viewing. Bravo to Ryan Coogler and his team!!!"

","**SPOILERS**
Black Panther so far is one of the best MCU movies that I've seen to date. The musical score was on point and fit every scene, the set, the colors (One of the reasons why I enjoy GOTG and Thor Ragnorok) I wasn't expecting much humor in BP but I was pleasantly surprised by the small pockets and to me the small jokes and comments fit perfectly. I'm a big fan of a serious storyline mixed with a bit of humor and Ryan did just the right amount. For a movie spanning 2 hours, RG was able give us fascinating characters with well-written arcs out of huge cast and that's not an easy thing to do. 
We learn about T'Challa's rise as a king, wanting to follow his father's footsteps only to find out that his father made huge mistakes and those mistakes have consequences and T'Challa has to change his entire mindset of what it means to be a king.
Nakia's relationship with her homeland and the outside world. Ross had a totally different mindset of what he thought he knew. Eric Kilmonger is simply one of the best developed villains of the MCU. He made you care about him, even though he went about things the evil way. He killed his girl, just like that. But you understood why he was the way he was. 
Okoye with her principles and strict tradition but her eyes were opened that you cannot blindly defend something that is clearly wrong. Unfortunately, her love, W'Kabi was too blinded by the death of his parents to understand that. Even though he disagreed with T'Challa's method, he straight jumped to Kilmonger's side and I thought it was powerful moment when Okoye confronted him on the battlefield. 
Claw was a surprise, I didn't expect that, but he had his purpose and he made a big impression when he was on screen. When they walked through the metal detectors, that had me laughing cause he didn't give an F, lol.
Not a big fan of FW but hey, loved his role and he had been holding on to that guilt of King T'Chaka killing his own brother and leaving the son behind, a long time. When he sacrificed himself, it was for the best.
The Dora Milaje were just bad ass.
Shuri is that little sister that bugs the hell out of you but she's so cute, you can't help but love her, also she's smart as hell and I would love to see her go up against Tony Stark and bring his cockiness down a few notches. That would be fun to see.
Overall, it was entertaining, the music was great, the storyline kept my attention the entire time."
"felisuncia-1","10","4","15","28 February 2018"," Everything expected, amazing!
","This movie came through as it promised. Not sure how people can be so negative while the movie was well done and the acting was spot on. So many people are saying it is inferior simply because the cast is mostly black is beyond unreasonable. One called it ""reverse racist"" and criticized it for being ""too black"". What??? It is a great movie about a Black character and it delivered an entertaining escape from the negativity of the world. Marvel delivered a young heroine who is a brainy nerd. It delivered another two strong women who were right up there fighting injustice with the men. It showed the people of Wakanda to be intelligent, compassionate and desiring peace. This movie was positive and delivered role models that kids growing up in a changing world can look up to. For adults like me, it was good clean entertainment. This kind of movie is what we need more of!"
"matthewssilverhammer","9","4","15","23 February 2018"," Wakanda Forever
","Black Panther uses the superhero genre to have conversations we're all currently having: ""Should we serve our country with blind commitment, or push back against the forces that are destroying it?"" ""Should we use our resources to protect our people, or help others in need?"" That deep interest in societal culture is in every frame of Marvel's latest venture. To be sure, it's a celebration of black culture, and a bright and proud one at that. However, it's also a celebration of culture in general, an awards assembly giving medals to those who lean into their own history, even while improving it. Those themes help Black Panther exudes confidence and power in even its quietest moments. 
Its vigor vibrates from the fictional country of Wakanda, a place so vibrantly beautiful and well-realized you'll wish to jump into the screen. The story of a prince-turned-warrior-king doesn't provide tons of plot-surprises or even a super compelling protagonist. Nevertheless, it soars in its emotionally exciting action scenes (waterfall ceremony), its stacked cast of characters (greatest superhero sibling ever?), and potent villain psychology.
Sure, Coogler has fallen into the Marvel trope of the hero having to fight the evil version of himself at the end of the film. It also follows the recent Marvel trend of creating villains who are empathetic and fully logical, to the point that you find yourself rooting for them. And with Jordan's Killmonger, we're shown one of the most rich and heartfelt antagonists in superhero history, making Boseman's Black Panther confront the truth in the film's line, ""It's hard for a good man to be king."" Thankfully, Black Panther knows that's a challenge worth taking. Wakanda forever."
"dgraham-76034","10","4","15","18 February 2018"," As close to a perfect movie as you can get.
","There's great character development in such a short time in this movie for mostly all the characters and that's it's strong point. The great feeling you get when they first arrive to the Wakanda is unmatched. It's a complicated and compelling family that comes together nicely. The overall theme of the togetherness and how the decisions of few affect many is never lost and constant throughout. All of the characters contain likeability, including the villains, which is very rare for a movie. This movie is a lot to take in within one watch, I myself have seen it three times already. Even though it feels like there's too much in this movie overall, it is truly excellent. If you're not a fan of political and racial truths, this movie is not for you at all. It's more of a movie that happens to be a comic book, more than it is a comic book movie."
"wolfstar_imdb","10","10","52","14 February 2018"," Across-the-board amazing - deeply resonant, iconic and generational, with great cast and score
","Black Panther is one of the most incredible things I've ever, ever seen. The women are AMAZING. The score and sound design are incredible - it's the best score I've ever heard in any film. It's visually beautiful beyond description. I didn't feel like I was watching a Marvel film, and I like Marvel films. It has IDEAS, political thought and a worldview in a way that no other Marvel film has attempted, and is meaningful and resonant in a way blockbusters almost never are. It's deeply non-western. The villain's motivation is understandable and relatable, overcoming the MCU villain problem for probably the first time ever. The cast are tremendous. It's an afrofuturist dream and is, throughout, deeply moving. It's transformative not feelgood, deep not glib, unifying and courageous not divisive. It's better than Harry Potter, better than LOTR, better than The Hunger Games, better than the entire MCU. It takes everything tired about the superhero/epic fantasy/""hero's journey"" genre and transcends/ reconceptualizes it in a way that's never expected and consistently thrilling and gripping. It's impeccably paced and structured and flows completely naturally (in a world where blockbusters are so often a series of setpieces bridged by interstitial dialogue) - it's logical and coherent with plot and character in perfect harmony, nothing feels contrived, committee-written, focus-grouped or market-tested. I'm in absolute raptures over it. It kicks its entire genre out of the park.<br/><br/>This is a film that says you don't have to give up your traditions to be modern and developed. That non-westerners shouldn't be ashamed of their culture and give up their customs, their dress, their music, their dances, everything that gives their culture an identity and that's grown up over hundreds of years, in the rush to westernize. That allows its characters to debate the merits and drawbacks of isolationism versus outreach. This is a revolutionary film that should and will have a huge cultural footprint lasting decades and mean a lot to so many young people. It not only articulates debates between constructive activism and destructive activism, hard and soft power, but has the conviction of its principles to come down on one side of them. It deserves to have a cultural impact as big as the original Star Wars."

","One of the greatest problems of the film industry is undoubtedly the lack of racial, sexual and gender diversity. This was evident in several recent moments, especially in the awards season when some campaigns appeared as #OscarSoWhite and #PayMeToo.
In this scenario, the world of comics came to the forefront and Marvel released, in 2018, box office and critical success Black Panther.
With an outnumbered black cast, as well as in the technical categories, as costume designer and in the soundtrack, Black Panther, based on Marvel's superhero comic book universe, brings the fight of the new king of Wakanda, a fictional country tucked away on the African continent, T'Challa, played by actor Chadwick Boseman, to protect his people and, of course, Vibranium technology from villain Ulysses Klaue and Killmonger.
The film also stars the Oscar-winning actress Lupita N'yong as the warrior and romantic interest of the king, Nakia. Interpreting Okoye, captain of the Dora Milaje, army of Wakanda, we have the great Danai Gurira, famous for his participation in TV series, The Walking Dead.
In the film, Ulysses tries to invade Wakanda to steal Vibranium technology, for which he relies on the other villain, Killmonger, masterfully interpreted by Michael B. Jordan, actor of Creed.
The theft of Vibranium - which occurs in the past, outside the screens - is a central point of the plot. The consequences of this act modify the lives of T'Challa and Killmonger and shake out Wakanda.
While seeking to defend his kingdom, T'Challa discovers that he is a cousin of Killmonger and this one challenges him to a fight where the throne of Wakanda is at stake. In the face of this, a civil war can destroy Wakanda and there is still time for the family plot of Killmonger and T'Challa.
The film broke down barriers to being nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture, the first film nomination for a superhero movie. And as if that were not enough, he gave the two black women the Oscar for Best Costume Design and Best Art Direction, technical categories never before won by black women. It also took the statuette of the best Original Soundtrack.
Fans of superhero T'Challa await a sequel already confirmed by Marvel. It's more an industry film, but it's a great one. It gave us diversity, equality and excellent action scenes."

","There are some films where you can practically hear the history books writing themselves - though if all history books were as outrageously fun as Black Panther, university campuses would be bursting at the seams. Accompanying 2017's Wonder Woman as a triumphant one-two punch of unprecedented blockbuster representation finding record-breaking box office and critical success, Black Panther's real shock is that... yes, it is exactly as good as you'd hope. A robust, whip-smart, emotional, and superbly entertaining thriller as unafraid to dive headlong into contentiously topical politics as unabashedly indulge in superhero silliness. Some things are worth the wait. <br/><br/>And yet, after a dizzyingly gorgeous animated prologue, establishing the MacGuffin mythology of fictional African technology haven Wakanda, we wait even longer, as director Ryan Coogler deviates into a seemingly tangential Prologue 2.0 set in the slums of Oakland, California. It's a disorienting start (but don't worry; it's only moments more before T'Challa spin-kicks someone), but its coy foreshadowing heralds an important lesson: Coogler is an immaculately precise director unaccustomed to wasting a frame of film. No one could accuse Black Panther of being unambitious, with a plot encompassing human trafficking, international arms deals, salient commentaries on tradition vs. modernity, redefining power amidst a global economy, and roughly as many political maneuvers as an entire season of House of Cards (including brazen, poignantly tongue-in-cheek barbs about immigration and colonial history) - as well as, y'know, fight scenes, cool gadgets, and all that other superhero stuff. The seamlessness with which Coogler weaves together each seemingly disparate plot thread and theme is almost mind-boggling - and yet, his film is as much a cohesive entity as it is more than the sum of its parts. <br/><br/>Appropriately, for a superhero film whose production was inevitably delayed for decades due to its affiliation with a revolutionary political party, social politics comprise the core and foundation of Black Panther. Here, Coogler pulls no punches, but is never pedantic. We start out in fun but familiar territory, with a first act globetrotting takedown of Wakanda's arch-nemesis Ulysses Klaue (a gleefully scenery-masticating Andy Serkis, arguably Marvel's most downright fun adversary to date), reminiscent of a contemporary 007 romp (complete with T'Challa's own 'Q,' in Letitia Wright's hysterical, impossibly delightful Shuri). But, right when we begin to settle in and munch our popcorn, Coogler yanks the rug out from us, with a second act tonal shift that flips the film on its head, to the point where more than a few audience members will be left questioning the ethics and legitimacy of the hero we've spent the entire first half admiring as infallible. Enter Michael B. Jordan, who not only energizes the film with a furious surge of passion as he shifts from his early performative swagger to magnetic, fiery dogmatism, but shifts the conflict to a 'Malcolm X vs. MLK' critique of Wakanda's isolationist inertia in the face of contemporary racism and post-colonialism. It's a shockingly bold move for the normally sociopolitically safe Marvel, but it pays off, making the brewing climax not only breathtakingly tense, but an impressively nuanced conversation on ethics, empathy, and the real impact of a contemporary revolution. You won't find that in Ant-Man. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, Coogler has his priorities straight, and Black Panther balances its political core with a raucously fun comic book ride. Aesthetically, it's a triumph - the FX, art, and costume design are flooring in their imaginative intricacy, incorporating Tony Stark calibre technology into traditional African designs and costuming (force field cloaks?! cool!), lending itself to a pragmatic sci-fi futurism unlike quite anything we've ever seen in the movies before, while the pastel hues of the 'spirit world' are jaw-dropping in their beauty. The fight scenes are thrillingly fun, balletic as they are brutal (and while T'Challa's new suit, and its explosive release of kinetic energy, adds a fun new level to the customary punching, kicking, and clawing, it's in the hands, spear, and wig of Danai Gurira's scene-stealing, steely general Okoye, that the film is at its most fun and thrilling), and Ludwig Gorasson's musical score, layering traditional African chanting and instrumentation into brassy superhero swells, is addictively sumptuous. There are occasional fumbles - Coogler's pace occasionally lags and sputters, with a more meditative second act verging on the lugubrious (and a couple of ""Remember who you aaaaaaaaare"" heart-to-hearts with John Kani's deceased patriarch that can't help but have their gravitas undercut by snickering comparisons to The Lion King). Still, Coogler sinks it home with furious aplomb, steering (just) clear of conventional Marvel third act ennui with a 'kitchen sink' climax so furiously tense and bonkers (two words: WEAPONIZED. RHINOS) that all cinema armrests will be marked with the claw marks of being gripped by a captivated audience. <br/><br/>As the titular monarch, Chadwick Boseman delivers a remarkably grounded performance. Steering the film with a regal calm undercut with muscular emotion and crucially accessible doubt, the film revolves around his steady, magnetic presence, as the showier, scene-stealing bits are commanded by the trio of powerful women ensconcing him (the perfection of Wright, Gurira, and the luminous, passionately charismatic Lupita Nyong'o). Martin Freeman's befuddled fed provides 'fish out of water' access to Wakanda with customary dry wit; he's fun without (quite) overstaying. Finally, Daniel Kaluuya, Forest Whitaker, and Angela Bassett all elevate one-dimensional secondary characters with gravitas and class, while Winston Duke's M'Baku is so ferociously terrifying mitigated by some of the most precise comedic timing seen in years, he damn near strolls off with the film himself. <br/><br/>A staggering accomplishment as fun as it is masterfully thoughtful, Black Panther may not quite settle into The Dark Knight territory of genre-transcending masterpiece, but it pounces proudly at its footsteps, this decade's 'thinking audience's blockbuster with a conscience' to beat. Soak in the well-deserved fun, and let the BET's 2010 cartoon theme triumphantly play me out: ""Black Pan-ther! Black Pan-ther!"" <br/><br/> -9.5/10"

I guess most of you have not noticed that it's normally swapped color schemes. I grew up with Marvel comics, they taught me to read. I had dyslexia, and the graphic novel was by far the best teaching for me... DC was boring. Maybe norms don't notice the color pallet in most movies either. I'm an old white guy. I noticed. I hate oppression, so it's a joy to see a movie whites don't dominate, whites don't replace other nationalities for our ""comfort"". I read the original black panther comic books. and they were a big deal at the time. All the good people in this movies defend human life without regard to race... not so the bad folks. Many of you roman empire folks want to see a roman win. I see a lot of folks who did not enjoy the comic books as kids, don't understand the ethic of superhero movies.

"invisibleunicornninja","6","3","10","18 February 2018"," Dumb yet entertaining...
","I went to see this movie with my friend in theaters without either of us knowing anything about the character. The biggest thing that took away from my experience of this movie was some a**hole who thought it would be a good idea to go on their phone during the climax and light up the theater. <br/><br/>In case you're reading this review before you watch, I'd like to let you know that there are two end credits scenes. If you like watching them, be sure to wait around until the very end. <br/><br/>This movie probably doesn't deserve the high rating I gave it, but I had a lot of fun watching. <br/><br/>Cinematography - The CGI in this movie was a bit inconsistent. Some scenes looked really fake while the majority was extremely well done. Most of the fight scenes were done very well, while others looked terrible (there was a fight scene at the beginning taking place in the middle of a forest that looked terrible). Overall, this was a very colorful and aesthetically pleasing film. <br/><br/>Characters - The acting was amazing all around, bringing these characters to life. Though most of the characters were intelligent, I did find The Black Panther's dad to be one of the most stupid and infuriating people to ever exist on this planet. Most of the characters had some kind of motivation for doing what they were doing, which just made them even more believable. <br/><br/>Plot - The plot was predictable. I i figured out the majority of the events before they even happened. Though I had a lot of fun watching this movie, the plot was pretty cliche and formulaic. There weren't too many character arcs and a movie that had so much potential fell a bit flat. There could've been more conflict and possibly some kind of internal struggle within the main character to make it more interesting, but for some reason they decided not to do that. <br/><br/>The Fight Scenes - Save for a few shots of your standard hyper edited Marvel movie fight scene bs, the majority of the fight scenes in this movie are well-choreographed. Despite there being no tension (because all the ""good guys"" are basically invincible) they are pretty fun. However, there is a scene where a woman gets her throat slit onscreen and there is no blood. There are actually a lot of scenes with people getting stabbed and there being no blood. This is a movie that will drop the f-bomb but avoid blood at almost all costs. You can't just pull a spear out of someone's abdomen and had it be shiny and clean THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS. <br/><br/>The Humor - The movie mostly fails at this. There are a few funny elements to this movie (like the leader of the mountain tribe) but most of the ""humor"" consists of outdated memes. There is actually a scene where a character makes a 4-year-old ""what are those reference"" and everyone in the theater cringed loudly (there were a lot of people in that theater). However, later in the same scene the same character is involved in a pretty funny gag where she kinda pranks The Black Panther by withholding information on his new suit. Like the CGI, the humor in this movie is inconstant in quality. <br/><br/>Technology - Unlike other movies with futuristic technology, all of the tech shown in this movie looked convenient and actually useful in some way. <br/><br/>Sound Design - The soundtrack for this movie was amazing (in my opinion) and unique. The sound design also helped with bringing to life this futuristic world. I have some hearing difficulties an usually have a lot of trouble understanding speech (at home I usually watch movies with the subtitles turned on) and especially people with accents different from my own, but at no point was I struggling to understand an English-speaking character in this movie. The music and background noise doesn't drown out the characters speaking. Also most everyone in the theater was polite enough to let everyone hear what was going on. I'm just mentioning all this because it was greatly appreciated. <br/><br/>I realize that not everyone is going to enjoy this movie like I did, and there are plenty of people who will get bored by the 2 hour+ runtime, but I was throughly invested for the entire duration of the movie. I believe I've explained my reasons. If you don't like Marvel movies, don't see it. If you think that a sci-fi superhero story with incredible new worlds and a fun story sounds interesting, go see it. <br/><br/>If you are someone who thinks that this movie is in any way trying to be political, I'd recommend that you go see a psychologist. There is nothing political about this movie. Its a fun dumb superhero movie with black main characters. I don't see why there are people using this movie in discussions about race."

","Black Panther starts out promising with acting by Michael B. Jordan, Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong'o and many more but unfortunately starts to fall flat like most film within the MCU. The problems with this film are the same with many others in the MCU, They go on for longer than they have any right to do. Very weird editing, cinematography and really bad CGI that we will all probably laugh at in 5 years time.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this film come when just over half way through ( I think, It feels like 2 hours in) they change the main bad guy to Jordan's character but it should have been him from the start and really didn't come as a shock when it happened because Serkis's character just feels weird in this film. <br/><br/>Overall, all the actors do great with a very standard Marvel Film."

"Dharya1997","9","7","33","16 February 2018"," The Most Relatable Marvel Movie I have ever watched
","I went into this movie, with a lot of background excitement. Although not in Hong Kong particularly, the buzz of this movie on Twitter was one that was overwhelming to be honest. <br/><br/>I think what I liked about the film in the beginning, is the way they connected T'Challa and T'Chaka in a deeper sense, when compared to the brief moment in Civil War. I think they truly gave Black Panther a good and proper origin, however it didn't feel like the one Dr Strange got in his own movie. This origin story, was more like experiencing T'Challa in depth after a brief and fast introduction in CA: Civil War.<br/><br/>Why I felt this movie was the most relatable MCU Movie, is because of the customs and the attire. As an Indian, born and brought up in India, some dressing sense and ornaments felt very known to me. For example, T'Challa in one of his scenes wears a clothing item, very similar to the Kurta (Search Google, basically an Indian long garment). Also, some rituals were something that I could easily make sense of.<br/><br/>After Loki, Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger felt like a really great villain in the MCU. I won't be spoiling his story, but one has to experience him on their own to know what I mean. His scenes are to watch out for, you would be greatly influenced by his character.<br/><br/>The women in this movie are a talking point on themselves,but two that caught my eyes were: Danai Gurira's Okoye and Letitia Wright's Shuri. Shuri, in particular, was one of favourite characters in the movie. Interestingly, Okoye and Shuri are two women in charge of defense and technological innovation respectively. I just felt, so happy that they portrayed both the physical and mental capabilities of the women. Saying any further will spoil the movie, so that's it.<br/><br/>However, the only reason I will give it a 9, is because the approach towards the climax, for me, felt a bit over-stretched. Otherwise, an all and all amazing movie, with a lot of socio-political facts surrounding it, that will be talked by generations to come by.<br/><br/>Hope this review was helpful.<br/><br/>Dharya P."

","First of all, let's start off by saying that I loved Black Panther. It was everything I wanted it to be and more.<br/><br/>The Pros are endless. The acting alone is worth notifying. Daniel Kaluuya, Andy Serkis, Letitia Wright, Martin Freeman, Forest Whitaker and Michael B. Jordan all do fantastic.<br/><br/>But it all really does come down to the performance of Chadwick Boseman as the Black Panther himself, doesn't it? I'l tell you what, he is stellar. His performance as T'challa is so subtle and so on point with the comics, which I'm a huge fan of.<br/><br/>Next up, the action scenes/directing. I could not be happier for Ryan Coogler right now, with this, Creed, and Fruitvale Station. I do have to say I was a bit dissapointed with the final fight, but that's mostly on the lighting team.<br/><br/>The story is great, the cast is great, the overall movie as a whole is great. I have but one flaw with it and this flaw could be considered a nitpick by many.<br/><br/>My flaw is that it does become the stereotypical marvel movie once in a while. There are certain character actions that wouldn't make sense in the actual tone that the movie presents us with, times where a character makes an unnecessary pun, and even an SUV chase towards the middle of the film.<br/><br/>I overall loved Black Panther. It has a very essential meaning to it that I personally think everyone will grasp hold of and also fun sequences that everyone will enjoy.<br/><br/>Black Panther gets an A or on an Imdb scale, a 9"

"stevendbeard","8","9","46","17 February 2018"," Loved This Movie
","I saw ""Black Panther"", starring Chadwick Boseman-Gods of Egypt, Draft Day; Michael B. Jordon-Creed, Fantastic Four_2015; Lupita Nyong'o-Star Wars:The Force Awakens, 12 Years a Slave; Danai Gurira-The Walking Dead_tv, All Eyez On Me and Andy Serkis-Star Wars:The Force Awakens, The Lord of the Rings movies.
This is based on a comic book hero that has been around since 1966, when he made his first appearance in a Fantastic Four comic. FYI: His debut was about 2 months before the militant Black Panther Party made their debut, so there was no connection between the two. Chadwick plays T'Challa, the son of the King of Wakanda, an East African country that is more than it appears to be. They have a precious metal called Vibranium that powers their whole country. They use it for all sorts of technological wonders; weapons, transportation, medicinal, etc. Vibranium can absorb and then refocus energy and it was even used in making Captain Americas' shield. When his father dies-as seen in Captain America:Civil War, Chadwick's first cinematic appearance-Chadwick returns to become King, and the new Black Panther, as was his father before him. That's when multiple problems start hitting the fan. First, Andy steals some Vibranium and Chadwick has to try and stop him-the policy of Wakanda is to keep their high technology a big secret from the outside world, so as to prevent misuse of the metal. Then Michael shows up, claiming to be the rightful heir to the Wakandian throne and challenges Chadwick to a fight. Lupita plays Chadwick's love interest and Danai is the head of security for Chadwick. Stan Lee pops up in his customary cameo-look for him in the casino scene-and there are 2 scenes at the end. The first is right after the end credits start and the second one is at the very end, so make sure you stay until the very end-it has a familiar character show up.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for action, violence and a rude gesture and it has a running time of 2 hours & 14 minutes.
As you might guess, I loved this movie and would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"andrijj","10","6","27","18 February 2018"," Absolutely loved it...
","Ignore the negative reviews... we all know the agenda of the vast majority of them. This is an awesome movie. I hope they do another at least a few more standalones with the Black Panther (versus a huge Avengers movie, where you can't get into the individual characters much at all). I wanted a lot more about this world and these characters! The fight scenes are awesome, the plot is interesting, the female characters rock, there are a lot of complex real-world issues raised. My only bummer was that they killed a character I really wanted more story from."
"asarhene12","10","10","54","17 February 2018"," If you're only interested in action sequences well...
","Here's the thing. The crux of most of this movie is the black experience told from various angles. If all you're interested in is fight sequences and cars blowing up, then this is not the movie for you. If you're interested in watching a story about abandonment, colonialism, nationalism, and other complex topics then this is the movie for you. If you are unfamiliar with the black experience and black culture then yes this movie may go over your head and you may view it as boring. I'm NOT saying this is only for black people, but to understand the essence of a complex movie like this you need to understand black culture and history. <br/><br/>I won't even get started on talking about how impactful this movie is for young black people to see themselves as heroes and as the majority and not the minority on the big screen, I'll be typing a whole dissertation lol.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty solid. Cinematography & wardrobe were fantastic. I really think the unsung hero is Winston Duke. He's got some great acting chops and a firm grasp on African mannerisms. I hope to see more of him soon. Other than that, it's a pretty solid movie and I'll probably see it again."
"Tkbn3812","9","7","34","18 February 2018"," The hype is very real for this both typical and different Marvel movie; go watch it!
","Black Panther has been one of the most anticipated movies of 2018, hype building up globally as the world waited for its release. Its near perfect score on Rotten Tomatoes has done nothing but exacerbate this hype, and I can confirm that the hype is definitely justified. <br/><br/>Black Panther probably won't start the conversations about race that some critics might have you thinking, but it's just such a tasteful, entertaining, unique movie that does so much more than your typical Marvel flick.<br/><br/>The film is set about a week after the events of Civil War, where T'Challa's father was killed at a bombing at a UN Convention in Vienna. T'Challa is still struggling to come to terms with the death of his father and the king of Wakanda, the setting of the entire film. It's this struggle that the movie focuses on at first.<br/><br/>The movie unfolds rather neatly, especially for a Marvel film, with the majority of the film centring in Wakanda. (Seems like Marvel's doing a lot more location centralisation; GOTG2 is mainly on Ego's planet, Thor: Ragnarok has a lot on Sakaar...it's better this way). <br/><br/>I think some of the key highlights of Black Panther have to be the characters. Chadwick Boseman shines as T'Challa; seriously, his silent bad-assery is stunning. Shuri, T'Challa's sister, is probably my favourite character in the film, she's just really funny and sweet. Nakia and Okoye are both very powerful female characters in the film, both taking their turns in guiding T'Challa in his times of need.<br/><br/>It's definitely the villain that many have really loved about this movie. Personally, while I loved Killmonger, I think maybe it would've been cooler if we got to delve a little more into his backstory and really understand his motives. Also, Claw is...just there...but when he is, he's fine. Martin Freeman returns as Agent Ross from Civil War, and while I'll readily admit I didn't need to see him back, it's nice to see him take on a bigger role in this movie as we delve more into his character.<br/><br/>I feel like Marvel movies are slowly becoming more and more grounded as Marvel mature, and that definitely shows in Black Panther. The film is easily their most mature film yet; Thor: Ragnarok is plain fun, Spiderman Homecoming is just another packed Spiderman film, but Black Panther feels very deep and important. It explores very important themes, that of race, of T'Challa's moral battles, the theme of leadership and monarchy...Marvel have proved time and again that a superhero movie can be a comedy, and now they've just proven they can also be something so much more meaningful.<br/><br/>You see, Black Panther is a very neat film. You can lose yourself in the stunning action of Avengers: Age of Ultron, but Black Panther will keep you engaged in its meaningful story, embroiled in its chief themes. All the characters shine as they deliver the movie's message about the challenges of being a leader, and the consequences of every action, big and small. I don't want to give the plot away, but its themes are what set it apart from any other Marvel film.<br/><br/>Now, I can't say it's a perfect movie. I did like Killmonger, but let's be honest; at the end of the day, he's just another Marvel villain. Basically that means he just feels like he's there...never much of a huge threat. (I mean we already KNOW that Black Panther survives already, we saw him in the Infinity War trailer!) It's basically the same feeling for Claw. There's also Killmonger's girlfriend who we never really get to see that much of, which is sorta a shame, I guess I can forgive that though.<br/><br/>Also, I think the soundtrack of this movie was a real highlight. I don't like trap music at all but I think it actually blended with this movie reasonably well. The soundtrack also sounded very traditional-African, especially given that Wakanda is a fake-country. That's actually one of the things you have to remember about this movie; it's as though it's trying hard to respect Wakandan culture, even though this culture is completely fictional. But hey, that's fine, right?<br/><br/>In the end, there's isn't all that much to fault about Black Panther. I think its themes are its real strong point. Okay, so while it's got powerful themes at the end of the day it's still a superhero movie, so don't expect to be blown out of your socks. But still, it's just got such great, well-rounded characters that you find yourself really believing in, and a very nice, neat story. If you watch any movie before summer ends (it's summer here in Australia), make sure it's Black Panther. Many critics have called it the best movie in the MCU; I might not go quite as far to make that claim, but it's definitely close. Go and watch it, and make the choice for yourselves."
"BFourTL","Null","7","34","18 February 2018"," Much more then just another Marvel Movie. Incredible
","Movie has a bit of everything for everyone from the music and the amazing cast, Chadwick Boseman, Michael B Jordan as well as the whole female cast were excellent. Really wanted more Killmonger, the screen time he did have was satisfying enough. They all rose above the need for constant action in a superhero film and actually carried the film well instead of the other way round. It was beautiful and grabbed me from beginning to end. Marvels greatest score so far? I Think so. I had been looking forward to Black Panther ever since I saw the first concept for his costume and it did not disappoint. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Glad to hear it could do $200+ Million opening weekend just to show these people hate will not stop this movie from being successful. We will combat your hate with Love and our wallets to show you the world will not be any scarier when Black Panther is a successful movie. Bring on Infinity War and Black Panther 2 +"
"gavinp9","8","7","34","15 February 2018"," Great balance of action, drama and visuals
","'Black Panther' is another solid Marvel film, but thankfully works as a standalone action film and family drama. T'Challa (Boseman) - first introduced in 'Captain America: Civil War' - becomes King of Wakanda (a fictional African country) and has to deal with the dual responsibilities of following traditions, keeping his family and country safe and being the Black Panther (basically Batman - rich guy who can fight good and has a good suit and gadgets). <br/><br/>There's a really great support cast - Killmonger (Jordon) as the long-lost cousin, Nakia (Nyong'o) as the ex-girlfriend/conscience, Okoye (Gurira) as his General, Ross (Freeman) as the CIA agent, Klaue (Serkis) as the mercenary, Zuri (Whitaker) as the shaman, Shuri (Wright) as his sister, Ramonda (Bassett) as his mum and W'Kabi (Kaluuya) as his best friend. However, Boseman really carries the film, with a lot of poise and calmness, but then extreme passion when needed. The plot's not too complicated and has an obvious ending, but the 2 & a quarter hours are well worth it.<br/><br/>There's plenty of stunning CGI (probably too much, since none of the film was actually shot in Africa, a big shame - feels like if they filmed in South Korea, they could go to Kenya or Zimbabwe for a few real-life shots), a good tribal-drum score, some great action scenes and plenty of hand-to-hand combat scenes too. However, at it's heart is a good story of responsibility and doing what's right over what's easy or the usual way."
"rannynm","9","6","28","16 February 2018"," Easily one of the greatest comic-book films I've seen!
","Black Panther is a stunning first solo outing for its title character that wowed me with its strong ensemble cast, inventive visuals and multi-layered story. <br/><br/>Black Panther follows T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), King of Wakanda, an advanced and highly powerful territory that is disguised as a third-world country. He also protects his nation and its people as a masked vigilante called the Black Panther. After the death of his father, T'Challa is chosen to take the throne and receive the powers of the panther god. Just after his extravagant coronation, a threat finds its way into Wakanda's borders by Erik Killmonger. Killmonger is a fierce and skilled soldier who wishes to replace T'Challa and usher in a new age for the country. T'Challa will be tested and must protect the throne from Killmonger.<br/><br/>My favorite character is Shuri (Letitia Wright), T'Challa's whizkid sister who helps him maintain the mantle of Black Panther and stay one step ahead of the villains he faces. Letitia Wright delivers hilarious one-liners with near perfect timing. She nails the rapport between Shuri and her brother, interacting in a way that is both believable and develops both their characters.<br/><br/>An outstanding performance in this film comes from Michael B. Jordan who is brilliant as Killmonger. He abandons the genre's usual vague ""destroy-the-world"" motivation and creates a genuinely complicated character. Jordan has cutthroat moments that make you dread his presence, but his sinister manner is evened out by moments where you come to sympathize with his character.<br/><br/>The deep, emotional part of the film's story is unexpected and caught me by surprise. It is an important moment for the main character and what drives his actions for the rest of the film. Sometimes, these comic-book heroes make poor decisions and have to fight against their own demons as well as the bad guys. This has been done before in both comics and film, but here we really see T'Challa change through his experiences. <br/><br/>I recommend this film to ages 12 to 18. There is some action and violence with spears and swords that feels more violent than what I'm used to from comic book films. I give it 4.5 out of 5 stars. Black Panther is easily one of the greatest comic-book films I've seen. Period.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org."
"TonyFranco64","8","6","28","16 February 2018"," Black Panther a movie with identity,
","A film full of culture, own style. A solid story; of political and racial conflicts. Visually beautiful, excellent costumes, Wakanda feels totally real and beautiful, the CGI of the film is excellent except in some places. 
Our characters are incredible: Lettita Wright as Shuri gives us that comic-sarcastic touch totally of the MCU, Lupita Nyong'o gives us a warrior totally loyal to her nation, Michel B. Jordan as Killmonger us one of the best villains of the MCU, with good motivations, which make the viewer doubt if in reality he is on a good path. Chadwick Boseman is excellent as Black Panther to whom we see him defending his nation, and upholding his beliefs and decisions.
In particular, the film is excellent breaking the mold of the latest films of the MCU, has a serious tone, action at the most, and a good subject to reflect.
The only bad thing about the movie is that at the beginning it feels a bit slow, but when it is introduced, the story catches you and has a good development."
"travishouze","8","6","28","16 February 2018"," ""Black Panther"" Comes With it's Sharpest Claws
","There are some movies than mean more than just entertainment or insight in ones life. There are certain films that spark phenomenons for certain cultures in unexplainable ways while still maintaining the intent for enjoyment for others. Black Panther emerged from the Captain America: Civil War film and gave the audience only a feeling of what to expect from the land of Wakanda, but also brought the audience even more than one would expect from a Marvel movie.<br/><br/>The film follows T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) as he takes the throne as king of Wakanda after the death of his father. As he returns home and settling within his position, he also comes across people who challenge his abilities as a king and the sins of his fathers past.<br/><br/>Ryan Coogler as a director really delivers a gorgeous movie (his third film so far, Creed & Fruitvale Station) and stage Wakanda beautifully from the world building to the eclectic costume design. The characters motivations feel sharper than ever, and never fears making references that make the audiences laugh and snap their fingers. Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) is one of the few MCU villains that has a believable motivation but a shockingly raw reason to his plan that many might find themselves asking the same thing.<br/><br/>While the cinematography can be really good at times, it can be shaky at moments as well. The very first fight scene takes place in the dark, and with the gunfire and fast cutting, it can be a little shaky on the eyes at times deciphering whats happening. Also the CGI in some points, particularly in a ""Coming to America"" style christening, I felt a little deja vu from old cutout characters from old video games. And while there's more than enough action to spare in this film, I could have used a little bit of space in between each action scene.<br/><br/>Black Panther nonetheless is still a very rousing kind of superhero movie that takes on a couple interesting themes. There's excitement, and really challenges the power dynamic when the shoe is on the other foot. Find the biggest screen you can and be ready to take a trip that you may not want to come back from."

"mcdowellac","10","4","16","18 February 2018"," Black Panther Review
","Spoliers ahead
First, let me say I did go into this film with very high expectations because of the hype surrounding the film, as well as the nature of what the film represented to a group of people. Most of all, because I'm a avid collector of comics books and black panther happens to be one those series that I collect. In general it is very hard for me to sit through a film adaption of a comic book and look at it from a objective point of view. I always find myself wanting to compare it to the source material, and normally I end up disappointed-not because the film is bad per se, but because it doesn't live up to my expectations. 
There have been very few films that have been point on that I've loved. Deadpool, Kickass, the Watchmen, and even though Logan wasn't the version of old man Logan I would of loved to see on the big screen, I loved that film as well. I could even appreciate some aspects of Christopher Nolan's version of Batman. But we're not here to talk about those films, this is about Black Panther. 
The film follows T'Challa as he steps into his role as king (I'll try hard not to put too many spoilers or story material in here for those who are still going to see it). The events of this film follow after Captain America civil war. T'Challa is back in his country Wakanda, fictional African nation that is described as the most technologically advanced place in the world. This is due to a very valuable and rare metal called vibranium. T'Challa's goal is to ensure that his people are safe and by doing this, he sets to continue to keep Wakanda a secret. T'Challa believes if the world knew how advanced Wakanda was and knew that they were storing the virabium then his people would surely be attacked by outsiders. 
Now, the villain of the film, Killmonger, who I won't go into specific detail about, is the opposite of T'Challa. He is a black militant. Actually, I'll even dare to say that he holds true to the real black panthers' (from the 1960's) way of thinking. Killmonger wants to not only take over Wakanda but he wants to use its advanced resources to do what others have done to his people. Colonize. He believes that the they should use Wakanda's technology to arm their people around to world to overthrow their oppressors and take over every other country. 
The story more or less revolves around this conflict of thinking. And while watching it I couldn't help but to think of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcom x. As well as Professor Xavier and Magneto whose ways of thinking we're based on the aforementioned. One wanted to take over the world or overthrow those who oppressed them/hated them. While the other sought to co-exist with those who were different from them-to show them over time that they were the same.
This is the stance the story pretty much takes and in the end, T'Challa agrees with Killmonger to an extent. Instead of taking over the world he wants to extend his resources by educating and building up black communities around the world. There are a lot of political elements thrown into the film that brush upon current issues. Past issues and reoccurring issues. And the director does an excellent job of building this into the film while making it entertaining for anyone to be able to enjoy. 
He also does a great job of showcasing black panther in a positive light. A hero who has his faults and fails at times but finds a way to overcome his doubts and weaknesses. He beautifully melds aspects of African culture into a fictional universe as well as properly represents the background characters as not just warriors, but also elegant and intelligent people. I think all of these things are not only true to the source material, but also important for other African Americans, especially those of a young age,
to see. It gives them something to be proud of. It gives them characters they can not only relate to, but look up to and strive to be like the powerful intelligent people that those actors were portraying. 
There were some minor things about the film that I thought could of been touched up on like the fighting, which I thought was a tad choppy at times especially towards the climax. And the cgi I felt could of been a little better especially towards the end when Black Panther and T'Challa was fighting. I also couldn't help but to think of he lion king at times during the film but again those were minor things to a film that I thought lived up to the hype it created. 
The movie was easy to follow even for someone who has not watched captain America civil war or read any of the Black Panther comic books. The plot was engaging and informing, and the people and culture were beautiful to watch on the big screen. There was a great mixture of action and comedy, as well as drama. In the end, it's a Marvel film, but definitely one of the better ones in my opinion. I would definitely recommend it."
"KateeAlyssa","9","5","22","19 February 2018"," A passionate film
","Right out of the gate, one of my favorite features of this film is how vibrantly colorful it is. So many of the MCU movies (and action movies in general) have a pretty dull color scheme with only the occasional pop of color. I enjoyed the large range of colors and patterns on display.<br/><br/>I liked that most of the plotlines in the movie focused on personal relationships, and that so many of them were familial. T'challa and Shuri's interactions were adorable.<br/><br/>Killmonger was an incredibly compelling and multi-dimensional villain.<br/><br/>The various interactions between Shuri, Nakia, and Okoye were wonderful. Their personalities and personal relationships with each other felt fleshed out.<br/><br/>The score for Black Panther was absolutely amazing.<br/><br/>There were only two things that bugged me:<br/><br/>1- Some of special effects did not look good and were in my opinion pretty noticeable. Such as, during T'challa's initial coronation ceremony, the crowds of people standing on the cliffsides didn't really blend well with the background. Several of the times that people got thrown during the final big fight scene weren't great either. etc.<br/><br/>2- I with they had shown or said what the consequences were for W'Kabi's actions. I would have liked to know if he was in prison (I assume so), if the people that followed his charge were jailed or not since they were just following his orders (since I got the feeling they would have followed his orders regardless of if they agreed and if they would be punished accordingly or if would be less harsh since it would be seen more as fulfilling their duty to follow W'Kabi.). Regardless of what happened to W'Kabi, I would have also like to see if there would be any hint of a chance for redemption since he had such close relationships with several of the main characters.<br/><br/>Regardless of these complaints, they weren't enough for me to knock off a star."

The movie starts in slow pace, but once the Killmonger gets introduced the story shifted into a fast pace momentum. Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa scores just like he did in Civil war. But the real performer - Michael B Jordan plays the brutal Killmonger steals the show especially in the climax area.<br/><br/>The movie is well balanced with right amount action and humor.

Sit back, relax, and read on as I help out with your movie going pleasures. <br/><br/>LIKES:<br/><br/>The Cinematography: A good hero movie requires good visuals to bring it to life, and Black Panther reigns supreme on this level. After some unique storytelling art at the beginning, the movie resorts to beautiful blends of real-life, breathtaking shots and impressive visuals. The movie drops you into what feels like a technologically advanced city, complete with James Bond like gadgets that feel super in themselves. Black Panther's camerawork is also very dynamic, energetic enough to increase the action, but contained enough to not leaving you nauseous or confused. <br/><br/>The Acting: Marvel movies sometimes tank in this section, but again Black Panther raises the bar on this level. Chadwick Boseman retains the regality of T'Challa from Civil War but adds more conflict and growth to the character as he struggles with the mantle of king. Michael B. Jordan comes back with a fire, once again showing that he earns his spot in Hollywood with an emotionally charged performance that seethes with that raw edge. Lupita Nyong'o brings the balance to the movie, portraying a character that acts as a solid bridge between all parties, keeping her dynamic performance balanced at the same time, while Danai Gurira grounds the characters down with her strong will and fantastic stage combat skills. Letitia Wright is the comedy of the film who has a fantastic delivery of the well-written lines this movie has. Almost all parties involved nailed their roles, with the chemistry between everyone favorably mixing to create what felt like a tribe. Fantastic job casting director. <br/><br/>The Comedy: Marvel is all about making you laugh, sometimes making that the focus of the film and other times as a nice add-on. Black Panther took the latter for me and was tastefully done to perhaps be one of the best executions of the Marvel Universe. In this darker movie, there is a lot of tension and raw nerves exposed in the Savannah drama, with many negative emotions running rampant like the predators of the plains. Yet, intermixed in this intensity is comedic gold, or vibranium in this case, well-placed to maximize laughs and clever to avoid the usual slapstick staleness that plagues most movies. This style of comedy didn't detract from the movie but added another layer to help reset the tension and keep you engaged in the movie from start to finish. Plus, you've got a nice combination of styles in store as well, so two thumbs up for that. <br/><br/>The Emotion in the Story: The movie does not have the most unique story, something hard to accomplish in this age of saturation. Yet this Marvel version of the Lion King is packed with so many moments to send one into an emotional fervor, sending you on a roller coaster ride of feelings. Black Panther will be inspiring to many, bringing approving claps and motivation to change the world. It's a moral filled tale that brings out the dynamic use of technology, the importance of family, and the dilemmas of a new king having to face. While I'm not the biggest supporter of dramas, Black Panther manages to make the drama feel less soap opera like that many movies fail to avoid. <br/><br/>The Ending: Many f Marvel's movies often fail to find that satisfying ending to conclude the awesome tale. Black Panther, manages to keep everything going from start to finish and brings all the building tension to full boil with an exciting climax. All the characters are brought into the mix, having some involvement in the conflict at hand, as they fight in impressive choreographed battles. And while our combatants dance in the virtual field, the story continues to progress and the characters develop with each swing of the weapon. It utilizes all the elements that they had developed during the movie, which goes to show story telling is still alive. <br/><br/>DISLIKES:<br/><br/>Impressionable Hate: More of a warning, the main villain is not only skilled and deadly, but has a surprising amount of hate contained in his chiseled body. Killmonger is a character that has a lot of issues, and his plot to change the world is something that can motivate impressionable minds down the wrong avenue. Be careful when taking friends and younger audience members to the film who have difficulty understanding character flaws. <br/><br/>Martin Freeman: The movie did an okay job with the former hobbit, but I expected a lot more from Freeman's character. Though there is some comic relief, and a little action with his character, Freeman really didn't feel that pertinent to the story until near the very end. Such a legendary actor deserved some more relevance to the plot, some extra comedy, or at least some better development to justify the price tag that comes with him. Not the weakest character mind you, but not what I expected. <br/><br/>More Action: No surprise, Robbie want's more action in his Marvel movie. With Black Panther, I had worried that most of the excitement was ruined in the trailers, especially with a huge gap between those action-packed sequences. Had it not been for the ending, I would have been disappointed in this quality, but still I wanted more to be unleashed in this movie to put T'Challa's skills to the test. <br/><br/>The VERDICT: <br/><br/> Black Panther is by far one of the better Marvel films to grace the theaters and shows promise for the future of the series. The tale has fantastic visuals to bring the world to life, alongside amazing writing and acting to further bring Wakanda to the playing field. It keeps its characters engaged and fills the 2-hour 15-minute run time with an emotional fervor to keep you integrated into every aspect until that incredible ending sequence. However, the movie still has a few limitations including needing a little more action, a dab more of Martin Freeman's relevance, and a slight decrease in predictability to make this a perfect film in the Marvel universe. Still, the film gets massive props for reviving the Marvel movement this year. So definitely get out there and see Black Panther and unleash the beast that dwells within all us comic book fans. <br/><br/>My scores are: <br/><br/>Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.0"

Black Panther was Marvel's 18th movie, but its release in 2018 made film history. Not only is it ranked the best Marvel movie according to Rotten Tomatoes, beating out Avengers: Endgame (2019), Iron Man (2008) and Thor: Ragnarok (2018) but Black Panther is one of the most successful movies ever with an African- American director and also a predominantly black cast. Other movies with a predominantly black cast include Moonlight (2016), Get Out (2017), and Love & Basketball (2000) but none have received the attention like Black Panther.<br/><br/>The film opens with a narration about how the nation of Wakanda came to be and why they have isolated themselves from the rest of the world. Wakanda is a fictional African nation known for its connection and source of vibranium and advanced technology. Many nations are trying to steal these resources from Wakanda so they live under an invisible shield.<br/><br/>T'Challa, the main character in Black Panther, lost his father in the movie Captain America: Civil War which means that he is next in line to become king of Wakanda and the new Black Panther. T'Challa now has to protect his people. He battles powerful enemies around the world with help from his people and their allies. The film is packed with fighting, love, honor, and family.<br/><br/>The plot deals with very strong and compelling themes including the role of women in the world, self-determination, and being African vs. being an ""outsider"". These themes are woven throughout the film and provoke the audience to think about these issues on a broader scale as they apply to our current society.<br/><br/>Black Panther also had an outstanding original soundtrack. All of the music in the film was composed by Ludwig Gogansson. Before the movie, he traveled to Africa to learn and research traditional Tribal music. The pieces that he put together created a very powerful soundtrack that went on to win Best Original Score at the 2018 Academy Awards and a GrammyAwards. Kendrick Lamar also created an album for this movie. His song ""King's Dead"" also won a Grammy. All of the original music written for this movie enhances the audience's experience, and it transports them to feeling like they are surrounded in the culture and at the battle scenes.<br/><br/>Another phenomenal part of this movie was the elaborate costume design by Ruth E. Carter and the beautiful make-up designs by Joel Harlow. There was a strict color palette of black, red, and green between the three main characters which often represent African nations. All of the dresses, crowns, and robes she designed were directly inspired by traditional African clothing. Joel Harlow spent hours researching traditional looks from African tribes. After that he had to create five different styles for the five different tribes of Wakanda. Harlow had intense detail on the characters including attaching individual scars all over Michael B. Jordan. Both the makeup and costumes were so important to the movie's impact because it transports the audience to feel as if it truly could have been filmed in a real nation in Africa.<br/><br/>The one critique that I have about the film is the actor's accents. I fully understand the purpose was to create a more authentic feel for the setting. However, I believe at times during the story it was distracting and made me lose track of the dialog between characters.<br/><br/>Overall, I would 100% recommend this film to anyone who loves a fast paced storyline with relatable characters. Despite Black Panther being a favorite Marvel movie among Superhero fans, I think it's biggest impact besides being highly entertaining is that it forces the viewer to think about gender and race in a new way."

","""After the brief but strong performance of Black Panther during the outstanding Captain America: Civil War, MCU scheduled the right steps to build-up this African-beloved world which has all the potential to become a great franchise, just as Nolan's The Dark Knight""<br/><br/>Spider-Man and Black Panther were gigantic surprises because, after a decade, one superhero could join the MCU and the other gave a new perspective of the African Continent which was something genuinely innovative. What makes the film so special (taking into account the prestigious cast, the well-developed villain, the beautiful imagery, and many other qualities) is the mixture of cultures, never leaving the influence the environment had within it. The film innovates the superhero world after a decade of US and UK origin storyline, finally, we can afford to do so in a spectacular way, I swear this will be an iconic origin story to a bunch of new-generation flicks. Practically, I took off my hat after watching it because it signified two positive points: a) Marvel golden years are still there (since 2016 Captain America: Civil War) and, b) The film brings back forgotten characters of the MCU and moulds their appearance while expanding their complexity (take the example of Ulysses Klaue, haven't heard of that folk since 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron). When stating the performances, everyone plays a key role and does it perfectly, my personal favourites were the main villain Killmonger, who turned out to be the third best villain I have seen in the MCU; Shuri, who is an exceptionally-awesome sister, and Nakia performed by the fisrt-class-talented Lupita. Finally, but not least, there is so much going on! For example, the action pieces entertain the audience as long as you could imagine, because they are set and dynamically prepared, then, the characters' development, it constructs Killmonger's profile and builts it, in order to present a final setup.<br/><br/>It is difficult to find some defects, nevertheless, I considered the CGI a little exaggerated, while the comedy side was lacking a little bit... (85/100)"
"tkbludis","9","2","6","19 June 2019"," Another great MCU film! But the some of the CGI is awful
","Black Panther is really good. The story is great, the characters are well written, and Kilmonger is my third favorite MCU villain behind Loki and Thanos. I liked how serious this film actually was as well. However some of the CGI particularly toward the final battle looks HORRIBLE. Some of the CGI looks almost as bad if not worse than the CGI in Justice League. And I didn't like the ""what are those"" joke. But overall, Black Panther is another great MCU film."

"junshiwilda","8","2","6","16 June 2019"," 👍( Oscars 2019 reviews #3) Not Best Picture worthy, but let's just chant Michael B Jordan forever!
","Black Panther is perhaps the most surprisingly hyped movie of all time. It holds a 98% on rotter tomatoes where actual big name film critics like Peter Travers gave this full stars. It was nominated for 7 Oscars including Best Picture and won 3 making it the film that won the most Oscars just behind Bohemian Rhapsody. If you ever read any of my reviews you will probably know I always use Black Panther as a scapegoat, but I actually am giving this a positive review. Though I believe this is a good movie I still don't believe this deserves Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>Black Panther is perhaps one of the more distinct movie inside the MCU. It follows a shakespearien story structure rather than a MCU origin story template like movies such as Doctor Strange. I was able to have a very fresh experience to watch a movie that is not a formulaic superhero origin story. The action sequences were excellent especially the casino fight scene which was the stand out scene for me. But the secret sauce that makes this movie work is Killmonger played by Michael B Jordan. This villain is written very well in a way I actually rooted for him more than the main protagonist. His motivations are very compelling and his background is tragic which makes you care for him more than any other character in the movie. If there is one thing the Oscars should have nominated from this movie it is Michael B Jordan for Best actor in supporting role. He did an amazing job it certainly deserved Academy attention. That would be the only Oscar nomination I actually can understand.<br/><br/>As many point out the big problem in the movie is the special effects. I was very surprised to see this film was nominated for Best Visual effects since especially in the third act it was pretty clear it was shot entirely in a green screen. As much as I liked Killmonger I thought he should have been developed over a longer period of time. Until the third act he is just a random guy blowing things up and if they were developing the villain's background and motives I think Killmonger could have been way compelling than he was in the movie. It felt like the screen writers jammed in Killmonger's background story in the very last minute because they were too lazy writing a character arc from the start to the finish of the movie. But that doesn't take away the fact that Killmonger is a very good villain though he deserved to be developed over a longer period of time. The humor kind of felt forced a bit compared to other MCU films, but come on! There still is some very hilarious moments.<br/><br/>Overall this is a movie that is very good but still pretty overhyped. Inside all of the Best Picture nominated films of 2019 this is the one I do not understand at all. It was a enjoyable enough movie but Best Picture out of all the great films that came out this year is pretty bizarre. Even Vice, a movie I gave a lower score than this I think had something that stood out, but Black Panther was just another standalone superhero film with nothing that was outstandingly good. Mark my word this is another distinct and unique movie inside the superhero genre, but if that's the case shouldn't the Oscars nominate every single movie inside the MCU where diversity in genres exist? The big reason why this movie is nominated according to critics is because this movie is lead entirely by people of color, but I think that is a pretty disgusting way to discuss film. It feels like the MCU producers went to the Academy asking them to nominate one of their films, and the Academy decided to nominate Black Panther solely because that was the only movie that followed their American leftist agenda. But I still think this is a movie that has more positive than negative aspects. As I said over and over Michael B Jordan gave a amazing performance as Killmonger and it is a performance that is the best ever since Heath Ledger's Joker. The Academy should have taken away all of the 7 nominations just to only give out the nomination for Best Supporting Actor for Michael B Jordan. Though I initially gave this a 7/10 I am pretty confident this will turn into a 8/10. Yes this is not Oscar worthy, but this deserves a higher rating than all of the 7/10 popcorn entertainment movies out there."

"tabuno","8","2","6","4 May 2019"," A Step Towards A Culturally Sensitive Superhero
","This predominately African American superhero blockbuster attempts to break into the cultural diversity genre and offer up a more emotive, thoughtful collision between good and evil. In many ways it succeeds, yet it remains to be seen whether the depiction of African Americans are truly authentic and innately faithful to respecting cultural differences. There are suggestions that, like its stereotypical predecessors popularized for the Western audience, liberties may have been taken. There are several weaknesses in two of the early fight scenes that seem to be more for the screenwriter's convenience to move the storyline along rather to offer a more convincing display of intelligent preparations for combat. The male dominated action scenarios continue with some effort to provide some balance to the violence inherent in action-thrillers. What makes this superhero movie stand out a bit from the rest is its attempt at a humanistic theme that emerges in places but doesn't quite fulfill the potential of a truly classic movie of real depth. In some ways, this movie reflects the current political turmoil in America today as good and evil are on display in the morality of what a Country stands for. Black Panther results in a good effort that sustains interest and incorporates the requisite elements for a superhero movie and includes a bit more thoughtfulness."

"meeshoffmanns","9","2","6","6 March 2019"," The Best and most Relevant Comic-Book movie that has ever been put to Screen
","I was already a big fan of Chadwick's take on the Black Panther in Civil War, and after seeing the trailer, it was clear that this movie embraced it's African root's to the fullest, which is a side we so rarely see that that alone was enough to make me want to see it. I was not disappointed; I was impressed beyond belief: This is by far the most mature and relevant movie Marvel has ever made.<br/><br/>Acting:
Chadwick Boseman returns as T'Challa in a subtle yet very impressive performance, delivering a wide range and intensity and realism all at once. Not oscar-worthy, but if he were nominated, I wouldn't have protested.<br/><br/>Michael B Jordan gives us the best MCU villain yet, with an emotional and relatable background, in a strong performance(not without it occasionally being too over the top)It is clear that he worked hard on this character, and his character is in a way the soul of this movie.<br/><br/>Lupita Nyong'O as Nakiya is a role you wouldn't expect to like as much as you should. Her character is mainly the love interest, but her morals and wisdom and skillset, supported by Lupita's subtle performance make her a very likable character.<br/><br/>Letitia Wright as Shuri is absolute gold(or vibranium?). She and Chadwick have a hilarious and believable chemistry as brother and sisters, and her big ammunition cache of sass and big brains make her a great asset to an already great cast.<br/><br/>Winston Duke as M'Baku is another big surprise: his powerful performance as the tribal leader of the Jabari is one of the best supporting roles I have seen in a long time, and Winston provides both humor and sheer intimidation with excellence.<br/><br/>Sterling K Brown as N'Jobu is excellent, giving a very realistic and raw performance as a broken and conflicted prince, and might be one of the best actors in this movie.<br/><br/>Andy Serkis seems to have a blast in his role as Klaue, but to me he is having a bit too much fun. It very soon becomes over the top, and although he is ruthless and occasionally funny, he can feel like a bit of a sore thumb.<br/><br/>Daniel Kaluuya and Danai Gurira are both great supporting characters as W'Kabi and Okoye, and although their character arc is a great watch, it could have been explored better than we get to see in the theatrical cut. Both deliver subtleness and intensity at a great balance.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman and Forest Whitaker play their part and do that well most of the time, but you can't help but notice that Martin could be written much more layered and interesting than what he is given to work with here. I like him more as a Hobbit.<br/><br/>Direction:
Ryan Coogler deeply impressed me with Creed, and it is great to see that something vastly different like a big comicbook-movie fits him just as well. He directs great action sequences and emotional moments, and truly transcends all the directors that have come before him.<br/><br/>Cinematography:
While Marvel is known for their pretty bland use of camera, this is clearly the best shot movie thus far. Tracking shots, creative spins and wide establishing shots are put to great use here, though the use of color could still be perfected.<br/><br/>Plot:
After a great introduction, the pacing suffers a bit in a section through Korea, but improves again vastly back in Wakanda. This is a really smart movie, partially presented through it's relevant themes like colonialism and slavery, and political isolationism. The cast translates these themes perfectly through grounded yet effective dialogue, and good use of flashbacks and creative exposition early on.<br/><br/>Editing:
Nothing much to note here, standard MCU cutting of story. A lot of good deleted scenes were left out, which is a bit of a shame.<br/><br/>Music:
Ludwig Göransson won the Oscar for this score, and he absolutely deserves it. I rarely come across a soundtrack that is as rousing and involving in every track it has as this one. Ludwig involved traditional African instruments, combined with standard orchestral sounds and modern electronics to create a unique and wonderful blend of superhero music, which is the best from Marvel yet.<br/><br/>Costume Design and Make-up:
Oscars were also won for these, again well deserved. The traditional African garbs and face/body-paint are wonderful to look at and give a deep sense of culture and history to Wakanda.<br/><br/>CGI:
A point that many people complained about. While I agree that this is far from the best CGI that Marvel has to offer, I think it is a lot of way too harsh judgment. A lot is still very impressive, particulary the vibranium mine and the Korea chase.<br/><br/>Tone:
The standard humoristic tone of the MCU is everpresent, but slightly better thanks to Coogler's writing, with Shuri and M'Baku delivering a lot of well-working levity in surprisingly somber scenes. The dramatic scenes themselves are some of the most powerful in all of MCU history, and there is a high chance of tear-shedding in some of them.<br/><br/>Overall Concensus:
Thank's to Ryan Coogler's creative hand, the faith of Marvel Studios and a fantastic cast, Black Panther succeeds in its goals and beyond, delivering the best superhero movie I have ever seen. 8.8/10"

"jcosully","7","2","6","22 October 2018"," A visually stunning and culturally aware Marvel Movie
","Black Panther stands out from all of the other MCU entries by taking a deep dive into culture, and making a villain who isn't necessarily the bad guy. Everyone on the cast does a really great job of bringing the characters to life. They aren't two-dimensional, and have rich backstories, that aren't cliche. My favorite part of this movie has to be Micheal B. Jordan as Killmonger. He does a really good job of portraying someone who has dealt with a tremendous loss in thier life, and is fueled by grief and rage. It's nice to see a villain who isn't really a villain, just a person who is doing bad things, but for (to some) good reason. The film itself is visually stunning, with long drawn out scenes of sunsets, and skylines. Unfortunately, the green screen effects don't always work, and that is a big disappointment, especially when some of the scenes are breathtaking. I personally don't love the films ending, but that didn't really make the movie any less enjoyable. This is one of my favorite Marvel movies so far."

","Yes the spoiler show because many fans are a little bit disappointments , I love very entire main casts; Chadwick Boseman, Danae Guira, Winston Duke, Michael B jordan, Angela bassett, Lupita Nyong, Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis and Letitia Wright in movie; great fascinating actions including director. I understand the main villain killed off film pissed fans of marvel. But sentimental for many people show T'challa more moral. Fans need see more connection with Erik which true. The problem is political in Africa show many royalty of throne have more power rule by monarch representing Republican. I really love movie end seems bittersweet and tear jerking. The movie inspire the Lion King but it show more political movements. Movie part killed main off pissed me a little bit. It show film overrated and hype. Movie show more appreciated culture originated Africa and racist crime of white. The main character T'challa I admire is very kind and ruthless with loving family.; he seems very forgiven, caring, benevolent and sympathetic;. Main villain; Klaws( Andy Serkis) and Killmonger ( Micheal B Jordan) are great; Killmonger show more tragic villain connection past of T'challa's family. Reviewer are anger of T'challa killed of Avenger Infinity War pissed many fans off because of worst villain Thanos; don't worry about- Captain Marvel save world. I never seen and read comics of movie adaption. Many fans are disappointing to see Man- Ape connection and Sebastian Stan's White Wolf and Killmonger connection resurrection more like Loki. OK honestly Black Panther are one first Originated African hero in Marvel portray overrated antihero; yet after year he can be a little but ruthless show more political situation. In comic, in day, he join many teams like Fantastic Four and Avenger and Illuminati to fight evil. Missing part; the not cloak yet show- cross your finger. Like Batman, both are stoic and multi billionaire and dark hero with cloak in comic with black suits. T'challa genuinely does care many people like family that he show helping other as well and on other hand; Batman show helped isolated but difficult issues get along well other JLA. Differently, in comic, Bruce real; family and show care other people; in 1930s."

","I dislike movies which are made just to make a quick buck. This is what Black Panther is as a movie. The infamous comic book hero who was for many decades a side story to other super heroes. The creators of this movie could have done better but they dropped the ball.<br/><br/>As I watched the first few minutes of the movie and the dialog started to move forward, I realized the entire movie and how the ending was going to take place. I could see the deliberate conflicts and who would later become the antagonist. Actually there were several of them, but there is a main one who goes to the very end of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is completely superficial. The script lacks any depth. The characters are hollow. The plot is predictable.<br/><br/>The only thing worth my time was the special effects and even that was restricted to a select number of scenes.<br/><br/>Physics were ignored. Character development was tossed. Realism took a back seat to special effects.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is blah. It's supposed to be full of color and excitement but I couldn't wait to get out of the theater. A complete disappointment."
"tudorpsih","2","2","6","7 September 2018"," Just no.
","Apart for the current MCU fever and the political climate, I don't get why this movie gets this much praise.
With lackluster CGI, a lot of continuity errors and character inconsistencies, this movie wouldn't stand out in any other decade. 
There are better movies that touch on the african culture (Tsotsi, Hotel Rwanda), better action movies (most MCU movies, the recent Mission Impossible ones) and more compelling portrayals of heroism that touch on the minority aspect of society (Boyz n the Hood, Dope) that don't require fantasy elements.
The villain was better than in most previous MCU movies, but the writers still didn't give him anything with gravitas, for T'Challa to rise to the challenge in a memorable way.
If we weren't living in a society that imposes race as a stand-alone quality of a person, this movie would've been forgotten in a couple of weeks."

","To be honest, I am rather baffled that there are critics who are hailing this film as a cinematic masterpiece and one of the if not the best superhero movies ever made. I sometimes wonder if I even watched the same movie they did. Even with that said, I still thought that this was a really good movie and I had a fun time watching it in the theater.<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman is quite good as the Black Panther, bringing the right blend of confidence and emotion to the character. There are many supporting characters who are quite interesting as well. I was skeptical about Michael B. Jordan playing the villain of the movie, but he did a surprisingly decent job.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie by far is its world-building. Wakanda is a wonderfully fleshed-out setting, and the gorgeous cinematography really sells the beauty and grandeur of it.<br/><br/>The story is interesting and filled with intriguing commentary, with it only occasionally feeling preachy. The action scenes are a lot of fun, with the car chase being my favorite. I also liked the final battle.<br/><br/>It does have some problems, though. The film dragged in some places and was overlong, and there were some instances where the CGI looked too obvious. The worst thing about this film by far is Martin Freeman's character. He had no real impact on the story and was kind of embarrassing to watch.<br/><br/>All in all, this was another strong addition to the MCU. Even if it is overhyped and overrated, I still really like it. Check it out.<br/><br/>RATING: B+"

","As much as the Marvel Cinematic Universe has a consistently good track record with each entry that has scored good rating even it has its flaws and error yet Black Panther truly soars as a unique superhero film that blends well with artistic styles, great action as well a great story that takes inspiration and similarities from the Shakespeare's Hamlet as well elements from The Lion King and its political narrative from the underrated The Last Samurai. Clearly, the screenplay by Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole was truly a great story and the most unique and intriguing pieces of cinema. Even Ryan Coogler's sensible, intense, stylistic and realistic direction and storytelling which draws its similarities to Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins as well Ryan Coogler's aesthetics to his previous films such as Fruitvale Station and Creed truly makes this film unique and compelling.<br/><br/>What makes Black Panther one of the best films of 2018 was the great, compelling and memorable performances from the ensemble cast which singles out Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Guirira, and Letitia Wright as one of the major stand-outs. This is also a major milestone for cinema to featured black actors and actresses as the main cast which signals a good step in a right direction for representation and diversity as well creating a cultural phenomenon just like what Wonder Woman has achieved for in its major representation for women. Even the breathtaking cinematography, production and costume designs also makes it a great experience and a feast to the eyes.<br/><br/>Just like every film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Black Panther also had its flaws, mostly the CGI effects which was noticeable and has its issues on pacing but nevertheless Black Panther will be no doubt serve in its place as one of the greatest superhero films in cinema history alongside The Dark Knight, Superman (1978 film), and Wonder Woman and has also further transcended the superhero genre in a whole new level as well cemented its cultural and iconic legacy."

","Black Panther is a generic super hero semi sci-fi grounded on earth featuring the offbeat casting of an all black cast in the first feature of another Star War's franchise. With it's pacifist warrior lead (Chadwick Boseman) it offers up a less stoic more in touch with his feelings super hero that resonates beyond the action with underlying statement but ultimately relies on it's bread an butter action to seal the deal.<br/><br/>Oakland gang banger and rightful heir to the throne of Wakanda, C'halla, is recalled to his country to take up the crown and deal with a crisis involving vibranium, the key to the country's incredibly advanced society. C'halla would like to promote the technology to help oppressed people throughout the world but it has fallen into the wrong hands and his attempts to retrieve it are being distracted by challengers from the throne; first from the imposing mountain people and then a crass one man war machine from the USA by the name of Kilmonger (Michael B. jordan). Kilmonger is no pretender to the throne however and is allowed rightful challenge to the crown.<br/><br/>Panther breaks no new ground as the first all black Hollywood production but it certainly is a step forward in the evolution of the black film in Hollywood from the well intentioned Halleluah (29) to the talent laden Cabin in the Sky ( 43) to the abysmal The Wiz. Unlike the cliches, the patronizing and mocking (in the case of The Wiz just an incredible waste of talent) Black Panther maintains its dignity from end to end but most importantly offers a welcome twist to the Marvel franchise to film in setting, character and plot.<br/><br/>Boseman is an approachable an amiable breath of fresh air without the stilted stoicism as the super hero, his actions involving a lot more familial activity with a precocious sister to play off as well as have a partner with a backbone. This well grounded humanity may serve him well in future episodes, creating problems and missteps on his part, causing him to drop his guard when it calls for steel resolve, enabling for chaos and confrontation and allowing the action fantasy film to do what it does best in this age of technology, speed, blowing things up and super human effort in making the Universe a better place."

","It was mostly good, the action, acting, effects were all great, and the story was... mostly good. And as a history nerd, I love that Black Panther can pique the audiences' interest in the under-studied- but fascinating- African history! 
The story's logic, though, fell short regarding secret-keeping of Wakanda's technology:
-Why didn't they take Killmonger back to Wakanda after his father died? Wouldn't leaving him abandoned make a secret-revealing nemesis out of him? (Also, where's Killmonger's mother? Would she also have known about Wakanda's secret but also left untouched?)
-And the big high-tech action scene in South Korea would've easily exposed Wakanda tech to the world, topped with pedestrians broadcasting the whole thing on social media!
-And the biggest issue is Jabari! For millennia, they distrusted using Wakanda tech, mildly antagonist to Wakanda but ultimately harmless to them, and yet kept in the cover-wall of high-tech Wakanda? Realistically, anytime Jabari would've had a leader or two reveal the ""threatening Wakanda"" to outside neighbors- and knowing the inner workings of Wakanda's defenses- build a coalition to invade, conquer and/or destroy the high tech. It seems too unrealistic that they'd remain the cranky, reclusive hillbilly cousins all this time.<br/><br/>But other than that, it was very good!"

"valen060","8","5","23","19 February 2018"," Glimpse Into Wakanda. Left In Awe
","I'm at a loss for words that I can't even phrase them out carefully.<br/><br/>While the story may somewhat fall short (it does share a few parallels to 'The Lion King' when observed carefully), it makes up for it with an interesting cast performance done by Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman, and Letitia Wright, the visual setting also feels so immersive you'd think you're actually there. Notably, Freeman's character Everett Ross began to slowly remind me of Clark Gregg's Phil Coulson, but toned down in a different approach for humor. Not to mention the blend of traditional tribal music and an appealing soundtrack by Kendrick Lamar compliments both dramatic and intense scenes respectively.<br/><br/>Two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, T'challa (Boseman) is chosen to succeed his late father by naming himself as King of Wakanda. Things drastically change when old wounds open from his father's past.<br/><br/>After seeing Marvel's previous outing Thor: Ragnarok months back (which relied so much on a comedic approach), Black Panther is definitely a solo film that can hold its own with less humor and its blend of intricate action and drama. I mean based on the flashbacks and despite the intentions T'challa and Killmonger (Jordan) each had for the good of Wakanda, I couldn't help but pity their own respective causes. The former has his ideals and is about being virtuous by working hand-in-hand with their outside allies. Whereas the latter's intentions are morally unjust due to his own troubled past. It's completely understandable but for the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>I will say that it's not entirely perfect, but it was more than enough to keep me enthralled at what Black Panther can do."

When is it okay to question authority? your mentor? your parent? All smoothly admixed with stunning visuals, awesome action scenes, and a touch of humor. The costumes are unique and beautiful on all genders. And the prominent and integral role of the women is impressive, especially for an action movie. The 4DX platform is icing on the cake.

Michael B Jordan is phenomenal as Erik Kilmonger, he is (in my opinion), one of the best Marvel villains in a while.

Keeping in context this a fantasy superhero film then I feel it deserves every last one of the 10 stars. I hope MCU continues to develop this character and continues to offer the world yet another perspective on what a superhero can be and continue to nurture and develop this character and storyline with the same depth and compassion presented in this film. A superhero can be badass and also have compassion as one their super strengths...which in today's world actually is a super divine power since it seems to be lacking in many.

","I am not a Marvel fan, but I can enjoy most Marvel movies. After I read the reviews and saw the nominations of this movie i was actually for the first time since Avengers 2 interested in a Marvel movie. However after about 15 minutes in the film i started to feel, that all the reviews and nominations were probably not for an artistic reason.<br/><br/>I have three central problems with the film:
1. It is full of CGI
2. I do not care about the characters
3. There is nothing new about the story<br/><br/>I - CGI
There might be no other Marvel movies with that amount of CGI. The backgrounds, the suits, the weapons, everything shines and is clean. Yes some of it is not CGI, but even the practical effects and the real suits look like out of the computer. Of course this is a modern society, but i think african savannah would still leave some trace on all that fancy stuff. I generally thought this was a very ugly movie, only the mountain tribe looked interesting to me.<br/><br/>II - Characters
Okay, they tried to give Killmonger a good backstory. That worked for me fine, but while he has this tragic story, you make him also look like the most arrogant guy in the world. He claims to fight for the innocent yet he brags about how many of them he killed in unjust wars. And Black Panther basically becomes a guy who's only motivation is to be a good king. He has however no clue how to achieve that. In one scene he wants to only act in Wakanda, in the next he basically destroys big parts of Busan. I in no second cared about him. There are so many ""cool"" side characters, that you can not focus on one of them or on the main characters. In the end i don't care about who dies and it fits that Martin Freeman does not die even though he decides to sacrifice himself, because if he would have died there would have been one character that actually lost something.<br/><br/>III: Story
Everything in this movie has already been on screen for 100 times. A young king gets replaced by an evil family relative and decides to take the throne back with the help of some half-outlaws (that obviously refuse to fight because they could not be a Deus Ex Machina if they would not). You may love the movie, but no one can actually say that this story is innovative in any way. I was bored for most of the movie.<br/><br/>At last two small things:
Why do they speak bad english in Wakanda even though they were never an english colony?
Why are african and afro-american culture mixed. Why do we need american rap in Africa??"

"brucewadsworth","6","1","2","14 June 2019"," Upsettingly Wasted Potential, But Important Nonetheless.
","Black Panther is an important film. There's no denying this - The relevance of it's diverse and inclusive cast in a whirlwind of superhero movies that are some of the most seen and highest grossing films of the past decade (as well as being launchpads for a million different toys, models, figures sold across the world) is something you have to take into consideration when looking at this movie.
Objectively, this is a really entertaining watch! As with most marvel movies of late, much of the fight choreography is exciting and different, and the movie in general is... mostly well acted. Standout performances by Danai Gurira and Michael B. Jordan have to be mentioned; both actors play their parts with genuine sincerity, and add weight to a fairly lofty story (especially in the wake of 'more relevant to the MCU' films such as Civil War). Chadwick Boseman reprises his role as Black Panther from CW, but seems to float through this film with little direction? Obviously as an origin story of sorts, this makes sense, but CW introduced Black Panther PERFECTLY, so its odd that in his own film he holds so much less gravitas on screen. This, I believe may be down to one of my 2 major issues with this film: the script.
When I first watched this film, I found the pacing a bit clunky, and thought maybe the editing is abit choppy? Perhaps the actors are struggling to keep up with the narrative? But on rewatch, it occurred to me the script is confused. It simply cannot hold drama and comedy on its shoulders the way films like Infinity War did. Shuri is perhaps the most tired use of the Marvel comedy formula seen in one of these films yet - 'What are those!' was already an outdated meme by the time the film released, and is PAINFUL to hear. On the other hand, Killmonger's dying monologue by the sunset over Wakanda about his ancestors dying at sea on slave ships, is one of the most poignant moments in the entire MCU. How did they tonally screw this film so hard? Why was Martin Freeman in this film as unneeded, and unfunny comic relief? The script tries so hard in some places, but feels like a total afterthought in others. This, funnily enough paralelles my other main gripe with this film: The CGI.
Oh dear. When the universally unloved Spiderman 3 from 2007 has a far better looking subway fight scene than a larger franchised multi-million dollar blockbuster from nearly a decade its former, you know you've done something wrong. The film opens with quite a stunning credits sequence, stylised and detailed it gives you the sparknotes version of Wakanda and the Black Panther's history. Then Black Panther and Killmonger fight near some trains and good grief it looks BAD. 2 rubber men flung about on a green screen in a dimly lit cavern with nothing going on in the background. The choreography struggles here too, and considering this was the same year as Dr Strange? It's completely pitiful. Some of the absolute worst CGI Marvel has offered paying audiences in this decade (looking at you too, Homecoming).
Overall Black Panther does have a lot of merit. Like I mentioned, the importance of such a diverse blockbuster phenomenon is so great for representation in 2016. For others, the script will have been entertaining, and not everyone will notice the dreadful inconsistencies with the CGI. I can understand the high praise this movie got (Okay, maybe not 3 oscar noms worth, seriously?) But for me personally, these issues stuck out like a very sore, cat scratched thumb, meaning I cant give it more than a 6 and a half out of 10.
Oh, and Andy Serkis is here, doing his crazed Andy Serkis routine. Yeah."

","I did not watch this when it first came out as I was behind in my Marvel flix and needed to catch up. One day me and my wife decided to take the long road through all the Marvel movies starting with ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" and based on timelines on various fan sites trudged through them one by one... then came Black Panther. When it ended my wife and I dutifully watched the end credits to catch the ""hints"" to whats coming up. When it was all over silence fell in the lounge room. Neither one of us said anything. I then muttered ""did that seem a bit political to you?""...that opened the flood gates. When a new evil King took over and others were left with the decision to follow or defy...of course the cool ones opposed that King. The Marvel ""resistance"" was born...here we go again. There is no other way to put it, but Marvel went Spike Lee on this one and that made it so hard to follow in some scenes and easy to predict in others. Of course factional oppressed forces join to overthrow/defeat the evil King and his evil agenda...Marvels version of the ""25th Amendment"". In the end the it may have been possible to save the Evil King but he chose death to honor slaves the died sailing to their new Plantation we have come to know as America. A bold statement on its own but it gets lost in the myriad of subliminal and overt political statements spattered throughout the whole movie. We watched this movie because we wanted to be entertained...and that did not happen. Being a fairly switched on minority that has chosen to map out my own destiny in life... hearing the words ""Great, another white boy for us to fix""...left me shaking my head. Such potential lost..."

","Was a good movie. Entertained me, some nice action and comedy. I liked the vast majority of the characters and the acting. I thought the story was actually quite good too.
What I didn't like:
1) Way too much CGI. There's no reason why the developers could not have had martial artists in the Panther suits for the fight scenes. That would have been awesome but instead they opted for CGI characters and the CGI wasn't that good.
2) Not even a basic explanation as to how an ancient tribe managed to harness the technology of the vibranium meteorite. Iron Man is awesome because we know how the suit came to be. Similarly with Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow etc. That's what adds so much more to a story yet here we're supposed to believe that ancient people where able to harness vibranium and a teenager is the one and only brain behind most of modern Wakandan technology. I wasn't expecting anything in depth, just some basic story behind it.
3) The injection of political opinion. And the movie was actually pretty racist. I mean black tribes hooting like monkeys? How is that not racist. Regarding the injection of politics - it is just so unnecessary. And it wasn't even accurate either, like taking the stance that black slums exist due to evil white people and how fixing up buildings in these slums is going reduce the percentage of fatherless black families.
Anyway the movie was entertaining and that's mostly all I expect from the Marvel movies. Every now and then a Marvel movie offers a bit more but not this one."

","It's like the world is trying not to seem racist. Watching all movies up to date from the MCU i can witness that it has been difficult for the movies to gain an Academy award. Many have been nominated but none of them up until now have won any. Black Panther then suddenly took home 3 Academy awards and has grossed more money than any other MCU release. Also the metascore gave it an 88/100.<br/><br/>It has it's moments of clarity and emotion but Black Panther as a whole is very average (in my opinion) referencing todays generation of meme's such as ""What are those?!"" It's like it's attempting to woo the audience with modern social references, it just comes across as cringy.<br/><br/>This movie won an Oscar for best costume design, which i agree with as it's over view on african tribe traits was brilliant and the special effects were also on point (No Oscar for that though). Although it just didn't really have that spark.<br/><br/>Deffinetely worth a watch just don't get all hyped up. Good special effects, good production, good acting but an average story."

But its fundamental sin is the high ambition to impress its audience. And it does it. But not always inspired. It is an impressive film, no doubt. But, maybe writing the bad word, it is...too impressive. It is more an eccentric show than a reasonable film. Sure, it must be a blockbuster and I am happy for its succes to the young public. But, it could be better . Maybe because it has the right actors and the spider - story could be more reasonable. Off course, I am too subjective and too old for understand the noble intentions and the high virtues behind the each scene. But I feel it , with regret, as almost...racist film.

The graphics, in the way the tribes are shown, the waterfalls are all mesmerizing.
The poor part is the story and the direction. The entire story is somewhat boring and unconnected where you are not in charm to watch the next twist as it seems so predictable. Moreover, the exaggerated acting of Shuri kills while watching. The direction was below average as a brilliant story was presented in an average manner.

"jamesrupert2014","6","1","2","19 September 2018"," Disappointing, considering the hype
","I felt guilty disliking ""Black Panther' because, like ""Wonder Woman"" (2017), there was so much media focus on the supposed social significance of the film. The entire plot revolves around 'vibranium', a fictional unobtainium-like element in the MCU, out of which you can make anything that the plot requires or that would look cool on film. Wakanda, a hidden paradise in the heart of Africa, sits on a mountain of the miracle metal and therefore has technology, including weaponry, far beyond anything else on the planet (outside of Tony Stark's workshop and similar MCU hero/villain enclaves). The Black Panther is the super-powered king of Wakanda, whose costume can be stored in a necklace, allowing him to change instantly (where his civilian clothes go is not clear to me, but certainly the tightfitting cat suit can't be worn over his Savile Road suit) and, as The Black Panther, he can do pretty much anything (regardless of physics). Despite its sophisticated technology, the rulership of Wakenda is decided by brawling, so we end up with two Black Panthers: a good one and an evil one (maybe semi-evil, as he seems to be possessed by murderous good-intent if you are a fan of race-wars). Needless to say, this narrative bifurcation is resolved by a huge melee and a Black Panther mano a mano (easily the worst part of the film from a CGI perspective). Even by MCU standards, most of the characters are pretty much cut-out dolls (especially T'Challa's trite Q-like sister) with the exception of Micheal B. Gordons ""Kill Monger"", an implausible but at least interesting character. As these sorts of movies go, 'The Black Panther' is fine. The look is novel but the script and story are pretty typical of the genre, so perhaps ground breaking in the sociocultural world of big-budget comic book adaptations but otherwise, not much new. Maybe I just don't get it, but Wakanda is this incredibly wealthy enclave in Africa but these elite 1%ers don't seem willing to do anything to help out their troubled continent. I can accept ethical reasons for not using their hyper-advanced weaponry to solve Africa's problems but there seems little excuse not to surreptitiously assist with their hyper-advanced medical technology (I suspect that these are awkward questions best avoided in a movie based on a comic book in which they are the 'good guys')."

Despite the weak and often cliched writing / story, and even thin characters, the film still has a mostly fresh feel given the African setting, culture, etc. that helps make it memorable, along with its villain (and his ridiculous plan) who actually leaves a serious ideological impact (somewhat like Baron Zemo, though more successful).<br/><br/>7.75 / 10"
"amo_mdd","5","1","2","13 September 2018"," One of the few times I said sorry for choosing a movie
","I almost never write reviews. But this time I feel the need to say something.
My girlfriend and I will watch mostly any kind of movie. We have also watched all the Marvel movies up to this one. There were good ones, some were ok and a few really bad. But I never felt the need to say to my girlfriend ""I'm sorry I made you watch this"" until last night. She didn't think it was necessary, she knew that I had suffered through this at least as much as her. But let's pick this one apart just for a few words:<br/><br/>Scenario - plot: Ok.. I think I started with the lowest point. It was completely non-existent, nonsense and boring. Not much to write here, I think I already half-forgot what the movie was about but I distinctly remember the taste and feel of it (unfortunately).<br/><br/>Characters: If we're talking about cliched, flat 2-dimensional characters that are extremely predicable while at the same time being unrealistic, this should be a prime example. All Marvel movies flirt with this problem, but at least you care for the characters you're watching. In this one, I was going from total indifference to hate and back.<br/><br/>Effects - CGI: Aren't they supposed to get better by year? Was this shot 10 years ago? The underground scenes were horrible and the above-ground scenes were nauseating.<br/><br/>Acting: Here it's mixed. I can see the genuine efforts by many actors but I think the directing kinda mutes most of those peaks into rather bland outcomes. The protagonist especially has no emotion, no feel and no credibility in the way he portrays the main character. A different accent (one that comes and goes in many levels, often jarring) is not enough to make it real.<br/><br/>Continuity - world: I don't see many reviewers mention this one but viewers need a very high level of suspension of disbelief to enjoy this movie. I will talk vaguely to avoid any spoilers. The whole story behind ""technological advancement"" based on a specific element is bonkers from the start but they creators don't even make an effort to disguise it some. In reality, progression of science to higher levels requires so much collective effort, resources and communication that even advanced countries it appears to be a crawling process. Here, yeah right, you guessed it, the exact opposite. If you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about and you're already felt your brain flushed through the drain. And I'm not even mentioning all their habits, clothes, items used. Holy **** just thinking about it makes me furious; the whole idea is so stupid it shouldn't exist and it shouldn't have been made in to a movie from the start!<br/><br/>In conclusion, and after you've read and endured my rant, the real question is: Should you watch this movie? For those who have already done so and are just checking opinions, you know... what's done is done and you can't change it so if you didn't like the movie for any of the reasons mentioned above, congratulations, you have a good taste that matches mine (hehe) and we agree! For those thinking of watching this one? Well, let me tell you, it's a BAD movie, even compared to low Marvel standards and it will most likely make you frustrated and angry. It's also a redundant and needless movie, even for the Marvel Cinematic Universe... But, unfortunately, you WILL watch it, because like me you want your movies and stories in the proper order. And I don't blame you, because you should watch it actually! Bad movies should be watched now and then in order to make us understand what is bad and what is good, in order to appreciate the good and proper efforts even more. Yeah, so suffer it, just because of that! :D Cheers!"

"brianrorr","9","1","2","13 September 2018"," A great movie that calls all humans to rise above resentment
","An interesting movie, with a very different and thought-provoking balance between tribal African tradition/culture and modern technology and thinking. The movie does a great tribute to African culture that they have African dancing, songs, language, and honor for loving one's people. I loved the action, especially the great choreographed fighting by the Black Panther. King T'Challa is very mature, as very much seen in Captain America: Civil War, where he refuses to take revenge upon his father's murderer. It is there we are introduced to the mature hero that I feel Marvel needs. I seriously think Black Panther, along with Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor give a moral foundation for this Marvel storyline.<br/><br/>What I loved most however was that the movie called all of us humans, though mostly black people in my opinion, to let go of resentment from the past and elect to help others even if you may not gain from doing so. King T'Challa at the end of the movie addresses the United Nations, and boldly states that it is his and his country's goal to represent how all humans should treat others, by building relationships and forgiving one another, by thinking like one tribe. This is powerful stuff!! Tribalism plagues our world, in real life as well as the Marvel movies, dividing the Americans from the Middle East, the superheroes from each other, black people from the rest of the world as Erik Killmonger was preaching to the Wakandans when he killed T'Challa and became king.<br/><br/>Does encouraging black people to kill white people, to kill everyone who is ""lesser"" to them or who enslaved them solve the problems of resentment and tribalism in the world? No. It continues the cycle of hatred that we are all stuck in. I'm sorry if it is too bold to say, but all people including black people need to imagine themselves as one tribe, the human tribe, and let go of any resentments holding them back, as Black Panther rallies everyone to do at the end of this movie.<br/><br/>I loved that message and really give major props to this movie for boldly saying that we humans can and need to create one global family, one tribe, or we will all perish and kill each other.<br/><br/>Great movie, I recommend anyone to see it."

"ksgillihan","3","1","2","1 September 2018"," A classic example of reach exceeding grasp
","The hype surrounding this movie was incredible. I have never seen a movie so inflated before it even hit theaters. It was supposed to be some ground-breaking and awe-inspiring collection of actors in roles that were implied they were made for. A cast that perfectly fit the story line and would elevate this movie beyond mere Marvel offerings. What we got however, was a movie that wasn't even worthy of the source material.<br/><br/>I've been a huge fan of Marvel and have read the comics since I was a boy. I am fairly familiar with T'Challa and the Black Panther character. Captain America and he worked together on many missions protecting Wakanda and the United States against evildoers. T'Challa has a great backstory to his character. I was really hoping that this movie would showcase some of that so that we could appreciate the uniqueness in the Black Panther character. Sadly it did not. I wanted to see some of the hardships he faced as king. The warring between the tribes and how he manages to balance being a king and being the Black Panther. Instead we got a CGI heavy movie that lacked any sort of heart or fondness for it's own protagonist. The CGI wasn't good either. I expected more from a Marvel movie.<br/><br/>One of the reasons why a good hero is so important is that you have to have a good bad guy to go along with it. This movie did not. Killmonger's character was deluded down to an angry punk kid who just wanted to look cool and have power. The scenes with T'Challa and Killmonger would have been so much more meaningful had they taken advantage of the relationship they had together more. I felt no connection to the Killmonger character. They could have spent more time showing the conflict within T'Challa having to fight his own family just to stay alive. With the backstory of Killmonger, we should have felt a lot more sympathy towards him but the foundation just wasn't there. More time should have been spent on the conflict between the family and less time on CGI and bragging about the technology they had. Such a disappointment."

","Immediately I will say - the film is average. After watching it, you leave the cinema with mixed feelings. Somewhere worked with a bang and at some moments, obvious hackwork.<br/><br/>The visual part is amazing with its capabilities. The Marvel filmmakers again and again prove to us that they are professionals in their field. The picture is so colorful and colorful that for a while it allows not paying attention to the plot. But when the magic of CGI releases you a little and you begin to think about what is happening, you come to no comforting conclusions. The plot is trivial. It is simple and straightforward. And to be precise, the film consists of several stories and all of them are simple. They go one by one, where one ends - another begins. It's hard to explain, but when you watch it, the opinion arises that the writers seem to have forgotten to twist the story lines and laid it all out like lasagna, layers.<br/><br/>A little more annoying deliberate fairy tale of what is happening. They try to explain it with super advanced technologies, but as for me, Marvel has clearly overdone it with gadgets. Adamantium appears here almost as a ""manna from heaven"". He is strong, and technological, and heals wounds, and shoots with a sound from a spear. In a word, ""Fantasia"". About the main character's costume, in general, I keep quiet, an iron man nervously smokes around the corner. Not only is it bulletproof and can accumulate energy so much more ... and is placed in a matchbox. Nothing less than what happens except magic. But the main claims are not to the plot and not to the fairy-tale.<br/><br/>The main claims to the main antagonist. There are two of them. And if the first one is an image of a standard villain, with material motivation and could serve as an unpretentious but suitable anti-hero, then about the second one, it's not so simple. In his address was addressed a whole bunch of positive reviews from critics and ordinary viewers, they say, see what is not a standard antagonist, with his ""not on the level"" formed vision of the world and completely logical argumentation of their actions. He tries to appear before us a multifaceted personality. And he, it seems, can, but .... This does not work. Looking at him, you subconsciously understand that a person who has passed through a bunch of military conflicts can not so reflect, can not act like that. We slip a 14 year old teen in the body of a pumped up guy. He behaves like an offender and a hysterical person, and at the end he becomes, trite, pathetic.<br/><br/>I am not film critic but for me critical point for this film 2 out of 10, but generally 5 out of 10."

Black Panther is not one of the good movies. It's not a good superhero movie and definitely not a good movie overall. It lacks originality as well as a good quality plot, acting is fine but nothing special, no good characters except maybe the villain, but he is nothing special.

It just was better than the average Marvel villain, which is the lowest bar possible. He had a point, so by making it a psycho (kills anybody that gets in the way and cant form any kind of relationship because he's broken and all he has is hate blablal) makes it easier to relativize his ideas, right or wrong. This way, if you want to say ""he's right"", you can say the movie supports that. If you want to say, ""of course he was wrong"", you can say the movie supports that take. It's cheap. If you don't want to say anything about politics, why even pretend? Just don't touch politics.<br/><br/>The hero could've been great.

"littleging12","5","1","2","9 August 2018"," Most Overrated Movie of 2018
","Marvel's ""Black Panther"" treads new grounds as it takes on racial and political problems, as well as being a blockbuster action film. ""Black Panther"" works as a positive medium for building bridges; it has a good message, but is not a good movie. Once you look past the political and social ambitions the film aims for, it's just another by-the-numbers predictably average comic book movie. <br/><br/>The only real impressive thing about the movie is its villain. Michael B. Jordan was forced to carry the movie, and when he wasn't on screen it was painfully boring (most of the first hour). His villainous Erik Killmonger stands as one of the better MCU villains. His ferocious yet sympathetic portrayal of a vengeful man gave the movie the spark it needed to avoid sucking. Also his super fit body jacked the eye candy way up (for a second I thought I was gay). However, Killmonger suffers from abrupt Dr. Evil syndrome. His prime motivation is to give all black people around the world specialized weapons made from vibranium, a mined substance in the technologically advanced Wakanda, to seize social dominance over any non-black person. I'm surprised he did not ask for laser beams attached to the heads of sharks. I'm sure the vibranium is capable of such matters. <br/><br/>Without the emergence of Michael B. Jordan's more interesting villain, ""Black Panther"" is a dreadfully formulaic, predictable and borderline boring superhero movie. The characters, outside Killmonger, are pretty forgettable and uninteresting. The comic relief is very inconsistent; a few jokes hit while most completely miss the mark. The CGI is noticeably sub-par. The action sequences are not poorly done but don't leave a lasting impression. Many of the film's plot points you can see coming from a mile away (T'Challa vs. Killmonger part I and II, M'Baku's entrance, T'Challa's return). <br/><br/>""Black Panther"" is a movie that is getting such spectacular reviews from critics because it has a socially proactive message, touches upon real world issues, and nearly has an unprecedented all black cast in a superhero movie. Judging it as a piece of entertainment, it is wickedly underwhelming, predictable and disappointing."

Unlike all the other MCU movies this one feels more like an adventure movie than just a plain old superhero film like I said the lighting, colour, score and costumes are just amazing. <br/><br/>The usual thing to do in comic book movies is to just totally ignore the character development of the villain and just concentrate on the hero, well Black Panther doesn't go that route, opting to concentrate on the hero and the villain equally. Achieving something truly rare in Hollywood movies a perfectly complete character arc for a villain. <br/><br/>I saw this movie 3 times at the theater and about 20 times now on BluRay.

","This is going to be difficult, did I enjoy the film - yes. Did I think it was as good as the critics say - no. Do I think it's worthy of all the awards and plaudits it's received - no. Do I think it's been talked up due to the ethnic diversity contained in the film - yes (sorry). <br/><br/>Black Panther introduces the Marvel universe to Wakanda, the fictional home of the Wankandan people and their king/leader/superhero saviour -the Black Panther. In a nutshell the movie is this - a new king arrives home, he doubts himself, the crown is threatened, a new king emerges and dethrones the old king, the new king turns out to be bad, conflict ensues to the point of civil war, fights occur everywhere, the old king realises his worth, by the end of the film everything is ok again. Chadwick Boseman plays a decent role as T'Challa, but Michael B Jordan plays a better villain in Killmonger for me. The coolest things about the film were the weapons and tech, the best character was Shuri (Letitia Wright) because she delivered humour as well as action. <br/><br/>The plot was weak and it's been done before - I have an issue when superhero's fight practically identical carbon copy superhero's - the worst part of ""Antman"" for example was Antman fighting Yellow-jacket as they were practically the same. The worst part of the Iron Man films was when he fought against carbon copies of the Iron Man he'd made. I even hated computer games that did that - Ken/Ryu in Street Fighter - SubZero/Scorpion in Mortal Kombat - It's lazy and it's cheap! Black Panther sadly does exactly that. Throw together two black panther suits, identifiable mainly by the varying shades used on the trim - and then the action scene's just look like lazy CGI dancing, something you'd expect to see a college computer design student make.<br/><br/>I think this movie got the acclaim it did because 99% of the cast were black - for me I don't care what colour, race or religion somebody is - film is about the story, it's about losing yourself to something fun and exciting. There are some seriously great films out there with a black cast, but they didn't get the praise they deserved - I'm sure there will be excellent films in the future with black superhero's saving the day too. Unfortunately this film felt like it had already been done before a hundred times over. For me, it didn't live up to the expectation of hype I'd read into. I really wanted a lot more from Black Panther - I just hope that the next installment has a better and more original story line. I'd love to rate this higher but the best I can give it is 6 out of 10 because it didn't feel original or fresh."

You could say that from a movie that got only a dozen reviews but not in this case with more than 2000 reviews. I've seen dozens of movies where the ratings were rigged but Black Panther is not one of them. That you don't like this movie is your right, but don't talk about fake reviews, because in this case you're the one with a fake review, giving the lowest score possible is just a joke. You're not going to tell me that this movie was one of the worst movies you ever saw, or I can only conclude you never watched alot of movies before. I'm not a big fan of Marvel movies, most of the time I'm a bit bored, but with Black Panther I didn't have that feeling. The story was interesting, maybe not perfect but at least it wasn't boring. The acting was okay even if it was not world class acting. The computer generated images were in most of the cases good, sometimes they could have been better, certainly with a high budget like that, but nonetheless it was all entertaining. And entertainment is exactly what I expect to get when watching this kind of movies.

","As an Avengers comics fan, I always had some interest for the Black Panther, which was a mix of interesting elements: Enhanced physicality, hi-tech and royal matters - royal matters in Africa! The film plays well on these elements. <br/><br/>I like the fact that Wakadans were divided, and not divided along a clear good/evil line, but divided along actual polemic elements like interventionism vs isolationism. All was not so clear cut which I think is a good point. If I were black, I would wonder about the ""hope from the above tribe"" message here, given that no such ""above tribe"" exists. Maybe it deals in ideals rather than hope - for they are much different. <br/><br/>The cinematography was well, but there was a problem with the tempo, a problem that makes it that its rythm is regular. Actors were okay, with the one playing the ""General"" being excellent in terms of acting and appearance. Images of modern Wakanda were amazing and different if a bit PC in their representation. The look of the ""Gorilla"" tribe's settings was awesome.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the most interesting vilain is lost somewhere in the middle of the movie. The fight scenes, especially the one between the two Panthers, are lacking in imagination and drama. The costumes, especially the one the Panther wears, looks a bit over-done.<br/><br/>All in all this is a movie that's with Iron Man 2 and Thor dark World rather than with Civil War or Ragnarok - a bit of a harduous movie, that will hopefully set the terrain for a better second chapter.

","I don't watch much marvel movies or any super heroes movies, I used to liked them when they first started to become populars like the first X-men or the first Avenger. They were entertaining, funny and originals to a certain degree, they didn't reinvent the wheel of actions movies, but they pushed it to the limits. After a while though they became quite repetitive sometimes more than other, but with a movie every 6 months or so it's hard to follow without loosing interest. So this is where I stand, I enjoy action, I enjoy special effects, I enjoy Super heroes, but more than anything I like to be entertain.<br/><br/>It's basically 2 stories, first it's a heist movie disguised as a spy movie disguised as a superhero movie, after that it's the classic Disney prince story of king loose his kingdom, has to fight for it, meet resistance.<br/><br/>Sadly this movie wasn't quite entertaining sure it had pretty much all the check points of a big action movie... in fact any type of action movies: hand combat, sword fights, gun fights, army fights and space ships fights, car chase, spy gadgets, super heroes gadgets, casino meet up with the bad guys, illegal merchandise contraband, cia, spies, super soldiers, girl army, rhinoceros, etc. 
Problem was the delivery was off on most of them, there was a LOT of things going on, they tried to do everything, while also introducing a team of 4+1 people + their aunts and uncles, 2 bad guys, 2 other tribes chiefs. It makes at least 9 characters to introduce and create a personality for them with screen time and dialogues, it doesn't work and we end up with pretty unidimensional characters with no depth. There was nothing original outside of it being in a fictional Africa, costumes where amazing by the way (I'm not talking about black panther per say). <br/><br/>Looking at some critics though I feel like it did absolutely what it needed to do, it realized the phantasms of most of the black audience. It was kind of a celebration of what any kid with some feeling of the weight of blacks oppressions over the years would like to happen to the black community. I think it really touch a sensible nerve with the black American community in that sense. For me it felt like just giving everything he wanted to the viewer. While being empowering in a sense it didn't gave much satisfaction cinematographically speaking.<br/><br/>It didn't bring anything new on the table, no character offered much possibly to get attached to except maybe the bad guy. In the end it felt really flat and soulless everything looked quite clinical (that's what happen when you shoot everything in front of green screens) and most character had the depth of a page of paper. Unless you're a big super hero movie, stay away from this movie, it's a forgettable effort."
"shadow_blade-89459","9","1","2","7 June 2018"," Welcomed Addition
","""Black Panther"" (2018) is an action science fiction about an African prince named T'Challa, played by Chadwick Boseman, as he takes the throne of Wakanda and the role of Black Panther after his father is murdered on U.S. soil. His throne becomes threatened after a mistake made by his father comes back to haunt the kingdom and challenge the throne. I can honestly say, ""I love this film."" Even though I have never been to Africa, it gave me a sense of pride. I did find it odd that a society so advanced would resort back to primitive battle to challenge the throne. The visuals were magnificent with only a handful of the stunt effects appearing cartoonish. Even though the film is about T'Challa and Wakanda, I am enjoyed the different layers within the story. It helped to provide sufficient backstory to certain characters without detracting from the main storyline. Ryan Cooglar did an outstanding job bringing this comic book story to life.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was phenomenal. I believe everyone's own flavor added to their character, especially Erik Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan of ""Creed."" I thought I would be annoyed at the portrayal of African dialect, but I was pleasantly surprised. Overall, this film is amazing. The actors pull you into the story through their superb performances and embracing of the character. The landscape visuals are magical, and the action scenes provide adrenaline even though there are a few flaws. The story instills a sense of pride through its science fiction that I have never experienced before. I highly recommend this film for its comic ties and gripping storyline."
"jurassicsean","Null","1","2","6 June 2018"," A pretty good Marvel movie
","I can't say this movie's perfect, because it's not. However, it's better than most. So let's talk a little bit about the pros and cons. <br/><br/>Let's stay positive for a minute. The costumes, designs, music, and acting is all really good. I especially like Michael B. Jordan's performance. It was a different beat to everyone else in the film. This movie is also a lot more colorful than most Marvel movies, which are typically kinda drab. This one pops with colors, much like Thor: Ragnarok and the Guardians movies, so that's great. Now let's get to the part you've been waiting for: the villain. Killmonger is probably my favorite MCU villain so far (I haven't seen Infinity War yet, so I can't say anything about Thanos). The main reason I like him is not so much the motivation, but the impact he has on Black Panther. Killmonger's vision makes T'Challa change his mindset, which no other MCU villain has ever done. <br/><br/>The things I didn't like. The CGI was not always good. In some scenes, it looked like PS2 graphics, which is embarassing. This is my only big complaint with the movie. <br/><br/>Overall, this is not the best MCU movie, but it's definiteky not the worst. It's probably in my top five."
"losermcgee","8","1","2","6 June 2018"," Phenomenal superhero film is groundbreaking with diverse cast and excellent themes
","I'm going to start this review off by saying this is one of the best superhero films I have seen in my life. The themes and characters are beyond what we have seen in a recent superhero film. One of the films strongest points is its visuals which are more creative and unique than any Marvel film to date. The clear ingenuity of the crew working on this movie is present in every visually stunning scene, which is practically every scene. This is by far the most beautifully shot Marvel movie to date. Wakanda itself is a visual masterpiece and it only gets better from there. If had to complain about one thing, it would have to be the action scenes, which are good, just a bit average, which makes it seem a lot worse, when everything in this movie is incredible otherwise. Perhaps the best part of Black Panther: the characters. The best part about the characters is their diversity dn excellent representation of a black cast and female leads. T'Challa himself is a sort of bland character. He more or less feels like the typical kind of average lead in a superhero movie, despite excellent acting from Boseman. Similar to T'Challa, Everett Ross is one of the few things keeping this movie from a 10 star rating. He is just a typical white guy stuck in a foreign nation with no clue what to do. Once again, martin Freeman has a great performance, but the problem lies in the character and the fact he really doesn't improve the movie at all. It ends up being Killmonger who steals the show the most, presenting an excellent villain, with a great backstory and very strong acting. He is everything you need in a villain. He is badass, as the scene after the museum heist proves. He is an excellent foe to challenge the protagonist and his goals are understandable. That may not sound like a necessity for a good villain, but trust me, it is. The fact that you are able to see where the villain is coming from helps you understand his character and the fact that he is doing this for the mistake of a previous Black Panther. Klawe is also a great villain, mostly because of Andy Serkis' stellar performance. He doesn't really do much, but he has some great humor and that acting is so perfect. Also, I have never seen a movie handle its female characters as well as this film. Gone are damsels in distress or females who are there to be love interests and nothing else. All of the females in this movie are badass, unique characters. I would especially like to highlight Shuri, who is a character that proves a very young, black, female can be incredibly smart and still be amazing at combat. Shuri is an excellent character, a character most films in general have failed to create as compelling a character. Okoye proves hardass bodyguards don't have to be buff men in tuxes, and Nakia proves that females can actually be the ones to save the day and be the one who has the correct plan for the nation, rather than a simple love interest. In conclusion, this film has some of most well-characterized, original, likable and compelling characters in a movie ever. Another excellent character, this one something of a surprise is M'Baku. M'Baku ends up being a fun, badass, excellent character who doesn't have a huge role but Winston Duke uses his screen time to create an extremely compelling character. Something to go with that same concept is the story of family. T'CHalla might be boring character but he is part of a brilliant family blood relatives or not, that will stop at nothing to save him. It is possibly the best part of the film, when the story focuses on that group of people who has not yet given up on T'Challa. Yet another amazing thing about this film is the politics involved with it. The theme, message, and resolution of the story of Wakanda, and yes the nation does have a story, is a very good, wonderfully thought story. This film captures racial politics unlike any film I have recently seen. In an industry that finally supports fins revolving around a mainly black cast and the story of how black people fit into the world around them, I am glad to see this film made. The themes of Wakanda standing alone and the themes involving the other countries of the world are all amazing themes that will leave you thinking about this film's real-life significance even after it is over. Not since Get Out has a movie done that to me. Lastly, the story in this film is incredibly compelling. All the scenes will have the audience drawn in. You will be at the edge of your seat, caring for all the main characters, hoping that Killmonger is defeated. This is one of the few recent movies that captured my interest all the way through, and not only did it do that, it also used an excellent diverse cast to play amazing character, wonderfully shot scenes and amazing themes."
"undeaddt","7","1","2","6 June 2018"," I liked it, but I admit it is a bit overrated.
","Overall, I pretty much liked this movie, altho I admit it is surely overrated. I believe that the reason why it is overrated is because of the fame and glory MCU gets nowadays, but still it is a movie that deserves respect, most of all because of all the different aspects the movie offers. The special effects are all over the movie and they are amazing, altho at some moments they were even to much for my taste. But I honestly expected a bit more from the story, since I had not read anything about the Black Panther from the Marvel comics before. At times, the movie took to long to progress, which made it boring at few points , as the movie is 2h and 15 min. long. I certainly enjoyed ""Bilbo"" and Daniel Kaluuya being in this movie which made my day, since I did not see the cast before I started watching the movie and I was positively surprised. 7/10"

","Considering the magnificence of Coogler's Fruitvale Station -- a deeply moving piece of art -- it's hard to understand how this movie could exert so little effort in even the most rudimentary building up of characters and stakes that matter to those characters and to the audience. I could not figure out who I was supposed to root for or why. And then there's the credibility of this country that is sort of known about in the outside world and sort of not known about, and glowing blue airships taking off over American cities with only a couple of kids in a basketball court noticing. And how exactly does the Vibranium economy work and enable the building of those magnificent skyscrapers? (Two stars instead of one is because of the gorgeous exhilarating shot of the ship landing in the city for the first time.) And why on a movie of this budget couldn't somebody hire a really good dialect coach to get the accents uniform and convincing? Given the billion dollars and the worldwide acclaim I must be wrong. Or maybe I was out of the room when they did the hypnotizing."
"cocofrance","6","1","2","3 June 2018"," Interesting female characters; Men...not so much
","Entertaining but only b/c of the female characters. The male characters (with two exceptions) had zero personality or depth. T'Challa's sister, girlfriend and general were the only reasons this movie held my interest. Give them their own movie already! <br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman is a great actor but he's given so little to do in this other than act tough. Such a one-dimensional character. And Daniel Kaluuya's switch from good guy to bad guy back to good guy came with no apparent reason or explanation. And wait...did he have a relationship with the General? Don't know. And Forest Whitaker was DOA the whole movie. Wait...wasn't Sterling K. Brown in this? Can't remember. Come to think of it Angela Bassett was also given very little to work with. Snore. Martin Freeman's character had more charisma than all the above-mentioned characters put together. <br/><br/>Such a waster of talent!<br/><br/>At least Michael B. Jordan and Winston Duke's characters were given some personality that let them stretch their acting skills a wee bit. <br/><br/>CGI was also pretty lame and plot holes were pretty wide. <br/><br/>And what's Black Panther's super power anyway? He puts on a suit (created by his sister) and leaps around punching and scratching? The armored rhinos were more interesting and deadly. <br/><br/>The best character in the movie was Wakanda itself. Make a movie about a high-tech country in the middle of Africa with a girl genius, a kick-ass female general and an endearing CIA agent. Leave out the super cat and all his stoic compatriots. I'd watch."

"siylencedogood","6","1","2","21 May 2018"," Entertaining but the hype was way overblown.
","I liked the Black Panther Character in Civil War, and the fact that he was a conscientious character made him even more respectable. The movie didn't add much. His sister was far more interesting, and far more capable in terms of technology and innovation. Killmonger was merely a racist murderer who needed to be put down regardless what kind of childhood he had. What we go through doesn't remove our personal responsibility, which the writers seemed to be pushing, that because he suffered tragedy and had a hard childhood, he was somehow to be excused for his criminality. Criminals choose how to act and how to react to their circumstances, and no amount of victim-hood propaganda is going to change that.<br/><br/>When it came down to believe-ability and urgency it just didn't hold water. Killmonger's taking the Wakanda tech to conquer the world for the black supremacists would have been dealt with by the same people Black Panther fought with in Civil War. Just send in the Hulk and Thor. Dr. Strange would have Killmonger locked away in some endless loop for eternity.<br/><br/>Overall, as my subject states...it's entertaining, but not the best Marvel superhero movie ever. Thor Ragnarok was funnier, had more action, more urgency and far more believe-ability."

The music score was a redeeming factor, but couldn't carry uninspired CGI combat in the later half of the movie.<br/><br/>My advice to anyone who wants to watch this movie is to wait till Andy Serkis dies, then turn the screen off."

It wasn't very entertaining I feel like this film was an over hyped movie and it got my hopes up, but for people who love super hero movies they will love it no matter what. A lot of the fighting scenes were a little too slow and the plot wasn't very well written. But it does teach us that even our family members can be bad and you should still love them no matter what and you should share what you have to people in need. The character Michael B.

"shanethedane","7","1","2","18 May 2018"," A Decent Movie, but What's All the Buzz About?
","Now I understand that a big reason for this movie's popularity is the fact that it is made up of primarily black people. Now don't get me wrong, I think this is great; in fact I would say it needed to happen. This is something we've never seen in a superhero movie and it was quite refreshing. Erik Killmonger is an excellent antagonist; in my opinion, the best in the MCU (at least until Thanos came around). He was a great opponent to T'Challa physically and emotional due to their very apparent clashing ideologies. The reason I say that is because his motive and his cause is something that is very relate-able to the US today. Many people still feel a sense of racial prejudice and he resembled that pretty well. The only problem is that he was really only in the second half of the movie. The first half was about Andy Serkis character and his whole crusade for vibranium. I think he did pretty well, but he and the Black Panther had no qualities that really resonated well together; I just wasn't interesting in the story for the first half. Then once Killmonger comes back it's a totally different movie with a new plot. Why? Because Ryan Coogler wanted to tell Killmonger's story and he simply had Andy Serkis in the film to keep up continuity after Age of Ultron... Black Panther as a character was very boring and un-compelling to me. The CGI was mediocre at best; there were multiple times where I was taken right out of a scene because I was focusing on the background that was very clearly fake. I also thought the cinematography was questionable, especially during the fight scenes. I am tired of shaky tight shots during big action scenes, which this film has a lot of. Check this movie out of you want to, but I'd say you'll live by passing it up."

If Andy Serkis' character didn't die in the middle of the film, it would be more fun, as his character was the only thing interesting. One star for Andy Serkis. Martin Freeman is acting himself again. Chadwick Boseman feels like ""I'll just say these lines and go home"".

This movie belittles real conflict and makes wars and conflict seem so trivial (most Marvel movies do). They make it seem like people just fight over nothing. 
Another thing that didn't make sense was the villain waited to challenge the young king, when he could've challenged the old king and had a higher chance of success. Apparently by the movie rules he can challenge whenever he wants.

","I watched the Black Panther last night at my grandparents house excited to see my first Marvel Movie since Guardians Volume 2. It first began with me having high hopes for this movie, and I left feeling that this is definitely why I love Marvel. This is also my first time on the review page, so I was expecting a lot of great reviews about Black Panther. That was not the case. Many of these reviews called it ""another standard marvel movie"" or ""cliche"". Some of them even complained about the huge Black cast. For one thing, it is a backstory movie for the black panther before infinity war, as the only other time he showed up on the big screen was during Captain America: Civil War. We needed more about him so we have an understanding of his past. Well, now that that's over, let me get on with my review.<br/><br/>Thank god that this movie knows how to make an easy to follow yet interesting story. The premise is basically that he becomes the new king of the technically advanced African nation, Wakanda, and must fight a terrorist organization that stole Vibranium from the nation, while figuring out his father's past. May I say it is pretty simple, but how it's portrayed is what makes it more entertaining. The acting was great, and also showed that strong, female roles can be done without making them the lead. Chadwick Boseman does great as T'Challa. The special effects and the portrayal of the Wakandan Capital are great. especially with the mountains shown in the background. My only problem was with the fight scene between Erik Killmonger and T'Challa for the battle of king, and Erik supposedly kills Black Panther. You knew that he had to live, because it would ruin the movie. It's very predictable in the end. Besides this, what faults does the movie have. I thought that every part of it was done well, and it deserves to be one of the better Marvel movies."

Personally, I can relate to the criticism, some of the complaints were true but their severity is greatly exaggerated. Yes it was a little dry at times, yes the characters could have been better defined but these are hardly fatal flaws. I heard someone say it was far fetched....if we're gonna go that route stay away from Marvel all together these are stores about characters with unbelievable abilities that's what they've always been. So anyone who believes it far fetched I ask do you believe in super soldier serum? You really think people get pissed and turn green?? You think Dr Strange really travels the multiverse with magic??? Cmon guys, far fetched is unfair. Also for those who think it far fetched and criticize the believability keep in mind ALL of these story plots had been formulated LONG before these movies. The characters and abilities and origin stories are all taken DIRECTLY from the Marvel books of the past, it's not like someone made this story up last week. Every character and origin story is only telling you what the book said, the specific mission or adventure is fabricated but all characters abilities and origins come from Stan Lee so I don't wanna hear that this story was fantastical nonsense unlike other marvel movies. It's a good movie, not perfect, but I had to stick up for the movie after reading all these terrible reviews. Movie goers will enjoy this movie don't listen to the complaints"

","The Black Panther is a fun romp, but it definitely has some issues. First, the good.<br/><br/>The action is fun, the emotions hit home, and the story isn't dirt-poor. <br/><br/>While the CGI gets ripped on from time to time, I thought it was solid enough for a Marvel movie. The fight scenes were relatively well-choreographed, as well. The ritual combat scenes were exciting and visually appealing. The fights in Korea were also fun to see, and while I'm not a fan of car chase scenes as a whole, I did enjoy this one. It was reminiscent of a James Bond movie. <br/><br/>In fact, that's another appeal, at least to me. The secret technology base and the fun action scenes were a great callback to James Bond-type movies. I do think the movie would have been complemented by giving T'Challa a similar vice as Bond's, although Marvel probably wouldn't veer down that line for the seemingly morally absolute King of Wakanda.<br/><br/>The story, well, it's a mixed bag. Everything seemed crammed together with major emotional keys being rushed through or somewhat ignored. The concept is fine though. A long lost relative comes to challenge the new king, wins, and shows his colors, becoming something amoral. The king comes back and takes down the usurper, realizing something about themselves/their kingdom in the process. It's tired, but not so tired it damages the movie. <br/><br/>This is where the issues begin to rise, though. The movie is really a movie and a half or two movies crammed into one. Wakanda has a ton of wonderful mythology, but almost none of it is explained. The movie never really explains how the Wakandans used vibranium was used to make themselves wealthy. It touches on it in some exposition, but there was much more that was just glossed over. <br/><br/>In addition, W'Kabi became radicalized by Killmonger much too quickly for such a pivotal relationship to flip. Some of the emotional aspects of the movie fell flat because they weren't given enough screen time. <br/><br/>Despite its flaws, Black Panther is a fun movie that adds to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It should have been two movies, but I doubt this is the last we'll see of Wakanda.<br/><br/>The movie does ask some thought provoking questions, but they're really not pursued. The one consequence shown in the movie isn't so much related to the questions the movie asks, but it is the result of a singular poor decision unrelated to the social and economic questions the movie asks."

I think they overdid the ""challenge for the crown"", but the rest of the film was solid, and Wakanda is beautiful.<br/><br/>I can definitely recommend this movie and am happy I saw it, though it might not be for you if you're white and squeamish about race or getting pulled out of your comfort zone."

If you believe to have found an important message for mankind, or parts of it, you're reading something into it which simply is not there. For sure the makers of this movie were the ones most surprised of what viewers believed to have found in this film. Even worse, if you really wanted to find a message, then it carries a message of anti-democracy. I should have known better since whenever the American mainstream believes to have found something of cultural significance, it's most likely BS. Hollow through and through, but entertaining enough to watch it to the end, hence 5 stars. Unfortunately it left me disappointed, but this only because of the undeserved high expectations."

","I generally like Marvel movies. They've had a low point recently, with Civil War, which I didn't like, but with Homecoming and Thor: Ragnarok, I really felt like they started to improve and balance their humour and good story well.
Based on the trailer for Black Panther, I did not like the movie from the start. The trailer was awful. Then the ratings came out, and I thought that maybe I was wrong. People called it the next Avatar. But I had a bad feeling walking into the theatre after I realized that all the reviews were talking about were the ""diversity"" of the movie.
And- it turns out I was right. This movie is awful. The story is cliched and forgettable, the characters are standard except that John Watson guy, and it's awfully paced and boring. Nothing stands out. It's been a few months now and nobody is talking about this movie anymore... well, maybe about the black diversity thing, but not the actual movie quality itself. Hmmm. I wonder why. Probably because this movie is **%#%%, and all the critics are scared that they'll be called racist if they don't like it.
I mean, an 88, really? That's just ridiculous. I've always trusted metacritic, but this must be a joke. I want to see all these critics watch this movie again in thirty years and see how much they like it.
Yeah- this is what happens when you involve social politics in movies. Movies are an art, not a platform. And this movie is like a kindergardener's drawing."

However, I found it to be about as formula-driven and predictable as I have come to expect from Marvel movies. In short, it is just more of the same, wrapped up in a nice veneer of ""Oh look!

But it is not the be-all and end-all of movie craft that some would have you believe.<br/><br/>The acting is fair and there is the ever-present Marvel sense of humour throughout.

It may be Marvel fatigue setting in, but you'd think they'd at least try to do something different with the story.

"asifahsankhan","6","1","2","29 April 2018"," Black Panther does a little more than an average MCU film
","With his regal demeanour, noble disposition, and unquestionable ability to kick an ass or 20, Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa proved himself worthy of the Black Panther suit in Captain America: Civil War. Had his solo film expanded on these three qualities, while delivering the necessary fights and funnies that define the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it would have made for a good film. Ryan Coogler's Black Panther does much more.<br/><br/>Like most of the films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the plot runs by a tried-and-true blueprint. This time, it follows the footsteps of the first Thor with story beats surrounding royalties, loyalties, betrayals, outcasts and family secrets that feel familiar (sometimes predictable). However, they play naturally to the majestic and technologically advanced world of Wakanda.<br/><br/>If anyone deserves to retire as kings and queens, it's the art department. There's so much creativity displayed in the makeup, costuming, sets, and sci-fi designs that a single watch cannot absorb it all. From the striking attire of the Dora Milaje warriors to the sand-like magnetic thingy-ma-bobs that power Wakandan tech, every detail adds wonderment to a world that imagines an African culture gifted with near-unlimited resources and untainted by colonialism.<br/><br/>The poisons of history play a big part in Black Panther - not just with colonialism, but with any past act that later proves to be problematic. This is what powers Michael B Jordan's Killmonger, a vicious yet sympathetic adversary with enough depth to make him one of the more memorable villains in the MCU.<br/><br/>However, the true knockout stars are Lupita Nyong'o as Wakandan spy Nakia and Danai Gurira as Dora Milaje general Okoye. They're given multiple times to shine using both their heroic fists and their stand-up comedy routines while sticking to their own rounded subplots.<br/><br/>Weirdly enough, Get Out's Oscar-nominated star Daniel Kaluuya ends up falling a little flat as commander W'Kabi, using a casual 'did you just fart?' face for almost every confrontation. His relationship with Okoye also seems non-existent until the film coughs it up during an otherwise exciting climax. But those are minor complaints for a film that feels gargantuan in almost every other way."
"vinniec-53536","6","1","2","29 April 2018"," Good, But Not Great
","'Black Panther' is being praised as ""Marvel's masterpiece"", but unfortunately it didn't quite live up to the hype for me. The film's first act is enjoyable, where we are told the origin of the African nation of Wakanda and introduced to the main characters. Sadly though, the second act felt drawn-out and kind of boring, and the film never seems to regain it's momentum after that. The scenery is beautiful and it is very well-shot. Wakanda is easily one of the coolest and most vibrant locations in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and I can't wait to see more of it in May's 'Avengers: Infinity War' (YAY!!!). Some of the acting was terrific, particularly Black Panther's sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), the film's primary villain Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens (Michael B. Jordan), and secondary villain Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis). Shuri and Klaue served as the film's comic relief, and their humor was refreshing and on-point. Killmonger is definitely one of Marvel's best villains to date. He was intimidating and captivating to watch. Unfortunately, Black Panther himself (Chadwick Boseman) didn't seem to show much emotion and struck me as very monotonous. The action scenes were pretty cool, but some of them were too dark and I didn't always know who was who, which made them hard to follow. The end fight between Black Panther and Killmonger felt very CGI-heavy, which took away from the enjoyment. Although I like the design of Black Panther's new suit more than his first suit from 'Captain America: Civil War', it looked too cartoony for my taste. It was even more unfortunate that Killmonger had the exact same type of suit with a different design. Overall, 'Black Panther' was good, but fell short of great."

Me , as an initial viewer of Marvel movies, did not like the IM2 movie as it lacked the action and a good story. Though, people argue that story of both movies (IM2, BP) were great and some even went on great lengths to praise it (BP) as best for some race.
But, for me this is all gimmick whatever fashion and issues are trending gets used by big companies to paddle money and common people get conned.

"MichaelMRamey","8","1","2","15 April 2018"," Rising Above The Hype
","I went into this film fully expecting to be underwhelmed; only because it had been hyped so much. Black Panther did something only the likes of Deadpool did - it impressed despite being built up as a phenomenal film. For those of you who aren't as deep into the Marvel Cinematic Universe as you'd like, let me first discuss what the film is about and who the titular character is.<br/><br/> The first time we saw Black Panther was in Captain America: Civil War and like 50% of the characters, I didn't know a lot about him, but he stole every scene he was in, in that film. This film is his origin story, giving us a glimpse at the man (T'Challa) behind the mask and making us care and connect with the hero - something DC has been failing to do. Black Panther draws from the similar Lion King storyline, which in turn draws from the story of Hamlet; a king who is overthrown by a villainous counterpart, only to fight his way back to his rightful throne. That being said; it clearly isn't a shot for shot remake and blazes its own trail for the future Avenger.<br/><br/> Black Panther is highly entertaining, straddling the line between action and character-driven storytelling brilliantly. Chadwick Boseman - who get this, is 41-years-old - feels as though he was born to play the leading role; becoming one of the most natural on-screen heroes since Chris Evans' Captain America. Andy Serkis reminded me of how good of an actor he is, even without CGI. The women - specifically Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o's characters - held their own playing heavy roles throughout the film. In a film featuring two strong male leads, they're able to display even larger feats of strength and power - Nakia is no Lois Lane. This film was the most well-cast film I've ever seen. I continuously said ""Oh I didn't know they were in this"" throughout the film after quickly being sucked in by their character. I can't say anything bad about any of the characters' including the token white character Ross played by Martin Freeman who has quickly become the new Agent Coulson - connecting all of the MCU films together and having a much larger role in this film. However, the person that stole the show was Michael B. Jordan.<br/><br/> Jordan's Killmonger was outstanding, giving us the villain we didn't know we wanted and redeeming himself from his role in The Fantastic Four. Jordan is one of Hollywood's most underrated actors - have you seen Creed? You find yourself sympathizing with Killmonger throughout the film because he isn't your general good vs. evil villain. The reasoning behind his actions are understandable, delivering some of the most memorable lines from ""Can you believe that? A kid from Oakland walking around and believing in fairytales,"" to ""Bury me in the ocean with my ancestors what jumped from the ships because they knew death was better than bondage."" A powerful character for such a powerful film, especially in today's racial climate.<br/><br/> The bottom line for Black Panther is it's an entertaining film that features culture and something new for a Superhero film. I don't have an official list on hand, but I know Black Panther would be in the top five films for me in the MCU - possibly top three. Don't miss out on this soon to be classic."
"jakobwerling","10","1","2","14 April 2018"," ""Black Panther is Marvel's Greatest and Will Transcend Generations!
","Black Panther is definitely not the biggest hero in the Marvel Universe. Well, in the comics he isn't. He also isn't the most popular, or the oldest, or the most powerful. But, he comes close to all of those and one thing he can claim is that he probably has the best movie adaptation out of all of the other super heroes in the Marvel Universe. The first thing I should mention about this amazing movie though is it's message! The movie introduces very complex themes and ideas, such as ""why would a country that could save the world hide from it"" and ""how can a man kill his own brother yet still lead a nation with expertise."" There's also almost constant social commentary and complex debates on various issues. So it is nice to see a movie that both makes us think and makes us ooh and ahh for once, especially one coming from Disney. The story is also great. It is also full of complex ideas and full of twists, though it also comes with a couple of kinks, but it is still pretty good. The acting is also great, Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan especially shining as the protagonist T'Challa/Black Panther and the antagonist Erik Killmonger. They are both amazing! The supporting cast is also great as well. Lupita Nyongo'o brings a nice hard ass vibe to her character of Nakia, the world desperately needs more characters like her and Dania Gurira is as equally hard ass as Nyong'o in the role of Okoye: The leader of Wakanda's all-female fighting force. The breakout Get Out star Daniel Kaluuya plays W'Kabi, the Wakandian government official who teeters between good and evil Letitia Wright plays Shuri, the witty and whip-smart younger sister/assistant to T'Challa. Wright is the movie's comic relief, and she is amazing at it! Some of the best lines from the movie are said by her. Andy Serkis, Forest Whitaker, and Angela Basset also star as the villainous cyborg terrorist Klaue, the mysterious Wakandian prophet Zuri, and the positive, mentoring, mother of T'Challa. The only bad thing is Martin Freeman's character Everett K. Ross: The very confused stalwart American CIA agent who accidentally figures out the secrets of Wakanda. His character seems a little-taped on. But on the plus side, Wakanda is beautiful. Through a combination of set pieces and CGI, the film makers were able to create a vividly beautiful country that looks very real and will probably be the standard for futuristic cities in the future for movies. Ryan Coogler is an amazing director, his vision permeates pretty much the entire movie. The entire movie is also packed with breathtaking Matrix-style action sequences that are fueled by adrenaline and CGI. The best is probably the South Korean car chase sequence or the fight between Black Panther and T'Challa. The final battle sequence is also not-to-be-missed as well. And, as always, the special effects are also great. And, on an ending note, the soundtrack (which includes All the Stars by SZA and Kendrick Lamar, Pray for Me by The Weeknd and Kendrick Lamar, and King's Dead by Jay Rock, Kendrick Lamar, Future, and James Blake) is downright amazing! It mixes African drumming with rap with orchestra. Now that is a feat. There is also a brilliant mid-movie twist but I won't spoil it for you. But, with all that being said, Black Panther truly sets a new standard for Marvel and will reign for the rest of time as a masterpiece."

"bora_mustafa","7","1","2","11 April 2018"," Not particularly a great movie, but not as bad as some say either!!
","Out of all the recent Marvel movies to be released, Black Panther is the one I was looking forward to the most. Black Panther is a Marvel character that I was very unfamiliar with (much like Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch and pretty much all of the guardians of the galaxy characters, etc), so I was very keen to see its own solo movie and I will say that the film is entertaining and the action scenes are decent, though not as impressive as the fights involving Black Panther in the previous Captain America movie, Civil War. <br/><br/>I won't go into too much detail, but basically the movie is about T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) becoming the King of Wakanda (a secret society hidden within the mountains and forest) who is then challenged by Kilmonger (Michael B Jordan) a rebel who believes that he has been abandoned by his people and starts planning to take over Wakanda as its leader. The supporting cast are all good and I'm always happy to see Angela Bassett, in any movie.<br/><br/>If there are weaknesses to the film, I would say that it's mainly to do with some of the characters, there really is not much development with them, especially with Kilmonger. Those who complain about the lack of an origin story, do not forget we did get some of that with the Civil War movie and Black Panther basically continues on from there. <br/><br/>Overall, it's an entertaining movie certainly worth watching and for me, a better movie than either of the guardians of the galaxy movies (yeah as you can tell I can't stand those movies)."

"hunter-friesen","6","1","2","7 April 2018"," Not as good at the hype suggests, but still a solid chapter in the MCU
","Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther was one of the best characters in 2016's Captain America: Civil War. He was the ultimate hero; cool, confident, and determined to stop evil. Two years later, he's starring in his own film that shifts him into the leading role. While not being the best superhero film or even an overall good film, Black Panther is still a solid experience that makes for another adequate chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>The film follows the reign of T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), aka the Black Panther, over the country of Wakanda. On the surface, Wakanda is a poverty-stricken country, but behind smoke and mirrors, it is revealed that it is actually the most advanced civilization on earth. This advancement comes from the extraterrestrial metal vibranium, which landed in Wakanda thousands of years ago and allowed them to advance further than anyone else. Fearing the outside world, they isolated themselves inside a hologram projection system, never allowing themselves to open up to the rest of humanity. <br/><br/>T'Challa is a firm believer of isolation, but his views are challenged by a new wave of Wakandans, ones led by the villain Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan, marking his third collaboration with Coogler). They see the world as weak and ripe for conquest. A rebellion soon breaks out that threatens to tear families and ties apart, as well as the whole of Wakanda. <br/><br/>For boasting a revolutionary cast and director of newcomer Ryan Coogler, Black Panther never really feels original. It very much follows the typical superhero formula where the hero saves the day at first, a villain emerges and beats the hero, hero and his team regroup to fight back, and finally, hero returns and overcomes previous obstacle to beat the villain. I know almost every superhero film follows this formula, but this film was sold on the message that it would be different than the rest, when in fact it's the same as everyone else. <br/><br/>Black Panther also has trouble with inconsistency when it comes to dialogue. The range of quality is all over the place as some lines are delivered really well and some are really poor. The script felt like it was written a couple years ago and never updated. Some of the jokes fall flat because they rely on trends that have faded away, such as the ""What are those!"" joke that was old a few years ago. <br/><br/>Where the film stumbles in writing and storytelling it makes up for in its wide range of characters that piece everything together. There's a rule that no hero can truly work alone and that rule definitely applies to T'Challa as he is aided in his journey by his sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), a tech whiz that serves as the Q to his 007, and Okoye (Danai Gurira), a fierce warrior that never backs down from a fight. Also acting as support is T'Challa's queen mother Romonda (Angela Bassett) and his spiritual advisor Zuri (Forest Whitaker).<br/><br/>Technically speaking, Black Panther does have some of the highest production quality of the MCU films. Having the setting of Wakanda allows the film to embrace colorful and lush natural locations. The visual effects used to create the world are really well done and the expert cinematography by Rachel Morrison really adds to the experience. <br/><br/>About every actor brings their game here. Chadwick Boseman is the standout as T'Challa. He delivers on making his character believable. He's a king and hero, but also just a man thrust into a hard position very quickly. He has his flaws and Boseman highlights those perfectly. <br/><br/>Playing his polar opposite is Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger, who is probably the most complex character. He's an outcast Wakandan who was abandoned in America during the 90s. Now after becoming almost a living legend among criminals, he's come to take his revenge on Wakanda. Jordan brings the rage and molds his character really well to fit the circumstances. <br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast fill in nicely, except for Forest Whitaker who is caught here trying too hard as always. <br/><br/>Many will find Ryan Coogler's Black Panther to be a breath of fresh air for the superhero genre. It's an aesthetically pleasing film, but it's not one to jump and clap for. It never lives up to the hype but the film still never has below average quality. Avengers: Infinity War is boasting one of the biggest casts of all time, and having the Black Panther and Wakanda included is something that is going to be great to see."

","This movies is trying to get across a moral point, not just one guy trying to take over the country as revenge for his father's murder.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie has a great concept and story, and is different to what you would expected from a typical marvel movie. However, the movie at times does seem rather dull, hence why i only gave it a 6.<br/><br/>I thought the ""villain"" in Killlmonger was quite well developed and was rather unfairly put across as an evil villain. While he's undoubtedly committed horrible crimes, he's actually fighting for a very very credible reason. This man was left in a poor black neighbourhood in LA when his father was murdered and had to endure the discrimination and poor standard of livings, black people had to endure in the 80s and 90s in the USA.<br/><br/>He wanted to use Wakanda's money and resources to improve the lives of black people (and then in his extreme ambition of fighting back). Wakanda itself is quite shamefully holding back its money and resources from the world and even from its own people (!!) just to make them look like a third world country so they can have the unknown technological advantage over the world with their vibranium metal and gadgets.<br/><br/>In the end, despite failing to overtake Wakanda, Killmonger manages to change the minds of the ignorant Wakandan people and they set up outreach centres in LA (debatable choice, considering all the places in Wakanda itself).<br/><br/>Therefore, while the film can be a bit dragging and maybe some of the African tribal scenes were a bit over the top, where I felt it was a bit offensive, it was a good movie and enjoyable but with also a deeper meaning.<br/><br/>However, I was hoping for something more cheerful and marvel-like, something which Thor: Ragnarok pulled off brilliantly, it was a pleasant surprise and change to the regular marvel formula."

","Following the hype train for months prior to the release of this movie, I was excited to watch this. After the release of the movie, it received sparkling remarks from everyone I spoke to and the most popular being ""Best superhero movie ever"". I never believed that would be true and after I finally watched it, I could not have been angrier. This movie is overrated and overhyped. The plot feels shallow and doesn't actually kick in till halfway through the movie. Felt like a classic Disney movie made for children. The villain was hyped and as being the most ""relatable"". Yes, he's more relatable than a living planet but relating to KIllmonger is like relating to the leaders of most terrorist organizations in the world today. (No joke, they literally have the same motivations and goals as he does). Michael B. Jordan's portrayal was unconvincing, bland and the furthest thing from funny when he delivered his one-liners. The main character of the movie was boring and weak. He needed to be bailed out of almost every fight he got into. The movie tried to be funny but could not deliver on that aspect. The CGI and sound design looked like they were ripped out of a video game on a Playstation 3.

","To view the with-it and all-the-rage BLACK PANTHER's record-breaking phenomenon through an outside-the-stateside perspective, there is a sadness in our desensitized force-feeding by those ballooning superhero tentpoles whose by-the-numbers narrative, churned out in a rigidly formulaic mode, gingerly cleaves to its comic strip origin, a populist black-or-white world-view and nothing is in the gray area, heck, relative to which, BLACK PANTHER is not an anomaly. <br/><br/>In a fictive African nation Wakanda, which poses as a third-world country but is endowed with cutting-edge technology by virtue of its natural reserves of an omnipotent metal named ""vibranium"" (the metaphor is self-evident), T'Challa (Boseman) takes over the throne after the death of his father King T'Chaka (John and Atandwa Kani in different time frames), which occurred in CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR (2016), and soon finds himself facing the challenge from Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens (Jordan), the son of his uncle N'Jobu (Brown), who is spoiling for avenging his father's death in the hand of T'Chaka and indeed he successfully dethrones T'Challa in the duel. But, crippled by the time-worn slight of many a villain before him, he pulls his punch in the coup-de-grâce which doesn't immediately dispatch T'Challa (it pains this reviewer to watch that falling off a cliff never actually kills the protagonist) as audience placidly anticipates the latter to rise like a phoenix from the ashes to recoup his final victory by executing a fratricide just like his father.<br/><br/>However by-the-book the story unfolds and segues, director Ryan Coogler vamps up the film with a scintillating visual-scape which foregrounds the spectacular world-building of Wakanda, drawing on the African land's exotic scenery and its tribes' indigenous looks and accoutrements, beautifully marries the tradition with the streamlined futurity, an action piece set in South Korea induces the right dosage of spills and thrills (a step up of virtual reality and driver-less car), and effectually whisks away Martin Freeman's agent Everett Ross to a place where he can viscerally experience the sticking-out-like-a-sore-thumb otherness, not without self-abasing humor to hit home its message. <br/><br/> Essentially what benefits BLACK PANTHER greatly is the fact that it is woke enough to centralize a cohort of black superheroes and especially cautious to not let its female characters eclipsed below the masculine shadows. Both Danai Gurira's ballsy virago Okoye and Letitia Wright's gizmo-savvy princess Shuri are inspirational characters and can-do warriors, which dwarfs Lupita Nyong'o's Nakia into awkwardly comporting herself within a more conventional love interest cubbyhole. With that in mind, then it appears there is a crying shame to leave a geared-up Queen Mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett) out of the battle completely, an imposing Bassett shouldn't be all toned up just to fit the garment, maybe ageism is next-in-line as the genre's bullet-point obstacle, considering elderly folks in the comic books rarely live to a privileged death of natural cause (including a venerated Forest Whitaker here to extract empathy). <br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman makes for a very fine hero, majestic in stance and feline in motion, Michael B. Jordan, on the other hand, has a more naturally hunky stature and finishes off the antagonistic job with spanking commitment. Only, this reviewer has to quibble about their final smackdown, and floats a comparison with the climatic fistfight adjacent to a zippily streaking train in Wong Kar-Wai's THE GRANDMASTER (2013), for all its kinetic momentum, is the former a homage to the latter, or a less enlivening show piece that doesn't necessarily live up to all the awesomeness preceding it? Either case, ""don't believe the hype"" is always the ultimate maxim any film lover should religiously abide by."

","I was quite hesitant going into Black Panther. It quickly brought on a nice change of pace compared to other MCU films.

"MovieManChuck","Null","1","2","25 March 2018"," The evolution of MCU
","4/4<br/><br/>Every aspect of this film was absolutely spectacular. This is not only one of the absolute best superhero movies of all time, this is Marvel expanding it's audience beyond movie and comic-book enthusiasts. It is also catering to the African-American community. And seriously, I think we can all agree that it was about time for a black superhero. Am I right?<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman delivers a very convincing performance as T'Challa, never once was I in doubt of the native-African accent. Another MCU trademark (a good amount of movies can't seem to do this), the lead actor is truly the best actor. Also, they have a Grade-A director that brings out the performances tenfold. The one overall thing I felt lacking in this movie was the signature wit I've come to expect in a Marvel movie. The few jokes seemed to miss fire more than make contact, which is unfortunate, because the movie was so good otherwise.<br/><br/>As far as the cinematography goes, it is the most color filled eye candy around. The special effects are the Segway to the plot. The colors have a realistic feel with a slightly surreal and other-worldly tint (Well after all, Wakunda is another world) It's an absolutely beautiful film.
However, the way they shot the beginning sequence in Oakland was irritating. It was a low-light rapid transition hat I totally missed into the jungles of Africa. However, it was revealed later through a flashback exactly what happened.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is another revolution. Everything from genuine African vibes to compliment Wakunda and ""the challenges"", to The Weeknd for when T'Challa travels to Bangkok. Kendrick Lamar takes the mic in Oakland and teams up with SZA for a more poppy song in the credits. Flawless.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie has an obviously presented message that doesn't dilute the movie. It's a movie about power... but it isn't. It's a film about people of different backgrounds pulling their talents together for the betterment of our world (as evidenced in the final cut scene in the credits). It's worth the $16 to see in the theatre, and they can count on me spending $30 more for the Blu-Ray/Digital Deluxe Combo Pack."

","Finally got around to seeing Black Panther which has been out for a few weeks now. Tried to see it during the opening week, but my regular cinema was the busiest I've ever seen it in the 15 years since it opened. There was no surprise we didn't get in and sure many people suffered similar experience. There is no doubt that the almost entirely black cast and hype certainly packed the the people in. Well done to the guys who marketed the movie.<br/><br/>Black Panther tells the story of the secret African society the Wakanda which is more technologically advanced than the rest of the world. T Challa (the Black Panther) is the heir to the throne and the film focuses on the challenges he faces. The plot is a bit clunky at times, but the film is always watchable. The acting is good and the visuals are particularly good. Sure we'll be seeing plenty more of the Black Panther in future years and looking forward to seeing more."

"rubenhendriksen","6","1","2","17 March 2018"," entertaining, but how so political?
","Just saw it in 3d dolby atmos, curve big screen, nice piece of audiovisual entertainment. The story line and the acting wasn't that great, just ok. I understand this movie is really political in the USA, but I don't really get why this is a black movie, and something for black people to be proud of. The movie is a thin fairytale in the fictitious African kingdom of Wakwanda, so not that weird the cast is African (looking). One of the messages in the film was that Africa was robbed empty by others. There's truth in that and nothing wrong with it being told once in a while. But on the other hand, this can be said about every continent on earth. the last centuries the westerners are the evil do-ers, for example I'm Dutch and the slave trade of the Western Indian Company was repulsive. But before the 17th century western Europe was peripheral, where was plundering and a place where people were made slave and taken away. What I want to say is, I don't really get this playing politics of Hollywood. I find it most of the time quite pretentious, embarrassing, arbitrary and mark missing. Concerning this particular movie, to me it wasn't that (bothering) political. This movie made me think of Avatar, the nice visuals and also somewhat story wise."
"matthewparratt009","8","1","2","12 March 2018"," Is this film overhyped?
","This film was brilliant, but did it live up to the hype?<br/><br/>
I went into black panther expecting little, this is comparable to films such as Ant Man and Dr. Strange, both of which I was pleasantly surprised by, I feel this is because they were unknow, almost like underdog heroes when it comes to the MCU.
For me black panther started off a little slow, granted it was necessary for the story development and did show off some of the power and gadgets they have to offer. The moment Michael B. Jordan made his appearance was where things started to get exciting. Seeing him playing the role of antagonist was amazing, the way that killmonger was played, in my eyes, was perfect, the way he looks, his story of vengeance, his attitude towards Wakanda and how he feels it develop the world. A great rival to the black panther and the Wakandan throne.<br/><br/>
Now, having praised the primary villain, I need to comment on Ulysses Klaude. The most useless character in this film... not at all needed. I understand he provided a bit of comic relief, and I'm not going to deny he was slightly entertaining but personally I would have liked to have seen more development of killmonger than Ulysses, thankfully he doesn't last too long.
Having said this, I do think that the casting featuring some of the better young talents featured in black mirror, Danial Kaluuya and Letitia Wright, was outstanding, when they were on the screen they stole the show. Shuri, played by Letitia, provided huge amounts of humour, but also showed how strong she and all the females of Wakanda were, very empowering. 
Martian Freeman, I'm not going to say a lot about him, however I think what they've done here is take a character who for the most part was disliked in Civil War, and made him much more likeable, just developing him a bit more. Even if I still can't get past the terrible accent.<br/><br/>
The special effects featured in this, in one word, outstanding. I think that they did a brilliant job of making this visually stimulating city, hidden under a mountain, showing Africa as we know it but having huge developments, sky scrapers and huge technological advancements. Despite there being these huge structures and it almost being like a first world country, they did a remarkable job of portraying the culture over there, from the costume design to the amazing sound track
Having praised the actors and SOME of the characters, I still feel that this film was missing a lot, considering the film was over 2 hours long, not a lot really happened. and the first half was pointless because it was about Ulysses, a side villain, who end up dying anyway. After that pointless side quest the main story starts and just feels far too rushed. Everything happened over the space of about half an hour.<br/><br/>
I came out satisfied with this film, you don't go into a MCU film expecting an Oscar nominated film, despite this film being nominated. It was fun, like all Marvel films and fitted into the Cannon quite well. I like Black Panther as a hero and look forward to seeing him in Infinity War. like a lot of films, it sometimes takes time to appreciate aspects you don't see at the time of watching, engrossed in the story. Like the amazing colours, music and effects it brings, not to forget how amazing the characters were. Sure, it lacked a bit of substance, but I can get over that by knowing how as far as visuals are concerned it was a masterpiece. If anything, id argue that this is underhyped, some people just can't reflect and see this for the artwork that is it.<br/><br/>
At the end of the day id give Black Panther 8/10."
"tejulll","8","1","2","12 March 2018"," An absolutely Superhero Movie
","I love the storyline so much. Marvel has done a very good movie. So many things are unexpected, but the story is so predictable. This film shows 2 guys with their own principle, fighting for Wakanda. Killmonger are damn right about what Wakanda are supposed to be, but inside him, because his anger for his father's death, he had a wrong method. So, T'Challa are here to make it right.<br/><br/>Marvel's character has so many potential good story, i hope Marvel's next film are better than Black Panther."
"listofnames","6","1","2","11 March 2018"," Average
","Overall its a bit disappointing and the story isn't very believable. The lead villlian is a bit of a caricature who lacks any real motivation other than being a resentful child with daddy issues. <br/><br/>One of the most annoying aspects for me is that the fight choreography is generally quite poor. Unforigiveable for a film like this! Super quick editing and super close camera work make fight scenes impossible to follow. The final 'big fight scene' between the 2 panthers is just by the numbers genericness and quite possibly completely CGI. <br/><br/>The actresses/characters who play the tough and loyal General and Black panthers technological genius sister are the most interesting and unique in the film. While the actor who plays the Black Panther just about carries it off. <br/><br/>One of the most interesting aspect of the film is the idea of Wakanda. A futuristic city hidden in the middle of Africa. Its a nice idea and kind of joyous celebration of African culture and uniqueness. Though one might object to the fairly incongruent mash of traditional tribal stereotypes and futuristic technology. It's not overly believable. But it is a sci-fi fantasy after all. <br/><br/>Overall I'd say it's one of the weaker Marvel superhero films but still entertaining enough if you can forgive some of the sillier African stereotypes."
"ray_page","7","1","2","11 March 2018"," Good, but not great.

"mrrexx","8","1","2","11 March 2018"," Just an opinion.
","Impromptu Black panther review (no spoilers not even really a review just an opinion of mine). Its a must watch, even if your not a marvel fan go see it. I rewatched yesterday and I must say Ryan coogler (director) and Chadwick boseman (protagonist) are geniuses (as well as the whole cast). People say Chadwick was overshadowed by such strong supporting actors and actresses and that's hard to argue with. Danai Gurira absolutely stole the show in my opinion, Letitia Wright was hilarious and a great addition to the marvel roster, Andy Serkis absolutely nailed it, Winston Duke had an amazing Hollywood debut and Michael b Jordan was probably the most developed, sadistic yet relatable villain in the marvel cinematic universe so far. but since rewatching I'm starting to think this choice was intentional. I feel like with it being marvel it was bound for success from the start. come on, a marvel movie in 2018 is going to bring in the crowd regardless. I believe Ryan and Chadwick were well aware of this so Chadwick purposely took a backseat role in his own movie to really let the others shine I believe as a kind of nod to the audience and studio executives kind of like 'hey look what a predominantly black cast of relatively unknown actors can achieve with a big budget and some creative freedom'. Not to take anything away from him though his performance was great. I'm a big fan of black panther and I think his portrayal was spot on. Noble, Deep thinking and calculated. even his arc in the movie is really deep and well thought out dealing with death, grief, lies and betrayal. he just plays it quite low key and reserved so as not to overshadow anyone but in a way that totally works and matches the black panthers character. Overall the film was a complete success commercially and financially, and I think now the world (and Hollywood) has been shown what is possible and what black people in the movie industry can achieve it should open up a world of opportunity for more film's like this to be made. And shout out to the marvel higher ups for letting coogler and others make the film they wanted. Don't really know how to end this and I feel like I'm rambling now soooo... Rating out of ten - the film itself for me is a 8.9/10 would be a nine but I felt some of the CG was slightly underwhelming. For pure spirit, fun and an amazing cast it's 10/10 question."

3) The good vs evil aspect typical of comic books, wrapped up all loose ends.

"mollyyhandleyy","8","1","2","27 February 2018"," Solid for a Marvel film.
","I think it's easy to pick out for yourself the quality negative reviews here as opposed to the more...basely...motivated ones. For me, the film was a great addition to the Marvel film universe. One can only take more of the same scenery, same villains, same ""high stakes"". I think this was fresh and successful in it's goal. I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the laughs, and I enjoyed that the laughs and the film were for a broader audience. The villain was much more compelling than your run of the mill Marvel villains and he delivered a line towards the end that made me cry with empathy. The film wasn't black and white, which is where I think it won me over. There's nothing I despise more than an average, black and white, superhero film. There was a lot of grey and nuance here. While some characters could have had more opportunity to shine (the queen, for example), I think this was ultimately a successful and worth watching film. The scenery was beautiful, costuming was executed fantastically, the score was great, the female characters were fleshed out and I really enjoyed the main ""romance"" where I do not usually. Certainly near the top of the Marvel pile."
"Ehrgeiz","6","1","2","26 February 2018"," Solid but nothing more
","The real star in the movie ""Black Panther"", as I took it, should have been Wakanda. You have this super-powerful but cloaked little technology empire inmidst of Africa. Sure this movie is about Black Panther but it is also a lot about questions like those: should Wakanda be isolated since this worked, or open up its technology to other countries? Should it help out expat Wakandans or weaker countries or refugees? Unfortunately, this movie fails to really sell those points. The characters talk about it, but fail to show it. <br/><br/>On the pro-side of ""Black Panther"", there is mainly the stellar cast. Chadwick Boseman, Forest Whitaker, Lupita Nyongo, Martin Freeman, Serkis, all great actors. The discovery here is Letitia Wright as T'challas bubbly sister. <br/><br/>The movie plays it pretty straight and thats unfortunate. There is nothing really bad about the plot except that Killmongers story does at parts not fit perfectly in. 
But as hard they tried to sell Wakanda as amazing place, its somehow unimaginative especially when this movie is pitted back to back with Thor 3. It never comes to live the same way as the Grandmasters Junkyard/gladiator planet. <br/><br/>They fall short also to sell Killmonger as villain. Its a tragic character, he has his birthright and his life was taken away by the ""good guys"". But they miss the opportunity to give him he more leverage; he longs to see Wakanda but when gets there he just does run-off-the-mill evil villainry. It would be much more interesting if this was a guy who would be actually hard to fight for Black Panther. <br/><br/>Also, Serkis has the time of his life playing a wacko gangster and he gives a scene-chewing performance in the style of guys like Christopher Walken or Nicholas Cage which makes Michael B. Anthony almost look bland in comparison. <br/><br/>Surely, Black Panther suffers a bit from Marvel oversaturation. The origin story was a bit similar to Thor I; the action scenes don't offer much new against the amazing fights in ""Winter Soldier""; and even the stakes are not so high, there is no ""aliens or a super weapon"" are destroying the world. It says something if even the typical Marvel spoilers in the end credits are relatively un-revealing."
"rbr-41299","7","1","2","26 February 2018"," Wakanda and Naïve Globalism
","Marvel has scored another hit at the box office, as well as among movie critics. I read some reviews before seeing the movie and was surprised at the wide range of ratings. Going in I was willing to give it a ""7"" going in, just because it is Marvel. I haven't seen a bad Marvel movie yet. Black Panther was no exception, yet it possessed a strange dualism. On the one hand, the movie was superbly made, cleverly written, possessing great cinematography, exciting special effects, top-notch acting by all the principals and several moments of laugh-out-loud humor. I would not be surprised if Black Panther received Oscar nominations for more than special effects.<br/><br/>On the other side I felt, as a Conservative, that Coogler and Cole were intent on lecturing me from their Leftist-Globalist political ideology. There were subtle but obvious jabs at the Trump Administration. I suppose we should give T'Challa some slack since he is so new at governing. He (indeed the entire MCU) ignores the threat of Radical Islam and he hasn't considered what he would do if millions of illegal immigrants showed up at the gates of Wakanda for their slice of the pie. Killmonger did offer a valid reality check that as soon as the world became aware of Wakanda's scientific advancements, other powers would want to come and take it away from them.<br/><br/>Wakanda, of course, is a fantasy. While it seeks to reflect African culture and succeeds in various ways, it fails to represent the diversity of the continent of Africa. Many times in the movie speech patterns, idiomatic expressions and mannerisms reflect black culture in America rather than Africa. One aspect that is accurate is inter-tribal competition, which in the history of Africa resulted in internecine warfare. Africans have not historically manifested the philosophy of ""one tribe."" ""White people"" are presented in the film as colonizers (which Everett Ross rejects), but ignored is the fact that Christian missionaries brought medicine, hospitals, schools and improved agriculture. Yes, white people engaged in the horrific slave trade, but conversely white people ended it. White people have given over and over for the good of Africa and Africa is the better for it.<br/><br/>Frankly, I liked Black Panther better in Captain America: Civil War where he wasn't preaching at us. I wonder if he will try his Liberal ideology on Thanos. Nah. Thanos does not believe in sharing the wealth."

"ssunny-social","6","1","2","26 February 2018"," Good Film, But Still Over-Hyped
","Black Panther did garner many whistles with its brief appearance in Civil War. MCU left no stone unturned in investing above $200 m in the film which is huge considering its not as popular as other super heroes. But last few months it has generated so much hype that, the box office estimates have gone over the roofs.<br/><br/>The same hype made me crazy enough to not able to contain my excitement and subsequently find out what the fuss is all about. Strangely, even when the film is done I am still asking the same question. Black Panther starts off with one of the most important scenes of the film that becomes the fulcrum on which it develops its plot post mid-way. The story without spoilers is basically about a precious metal, Vibranium which is the root reason of the secret city, Wakanda's technological advancement and power. It is about whether it should be available to the people around the world for other countries' problems and if yes, who gets to decide the right people who should lay hands on the massive power. And if no, then is it really right to continue its use for the selfish well-being of Wakanda alone?<br/><br/>
Keeping all the hype aside (Rotten Tomatoes' 97% score, Box Office), I found the film strictly just ""good"". The characters are well developed, Wakanda city has been beautifully realized and the conventional Marvel wit adds to the charm of the whole. But the film never really takes off to build enough tension to keep us engrossingly glued. It is more of an exhibition of the tribes of Africa and their rich persevered culture. It also makes clear statements of racist atrocities and its payback, whether it is Killmonger screaming his lungs on how T'Challa should use the power of Vibranium for ""their people"" or the frequent use of ""these Americans"" in a form of their subjugation to the Wakandians. With past few Marvel films showing an individualistic innovative style of action, this film fails to offer anything that impresses you beyond the anchoring use of claws. More than the Black Panther or Killmonger, it is Andy Serkins' Ulysses Klaue that steals away your attention with captivating screen presence of a chilled maniac. Unfortunately, the appearance is limited to brief after which Killmonger takes over. Killmonger played by Michael Jordan feels like an immature street punk hip-hopping away his dialogues. When he starts talking, all you feel like saying is, ""You just lack some knuckle slaps when you were growing up"". His motivation is without depth or understanding, its too outlined to generate any taste for the villain. Even T'Challa, whether he played a king or even a super hero, always felt like a character who is undergoing a 2 month course with his shrink for confidence issues. The music shifts gears in discontinued forms from rap beats to African tribal and the usual loud score for action sequences.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is an entertaining pass time for the well etched characters and the relationships among them, some unexpected comical expressions that was very subtly fit into the writing and a refreshing change from the usual we have been coming across."
"tomgillespie2002","8","1","2","26 February 2018"," Marvel unleash a game-changer
","When Marvel first announced they would finally be giving their most popular African-based superhero a most overdue solo outing, audiences and critics alike clocked straight away just how important the film would be, not only in the superhero genre, but for mainstream film-making as a whole. In recent years, social media has raised huge question marks over an industry that had been, and still is, failing to honour both women and ethnic minorities in movies, with last year's Wonder Woman being the first superhero movie of note to tackle the issue head-on, delivering astonishing results in the process. Black Panther is not the first black superhero lead - see the likes of Spawn, Blade and Catwoman - but it is the first to truly celebrate African culture and specifically focus on the 'Black Experience'. The results are, again, truly astonishing.<br/><br/>Marvel has unleashed a game-changer, and one that is well on its way to becoming one of the highest-grossing movies of all time. But this was never really in doubt when they announced that Ryan Coogler, the enormously talented director behind Fruitvale Station and Creed, would be behind the camera, and expectations then soared as soon as the jaw-dropping trailer hit, which was our first real look at the vibrant and fantastical fictional African country of Wakanda. With Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa aka the Black Panther introduced two years ago in Captain American: Civil War, Coogler has been spared the need for origin story mechanics and has free reign to explore this previously unseen world. The big joke is that the rest of the world think of Wakanda as a third-world country full of goats and farmers, when in fact their technological advancements put everyone else to shame. Yet they choose to keep their major discovery - a crashed meteor carrying mystical substance vibranium - a secret for generations. After a brief read of African history, you can understand why.<br/><br/>So their country is a dazzling, futuristic sight, yet the Wakandans still honour the traditions of their ancestors. With their former king T'Chaka (John Kani) dead at the hands of Daniel Bruhl's Zemo, his son T'Challa has returned to Wakanda to receive his crown. He wants his old flame and active spy Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) there for his big day, and his sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), a science boffin who trumps the likes of Tony Stark and Bruce Banner in terms of intelligence and innovation, teases her older brother. Despite an initial reluctance, T'Challa is a willing and capable leader, both politically and physically, able to defend any challengers without the aid of the enhance powers of the Black Panther. While the lack of having to watch the protagonist wrestle with their feelings as they step up to a bigger responsibility is certainly refreshing, the lack of any real arc for T'Challa is one of the very problems with Black Panther. With a supporting cast so vast and impressive, T'Challa often gets drowned out of his own story.<br/><br/>Still, the supporting cast, which includes the likes of Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, Daniel Kaluuya, Andy Serkis and Winston Duke, certainly deliver. Wright near steals the film, and Duke, as rival tribe leader M'Baku, makes a big impression in a relatively short amount of time. But a Marvel film wouldn't be complete without a big bad, and Michael B. Jordan's Eric Killmonger is easily their most complex, imposing and sympathetic since Loki. To say more about his character would be giving away spoilers, but Coogler and co-writer Joe Robert Cole lay out his motivation and execution with real precision, and Jordan proves to be a thoroughly menacing presence. The cast, which is one of the best assembled in recent memory, help Cooger sculpt this fascinating world of progression and tradition, and even when the film can't help but indulge in a climax of CGI fisticuffs, you'll remain immersed because you'll care about the characters. Black Panther does something no other superhero has done before it - for me at least - and resonates long after the credits roll, proving timely in exploring the question of whether to build bridges or walls.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","Great Superhero movie, I really feel it is the aesthetic of the movie that was it's saving grace. The African Cyberpunk society they created in Wakanda was very interesting and visually pleasing.<br/><br/>That being said the plot was predictable, and very stock. I feel like there wasn't very many chances taken on the actual film and I feel like a second Black Panther movie could be truly a masterpiece if they dedicated the storytelling they have in some of their more successful films like Guardians.<br/><br/>Overall 8/10, not the best superhero movie of the century but you will not be disappointed you saw it in theaters."

","Looking at the 1 star reviews exemplifies why this movie is important. This is far, FAR from the worst Marvel movie even if it's not the best as well, but it's definitely alongside the better ones because of how great the villain is and how effective and well realized Wakanda is as a scenario and a plot device, which makes the overall story stand out among other superhero flicks. <br/><br/>Those that complain about the politics are stupid since it's an integral element of the characters. That said, only if you have some prejudice this aspect would trigger you since in it's heart this is still an action blockbuster focused in entertainment and it delivers, there's a ton a charm in the cast and the film is fluid and fun, the moving scenes are poignant without dragging and the comedy is used with precision, don't expect another Ragnarok.<br/><br/>The worse about the movie is that it is a bit predictable and some visual fx look a bit dated but hardly something that would completely ruin my enjoyment. Wakanda Forever!"
"prathikofficial","8","1","2","26 February 2018"," Clawing its niche in the MCU
","I went to watch this movie a week late, and by then I had heard rave reviews about it. These ranged from how it's a swansong for the colored peoples to how Killmonger was the best MCU villain of all time. To be frank, it was neither. In fact, it is safe to say that Tom Hiddlestone's Loki is still the best in the MCU with close competition from David Tennant's Killgrave (Purple Man).<br/><br/>The point of this entire movie is to show the story behind the mysterious ruler of Wakanda, and it does this quite beautifully. (However, I could not really enjoy the little details in the visuals because of a really annoying kid sitting next to me while I was watching it.) The idea behind the visuals though was exquisite. There was something beautiful about the way that the city was shown, and at this point I would rather go there than Asgard. The only thing that bothers me about this movie is that T'Challa kills Killmonger because he wanted to open the doors of Wakanda, only to end up doing the same thing in order to woo Nakia.<br/><br/>The characterization of the colored in Hollywood movies has always bothered me. Even in this movie, the only white man to actually be in the entire movie is a war hero, rather than the coward he is in the source material. Killmonger happens to be a beautifully written character, even in the comics. None of the charm of that character is from the actor. In fact, I believe that a child in the same role would have shown a similar emotional range. The anger and mystery we had come to adore about T'Challa (in Civil War) vanishes with this movie. He becomes a King and that takes away his warrior spirit (so to speak). <br/><br/>I think it's safe to say now that when Tony Stark dies (we all know he is, so just accept it), Shuri will be the best person to take over as the brains of the Avengers. Nakia is probably the least irritating female lead in a Marvel movie. Maybe it's just that she doesn't whine about the safety of the title character.<br/><br/>The true scene-stealer in this movie is M'Baku (Man-Ape), the leader of the Jabari. Even his quips don't feel out of character, and that is saying something for a Marvel movie. (Please don't watch this movie if you haven't read a single Black Panther comic)<br/><br/>Overall this movie makes for a decent watch. If you are looking to watch this movie to stay updated on the next steps of the MCU, you will be sorely disappointed. The ending is the only thing that even takes the larger universe into account."

"p-jonsson","7","1","2","26 February 2018"," Overhyped as hell but still pretty okay entertainment.
","It was with some hesitation that I went to see this movie. I was afraid that it would be burdened with too much political and social preaching. Especially knowing how much the movie is praised amongst certain factions in our society today. Sure enough there were indeed some of that nonsense but luckily it was much less than I feared.<br/><br/>I actually found the movie fairly entertaining. It is far from great, certainly very far from the insane hype surrounding it, but pretty okay. It is more or less a standard issue super hero movie on a big budget. Of course this means a fairly mediocre underlying story beefed up with lots of action and special effects.<br/><br/>The story itself is a traditional revenge story with some black power stuff. Nothing to write home about but it works as a vehicle for the action and special effects which is what makes this movie. There are the usual nonsense and plot holes in it of course. Like Shuri claiming that Vibranium (silly name but never mind) is instable at high speeds yet they have no problem making flying ships and other fast moving stuff with it.<br/><br/>The characters are a wee bit disappointing as far as the main characters are concerned. I felt that the main protagonist has little in terms of charisma. Killmonger, the main bad guy, was downright disappointing. To me he looked like the stereotype of a dumb thug and mostly he behaved like one. Bloody hell could they not have found an actor that looked less...well...stupid!<br/><br/>Personally the character I liked best was actually Klaue which was pretty cool, insane but cool. The female warriors, which were both kick-ass and smart, and Shuri is also fairly high up on my approval list.<br/><br/>Special effects! This is of course where this movie shines. Overall I think the special effects were good. The design of the various gadgets, ships etc were very nice. The rampaging rhinos in the final fight really made me laugh. I should have seen that coming. I definitely liked all the sonic effects. Obviously this movie would have been more or less null if the special effects would not have been a success.<br/><br/>On the whole Black Panther is a quite enjoyable special effects and action movie. Nothing more, nothing less. Some social preaching nonsense but less than I feared, hum ho story, lots of action and lots of special effects."
"gigitville","9","1","2","26 February 2018"," Marvel Needs to Stay Down This Awesome Path
","I was very excited for this movie for a while. I work at a movie theater, and I never got sick of seeing trailers for it. And fortunately, the movie delivered awesomely. There were a few things I didn't care for, but no movie's perfect.
Starting with the cons. T'Challa's mom didn't really do anything? She should've had some more things to do in the story. Some of the exposition and beginning could've been shortened. I liked that they took their time, but it's almost like they did it too much in the beginning and too little at the end so they could've balanced it out. The ""what are those?!"" comment was just... unnecessary. Come on Marvel. And I wish Michael B. Jordan had more screen time because he was fantastic, the best Marvel villain overall in my opinion, and did an amazing performance. Some of the technology seemed a little far-fetched, and since they didn't expand on how most of it really worked, it makes the characters seem pretty invulnerable at times. Though they counteract it well at some points, like taking away Black Panther's superhuman qualities when he fights for the throne. 
The majority of the movie was the pros. All the performances were great, I don't think there was one character that was acted poorly. Micheal B. Jordan and Chadwick Boseman are both stars that deserve more positive attention, because they're fantastic in everything I've seen them in. This is no exception. Adding onto this, pretty much everyone also wen through character development to some degree, which is unfortunately a rarity in most blockbusters. However, Ryan Coogler is definitely a director that cares about that sort of thing. I certainly want to start a petition for Marvel to hire more directors with visions of their own. Taika Watiti and now Ryan Coogler, very good calls. All the characters were just so well-written, it made me so happy. Especially all the strong and well-written female characters. See Hollywood? It's not hard to do it. It felt so natural and made so much sense, they were all treated with so much respect and I'm over the moon. We need more strong and well-written female role-models in movies, especially those of color. And not all of the, were just ""hot girl who kicks ass and that's it"" either! Yay! I actually found myself wanting more close quarters action, since the stunts and fight choreography were both amazing. The way the love story with T'Challa and Nakia was approached and written was refreshing. It wasn't like literally almost every other Marvel movie where the characters meet in the movie and fall in love within the events of the movie. T'Challa and Nakia had a history, a believable one, and we were rooting for them to get back together. And when they did, it wasn't one of them making a sacrifice for the other. T'Challa offered Nakia a way to fulfill what she wanted while still being close by. One thing I was worried about was they wouldn't blend the traditional African culture with futuristic imagery that well, and that it'd be clunky and unnatural. But this was something that was actually done pretty well, and in a believable way. Overall, fantastic movie."

","I don't write many reviews, but a lot of the reviews I saw on here for this movie seemed to have an agenda so I decided to share a review that has none.<br/><br/>I went in having heard nothing but good things about the movie, and left having thoroughly enjoyed it. The action was solid, exciting. The plot was fairly standard, but had some moments I did not expect, though nothing revolutionary. The villain was strong, compelling and most importantly threatening. The costumes were a wonderful mix of traditional and tribal African clothes blended seamlessly with modern western clothes. They were bright and colorful, and just generally visually appealing. The same goes for Wakanda itself. Michael B. Jordan and Sterling K. Brown both delivered fantastic performances and I can see why Brown has been winning so many awards.<br/><br/>There were some parts that sort of dragged, but really that was my biggest complaint. Overall it was exciting and fun, with some wonderful comedic moments.<br/><br/>I think the message of the film, that we are stronger and better together than we are apart, is timeless. But perhaps applicable now more than ever."

","It continues to amaze me how many unique and interesting plots the MCU can generate. The plot was further enhanced by some of the best acting to date in a Marvel movie. Michael and Chadwick play strong lead characters but the supporting cast stole the show! Danai G, Daniel K, Letitia W, and Winston D were all equally amazing. Each one of these characters could easily have spin offs on Netflix.<br/><br/>This movie similar to Guardians in that a decade ago if you would have told me there would be a Black Panther movie I would have not known much about it other than a comic exists and that the movie would likely fail due to obscurity. Not the case. Honestly, this movie stands solid on its own even outside the MCU. <br/><br/>This ranks near the top of the MCU movies thus far, better than Ant Man, the Thor series, the IronMan sequels, and Ultron (7's and 8's). It's only slightly lower than Avengers, Civil War and Guardians (9's and 10's) but not by much. I'd say it's on par with Winter Soldier which is equally amazing."
"jc-29071","6","1","2","25 February 2018"," remember the message of Dr. King
","I just want to mention that the message of Martin Luther King Jr. won out Malcolm X when they finally met and discussed opposing viewpoints, Malcolm would later change his way of thought and acknowledge that Dr.King was right. After all the message of Dr. King was one grounded in the truth of Jesus Christ and which borrowed from Ghandi's own movement against similar opposition from the English and yielded success, that coupled with the support of JFK who likewise borrowed from Abraham Lincoln and we have a model that cannot be denied. Therefore let us all pray as Dr. King prayed for peace, forgiveness, harmony, oneness, understanding and respect for everyone and everything which is a center piece of the beleifs of Ghandi but which all Christians must likewise support. This movie inadvertently appears at a time when the movie makers decided that enough controversy exist (Captain America's Civil War and last years sad and disturbing KKK riots in Charlottesville, we are not in the 60's anymore! ) in the world that it would generate enough interest and thereby sales to garner success for its efforts. While the marketing strategy succeeded, the moral implications should not be ignored specifically as mentioned above regarding all efforts toward harmony and peace in all areas concerning the social attitudes, beleifs and values of all the peoples living in this great country. It with great hope that the writers show every bit of responsibility in the upcoming films to remember that this is the true direction of a hero such as the one played by Chadwick, is for peace, forgiveness. Letting go of the past and embracing the future as harmonious beings seeking to heal and help each other as we work towards a brighter future must be the aim of our leaders that must be seasoned in the lessons of our past and dutifulminded to steer clear of repeating them, forgiving the wrongs and adhering to the right in our evolution to continue to raise the bar for the human condition. 
 On a side note please make sure that the comic code authority (a guideline to ensure that children would be protected from harmful messages or stories) is restored to comics, there are many comic books that have many harmful messages in them, parents take note that Marvel and DC comics got rid of the comic code Authority when they went corporate in an effort to make more money. Comics were always for children and still are, why are we not more concerned about the safety of their highly impressionable minds, please contact both Marvel and DC comics to pressure them about this issue for it will not go away. 
One last note regarding DC and the new Black Lightning t.v. show, the actor is great but the costume is really lame, he should have a black costume with small yellow lighning bolts near the neck or the left breast and a simple black mask that covers most of his face. The costume could be bullet proof but not mechanical, he is not Iron Man and he can fly via the lightning powers, finally he should make his debut in the Justice League Movie. One more point the actor who plays Martian Manhunter (also an African American actor) is really great in the role as the Martian, except his powers due to a low budget on the Supergirl series expires quickly, can you give him his full powers and have him also in the Justice League movie, he has always been a major character in the series."

","This is a film that is a good addition to the MCU, but it doesn't really bring anything new to the table. This results in the film being quite predictable and bland at times, whilst still remaining enjoyable. <br/><br/>The acting is all very assured, particularly from Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis, Danai Gurira and Martin Freeman. However, Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger is the real star of the show. He is a very compelling villain whose motivations you can understand due to being removed from a culture he should have been allowed to grow up in. Also as he has effectively been set on his path by T'Challa's father killing his father, it creates something that is very Shakespearian.<br/><br/>The theme of ancestry is something I felt was explored very well with how T'Challa realises he can make changes from the decisions of rulers of the past. This then results in Wakanda providing aid to other countries and not isolating itself from the rest of the world, which feels like a very timely message. The melding of traditional African culture with advanced technology was also engaging and visually satisfying.<br/><br/>There are some issues though such as some CGI looked quite fake, some dialogue being clunky, the humour mostly falling flat (The 'What are those' joke was particularly cringeworthy) and Killmonger should have been involved in the narrative a lot more. Overall it's a mostly satisfying superhero film."

","After reading so many reviews on this board and realising how critically blinded some people can really be, (all the haters with no real reason other than 'it's predictable': Like duh, it's a super hero movie not Shakespeare) it made me reflect on the real reason why we watch the hero flicks in the first place - it makes us feel good.<br/><br/>If you want a description of the story you can visit wikipedia. This review is meant for the larger audience and why you should watch the film BUT not alone!<br/><br/>I got a very rare opportunity to be invited to a private screening of Black Panther with the BlackNet community in Singapore by a very close friend of mine. This is the first time I've been to a screening where the excitement rolled out like Thunder on a bright sunny day: Loud, obvious and utterly fun! You can just feel the buzz of life and anticipation as you approach the theatre. People made an effort to dress up and turned up way before the show time to mingle and talk about theories and expectations about the film. So the film starts and this is my take on watching with the hyped crowd: absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>Yes, it is a classic story about good vs bad.
Yes, both good and bad has similar powers.
Yes, he's a black version of Iron man.
The comedy was on point and the one-liners were delivered by a brilliantly talented cast. <br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman delivers an 'uncomfortably perfect' type of the Black Panther where even in his spiritual conflicts, he seems calm and clear headed on what he must do as King. Sure he may be a King but he hides being a man with emotional struggles very well; a little too well. (I find it strange that there didn't seem to be any flaw in his character but sure he's a King right?)
My favourite has to be Michael B Jordan's acting. KillMonger alone may have been a B-rated villain in the comics but it was Michael's portrayal of the Yellow Leopard that really bumped up his presence. More so, his backstory in the MCU is that of a trouble soul and it does reflect on today's current affairs where we see misguided individuals take matters into their own hands.<br/><br/>Apart from the story and the casting, major props go to the beautifully designed sets. Wakanda looks amazingly believable and realistic: almost like our lives could be in the next 25-50 years. Costumes were very well designed and the CGI was original - I literally 'wow' seeing Black Panther's suit form around his body the first time.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast members were equally fantastic and watching with the community, every punch-line was met with loud applause and unified appreciation. I believed the hype and I enjoyed it with them.<br/><br/>As this is the last film before the big cumulation of the Avengers Infinity War, I urge all Marvel fans to watch this! Why you ask? Answer's simple: Vibranium"
"theincrediblehong","7","1","2","24 February 2018"," Overhyped
","It's a pretty good movie but not nearly on par with the original Avengers or Civil War for the best MCU movie. If I were to compare this to another MCU movie I guess it would be Thor. Both T'Challa and Thor are the heir apparent to their kingdoms and must challenger to the throne. However, whereas you could sympathize with Loki's jealously of Thor, the level of hostility that Killmonger has towards T'Challa never seemed appropriate to me. Nor did I totally accept the circumstances surrounding T'Chaka's little secret. <br/><br/>While the film may be worth seeing just to get a better view of the 'black' perspective of the world we live in, these small story details really dragged the movie down a bit for me. I really wished they spent more time with Killmonger's background as he had the potential to provide the most complex character/villain in the MCU universe. But instead we're left with just another standard villain who is overcome with rage and just wants to kill everyone."
"gwyckoff","7","1","2","23 February 2018"," As a cultural moment - 10; As a superhero movie - 6.5
","You have to be suspicious of any movie that sets out to deliberately break new ground. ""Wonder Woman,"" for example, was a pretty good movie but had some flaws. It got a pass from critics because it was the first woman superhero movie. Had it stared Chris Hemsworth or Tom Cruise, it would have been treated much more harshly.<br/><br/>""Black Panther"" does a fabulous job of building a super advanced civilization in the heart of Africa. The depth, complexity and thought that went into all of this was truly delightful. Too bad it could not have been explored in a ""Game of Thrones"" style long-format story ark. As it was, we spend almost half the movie world-building for a disappointingly small payoff in terms of story. The middle drags while so much track is being laid.<br/><br/>The story is OK. ""Iron Man"", by way of comparison, was a great movie because of the main character's growth ark. We saw an immature and deeply flawed Tony Stark come into true adulthood. He emerges from the shadow of his father and faces the truth about the deadly weapons he creates. In ""Black Panther"" we see T'Challa also emerge into true adulthood. He starts as an admirable and nearly perfect Prince and develops into an admirable and slightly more perfect King. The growth ark is interesting but underwhelming.<br/><br/>The truly fascinating character is Killmonger (Michael Jordan) and his sidekick Claw (Andy Serkis). We end up wishing more of the movie had been about them rather than T'Challa's angst over whether to be just noble or really really noble. <br/><br/>Still, definitely worth seeing. The creative detail and near total immersion into alternative African culture makes up for the lackluster character development and predictable story."

","Apart from the fact that this is a major step forward for black representation in movies of this genre, Black Panther actually comes across as that rare beast, an intelligent superhero movie. It certainly resonates with the isolationist politics currently in vogue and offers a critcism against them (with subtle refrences to Trumps ""wall"") but for me it was that the characters themselves (with a notable exception) were well rounded and motivated. The weak link was the character of Klaw. A one dimensional nutter who's only purpose was to be the stock racist South African and to kill people needlessly. In truth a lot of the usual tropes are here love interest, good guy gets defeated good guy comes back, bad guy kills nice people etc. but on the whole it is well done and the visuals especially of Wakanda city are beautiful. I espcially liked the references to African culture which added a nice flavour to the look of the film. On the basis of this I would watch another one."
"stevenrotherforth","6","1","2","22 February 2018"," A decent movie that falters at getting the basic Superhero stuff right.
","The Black Panther <br/><br/>The Black Panther tells the story of T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) the newly crowned king of Wakanda.
A fictional technologically advanced African nation.
T'Challa's throne is challenged by a brutal outsider named Erik Killmonger played by the excellent Michael B Jordan.
He has his own rights to the crown and will stop at nothing to get it.
The safety of Wakandas people are threatened by Killmongers ideas to expose and exploit the resources and technology of their hidden nation.
Only the protector, The Black Panther can stop him.<br/><br/>Not quite the revelation that the hype would have you believe but still a very good entry into the Marvel cinematic universe.
Ryan Cooglers film certainly has its own unique look and flavour that differentiates it from anything that has gone before.
Often a visual feast but there are some jarring effects that will slap the keen eyed audience members in the face.
A particular cliff side scene springs to mind that doesn't best display where the movies 200 million dollar budget has gone.<br/><br/>In many ways The Black Panther is Marvels own take on Batman.
Not quite as dark and serious as the caped crusader but there are some similarities.
He has the coolest gadgets and runs around kicking ass dressed as an animal.
I thoroughly enjoyed Ryan Cooglers movie but unlike his last offering the brilliant Creed, his latest movie isn't as polished.
Black Panther suffers from an overblown first act and a seemingly rushed second and third.
When Killmonger arrives at Wakanda baring a gift that will grant him the right to challenge for the throne the movie begins to pick up pace at an alarming rate. 
By doing so it loses focus on what's needed to drive the story and get the audience all roused up.
T'Challa's defeat at the hands of Killmonger is quickly dealt with.
His road to redemption is even more Spritely handled.
Unlike Rocky Balboa's journey back from defeat in Rocky III or Bruce Wayne's climb back from Banes ass whooping in The Dark Knight Rises, T'Challa is merely given a mouthful of herbal tea and then sent back on his way for his second showdown.
Too much time is spent in the first third of the movie with our hero chasing around the weak villain Ulysses Klaue played effortlessly by Andy Serkis.
Such a brilliant actor who is given an underdeveloped villain to play for a second time in the last twelve months.
Anyone who has seen The Last Jedi will know where I'm coming from.
Putting this aside this movie still manages to succeed due to its fantastic cast and superior direction. A shame then that the action scenes aren't dealt with as slickly as I would have liked.
In Civil War BP's introduction was an awesome one.
His fighting style jumped right off the screen. In this movie he seems less accomplished.
The action scenes are more CGI orientated and often look like
in-game video clips from a PlayStation that fail to trick the eye.
There isn't really a single standout moment regarding action that will linger in the memory.
Even a scene with an armoured stampeding rhino falls by the wayside.
Indeed the Black Panther looked more spectacular when taking on Captain America or his roof top brawl with the Winter soldier in Civil War.
Perhaps the greatest fight scenes are those involving The Walking Dead's Danai Gurira.
Her character Okoye was easily the most bad ass of all in the movie. She could be the next big action star proving she's just as capable with a spear as she is with a Samurai sword.<br/><br/>When all is said and done this movie is still a pretty decent one.
A pretty good one in fact. 
No movie is perfect. Some are just closer than others.
There's lots to get excited about here. The fantastic soundtrack, the sweeping landscapes. The top notch performances by all involved.
On the other hand it's the basic superhero stuff where this film falters a little.
Fight scenes are a bit messy, CGI is a little unpolished in places and certain characters are underdeveloped and under used.
Still I do recommend you go watch it and I'll even probably buy the Blu-ray."
"slightlymad22","7","1","2","22 February 2018"," Liked It, But Didnt Love it
","Going into this, I'll say I've become pretty tired of the established Marvel movie formula, and I'm pretty superheroed out, to be honest. <br/><br/>Pros
1: the entire fate of the world / galaxy / universe is at stake. Not some alien creature yet again destroying some planet / world / universe yet again, until our costumed heroes stop them yet again.
2: Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger. Not just your usual 'Enemy of the Week Who Will Be Dead by the End of the Movie'. His ""you killed my father, prepare to die"" Inigo Montoya routine seemed very same old, same old that the reveal of his motivations initially left me fairly dubious. But Michael B. Jordan is so charismatic he sells it.
3: Letitia Wright's absolutely delightful, scene-stealing performance as Shuri in the film, I hope she is used in other movies. Shuri could schoolTony Stark on technology, and I hope Marvel put this in a movie. Wright's portrayal was a bright spot that lifted the dour moments without becoming just lame comic relief.
4: The supporting cast is solid (Not always the case with Marvel) General Okoye, played by Danai Gurira (Michone from Walking Dead). Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, or Lupita Nyong'o, all of whom are excellent in their respective roles as well.
5: Daniel Kaluuya performance<br/><br/>Cons
1: The combat scenes are a real problem. The casino battle was too dark and difficult to follow what was going on. The final showdown didn't work as well for me. CGI Hero fights someone with identical powers in a different-coloured CGI suit. How many times have we seen that in Marvel movies?? 
2: The CGI was quite poor at times
3: A bit predictable at times. I appreciated the foreshadowing with the introduction of the second suit, though. As soon as it turned up in Shuri's lab, it was obvious what it would be used for
4: Daniel Kaluuya (he is on both lists) The screenplay really doesn't do him any favours at all!! His character arc is basically ""We're best friends!! Wait. You lost one fight with a guy I hate, so I'm supporting your rival. Then, I've changed my mind, let's be friends again now that my side is losing!"" W'Kabi isn't portrayed as a weaselly character that bends whichever way the wind is blowing!! He's just an underwritten character who just goes back and forth as the plot demands.
5: It lacked an emotional connection for me. When Forest Whitaker died it is played out as a moment that should have left us devastated, but I just wasn't bothered. <br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed it, but it's not up there with my top Marvel movies, let alone my favourite superhero movies."
"elainemci-92423","7","1","2","20 February 2018"," Good Film
","Black Panther is a good movie, but not a great movie. The central portion of the film is really good and the characters are all engaging while the villain delivers motivations above and beyond the usual Hollywood standard.<br/><br/>The problems I found with Black Panther really only came at the beginning and end of the story. For me it took quite a while for the story to actually get going (not till Michael Jordan's character shows up in Korea does the the story really start to pick up pace) though as they were establishing both the characters and setting this is perhaps understandable and I would expect this not to be such an issue in subsequent films. The ending I found a little rushed by contrast and wish they had spent slightly less time on the set up and more time on the pay off.<br/><br/>The other major problem I found were with the fight scenes, which I found slightly repetitive; the 'challenge' scenes were quite well done however the confrontation between the hero and villain at the end felt underwhelming, certainly when compared with the rest of the battle taking place elsewhere, that however is not uncommon in Marvel films.<br/><br/>Overall well worth seeing and I look forward to more Black Panther films."

","Took a few days to mull this review over. Visually this as impressive as a Marvel title gets, Wakanda brought to ife and it's beautiful. The let down is the somewhat predictable plot, as the early part of the film plays out it was easy to see how the end was to play out.<br/><br/>This in mind the there is a lot packed into the 2hr 15 runtime, which oddly with the story, you find some parts seem drawn a little too much, leaving the final act far too predicatble and extremley busy.<br/><br/>The casting is good and Michael B Jordan in particular impressive.<br/><br/>It will be interesting to see further development of Black Panther."
"jonnisbas","7","1","2","17 February 2018"," A great theme is not enough
","The theme of the movie was deep and very relevant.
BUTTT
I do not understand why the black panther's strength - both morally and physically was not put into more focus in the movie. i really cannot.
As a warrior in the caliber of Captain America i would expect the movie to give some weight to the fight scenes, unfortunatley T'challa's fights did not have enough focus choreography or proper editing, i never got the sense that he is a good serious fighter.
This is exactley what made captain america cool in the winter soldier.
T'challa did not have character defining choices to make that would let us know that he is dealing with something. the only ""choice"" he made was wether to stay with his ancestors or go back and fight, a choice with no weight on it.
lesset action , movies have made amazing fight scenes.
Logan for example used the action to charge the movie with tension and anticipation. This movie glossed through the fights as though it was a 60's bond movie.
I cannot understand how they blew such a critical part of this movie.

","Black Panther is back after Civil War! Before, I was assured myself that this movie would be the best superhero movie in 2018 if Infinity War wouldn't released in the same year. Now, the outcome is great.<br/><br/>Firstly, I do like the opening scene. It can be said that it's different from other MCU's films. New formula for the next phase, I think. Secondly, please someone give the person whose responsible for the choreography in this movie a lot of cookie. Black Panther isn't a martial art themed superhero but it nailed it. So much better than the choreography in the series of protector of K'un-Lun. Third, the humor. Back in the Ragnarok last year, Marvel served us an action-humor movie. Thus, my expectation is Black Panther will be not so different from Ragnarok. I can't said that this movie will not have any humour. It has precise portion of humour and I totally laughing out loud from its jokes. Last, the cast. Hands down for all the cast. Totally great job, especially you Andy Serkins.<br/><br/>Closing statement. Black Panther is a beautiful superhero movie. The plot, the bgm, and of course the scenery. 9 of 10.<br/><br/>P.S : There are two post-end credit scenes. Just wait. It's worth your time in the second scenes. Ciao."

The movie is also loaded with lots of fun action. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the amazing choreography, especially among the gorgeous warrior women. The movie has a rich cast, filled with gifted actors both familiar and new. Anyone would enjoy this movie, but in particular, any black person, of any age could easilly find inspiration and role models in this movie, not only because it has a black hero with a cool suit and neat technology, but also because of his struggles and responsibilities before and after becoming an African King, which I thought were well projected throughout the movie. There wasn't one character in the film who didn't have a strong significance in one way or another, and The Black Panther respected them all, even those who would seek to destroy him...

"slicedbread117","10","3","12","20 March 2018"," All Hail the King
","Fans have been begging for years to have Marvel bring the world's first ever black superhero to life on the big screen, and Marvel finally brought Black Panther into the massive Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) through 2016's 'Captain America: Civil War', a film which showcased how flawlessly Black Panther could work in film. It was clear that Marvel had a new hit character on their hands, but with the release of Black Panther, I don't think even Marvel had any idea the social impact the film would create. Black Panther (BP) is more than a studiously entertaining superhero film, more than another superb entry into the MCU; Black Panther symbolizes a prominent political statement, a celebration of culture, an enormous racial representation in superhero films and does it all while delivering one of Marvel's most enjoyable films to date.<br/><br/>Marvel could not have chosen a better director/writer than Ryan Coogler, who pieced together a story like none we've seen before in the MCU, a story which is as firmly grounded and thought provoking as it is entertaining. The revelation of the fabled fictional city of Wakanda kick starts the entire story and the film uses its main setting as a vessel into the overall narrative and the characters which inhabit it. Wakanda is truly like a character of its own. The believed-to-be third world county holds a nearly endless supply of the world's most treasured resource, vibranium, which is literally the centerfold around the entire plot and Coogler uses the fictional country to his advantage. Wakanda is easily one of the most enthralling settings I've ever seen in a superhero film and the story feeds off it greatly.<br/><br/>The main narrative oozes with profound themes, exploring real-world issues like isolationism, the costs of colonialism and more, while delivering the exceptional spectacle of a fantastical adventure/fantasy film. There's the insanely advanced technology and superpowers, but it's running through a still somewhat primal, strongly traditional country, and Coogler mixes these elements to near perfection. The movie progresses at a stellar pace, providing well-executed plot twists along the way and eventually bringing its story full circle in a satisfying fashion. There's still sprinkles of that classic Marvel humor, but with a grounded plot, there's more commitment to serious storytelling which is a huge welcome after 2017 was full of comedy-heavy Marvel films. Black Panther is sincerely a tremendous three acts of engaging storytelling and Coogler deserves a great deal of praise for executing such a captivating story.<br/><br/>Black Panther boasts a set of characters more interesting and engaging than arguably any MCU film before it, a strength which propels BP's story to the next level. We see T'Challa's story arc that was launched in Civil War continue here, the struggle of becoming the next king of Wakanda while wrestling with potential division in his own country. T'Challa is a complex, expertly-written lead character whose portrayal by superstar Chadwick Boseman is full of dedication and swagger. Following this dazzling outing, Black Panther is one of the MCU's best characters without question. Opposite T'Challa is a villain who arguably climbs into Marvel's top three villains thus far. Erik Killmonger presents one of Marvel's most emotionally engaging villains yet. Killmonger's story is equally as interesting as any other character; he presents understandable motives and is a grounded, realistically written villain for our current real world. Michael B. Jordan delivers a spectacular performance as T'Challa's nemesis, the stand out character of the whole film. <br/><br/>Black Panther separates from other recent superhero films by giving its main character a true loyal alliance to feed off, which is where the aforementioned set of characters come into play. Wakanda's all-female special force leader, Okoye (Danai Gurira), T'Challa's tech-genius sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) and his ex, now Wakandan spy Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) not only lead the way of a rock solid supporting cast but help give even more proper representation of powerful women in the MCU. Each character is formidable and simply entertaining, and all played wonderfully by their respective actresses. What's such a true victory for BP in the character department is that the auxiliary characters run even deeper. The star power is overwhelming; Sterling K. Brown, Winston Duke, Daniel Kaluuya, Angela Bassett and Forest Whitaker all are simply eccentric. As secondary characters, they may not get loads of screen time, but these characters all fill Wakanda to make it, and the movie, feel alive and full of an actual culture. <br/><br/>Even further, Andy Serkis is vexingly gripping as Ulysses Klaue as his narrative thread continues from Avengers: Age of Ultron and Martin Freeman is a delightfully heartwarming surprise, reprising his role of Everett Ross. This stunning company of rounded, enticing characters is a vitally underrated aspect of Black Panther, and the acting cast is one for the ages.<br/><br/>It's easy to stay brief while discussing action and visuals in Marvel films, since their track record is one of the best in those departments. Black Panther is a visual treat. The astounding mix of traditional African culture and futuristic technology found in Wakanda make way for a show stopping atmosphere, filled with eye-popping colors and superb costume design. The CGI is gorgeous and even better with the mix of Marvel's amazing practical effects. More impressive to me, however, was the audible side of the film. MCU movies always have a solid, if safe score to work behind the acting but BP takes a great stride towards more recognizable scores. Like the visuals, the mix of traditional African drumming through djembes among others with the modern hip-hop of Kendrick Lamar, is emotionally riveting, giving intensity to the action scenes. Said action sequences are nothing short of fun; anchored by uniquely written situations and high-level choreography, the action is simply a blast.<br/><br/>This film has it all. The gloriously stunning atmosphere of Wakanda provides an enthralling visual and audible experience which is equally immersive and unique. From the top billed position to the supporting cast, there's not one weak link in the set of characters, which is loaded with premiere acting talent all the way through. Director Ryan Coogler makes his mark not only on the MCU, but on the film industry with a thematic story, which celebrates culture and delivers a down right fun and entertaining superhero flick to boot. With Black Panther, Marvel Studios continues to prove that the MCU is like a fine wine whose films only are getting better with age, and this adventure to Wakanda will stand the test of time as not only a spectacular superhero film, but as a legitimate, effective societal statement.<br/><br/>10/10"

It stars Chadwick Boseman (Captain America: Civil War) as the titular Black Panther, Michael B. Jordan (Creed) as the villainess Erik Killmonger and Academy Award Winner Lupita Nyong'o (12 Years a Slave) as Black Panthers love interest Nakia.<br/><br/>This film is outstanding to look at, the visual effects for the film are great expecially the backgrounds of Wakanda. the direction is fantastic aswell, with director Ryan Coogler using long takes and gorgeous landscape shots. The score by Ludwig Goransson (Creed) is fantastic as well. What I love most about Black Panther though is that it is unlike any other marvel movie, focusing on the characters more than action and comedy makes it stand out from other marvel movies. Which makes it more memorable. The cast is great, the stand outs are Martin Freeman (The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey) as Everett K.

"HStroemXC","5","3","12","17 February 2018"," Run-of-the-mill blockbuster entertainment with an added bonus of some topical (yet modest) social and political commentary
","Black Panther is pretty run-of-the-mill Disney/Marvel if you take it at face value. However, with its somewhat Shakespearian plot combined with themes about the dangers of isolationism it brings with it a few takes on the superhero-blockbuster formula that feels fresh and captivating. It's one of those rare Disney/Marvel movies that stands on its own feet instead of being a 2-hour set up for the next project in line.<br/><br/>On top of that Black Panther also takes a couple of well deserved jabs at social injustices as well as both ""old-school"" western imperialism and modern western imperialism. The jabs may be modest and somewhat unsophisticated (which is to be expected when it comes to movies made and released on this scale) but at least they are still there, and that is something I very much appreciate!<br/><br/>Script, pacing, acting, CGI etc. strikes me as above average overall so no complaints there.

"dee.reid","9","9","56","16 February 2018"," ""Black Panther"" - A film fit for a king
","I believe that I was 20 and in college when I first came across the Black Panther, the first black superhero of any historical significance and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby for Marvel Comics in 1966 (and whose creation pre-dates the October 1966 founding of the Black Panther Party), and in the adventure I read about he was searching the world for his future bride - and eventually found her in the Kenyan Ororo Munroe/Storm (of the X-Men). In his travels, he also came across other noteworthy black superheroes including Brother Voodoo, Luke Cage/Power Man, The Falcon, Monica Rambeau/Pulsar and my personal favorite superhero of color, the vampire hunter Blade.<br/><br/>(As most readers of my reviews know, Spider-Man is my all-time favorite superhero.)<br/><br/>This was 12 years ago, I would say, and the Black Panther has come a long way since then.<br/><br/>Ryan Coogler's (""Fruitvale Station,"" ""Creed"") ""Black Panther"" arrives in a 2018 dominated by racial and social debate (and controversy) - not unlike the time that the Black Panther character first debuted at the height of the Civil Rights Movement in the mid-1960s. The Black Panther first appeared in a two-part origin story - ""Fantastic Four #52"" and ""Fantastic Four #53"" (July 1966-August 1966) - and there he single-handedly defeated the Fantastic Four in order to test his skills in preparation for his battle with his arch-nemesis Ulysses Klaw. Black Panther later became one of the Fantastic Four's closest allies, as well as a member of the Avengers.<br/><br/>""Black Panther,"" the film, has many firsts going for it. It would be the first superhero film with a black director (Coogler), the first superhero film with a largely black cast including strong portrayals of black femininity (and featuring white actors in roles usually reserved for minorities), the first superhero film to display an entirely fictional African culture and civilization in a positive non-stereotypical light, and of course it's a superhero film about the first black superhero ever created (and the first black comic book character that was ALSO not a racist stereotype). It achieves many of its objectives, even if every now and then it slips into some of the corniness and silly comedy that I believe has come to define many modern superhero movies since Disney acquired Marvel nearly a decade ago.<br/><br/>""Black Panther"" is in some respects quite different from most big-budgeted superhero epics of late. The film has a decidedly political slant to it, which I see that some viewers have already commented negatively about. This doesn't give me some of the pause that it should have, and, after viewing the film for myself, I saw that these politics aim to address a key issue that I've often wondered myself about the Black Panther, and his home country - the fictional African nation of Wakanda, which is the most technologically advanced civilization on Earth.<br/><br/>The Black Panther is, of course, the King of Wakanda, and his real name is T'Challa (played here by the mesmerizing Chadwick Boseman). In ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016), that was where the Black Panther was first introduced into the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and in his first outing his father, the previous Black Panther and king of Wakanda, was killed in a terrorist bombing. Now as the new king of Wakanda, T'Challa finds himself tasked with the enormous burden of being leader to his country and his people, who have remained socially isolated from the rest of the world and become the most technologically advanced country not just on the African continent, but possibly the whole world.<br/><br/>Wakanda has managed to thrive, and survive, hundreds of years without having to face the horrors of colonization and exploitation by outside forces, by those who want what has led to Wakanda's vast wealth and technological prowess - the alien metal vibranium. But all this is about to change with the arrival of arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis). But Klaue is merely a puppet in the scheme of Erik Stevens (Coogler regular Michael B. Jordan), a former U.S. military black ops mercenary and hired assassin who now goes by the name ""Killmonger,"" to lay claim to the Wakandan throne. It turns out that Killmonger also has a tragic connection to the Black Panther's past.<br/><br/>I have to say that I was quite well impressed by ""Black Panther."" Some of the early comments I had heard about the film were proven true. The one that stuck out to me the most was the villain Killmonger. Going back to what I said earlier about this film's politics, the character of Killmonger presents an argument about his motivations for villainy that are hard to counter: he forces Wakanda to face up to its greatest moral contradiction, which is its isolationism. His goals are just as much personal as they are political, and this gives him some much-needed dramatic and emotional dimensions to not make him seem like so many bland and poorly defined super-villains of recent memory. That is what I appreciated most in Michael B. Jordan's ruthless, yet ultimately sympathetic, portrayal of such a dangerous and fascinating character.<br/><br/>The film has the usual sensational special effects-driven action scenes that are cool-looking but tend to distract from a film outing that had a lot of firsts going for it, and could have been very different from most other superhero films of the last decade. (Coogler, as the film's co-screenwriter, was at least wise enough to not serve up every other piece of dialogue as a punchline.) The Black Panther, to me, would have worked a lot better if it was a stand-alone picture and not part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but what can I do?<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Black Panther"" did not disappoint. Ryan Coogler had a huge task ahead of him when he made this film and despite a few faults, he delivered. ""Black Panther"" will undoubtedly win the weekend, if not an entirely new generation of young Marvel Comics readers.<br/><br/>9/10"
"holynsker","10","6","33","18 February 2018"," Phenomenal in every aspect.
","This was the first time I'd been excited for a Marvel movie in a long while, and it was absolutely worth the wait, and I think it completely lived up to the hype. Artistically, the film was beautiful and original, with moments like the visits to the ancestral plane, and T'Challa and Killmonger's fall through the vibranium mine taking my breath away. The storyline itself was powerful, and was what really makes me praise it so highly. Killmonger is an extremely well-developed villain, with motives that are understandable. It's easy to find compassion for him, because his pain and anger comes from a very very real place, from an issue that is not foreign to us. The fact that Black Panther introduces so many new characters while giving each one of them deep, nuanced characterization is just one sign of how much care and thought went into its writing. I could go on forever about the things I loved about this movie, but to summarize: go see it, and listen to what it has to say."

A villain with good reasons that have fallen to corruption and anger where he becomes the very thing he's trying to fight against. You are both interested in Killmonger as well as disgusted with him. He makes you hate him, but feel sorry for him and kind of want him to succeed.<br/><br/>The story is intriguing and the lines of good and bad have become blurred. It grabs your attention and holds you tight as it takes you on a ride through family dynamics and the decision to leave Wakanda hiding, or let the world know Wakanda.<br/><br/>I find it hard to explain...So I ask that you see it.

The film is a perfect marriage between great concept and great value.<br/><br/>the background story of the film is more interesting than most of MCU films or story. one of the villain said that Wakanda is the real El Dorado. it is, but the place were kept by people with higher moral value and great understanding of virtue. They were not only deserve to keep the treasure and knowledge from the land, but also protect it from bad people. they were not drowned in it but maintaining it. their leader is the main character, the Black Panther.<br/><br/>the film has two villain. the first one is a colonial type that seek power and fortune for himself. and the second one is more complex than the first one. he's a very angry person, and for reasons, has the right to be. his actions was very logic and has a great purpose. but what is a great purpose if you have a better one. that's the Wakanda people's code of ethic. peace. the value of philosopher. no wonder that they got to rule that El Dorado.<br/><br/>there are several MCU films that i liked, the others i disliked, and Three that i loved. they are:
<ul><li>Iron Man. great plot and a superb character</li><li>Captain America: Civil War, Epic sequences and a great story, also a beautiful tragedy</li><li>Black Panther: great concept and great moral value</li></ul>and i'm hoping there will be others to follow"
"rubysgems","9","4","19","19 February 2018"," Worth the watch!
","I saw Black Panther during its opening weekend, and I really feel it was worth all the hype. It felt less like a super hero movie and more like a drama with story aplenty. It immerses you from the beginning, plunging you in to life for these characters in Wakanda, and makes you want to root for them from the opening scenes. Chadwick Boseman is excellent as both man about to become king and super hero Black Panther. The supporting cast are incredible and the special effects are awe inspiring. I would have to rate this as my second favorite in the whole Marvel Universe, after the first Guardians of the Galaxy-which tops my list mostly due to the extremely fun to watch cast. Definitely a must see!"
"sefrafer","9","4","19","19 February 2018"," Black panther protector of a good movie
","Black panther is the demonstration that if Marvel wants to deliver frames without so much humor it can do it, undoubtedly one of the best movies of super heroes, by not trying to be a film of origin and not being the prelude to Infinity war that is, he found a perfect balance as an individual film and connected to his cinematographic universe his director Ryan Coogler is noted that he knows how to make great stories and that let him tell it his way is to applaud, the cast is great from Chadwick Boseman as the black panther, Michael B Jordan as a truly intimidating antagonist, Lupita Nyong'o great actress, even the little or much that Andy Serkis plays is appreciated, the score by Ludwig GÃ¶ransson is impressive since it is rare to see that they dedicate more to the soundtrack than songs that is to admire and applaud (I appreciate that it was not pure rap, not because I do not like it but it is a very common cliche) and the picture of Rachel Morrison is truly spectacular, the only thing I could say that it is the CGI that there are certain sequences that are not as solid as the plot base, in conclusion it is a solid and entertaining film that shows that well-balanced humor with action and an interesting plot can make a big difference, this movie feels like 2 tapes, on the one hand the heroic and full of action and on the other hand the serious and political issues within your world"

"jackbmeyer","8","4","19","18 February 2018"," Best of Marvel, A Balance of Action and Statement
","Black panther is a good blockbuster pushed to greatness by its importance as a cultural milestone. As far as the recent movies from marvel go, Black Panther is a stand out in how it goes beyond entertainment to dig deeper than most superhero blockbusters. The political statements of a film based in African culture and heritage are main themes and are addressed but manage not to be heavy handed. It can't be ignored, the cultural importance of a movie rooted so deeply in African American culture with important figures of that community coming from all different mediums to create this movie. While its easy for the film to become wrapped up in the statements that it makes within the context of our society, it also functions as one of the better products of marvels fail proof formula. As all marvel films, the characters are a strength, each is compelling and the villains are especially well done, a feat that marvel has struggled with in the past. The action sequences are creative and through all of the quips and jokes there are some genuine heartfelt moments. In the end Black Panther is an enjoyable movie elevated by what it means in a broader context."

"oazam","7","4","19","16 February 2018"," Generic writing but still a perfect film especially for Marvel.
","Marvel has been on a streak of good superhero and I'm pretty sure they managed to outdo their work compared to DC Comics. Seeing Black Panther in Captain America Civil War was amazing and I was looking forward to seeing him in an actual film.<br/><br/>So this takes place right after Captain America Civil War when T'Challa returns back to this nation Wakanda after his father dies in an attack. While there, he decides to take his throne and rule Wakanda until suddenly a powerful enemy N'Jakada invades the nation and has intentions of destroying Wakanda. How T'Challa defeats N'Jakanda and protects the nation of Waanda is basically what this film is all about.<br/><br/>Creed fame Ryan Coogler introduces a superhero film also ""the first black superhero"" of marvel (not racist but praising Marvel for their generosity of how much respect they're showing towards human race). His script was abit of a dissapointment because the movie had a very predictable story and eventually after 45 minutes of the film, the audience will for sure find out what will happen to N'Jakanda. The pacing was a bit slow but that still doesn't shy away for mbeing a perfect.<br/><br/>Luckily there things that were integral to Black Panther such as showing a science fictional version of Africa to traditional clothing. The VFX was fantastic and that is all hats off to MS (Marvel Studios). The look of Busan and Wakanda was just commendable and delightful to watch on the big screen. The action was well choreographed and seeing Marvel with their remarkable efforts doesn't lack justice.<br/><br/>Acting was a phenomenon. Chad Boswick playing T'Challa/Black Panther will just knock your socks off. He was exhilirating and edgy which proves how he is superhero material. Michael B Jordan was the major highlight of the film and his villainous attempt as N'Jakande shows a perfect match of subtlety. Lupita Noyong'o and seeing her as the African spy was defintiely worth devouring espcially how she manages to come clean with ther accent.<br/><br/>Overall, this film may not be perfect because of the average writing but the entertainment of it is something the audience should go and experience. <br/><br/>3.75/5 - Atleast it is a perfect film for the audience."

"burksdon","10","5","26","16 February 2018"," VERY good standslone film!!
","Just saw Marvels Black Panther and I thought it was AWESOME! I thought it was a fantastic look at some very much needed character development, in which Marvel movies tend to not do very well. <br/><br/>PROS: GREAT Story. The narrative was easy to follow along, and kept you in the thicke of things. I never got lost. It was also very engaging.<br/><br/>PROS: THE WORLD BUILDING. You get to see Wakanda and the city. Way better world building than Thor. You actually felt like your there in Wakanda.<br/><br/>PROS: The visuals. Oh man, the visuals were breathtaking.<br/><br/>PROS: The Direction. Ryan Cooglar put together a super hero film that felt like a indie drama that happens to have a super hero in it.<br/><br/>PROS: The acting. Everyone gets to shine. And all the performances were great. Leticia Wright stole every scene. A few scenes will make you cry. There was so much emotion in this film.<br/><br/>PROS: The Villain. Michael B Jordan is great in this, and Marvel finally gave us a great villain. You start understanding where he is coming from, and you actually start feeling for him.<br/><br/>PROS: Not a comedy. Hated that Thor Ragnarock was basically a comedy. Marvel films always have tons of jokes in it. Not this one. The jokes here come natural, and not forced.<br/><br/>PROS: NOT political. I was told this movie was political. It was from a standpoint of people trying to take the throne, but not political, in a us political. It did feel like Game of Thrones in some areas.<br/><br/>CONS: CGI. The final fight was too cgi heavy. It didn't ta me me out of the movie, but it was too cartoonie. <br/><br/>CONS: Not enough fighting without the suit from T'Challa. And they downplayed his genius.<br/><br/>All in all, I give it a 10/10 and in my opinion, BEST standalone film by Marvel."
"pdmajumder","9","6","34","18 February 2018"," An ethnic, rooted superhero film
","For a character, whom, even just a couple of years ago, people had known nothing about, Black Panther created quite an appreciable amount of hype and expectation and lived up to it all. Marvel's latest release packs a lot of exhilarating action with imaginative and vibrant visuals and a detailed plot. It is the story of an African prince from the fictitious nation of Wakanda, thrown in the face of kingship after the sudden death of his father, having to deal with his new found responsibilities, rivals and an unexpected enemy with a connection to his own past. <br/><br/>This movie may not be exactly an origin story as it is not the first time we see this character but it checks all the boxes for qualifying as one and from the string of all of the recent ones we've seen, this may as well be the best. Breaking away from formulaic Marvel (which I love too) Black Panther immerses itself in the climate of a foreign land and stays true to the heart and culture of Africa. Every part of the film is very well thought out in terms of visual detail and since the story is of the mythological kind, there is almost a fairytale-like charm we feel, when watching the film walk down very similar lanes. Black Panther's character also gives us throwback vibes of James Bond as he is mostly decked with high tech gadgets and suits with even a car that need not be directly driven by him (Tomorrow Never Dies, anyone?). <br/><br/>Applaudable character development has become second nature to a Marvel production and we see that tradition being continued very diligently here too. Chadwick Boseman obviously dazzles in the titular role and manages to balance the intricacies of his character's delicate nature and strong determination and power skillfully. But everyone around him is equally valuable to the story too and it never feels like the film was being borne on the shoulders of the lead only. In fact, without the rest of his team which includes a lot of fiery women, he would probably have died. There aren't many jaw dropping twists in this film although a significant one occurs at the interval where the story changes course. The movie deals with some very relatable and often contentious political issues too, that the lead deals with as a result of him becoming the king of his country but with the truth of his very own existence being shrouded in secrecy, it gets a lot harder for him to do the right thing. Thus, watching him mature into the leader that his people need is an enjoyable experience. The villain is challenging and tests the limits of the hero's abilities which is what shows us how human the latter really is and how sometimes, that and loyalty is enough to overcome any obstacle.<br/><br/>On the whole Black Panther is a layered film with diverse aspects just like the soul and culture of the place it is set in. It will leave you with the excitement of Infinity War, too, as the mid-credits and post-credits scenes set up, to some extent, the prologue of the upcoming climactic extravaganza."

","As a White person I was apprehensive going into this film, as I'd heard rumors it would contain some anti-White sentiment. <br/><br/>But I was pleasantly surprised to find the film mostly just contains positive and empowering messages of Ethnic Solidarity and National Pride for Black people.<br/><br/>The fictional African nation of Wakanda is a racially homogeneous ethno-state, yet its people also still feel solidarity with their fellow Africans throughout the continent. A key part of the plot is the question of will the Wakandans keep their advanced technology for themselves, or will they share it will their fellow Africans, while still retaining their national sovereignty and identity. <br/><br/>This, I believe, is a wonderful message that I as a White person could relate to. Its not anti-White, just pro-Black.<br/><br/>Malcolm X would have loved this film."

"hilljennifer67","10","2","7","4 December 2019"," One of the best MCU movies I seen
","Black Panther has been getting a lot of flack from the trolls since the first trailer popped on social media in the summer of 2017. Than a couple of months before the movie is released, people were saying it will flop, the trolls was purposely giving the movie 1 out of 10 ratings on here and on rotten tomatoes BEFORE they even seen the movie and even went as far as creating an Anti Black Panther movie page on Facebook which is no longer existing thanks to me and other people reported it<br/><br/>Fast forward to February 2018, the movie went to gross a billion at the box office and win plenty of awards and became a cultural phenomenon. Well the haters are still seething to this day lol ðŸ˜‚ But anyway, I loved everything about this movie. The characters, the visuals, the cinematography and the score. I was entertained through the whole movie, the only thing that I didn't like was the terrible CGI during the final battle, and I do wish T'Challa wasn't treated as a secondary character in his own movie.<br/><br/>I understand that new characters associated with BP will be introduced but I'm sure MCU fans get what I mean. And I maybe alone on this, but I don't think T'Challa was ""boring"" in this film compared to Civil War. I said what I said. Obviously the man returned to his country, his father's death avenged so he can live peaceful with friends and family, enjoy life, smile and not be an tyrant. And fans were saying he got beat by Killmonger which didn't make sense. Well actually it did, because if the fans would have read the BP comics, which obviously half of the fans didn't. Killmonger beat T'Challa and threw him off the cliff in the comics too! So Coogler basically took that part in the movie literally from the comics<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is one of my favorite MCU movies next to Civil War, and Endgame. Can't wait for BP 2 in 2022"

"jakebirkel","10","2","7","17 March 2019"," Full characters, a vibrant world, and an engrossing tale.
","Black Panther is one of those movies that, years from now, everyone will look back at and ask ""how did this not win all the awards?"" It's intricate, filled with such a world, and remains entertaining all the same.<br/><br/>Writing/Direction: Ryan Coogler, man. Yes. The dude really knows how to make a movie. From his directional touch that really pulls us into the world of Wakanda to the writing that creates such vivid characters that really go to their full potential, Ryan Coogler has created a masterpiece not only as a superhero movie, but as a general film.<br/><br/>Performances: Chadwick Boseman IS T'challa and is practically perfect in his casting. He's great, no denying it. The thing that intrigued me, however, is how he seemed a bit outplayed by his supporting ensemble. No offense to Chadwick, but there's a lot more at play than the lead in this film and I really appreciate that. The women of Wakanda are especially badass. Lupita, Danai, and Letita shine as Nakia, Okoye, and Shuri respectively. They're fantastic female characters who have fantastic performers behind them. I could say some stuff about Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis, who both give off appealing enough performances, Angela Basset, who practically plays herself (very well I might add), the formidable and capable Winston Duke, and Daniel Kalluya, who continues to hold his own. However, I firmly believe none of them hold a candle to Michael B. Jordan's performance as the central villain, Erik Killmonger. He gains our sympathy throughout the film while still being a fairly intimidating villain with complex motives and reasoning that makes the viewer (and T'challa) think. He gives a performance that puts him at the top of the Marvel villain list (not quite at the top of all CBM villains, I mean, Heath Ledger amiright?).<br/><br/>I still insist on praising just about every aspect of this film. Tell me you haven't listened to Ludwig Goranssen's killer soundtrack and it hasn't gotten stuck in your head. Tell me you weren't mesmerized by the production design that made Wakanda so palatable. Tell me you weren't impressed by the beautiful costumes, well-choreographed fights, and awesome cinematography that was shown throughout. (The only thing that holds merit is some CGI issues, but even then, consider their challenge and look at the beautiful establishing shots of Wakanda and tell me that's not some beautifully rendered CGI.)<br/><br/>Black Panther is a fully realized world with vibrant characters and an engrossing tale and serves as a new standard for filmmaking. (10/10)"

I thought acting was good for the genre it was in (again, what kind of Shakespearean depth can you expect in an action movie? What are you comparing it with, Iron Man? Please.). I absolutely loved the visuals, the costumes were great. The idea of having a magical yet also cultural narrative to a superhero film makes it that much more like an actual movie. The female warriors and the general male-female dynamic is quite a statement in itself for a movie in this genre as well. I guess those who hate on the film are not able to appreciate these aspects. It's sad to see so many people calling this (and those who reviewed it positively) political. But we live in a post-factual hyper-reality so I guess it's the new norm, unfortunately."

"michaeledward1212","8","2","7","2 April 2018"," Everything A Superhero Origin Story Should Be + More
","I'm a bit puzzled at the negative reviews floating to the top, but I'm guessing the superhero movie fatigue and racist tendencies of reviewers has something to do with it. Black Panther is everything you could want from a Superhero origin story, and sometimes more. <br/><br/>Black Panther forgoes the typical superhero origin format, and we begin with T'Challa primed and ready for the throne, which is refreshing because we don't have to see scene after scene of a superhero beginning to understand their powers and slowly coming into themselves, we get to cut to the best parts of his story, and essentially get into the action rather quickly. <br/><br/>Although some of the characters are a bit underdeveloped, namely W'Kabi who is unbelievable as T'Challa's lifelong friend and lover of Okoye, because we see so little of him, most of the characters are multidimensional and more fully realized than I've come to expect in MCU films. The first act of the movie sets up Andy Serkis as the main villain, but he's quickly dispatched of midway through the movie to make way for the more interesting Kilmonger. Kilmonger does have a cliche childhood trauma backstory, but is still leagues above the average action movie villain, which often ends up being a CGI monster or last minute obstacle for the protagonist to kill. The morality is surprisingly nuanced, and I found myself siding with Kilmonger for parts of the movie, and actually questioning the heroes motivations and methods, which makes for much more interesting storytelling. <br/><br/>The female characters actually get a chance to shine, and are just as compote to and important to the story as T'Challa. Okoye was the main standout, the leader of a group of generals who serve the throne of Wakanda, Okoye gets to have amazing action sequences and I would've almost liked to have her be the one to defeat Kilmonger as opposed to T'Challa, but I understand why from a storytelling perspective they went with a more conventional ending. <br/><br/>Nakia, is the love interest of T'Challa and actually sides with Kilmonger in some ways, and actually changes T'Challa's opinion by the end of the movie. Unlike most heterosexual romances in these kinds of films, I didn't find the relationship forced or gratuitous, and I liked that it was more of a small part of the story, and their friendship was the focus for the most part, as well as their ideological differences.<br/><br/>Shuri is another very well developed character, and is the Black Panther's younger sister who masterminded much of Wakanda's technology and the Black Panther suit itself. Shuri was not only extremely smart, but a great comic relief at times, although I felt her interactions with Martin Freeman's character got tired eventually, because it seemed like he was tacked on purely for exposition purposes and to give white people someone to relate to. <br/><br/>All in all I I thought Black Panther had great, if not overtly CGI action, and the costume and general set design was amazing, and probably the standout aspect for me. The aesthetic perfectly married futuristic sci-fi with tribal design, as well as an Art Deco sensibility reflected in the poster. Black Panther is one of the best superhero movies in recent years, another hit for Marvel with a touching message about not cutting yourself off from the rest of the world and sharing resources to boot."

"FilmCriticChick88","10","2","7","19 March 2018"," Captivating, Visually Stunning and Relatable
","I've seen this movie twice. The first time around I thought the movie was good, but not as good as what everybody claimed it to be. I think my opinion at that moment was due to the fact that I had walked into the movie late and missed the opening scenes. The second time around, however, I got to see the opening to the storyline which drew me in. There were moments in the movie that had went over my head the first time that I watched it, that I finally understood on the second trip.<br/><br/>I liked the vibrant colors in this movie. The outfits and the design of the characters were really impressive. I liked how they modernized tribal-looking things and blended it with technology. One scene that really stood out to me was when T'Challa was walking out of the spacecraft onto the top of the waterfall to be celebrated by the Wakandans' singing. Then the camera pans upward to show all of the people welcoming him home. I was impressed by M'baku coming out of the cave inside the waterfall and I thought his mask looked really cool. That opening fight scene really drew me in. Chadwick Boseman is a very good actor, as well as Michael B. Jordan, and Winston Duke. I think the whole cast including Lupita N'yongo, Angela Bassett and Letitia Wright were perfect for the movie and very convincing. <br/><br/>If I had to choose a favorite scene, it would be the scene where Killmonger and T'Challa were fighting while still falling. It was like Killmonger was so determined to destroy T'challa that he didn't pay attention to the height that he was falling. Killmonger had so much anger built up in him and he did EVERYTHING (""I waited my entire life for this"") just to be able to take T'Challa down. Although, Killmonger was RUTHLESS and a cold-blooded killer he was very relatable. How many of us have been the underdog, been done wrong or have had almost everything taken from us? I think many African-American's can really relate to that because of the past mistreatment that their ancestors have faced and some still face today. I think it's not only relatable to African-American's but to any race in everyday situations. How many of us can also say that we have not desired retribution, or just wanting to get back on top? I think that's something a lot can relate to. <br/><br/>My criticisms of this film would be that they should have kept Killmonger alive and just made him join forces with the Wakandan's. I think Michael B. Jordan was so convincing and I think if they really want the next Black Panther to be good they should keep his character. Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan were the main characters that kept the audience glued to the screen. My advice to Ryan Coogler is to keep Killmonger in. By the way Ryan Coogler is an awesome director. Oh, and another critique before I go is that, they should have did more with the soundtrack. I mean go really hard with the music and blend even more of the African, tribal sounds with the hard trap beats. Overall good movie!"

","I find it strange that people believe the plot is complicated. If you aren't a total idiot, you can understand the nature of this film. While it does remind me of the Lion King, and while I wish there had been more scenes of Black Panther using his super abilities and in his actual attire, overall the movie's direction was smart. It wasn't just a super hero movie. Social and cultural themes were woven into it, giving Black Panther a more developed character. The visuals were stunning and ALL of the supporting characters were developed. It was more than just a Marvel movie. It was just a movie all its own.<br/><br/>I don't understand why there can't be superhero movies that are a little serious just like this. Many people constantly talk about how the other movies were funny. But let's think about the original comics. They weren't all riddled with corny jokes. There were some funny scenes and such, but why can't super hero movies cause controversy as well? If this had been a story about other controversies, relative to other races of people, no one would feel this movie was ""unrelatable"". Captain America Winter Soldier had a deeper story line than some of the others, and was more thought-provoking than other Marvel movies. This movie gives a similar flavor. Still, does a movie need humor to be good? I don't think so. Still, if that's what you're looking for, the seriousness of the theme can cloud out the humor at many points of the story.<br/><br/>Yet, I would like to move beyond the backstory in the future and actually see the super hero in his essence, in his suit, saving others' lives.

","First of all, the colors in this movie were gorgeous. The various sunset scenes or the scenes on the ancestral plane just felt so alive and so beautiful. I guess I'm too used to the old washed out ""realistic"" palette most films favor now where real is shades of brown and grey but Black Panther was just a feast for my eyes with the brilliant colors blasted across the screen. This ties into the fact the outfits were lovely and pretty much like nothing that's seen on the silver screen too much. The whole Pan African inspiration slash futuristic technopunk vibe, I really enjoyed it. I only thought one piece looked back and that was Okoye's (Danai Gurira) wig in the casino scene but given she throws it at an attacking goon I'm sure the bad wig was intentionally. And of course the Panther suit looked really good especially with the lights they gave it to signal how charged it was with kinetic energy, I'm glad they chose purple for T'Challa and gold for Killmonger's suit as those are both royal colors which makes sense for the characters but also breaks they old cliche of Good Guy in Blue and Bad Guy in Red.<br/><br/>The set pieces and scenery(both real and computer generated) were very gorgeous. I liked the big rocks that looked like panthers and gorillas, it brought an epic feeling to the movie something like the Pillars of Kings did for the LOTR movies. Shuri's lab looked very clean, bright, and sparkly which I thought fit the character's personality very well so I'm sure that was an intentional choice and a good one.<br/><br/>I loved almost every single character in the movie and became quite invested in their storylines. I thought certain characters fell a little flat(Everett Ross doesn't really have much going for him other than he's a US government agent and W'Kabi wasn't very interesting) but I think that might have been a time issue where their roles were cut down to keep the movie from running overly long and the characters still worked well in the story so I can't complain.<br/><br/>I did not expect to laugh as much as I did in the theater, there were some parts where the whole audience cracked up and we were all roaring together. That was great, Marvel's been real good at snappy one-liners and quick jokes and this movie definitely keeps that alive. Klaue and Shuri were the ones with most of the laughs but both had a lot more going on than just being comic relief so it never became grating.<br/><br/>Killmonger is, hands down, the best Marvel villain so far. He's got a complex mix of personal motivation and ideological motivation which makes him a heck of a lot more interesting than the old and tired ""money, dear boy"" or ""i just want to rule the world because reasons"" motivations you typically find for superhero movie villains. Michael B Jordan I thought played him fantastically, his performance was extremely charismatic, I'm just sorry to see the character leave so soon. To me it didn't make sense to have T'Challa repeat the same mistakes as T'Chaka did by killing his blood but this is somewhat mitigated by the fact T'Challa is shown to actually be making changes to solve the problems that allowed the villain to become who he was in the first place. I still wish they had kept Killmonger on though instead of killing him, that's the most fun I've had watching a Marvel villain since Loki.<br/><br/>The romance of the fill was very smooth, it did not disrupt the plot or hog screen time. Such a breath of fresh air! Though hopefully it will be explored more in Black Panther sequels. You can tell there's much more to it than what was shown and I'd like to see T'Challa and Nakia together as opposed to the separate exes-in-love-still thing they had going in this movie.<br/><br/>This movie also proposes some heavy questions. Is it right for an advanced nation to be isolationist while disadvantaged people suffer around the world? Is violence the only means free a class from oppression or can it be done peacefully? What is the cost of the lost identity many black Americans have with their ancestral homeland of Africa and how heavy do the chains of slavery still weigh on the black men of the US? The movie also speaks strongly in condemnation of colonization and the looting of the natural resources of Africa by foreign powers. It's a thinker as well as your good old smash-bang-flip superhero movie. It ends hopefully, it doesn't leave you feeling down despite the heaviness of the questions it raises and that makes it worth so much more to me. We all need hope. We all need to believe the future will be a brighter place than the present. We all want to believe in heroes. <br/><br/>I think it's crazy this movie is only resting at a 7.9 at the time of this review. I think a lot of the negativity is probably bitterness that this movie continues to outperform standard fare at the box office and people are hating it because it's been so popular to praise. And there's definitely some spoil sports trying to sink a black-directed and majority black cast movie, unfortunately that's the world we live in. Insert the Kanye shrug here, some people are just determined not to have a great time.<br/><br/>I can't find a single solid thing to complain about here in this movie hence my 10. I eagerly await the sequels to this."

"Horst_In_Translation","6","2","7","20 February 2018"," The new hero in town, yep another
","""Black Panther"" is a new American movie that makes it quite comfortably past the 2-hour mark and here we have the most recent addition to the Marvel universe as in the face of the topic of racism that is still oh so dominant (really more than it should be as we are living in very tolerant times) we get the first Black superhero movie in a long time. Ryan Coogler directs and he is also part of the writing squad. I would say that by including a main antagonist here that is also Black they took some racial tension out here, but if you look at the political history of America and the Black Panthers, it may not be the wisest move to go with this animal. Besides, I felt there was far from sufficient elaboration why they did. The dream sequence with the father being a panther now that he is dead alone wasn't enough for sure. Another slightly controversial decision that the main antagonist is an American megalomaniac was not the most sensitive either. But luckily, there are also enough positive things to mention here. Technically, the film is on a pretty high level in terms of sound and visual effects, there is no reason to say it isn't on par with other Marvel stuff from recent history. Also the film shows that you don't need characters from previous Marvel films to succeed the way they included Hulk most recently in Thor 3. And Boseman in the lead does a pretty good job like everybody else almost, certainly better than Cumberbatch for example. The one exception here is Kaluuya whose character did almost nothing for me and whose performance rang pretty false too on several occasions. The one who made up for that was Andy Serkis, who was great fun to watch and perhaps the best thing about the movie, one of not too many white performers here, who were mostly included for comedic (not entirely) situations. This description also fits Martin Freeman's role and he was the same as usual sadly, but luckily his material was good without being too challenging, so it worked. Not the Freeman you'd expect in this film though, is he?<br/><br/>From the Black cast, a special mention goes out to Winston Duke who was really hilarious and makes the most of the little (screen time) he was given here. His cannibalism/vegetarianism joke was perhaps the best (recurring) joke the entire film had to offer. Michael B. Jordan was a good main antagonist I think, even if he seemed a bit insignificant early on, but that's okay. He sure is no Andy Serkis. The film's weakest moment was the epilogue that we got here the way we got it in every Marvel movie where we have the King tell the press that his country will no longer ignore global conflicts and this went entirely against everything before that as one of the key messages here was that they do not want to be involved while the bad guy wants to use the country's ressources to dominate the world. It was simply wrong. Obviously this was done so that they could include Black Panther in other upcoming Marvel films like the next Avengers movie, but probably others as well. Very cheap and if that's one of the things you remember the most when leaving the theater, then that is almost a negative deal-breaker. But luckily most of what we saw earlier was good enough, especially the shots at comedy that never felt as wrong or try-hard as in an Iron Man film (sorry RDJ), for me to still recommend the watch here. There are nonetheless serious issues here like the way the protagonist recovers so unrealistically quickly after his defeat and honestly this really felt like taken from Batman's conflict with Bane and he cannot defeat the bad guy at the peak of his physical fitness before that, but then he wins afterward after being in a coma recently? Nah guys. The female amazon tribe story added nothing for me either. So overall, realism, authenticity and convincing character elaborations are an issue here and the final scene in America about that apartment felt really try-hard in making a political impact and the film is never as touching or politically relevant from the contemporary perspective as it wants to be, but it is like other recent Marvel films okay from the pointless fun perspective. I give it a thumbs-up. Worth checking out, but not a must-see by any means."
"Carycomic","9","2","7","17 February 2018"," Excellent lead-in to AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR.
","The story is straightforward enough. The prologue is set in 1992, where a much younger King T'Chaka visits one of his War Dogs (Wakandans who are supposed to impartially spy on the Outside World) who turns out to be his younger brother Prince N'Jobu! Charges of treason are leveled against the prince, following which...<br/><br/>...the movie fast-forwards 24 years.<br/><br/>That's right. The bulk of the movie is set one week after the ending of CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR. And the bulk of the script has been brilliantly adapted from the debut story arc in Marvel Comics' ""Jungle Action."" A magazine of the 1970's that helped revive reader interest in Prince T'Challa after his departure from the Silver Age comic book Avengers, ten years earlier. And which first introduced then-teenagers like me to such memorable characters as Erik Killmonger; M'Baku the Man-Ape; and Monica Lynn.<br/><br/>Sadly, the latter has been replaced by another, more geographically convenient love interest; the Lady Nakia. But, the other two are still around and refreshingly updated for the 2010's. M'Baku, in particular! In the comics, his tribe/clan worshipped white gorillas (as part of a cult outlawed by the more dominant Panther Clan). Yet, in this movie, they worship a West African avatar of Hanuman (the Hindu monkey god).*<br/><br/> While Erik Killmonger goes from being a common mercenary to someone with an initially mysterious grudge against T'Challa. Hence, the former's eventual double-cross of Ulysses Klaw (who, btw, goes from East European mad scientist-changed-into-creature-of-living sound, in the comic books, to expatriate South African cyborg in the film).*<br/><br/> I don't want to give away too much of the rest of the story. Suffice it to say that Chadwick Boseman gave just as convincing a performance as T'Challa as he did in CA:CW. Thereby making the two hour-and-then-some running time fly by relatively fast. Including the now-customary sneaky epilogues during the ending credits!<br/><br/> One strange thing, though. Based on all the advance person-on-the-street interviews I saw on the six o'clock news, this movie was hailed as a revolutionary (and long overdue) first step in bringing an African-American superhero to the silver screen. So, why was most of the audience who went to see this at my hometown multiplex...of the Caucasian persuasion?<br/><br/>Ah, well!*<br/><br/>*Don't ask. Just enjoy."

The reason why I did not give Black Panther a 10/10 is because I felt like there was not enough fighting scenes within the film, not only were the fighting scenes very short but there were not enough of these.

","As is the case with the law of averages, the what some would call the law of the inevitable, we just keep waiting for the day in which Marvel makes the wrong move but that day continues to feel like a far off, near impossibility, as the superhero empire (with help from the Mouse House) continue to unleash quality and more risky products like it's no big deal at all.<br/><br/>Continuing on the trend with what could well be their biggest risk from outside the normal yet, Ryan Coogler's Black Panther may not mess with the well-worn superhero narrative formula but thanks to Coogler's pitch-perfect direction, a brilliant cast that all seem committed and a passionate representation of African culture embedded into an otherwise generic set-up, this Marvel event is going to become a quick favourite of many right around the world.<br/><br/>First appearing in this current format in Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther see's Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa/Black Panther become king of secretive African nation Wakanda and fighting the good fight to keep his country's order in place while he tries to stop Andy Serkis's arms dealer Ulysses Klaue from trading into the precious commodity of vibranium and stop Michael B. Jordan's nefarious Killmonger from gaining anymore traction in his quest to make Wakanda his own.<br/><br/>There's really nothing overly special about this story, one that plays out as you would expect it to, but Coogler who showed such talent with his debut Fruitvale Station and his bigger budgeted follow-up Creed instils his film with a true sense of heart and purpose and full-credit to him and Marvel for allowing Black Panther's roots in the African culture to take full effect here.<br/><br/>Thanks to Coogler's guidance, the country of Wakanda and the beautifully realised settings and production design of Black Panther make it Marvel's most visually captivating film yet (sorry Ragnarok) and combined with a selection of Kendrick Lamar's tailored songs, this is Marvel at its most technically and aesthetically proficient.<br/><br/>All this technical prowess and impressive direction would be for naught if Coogler and his ensemble failed to meet but as his proved with his previous films, Coogler once again shows himself a filmmaker well in-tuned to his actors.<br/><br/>Led by the impressive Boseman, Black Panther's much-publicised predominately African-American cast all work together to create Marvel's best team-up outside of the Avengers and Guardians and the Galaxy, with a highlight coming in the form of Michael B. Jordan's key-bad Killmonger.<br/><br/>Killmonger (real name Erik Stevens) is Marvel's most impressive villain outside of Loki, with Jordan doing a fantastic job at bringing this tormented and in some ways justified character to life and whenever his on screen, Black Panther elevates itself to greater heights.<br/><br/>Killmonger's anger and resentment to what has happened to him and his people is more powerful than your average superhero alien looking to take over Earth for no real-reason and with this, Coogler's film has some powerful things to say about the world in which we live, not often the case with a comic-book adaptation.<br/><br/>It's actually the films biggest downfall in many ways that it doesn't utilise Jordan more in its 2 hour plus runtime and had it managed to squeeze more of Jordan's escapades into its sometimes more slowly paced and methodical opening half, Black Panther could've become something undeniable and memorably special.<br/><br/>Final Say - <br/><br/>Re-writing the rulebook with its casting and socially relevant themes, Black Panther may not reinvent the superhero staple but it's a fresh and often exciting new addition to the Marvel universe that's deserving of its likely box-office dominance, making Black Panther a king well-deserving of its spot on the throne.<br/><br/>4 armoured rhino's out of 5"

"leegato","8","8","51","16 February 2018"," The Bridge Between A Ryan Coogler Drama and a Fantasy Superhero Film
","I came into the theater with high expectations for Black Panther, given it was directed by one of my favorite young and rising directors, Ryan Coogler. Coogler, who previously directed Fruitvale Station and Creed, has proven to be an excellent director for portraying drama and character studies in contemporary settings. With Black Panther, though I had high expectations, I also didn't know what to expect; was Coogler going to do a drama or was he going to stray from his style to fit Marvel Studios' aesthetic?<br/><br/>The answer is both, and the result is a unique film that at times feels like a Coogler film and, at other times, feels like a Marvel Studios fantasy.<br/><br/>I overall enjoyed Black Panther; it fell short on some aspects in terms of being both a superhero film and a sociopolitical drama, but still manages to hit all the marks.<br/><br/>The characters are well-written and lovable, simple as that. A superhero film is only as good as its villain, and Michael B. Jordan's portrayal of Killmonger is sure to be in the books as one of the stronger Marvel villains in the MCU. The film invests its story into fleshing out the emotional drama and perspective that Killmonger uses to justify his antagonistic actions; for the first time in a long time in the MCU, we sympathize with the ""villain,"" and his viewpoints touches on the social commentary in which the film finds its strengths. Letitia Wright as Shuri also stole the show, both serving as tasteful comedy relief and as a strong supporting character to Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa.<br/><br/>The social commentary of this film, which is what I was most looking forward to, is excellent. It's not very explicit and takes some thinking to dissect, and frankly I could spend hours analyzing the metaphors this film produces that connect the fantastic themes present in Wakanda to our real-world issues of marginalization and how the world perceives Third World Countries. Instead, I will say that the social commentary is used as a means to advance the film's plot and retain the central themes; it's like any good Marvel movie that poses a moral question (Winter Soldier, Civil War), only this time it feels more contemporary and more relevant than ever. The themes touch on the power of countries and what responsibility they bear to the world, and particularly focuses on the marginalization and historical oppression of African Americans and poses the question on what can be done to resolve this continuous issue in our society. It's very compelling and is a story that must be told, making Black Panther an excellent addition to Ryan Coogler's dramatic filmography.<br/><br/>That said, this film does try to balance between being a dramatic social discussion and a fantastic superhero film, and ultimately that becomes the reason why this film fell flat on certain moments. The action is derivative, CGI-laden, and boring, and this was disappointing given that Creed had simply phenomenal fight sequences and choreography. I will say that the action in Black Panther has the same emotional background and payoff that the fighting in Creed had, but Coogler is still trying to find his footing on how to direct a superhero action sequence, and I think he tried a bit too hard on appealing to comic book fans on this one when it came to the action (too many cutaways, not enough careful focus or emphasis on skilled combat, etc.). There were definitely some action moments I loved (at one point we had a one-shot moment again a la Creed), but there wasn't enough. The film is also grounded in fantasy; few scenes take place in contemporary cities, which I was hoping for more of, but, ultimately, that's personal preference. Wakanda's scenes feel somewhat like the scenes of Asgard in the Thor franchise, so the fantasy aspects can be a bit tiring. To each their own.<br/><br/>Overall, Black Panther is definitely the best Marvel film in a while (since, arguably, Captain America: The Winter Soldier) but is certainly not the best. Although riddled with superhero cliches and dialogue, Black Panther's compelling social commentary, strong characters, and an all-around excellent cast make it an excellent addition to both Coogler's filmography as well as the MCU."
"bowmanblue","8","6","35","15 February 2018"," Welcome to the shared universe, Your Highness
","'Black Panther' has received a lot of hype surround it being the first superhero film with a black leading man (even though that mantel probably should have gone to 1997's 'Spawn,' but it is correct at least in terms of the current Marvel Shared Universe). However, I really don't believe its success will have much to do with anything so shallow. In short: it's a modern day Marvel film and, if you're a regular at the multiplexes, you'll probably already know what to expect: a hero with superpowers taking on - basically - an evil version of themselves. So, if that's what you're into (and current Box Office trends says that many of us are!) then you're going to enjoy this just as much as 'Iron Man, Thor' and all the others. The reason: it's just a cool, colourful, charismatic film which is great to eat popcorn to.<br/><br/>It's set just after 'Captain America: Civil War,' but perhaps one of the first things I should mention is that you don't really need to have seen any other films in the MCU to fully understand everything that happens here. We meet up with King T'Challa of (fictional African nation) Wakanda who, along with ruling his nation since the recent death of his father, also moonlights as the super-powered 'Black Panther,' who, as yet, has kept his and his country's 'special' abilities a secret from the rest of the world. Now, faced with exposure of just what Wakanda is capable of, he is faced with whether to continue its current way of existing, or enter the fray (which will no doubt take him further into the path of the Avengers and their exploits).<br/><br/>So, there's nothing new in terms of plot, but it's definitely a distant cousin of the recent Marvel movie 'Thor: Ragnarok' in terms of its look and feel. It's very colouring to look at (nothing DC-like by being all 'dark and gritty' here!) - you may even say its looks like a 'living comic book!). It's a great-looking film visually, but, if you're being overly-critical, you could say that there's a little too much CGI, especially in the backdrops. I know this is a criticism levelled at all 'fantastical' films where whole new planets/civilisations have to be created, but sometimes you can tell the King is talking to someone up against a greenscreen.<br/><br/>Also, it's worth noting that there isn't - quite - as much humour in this film as other recent Marvel entries. I guess this is down to - sort of - handicapping its leading man by making him a King. Before, we've had leading men who are gods/thieves/playboy billionaires - all of whom are allowed the freedom to let a witty quip roll of their tongues at a moment's notice. However, here, if the Black Panther did that, it would probably feel a little out of character. Luckily, the film makes up for this by surrounding him with a stellar supporting cast who are well-schooled in letting off steam with a one-liner or two.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Black Panther' is just another excellent and enjoyable thrill ride in the Marvel universe. Don't expect anything too deep or revolutionary - just expect a good time and be prepared to bow at not just His Majesty - the King of Wakanda - but also yet another amazingly-successful in a film franchise that never seems to be able to run out of steam."

It is a great script that was brought to life by a phenomenal cast. Chadwick Boseman is a perfect T'Challa and Black Panther. Micheal B Jordan provides a great performance as Erik Killmonger and the character has really good depth and a back story that makes him a convincing Bad Guy, possibly the greatest MCU villain we've seen yet. T'Challa's little sister Shuri steals many of the scenes she is in. Wakanda is beautiful and the movie was beautiful. Black Panther is made up of a predominately African American cast as it should be and provides and rich culture and shows us what an African nation would look like if it wasn't conquered. This is very much a political movie as it is a superhero movie. The fight scenes were mostly great and well choreographed. Some little weaknesses were the CGI wasn't perfect and it was a bit slow at the beginning. There are 2 after credit scenes that are both important.

However, T'Challa is challenged by his cousin Erik Killmonger, who was abandoned in his childhood when his father was killed. <br/><br/>From the director of marvelous films like Creed and Fruitvale Station, Ryan Coogler proves that he is one such fine young talented guy who can transform a script into a must-see film. The first half is fast-paced and makes you glued to the screen with high-voltage drama followed by superbly executed car-chasing scene in Tokyo. We are also introduced to new characters like Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ulysses Klaw (brilliantly played by Andy Serkis). The movie takes a sweet turn and second half becomes little monotonous with fall of King Of Wakhanda. The length of the film takes a backseat while editing could have been better. The saving grace is marked by a good comeback of Black Panther a.k.a King Of Wakhanda with a strong climax scene. As usual, there is a scene once the movie ends and a final scene after the entire credit rolls out. <br/><br/>Visual effects are superb while Cinematography is excellent. Screenplay is very good and should be lauded for keeping us engaged throughout. Ryan Coogler does a good job in defining each character with aplomb. Each actor has done justice their role which makes the movie even better. But I felt, Andy Serkis stood out as Ulysses Klaw. The brilliant actor was mind-blowing in a small role and I wish the makers could have kept his characters alive for some more time.<br/><br/>Overall, Black Panther has the right ingredients to keep you entertained. It turned out to be better than what I was expecting. Excellent 4/5"

","The classic Black Panther story returns, with the new edge in terms of tech and talent (no spoilers). The original storyline leaves substantial room for strong female characters -- and we have the amazing Angela Basset at the helm for this. The entire cast does a really amazing job and the special effects are exceptional. Points off for the execution of the multiple spirit world scenes, which could have been much less ""Lion King,"" especially given the amazing job done in the rest of the film. Despite this, the movie ranks highly for me as a great action-adventure film for the whole family."

","Black Panther, much like Civil War, is not only a fun superhero movie with fantastic action scenes, it's a movie with a message! I won't spoil it, but it has one! Black Panther was a blast from start to finish! The acting was great, especially from Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan! The film has the best villain in an MCU movie since Loki, he has one of the best backstories I've seen in a long time! The story is simple, but it works! Seriously, people always expect a deep and complex story, it's always hard to satisfy people. The action scenes, while can be a bit dark sometimes, are still fantastic and tons of fun to watch! If you're looking for a fun action/superhero movie, Black Panther is definitely for you! It's a must see for Marvel fans! Seriously people, not everything has to be The Dark Knight!"

"jk-12641","8","6","37","14 February 2018"," Great addition to the mcu
","The film was a nice addition to the ever expanding mcu, it opens up new things to look at now in the mcu just like what Thor did, Guardians Of The Galaxy, I like the villain Erik Killmonger I though he was great and at times the film tried to make us feel sorry for him because of his father being killed by the father of T'Challa, also Klaue was great as a villain but if you have Andy Serkis playing as a villain then it always is gonna be great. There was a moment that was a bit rushed in my opinion is that when they found black panther again, he was killed in ritual combat against Erik Killmonger and got pushed of the waterfall but it seems like it was only a couple minutes later that it was like, oh hey we found him again and he's alive, Hooray, and because of that we only saw killmonger as king for about 10 minutes, I would've liked to see more of him as king of Wakanda and show how evil of a king he is, especially after when the film seemed to make him look like the hero and everyone else the villain, we didn't see the soul stone which annoyed me a bit because now it's probably gonna rushed in infinity war when they are explaining what it does but u still do believe that is in Wakanda because why else would there be a massive attack there unless Thanos wants the Vibranioum, overall the film was brilliant and plot was great showing how tough it really is to be a king of a country and enemy's you may encounter on the way, the film had humour almost like any other mcu film, and the cast was great."

"kkaluhio","8","5","29","16 February 2018"," Solid 8.5..GO INTO IT W/LOWERED EXPECTATIONS
","I think this movie has a lot of mixed user ratings because we all hyped this movie up way too much. I think the excitement of a mostly-black movie got the best of us. We all wanted this movie to succeed. Luckily, before watching the movie, I saw some terrible reviews. Thus, I went into the movie with lowered expectations. THIS HELPED A LOT! Go into the movie with lowered expectations and you will be pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the change of scenery with the marvel universe. It was awesome to see a highly successful African country. I liked that no other avengers were involved in this movie as well. There was so much to explain with T'Challa. The movie was very visually appealing. Some of the CGI got out of hand, but that's to be expected in any Disney film. <br/><br/>Contrary to most of these reviews, I liked the character development (at least with Killmonger and T'Challa). Killmonger had very valid reasons for his motivation to be the ""bad guy."" T'Challa was torn between following his ancestors and expanding to help others. Both characters could be sympathized with.<br/><br/>What makes this an 8.5 for me is that it felt a little long. It probably could've been shortened by about 10 minutes. Along with that, the climax of the movie felt a little bland. The ending was meant to be a little heart-wrenching because T'Challa killed his blood relative, but the moment just wasn't fully captured (maybe it was the lack of climactic music?). Other than these things, the movie was enjoyable."

","Black Panther is Not Just Another Superhero Flick with the Typical Marvel Formula for its other Solo Movies, Directed By the Amazing Ryan Coogler Who is Known for his Critically Acclaimed Movies ""Fruitvale Station"" And ""Creed.
The Movie Takes place 1 Week After the Events of Civil War,Where T'Challa is mourning his father's death as he takes his rightful place as king of Wakanda, a fictional African nation ""hiding in plain sight"". But Things Shake Up When Movie's Main Erik Killmonger Played By Michael B. Jordan Comes into the Narrative Which Slowly Becomes one of the Best things about the Movie. Erik Killmonger's Motivation And intentions is Much More Deep And Complex Than showed in the trailer. One Of The Best Things About This Movie is how Every character from T'Challa , Killmonger to Other Supporting Characters is Really Well Written.
Coogler Doesn't Shy Away away from Breaking the Normal Superhero Theme Mould And Takes the writing into an Interesting Direction And Wins Another Gold For Marvel, Also the Movie Has Stunning Visuals And Badass Action Sequences.
Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa Or Black Panther is amazing in his Role And His Chemistry With Letitia Wright Who plays his Sister Shuri is a Delight to Watch. Other Actors Like Andy Serkis (Ulysses Klaue), Angela Bassett,Lupita Nyong'o,Danai Gurira,Daniel Kaluuya,Martin Freeman,Florence Kasumba Does Jobs but it's Michael B. Jordan Who Steals The Show With his Portrayal Of Erik Killmonger.

","This movie is a counterpoint to Thor: Ragnarok in the MCU. It's basically the same plot: a new king must secure his succession to the throne, and must fight challengers along the way. But when Thor is light and funny (and excellent in that regard), Black Panther is serious and surprisingly tragic. In each moment in this movie, the stakes are high, and the marvelous cinematography and incredible music are great to introduce us in the kingdom of Wakanda, and its magical ways and exotic costumes. <br/><br/>As a superhero movie, it's more deep, tragic and reflexive than usual. Really the characters are forced to face difficult questions, which the audience will find in a real moral dilemma to answer. This is not just the case of a stock villain trying to ""take over whatever"". There is a deep context in all the decisions the characters must face, and the movie is not trying to evade any of those questions.<br/><br/>Thor: Ragnarok was a celebration of fun and good times in a superhero movie. Black Panther was a reflexive introspection of the themes of supeheroes and violence. Both movies excelled in their settings, so both movies deserve the ""really remarkable"" score.<br/><br/>10/10"

It's colors, culture and plot development
are so, so perfect! Everyone from the hero of
the film, to the villian have deeply constructed
character and texture.The best thing is the
main antagonist of the progect-Erik Killmonger.
He is made so perfectly that it makes you to care for him and want him to win.On the
other side, Black Panther is complete character
that deserves the title ,,King of Wakanda,,, but in some way he is overshadowed by the villian.
The other side characters are very good, except
of Claw.Wacthing this movie we dive in a
other world full of new culture never seen before.We forget the real life and enter a new
fantastic place named Wakanda!!Of course it isn't perfect and it has plot holes and mistakes,

"kowsarahammad","10","2","8","30 October 2018"," 'Future & Technologies' had met 'Past & Heritage' ... shaped up a great superhero movie !
","If, there is a country of Africa, technologically advanced from the developed countries of the world - a few decades ahead, keeping themselves hidden from the war by disguising them as an underdeveloped country. Their spies are scattered all over the world, so it is a matter of time only to get the whole world controlled by their better war-arcenal. Such a mythical secret civilization has been developed by Black Panther Movie.<br/><br/>After events of Captain America: The Civil War, late 'King T'Chaka' is going to be replaced by his descendant as the rightful owner of throne, T'Challa. Opening up themselves in front of the rising world in order to help fighting against war and poverty, or keeping themselves isolated from the world like his ancestors, which one will he choose?<br/><br/>On the other hand, a black orphan child grew up in Oakland with his late father's fairy tale like story of Wakanda, his real home. In lieu of lies, genocide or any other costs, he wants to go back to there. Defeating T'Challa in the challenge to throne, he wants to impose colonialism over the colonizers who have gone through that for ages. So that, like the colonial Britain, the Wakandian Empire, never will see the sunset.<br/><br/>The most striking theme of the movie was the highlights of the Wakanda. Africa's ancient culture along with imagined future technology has emerged as an wonder. Productions and costume designs have to be appreciated. And the effects of Africa are also used in the soundtracks. To say, it is a Hollywood tribute for African civilization and culture.<br/><br/>This is the first time that black craftsmen dominate Hollywood's big budget movie. Chadwick Boseman in central character and Michael B Jordan's role in the role of villain Killmonger is commendable. Also, last year's Oscar nominee Daniel Kaluuya has flaunted an important side-role. Danai Gurira, Lupita Nyong'o, Forrest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, Sterling K Brown everyone is successful in their character. Winston Duke and Latitia Wright in the role of Man-Ape & Shuri respectively were heartwarming.<br/><br/>Ryan Coogler, the director, has succeeded avoiding clichÃ©s and giving new dimensions to the story, along with Joe Robert Cole. By salvaging personal experience and creativity, created a memorable superhero villain, who is hesitant to be called as the so-called evil entity. Having Marvel's time and storytelling restrains, witnessing so complete solo movie like this, was beyond imagination. Though the movie could have taken for more meaning, the movie will still be regarded as one of the best superhero movies."

"shetty-05258","8","2","8","25 April 2018"," Wakanda forever!
","Black panther starts out shortly after the events of civil war where we saw T'Challa's father die. Black panther follows T'Challa's struggles as both king of Wakanda and the Black panther. Ryan coogler has expertly crafted a film with relevant social and political commentary that never comes off as preachy while retaining all the elements of a blockbuster MCU film.<br/><br/>Black panther was a badass in civil war and Chadwick boseman brings the same gravitas and the stoic presence in Black panther. Although this time we get to see his emotional side as well and boseman brings a lot of depth to the character.<br/><br/>Marvel has nailed it with the casting almost every time and Black panther is no exception. Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis reprise their roles as Everett Ross and Ulysses Klaue respectively and without a doubt they are excellent as always. Everett Ross wasn't a big part of Civil war but here we get to see and learn a lot more about him and the same goes for Klaue whom we saw in Age of Ultron. Serkis' maniacal performance as Klaue was very entertaining and I wish he had more to do in this film.<br/><br/>In this film we get to see the Dora Milaje, that is the royal guard of Wakanda in action and learn a lot about them through their general Akoye played by Danai gurira who is loyal to Wakanda and respects her traditions. She has some of the coolest action scenes and is very intimidating. Nakia played by Lupita Nyong'o is a badass spy who travels around the world helping out people in need. The women in the film sort of play the voice of reason for T'Challa and contribute a lot to the plot. Shuri played by Letita Wright who is T'Challa's sister is the more modern character who things traditional rituals are boring. She is the head of technology so she's kind of a nerd but when its necessary she doesn't shy away from a fight.<br/><br/>Other notable performances would be by Angela Basset who plays T'Challa's mother and Daniel Kaluuya as W'Kabi. Also Forest Whitaker is in the movie who is superb and Winston Duke who plays M'Baku had some of the funniest moments.<br/><br/>Michael B. Jordan steals every scene he is in as probably the best marvel villain Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens. He has a lot of charisma and a clear motivation for why he does the things he does. His motivations are to do good but the things that he does to achieve his goal are wrong. Jordan nails every aspect of his character especially the emotional moments that helps the audience relate to him and care about him even though he is a bad person who has done despicable things.<br/><br/>Ryan coogler gives us a Wakanda that feels real and lived in and not a fictional country. Wakandan culture is rich and beautiful. Their traditions and rituals are interesting and there is a great contrast between their primitive culture and their advancements in technology which make Wakanda very different from the rest of the world. The visuals paired with an exceptional soundtrack with both traditional and modern music make for an immersive and surreal experience.<br/><br/>For all its merits Black panther is not without its flaws. The action scenes are sometimes really cool but other times not so good. There were moments when you couldn't understand what was happening because the scene was too dark. The green screen was noticeable in some scenes especially towards the CGI heavy climax of the film. The visual effects in Marvel films have always been very impressive in the past and its disappointing to see such bad effects in one of the best films the MCU has put out . The film also suffers from some pacing issues and Killmonger's screen time could've been extended.<br/><br/>A few gripes aside Black panther has some splendid performances, a compelling villain and relevant social commentary that makes it more than just a MCU film. Black panther is an exceptional film and I highly recommend it."

","Black Panther was all about the supporting cast. Everyone was interesting, everyone had a story or something they could do and they often saved the hero when he didn't plan things through properly. This humanized the characters in some way for me. There's also the very relatable villain, a jealous, unfairly-treated character with a burning temper. He's not a good person and he's not wholly bad. Andy Serkis too makes a great, nasty villain who i not in the film nearly enough.<br/><br/>The section of the film that worked best for me was when it felt like a James Bond film, a sequence near that start that is thrilling and well-choreographed and brings us action and technology in a wholly exciting way.<br/><br/>Costume design is fantastic throughout and some set-design really stands out, with the look of the Wakandan city as a whole slightly uninteresting and seemingly full of tower blocks you imagine might contain business, yet no one knows this place exists. Likewise the futuristic planes they fly around in are similarly uninspired. But the costumes and street-level views more than make up for this.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to anyone who like their action tempered with interesting characters, pretty design and high stakes."

","Black Panther - Really refreshing for the MCU, not that much was wrong with it, but this has a totally different vibe than most previous films, The Black Panther character itself owes much more to the Pulp heroes of 30's and 40's than most other superheroes around, and the high-tech spy thriller setting mixed with the royal family of an African nation and one of the Marvel's best written villains(anti-heroes?) yet, is a powerful combination!"

","I can't believe all the other reviewers giving 1 and 2 stars, I dont know whether they are trolls or not but it almost seems they are not giving it a chance.<br/><br/>Black Panther continues with Marvel's awesome track record of good films. But this one plays out more like a shakespearean tale rather than a superhero movie, which is good. The action sequences are the films weakest point, the political drama playing out being more interesting. This is in part helped by Killmonger character, Michael B Jordan totally rocking in this role. But he is not used to his full potential, I wanted to see more of him. Also having fun with his character is non-CGI Andy Serkis who looks like a genuine badass. All the others are pretty good too. Surprisingly this is one Marvel movie where they have toned down on the comedy making it seem the stakes are high and not something to be joked over. This is complimented with the awesome soundtrack which moves you and cheer for the kiing."
"cedargardenrd","8","2","8","20 February 2018"," A really good movie with a message
","I read the other reviews and for the first time I am going to say judge for yourself. Go see it. If you are a comic book fan base your opinion on how close the story is to the comics but then judge all the other Marvel Universe movies based on the same standard. 
If you are a movie buff base your review of the cinematography and direction against movies of the same genre.
But if you are like me and just want to go the movie to enjoy a fun time with a powerful message please see it. 
It is a shame that in 2018 everything is viewed through stained cloudy glasses of prejudice. This movie took the high ground and highlighted themes that are common to all people. 
See it as a fan, see it as a movie lover but most importantly see it a human being who can enjoy a story from a different perspective. I loved it,"
"PotassiumMan","8","2","8","20 February 2018"," Visually splendid, thought-provoking Marvel blockbuster
","The fight for the crown of Wakanda is wonderfully brought to life in this bristling film about T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) and his rise to power as king of Wakanda in the aftermath of returning to his home country and his subsequent struggle for his position when he is challenged by his rival Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan in an authoritative performance) whose father was killed by accident by his father a generation earlier.<br/><br/>First, the extraordinary visual effects. This sheer visual aspect of the film held my attention before I was sold on the film's underlying story. Even if you don't go for this sort of movie as a genre, you should nevertheless see it because its visuals demand being seen on screen. The film's stunning and lush realization of Wakanda alone is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Then, there is the powerful story of two viciously competing visions for the place of Wakanda in the world and confronting injustice and oppression against its people. This film becomes a surprisingly gripping debate between confrontation and pragmatism, between vindictiveness and conciliation. Killmonger and T'Challa come to epitomize the conflicting philosophies battling for the leadership of Wakanda. In that regard, it's a great political Marvel film as well.<br/><br/>I was impressed by how the whole cast gave this film so much vitality. Although Michael B. Jordan is somewhat underused in the beginning, his presence becomes more paramount and he shapes the film more and more as it goes along. Boseman is tremendously heroic and sympathetic in the title role. This is a Marvel blockbuster to remember when the dust settles. Strongly recommended."

My major cons with the film included the overuse of CGI and jump-cut action, both expected staples for modern Marvel films, alongside the 2+ hour run time felt which grew tedious by the third act.

"austin0731","8","5","31","14 February 2018"," A well balanced entry to the MCU
","In my opinion, Black Panther tells one of the more interesting stories on the MCU, featuring a cast of brilliant actors who bring Wakanda to life. Notice, how i coined Wakanda rather than Black Panther specifically, this is due to the fact that Wakanda was o much of a character in the film and so many of its culture, natural beauty and citizens were fleshed out and made a large part of this film. In fact a lot of time and dedication were gone into the other aspects of the film. <br/><br/>I thought that the film had one of MCU's more interesting villains as well, in the form of Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger, quite a lot is gone into his back story and as a street level villain I think he worked quite well. Much like the use of Vulture in Spider-man Homecoming. But, while in that case, the villain is menacing within a smaller 'street level' situation I thought in this case it's not necessarily Killmonger himself but what he represents that makes him the compelling villain that he is. Granted, he had a significant motive that can be empathized with he had a significant tie as to what he represented, the flaws in the former king T'Chaka and the conflicts that is bound to burden our hero T'Challa, the struggles he must make to choose between the right path and the path that would best benefit his people. <br/><br/>I also enjoyed the many characters from Wakanda, Danai Gurira's Okoye was a strong female character that was a badass. Letitia Wright's Shuri who was a fun and interesting character as well. There was a decent amount of comedy that does not come into the expense of drama that the previous Thor Ragnarok may sometimes be criticized for and on a whole was a thrilling ride.<br/><br/>All of which set in a setting that is stunning to look it, te blend of modern skyscrapers and vast mountains/valleys. And, the Wakandan culture, the rituals, the tribes, the vibrant colours all of which were presented in such a way that engages audiences and makes them grow more curious as to the many other facets of the fictional culture."

In addition, I am really thankful and grateful for the fact that the black females in this movie played a HUGE role in the saving of Wakanda and the women were very assertive and definitely had power of the men in some ways.

","This is more than a film. The Black Panther movie is a cultural phenomenon. A fresh and sterling example of how it takes the whole world to help the whole world achieve a higher and more salutary plane and state of survival. This should be painfully obvious, but evidently needs restating every now and then with all the ways and means available and at our disposal.<br/><br/>There is an understated depth and complexity to this movie that viewers and fans will be exploring and discovering and debating and enlightening themselves about for years to come. After the dust has cleared and settled from all the knee-jerk reactions and cultural shock, mine included, people will at length be done shaking their heads with a wry smile at how two Jewish Americans also members of a group persecuted throughout the millennia could somehow through a medium designed for soldiers at war and more particularly for children find themselves members among the unlikely authors of a re-genesis of African and Human Consciousness.<br/><br/>This is essentially what Jack Kirby and Stan Lee have done. Make no mistake about it. The Black Panther is the brainchild and the product of the Marvel Universe which is the invention and result of visionary artists and writers such as Kirby and Lee who postulated it into existence.<br/><br/>The appeal here is to the imaginative prowess of Mankind. Many writers and artists of color were so mired down in the angst of the oppression and exploitation of indigenous peoples around the world and their victimization that they were hard put to envision a place and a time where and when this would no longer be the case. Richard Wright was able to have his protagonist Bigger Thomas consider why Blacks did not have their own governments and armies in a nascent fashion, but his roadmap to Wakanda and other destinations of interest in Africa was somehow misplaced. Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Dubois were busily engaged in postulating an education for African Americans that might proof them against and preclude future involvement with slavery, but only Marcus Garvey and a few others, possessed the pluck, through whatever personal limitations, to suggest that there could be a United States of Africa or a Commonwealth of African States. We have yet to postulate a media which will celebrate the industrial, entrepreneurial, and technological triumphs of people of color in concert with the peoples of the world, bu this movie is a step in the right direction.<br/><br/>There is more that can be said and, I'm sure, will be said. But for now, let me just say, kudos to the cast and crew. You have done a monumental thing. Perhaps one day we will consider as well the Epic of Sundiata and Gassiere's Lute as appropriate grist for the Cinema..."
"rachmadmillentangkas","10","2","9","13 May 2019"," Black Panther is the most amazing movie of MCU
","Review : "" Black Panther ""
In mid February 2018 there is Marvel Studio's Afro-American superhero movie called Black Panther. The director Ryan Coogler (Creed, Fruitvale Station), along with actor Chadwick Boseman, black panther movie is in their hands to expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the spiritual sequel to Captain America: Civil War (2015) and find the mysterious Wakanda.
Black superheroes were never afforded the same deification. During the tail end of black cinema's golden age, Wesley Snipes' early-aughts Blade trilogy flirted with pop immortality, but even that character's legend faded across the years. I sometimes wondered, and still do, if black superheroes were ever meant to endure in the mainstream, the truth of America being what it is, or if the recurring image of black valor was too much of an irritant to the illusion Hollywood needed to project, to protect.<br/><br/>After the tragic events of Captain America: Civil War, T'Challa or Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) returns to his isolated and highly advanced nation of Wakanda where he takes his rightful place as king. Together with his younger, incredibly intelligent sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), his ex Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) and the loyal Okoye (Danai Gurira), general of the female Dora Milaje, he prepares his kingship.
Hidden from the outside world, Wakanda is an Edenic wellspring of hyper-advanced technology that balances African tradition and history with modernity. The central question of the film is how Wakanda will use this power: will they continue to horde their wealth, or use it to bring justice to oppressed people around the world?
In the opening scene of Marvel's Black Panther, a little boy's voice says: ""Papa, tell me a story...of home"".It's a fitting way to start the film, since the movie is very much about home and the stories we tell about it.
Director Ryan Coogler's film is absolutely amazing. The costume and production design by Ruth Carter and Hannah Beachler, respectively, is gorgeous. The cinematography is stunning, featuring soaring landscapes, waterfall canyons, and city markets. All of these things make Black Panther a well-woven tapestry of sights, sounds, action and adventure that is sure to impress even the most staunch critics of comic book films.
What I loved about Black Panther is that it is so much more than average superhero movies.While there are still many negative issues about racism against blacks, they are taking the right steps by focusing primarily on the African-American problem in the United States. The Black Panther film, on the other hand, portrays African culture positively in the media environment in which it is ignored, and it talks about the importance of preserving culture and traditions in a changing world.we are also confronted by challenging themes about how to act social change.
There are also many strong female characters in this film, from Okoye ,Nakia, , and Shuri to the palace guard, and even some of the elders on the council. Women hold many places of power and influence in Wakandan society. This is a refreshing change from the norm, and Coogler represents these women not just as secondary characters but as strong ,essential,and important figures in this movie.
With its hard-hitting action scenes, superb-pacing, moments of comedy and drama, stunning visuals, and a soundtrack to match, Coogler puts his best foot forward with Black Panther .We cannot say Black Panther is suprising or innovative, being the umpteenth Marvel flick. It is however extremely well executed. Thanks to its original setting, strong acting and subtle, yet important social message, Black Panther will be especially remembered as the ""Afro-American superhero movie at Marvel"" .
Black Panther film is a must-see for any and all fans of superhero films and comic books ,especially fans of Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), as well as anyone looking for strong, kick-ass female characters and a memorable villain."

Movie showed that every hero isn't unstoppable, they too are people, who get hurt in major ways. You understand villain's motivations and why he's doing all of it. It actually feels like the villain isn't a villain, he doesn't have an ""evil"" plan to rule everything. He's trying to fix things for others, that he didn't have.
Every character has soul in them and have a reason to exist in this movie. Actions have consequences, which will determine others doings.<br/><br/>It's not an over the top superhero movie. It shows us character and the impact of everybody."

","*BLACK PANTHER REVIEW* <br/><br/>Direction: Ryan Coogler knocks this out of the park, he's 3 for 3 when it comes to directing! He should hopefully be getting more work after this. <br/><br/>Story: Black Panther has a good but sometimes predictable story. While the story has some touching moments, it contains some familiar Marvel tropes.<br/><br/>Script: The script is excellent, containing good jokes and some powerful emotional dialogue particularly from Killmonger (coming up). It also provides an extremely relevant message, a type that Marvel or any other comic-book film has never done before.<br/><br/>Performances: Ooooh, the performances are incredible across the board! Chadwick Boseman does a nice job portraying a half superhero/half king and Lupita Nyong'o's great too. However, the real standouts are Okoye (Danai Gurira), Shuri (Letitia Wright), Klaue (Andy Serkis) and of course KILLMONGER (Michael.B.Jordan)!<br/><br/> Danai shows badass fighting skill while still having a heart, Letitia is HILARIOUS as Shuri as well as endearing and has excellent chemistry with Chadwick. Andy made me smile everytime he appeared with his goofy performance.<br/><br/> But then Michael comes in. Killmonger is 100% the best villain since Loki, a bad guy with clear motivations who allows you to sympathize with him. Michael somehow portraying him as enraged and charismatic simultaneously and leaves quite the mark on you even after the credits by giving many good points. I could make a whole essay on him if I could honestly, he's that complex...<br/><br/>Visuals and Other Aspects: The movie has stunning costume and production design (I LOVE Shuri's lab!). However, there is some bad green screen moments in some parts of the film.<br/><br/>All in all, Black Panther, while a little overhyped, is an amazing movie definitely worth seeing in theaters. If you get the chance, SEE THIS MOVIE!"

As of this moment right now when I'm writing, I've just completed reading and rating ALL of the 764 other comments previously posted here. There is a wide range of opinion. Sadly, my personal slant is lacking, because I mentioned the current U.S. leader once in a relevant context to BLACK PANTHER, but I spelled his name correctly. About a dozen of the other BLACK PANTHER remarks make some allusion to this individual (which begs the question of why MORE of them do not, since BLACK PANTHER does NOT exist in a political vacuum; it's probably the MOST political flick of 2018!), but the difference between what was nixed from me and posted from others was that they all misspelled the name of the Free World's leader. Evidently, this part of the web is being monitored by trolls whose mission in life is to create a fantasy world in which BLACK PANTHER exists, but not POTUS.

"verlon777","9","2","9","21 February 2018"," Black Excellence
","Another installment from the marvel comic book series: the latest installment brings to the big screen Black Panther played by Chadwick Boseman who in it plays the newly minted King T'Challa of a mythical, uncolonized Central African country named Wakanda. His ascendance to Kingship comes as the result of his father, T' Chaka, being killed in a terrorist attack by the antagonist (#1) Ulyssess Klaue who we soon find out is a South African jewel thief in pursuit of the mineral Vibranium to presumably make huge profits off of on the black market. Wakanda is rich in Vibranium that is exclusive to and the life blood of the country and has made it the most technologically advanced country in the world.<br/><br/> The film stays true to the origin of the comic book series while managing to include bigger yet subtle overarching themes such as black cooperation or the lack thereof, moral ambiguity, and isolationism vs black global solidarity for the greater good. Ryan Coogler is able to visually shatter and debunk the real life age-old myths perpetuated by white historians that Africa was/is a continent bereft of traditions and cultural achievement comparable to that of Europe thereby justifying colonialism. From the onset we see that this is a country steeped in rich traditions, pageantry, and government structure, and more advanced than much of the western world beyond just technology. While the movie is very much present-day and futuristic, it also at the same time pays homage to the best of an Africa past that has been written about and celebrated extensively by the John Henrik Clarkes, the Walter Rodneys, and WEB Duboises and so on of the world to counter the racist stereotypes of white historians. <br/><br/>The most compelling feature of the film for me was that this may have been the 1st time I can recall where a film of this magnitude (and enormous budget) didn't subject the beautiful black women characters to ancillary roles in relation to their male counterparts. Without having to mention it, the audience was able to see that Wakandans understood in order to have a progressive society, the women must be equally empowered as the men. All these women's characters had weight to them. Now, what I also found fascinating was the director's deviation from most comic book movies in its portrayal of the villain, Killmonger, played by Michael B. Jordan. It has been commonplace for a great deal of the comic book movies to typically establish what the villain's character arc and motives are which enables audience members to see a clear dichotomy between ""good"" vs ""evil"" but this film takes a detour from this cinematic comic book trope midway through by creating a moral dilemma that somewhat makes the villain a sympathetic character or at the very least a misunderstood antagonist (#2). <br/><br/>This movie was a success on so many levels; if I were absolutely compelled to nitpick anything I didn't like about the movie perhaps it would be the CGI that has become a bit overused for my personal taste in big budget super hero comic book movies but that was by no means enough for me to say it interfered with my view of the film overall. The movie was 2:15 minutes but the pacing was really good with no real lulls in it; I was left wanting more and can't wait to see if Marvel/Disney/Coogler can top this."

This is another amazing piece from Marvel universe with Black Panther making an impact in the class of superhero movies. The background story is amazing and so was the action till the very end. The part before interval flows slow but picks from the first action sequence on-wards. I observed that all the actors which not only the lead actors but also the supporting roles & extras really jumped in to make a Marvel Movie. Good job by the director Ryan Coogler to craft a wonderful movie that not only consists of just action sequence, but message about the African tribe how much significance they emphasize on vibranium and safeguarding it from evil purposes.

And it's visually beautiful. It's a delight, simply put.<br/><br/>Reviewers kneejerk-calling this film 'divisive' can only be explained by an ignorance of both world civilization history and current events, and an oversensitivity to topics they have the luxury of otherwise avoiding. The story and characters are NUANCED. Sometimes people do bad things while trying to do good things. This isn't new and it shouldn't be controversial in a story for adults.

","GRADE: B <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: Black lives really matter in this well-made movie, but it is hardly the ground-breaking innovative pop entertainment that one expects after all of the hype.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: The reviews are in for Ryan Coogler's Black Panther and they have been glowing...""A cultural phenomenon""...""A monumental achievement in filmmaking""...So is all of the hoopla justified or is this film simply a well-made example of a crowd-pleasing comic book action hero movie? Obviously, my opinion won't change any moviegoer's viewpoint as the film is on its way to be one of the highest-grossing films of the year. But review it I will...<br/><br/>Black Panther does follow the formula of most superhero movies: establish its hero and villain, build the conflict between them while laying out the mythology and origins, and creates endless CGI battles. The difference here is its predominantly African-American cast and crew overtly celebrating its own cultural heritage. The film also takes its time to delineate its supporting characters and make them fully-rounded individuals of merit. Kudos to that, and its message of social and political conscience found within its story.<br/><br/>The film firmly celebrates racial and gender equity in its depiction of an utopian universe called Wakanda. This isolationist African nation is a technically advanced place with a peace-loving population of various tribes who have no interest in being included with the outside world and its troubles. They purposely make their country's appearance as an impoverished third world country to our real world. But beneath its surface, there is a secret powerful substance called vibranium that protects this Kwanzaa territory and makes their Lion King into a Black Panther who will reign supreme. That is, until evil forces discover this metal for weaponry and corrupt power.<br/><br/>Yes, the basic set-up of superhero versus super villain remains intact and much of the film's beginnings are, while compelling, still long exposition posing as a story. Our hero is T' Chaka (a fine Chadwick Boseman) who is in love with a very independent woman named Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o, ever so classy). T'Chalka (a.k.a. Black Panther) becomes king and must stop the outside world from getting their stash of vibranium at all costs. Helping him is Okoye (a terrific Danai Gurira), a fearless female warrior, and her Amazonian army of bodyguards. This film uses women power to the max, another timely positive touch in this MeToo state-of-the-world mindset.<br/><br/>Mr. Coogler directs with skill and confidence. His debut film, Fruitvale Station, an under-appreciated crime film, showed a new talent to behold, and his second feature, Creed, established a director with an unique vision. This film, his third, shows a visionary craftsman that stages his action scenes with flair, especially his climactic battle on land and in air. His deft hand elevates this film from standard superhero mode to a film of importance and authority.<br/><br/>However, one wishes the screenplay by Joe Robert Cole and the director would have been more adventurous in breaking out of the standard issue formula found in this fantasy genre. It does, at one point, venture out and begins to resemble more of a spy homage to James Bond, complete with fast cars and gadgetry, but then it goes safely back to comic book land and gets lost in its overindulgence of CGI effects, some of which are too noticeably fake.<br/><br/>As written, our hero is rather a bland crusader whose supporting army of warriors are far more interesting than the main character himself. The world and characters spinning around him is a more exciting bunch. As with most action flicks, it must be the villains who have the necessary know-how to engage the audience. And in Black Panther, we have, not one, but two evil forces that are great foils. Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue is the antithesis of sinister evil as a black market arms dealer and makes a lasting impression, but stealing the film is Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger, one of the most memorable villains since Heath Ledger's Joker. Mr. Jordan is dynamic as the vengeful rival wanting to seize the throne. He brings a street-wise edginess to the narrative very convincingly and is able to give his complex character a tragic side as well, no easy feat.<br/><br/>Rounding out the cast are such talented performers as Forest Whitaker, Angela Bassett, Sterling K. Brown, John Kani, and Daniel Kaluuya. Also giving great support are British actors Martin Freeman as a C.I.A. agent (with a perfect American accent too) and Letitia Wright in a breakout performance as T'Challa's savvy sister, Shuri.<br/><br/>At the risk of sounding too kumbaya, Black Panther has its flaws, but it is a rollicking good time. It doesn't break any new cinematic frontier as one is led to expect by the critical hosannas, nor does it redefine film history (except for the fact that the film industry has now discovered a black audience's willingness to pay green). But as entertainment goes, the movie repeatedly scores...and that's no easy feat either."

","Black Panther serves justice. It has great villain, character development, deep story line. Some people are expecting more humor but for me it has just the right amount of humor. Ragnarok made itself a joke, Black Panther just gives enough kick for it to still be taken as a serious film. It digs deep into the culture and history, not just some shallow action scenes like other Marvel films. Best MCU movie to date. Go watch it."

","It's spoiler free. No Worries.<br/><br/>I came here and read the movie reviews from other users before start writing my own. I think it's more of preference problem for people who rated the movie as bad, even under average. I personally loved this movie.<br/><br/>Plot holes, sure there will always be plot holes in any movies. (Even in real life, the things that 'should go a certain way' can turn out to be the most nonsensical way though). Start with the cons, from my point of view, at some point the main conflict of the movie was pretty typical. The development pace of the movie can be a little inconsistent. <br/><br/>Not to mention there are some CGI disappointment. Marvel-Disney production is usually one of the most decent in CGI that you sometimes can't even tell. But in this movie, in some scene the CGI are too obvious and even to the level of you think you're watching some early 2000s or even late 90s movies.<br/><br/>Some fighting scene are just not to well shot. At some scene you can't see really well what is actually happening. The motions of the camera can make you suddenly feel motion sick, no joke.<br/><br/>The plot are pretty predictable, but it's still pretty great how the production team can make you enjoy how the story flowed.<br/><br/>The pros are that this movie really step out of the 'Comedic Fun Superheroes Movie' typical. It's serious, has a real issue for the character to face. It's more than just a superhero movie. It's about a growth of a man, a lifeshift of a 'prince' becoming a 'king'. It has become one of my favorite MCU movie after Civil War and Spider-Man Homecoming.<br/><br/>I love the performance of Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan. Both did great. Michael B Jordan delivers 'swag' to his role, though. Which is awesome.
While Martin Freeman is just being Bilbo Baggins, CIA version. (IYKWIM)<br/><br/>Musics are great. You will really love it.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is doing great. It makes you getting more excited and can't wait for the upcoming Avengers All Star movie, a.k.a The Infinity War."

","I just watched Black Panther<br/><br/>I enjoyed it at the cinema, but truthfully it has not held up for me on repeat viewings. Whilst I appreciate the cultural significance of the movie, a Best Picture Oscar nomination it did not deserve. It wasn't even the best Marvel movie of the year (That honour goes to Logan).<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman is slightly over shadowed by a ridiculously charismatic turn by Michael B Jordan. Forest Whittaker and Angela Bassett are both good, as are Danai Girira and Lupia Nyong'o It is Letitia Wright who steals the show as Shuri however, she is a delight.<br/><br/>The action scenes are all well done, but the final fight left me a bit bored as two faceless CGI characters slugged it out<br/><br/>Overall I liked it, I just do not get why it was so over praised."
"Leofwine_draca","5","1","3","7 December 2019"," Marvel's groundbreaker...
","BLACK PANTHER is well known as the first Marvel film featuring a black superhero, well supported by an almost all-black cast. Whether it stands up on its own as a decent film is another matter, however. In fact, I found this quite sloppy at times, despite all of the effort and talent involved with its conception. I liked the idea of the hidden African kingdom well enough, although too much time is spent on set up and I think they should have just hit the ground running as they've done in other Marvel movies.<br/><br/>The film is replete with action scenes, from hand-to-hand combat to a big car chase through the streets of Busan. The cast put in assured performances and can't really be faulted either. However, I was expecting more from the special effects, which aren't so special at times; the climactic scenes of the fighting rhinoceri reminded me unfavourably of the STAR WARS prequels at times. The writing is also a mixed bag, moving smoothly in Bond-style man-on-a-mission scenes but otherwise stalling, never quite achieving the gravitas it so desperately wants. It feels very much like Marvel knew they were taking a gamble with this one, so tried very hard to please everybody, but the end result is merely perfunctory."

"l-53204","9","1","3","3 June 2019"," A Marvelous Edition To The Cinematic Universe
","The historic, first of its kind, box office smash, Black Panther, has kept superhero fans at the edge of their seat; with excitement and it is safe to say, it did not disappoint. The 135-minute action-packed masterpiece directed by Ryan Coogler, featured an unparalleled cast led by Chadwick Boseman as the Black Panther, and Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger, along with many other actors who all played a part to set the bar high for what next in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The Black Panther was nothing short of perfection. The movie is based on the Black Panther comic series, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966. The comic book hero was first introduced to the cinematic universe in 2016, during the movie Captain America: Civil War. The Black Panther movie is based in the fictional country of Wakanda located in Sub-Saharan Africa. The country of Wakanda has been seen throughout the Marvel universe prior to the release of the film most famously in Iron Man 2. The combination of MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) easter eggs and a first-ever black lead cast for a Marvel film, lead to high excitement for superhero fans, and it is safe to say, they were not disappointed.
The movie follows the cookie cutter plot sequence of virtually every Marvel movie with the Black Panther as the protagonist, and possibly the most power-driven and cold killing villain Erik Killmonger as the antagonist. Even with a similar plotline to the rest of the MCU, the Black Panther brings forth a interesting change that makes the movie worth watching.
The movie was packed with mind blowing and clean cut CGI effects that helped drive the futuristic and luxury aspects of Wakanda. These effects were most noticeable as the Wakandan airship flew directly into the sub-saharan tree line and straight into the beautiful city of Wakanda.
The Black Panther features an Oscar award-winning soundtrack that radiates a futuristic yet traditional African sound. The score features many influential figures in the rap scene such as Kendrick Lamar and Travis Scott. Songs like Opps with Vince Staples and Yugen Blakrok, bring out the otherwise hidden emotions in certain shots of the film. This is seen through the intense and fast pace feeling brought out in the car chase scene that takes place in the neon-lit streets of South Korea. Other scenes such as the battle between Killmonger and T'Challa or the resurrection of the Black Panther, will leave you with tears in your eyes and a broken heart. The young and talented director did an unbelievable job illustrating world problems such as poverty and social injustice, through fictional events in Wakanda.
The movie was eye-opening to many and is definitely something everyone should see in their lifetime. After seeing the film it is clear there is room for a sequel and countless opportunities for the hero to appear throughout the MCU. The Black Panther is a superhero movie for the ages that will have a hulk-like impact on the cinema universe and an even bigger impact on black culture in cinema."

","The stories about superheroes who take part of a royal family are interesting, to see how the main characters would balance their responsibilities, between being a superhero around the world and being a king in the kingdom where they are from. The main characters would take important decisions for the good of the kingdom and its people, by making sure to not commit the same mistakes of the past that brought heavy consequences. Some of these stories would end with the sacrifice of the main characters, who leave to the people an important message to move forward with the kingdom. Other stories would end with the main characters surviving from a dangerous mission, who will then conclude with what they started. There was an interest to release in the MCU a solo movie about the character Black Panther, to see how he would move forward after the event of Captain America: Civil War. Until the young filmmaker Ryan Coogler came to release the movie about Black Panther, as he decided to make the movie differently than the previous MCU movies. In 2018 came out Black Panther by Ryan Coogler with Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Martin Freeman, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis. The movie's plot: The new king T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns to Wakanda, to assume the throne after the death of his father. In this hidden kingdom filled with incredible technologies, Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) comes to Wakanda with a reason to challenge T'Challa. There was a great risk to make Black Panther, as usually innovative movies became box office failure to be then appreciated years later as important cult. Instead Black Panther surprised the audience and the critics, to become a successful movie with more than $1.347 billion box office. Usually the superhero movies explore in the easiest way the theme good and evil, which is going to be already expected how the story would end. Instead Black Panther explored the theme good and evil in the complex way, to see how some decisions bring heavy consequences which makes the movie intriguing and original. The screenplay was elaborated to be clear how the story would be told, from the beginning to the end, without ruining the narration's rhythm of the story. The movie does not use any kind of clichés to be predictable, but it surprises with unexpected plot twists to be unpredictable. The production designer Hannah Beachler elaborated the settings of Wakanda in a particular way, as she took inspirations from the original Black Panther comic book's settings and also from some of Africa's settings to make the movie creative and visceral for the audience. The lightings, the colors and the camera make some of the most emotional scenes, atmospheric where the audience would get surprised. Some of the most spectacular moments of the movie look like atmospheric paintings, which make these epic scenes unforgettable and emotional in every shot angles. The costume designer Ruth E. Carter elaborated the costumes in a particular way, which make these costumes stylish also thanks to the colors and their forms. It is also interesting to see how some of the tribal costumes, are technologically advanced which make them creative. The score by Ludwig Göransson was creatively elaborated, as it uses orchestral instruments mixed with traditional African instruments. The musician Baaba Maal collaborated with Ludwig Göransson to make the score powerful, especially on the unforgettable tracks which he sang for the most epic scenes. Chadwick Boseman did an excellent performance as T'Challa who has to take an important decision, if Wakanda has to be kept as a secret kingdom or if it has to be revealed. It is an interesting part of the movie, to see what kind of difficult responsibility T'Challa has to take for Wakanda. Michael B. Jordan was really good as Erik Killmonger, who is one of the best villains of MCU. He is a character who has so much anger inside of his soul by searching the justice, in the most violent way for vengeance which can be understood the reason of his anger. Lupita Nyong'o did a well done performance as Nakia who is a strong character, she would do anything to help T'Challa whenever he needs. Danai Gurira did a well done performance as Okoye who is a proud Wakandan and T'Challa's bodyguard, she remains loyal to the Royal's throne no matter if some kings are good men or not. Finally Letitia Wright was excellent as Shuri who is T'Challa's younger sister, she creates incredible technologies to be even smarter than Tony Stark. The special effects were specifically elaborated by making the action scenes, spectacular and visceral in every single details to be breathtaking. Black Panther is one of the best and most creative superhero movies of all time."

","Black Panther<br/><br/>Dir: Ryan Coogler<br/><br/>Of course this will be biased...why wouldn't it be 😁 given being Black Panther's origin film into the MCU was fantastically told. I know that his background and family tree can get messy because of how extensive it is. Started the film with a flashback speeds forward into present day to tell what the flashback means. Was told really well because at first you can be confused on who is who in the flashback. The flow of the story wasn't out of wack were you could be lost as times surprisingly so everything fit together perfectly. The CGI was amazing seeing how they obviously had to depend a lot on it, the golden jaguar and black Panther suits were done soooo well and really give you an insight of what Wakanda really is. With every MCU superhero film I've noticed that they always have a ""hero"" moment or value that they tie into the film. It's a moment that the hero can prove why they are a hero. Black Panther managed to carry this moment out very very well. Like I said I'm obviously biased but per usual Marvel Studios can do no wrong. BTW there are two post credit scenes. First one after the first credits and the second after the full credits. Got to nerd out with the people around me for a min in between credits.

"nancyldraper","7","1","3","3 February 2019"," Beautiful People, Beautiful Production, Poorly Written
","Beautiful people trying to save a paradise. First and foremost this movie is a superhero backstory movie. I had to keep this in mind because I was distracted and put off by poorly written, undeveloped sub-themes. As much as it presented itself as African proud, a hidden culture built on science, technology and the idea of supercities, cloaked under rural Africa, there were constant failed attempts to connect these characters to the American Black experience, so much so they lost track of their own backstory. For example, toward the end of the movie there is a moment when a sympathetic villain thinks he is about to die and he defiantly says, something to the effect of, ""throw me into the ocean as so many of my ancestors chose to die rather than to live in bondage!"" This character's ancestors were never enslaved and shipped to America, his father went from a palace to America as a spy, and, he himself was an offspring of an aristocratic super society. So I hope you won't be distracted, as I was, from the driving force of the film which is the rise of a superhero, a celebration of heroism, strength and justice - the anthem of superheros. I believe there is inspiration in seeing people, who look like you, behaving nobly, and, so, I am glad to see a movie with a talented black cast telling super human stories. The acting was good, the CGI was spectacular as were the action scenes. The cast had many superstars, (British Martin Freeman, our token white person, playing a rough, tough CIA operative was remarkably convincing). I enjoyed the action adventure of the movie and the world it created.

"Uriah43","8","1","3","19 October 2018"," The Protector of His People
","This film essentially begins in ancient times with a meteorite composed of an incredible metal known as ""vibranium"" crashing into an area of Africa which is inhabited by 5 different tribes. Eventually, 4 of the tribes join together to form the nation known as Wakanda and use this new metal to advance their technology beyond anything the world has ever known. Equally important is the fact that a rare herb grown in that part of the world has been affected by the radiation from vibranium and, when ingested, gives a person superhuman abilities. This person is known as the Black Panther and he not only becomes the King of Wakanda but also serves as the protector for his people. Anyway, thousands of years pass and while the rest of the world advances Wakanda remains in geographical isolation and is thought of as an extremely backward country. But little does the world realize that Wakanda has technology beyond that of Western civilization and has chosen to remain isolated for fear of what might happen if their technology-and most importantly their vibranium-were to get in the wrong hands. That being said, when some vibranium is stolen the Black Panther is forced to go to America in secret and deal with the situation personally. Little does he know that his actions will have extreme repercusions for the rest of the world. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an excellent ""comic book"" movie that combined a dynamic plot, good acting and plentiful action throughout. I especially liked the acting of both Chadwick Boseman (as ""T'Challa"") and Michael B. Jordan (""Erik Killmonger"") who seemed tailor-made for their parts. On the flip side, however, I must also say that there were some minor flaws in the CGI and that I didn't especially care for the character of ""Shuri"" (Letitia Wright) who was unnecessarily annoying. But that aside, I enjoyed this film overall and I have rated it accordingly."

At the beginning of the movie no one could have predicted that N'jobu was Wakandan, he looked American. Plus, why would a Wakandan betray Wakanda? Movie gives us the answer.
Also that fall is in Wakanda in the savanna, not the mountains where the Jarbari live. Also those waters looked like they could drag someone under and I bet hitting rough water from that hight is like jumping off the Empire State and hitting the pavement. It's a miracle he survived that!
The acting was amazing, and that sunset is real in Africa. And its Killmonger not Warmonger. The action was really good and the CGI is great, so is the soundtrack. And the rhinos were cool! Who doesn't want a rhino in armor for defense?!<br/><br/>To morrisfotograf: 
These characters have value! And you see them develop.
Also, THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT STRYROTYPE!! This is the stereotype:
Black people are unintelligent and uneducated, they can't do anything right, they rape people and do drugs and alcohol, are ghetto, live in bad places, black fathers are big, dark, and southern, and guess what?! Black Panther shows black people as smart and amazing which we are!!<br/><br/>To dubwize: 
This movie is probably the best Marvel has made!<br/><br/>To generationofswine: 
This IS the best movie of 2018. Lots of people agree, so deal with it.<br/><br/>To marcximus1122:
The CGI in this movie is great! And the actors were great! This is the greatest 2018 movie!<br/><br/>To santiagocii: 
I gave this movie a 10 star rating because of its quality and plot. Because you know what IT IS!! You are the one who needs meds!!<br/><br/>To paul-tension-837-789381: 
Black Panther deserved the hype on this. Yes it was LITTLE overhyped but seriously its great movie! And the move is only about 3 hrs long, if you want LONG go watch a 24 hr movie!! Those actually exist!<br/><br/>To beglemanmark: 
Did you NOT watch the movie? It said that they were keeping themselves and their technology A SECRET! Plus, it's not Wakanda's problem if Tony Stark makes a self-aware huminoid robot.<br/><br/>To all and every single one of you 1/10 raters: I love this movie!! It deserves 10/10! The effects were great, there was humor, the characters were awesome and its a great plot! So stop being haters of Black Panther. Its a GOOD movie, with a GREAT plot, with the truth about who black people are and can be and do... TOTALY AWESOME!! So go on and get mad. Because Wakanda is truly forever!"
"Bydey","8","1","3","28 September 2018"," An Honest review. I don't understand how this movie could be rated 1-3 stars. SERIOUSLY???
","First off I will start by saying I am about the most honest reviewer on the planet. I like to say it like it is.<br/><br/>Second off I will say that I have an HD projector with a 100 inch screen in my basement with a full surround sound. This can make a huge difference when watching a movie. Especially with action movies.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was brilliant. Here is why.
It is completely different to anything I have seen of late. <br/><br/>The cast for a start. A mainly all black African American cast in a big screen movie. It just brought a whole new dynamic to the film.<br/><br/>The cinematography was unreal in this movie. I kept commenting all the way through it. I loved the whole African setting for a superhero movie. Again something different.<br/><br/>The music. An entire album was written for this movie and it's a very good album. How often does that happen?<br/><br/>I felt the acting was pretty decent. The storyline I didn't mind. I judge a movie based on the movie. Not on how the storyline was like the lion king or some other movie. What has that got to do with anything?<br/><br/>People of imdb what in the hell dictates a 5 star movie never mind an 8 or a 9 if this movie only gets a 1 star. 
1 star. 1 star?????????? Are you serious? I am literally laughing at the thought of what people think a bad movie is. I've seen horrendous movies and I mean terrible movies but i still gave them a 3 for what they did right. <br/><br/>I gave this movie an 8 star and that is a true retrospective of the entertainment value that this movie provided me with on my given night to watch it.<br/><br/>Don't be put off by terrible biased reviews. Judge for yourself."
"edge973","5","1","3","27 September 2018"," Michael B. Jordan just isn't good, no matter how hard they try.
","Seriously, he is bad in every movie I have seen him in. Someone in Hollywood is REALLY trying to push him, to maybe make him a new (another?) Will Smith, but he just is not it. Fantastic Four had some flaws but I think it could was watchable if not for him. In this movie, his ghetto, thug rhetoric is so out of place and painful. Yeah, I know, his character was born there, but he was also educated and trained as an elite soldier yet...just no. <br/><br/>Others have rated and reviewed the hell out of this movie, There is nothing more I care to add that hasn't been said, other than quit casting Michael B.

"nyeekasmalls","8","1","3","6 September 2018"," If you aren't black, you'll probably hate this....
","It's unfortunate to see so many bad reviews of this film but I understand why. If you are a black person there are themes that you just can't miss that are close to home and the film really speaks on the relationship between African people and black Americans. So many non black people grip about this movie but it is actually very deep. Unfortunately white America is already acclimated to in depth and complex narratives of people that look like them. And, Unfortunately people of color get the short end of the stick with terrible predictable films. I can't name five truly sophisticated non stereotypical black films so of course you have people over the moon excited about it. It's one of the only films where there is a positive black male lead.<br/><br/>This movie is wonderful for children of color. It is one of the first films that reinforce self esteem. ""Show him who you are"" is pivotal. The whole idea is knowing who you are and where you come from. Black Americans have been stripped of an identity, as was Killmonger, thus being the driving point of all his rage. If you are outside of the culture and never cared to learn about black culture all of the themes will go over your head. This film shows the power of a nation that is perceived to be impoverished, which is clever and revealing about people who do not want to share their information for fear that it will destroy them, much like Africa and all its resources. A young woman is the head of technological advancement and uhhh the military is all female! That speaks volumes but you just won't get it if you aren't black, which is fine but there is no need to hate a movie that doesn't cater to your perception of the world as many films do.<br/><br/> this film gives real history vibes, Wakanda resembles a place called Lesotho and Eric Killmonger resembles a man named Shaka Zulu. If you aren't cultured you complain about CGI and a story line you don't understand. I saw a complaint about people flying across the room when being hit but they clearly didn't pay attention to the fact that the vibranium collects energy and redistributes it, or that T'Challa has super human strength. Don't view the movie as the best marvel movie out but a decent attempt to demonstrate powerful black culture in the form of a super hero because you know Hollywood wants you to believe it can only be done in a fantasy world."

","This will be short and sweet. After about 1 hour, I'm still trying to figure out if this is a Black musical, Black culture movie, a Crime solvers movie, or a bizarre ethereal movie...'cause it sure as heck isn't a super hero movie, which I thought it was supposed to be...<br/><br/>The plot, if you can find it, seems to be about a wannabe super hero, that people saw in another movie (I didn't, sorry), who goes back to his mysterious, technological country, that happens to be invisible, to do something that I never did figure out, but was sorta explained in the synopsis, that didn't make sense to me anyway...<br/><br/>So, you see, I'm rather lost on how to give this one a knowledgeable review...<br/><br/>But I tried, heh heh...<br/><br/>**Update 45 minutes later**<br/><br/>Ok, I think I figured out why this movie is so slap dash boring to me...apparently Marvel decided to produce Black Panther as only an International (foreign) release, so it doesn't fit into an American concept of a superhero movie...then decided to subtitle half the movie, and released it in the US too...THAT is as much sense as I can make out of it all..."
"weirdguy35","2","1","3","16 August 2018"," I honestly don't understand why people like these movies
","This was the first Marvel movie I had watched in over 4 years, and man did I hate it. <br/><br/>I've always hated marvel movies, because of how predictable and boring the stories are. I mean, sure, they're well made movies, but holy crap. Why do people find these entertaining? All marvel movies play out the exact same. Introduce the protagonist, then the antagonist, insignificant stuff happens, a character ""dies"" then comes back, the 2 fight at the end, then all is well. Repeat 20 times with a different skin. <br/><br/>This movie was no exception. I don't care that the almost the entire movie is black, I actually think that's awesome. I wish we had more movies that did this. My issue is this movie follows the formula to a T. It was just so boring. <br/><br/>I will say, I did like a couple of things they did. I liked the costume and set design. They were amazing. Music was also nice. It was something different. The villains in this movie were also a little better than your standard marvel, but still not anywhere near the level of other villains in different movies. I've heard some people say the villain was very relatable, but he just seemed a bit too forced to me. Not to mention the political messages were so in your face it was ridiculous. 
*Spoiler* When Michael B Jordan's character said something like ""there are thousands of black people everywhere that need help"" or whatever, it was just so on the nose that it was ridiculous. What they could have done instead is maybe show more of what is wrong with black society, maybe show a bit more of the villain as he grew up. Let us see something like that. That way we can empathize with him. See what he struggled with. Because otherwise, he's just a villain. And that's all there is to it. *Spoiler End*<br/><br/>Overall, just another cliche marvel movie with a different skin. Although this one is maybe just a tad better than the others, it still has the same weaknesses. If you like marvel, you'll like this. If you're like me, you'll hate it. If I had to recommend it to somebody, I'd say don't watch it. It was awful."

"william-03717","2","1","3","29 July 2018"," Fantasy movie, not superhero
","Stopped watching after an hour, I just kept hoping it would get better or start actually making some kind of sense. I can buy the fact that ""vibranium"" is a real element. But the Panther gets his power from some kind of magic potion, which is also able to take his power away. So what is the point of having vibranium? Every character from Wakanda was able to fly or perform ""superhero"" type abilities. I was so confused!! No explanations for anything, you just watch people doing things (such as flying) with no explanation of how they do it. If you are the type of superhero fan that can buy into Superman flying, or Batman or Iron Man having millions of dollars to devote to R&D, or the Incredible Hulk or Spiderman being radioactive, well, this is totally different. Those other movies at least have some kind of scientific explanation, even if some of the science isn't proven yet. There is no science here, no depth of characters, no one to actually ""root"" for. And of course, because it was a ""black superhero movie"", they had to base the movie in Africa. So cliched and an insult to the viewer's intelligence. Sure there are worse movies, but right now I can't think of one."

"higherborder","1","1","3","27 July 2018"," Very, very bad
","I could easily stop there because basically, there's not much to be said about this movie. But, out of respect for the Marvel franchise, the comics and people who paid to see it, I think that few comments are in place. So, as I said, the movie is very, very, very bad. Everything about it is bad. First of all, it is not a superhero movie which is a little bit strange considering that it is a superhero franchise. The movie is clearly about racial and social issues and that is totally acceptable in some other context but in this situation, it really stands out from the rest of the films and it feels very isolated from the whole franchise. Secondly, these issues were so poorly investigated and presented that it felt like it was a science project by an elementary school student. The acting is quite weak and it seems like the movie was written and directed by an amateur. Also, it was boring. The trailer was far more exciting than the whole movie. CGI was also bad. The relationships between characters felt quite unnatural and forced. 
Black Panther was a great character in Civil War but in this movie, it kinda lost everything that made him relevant. Considering how much hype this movie had, how it was praised that it's going to change the future of Marvel and serve as a culprit of future installments, I was very, very disappointed by it. Everything in the movie looks weak, not developed enough, and it is by far the lowest point of Marvel production. 
The most devastating effect that this movie had (in my opinion) is that I am sure it has ruined the picture of Marvel for most people, especially for those who were not familiar with Marvel before. The movie was praised more than any other in the MCU which I think is a sign of disrespect for other great movies MCU has delivered."

","This movie was supposed to be centered around Black Panther, T'Challa, and make him seem like another important member of the Avengers. Obviously, Marvel Studios strayed away from the comic book version of this hero as well and made T'Challa extremely boring and not as intelligent and capable as his publication counterpart. Throughout the movie, he gains no character development to show that he's a worthy character. This makes things worse as he already doesn't have his trademark intelligence in the MCU version. Instead, his sister, who is hardly a major component in the comics, become the smart person T'Challa was supposed to be. <br/><br/>Killmonger was another stereotypical villain just like a lot of other villains in other movies, where he masks his emotions by saying he wants to do something good. Like he obviously doesn't care about the stuff Wakanda does with the public more than his feelings about his own life that was messed up due to losing his dad and living in a awful setting. It's kind of how Thanos acts like he's being merciful by killing half the population due to ""resource limits"" when in reality he wants to please Death by killing and not supplying the universe with resources like any sensible person would. Also like how Aldrich Killian had his feelings hurt and that's why he wanted to do all that in Iron Man 3.<br/><br/>Also when you saw the other gold suit in the movie, you someone was going to steal it and use it against T'Challa. Classic."

The female characters overahadowed the males all the way through the movie which made the star of the film not the star. I was left feeling dissapointed by the whole thing especially the appualing soundtrack. If i could rate it with less stars i would but danai guarira and martin freeman earned these 2 stars. The fight scenes were lame no funny moments well at least if there were jokes the whole seriousness of the movie hid them well. Was not very entertained at all. Marvel need to buck up there ideas a bit as this was a flop. The fact that most of the cast were black meant nothing to me the only issue i had with this was the rubbish accents from most.

"Wuchakk","6","1","3","12 June 2018"," Overrated due to political correctness; it's noble and has its points of interest, but it's also kinda meh
","RELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Ryan Coogler, ""Black Panther"" details events when T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) takes over kingship of the hidden African nation Wakanda after his father passes (John Kani). The kingdom is technologically advanced due to its secret resource Vibranium, a priceless, almost magical metal. Unfortunately, T'Challa's reign is challenged by an angry American former-black ops soldier, Erik ""Killmonger"" (Michael B. Jordan).<br/><br/>With its black director and mostly black cast (with a couple of token white dudes), ""Black Panther"" was overhyped and overrated upon release. Critics were apparently afraid of being called ""racist"" by liberal fascists if they dared to be honest and say anything negative (rolling my eyes). The movie's likable and certainly has its points of interest, but the characters are rather dull, except for Killmonger, and the story isn't all that involving. It's basically a mediocre superhero movie that has some blatant Bond-isms and is set apart by its primarily black cast and African locale. It fails to rise to the entertainment level of even ""Ant-Man"" (2015).<br/><br/>Still, it's respectfully noble and the story provokes interesting questions, like isolationism vs. internationalism and African-American culture vs. Native African culture. But there's some eye-rolling bits, like when Shuri (Letitia Wright) calls CIA agent Ross (Martin Freeman) a ""colonizer,"" which isn't even accurate. Maybe it was supposed to be a joke.<br/><br/>The waterfall fight between the Black Panther and Killmonger was an homage to the first issue of The Black Panther series in Jungle Action: Issue #6, September, 1973. At the end of that comic's story T'Challa and Erik fight at the top of a waterfall culminating with Killmonger throwing Black Panther over the cliff. This issue was the beginning of the ""Panther's Rage"" storyline by Don McGregor (featuring artists Billy Graham, Rich Buckler and Gil Kane), which ran for over two years in 13 issues of Jungle Action #6-18 and 209 pages, including the Epilogue. Many consider it the first graphic novel. Of course, this wasn't the first appearance of the Black Panther (who debuted in 1966), but it was the first issue where he was the starring character. <br/><br/>And it was this series that provided the intriguing exposition on T'Challa, Wakanda and its citizens, visitors & enemies. It's a travesty that McGregor, who created the characters of Killmonger & W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) and conceived this exposition, wasn't acknowledged in this movie; shameful.<br/><br/>THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 14 minutes and was shot in Georgia (Atlanta, Fayetteville), South Korea (Busan) and Iguazú Waterfalls, Argentina. Ironically, nothing was shot in Africa. WRITERS: Coogler and Joe Robert Cole (and, uncredited, Don McGregor).<br/><br/>GRADE: B-"
"micklang-83310","2","1","3","9 June 2018"," Severe RACIST overtones erode the excellent digital effects
","In today's PC world of 'you can't be racist if you're black' mentality, it gives the green light to shows such as Black Panther-- Marvel's way of 'gifting' the world a picture to make all other races feel an undeserved guilt and to defend themselves from being accused as racist themselves.
Every scene had a white-bashing, anti-American narrative for a country that clearly explains how it's OK to exist in a virtual utopia, while letting the rest of Africa be eaten by parasitic worms, die of malnutrition and spread AIDS like wildfire.
The accents were way over the top. Have any of the producers or actors had linguistic coaches involved? At one point, you'd think that some of them were from Jamaica.
The story falls apart almost from the very beginning. A society that had such advanced technology wouldn't obsessively embrace living like they were still in the stone age. 
Sigh. 
If I had to speak of any positives in this film, it would be the visual effects were quite good-- except for the CGI fights involving Black Panther as they broke the laws of physics in every scene. I don't care how good your armor is-- if you get flung against a concrete wall at 100mph, your insides would turn to a fruit smoothie.
A big stinking D- for this movie! How people raved about it, I can only guess-- either they were fully shamed into hating their whiteness or loathed the fact that they were born under an American flag, I have no idea. Did Louis Farrakhan or Al write the screenplay? All this movie did was stoke racist emotions under a thin story that you could fully guess within the first 10 minutes of watching the introductions of the characters."

"antoniokowatsch","7","1","3","19 May 2018"," Impressive visuals and an amazing film score
","First off I would like to say that I've deliberately put off writing this review. I was quite conflicted because of the overwhelmingly positive reactions that this movie managed to accumulate. I will preface this review with stating that it was a good movie but ... at the same time it felt like it was lacking certain storytelling aspects. But we'll get to that in a second.<br/><br/>Based on the fact that it is one of the highest grossing movies of all time some people made the assumption that it is a ""monumental"" superhero movie that is akin to ""The Dark Knight"". I disagree with that statement. The movie was fun to watch but it wasn't as ""monumental"" as the Dark Knight movie. Furthermore I'd like to point out that a movie's box office performance isn't necessarily a good indicator for its storytelling aspects. I personally like to believe that the movie seemed a little bit boring at times (especially during the middle segment). It only got really interesting when the villain finally showed up, which took some time. But then again, this is an origin movie so you have to expect everything to take twice as long as usual due to the limitations of the genre. And once the user is fairly accustomed with the origin story things can progress at a much faster pace. All origin movies have to struggle with this odd pacing. Which is also the reason why I'm not very fond of origin movies in general (despite their importance to new viewers).<br/><br/>The film score was amazing. Ludwig Göransson did a really good job composing it. It was super authentic due to its many ethnic elements and added a great deal of depth to the overall ambiance of the movie. The cinematography was also quite breathtaking. With those awesome aerial shots of the African landscape and the interesting camera angles. Like e.g. that one scene where the camera swivels horizontally as Killmonger walks into the throne room. That one was a pretty cool shot that you don't really see that often. Actually, now that I think about it the movie had a lot to offer but I simply feel like the story itself wasn't quite on the same level. Let me explain:
Out of all the protagonists it really seemed like T'Challa was the least interesting one, which is pretty weird considering that it's a movie about him, the Black Panther. Killmonger and Okoye e.g. were far more compelling characters, just to put it into perspective. My biggest criticism however concerns a pretty obvious storytelling flaw; the lack of character development.
Okoye was probably the only character that grew/""changed her ways"" when push came to shove. The UN speech that T'Challa gave at the end made for the perfect ending but it also felt very forced to me. At no point did he even ""consider"" to metaphorically break bread with other nations. Not even when Nakia, his ex-girlfriend who he still has feelings for, suggested it. It just seemed odd for him to do a total 180 on a subject matter that he used to be so stoic about. So yeah, I would say it wasn't very believable.<br/><br/>A minor thing that I would also like to mention is M'Baku's demeanor. In the comics he's far more antagonizing. After all he's one of Black Panther's arch enemies. He definitely seemed a little too friendly in the movie (if you know the comics). And yeah, in the comics he goes by another moniker: ""Man-Ape"". The director however decided to simply go with M'Baku instead because it might be racist? I personally don't agree with that decision. Man-Ape isn't a racist name for a villain. Especially once you realize that M'Baku and his tribe are literally worshiping the gorilla gods in the comics. It makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>On a side note:
The Black Panther suit received a well-deserved design-upgrade and looks much better than the one from the comics. It's very aesthetically pleasing with all those streamlined metal spike adornments. I dare to say that it's arguably the best looking suit in the Marvel CMU to date (the only contender would be the ""Iron Spider Man""-suit but we have yet to see it on Peter Parker). <br/><br/>At the end of the day the movie was more like an appetizer. That's at least what I took away from it. I'm convinced that the Black Panther and Wakanda will probably play a bigger role in the upcoming Marvel movies. 
I'm also pretty certain that the sequels will be much better. Mostly because they won't be origin movies.<br/><br/>Final verdict: recommended"

Every hero in these movies gets heightened if the ""BAD"" guy/anti-hero is great. From that perspective the movie is greater than initial expectations.<br/><br/>But......
Black Panther's role in MCU is the equivalent of Batman in DC. Gadjet,ninja,scientist, and acts in shadows and is always prepared for everything.<br/><br/>T'challa(Chadwick Bosman) is not fitting for the role. He is pretty much younger than the hero of the comic, he is not putting a serious-shadowy figure of the comic character. He is also very charming and sometimes his baby-face is not fitting the ""blackness"" of the character, at least from the comic perspective. <br/><br/>I rated this with 8,but with a better T'challa it would be a pure 9."

It's a shame because I really wanted to like this one since I didn't really know much about the comic book character at all."

","There is a lot of bial and hate in these reviews. Some or more of it seems racially or politically motivated. Others are either being movie snobs or just being contrarian. <br/><br/>You don't have to think it's the greatest superhero movie ever (which it isn't) or the best Marvel movie (for me, it's not), but this was an excellent movie. <br/><br/>For those who say the acting was wooden, what are you comparing this movie to? ""There Will Ne Blood""? ""The Godfather""? This is an action movie. Characters are meant to represent archetypes. There is not enough time to flesh out every character on this scale. T'Challa and Erik Killmore were the main characters. Their struggles were the core of the movie. This is not Game of Thrones, where you have 8 seasons to give depth to 15-20 characters. Compare the acting in this movie compared to the latest Transformers (or any of them really) or the latest Pirates of the Caribbean, and it's no even funny how superior this movie is to those. If you the no the acting in this movie is bad I question if you know what quality acting is, beyond what hip culture tells you (I know the type, I use to be a part of that culture)<br/><br/>Those who attack the plot, it's a comic book movie. It's an excellent one, but one none the less. Still, it was ambitious in its scope. It was faithful to its heritage and shows black characters beyond typical movie tropes. Black characters are in Black Panther were superheroes, scientist, warriors, and a villain who was relatable. You shouldn't have to be black to appreciate this (I'm not). <br/><br/>To the rest of you, you clearly have problems with this movie that more racially and politically motivated. Is the idea of a movie that portrays a world that has been unfair to people of African dissent so offensive? Where the points of view of some of the characters wrong? No. If it offends you politically, that's your problem. Open your mind and look at the world for what it is. If you can't see the world from others' point of view, then you are the problem, not the movie. Just shut up and let others enjoy the movie. <br/><br/>Ultimately the movie had a positive, inclusive message. It was innovative and superbly directed (Coogler is on a roll). Haters go away."

","Black Panther (2018)<br/><br/>This is a superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. T'Challa (Black Panther), returns home as king of Wakanda but finds his sovereignty challenged by a new adversary, in a conflict with global consequences. It is the eighteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It stars Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, and Andy Serkis. Critics considered it one of the best movies set in the MCU and noted its cultural significance. It received praise for its screenplay, direction, performances, action, costume design, production merits, and soundtrack. Notwithstanding, the CGI effects received some criticism. It grossed over $1.3 billion worldwide, earning it the highest-grossing film of 2018, as well as the third-highest-grossing film ever in the United States. Audiences gave the film an A+, the second superhero film to receive that grade after Marvel's own The Avengers. I found it a solid stand alone film, but it delivers a limited connection to the MCU other than the death T'Challa's father, albeit the plot engine for the film. Definitely one of the better movies of the series, but not sure if it's my personal favorite."

I just don't know but no one in their right mind watching this can tell me lines like ""when I tell you to do something, I mean that sh**!"" or any other forced west side slang really fit in to this role.

In my opinion, only one first movie in the MCU, for one particular character, that was really awesome, was the Iron Man. But if we compare Black Panther with Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange... it was completely the same, just an introduction to a character. I didn't compare it with the Guardians of the Galaxy cause Guardians are just different kind of story. They didn't bother to introduce you too much with the backgrounds of Star-Lord, Drax, Gamora, Groot and Rocket, they just mentioned it through the movie. 
Black Panther just introduced you with Wakanda, main characters, history, vibranium, technological advancement, tradition ... and it's just a beginning."

","I saw this film in the theater and was surprised! Finally Marvel made a superhero movie with a unique score! And that's where my praise for Black Panther ends.<br/><br/>This film is the same old Marvel scheme. With the added bonus of being ""political"" I cannot believe how highly this film has been praised. It's far from Marvel's best work and to be honest, the race aspect of it seems forced and frankly, leads no where. The film leads it up the whole movie, but falls short of breaking out of the Marvel formula.<br/><br/> I don't understand why Marvel of all franchises attempted to make a political film. Yes, I think this film is political. Although if I were to describe this film in one word, it would be ""pretentious.""<br/><br/>This film brings nothing new to the table, save a change of skin tone. I understand why it is successful and why people praise it. But many other films (films more artistic and/or serious than a Marvel film) have portrayed a similar, if not exact copy, of the story presented in Black Panther. <br/><br/>I liked the soundtrack, but the film itself was a Marvel movie, and it showed. Overall, I like the film, but is not a masterpiece and in my opinion is the same caliber of film as Iron Man 2. It is thanks to this film I understand the super hero movie fatigue."

"12_Monkeys","8","1","3","9 April 2018"," A refreshing script in the Comic Character world
","It's now been a while since I actually enjoyed watching a superhero flick at the movie theater. Don't get me wrong, I used to LOVE superhero films, but ever since the formula worked so well (money wise) for the studios, the scripts have unfortunately lost all meaning. Thank God, this is not the case for Black Panther.
Although the film does start somewhat as a low-paced, vfx plastered (specially in the fictitious world of Wakanda), cliché adventure film, if you can power through the first 10 to 15 minutes or so, you're gonna be in for a treat.
What I loved most about Black Panther is the fact that each and every important character in the story has a well shaped backstory, they all have clear motivations for their actions, and the melodrama of the family relationships works perfectly, because it gives all of the main characters a conflict that is much needed in these types of films, and as we move forward, the plot thickens, and the stakes rise. All in all, a well written film with marvelous performances (even in small roles, as Sterling K. Brown shows us).
The script finishes off with a much needed message that envelops the whole point of the film: ""...in times of crisis, the wise build bridges, while the foolish build barriers."" The relevance of this film shoots up to the sky, when the theme is so intertwined with what's going on in the world right now. And the fact that the screenwriters managed to write in a message like this, in the context and with the studio pressures that come with a blockbuster type of film like this one, is something to stand up and clap about, if you ask me.
I can only hope that the sequel to this film does the first one justice, and I can almost be sure it won't, but oh well... that's Hollywood."
"anselmdaniel","7","1","3","8 April 2018"," An interesting look even if formulaic
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Black Panther is a continuation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that centers on the Black Panther characters that was first introduced in Captain America: Civil War. T'challa leads the African nation of Wakanda, a technologically advanced isolationist country using vibranium. T'challa formally becomes the Black Panther in a ritual but soon discovers an old historical relic that seeks to undo his legacy. Killmonger is revealed to be his uncle's son and seeks the throne of Wakanda for himself.<br/><br/>Black Panther is a riveting movie focused on its action set pieces and its setting. Much like the other Marvel movies, Black Panther has highly explosive and plot important action set pieces that have cool effects. The directing is much better at the action rather than the character dialogue. The dialogue has a different feel from the more humorous entries of Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy. Black Panther adopts a more serious tone with some touches of comedy. Overall the dialogue is well written and helps bring the viewer into the setting. The setting of Wakanda and characters is easily the more interesting part of this movie. The movie uses this to its advantage by doling out parts of the setting and environment in bits. The culture and people of Wakanda is its more interesting part and by the end of the movie, I still wanted to know more about it.<br/><br/>The main arc with Killmonger and T'challa hit some emotional moments but eventually descends into typical superhero stories. Killmonger creates a villain for Wakanda to prioritize. He then returns to the hidden kingdom to enact revenge for his father. He accomplishes this by seemingly killing T'challa and becoming the new Black Panther. Somehow a kingdom that embraces tradition and isolationism embraces his violent actions and commands without rebellion. The movie wanted an excuse to have a large scale battle but did not have the heart to back it.<br/><br/>Overall, Black Panther is a strong entry into the Marvel cinematic universe. I would recommend this movie.<br/><br/>Grade: C"

"b2280545","7","1","3","27 March 2018"," The Best Marvel Movie of 2018?
","To say that Black Panther is the best Marvel movie of 2018 feels pointless since we have yet to see the rest of 2018's Marvel films, including Avengers Infinity War, Deadpool 2, Ant-Man and the Wasp, and Venom. This film created a massive wave of audience and critical praise as if it were a landmark. This is primarily due to how it managed to shine the spotlight on a fictional African universe that was visually as appealing as Thor's universe, Asgard. For many people of African decent, this was their movie. However this wasn't the first black comic book film to be released as many say it is. It may be in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but if you're asking for the first comic book film based on a black protagonist, the Blade franchise beat Black Panther to it. What Black Panther is is Marvel's first African superhero film to take place in the MCU, set in his country with the majority of the secondary characters being African themselves. The fact that there are fewer white skinned protagonists in the film than there are black gives it great significance. <br/><br/>In that aspect, Black Panther succeeded to make a superhero film set in Africa. Culturally, it hit home, as fictitious as it is. That goes for the characters, who were not only likable, but great to watch as the heroes of the film. It just goes to show anyone of colored skin can portray great, appealing and heroic characters. The character of T'Challa/Black Panther is about as heroic as it gets. Following his story from Captain America Civil War, we are given a different T'Challa, the noble, brave king willing to sacrifice himself for his people and for all rather than the T'Challa driven by vengeance in Civil War. The other characters also fit in well in the world of Black Panther, most of them anyways. The Black Panther suits visually appear stunning and are taken to new levels of power.<br/><br/>The hype of a film can often times succeed or ruin the experience for some 
viewers expecting to witness a triumph in film making history but were given instead a shipwreck. This was sadly the case for Black Panther as the film wasn't without obvious problems that take away from it's highlights. Black Panther was not a disaster either though it was no where near being the best of the Avengers Universe franchise. 
 
For starters, the film's main antagonist, a believable performance delivered by Michael B. Jordan, brings forth new aspects to a villain not often seen in films including films from past MCU entries. A villain character who creates turmoil for audiences and leaving them undecided as far as their feelings go towards the character, are they for him or against him? That is immediately a win going for the film. Michael B. Jordan's character's motivations for doing what he does are understandable to the point where one feels great sympathy for him despite being the ruthless villain that he is. That is a special ability whenever a film goes for that impact. Although for the first act of the film he remains hidden in the shadows with the spotlight landing on Andy Serkis' character, who kills his role perfectly as he always does. Serkis plays such an interesting character, one that isn't performed through motion-capture performance as he is known for the most, that it is a shame he got killed off. Furthermore it feels like a mistake that the film killed him for he had excellent hero/nemesis dynamic opposite T'Challa. Jordan however is excellent as a villain and deserves recognition for this role since his last experience in a Marvel film did NOT work well for him.<br/><br/>The film's CGI was not the best compared to it's predecessors in the MCU especially towards the end. That said, the third act feels completely contrived. As if the film was desiring to reach it's finale much sooner than it needed to be in order possess a natural flow. Not to say that the final battle was not impressive at all or fun to watch but compared to a film like Batman Begins, Black Panther did not have the same final battle between hero and villain vibe that a superhero film should have where the hero after going through much trial rises to the challenge and even then it is not easy for him/her<br/><br/>The best moments of the film were mostly during the first act, with the car chase in South Korea being the show stopper for the film. The rest of the film deserves an average score in this reviewer's opinion. What mostly saved the film were it's talented actors and familiar faces from past popular films and television series. Another positive aspect is how the film took a shift from the MCU's past films that contained excessive humor (Thor Ragnarok, Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man Homecoming). The serious dramatic change gave the film a necessary good feel, however it did contain moments of humor. Black Panther has been called out for having vague similarities with Disney's The Lion King, strangely enough they have some things in common here and there, not to say it is an issue. The fact of the matter is it could have been much more extraordinary had they put more thought to the second and third acts, the weakest moments in the film. Regardless, it was a good addition to the MCU. Up next we have Avengers Infinity War coming soon and it is easy to assume many will be looking forward to placing it above this and many other comic book films released before it. It probably might turn out better than Black Panther. In conclusion, credit where credit's due. This just doesn't feel like the best Marvel has to offer for this year."
"shannen-l-c","4","1","3","25 March 2018"," Extremely overrated and disappointing
","I tagged along with my brother to see Black Panther, and despite Marvel movies generally not being my cup of tea (I find them unimaginative, repetitive and full of cliches), my brother and I had high hopes and expectations of Black Panther. The reason for this is that everybody I knew that had seen it praised it for being one of the best movies they've seen in years and one of the best Marvel movies. I have no idea what those people were watching, but it certainly wasn't the same one I watched. <br/><br/>Black Panther is a sub-par Marvel movie that has only gained such recognition and praise due to the revolutionary predominantly black cast. Putting the cast aside, the movie itself is completely underwhelming. The plot is coma inducing because it's SO boring and there is not nearly enough substance to keep viewers interested for 2 hours. Furthermore, the pacing and development of the plot is here there and everywhere. There seemed to be a complete lack of structure or build-up, and after 40 minutes my brother turned to me and whispered, ""What do you think? I'm really bored,"" which, in my opinion, sums the movie up in one - it's BORING.<br/><br/>All of the characters are one dimensional (a common problem in most Marvel movies) and completely lacking in any personality. The antagonist is your typical vengeful young man hung up on getting revenge by any means necessary, but that suddenly turns into a solemn, soft and pitiful soul at the end. In contrast, the protagonist is your typical hero-type that does nothing to warrant being so important or special apart from being born into the right family. The supporting cast are equally one dimensional and many of them serve no purpose other than to flap over the protagonist. <br/><br/>The CGI was pretty poor with the Wakanda backdrops being obviously green screen. I opted to see the 3D version and felt I'd wasted my money, since the special effects were lacking and the 3D only seemed to serve for decreasing the quality of the picture. <br/><br/>Everything about Black Panther is utterly predictable and lacking in originality. The only thing that sets this movie apart from the other Marvel movies is it's focus on black characters and creation of the fictional nation of Wakanda, and the African culture that goes along with that. Putting that aside, every other Marvel movie I've seen has been better in every way. <br/><br/>If you do opt to see this movie my advice would be don't get your hopes up. Whilst it's certainly not the worst movie in the world, it's also not what the critics praise it as being. If you are a huge Marvel fan, you may find more enjoyment, but in my honest opinion, it is just as unoriginal and boring as the rest of the Marvel movies."
"eduardovargasread","9","1","3","25 March 2018"," Black Panther is Black Power
","Black Power is how I describe this movie. And it's powerful. It brought what was missing in the MCU which was more representation. The universe still lacks of it but this movie brought a good deal of it.
King T'Challa isn't even the best character in the movie, even the villain is better; Killmonger is one of the best, if not the best, villain of all the MCU.
My personal favorite is Shuri, T'Challa's little sister. She represents so much: intellect, cunning, humor and woman power. She is a young lady who commands all the technological side of Wakanda, she brings innovation and modernism into all she does. She is fearless and doesn't mind standing up for her opinions. Her style and personality is fun and young, she is all a young girl should aspire to be. She's a model.
Aside from her, all the others female and male characters bring their own thing to make this movie a masterpiece.
The artistic side of the movie deserves an applause, the costumes, the dances, the architecture of Wakanda, all was so beautiful and reminding of African style with just a touch of futurism. All pure Wakanda style. I wouldn't mind having a dressing like T'Challa's. Especially those old school sandals (WHAT ARE THOSE???).
The soundtrack of this movie is also one of wonder, the beats were just so enjoyable.
I loved this movie, I can't find it a flaw or something I didn't like. I have seen it twice and both were just as fun."

Although Black Panther isn't the best Marvel film of all time after the initial viewing of the this feature it surely is in the top 5 of best Marvel films.

I came to see the Black Panther and Wakanda portrayed on the big screen, not a statement of race.

It is a sad commentary on the world we live in. <br/><br/>It's definetly not the worst marvel film, but not the best either. It is definitely worth a watch."
"micdixon2","6","1","3","22 March 2018"," A fine action film
","This was a completely adequate action film filled with a wonderfully talented cast. I can't help but believe that without the hype (to no fault of the film) and the fact that the moral of the story was beating me over the head from 15 minutes on I would have left the film as enthused as my simple minded friends. Definitely worth the Redbox, but don't bother going to theaters now. I don't typically fancy myself a marvel fan but this ranks at the top of the heap amongst the best of the rest."

","Rich in African culture, packed with relevant themes, dense with fully realised characters, powered by a terrific ensemble, and steered by a talented filmmaker who's only getting better with every subsequent film, Black Panther is enjoyable, entertaining & engaging for the most part, and is a celebration of a heritage that rarely gets a just portrayal on the silver screen.

","I Watched this movie twice because it was so good. I loved the plot, the characters and the jokes. I especially loved Michael B Jordan <3"
"vinodemails","8","1","3","16 March 2018"," Let me list down 5 reasons below, as to why you should still watch this movie.
","Black Panther (2018): Reviee<br/><br/>Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)'s 18th movie, marks the coming of age for the blockbuster churning studios. While the budget of $200 Mn reflects the confidence of the studio to create a solo movie for a not-so-famous Marvel hero, Box office collections (>$ 1bn) show that it has been rewarded nicely for the bet.<br/><br/>Those who follow MCU movies, would know that Black Panther was introduced in Captain America: Civil War where he chases the Captain and Bucky in a thrilling action sequence. This movie follows the story after T'Challa's father dies in the bombing of UN building. The mantle passes on and so the story progresses..<br/><br/>But, you are here for the review, right?<br/><br/>Let me first get out the parts that suck. The plot which is predictable even before the first hint is dropped is a concern - Age old formula of succession, challenger, failure and the comeback (Didn't we see something very similar in Thor's 1st movie?)<br/><br/>Most of the characters are also caricature (a doting mother, feisty girlfriend, priest with a past, betraying friend, loyal general, powerful enemy, the original enemy becoming an ally for honour and the sidekicks).<br/><br/>The underlying narrative about oppression of the black people by colonists and thus the payback; could've been handled much more subtly, than 'in your face' dialogues.<br/><br/>However, this doesn't make the movie unwatchable. Let me list down 5 reasons below, as to why you should still watch this movie.<br/><br/>1. Title credits - Movie starts with tribal beats and the story of Wakanda which is being told by T'Chaka to T'Challa. The visuals made with shape-changing vibranium nanites lend a magical effect and prepare the audience for the VFX that follows. Nicely done!<br/><br/>2. T'Challa, Shuri and Ulysses Klaue - The 3 characters which stand out.<br/><br/>First, the protagonist himself T'Challa (The Black Panther), groomed to be king from a young age himself, he's unusually subdued, for a Superhero. There's no glimpse of any smugness or over-confidence which we saw in Thor. If anything, there's a subtle pride and a bit of self-doubt, which is very well portrayed by Chadwick Boseman. Many scenes which depict his self-depreciation adds to the humour and draw empathy from the audience.<br/><br/>Second, 'Shuri' the young teenage genius to whom the myriad inventions in the whole of Wakanda is attributed to, is solely responsible for bringing in some fun element in the movie. Acting as Q, the doctor and the sidekick, she aces in her role and steals the scene whenever present. Well done, Letitia Wright.<br/><br/>Third and my favourite character in the movie is portrayed by the master Andy Serkis. The man, who rarely gets to play himself as a human is seen enjoying his role as Ulysses so much, that as the audience I was the most disappointed when he died. The raw energy he brings, lights up the screen and he kicks a** even with just 1 hand. Sample this dialogue to his driver 'Play some music. Do you think this is a funeral?', when he's being chased to be killed. He gets ample screen time here (not just a cameo which we saw in Avengers: Age of Ultron)<br/><br/>3. Action sequence - 3 to 4 brilliantly done action sequences, other than the hand to hand combat ones. Special mention to the one shot in South Korea. If only, DC learns something from this!<br/><br/>4. The Dream sequences - They appear thrice. Twice for T'Challa and once for Erik Killmonger. I'm not sure how they do it, but the 'aurora' effect in the sky is just unbelievable. Credit to the VFX team, wherever they may be situated.<br/><br/>5. Africa - the simplicity, the music and nature - The tap and the rhythm, you feel it right from the start. Every time it changes, the mood and the setting changes. Yes, there are few American rock songs in between. But, the director keeps coming back to the simple instruments. They are so very addictive. Africa, showcased through rolling hills, snow-capped mountains, jaw dropping waterfalls and rivers takes us right back to 'The Lion King'. For me, it did bring back few memories from Kenya<br/><br/>So, go ahead and watch this old school, but newly made Action movie. Personally recommended.<br/><br/>P.S. - The IMDB Trivia mentions that the scenes supposed to be in Africa, have in fact, been shot in Georgia. But, ignore that."
"jaielperez","8","1","3","12 March 2018"," Very diferent kind of movie.
","To start one of the reasons this movie was so good to is due to the cast finally being mostly of a race other than white for a blockbuster this is not seen often. Yes the movie had many different directions but that's what made it different. I felt like they were trying to accommodate everyone in this movie which for some viewers made seem confusing. To end i feel this is more mature feel movie than a kids one."
"matthewhoggett","9","1","3","11 March 2018"," The Black Panther Lives!
","Amazing storyline and casting but rather bad CGI toward the end of the Black Panther / Killmonger battle (NOT A SPOILER! - We all knew it would happen!)"
"footballexpert","9","1","3","11 March 2018"," One of the best MCU films yet
","For being a superhero movie, this film could possibly be the breakthrough movie of the year. All of the characters, even the villain, you felt like you could understand where they were coming from. The movie takes place a week or so after the events of Civil War, so T'Challa has to deal with being the Black Panther, as well as being king of Wakanda. One of the biggest plot points in the film is whether or not Wakanda should show the world their tech, as they are more advanced than any other country. So, the Black Panther and his ""crew"" go out and try to stop Klau, who is one of the people who stole their tech. Back to Killmonger. To many people, including myself, this villain could be second or better than the best villain in the MCU, Loki. The reason for this again is of how his father had betrayed Wakanda, and T'Challa's father killed and completely forgot about Erik. This is the spark that adds to his fire, and the main reason he wants to take over Wakanda, which he does, for a little bit. Now, after that bit. The fight scenes in this movie were done very well, especially the car racing scene. But, the last scene was not done as well as I would have hoped. Some of the CGI was off, and was a little weird. 
With that being my only complaint about the movie, Black Panther is one of the best films in the MCU, and I'm really looking forward to what Marvel does with him in Infinity War."
"jhonnyphive","8","1","3","10 March 2018"," Good movie but wish there was less hype
","I ended up watching this a few weeks after it came out so the hype had already come and went. I'm glad I waited because I would've been disappointed after the initial hype train. I ended up really liking the movie anyways, but it wasn't a 10 out of 10. Interesting sci-fi elements and really cool to see something that felt new. I would watch it again in theaters, which for me is the real mark or a good movie."
"xtian_durden","9","1","3","10 March 2018"," A breath of fresh air from Marvel.
","What truly stands out about Black Panther in particular compared to other MCU entries is the large canvas of characters, yet all fully realized with their own goals and convictions. And finally we have a villain who doesn't just show up to terrorize people and blow things up, here, Killmonger's presence is what causes T'Challa to look within himself and realize his weaknesses. It's also a film filled with timely social commentary, a touch of Shakespearean drama, nuanced and charismatic performances from the cast, and an amazing score from Ludwig GÃ¶ransson which featured an overlapping layers of percussion. The only downside of the film is the climactic sequence in Wakanda's dark underground vibranium mine."
"tsfms","8","1","3","10 March 2018"," Changing Trends in MCU
","As someone watching Marvel's movies ever since the first Ironman, guess I have some qualification of critising the whole franchise. 
I've been disliking the direction Disney choose for Civil War and the following titles, which mostly put ""fun"" upon telling a story about ""hero"" or just making a proper movie. Black Panther surprisingly shows some difference. The whole movie is trying to be not-so-""funny"". Instead, they treat the character seriously, build the jorney and the character's arc convincingly, and made several reflection on contemporary issues. 
Surely there are ""Marvel issues"" remaining. The music repeatedly jumps from unique and interesting style back to lame and formatic orchestra. Several scenes' cinematography remain lack of contrast (but mostly good job for Rachel Morrison! much better than the disastrous Thor 3). And the dialogues are definately childish compared to the issues they try to dicuss about. But in all, this is a bright changes for Marvel's Cinematic Universe. 
Seen the Infinity War trailer, you can tell this new style is continuing (especially considering the whole trailer has no silly jokes!). Good decision this time, Disney!"

"schumacheranthony","7","1","3","6 March 2018"," Don't freak out, I don't hate it
","I think the movie is fine. Surprisingly, the score fits with the scenes better that I ever thought a score with that much snare drum could. I like the look of the interior scenes, everything outside looks fake as hell. The tech feels fresh, and kinda interesting, which is hard to do after this many years of superhero movies. The action is fun sometimes, though I could do without the bad CGI. Overall, its a fine marvel movie. And don't say marvel took a daring risk when they made this, this was clearly a calculated move to get everyone with a specific political opinion into the theater. Its not like they didn't know that the controversy would generate box office sales. Its a fine movie. Enda story."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","3","4 March 2018"," Coogler helps Marvel set ""Black Panther"" apart, even in its so-so moments
","Since it was announced, ""Black Panther"" has held the promise of something different from Marvel Studios. It's been 10 years since the Marvel journey began with ""Iron Man"" and the narratives, spectacles and formula are in perpetual danger of wearing thin. Co-written and directed by Ryan Coogler (""Creed,"" ""Fruitvale Station""), ""Black Panther"" writes its own narrative into the tapestry of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a thread that is both distinctive and familiar.<br/><br/>""Black Panther"" has a lot in common with ""Thor"" with its hidden fantasy world and elements of near-Shakespearean palace intrigue, but most of the action takes place in the fictional African kingdom of Wakanda instead of out of it, making the film Marvel's biggest exercise in world-building to date. Coogler must foremost create a people, culture and society that we believe in and care about in as little time as possible. With production designer Hannah Beachler (""Moonlight,"" ""Creed"") and costume designer Ruth Carter (""Selma""), they create a colorful, vibrant and exciting Wakanda. No fictional place has seemed more appealing to spend time in since the ""Avatar"" world of Pandora.<br/><br/>Yet that's purely the sci-fi/fantasy appeal of ""Black Panther,"" which really makes its mark with themes and narratives of extreme relevance, especially presented through this black lens. The film opens with a prologue in Coogler's native Oakland, tying the modern day black experience to the Afro-Futurist fantasy experience of Wakanda, a nation of smart, strong black people sitting on top of a ""gold mine"" of vibranium, the greatest source of power known to man. <br/><br/>The film mostly focuses on how T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), newly minted king of Wakanda and also its guardian and protector, the Black Panther, wrestles with having leadership thrust upon him. At the same time, the secrecy and isolationist policy long held by his country faces new pressure and danger from the outside world from arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and mercenary Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan). <br/><br/>The story surrounds T'Challa with a team of strong minds and bodies (and terrific talents) including ex-girlfriend Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), tech-savvy sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), and Wakandan General Okoye (Danai Gurira). There's also CIA Agent Everett Ross (Martin Freeman), who is a fifth as interesting as any of those characters and actually does amount to the token white guy. Outside of the superhero team-up films, it's Marvel's best ensemble.<br/><br/>Yet perhaps all of them - even T'Challa - are overshadowed by Jordan's Killmonger, whose fascinating backstory and motivation make him Marvel's greatest villain success, or at least in that first tier with Tom Hiddleston's Loki and Michael Keaton's Vulture from 2017's ""Spider-Man: Homecoming."" A villain with conviction and not just some unstoppable force trying to destroy the world, Killmonger makes ""Black Panther"" much more dramatic and interesting start to finish. He and T'Challa clash in personality and ideology in a satisfying way, one that's somewhat akin to Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. <br/><br/>The film offers a buffet of action styles, from a ""James Bond""-inspired sequence in a Korean casino to a medieval fantasy battlefield brawl to the one-on-one fight scenes that echo some of Coogler's work in ""Creed."" It's a little all over the place and some sequences therefore work better than others. What's more important is most of the time, the stakes feel relevant even when the action gets messy.<br/><br/>Carefully considered characters and themes, however, should account for most of ""Black Panther's"" success. That's how Coogler elevated ""Creed"" from among all the ""Rocky"" sequels and similar cliche-ridden boxing films. Creed's struggle was deeply personal and human. Nearly every character gets that same treatment here. <br/><br/>Thematically, Coogler and Joe Robert Cole do not shy away from relevant black issues, even though the film explores them through fantasy rather than harsh reality. The Afro-Futurist fantasy of a powerful and influential black nation brings with it questions of responsibility that the movie devotes itself to contemplating and addressing. T'Challa must not only decide what kind of leader he wants to become, but reckon with the realities of a changing world. <br/><br/>""Black Panther"" triumphs not exclusively as an inspiration to black people wrestling with these same questions, but all of us can consider the fantasy of power and position and how we would use it. These notions distinguish the film from the rest of the Marvel Studios canon, not necessarily the more tangible storytelling and filmmaking elements. The film has weaknesses, many that it shares with other Marvel superhero movies, but those films cannot match its intellectual acuity and social consciousness.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"skapade2","8","1","3","25 February 2018"," All The Stars are Closer - Black Panther Review
","Black lives matter on that note the all-new Marvels Cinematic standalone movie came and hit each every record across the globe, with a cast of more than 90% African-American actors this movie stunned entire critics and audiences and proved that there is no supremacy when there is an art to represent, all-new standalone movie was a real piece of art which beautifully represents the entire African culture and colors.
It has taken a decade i.e. 18 movies all the start from Iron Man (2008) - some movies were good and some were average, it really gives an idea that how big road was that for thousands of people who made this journey spectacularly amazing and fun and yet still the Marvels Studios are continuously giving us that amaze face, but now with that all experience the expectations are also increased and I am sure Black Panther certainly proved that they are still the best when it comes to making superhero movie. 
Balck Panther is a film that tells us that as to embrace the future you need to respect that past. So it all begins with a Wakanda, a fictional African nation that was hidden away from the rest of the world due to their rich resource of ""Vibranium "" a meteor that hit Wakanda centuries ago.
It is the home of prince T'Challa who recently faced a tragedy as the King of Wakanda i.e T'Challa's father was murdered in Berlin during Captain America: Civil War movie, the film rightly set after the events of Captain America. And now T'Challa must return to Wakanda to take over the throne and become the rightful heir. This movie is all about the futuristic technology of Wakanda that how they embrace the Vibranium into the day to day life. 
Black Panther was not even a superhero movie for entire one hour. like the other Marvel Standalone movies, for example, Ant-Man or Doctor Strange were concentrated towards a single role or character, but with Black Panther, it was totally different the characters like Nakia, Okoye, Shuri, and Everett Ross shared equally good performance especially Okoye leader of Dora Milaje (special bodyguards of King) and rightfully like other viewers I also demand separate movie or series exclusively for ""Dora Milaje"". So it was basically a group performance which converts simple superhero movie into something special. Some quick cuts between separate scenes were making the film fragile and thus it was taking a time to grasp, only that was the little disappointment in the entire movie. But when it comes to positive note some scenes like the car chase in South Korea, battle scenes of Dora Milage with other tribes were certainly impressive but not impressive as Iron Man 2 Formula one scene or Captain America taking down entire Hydra agents with his shield and fist. But still, the action sequences were really fun to watch.
Like Captain America: Civil War Black Panther was also geopolitical thriller action Movie but more than that it was wonderful CGI movie, loaded with great waterfalls, landscapes, cities and yes huge Rhinoceros also plus they also kept the beautiful African culture intact by adding traditional African tribal background music and the special credit goes to Kendrick Lamar for giving entire music.
The core division of movie was divided into two different thoughts of Black community one was to keep their world safe from the outsiders and another was to fight with clash of cultures, two different homes and burden of their ancestors as to give the proof of their powerful existence, which gives us the thought that the intentions of villain Erick Killmonger were not so wrong as he wants to uprise his community like every villain is the hero of his story.
And thus it's compulsory to talk about ""The Villains"" in this movie like the other Marvels movies villain were practically a joke but in this movie, there were two powerful villains i.e. Ulysses Klaus (Andy Serkis) and Erick Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) and both were super badass correct that's the right word of description for the first half Ulysses Klaus (Andy Serkis) totally stole the show it was like that I was watching Heath Ledger but the face was of Andy Serkis and then Erick Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) a proud, muscular, and challenging fighter a right match for Black Panther and that's one of the main reasons why this movie is so special.
And yes if you are die-hard Marvels fan you know you have to wait until the multiplex employees start to stare at you. Know what I mean...!!! 
 Really It was a treat to watch though it was not 100% perfect still beautifully represented a must watch.

"mnogueirafacebook","6","1","3","25 February 2018"," Wonder Woman is still the best superhero film ever made
","This is your typical Marvel film, which is not a bad thing in itself. It has top level special effects, great action sequences, gorgeous settings and costumes. What it doesn't have is a very good storyline - it's totaly predictable and rather weak. This film also suffers - as usual in Marvel films - from the villain deficiency sindrome: the villian is simply too weak and totaly uninteresting.
As for the actors, they're all good and obiously capable of much more, but they all did what was asked of them flawlessly. But none of them will win any awards for this film, and that's the truth. Chadwick Boseman makes a competent hero, though not a very memorable one. Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong'o stand out as two very strong and gorgeous women (I think I'm a little in love with Lupita Nyong'o, she's one of the most beautifull women I've ever seen and an extraordinary actress). Andy Serkis is awsome, as always. Michael B. Jordan stands out for the negative, as possibly one of the worst and dullest villains in movie history.
All in all, your average Marvel film, with all it's strengths and faults. Honestly, with all the hype surrounding this film, I was expecting a lot more. Wonder Woman stands untouched as the best superhero film ever made."
"MackMonMay87","8","1","3","25 February 2018"," Marvel's Trip to Wakanda is an Outstanding Ride
","Clocking in as the 18th Marvel Cinematic Universe movie to date, Black Panther directed by Ryan Coogler and starring Chadwick Boseman might make some moviegoers wonder that in a series this widespread and ongoing, how could the magic still be there? I feel that the key to Marvel's success is in offering what you expect in a superhero movie: amazing visuals, great characters, thrilling action and storylines, but also something unexpected.<br/><br/> Each of Marvel's huge successes takes the standard superhero story and merges it with another genre or style: Captain America was a World War 2 superhero film, its sequel was a spy/espionage-flavored hero flick, Spider-Man: Homecoming was a teen coming-of-age story with superheroics, Ant Man was a goofy heist comedy with heroics, Thor and Dr.Strange are fantasy mixed with the superhero mantle, etc. It gives each of the characters their own vibe, flavor, and niche they represent, and this even extends to the Netflix material. You never feel like you're watching more of the same even though the MCU and related material now spans hundreds of hours of content. <br/><br/> Black Panther carries on the this tradition by merging the superhero genre with a royalty-themed drama. Michael B. Jordan who plays the film's main villain, called it ""Marvel's Game of Thrones"" in an interview, and you can see why after watching. Black Panther also has themes of how to balance power on a worldwide scale, and how national superpowers can interact with other countries, if they should at all. 
If that all sounds like maybe it's not quite what you expected, or maybe a bit too political and not action packed enough, do a 180 and think again: Black Panther has all that great content packed up with absolutely beautiful visuals and kick ass action that bring the fictional nation of Wakanda to life. <br/><br/> Unlike something like Spider-Man or Daredevil, most of Black Panther's stories don't take place in anything close to modern American/first world life, so on top of introducing characters, crafting a story, and bringing it to a balanced and satisfying conclusion, the movie also had to introduce non-comic reading (the majority) audiences with what kind of nation Wakanda is, its history and culture, and what makes it so powerful. The movie manages to give you all this information on how Wakanda figures into the rest of the MCU and why we're only just now hearing about them in the story (although there were little hints at it earlier, aside from Age of Ultron, watch Iron Man 2 again!), and make that not just background information about the movie's setting, but an important part of the plot. T'Challa has to decide whether to keep Wakanda and it's technological marvels hidden from the rest of the world, or use his power and influence to help other countries in need, even if it risks invasion. <br/><br/> Marvel fans saw accomplished stage and film actor Chadwick Boseman play Prince T'Challa before in the excellent Civil War, so we already knew going in even from that performance that he'd deliver bigtime, and you get more of the same measured, wise, skilled, but occasionally fun-loving character we already saw. Helping him out is a great supporting cast including Danai Gurira (popular from The Walking Dead) as General Okoye, Forest Whitaker as royal advisor Zuri, a hilarious, smart mouthed and trolling-heavy performance from Letitia Wright as Shuri, T'Challa's sister, and Golem performer Andy Serkis as the villainous arms dealer Klaw, and Michael B. Jordan as the villainous Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens, amongst other great cast members that contribute to a story that brings the classic Black Panther stories written by Jack Kirby, Christopher Priest, and others to life. You could tell all of the cast and crew had passion for the project and wanted to deliver something memorable. <br/><br/> Speaking of the cast and story, it's the story of the villain, Killmonger, that really made this stand out for me. I was already excited and aboard the hype-train for sure, but was prepared for reality in case the movie let me down. Marvel has been criticized for its villains before, and how they don't measure up to other great film villains, but in several past installments, we've had villains with strong motivations, and between Vulture and Killmonger, we've seen some of this decade's best villains in comic book movies yet. Some critics are even going so far to say that Killmonger is on the level of Heath Ledger's Joker, and I have to say, his character nearly steals the movie with his well constructed backstory and well-developed motivations. Before he does something particularly heinous, you might even find yourself almost rooting for him after you find out why he's doing what he's doing. <br/><br/> The soundtrack to the film also has its own identity, with typical orchestral instruments being swapped out for African influenced instruments that were studied and recorded in their home environment by Ludwig Goranson, the composer. Royal trumpets and pounding drums accompany T'Challa when he starts laying down the might of the Panther on fools, a sharp female-led chant backs up General Okoye when she starts flinging her spear, and whenever Killmonger shows up, due to his American upbringing, you get a threatening, pounding orchestral hip-hop beat that is in my opinion good enough to be sampled by a major artist (speaking of major artists, Kendrick Lamar's original tracks he contributes to the soundtrack also help jazz up a few sequences and the end credits). 
 Along the same line, the costumes and design of Wakanda transport you to a world as rich as any fantasy movie, or any of the other incredible locations in the now wide Marvel Cinematic Universe. <br/><br/> With stunning visuals, fantastic action, and an ending that really makes you understand what T'Challa is about and what sets him and Wakanda apart from other superhero material, I think Black Panther is towards the top of MCU films. The one major criticism I can give it is going to be a spoiler, so please, if you haven't seen it yet, consider the review done, and go enjoy the movie. If not, scroll lower, and read my comments.<br/><br/> The one change I would've made to Black Panther would be to save both of its main villains for future installments, much in the same way Loki from the Thor films has crossed over into other properties and hung around for a while now in the MCU, or how Wilson Fisk is still a factor in the Netflix shows. 
 Marvel has to acknowledge its good villain problem, and they did too good of a job crafting Killmonger, and to a lesser extent Klaw, who was still funny and interesting as well, to just kill them both off in their first outing. Killmonger uses Klaw's body as a token to enter Wakanda, but what if he faked his death and then revived Klaw, forcing Panther to fight them both in the end? That might've been interesting, and then have them both jailed to see justice for their crimes, so that they can be used in the series again. Both of them, but especially Killmonger, are such rich characters that it almost felt like a shame to cut them out of the franchise so soon. But that's how it goes, and as is, their deaths serve the story and are memorable."

Jordan.I'm understand where he's coming from and how it lead him to become the man right now so when he died it actually very touching and I think if the MCU need a main villain specific for the world of Black Panther like Loki to Thor or Red Skull to Cap. Erik Killmonger is the one for sure"
"zacwhyte","8","1","3","23 February 2018"," Somehow Overwhelmed
","First would like to note that I rarely leave reviews, but seriously felt that I had to with this one.<br/><br/>First off I went into the cinema only a week late from my original planned date to watch what was undoubtedly (personally) my most anticipated flick of 2018; within which time I had heard a lot of different and also divided reviews from separate people. I had eventually settled on the suggestion that you'll enjoy the movie more, or less, depending on how much the character of 'Black Panther' and setting in the fascinating fictional city of 'Wakanda' appeal to you prior to your first viewing of the movie. I was comfortable with this as, being a massive fan of Marvel comics, I reassured the certainty that T'Challa is my favourite superhero of all time. Because of this it is easy to say that I may very well be biased to the character, however I entered my screening of Black Panther with fairly mediocre expectations of the movie after what I had heard, and it is safe to say that I was absolutely mind blown.<br/><br/>The score, to begin with, is very fitting to the setting which really immerses you into the story. It had an African theme to it, which suits the movie being set near to Kenya and Ethiopia, accompanied by a classic MCU soundtrack to satisfy the whole sci-fi and comic-book action side of it. Unfortunately Toto's ""Africa"" was not featured, however I did love the end credits tune 'All The Stars' by Kendrick Lamar and SZA which easily connected to the whole Oakland setting and perspective of Erik Killmonger (who is safely now my favourite MCU villain). Killmonger totally kicked ass and stole the show for me, and I adored the tie-in with him being the cousin of T'Challa (Black Panther) himself.<br/><br/>The CGI and special effects were fantastic and clearly had a lot of effort put into them, akin with the stunts performed throughout the movie; all of which packed a punch with certain scenes that seriously took my breath away. Shuri is such a sweetheart and is easily my favourite character, having some of the funniest scenes in the entire flick and the storyline really is fantastic and very true to the Black Panther comics.<br/><br/>Moreover, the ending of the movie genuinely brought a tear to my eye; something which not many TV Shows or movies have done before. I realized upon Black Panther's sacrifice of his own cousin, Erik Killmonger, he was reflecting upon his fathers advice that ""it is hard for a good man to be king"". This tied in beautifully with the way T'Chaka killed Erik's father in the prologue; but I also loved T'Challa's sense of forgiveness towards Erik upon taking him to witness the sunsets of Wakanda, in order to fulfill his dream created by his father, as the last image he saw before he died. In that scene where T'Challa and Erik sit together and watch the sunset, it was easy to identify the sense of family between them, which I like to think they felt themselves, as cousins, too.<br/><br/>I am easily going to give Black Panther a 9/10, making it my highest ranked Marvel movie ever. You should definitely spend some money on watching this movie, especially if you are a fan of the Marvel universe, and more in particular, Black Panther as a character."

","Just as you were getting bored of superhero movies, this comes along with its originality, humor and engaging story. This is an amazing family film with pace and interesting characters. It is fine for young kids, say from around 10 years old, and also fun for adults.<br/><br/>The story is one of a King leading his people through the challenges of connecting with a wider world, and dealing with internal conflict and turmoil. At its heart it is a condemnation of hatred.<br/><br/>One thing I liked is the movie had lots of humor and light moments. The film maker made the right choice by not being too edgy or ""dark"". The female actors played strong characters pivotal to the story, and Letitia Wright was a particular stand-out. The action and special effects where on point, and music and sound design especially good. A visual feast, and a must-see."

","Chadwick Boseman plays the Black Panther, the new king of Wakanda - a mantle that has befallen him because of the recent death of his father, which we saw in Civil War.<br/><br/>A running theme throughout this film is whether T'challa (The Black Panther) is ready and fit to take the throne. Chadwick's T'challa is a sweet, undemanding, respectful king. Almost boyish in his portrayal and you can understand why his people just WANT to protect him and be loyal to him. He's a good man, and as his dead father says, ""it's hard for a good man to be king"". <br/><br/>T'challa, like almost every other character in this film, has a STRONG defining characteristic, and they have to deal with the flaw of that characteristic at some point during the film. For T'challa, his goodness is both his strength and his flaw.<br/><br/>I read some of the reviews saying T'challa is a weak king. Well, those who say that have missed the point entirely. T'challa is not weak. He rules his people with strength but also has the RESPECT for others and his people to allow them to be strong along with him and voice their opinions. And some of those people he has respect for are the Dora Milaje and his sister, Shuri.<br/><br/>The Dora Milaje is an all female army led by the general, Okoye (played by Danai Gurira). They are one of the greatest things about this movie. The Dora Milaje's sole mission is to protect Wakanda and the king of Wakanda, whoever that king may be. So Okoye is led by duty. And her sense of duty is strong and VERY admirable. The struggle and flaw of her character comes when the villain, Killmonger, takes the throne. As Dora Milaje, she has to serve the new king, even though she doesn't believe in him. And the portrayal and emotion Danai Gurira gives during these climactic scenes (and throughout the rest of the movie to be honest) is gold.<br/><br/>Shuri, T'challa's little sister, is a technological genius and brings a lot of the comedy of the film. Her and T'challa's bond is evident, and it's one of the greatest relationships in the movie."

","Black Panther is the story of a country far far away called Wakanda.. A futuristic country where its rare mineral Vibranium has been mined for thousands of years and holds immense power, both for building armor, weapons, healing and for other technologies as well. This metal has the ability to solve alot of problems on Earth... <br/><br/>The rulers of Wakanda, a powerful monarchy, where the king is granted super powers and technology such as the Black Panther suit, are set out to help other nations recover from problems they are facing.. However, there is a threat to their country, as evil people want to get their hands on the rare metal known as Vibranium, as well as take over control of the monarchy. <br/><br/>The story is set between Wakanda and America, but also ventures into Korea as well. The main character T'challa holds Kingship in Wakanda, and thus is granted powers as the Black Panther. His father and uncle both died for the cause (to keep Wakanda's legacy and help solve the worlds problems). T'challa's morality and mission is threatened by the antagonist who has a different plan for Wakanda, after living through the hardships faced by African Americans in the United States. The antagonist envies yet also craves what the Wakandans have, power, technology, and sovereignty.<br/><br/>Overall, the action and spectacle is an 8/10. The plot doesn't go to deep into T'Challa's past, and leaves some unanswered questions about him and the nation that is Wakanda, but besides that the story is a solid 6/10. The characters are what really shine in this movie, as well as the message that you are left with at the end.<br/><br/>A great watch for 2018!"

","The latest Marvel comic-book inspired blockbuster did live up to the inevitable hype despite the wafer-thin storyline. It is a superhero film and therefore should be judged on this merit. The acting performances were all very solid despite the perceived weakness of the plot. The highlights were the comic one-liners delivered expertly by Shuri (Letitia Wright) and M'Baku (Winston Duke) which were peppered delightfully throughout 2h 14 min feature. This film should be normal but it isn't. Therefore, you cannot underestimate the symbolism of having a predominately black cast doing what action heroes do on the big screen. It was a great sight to see. Hopefully, this provides the platform for some of the film's stars to get some more leading roles."
"BloodOfTheEnemy","8","1","3","21 February 2018"," Enjoyable despite weaknesses in the writing
","As others have said, the movie suffers from weaknesses in the writing and and an under-ambitious plot, but the imaginative depiction of Wakanda, combined with Chadwick Boseman's charisma in the lead makes the whole thing pretty enjoyable all the same. Overall, I liked Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War, liked him throughout this movie, and came out of the theater looking forward to seeing more of the character in Infinity Wars.<br/><br/>My main gripe would be that the conflict motivation in the story is highly under-used. The premise is pretty interesting, that Black Panther's home country of Wakanda is as big a technological power as Asgaard, but has been concealing this throughout history and likewise has been remaining neutral in world conflicts, even though their technology could have been a powerful force, for example, against black oppression throughout the ages. <br/><br/>It takes very little imagination to see the widespread political outrage that this could cause if it leaked out, with potentially thousands of people and powerful radical enemy organizations trying to take control of that technology from T'Challa. Instead, the writers decided to limit the antagonistic forces to basically just one disgruntled guy. As a result, the movie comes off as a bit of a knock-off of the first Thor movie, except that here it's Killmonger instead of Loki who threatens a one-man coup of the kingdom. <br/><br/>Anyway, still enjoyable, as I said, but I will always regret what the movie could have been"

Black Panther: 6.9/10 (good movie)<br/><br/>I was very excited to watch this movie, and because of the reviews I read and heard, I expected very much of this movie. While watching the movie, I kept waiting for it to get better and be more thrilling. I can tell you, judging from a technical and qualitative prospective, it wasn't so good, it was just good. It could have been much better, when you compare it to other superheroes movies, it lacks some important elements.<br/><br/>But noticing the values and meanings, which you can't miss because they are focused on, you probably will change your mind about the movie in my opinion. It tells you about how dark and terrible the world we live in is, and that it's our responsibility to make this world a better place, to use what God gave us to help ourselves and others who can't help themselves against the evil they face, and not sit and live in peace where many others die and can't live properly throughout the world. And it talks about racism just by a black man being the hero, and how modern and developed they can be.<br/><br/>And that's why it's different than other movies, its inspiration makes it outstanding, and we indeed need more movies to talk about such problems."
"lowlander-38367","7","1","3","20 February 2018"," In the higher echelons of the MCU
","Sit through the first half hour and you are duly rewarded. There's a lot about the MCU from a scriptwriting standpoint I couldn't stand, but this and Ragnarok prove that we are thankfully far away from the days of Iron Man 2 and Captain America 1. Black Panther is so much more thematically dense, rich and driving that many others in the franchise, and unlike Ragnarok, the emotional conflict drives the core physical conflict that is the cause of all the explosive action scenes. The film does not shy away from the obvious political bent; the dying lines of the villain lean so hard into the theme of oppression vs. the potential/imperative to improve upon it that I almost can't believe the soulless heads driving the Marvel project let them get away with it.<br/><br/>But you have to make it to the Forest Whitaker exposition scene around the midpoint. Until then, Black Panther doesn't feel like it has much of a story. The first act is all set-up with one action scene and not a particularly great one at that, and with only three more big setpieces to follow it doesn't actually get to show off the Black Panther toolkit much at all, even with all the Chekhov's Guns going off in just the right places. So while I think this is one of the best Marvel movies from an artistic standpoint, there are others, like both Guardians and Ragnarok, that are better paced, better delivered movies."

","Many reviews here are stating this and that about Black panther and digging deep, while on the surface Black Panther is as good as any good superhero movie. The cinematography is brilliant, followed by a strong sense of commitment by the actors to their characters, backed up by amazing visual effects and visuals.<br/><br/>It is a typical marvel movie,that sets off on a high note and followed by a strong second half. Micheal B Jordan produced yet another charismatic performance as killmonger. Chadwick Bosnan's performance was stiff throughout. Most of his jokes were just cringey and his dialogue delivery was just awful. The plus points to this film include the extra bit of effort put by the costume designers to make everything authentic as hell. Any one would be completely mesmerized by the visuals Black panther has brought on screen, making it one of the best looking Marvel movies to date. Killmonger was yet again a sensible villain. We feel that he has the reason to get his throne and this in turn pushes T'Challa to see into himself and undo the wrong. Black Panther works as a good superhero flick, but marketing it as a movement is just plain absurdity. The film so blatantly imposes that without vibranium, Wakanda and its sprawling civilization would be nothing and would cease to exist. It also has a predictable story and a kind of a forgettable ending. Killmonger deserved more screentime, in comparison to T'Challa. <br/><br/>If you're looking for some insane action or some adrenaline rush, Black panther is not for you. It slowly works itself, with some noticeable flaws and mistakes."
"shadowghost-90604","7","1","3","18 February 2018"," Entertaining and fun, but not the best.
","Let me start off and say that this film is aesthetically pleasing. The visuals of 
Wakanda are amazing, along with the the costume designs and cinematography. For the most part, the CGI was decent, but in some parts it looked very fake. At times you could tell that the characters were in front of a green screen. 
Now onto the acting, I have to say that all the actors and actresses did a fantastic job. Chadwick Boseman nailed it as the king of Wakanda, along with his friends. All the characters were diverse and unique. Shuri, played by Letitia Wright, was probably my favorite character in the movie, as she ailed it as a smart teenager. 
The villains of the movie, Kilmonger and Ulysses Klaue, were fantastic as well. I felt that they shouldn't have killed off Klaue, as his performance was amazing and it would've been cool to see him in other MCU films. Kilmonger was good too, but I felt that he was trying to act ""too tough"" at times, when he was already intimidating.
Now let me say that they did an excellent job on depicting the Wakandan culture. This seperates this movie from many other MCU films and makes it unique. 
Now I must talk about the ""BAD THINGS"".
<ul><li>The pacing was off. It started out action packed and then it was slow, then it was action packed again</li></ul>-The CGI and green screen were very noticeable at times and in some scenes the CGI looks unfinished, like in the last fight between Kilmonger and T'challa. They looked like clay in that scene<br/><br/>SHOULD YOU WATCH IT?
Overall, Black Panther was a decent MCU film. It could've been better with a few tweaks and changes, but it was still fun to watch. You should go watch it. as it is very entertaining. If I were to rank this in a list of TOP 10 Marvel movies, I would put this one as the 7th. NOW GO BUY YOUR TICKETS!!!!"

","Have to admit this is the first Marvel Movie in a very long time where I didn't enjoy the plot. It's highly derivitive and largely unimaginative. The middle section rambles and the plot twists are poor and predictable.<br/><br/>But what Black Panther has going for it is an interesting setting and an exceptional cast. Wakanda is excellently realised. Everyone has a chance to shine. Chadwick Boseman builds well on his excellent showing in Civil War, Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Guria are engaging and very impressive. <br/><br/>But there are two big problems for me. Andy Serkis, who chews the scenery marvellously, is killed off far too soon, replaced by Michael B. Jordan's less interesting Killmonger as the main villian, and we have the old utterly predicatable trope where the main hero is believed dead for a strectch during the movie's second half. This is tired. Is anyone fooled by this? I'm also far from convinced that having Wakanda shut off for centuries from the rest of the world was the way to go. It actually made the country look hypocritical.<br/><br/>But as I say, the acting saves it. This would have been a barely passable six out of ten but for the excellent cast. Winston Duke's M'Baku is an added bonus. He was fantastic and I hope he gets more screen time in future movies. He has the film's best gag, too."

","I donÂ´t think this movie is bad at all. But I had a real problem even talking about this film with others since it seems like they completely reject any flaw the movie has. While it is true that you should enjoy the movie I do not think you should turn your eye away from weaker points.<br/><br/>I had no problem with the cast in this movie and I think they worked great. The problem is that this film tries to be original while still following the marvel formula and that shows. Certain Characters does sometimes feel unique but at other times they just feel like the other supporting casts in the Marvel cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>This also is shown in the plot. I really liked to experience wakanda and its culture but the movie jumped from that to generic action/superhero stuff and then back to the world of wakanda. And thus I felt like I had not seen enought. You barely see how the city of Wakanda looks except from above shots.<br/><br/>The major flaw I had was the ending that did not look good at all. Since the Black panther suit is all cgi I understand that it can look fake but even the movements looked somewhat weird and unnatural. While Civil war also had Cgi, I think its effects were a lot more polished. And this exists in more parts of the film, not just the ending.<br/><br/>I did not hate this movie. I quite liked liked it. But I am dissapointed that it did not focus on the elements that actually made the movie good and instead felt like it had to add elements to make it feel like another superhero movie.<br/><br/>You can like this movie but do not be afraid to point out its flaw. More time polishing the effects could help and I had really hoped that they would try to make this movie feel a lot more unique."
"bastille-852-731547","7","1","3","16 February 2018"," An Entertaining, Unique Marvel Film
","The highly anticipated superhero film ""Black Panther"" is finally here, after a ton of hype and outstanding reviews. While I would say that the film very, very slightly does not quite live up to some of the hype, it is still well-made and thoroughly entertaining. The film's acting is stronger than one would come across in most superhero movies, highlighted by Chadwick Boseman's commanding and stylish performance as T'Challa (Black Panther.) Also noteworthy is Michael B. Jordan's role as the impressively complex villain, and the Dora Milaje--the all-female special forces unit of Wakanda (the fictional African country where much of the film takes place.)<br/><br/>Speaking of Wakanda, director Ryan Coogler has masterfully designed and executed difficult world-building tactics to create this kingdom. The visual effects on display depicting Wakanda's unique landscapes are stunning, and it is genuinely impressive the detail that went into analyzing the kingdom's mercantile economy and political structure. Through depiction of a spear-fighting ritual as well as music, dance and food, audiences are immersed into the nation's local culture as well. These elements often make ""Black Panther"" feel more fresh than the typical superhero film.<br/><br/>While there's undoubtedly much to like about ""Black Panther,"" the film does unfortunately contain some notable lapses. Its biggest flaw is that the climax of the movie is incredibly rushed and sometimes feels like it has trouble taking its time to tie up loose ends and plot holes. Conversely, the first act seems a bit too long. While the movie is generally well-written, the film's attempted moments of comic relief and one-liners that are effective in other Marvel movies tend to fall a bit flat here. That said, this is still a good and unique superhero film that I do recommend. 7/10<br/><br/>Note: I saw the film in IMAX. The film's frequent use (over an hour of footage worth) of special formatting for IMAX, as well as the screen size and sound system, made this premium experience worthwhile."

No. It's basically what you would expect from a marvel movie. It's bit different of course, with the setting and the fact that almost the entire cast is black. But besides the cast, this really is not something we haven't seen before.

"JohnnyWeissmuller","9","5","37","13 February 2018"," Black Panther: Fight The Power!
","Marvel's latest entry in their ever-expanding cinematic universe follows directly after Captain America: Civil War, with Chadwick Boseman's Prince T'Challa, a.k.a., Black Panther, preparing to take the throne of Wakanda after his father's tragic death. <br/><br/>Written and directed by Ryan Coogler (and Joe Robert Cole), who is on a real hot streak after Fruitvale Station and Creed, Black Panther is the first superhero/comic book movie to feature a black lead since the Blade series (1998, 2002 & 2004), but more than that, this is a distinctively African story with a predominantly black cast. Something that's equally unique for a franchise film and a tentpole movie that's leading into Avengers: Infinity War. <br/><br/>Whether Black Panther will prove to be significant enough to encourage more faith in diverse casts within the industry and audiences at large is yet to be seen, but I've every confidence that this will be a very popular and successful film. And it deserves to be. Black Panther is really terrific. <br/><br/>Importantly, to some degree, Black Panther also works as a stand-alone film, being quite self-contained despite being part of a bigger world. Much like Wakanda, which is almost akin to an African Brigadoon; a place hidden in the jungle, unknown to outsiders, unseen, but magical within. This Utopia has been built on a rare metal that is more technologically advanced than anything else on earth, whilst a certain plant unique to the land is key to the royal bloodline and the power of Black Panther. <br/><br/>This is a beautifully realised film, with a real cultural sensibility with a true identity established for Wakanda and its inhabitants. Every scene is brought vividly to life, from tribal rituals on the top of a waterfall to a city infrastructure, throne rooms and tech centres, and a nice diversion to Busan, where one of the film's villains, Andy Serkis' Klaue is being pursued. <br/><br/>What's also evident is the enjoyment and commitment a truly excellent cast displays throughout. From Boseman, who plays T'Challa as an intelligent, sensitive, proud man, to a fierce Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyonga on assertive form, and a sparkling performance from Letitia Wright, who, is both T'Challa's sister and a Q-like master of arms and tech specialist. <br/><br/>With palace intrigue abound, Black Panther finds ways to make T'Challa truly reflect his culture, which goes some way to counterbalance some of the typical - perhaps even expected - superhero movie tropes; absent fathers, flying machines, special costumes and a major battle at the climax. With the battle in question finding a different approach to the city under siege narrative that's been overdone in terms of mass destruction. <br/><br/>There's strong support from Martin Freeman, Forest Whitaker, Daniel Kaluuya, and Angela Bassett. Distinctive costume design, great music and a fine score. Plus well-paced moments of humour in a film that's smart, self-aware, ambitious enough to be individual within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and a real pleasure from start to finish."

Some want to help the world, some want to stay isolated and the last group wants to helps blacks to essentially kill off whites (and any race really) so they (blacks) can rule over the world. So yes, there is a group that is racist. But again, they are bad guys. The others are not like that. As that is how good vs bad works. Bad guys have bad views. <br/><br/>There are some jokes like when they call the one white guy ""Colonizer"" and what not. But not sure how that can be taken as offensive given the fact the guy is british (not that we americans are any better) and did alot of bad things with blacks in the past. <br/><br/>But in the end (spoiler) Black Panther (the king) decides the world is suffering to much and they need to open Wakanda up so their tech can be shared around the world. It would solve so many issues worldwide. Even in the mid-credits scene he speaks before the U.N. about we are all one (humans) and everyone should share in the good of what Wakanda has to offer. Which is the opposite of racism! <br/><br/>*************Review itself***************
Overall the movie did seem a bit different then most Marvel movies given you mostly are in Wakanda. The CGI wasn't to bad. Though the city felt a little weird even though its explained as being advanced tech from a vibranium meteor crash long ago. Some of the tech that is used seems REALLY crazy advanced to the point of it almost doesn't make sense for being earth since until this time we haven't seen such advanced things. <br/><br/>One thing that bugged me that they never really explained when someone drinks the vibranium leaf juice thing, why do they essentially wake up in a weird heaven realm and see their ancestors? Who then give them power? <br/><br/>If its an alien world/species substance, does this mean it was from a world of blacks humans/aliens? Or does it just take black form in the heavenly place so they aren't afraid of it? Or do they actually see their ancestors? Its confusing. <br/><br/>More so since Marvel doesn't really have a ""god"" in their universe per say. They have entities that are god like of course. Best not to overthink it I guess. Overall I loved the movie and look forward to more!"

","Well first of all lower your expectations: this is not THE BEST Marvel movie but keeps up the bar set by the Captain America ones. This is not a movie that will ""redeem the african culture"" as hyped in media, as it's more of the same MCU showed so far in terms of script. So yeah the main cast is black, and they're impressive at it: the script doesn't cartoon them like other films in the past but, c'mon, they might as well be Sakaarians, they still feel like comic book characters.<br/><br/>This is a love song, not a warsong. The movie is both personal and consistent with the universe Marvel created, and there's nothing wrong with that unless you hate superhero comics in general. It's no more politically loaded than The Winter Soldier and Civil War were, as it just scrapes world issues the presence of superheroes and supervillains would both benefit and harm. The script is not the strong point, though it's also not bad, and it gives as in all MCU movies much respect for its characters than even the comics did.<br/><br/>So what's the strong point? Those freaking visuals again! The movie, as most of the MCU, is GORGEOUS. I foresee most Oscars going to the visual department, and I hope it wins at Best Costume Design. As i said, this movie is a love song and it shows in all the little details that make part of the Wakandan setting. Busan and London don't look scrappy either, and Oakland (from where the director hails) is dignified by it.<br/><br/>It's kinda sad the strongest political message came, again as in many movies, from the villain. I suppose many who wanted to politicize (pro or against) this film were expecting ""dem truths"" dropped like mics, but it's usually the unfettered, the ""evil"" who says those words and this film didn't disappoint in that aspect. Sooo... does that mean they're ""evil"" statements? Does it take to be amoral to say what the african-american people want to say?<br/><br/>As good the actors were, the main characters were a little bland except for the scene stealer MAH MAN M'BAKU. He was both strong and hilarious. There was so much that could've be done with Forrest Whitaker but hasn't, because all the young actors carried the movie in their shoulders and among them Winston Duke was the MVP. I somehow wish he was king but at least he got a much better limelight than in the comics."

","This movie is not a Marvel movie. If you think it's going to be like others, you are wrong. I don't think it rightly compares to Marvel's typical fare. I love the MCU, but this movie is in a category of It's own. I think that is why people are giving it low review numbers. (Plus, i've heard some people are intentionally trashing it, which is very sad.) The movie is beautiful visually. From the set, to the costumes. The CGI could be better in the fight scenes where he is Black Panther, but this is why I took away a star. Yet the story is what makes this more than a typical Marvel Superhero movie. It is a story about old traditions and new. The acting is superb!!! I've seen complaints and I am completely baffled by it. Angela is wonderful, I felt Chadwick's pain at Forrest's death, I understood Michael's hurt over being left alone. This is a drama movie with Action to support it, not the other way around. For that reason, It's not a Marvel movie in my eyes. It's more and phenomenal!! I saw it on Friday opening weekend and will take my Mom next weekend."
"danteism","9","2","10","17 February 2018"," Easily the best MCU since the original Iron Man and the first Avengers film!
","For anyone wondering about the disparity between the 100% positive critics reviews on RottenTomatoes and the not quite as universally high ratings here do yourself and Google ""Anti Black Panther Campaign"". <br/><br/>Putting aside all that nonsense Black Panther is simply a FANTASTIC piece of entertainment from start to finish.<br/><br/>I've seen every single MCU film to date and this one stands with the very very best of them. For a while now the MCU films have been starting to get into a bit of a formulaic rut. At worst they're always at least entertaining but Black Panther is a true return to form with exactly the right mix of humor, action, drama, style and sheer wow factor. <br/><br/>Do not let anyone convince you that the film is preachy or over the top with political soapboxing. That's simply not the case. The themes explored here are UNIVERSAL and could have been applied to virtually any culture, while at the same time the incredible costuming, soundtrack, and art direction tapped deeply into dozens of African cultures to create a visual and stylistic tapestry that was simply breathtaking.<br/><br/>Even if that holds no appeal whatsoever, taken simply as a work of pure action entertainment the movie delivers by every measure. Action was fantastic, fight choreography the best since Netflix's Daredevil, and a stronger narrative arc than any MCU movie to date. The storytelling was simply superb with a clear beginning, middle, and end and rock solid character development. The writer did not fall into the recent pitfall of other MCU films of spinning out too many sub-plots or characters and instead masterfully focused on the core story at hand. <br/><br/>As such this may well be the best stand alone MCU film since we were first introduced to Tony Stark in Iron Man, while still fitting perfectly into the larger MCU pantheon.<br/><br/>Believe the hype."

","This movie is fantastic as a stand alone film and part of the MCU. ***There are a few spoilers ahead***<br/><br/>I was worried given all the hype that this film would not deliver on the level of hype it was receiving, but it does. The action is fantastic, the characters are well developed and amazing. The real issues they bring up are amazing and it's only in small doses, so it does not alienate certain movie goers. It does give you a perspective from others point of views, and thought provoking. The conflict between what to do and what not to do(especially between the protagonist and antagonist) is what is most compelling to me. The action scenes are amazing (except for one), and the creative minds behind what technology can all be gained by vibranium is sensational. <br/><br/>Like all movies, there are a couple flaws, it got a little slow and it is predictable. That is not the movies fault though as it is within this universe so it has restrictions on where they can take things within one installment. The CGI in the fight scene at the end between T'challa and Kilmonger was a little poor, but did not take away from the movie. All of the actors did a fantastic job, there wasn't one bad performance in the film. Overall 10/10!!!"

","I am a comic collector in the veteran category. I'm also a movie buff. With the advent of the Comic revolution, you'd think someone like me would be in paradise. Best of both worlds right?Sadly - no. 
Only a handful of comic adaptions work. A very small handful. The suspension of disbelief isn't the issue. It's more basic than that. 
It seems we have a generation of fans willing to pan down the swill that Hollywood serves up like there's no tomorrow. 
Mindless action and CGI FX, take priority over characterisation, script, continuity and just plain substance. 
Added to that is the PC agenda. 
Added to that is the abject disrespect that Hollywood treats the original material and the creators of it with. 
I'm ashamed on behalf of the keepers of the flames. I'm downright embarrassed actually. 
Until fans lift their sights a bit and demand more, the studios will churn out rank movies that offer only superficiality and rake in the money. 
Nearly none of the movies are made by ""fans"". We know how great it can be when a fan directs a movie. Peter Jackson showed us with LOTR.

","Black Panther is one of the best movie I've ever seen. It was released in 2018 and directed by Ryan Coogler. It was 2h15 long.<br/><br/>This movie is a perfect mixture of action, adventure, sci-fi and fantasy. The cast is very judicious because the actors who play in this film are famous: Michael B.

","This film redefined the superhero genre. Everywhere from the music to the action sequences. The film also redefined Hollywood and shattered both expectations and stereotypes with its primarily black cast. The movie also added some cultural and societal references that made everyone question the society we live in.
The cinematography was spectacular. The film makers blended traditional african clothing and culture with futuristic technology to create a world that seemed both tangible and out of reach. The acting was phenomenal. Chadwick Boseman did an excellent job portraying T'Challa, who is conflicted with his traditional values and what he'd experienced in the rest of the world. Michael B. Jordan definitely stole the show as Erik Killmonger. His superb portrayal of the sympathetic antagonist left audiences with both tears and cheers. Letitia Wright also added some excellent comic relief as T'Challa's younger sister, Shuri. The film score by Ludwig Göransson was perfect. He blended traditional african music with modern day hip-hop to bring both Wakanda and its characters to life. The plot was phenomenal. There were many plot twists that kept the story rolling and the strife between the conflicted T'Challa and determined Killmonger added a lot of depth to the story. The cultural and social references that intertwined with the story related with the audience to make them feel they were part of the story, and that the story was a part of them. Black Panther is a film worthy of praise and will forever be one of the top movies of the century."

"vesil_vesalier","9","2","11","8 March 2018"," Not a Superhero movie... a movie about HEROES
","For every glowing milestone of excellence, for every new step towards a brighter, more peaceful future, there will be an *******, standing nearby, waiting to whip out his **** and **** all over it, trying desperately to keep a grip on the world that he knows: hateful, angry, belligerent-and completely beyond his grasp of understanding.<br/><br/> I saw BLACK PANTHER, expecting to see another superhero movie, only with a black man as the hero. I expected to see comic book canon that I would not understand, as I have never read a comic book with the Black Panther in it, nor even heard that such a character existed before I went to see the movie. I expected to see the tragic good man, suffer at first, only to gradually rise to the top, and become the hero that he was meant to be, as a shining example for all to look up to.<br/><br/> That kind of happened. Then again, that kind of didn't.<br/><br/> The trick, as I've come to understand it, is that the movie is not what we think it is. What we think, is that it's a superhero movie. But like THE DARK KNIGHT, there's more to it than that. To simply call it a superhero movie, to me, feels like an injustice, only because the label seems to minimize its impact, and its importance.<br/><br/> THE DARK KNIGHT is less about comic book heroes and villains coming to life, and more about philosophy, criminality, society as a whole. The Joker doesn't just kill people, and he doesn't just terrorize-he shakes Gotham City to its core, and forces everyone involved in its keeping to take hard, long looks at themselves, making them realize that good and bad are not crystal clear subjects, no matter who you are and what you are doing.<br/><br/> This film does something similar... it brings up subjects referring to racism and society not just in terms of America, but in terms of humanity as a whole. Should Wakanda broaden its horizons? Or should it remain a pure beacon of hope, as it is brilliantly portrayed, and keep its light from being threatened by the rest of the world and its hatred and greed? Should it share its technology with others, or be fearful of the lunatics that will use it to cause more terror and destruction?<br/><br/> Not easy questions to answer, and so the meat of the story is there, hiding behind the brilliant action sequences and humor. It's not easy to see which answer is best, and it is made worse by the arrival of the real villain, and his ties to Wakanda.<br/><br/> Wihout spoiling anything, I'll simply leave my commentary on what I think BLACK PANTHER is, and why it is so special. BLACK PANTHER is not a superhero movie at all, from my point of view. It is a hero movie, where those that try to do what is best for the land they love struggle against odds to do what they can, with no clear answer as to who is right or wrong, or why. The Black Panther is the leader, the King, but he is not the only hero, and does not outshine those that love and support him. He is surrounded by heroes, of various kinds and creeds, and each shows their honor and nobility in different ways throughout the film. <br/><br/> I was thoroughly impressed with BLACK PANTHER, and look forward to seeing it again. If I had a recommendation for anyone wanting to know if they should go and see this film, it is this: Leave your expectations at the door, try to keep and open mind, and above all else... remember that this is fiction, friends. Above all else, it is not real.<br/><br/> Which is a shame. Because I for one wish that Wakanda was real, and that people like this really existed."

"shawthingproductions","8","3","22","16 February 2018"," Great origin story, awesome effects, little too long maybe
","This is a great origin story. I have no idea who The Black Panther is or where he came from but left the film knowing all I needed to know. I thought the acting was good - with guards and royalty rightly subdued. Some complaints have said they're acting ""wooden"" but - no - they're acting with decorum. You wouldn't have a King act like, for example, Deadpool. The characters were mostly well-thought out with the exception of Killmonger whom I found a little lacking. He was enjoyable enough but - one minute he isn't there, then he is and this is his story thrown in quick. Okay then... It didn't ruin my enjoyment of the film but given the length (over 2 hours), perhaps they could have trimmed elsewhere to show more of him too? <br/><br/>The start of the film was a little muddled with the directing of the action sequence, which was a little hard to tell what was going on but thankfully it became better with later action sequences. As for action, there isn't a lot due to the story being told but what there was, was exciting enough even though - certain scenes - you knew how they would play out. For example, you know this person won't win this particular showdown because of whom they're up against, kind of thing.<br/><br/>The humour in this film isn't as much as other films but, again, it fits the world the story is in. Stan Lee's cameo was nice ;) I do like the fact he pops up in all of the films! <br/><br/>The scenery in the film was glorious, the CGI done properly (not like a certain DC film that came out recently). What I will say though, I went in thinking I would hate this film because the trailer just looked dull. I'm glad I went regardless. I'm not sure how they would do a good trailer for this without giving all of the action sequences away but... Yep... As far as Marvel Origin stories go, I believe this is one of the stronger despite a few niggles. I look forward to seeing more of Black Panther."

Killmonger is, by far, THE greatest villain in the MCU. And he isn't exactly wrong in his motivations, either; he just goes about things in the wrong way. He has so much depth, and so many layers -- you can't hate him. I feel all of his emotions. I also empathise with him completely. I'm living for the sequel. Easily the best film in The MCU. Kevin Feige said so, too. I wholeheartedly agree.

"htestroete","9","2","12","22 January 2019"," The best MCU movie to date
","Black Panther not only works as a superhero movie, but also as a commentary on the current state of the world. Black Panther is able to do almost everything right, with only some of the CGI being not on par with the rest of the film, but other than that the movie is near flawless. Chadwick Boseman returns to the character of T'challa for the first time since Civil War and he builds upon his great performance there to put in another one here. But for me, as great as Chadwick Boseman is, Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger is the best character in a movie filled with great characters. Jordan is able to play Killmonger with ease, and in my opioion is tied with Thanos for the best villian in the MCU to date, and is able to turn in a performance that is on par with the likes of Heath Ledgar as Joker in The Dark Knight. All of the side characters are able to add onto the already amazing quality of this movie, with Ulysses Klaw being particularly great. Andy Serkis plays the character for the second time after first playing him in Age of Ultron, and is able to add a sense of humor and grittiness to the character which makes him one of the most enjoyable to watch, even if his tenure is short lived. Another great part of this movie is the score, with each piece being able to convey the desired emotion of the scene, with the Killmonger theme in particular being outstanding, the tune really being to show how intimidating Killmonger really is. Wakanda is one of the most beautiful locations ever seen on screen, and the movie is able to really sell you on the hidden country. Another great thing about this movie is the astral plane sequence, which is drawing obvious inspiration from gen Lion King, which is actually drawn on a lot in this movie, which is not at all a bad thing. In conclusion, Black Panther is an amazing movie with great characters, setting, score, and story, which allow it to become one of my favorite films of all time, and the best the MCU has to offer."

"DeBBss","8","2","12","18 February 2018"," A Unique Marvel Movie...
","Black Panther in my opinion, is the most unique and different Marvel movie made so far. Many Marvel movies are copy and pastes of each other, and yes this movie does have some elements that were copied from other Marvel movies, but Black Panther made it its own thing. This movie has unique characters and a unique setting. Black Panther does have some issues though, like the overkill comedy and the iffy CGI. Although there are few issues with the movie, all of the issues are very noticeable and are not easy to ignore. Some scenes the CGI was very noticeable. There was just too much CGI used, I would like a little more practical effects. The comedy was just too much, I don't want Marvel to keep putting this type of comedy in their movies. A little comedy is good, but too much can ruin a movie.<br/><br/>Story: 9/10<br/><br/>There was only one problem with the story, but everything else was on point. The climax was weak in my opinion. There was so much hype in the movie for the climax, but the climax was disappointing. When the climax happened, the CGI was very noticeable and looked fake at times, and when T'Challa and Killmonger fought, all I saw was CGI. There was no pacing issues, which was shocking, because the movie is over 2 hours long. There was some bits that made me yawn, but the movie quickly got to the action before it got a little too boring. Wakanda is the setting of the movie, and I'm happy the way it turned out. Wakanda has a very futuristic style, which makes it a good and unique setting. I like what's at risk in the movie. Some movies give that ""Save the world, it depends on you"", but this movie doesn't fall for that. If T'Challa doesn't stop Killmonger, then the world could be at risk, due to the rare ore Wakanda has that can change the world, because of how powerful it is. Killmonger's plan is to share the ore and basically expose Wakanda, which could lead to a giant war that can end humanity on Earth. Overall, the story is strong, with real stakes at risk and great pacing, but a horrible climax.<br/><br/>Characters: 10/10<br/><br/>The antagonist, Killmonger is a very strong character. Killmonger has realistic and emotional motives, which really isn't evil motives, but at the same time, it could end the world. Many villains in movies are bad guys because they're evil, but the villain Killmonger doesn't have that common issue. T'Challa is another good character. He's a diverse character, not only suffering from Killmonger, but the guilt of his father's death. The supporting cast is well done. Each actor/actress did a great job on their character. The acting was also great, Michael B. Jordan stole the show for me, even though he was barely in the movie. Michael B. Jordan made his character (Killmonger) a believable antagonist, by showing a dark and a light side of Killmonger, which in my opinion makes a good villain. Overall, all the characters had their own role in the movie. The protagonist and the antagonist have their own inner conflict, which makes them diverse characters.<br/><br/>Action: 7/10<br/><br/>The action was the weakest part of Black Panther. Both the CGI and comedy affected the movie negatively. The CGI was iffy at some parts, for example the climax. The climax was a mess, in my opinion. The CGI wasn't bad, but from a Marvel movie, I expected more. The comedy was just overkill to me, although some parts were funny and made me laugh, but it's just too much. I think Marvel is too focused on comedy at the moment. The visual effects were really well done though. I liked the visuals and the colors used. Black Panther is on the same level as Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which is a high level to set. Overall, Black Panther had a variety of colors and visuals that made Black Panther look amazing, but in some instances, the CGI looks very bad for a Marvel movie, and the comedy was just a little too much.<br/><br/>Black Panther was overall a good movie. There was some issues that really lowered the score for me, but with great directing and awesome action scenes, like at the beginning. This movie does everything right, to the characters and to the story. If Black Panther had a little more time to fix things up and look at the script, then Black Panther could've got a 10/10 from me. Black Panther earns it's place as a good Marvel movie. I recommend Black Panther to everyone who hasn't seen it yet. If you're looking for a good movie to watch, then Black Panther would be a good option."
"nikla-91572","2","1","4","5 May 2020"," Ultra disappointing movie from Marvel
","I had high hopes from imdb rating, and immediately had a high bar in expectation before watching.
The movie have really weak storyline, it is pretty racial with only two white characters: one is villain, and the other one is clearly stupid although it's CIA and pilot.
The villain had cool arm-gun and it should have used it way better to make more suspenseful action scenes.
Definitely is movie for specific audience.
CGI in movie is good, the scenery is nice, the superpowers of main character is disappointing (scratching like a cat and using force field in unwisely chosen times), acting is meh and couldn't wait to finish watching because it was so boring.
Definitely the worst Stan Lee movie."

The city of Wakanda is beautiful and this movie makes me interested in the culture of Wakanda.<br/><br/>The motivation of the villain is clear, he's not just a bad guy who wants to take over the world or that kind of typical, bland villain. We actually understand his motivation and why he is doing what he is doing. We understand where he came from and that's what makes a great villain.<br/><br/>The action sequences are all of course amazing and beautifully shot.

The villain is always going to lose, the hero will always win, even to the point of falling of the cliff and have the hero handing on by one hand, no sacrifices ever really have to be made, its full of cheesy one liners and doesn't really break from method. It was the same recipe, repeat over and over.<br/><br/>Until Black Panther, this felt completely new. It felt like anyone could be killed, no one was safe. The music was fresh and complimented the whole movie. The cast was awesome, they felt actually badass, like I would be intimidated if I came across Black Panther, compare this with other superheroes who seem so weak or lame.<br/><br/>The costumes and technology used was exciting and kept me interested throughout. The cast was funny and well chosen. Right from Chadwick Boseman throughout to all cast members there were great strengths in acting. Letitia Wright was very funny, alongside Michael B.

And the film knows and uses its mythology wisely.<br/><br/>Stylistically, it feels cut from a different cloth than that of its contemporaries. Director Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station, Creed), is a force of a filmmaker that has a distinct and powerful sense of story and direction. And while you sense studio involvement at times with horrendous CGI and a ""climax"" that doesn't match its mature build up, the film is balanced out enough with character and even some fantastic practical action sequences.<br/><br/>Black Panther is good film, even a great one at times based on its own merits, not on the hype that was seemingly fabricated for it..."

"williampsamuel","10","1","4","15 March 2019"," A Groundbreaking, Supremely Satisfying Superhero Blockbuster
","There's been a lot of hype building up to the release of this movie, based on Black Panther's appearance in Captain America: Civil War and the anticipation of the first truly Black superhero movie. Well Black Panther doesn't just live up to the hype; it exceeds it. Black Panther is a wildly entertaining and often thoughtful blockbuster that brings one of Marvel's more obscure heroes mainstream.<br/><br/>If you saw Civil War, you already know the basics. T'Challa is the Black Panther, prince of the wealthy, technologically advanced African nation of Wakanda. Following the death of his father, the time is at hand for his ascension to the throne. But of course the transition won't be smooth, with challengers to the throne and enemies both old and new threatening the kingdom.<br/><br/>One of the best things about this movie is its incredibly talented ensemble cast. Chadwick Boseman gives an extremely well-rounded performance in the title role. He's smart, brave, frequently intense, by turns easygoing and dead serious, and always imbued with a deep sense of duty and honor. And no matter what, he always has style. As Black Panther, Boseman sets a new standard of black coolness just as Jamie Foxx did in Django Unchained and Will Smith in Men in Black.<br/><br/>Of course he's not the only star to shine. At times Letitia Wright almost steals the show as Shuri, T'Challa's younger sister and personal Q branch. She's delightfully irreverent and sassy, and does she ever have some great gadgets to share. Lupita Nyong'o also casts an imposing figure and is a delight to see in combat as general Nakia, head of the royal bodyguards. Martin Freeman makes a good comic relief everyman as the film's token (or should I say Tolkien) white guy. And Andy Serkis is typically unrecognizable and delightfully insane as the villainous Ulysses Klaue. Seriously, this guy's nuts.<br/><br/>Michael B Jordan makes one of Marvel's best villains in recent years as Eric Killmonger. He's brilliant but uncultured, wisecracking but intensely angry, a kid from the streets with pretentions to rule an empire. And he is absolutely deadly. Jordan looks even more ripped here than he did in Creed, and he fights like Antonio Silva on steroids. And for all his ruthlessness and arrogance, he's not entirely unsympathetic. He's a man who's lost much and lived a hard life from an early age. He's driven by a desire to uplift the poor and oppressed, to help his people. It's just that for him that means igniting a global race war and seeking world domination.<br/><br/>There are beautifully choreographed fight scenes and excellent special effects galore. The casino brawl and car chase are fast paced and adrenaline pumping, and the final battle atop the mountain is particularly magnificent, like Lord of the Rings meets Star Wars. And visually the film is a real treat to behold. The costumes and set pieces are a whirl of colorfs, the camera work excellent, and the natural scenery is breathtaking. It's hard to believe this wasn't filmed in Africa.<br/><br/>While this is a Hollywood blockbuster made with a largely American cast, Black Panther has a profoundly African flavor, from the music to the fashions to the traditional storytelling scene at the beginning. Wakanda's visual design is also unique and distinctive. It's extremely futuristic but at the same time deeply African and tribal, with hover-trains and holograms alongside spears, thatch huts and lines of robed dancers. It makes for a fascinating vision of a society that's progressed farther than practically any on earth while staying deeply attuned to its roots.<br/><br/>The movie is also attuned to the culture and controversies right now. Let there be no misunderstandings: while there are subtle references to the Black Panther party, T'Challa is absolutely not a black militant or nationalist. The bad guy is. That said, it touches on poverty, drugs, mass incarceration and the sense of resentment its created. But it does so lightly, never in a preachy or confrontational way. Instead it's how T'Challa and Killmonger deal with these problems and the contrasting solutions they provide that drive the story.<br/><br/>Black Panther is well-acted, well directed, action packed and gorgeously shot, it's a real treat for Marvel fans and anyone who likes action. And fanboys rejoice, they even included Man Ape, albeit without the gorilla suit. Yet another triumph for Marvel Studios. I give it four out of four armored war rhinos."

","Black Panther My Review
(10/10)
This is by far the best Marvel movie ever. Impressively well-acted film. The difference with ""Black Panther"" is that, while observing the outlines of the traditional comic book arc, Coogler and his creative team have enlarged and revitalized it.
Drawing on elements from African history and tribal culture, as well as contemporary and forward-looking flourishes, ""Black Panther"" pulses with color, vibrancy and layered textural beauty, from the beadwork and textiles of spectacular costumes and warm, dazzlingly eye-catching production design to hairstyles, tattoos and scarifications that feel both ancient and novel.
The MCU not only needed this movie, but all of the United States needed this movie. For a superhero movie, ""Black Panther"" exceeds exceptions and is sure to leave its impact of being one of the best in its genre. Socially aware, aesthetically captivating and emotionally pulling, this movie is one that is sure to leave its mark as one of the best superhero movies of recent memory."

At one point the baddie says Death is preferable to Bondage, but the historical statistics wouldn't support such a view - and besides, every living creature on the planet is born into bondage to life unto death.

"decima1870","10","1","4","27 August 2018"," A truly enduring epic
","This is definitely one of the greatest Marvel films by far with an engaging plot, a compelling villain and an important message. Black Panther's monumental success at the box office is certainly evidence that this film crosses many boundaries and touches people in a fundamental way. While the film delivers the expected action, moments and humor seen in all the Marvel movies it also speaks to historic problems in the United States and the world. Certainly the race and poverty message is a poignant one and resonates with not only African Americans but also any historically exploited or oppressed people.
It is interesting to note how some Caucasian Americans have reacted to Black Panther over some other Marvel films. Some white people that I have encountered (especially the overly-sensitive Trump supporters) seem to be insulted by the racial overtones of this film and cannot possible separate those notions from the rest of the film's quality. It is important to note that among the prior criticisms here on IMDB you will see many ""I'm not racist but"" comments or at least claims at not noticing the race of the actors. As we see in the age of dog whistles to white supremacists these claims are typical of such people. 
It is very sad to be living in a time when people cannot separate their own political biases from judging quality artwork. Black Panther is an exemplary piece of entertainment just like most of the Marvel movie franchise entries and no doubt that the inclusion of an almost all African American cast made the film more attractive to a worldwide audience. It is obvious that some weak minded viewers simply cannot stand it when minorities gain great success weather it is in attaining the highest office in America or making block buster films. In the end, the overwhelming evidence by multiple sources prove Black Panther to be a great movie but it's detractors who are racially motivated really aren't interested in truth backed by objectivity; they only want to see their own frailty supported by hate filled opinion."

 Even the villain was more likeable then the ""good guy"" black panther, bad story, bad build up, no character development, average acting and forced humour that wasn't needed.
I'd rather watch Batman trilogy 3 times over then this crap"

","First of all, I have to say I liked Black Panther in Civil War, I thought he had a cool looking suit and he looked cool while fighting. I did not have high expectations for this movie though even after I saw how hyped it was.<br/><br/>I have to say this movie is quite boring and the whole plot is a mess. I did not like it. Not one bit. The CGI was cheap too. I dont say it is BAD, its just not good and I cannot understand how can people love it so much, but maybe I just did not get it."
"wescarpenter-48666","9","1","4","20 April 2018"," Black Panther Film Review By Logan Coleman
","Black Panther is the latest film directed by Ryan Coogler. I will start out with the performances that were good which are Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, Andy Serkis. Sterling K Brown has a very small role in the film, but you can feel his impressive performance in throughout the entire film. This film is a little bit different when it comes to amount of blood due to the different forms combat that is in the film. This film has references from Star Wars Episode 1 the Phantom Menace, 007 films, Kingsman films, Batman Begins and the Dark Knight. Winston Duke in my opinion is the breakout star in the film and I would encourage people to look at him for more work in the future.<br/><br/> I can honestly say that I did realize that he had small role on Modern Family. The performance of Letitia Wright reminded me in the best way of Q from 007 franchise. Danai Gurira performance reminded me of Viola Davis ferocity meets the agility of her character from the Walking Dead. Michael B. Jordan is the performance that I am still on the fence about I would describe of having elements of Malcom X, Blown Away, the Dark Knight, Déjà Vu. I can see this film being nominated for the 91st Oscars for best score, cinematography and costume design. My only real complaint with the film was with one of the special effects in the scene seemed not to be finished. I am going against most other film critics; I am giving this film 9 and ¾ stars out of 10."

","I saw this movie opening weekend and my hopes were not as high as the hype. Honestly, it exceeded my expectations. The visuals were gorgeous and well thought out, as most Marvel movies are. The story line dealt with some very real spoken and unspoken issues across the Black Diaspora and their connections to colonization but it didn't handle those issues in a preachy way. The historical implications of this movie are clear and the determination to celebrate the beauty of Black skin and natural hair in the visuals was uplifting. I'd go see it again.

","T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) plans to succeed the throne from his dead father, but new and old enemies challenge his position as a new leader in Wakanda. To make things worse, Wakanda adopts isolationist tactics to hide a precious metal called Vibranium that makes this African country technologically superior. Can T'Challa continue to rule this country from outsiders (and insiders too) and keep Vibranium from the world?<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman triumphs as T'Challa; his portrayal isn't as transformative as his previous works (Jackie Robinson, James Brown, and Thurgood Marshall), but it's intelligent and competent. Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, and Angela Bassett provide great comic relief and a substantial amount of substance and power in this movie. Michael B. Jordan plays a strong villain with a valid reason. The director, Ryan Coogler, emphasizes his concerns and priorities ranging from isolationism, oppression, aiding strangers, and acceptance of African and African-American experiences. Also, there's some sick beats in this movie (da-dum da-dum DOOM WUBWUBWUB WOMP tshh).<br/><br/>Pacing structure is odd (or does the film have a structural problem in Act One). By odd, I mean, the first act of the film (so the first thirty minutes) relies on a lot foreshadowing and world-building which is a hindrance. Mainly, a hindrance because these narrative elements complicate the plot. It's great to watch a Marvel movie with a complex plot, but it removes the fun and becomes serious (that may confuse the family friendly demographic, specifically children).<br/><br/>Additionally, the film drags in the middle and the end. In the end, CGI consumes the fight scenes making the film less intense and becomes hard to cheer for a character in a CGI suit that fights less like a human and more akin to a cartoon. Finally, some moments feel similar to ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"" (maybe I'm the only person who experienced that feeling). Although I have objections, their minor and finicky, shouldn't thwart a satisfying movie experience."

"lemmonsjack","8","1","4","17 March 2018"," Has some noticeable flaws but still intertaining blockbuster.
","Black Panther was not Marvels best but not the worst. The main plot of the film was very well developed and the twist about Killmonger in the middle of the film was also very interesting. I feel like there was more to explore but it was also a very unpredictable film.unlike some superhero movies you don't know what's about to happen. I feel like most of the characters were written in the film pretty well. One thing I don't like about this film was the way they treated the character Klaw. Killmonger's orgins was developed well, but I was disappointed with the way that they handled Klaw.<br/><br/>The following is my opinion so don't judge 
 
I personally think Klaw shouldn't have been killed off so early in the film. I think Klaw should have used Killmonger to get in to Wakanda. Then Klaw should be trying to steal Vibranium and other tech and then Klaw finds Shuri's lab and takes the Golden Jaguar suit and gives it to Killmonger. He then uses Killmonger as his body guard or muscle while he gets further into plan of stealing vibranuim. But as the movie goes on Killmonger realizes he is being mistreated and desides to overthrow Klaw and ends up killing him. Than Killmonger would be the main villain for the last 20 minutes or so.<br/><br/> Back to my actual review... They did a good job of balancing serious scenes and comedic scenes I loved all of the characters Sheri was my favorite and overall the movie was pretty good there were some other things that bugged me as I was watching it. One thing was how the hell are they so rich they've never shared their tech with the rest of the world. So why do the have so much MONEY?!!? Also I was disappointed that they didn't even introduce the soul stone. Now yeah we now know that it's not in Wakanda but up next is infinity war so will they have enough time to introduce it in Infinity War?"

","I went into Black Panther expecting that it would be good, but I didnt know what was in store for me.<br/><br/>First off, Michael B Jordan as Killmonger was Amazing. Best Marvel Villian by far.
And we can't forget the rest of the cast.
Chadwick Boseman was amazing as expected, Andy Serkis was brilliant as usual and Letia Was Amazing as Shuri.She is my favourite Character in the MCU By Far.<br/><br/>The action was Fantastic, the acting was on point. The story was surprisingly dark but uplifting at the same time.<br/><br/>The only thing that would let it down was the CGI. Some of it looked of at the end of the movie but it didnt bother me all that much.<br/><br/>I really recommend going to see Black Panther

"kittredgemkittylissiegir","9","1","4","11 March 2018"," Black Panther was Interesting
","While most Marvel movies are known for the high-packed action and simplistic story telling, Black Panther attempts to be thought-provoking and intelligent. It wove together cultural and social themes, themes that people today are becoming afraid of, themes that are unique to the super hero and Marvel universe.<br/><br/>The only Marvel movie that was this intelligent was Captain America Winter Soldier. The movie was exciting, all of the characters were excellently developed and showed many layers, from the hero, to the sidekicks, to the villain. <br/><br/>The story itself might remind people of The Lion King, but if one is familiar with many African cultures, the Lion King wasn't just inspired from Hamlet, but also African story-telling as well. Black Panther came out LONG before The Lion King. Still, because most people have heard such storytelling, it's hard not to find the cliche in this film. Honestly, it's getting hard to avoid cliches in general. What haven't we seen, as movie-goers? Black Panther stuck to a solid backstory and it works for the film.<br/><br/>The only people who may not relate to this movie are people who have never been colonized or taught to empathize with people. Of course, this movie would relate to black people and people of color who understand the messages. But I found it strikingly interesting the amount of people who disliked the movie because they couldn't relate to the message or they felt the racial undertones were negative. I actually felt that made the movie carry more substance. And if anyone can empathize at all with people who are different, they would realize the themes of the movie aren't to different from any other story about warriors. <br/><br/>My one drawback with the movie is that I didn't see enough of Black Panther in his element. He wasn't wearing his attire very often and he didn't save regular civilians. He saved his kingdom, but other people were rarely the focus.<br/><br/>The weakness of other Marvel films, this movie had as a strength. The strengths of the other Marvel films were not present in this movie. Of course, I prefer a movie with a measure of depth as a opposed to mindless action and one-liner jokes."

","This is a movie that brims with rich culture, spectacular story, drama and action. I really loved every second of it. The villain is probably the most well characterised character ever put on a Marvel film. King T'Challa's quest to find out the truth of being a king is a very beautiful portrayal of the hardships of being a leader and the legacy that you carry with you. The feminism is on point here. Seldom do we see many women involved in an action scene in many dumb movies. This is not the case here. You get to see Okoye take down a car with a spear in an awesome manner, and so much more... even women soldiers fight in the end with the tribes. This movie is populated with feminism, racial equality and most importantly, a story that brims with heart and moral choices that decide one's fate. This is a super-hero movie that you've never seen.

"themachine-06512","7","1","4","2 March 2018"," c+ effort, but was it worth the hype?
","First of all i think i am obligated to say that this is not a race thing to me. i like the fact that we have a new black superhero movie, after years of neglect. but i don't think that fact should affect my opinion, because when it comes down to it, its really just another marvel movie. and just because it isn't whiter than a yeti in a snowstorm doesn't mean its worth a 100%, or even a 90%
with that out of the way, here is what i liked and didn't like
overall i mostly enjoyed the cast. they played the roles fine, although looking back it wasn't too above average. they acted fine, had alright chemistry, and overall i didn't mind.
the plot, i thought, was pretty good. i liked what they did with the villain, and although they could of done more with the panther, i thought the way they worked the plot was alright.
the action was also fine, could have been better, but it did its job of entertaining, and was really one of the better parts of the film.
finally, i really liked the visuals. wakanda looks pretty cool, the characters are well designed, and overall i don't really have many complaints. you COULD say it looks a bit generic, but it didn't phase me.
overall the main flaw of the movie is that it wasn't very memorable. if this film didn't have a mainly black cast, then there would be nothing that makes it stand out. there are parts that i like, like (and i hate to say this) some of the political takes were interesting. and i don't mean ""yadda yadda have black people in movies more"", thats kinda a given. what interested me was the take on bias and racism. because not only do the white characters have their bias beliefs (the fbi guy treats wakanda as pretty lesser until learns of its power), but so do the black characters. one of them calls the fbi guy a ""colonizer""(which is fair enough, but its still kinda racist), the villain hates all white people and wants to colonize THEM, the entire movie seems to have the message that hatred can come from anywhere and anyone, and instead of fighting each other over our differences and conflicts, we should band together and try to find a common ground, that will hopefully strengthen us both.
but other than that, i can't really say the movie left an impact on me. it was okay, maybe in the 75-77% range, definitely slightly above average, but nothing too special. overall its just yet another overhyped marvel movie."
"autisticreviewers","Null","1","4","1 March 2018"," Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie:
","Being the 18th film of the MCU and the last film before the highly awaited and anticipated Infinity War, Black Panther reintroduces the African based superhero (as he was introduced in Civil War) in his own solo film and boy was this one an unexpected surprise. I was suspecting the same routine that the previous films that we have seen, not to say that it's bad as I love Marvel regardless but it's director Ryan Coogler (Creed) has managed to bring a fresh coat of paint to the storytelling of the movie whilst delivering a style that is unique and beautiful.<br/><br/>Firstly, the choice of the film's direction is great and promises to set new paths and future stories, but it's the tone of the film that showcases the race of black people as a culture that is unique and often referencing the racial issues that occur in reality but while being a superhero movie.
The acting cast are all strong, both the male and female roles in this film are used well, in particular with its villain Marvel have finally given us a villain that not only has a backstory but serves great as a threat with a purpose and isn't wasted at all. Michael B. Jordan (who had shined in Creed) plays this part with perfection and not since Spider-Man Homecoming have I seen a great villain to actually care for.<br/><br/>Overall, Black Panther is a great entry in the MCU and it's one of the best films in the top 10 of the franchise as a whole. A strong director, solid performances, well written script, visually stunning style, great music score and great character development make the film a worthwhile treat for the fans and even the African American culture."

"swilliky","8","1","4","27 February 2018"," Astounding Marvel Cinematic Universe addition, one of the best!
","This great new addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe manages to distinguish itself from other superhero films with a fresh batch of characters and a memorable villain. In a brief prologue, the history of Wakanda is explained and Prince N'Jobu (Sterling K. Brown) is murdered by his brother, the king of Wakanda. In the present day, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns home with Okoye (Danai Guira) after the death of the king of Wakanda in a previous film. First, they stop to pick up Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), T'Challa's ex, and a spy for the hidden society and beat up some sex traffickers. T'Challa is greeted by his mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett) and his younger sister Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright), who makes fun of him for freezing and updates his technology. Meanwhile, in London, Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) steals a hidden Wakanda artifact with the help of Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) showing their brutality and willingness to murder in cold blood.<br/><br/>To ascend to the throne, T'Challa must drink a special potion and fight anyone who challenges his rule. Member of several tribes including Nakia and W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) decline to fight T'Challa but M'Baku (Winston Duke) of the mountainous Jabari tribe does challenge him. They fight and T'Challa forces him to yield. He then eats a heart-shaped fruit which restores his powers and allows him to travel to the afterlife where he talks with his father about the burden he is inheriting. He spends some leisure time with Nakia trying to convince her to stay in Wakanda and looking at the giant rhinos raised by W'Kabi when Okoye calls him back to the council. Klaue has resurfaced in South Korea to sell the Wakanda artifact and Black Panther must stop him. Shuri, with great comedic wit, suits him up with a new necklace suit and even more advanced technology.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

","First and foremost this movie was incredible and although many may say this is just a movie (for some) it has much more to offer. The story line and the underlining messages about divide amongst people can be seen in a way that provokes thought and emotion, the beauty of how Africa is represented is done fantastically in a way that's been long overdue in Hollywood. <br/><br/>Action sequences, acting, sub plots, and over all film is a solid 9/10 well worth the time and money. The side characters are so charismatic that you gravitate and look forward to their next appearance throughout the story. <br/><br/>The downsides to the film were a few plot holes here and there such as the relationship between Okoye and W'Kabi which is mentioned between both characters but never manifested. Also who Erik Killmongers mother was is never explored. <br/><br/>The movie doesn't move aesthetically as an Avengers film but looks like one, so the pace is different and there's more of a realistic feel with this one. Black Panther will definitely go down in history as one of the greatest action movies of this generation and not even based off of hype but based off of the facts. This is not the first black lead super hero movie but its by far one of the best and it is the first African represented superhero movie there's no other like it."
"hakrames","9","1","4","24 February 2018"," Black Panter Review
","Black Panther may not be the first leading African American star in a superhero movie but it by far one of the most impactful and memorable ones to ever come out and exist. Black Panther picks up right after the events of Captain America: Civil War following Chadwick Boseman (T'Challa/Black Panther) and the rise of a new king and the struggles that come from the responsibilities of it. <br/><br/>Performance wise everyone did a flawless job, between the accents of the Wakanda people to the beautiful, Blade Runner like city designed to the artistic fight scenes and tightly written dialogue creates a movie worth watching. Every character, even Stan Lee with his famous cameo, just come off with such power and leaves the viewers with such impact and lots to think about from each line of dialogue delivered. Both Boseman and Jordan make the ranks of fans and critics favorite characters in the MCU to date along side with the array of supporting actors (Freeman, Gurira, Nyong'o, Whitaker, Kaluuya, and Serkis). <br/><br/>Action wise this movie is visually stunning. With Coogler transferring his use of beautiful follow cams from Creed and using the same Cinematographers from Creed and Kingsman: The Secret Service and Kingsman: The Golden Circle to choreograph the fights and film them so flawlessly and beautifully makes Black Panther one of the best action movies of the year by far. <br/><br/>Special Effects look beautiful with the Kinetic Suits and the Vibranium infused weapons used by the Wakanda warriors and Boseman. Each site of the city gets more and more beautiful with its subtle yet so appealing to the eyes. By far my favorite was the kinetic energy used when the Black Panther suit was charged up. <br/><br/>Ryan Coogler gave it his all with Black Panther and didn't hold back a single bit with is beautifully written film that was directed so perfectly. I was a fan when I saw his work with Jordan on Fruitvale Station back in 2014 and loved his work even more with yet again Jordan in Creed and how Coogler has cemented himself in with the MCU as being one of the best directors working to date. <br/><br/>My overall Score for the film has to be a 9.5/10"
"The_Man_XX7","7","1","4","23 February 2018"," Same Marvel Concept But Different in Execution
","There are a lot to of things to say about out this movie but first and for most i just have to say this movie was good,i had fun with it and it's what i've come to expect from a marvel movie with a few surprises added.Now not that anything has to do with this but as an African myself i found this movie to be very accurate in it's depictions of Africa and the general culture than recent Hollywood films that have African lore or storylines so that was a nice bonus.<br/><br/>First and foremost what i enjoyed from the movie was the characters this is one of the few movies whereby almost every character no matter main-cast or side cast was done right.I enjoyed Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther,Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia,Micheal B Jordan as Killmonger and special shoutout to Danai Gurira and Letitia Wright as they portrayed their roles very well mostly because i didn't expect them to be so good.Now since this is a Marvel movie we all know
there is going to be humor and Black Panther truly did have some funny moments that were well executed and rather unexpected with made the movie more of a fun time to watch,BUT AGAIN since this is a Marvel movie there was some campy and unneeded humor which toke away some of the seriousness of
the movie sometimes and just uneven,and it can be disappointing that Marvel still don't know how to balance funny moments and serious moments sometimes.<br/><br/>However the action was very good,Black Panther has some of the most enjoyable action sequences since Captain America: Civil War and i especially liked how some action scenes were gritty and grounded while other fight scenes had more of a comic book movie style which was very fun to see and also a bit different.Now for the story,i personally liked the story not just because it was different than any Marvel movie because of it's cast or location but because it related to the real whole in some aspects and we haven't seen that since Captain America: The Winter Soldier dealing with stuff like politics or social commentary so it was greatly appreciated and needed.<br/><br/>The Villain Killmoger is easily in the Top 5 if not Top 3 of best Marvel villains or best villains in recent superhero movies,because who understood his motives for being the way he is and why he is doing the things he did.Micheal B Jordan was good in the role had felt like a genuine threat to Black Panther and Wakanda and his motives again weren't generic or cliche and his story is clear and fully explained in the movie.<br/><br/>As for the bad things in the movie well,i didn't find anything that was a huge problem with the movie however this was not a perfect film.I already stated that some of the humor was forced and it doesn't seem like Marvel is learning from this also some character motivations for me shifted too quickly or easily for my liking,what i mean is during the course of the movie some events may lead a character to change during the course of the movie which seems weirdly easy and almost rushed for the sake of it this goes for Black Panther himself and Daniel Kaluuya's character but luckily it was too bad that it took your focus off the movie and another thing is certain things are not explained in the movie like the spiritual aspect is not explained and certain plot points come out of nowhere and the movie just expects you to be okay with this which is just super lazy.<br/><br/>Also these maybe nitpicks but some of the special effects look weird and some of the African accents are exaggerated (don't know maybe because i'm African and i notice this stuff).Now as i said the movie is pure Marvel 101 but it is different in how it executes things like the villain and how the hero grows from his challenges and learns from his mistakes which is good story-telling and the world of Wakanda was well detailed and again the African culture aspect of the film as super on point and the world building was well done and sets up the future of Black Panther without being forced.<br/><br/>Some may say this is a typical Marvel movie and some of that is true but with over 10 films from Marvel it is nice too see that there can be new concepts and ideas to explore while maintaining the humor,action and well done story-telling that most Marvel movie have and can't wait for the future."

I usually do not watch any trailers for movies i know i will watch, but having seen about 20 seconds, and with all the hype and constant adverts, i decided i'll give it a gp...

","I almost love the film, The Black Panther. It's visuals are stunning, the CGI is wonderful, the cinematography is sumptuous, and the acting is really good...and then there's Michael B. Jordan. 
To say I was disappointed with his acting is a vast understatement. I get that he's supposed to be angry, vindictive, etc. But Jordan's interpretation of his character was like watching some bad '70's black revenge flick. It was all about being from the hood, and the whole 'we're an oppressed people' attitude that really sinks Jordan's acting and the reasoning for his taking the throne. 
For a character who is supposed to be so educated, so highly trained, he only came across as an angry man who is only out for revenge. Add in the ridiculous and incongruous fact that, despite all his anger throughout the film, he suddenly reverts to a contemplative man who says he always wanted to see the beautiful Wakandan sunsets his dad had spoken of years previously as he sat dying near the films' conclusion.
Such a change in a character is either terrible acting, bad scriptwriting, bad directing or editing, or a combination of all three. Jordan is a decent actor, but his performance in the Black Panther is just terrible and completely detracts from the film as a whole. Too bad. This movie could have been spectacular."

","This movie entertained me for two hours and exactly that was my expectation. Marvel movies arent doing anything spectacularly cool anymore, but they deliver on action and effects. I feel though, as that CGI could use another leap forward in technology. I am starting to get too used to it and spotting it is getting easier and easier and that just takes one out of the immersion.<br/><br/>About the ""controversy"": I think those groups that hype the movie for their black background are equally annoying as those that bash it for the overhype. But good for Marvel both groups generate more attention for the movie. Well done, folks!<br/><br/>Overall: I had fun eating popcorn to this"

","Going into this film i just assumed that this would be your average Marvel superhero film with some social commentary tacked on, but i was actually pleasantly surprised. This is a film that, for a superhero film, is fairly unique whilst still familiar to what we love about Marvel<br/><br/>The film is set in a normal earth, yet on this earth is a country called Wakanda, a prosperous african nation run by several tribes who are ruled by a king known as the Black Panther. After his father's death, T'Challa takes his place as the king of the nation, however this is shortly interrupted by the arrival of an american named Erik Killmonger, who is revealed to be the son of T'Challa's uncle, killed by his father. After successfully challenging T'Challa to the throne, Killmonger plans to wage war on Earth to fight the oppression that black people face, whilst a group of T'Challa's close allies fight to stop him.<br/><br/>On the whole, the film is an enjoyable experience. The effects are brilliant, but not too in-your-face, and this is a much more human film than a lot of other superhero movies, with lots of character interaction and bonding. The social commentary on race is well inserted and doesn't feel too overbearing in the film. The acting is superb all around, as are the overall characterizations, and overall i found it fairly difficult to really fault the film.<br/><br/>However, whilst it does a lot of things very well, there is nothing that it does exceptionally. At no point in the film did i think 'wow, this is the best thing ever', more 'yeah this is pretty good'. Whilst a fun film to watch, it isn't really one i would watch again or remember watching in the future.<br/><br/>Overall i would definitely recommend this film, even if you aren't a big marvel fan, as it is a well written, well acted movie that can make for thought-provoking movie - just don't go in expecting to see the greatest movie ever made."

"dixitvarma95","7","4","35","17 February 2018"," Here's what you need to know!!
","What's good: The power packed action sequences and graphics give you a visual bonanza that warrants a positive rewiew when you leave the theatre. The 3D effects make it even more stunning!! Get ready to dive into the mystical world of Wakanda, with their picturesque landscapes, vibranium modified animals, unique rituals, and...... Wierd looking people.
What's not really good: The storyline would have been awesome, if you hadn't seen it, like a thousand times. No efforts to make to make it even a little bit less cliche. And the black panther seems like a distant cousin of the batman, you know with the technology and stuff.
I think you have better acting potential with some of the antagonists. Personally I feel Michael jordan leaves a better impact that anybody else.

"gandlbest","Null","4","35","17 February 2018"," what! I doesn't get better than this
","I sat at the movies on preview night with a full audience of laughing and impressed viewers. Including my husband and daughter- not am easy crowd to please. Marvel has walked the fine line between continuity with the Marvel universe and ingenuity. They took the formula that is distinctly Marvel, mixed it with the basis of the Black Panther storyline and added a modern twist. The cinematography in a second to none and while the fight scenes were by no means the focal point of the movie they were none the less epic. You can't take anything away from this movie without purposely throwing shade on what Marvel and the director Retrying to accomplish. We went into this movie with high expectations and I can Say unequivocally that we were not disappointed. We were pleasantly surprised with spider man homecoming and its unintentional inclusivity and blown away by Black Panther's meaningful, thoughtful and purposeful redefining of everyone's view of what it can mean to be African. They blew away every stereotype, while remaining true to the comic.<br/><br/>For people that say was predictable I say you put them in a catch-22 because if they veer from the Marvel story line then there's no continuity and it's not authentically Black Panther. They managed to tell the story, tell it well, make it beautiful , make it believable and make it congruous in such a way that you can have a Black Panther 2,3 and 4, and he can come back and join the Avenger as needed.
They captured the technological marvel that vibranium can bring when harnessed with the genius that Black Panther was known for, though they ascribed that genius to an independent, youthful little sister. Great twist there.
Someone complained about the single remote controlled plane, well Iron Man could have made multiple suits but he only made 1 to share with his wingman. In the same way, Shuri didn't water down her technology by putting it on am assembly line. 
To those who complained about them fighting their own people. Yea, think about it. Who else could even hold a prayer of matching wits and weapons with them. The Claw already made the point in the first fight scene. "" Those are vibranium cars, Idiots. Your bullets are useless."" The General brought the point home when the rhino stopped charging and smooches her face instead. That was Her Rhino to command. They took the theme of Civil War- or pained me to see The Avengers fighting each other tooth and nail- and made it even more personal. This was family against family and friend against friend. Having never read the comics, they evoked the same feelings of remorse for the fight that Civil War did in a single movie. That takes serious character development. 
And yes I had a tough time believing that T'Challa's life long friend would turn so quickly but many of us have experienced misplaced loyalties. He got caught up in the movement for all the wrong reasons.
I've seen enemy Avenger movie on the big screen except Guardians and Fantastic Four and this topped them all. Hands down. 
No one is peperfect and this IS a superhero movie- a genre not known for being deep- but this one went there. Rightfully so. They needed to go a little deep. They needed to explore the taboo subject of responsibility. Black Panther was breaking new ground when it came out in the comics. The movie had to live up to the legacy. Paving the way. Like Jackie Robinson. When you're first, you have to blaze the trail for everyone that follows. This movie set the bar high. I can't wait to see Falcon star in his breakthrough movie."

There was music based on the traditional music of old African countries that was good for the theme, and of course hiphop style music.

"sammycook","10","2","13","4 December 2018"," A Cinematic Masterpiece
","This may sound dramatic to some, or maybe a lot of people, but this isn't me being melodramatic or exaggerating my view of the movie. To me, Black Panther IS a cinematic masterpiece.<br/><br/>I could write a whole essay on why I adore this movie and why it is marvellous. Hell, maybe I will. But this is a review, not an essay, so here goes;
why Black Panther is a 10/10 star movie and a cinematic masterpiece.<br/><br/>First of all, the characters.
The characters of Black Panther are strong, complex, and three-dimensional. This is true for both the women and men in the story, the heroes and the main villain.<br/><br/>The three main women in Black Panther are strong characters as individuals, especially whose purposes and characterisation within the story aren't solely related to the men in it. They have their own motivations, beliefs, strengths, and weaknesses.
Shuri. Nakia. Okoye.
Shuri is incredibly intelligent, funny, and greatly skilled in science.
Nakia is kind, compassionate, diplomatic, and forward thinking.
Okoye is immensely loyal, determined, passionate, and dedicated.
Out of all the Marvel movies so far, Black Panther has the best representation for women in my opinion by far. I found myself internally screaming in awe at how awesome they are while in the cinema, especially at their badassery and boldness.<br/><br/>The men are also well represented, particularly T'Challa and Killmonger. They, like the women, are three-dimensional, strong, and complex. They too, feel real, as all great characters do. What is especially significant about these two, however, is the construction of them as main hero and main villain. T'Challa has the title role of the superhero Black Panther, while Killmonger is the villain. Despite being a villain, it is easy to sympathise with Killmonger, because he is a three-dimensional villain. His reasons for his behaviour are shown to us through his backstory and not only does it make the audience put ourselves in the 'villain' 's shoes and understand why he did what he did, but it did a brilliant job of demonstrating that people are complex and morally grey, that the person/character set up as a villain is only the villain from one side of the story. Killmonger himself did what he thought was right and what he was motivated to do based on his experiences. The depth and pain and heartache this added to the story and movie as a whole, as well as the characters and their relationships is what makes it significantly better than some other Marvel movies in terms of villain characterisation.<br/><br/>Then there is the representation of African people. As someone who is not African, I cannot speak on the representation of African people in the movie. I can only speak on what I observed and know, and that is, that this movie did amazingly well at the box office. Not just because it is a Marvel movie, but because it is a diverse, almost all POC cast Marvel movie. The fact that this movie did that well at the box office, as did other diverse movies such as Crazy Rich Asians and Coco, speaks volumes to the amount that diversity in cinema is not just wanted but needed. Online, on twitter especially, I saw people of colour, specifically African people, talk about how Black Panther impacted them, how seeing themselves represented in an entire cast of a Marvel movie felt. Black Panther means a lot to a lot of people and it's impact is another reason why it's absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>Now, the writing of Black Panther, Holy Hera. The writing of this movie, just WOW. It is witty, clever, character driven, exciting in every scene, emotional, and packed with social commentary. A kind of social commentary that is executed so well throughout the movie that it is intertwined with other aspects of the movie. It's sprinkled into the witty dialogue, Killmonger's backstory and characterisation, the relationships between the characters, gorgeous cinematography, wonderful acting, and exciting action. The social commentary isn't a smack in the face, it's a series of questions that are directed to the audience in subtle yet clear, and bold ways.<br/><br/>I've seen a heap of reviews on here, and other places, where people review it as ""overrated"" or ""overhyped"" but that seems a bit fishy to me. People do, of course, have the right to their own opinion and to express that opinion, however, I recommend that people who hate on Black Panther or who simply view it as ""overrated"" rewatch it. Not everyone will agree with me that it is a cinematic masterpiece, but please don't discredit it completely because of predetermined ideas about it or biases.<br/><br/>If all I've already said about Black Panther isn't testament enough to the brilliance of this movie, it's impact, and it's worthiness of 10 stars, then perhaps this will;
Out of every Marvel movie I've seen, this is the one Marvel movie that as soon as it had finished, I immediately wanted to rewatch it."

"edenarlenesoul","10","2","13","20 February 2018"," Africa without Colonization Imagined
","Black Panther is an amazing addition to the Marvel cinema efforts. This movie offers the most diverse cast and an interesting story line that fictitiously imagines an Africa without colonization by focusing on a hidden country. We currently live during a time when Africa has been completely gutted by European nations making Africa unstable in some countries. Black Panther captures the beauty of Africa, from the costumes inspired by various tribes, warriors, etc. protecting their valuable resources. Think about gold, diamonds, oil, and uranium and the many other precious metals of Africa and what has become of the countries where these resources exist. I read a comment on IMDb that described the film as divisive. When we take into account major blockbuster hits like The Great Wall with Matt Damon, God's of Egypt, Johnny Depp in Lone Ranger, and Jake Gyllenhal in Prince of Persia (To name only a few), these are all movies that we should consider divisive, especially when the main roles that should star native Americans, Iranians, Egyptians, and Chinese actors but star American white men, Black Panther is a breath of fresh air. I believe this film was only an introduction to the characters. We will and should see more. This is amazing film! Worth seeing it more than once."

","Black Panther is a visually delightful movie. <br/><br/>The story is nicely told, if predictable (though the sub-plot about the American-born prince added an interesting layer).

My new favorite is the king's tech wizard sister Shuri. <br/><br/>The costumes were wonderful and I like the way they interspersed actual African language (Xhosa) in the film. It is unusual to have a movie with many dark skinned black people playing positive roles, and this movie was ground breaking in that respect. <br/><br/>Some of the CGI in the action scenes was over the top, though we've come to expect that in Marvel films.<br/><br/>On the whole, Black Panther is a strong addition to the Marvel Universe.

","Wow. There's just not much to criticize here. I think the people who will be most disappointed are the people going in expecting a standard action-packed superhero movie where a costumed hero battles a costumed villain for the better part of two hours with a little dialog and drama interspersed so as not to get tedious and a forced and unnecessary romance subplot no one actually cares about. This is kind of the opposite.<br/><br/>It's an almost Shakespearean drama with fresh takes on everything that has made this genre feel tiresome. Beautiful world-building, artistic vision, mind-blowing sets, elaborate and gorgeous costuming, a dozen brilliant acting performances, a nuanced villain with a grounded real-world perspective and motivation, an extended cast that actually matters, a historical background that provides context without the endless flashbacks and hamfisted exposition, and a real sense of danger and importance surrounding the events.<br/><br/>There are a few predictable tropes that play out exactly as expected, but it's mostly fun and highly inventive in other areas. Killmonger is one of the MCU's best villains, and the final battle was like watching a Tron remix of a Capcom fighting game."
"hiraishinnojutsu","7","3","26","15 February 2018"," When Marvel decided to make remake 'Lion King', 'Fruitvale Station', and 'Game of Thrones' into one movie, 'Black Panther' is all you got (Though it mostly 'Lion King').
","My first entry in 2018, yeayyy.....!!! So here it goes....
When I watched it on the theater, I felt something not right about this movie. It almost didn't felt like, ""Marvelish"", in fact, it almost didn't felt like any mainstream superhero movie I've encountered over the past two decades since I was born for it tells more about the people and the reality some of us face around the globe than the hero himself. The effect of colonialism, racism, slavery, hatred, and the supremacist movement was put inside the heart of one man who is most likely to be the hero than the main character himself (whose alter ego becomes the very titular of the movie) had 'Black Panther' written as a literary source from the 18th - 19th century where slavery was at its peak: Erik Kilmonger.<br/><br/>So yeah, what I'm trying to say is: 'Black Panther' would turn out gloriously as a masterpiece had it been written as a book comparable to 'Sula', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Things Fall Apart', or any other works that focus on the mistreatments of the Blacks/Afro-Americans. But as a movie? Errrr... not so much. I mean it's generally good and I see why so many critics fall in love with it, but some elements ruin the elements and the messages that made 'Black Panther' more than a comicbook movie such as the cgi based one-on-one fight between T'Challa and Erik (in fact, many of the phenomenal Black Panther's moves and martial arts were done by computers). <br/><br/>I'm fully aware of the reason why they had to cgi-ed BP's over-the-top jumps, upper cuts, punches, kicks, overhead kicks, and so on, but at least try to involve more humanly approach (like wires, stuntmen, etc) and a more smooth cgi for these scenes to make it more realistic and pleasing to the eye. Why didn't they just copy the treatment of 'Captain America: Civil War' (2016) for the fight scenes in this movie? Can't you see that the fight and chase scene between Bucky, BP, and Captain America was among the most jaw-dropping action scenes Marvel Studios has ever produced without so much waste of cgi? Honestly, I prefer the Batman raid scene in 'BvS' (considered by many as a ****** movie) than the duel match between BP and Erik in a movie that many people love so much. Not to mention that some of the scenes make the movie a little bit boring that some of us inside the theater either checked their phones and probably asking themselves when the movie might end.
Despite all of the downsides, this is probably the only movie that makes me interested in the richness African cultures with all the traditions, the dances, the songs, the warcry, the outfits, the earings, the histories, the tools, the masks, their way of life, their faiths, etc. Like it or not, we have no other choice than to admit that 'Black Panther' is one of the boldest movie Hollywood ever produce for it explore the black continent as it has never been done before by any other American movies before (though fictional one). It helps us to open our eyes of the beauty of the real-world Africa in the time where most of us are more fascinated by the work ethics and the cultures of the Japanese, the beauty of the South Korean boy/girl band members and actors/actresses, the economic prowess and the development of China, or the beautiful views of European famous big cities. <br/><br/>The director (Ryan Coogler) has put so much effort in reminding us that this is a black people's movie, directed by black director, played by (mostly) black actors and actresses, about black superhero and the continent where he lives. You can easily find the director's intention from the African, 'Lion King-ish' backsongs on some of the scenes and the Afro-American rap style like the ones you can find in 'Fruitvale Station' or any other movies about black people. Ryan also didn't forget to put some Game-of-Thrones level of intrigue where the rightful king has to give up his rightful title and rightful throne to a stranger (who's actually the king's *SPOILER ALERT*) and the king's bodyguards (The Dora Milaje) have no option but to obey and protect their new king despite their resentment to him.<br/><br/>Oh wait, have told you about another BP's villain, Ulysses Klaue? Played by the great and magnificent Andy Serkis, Klaue is, in my most humble opinion, a more suitable choice for the role of an antagonist than the tragic hero Erik Kilmonger thanks to these factors: he is lunatic, he's been running for more than 30 years from the clutch of the most advanced nation in the history of the world in MCU (since the time when T'Chaka, the father of T'Challa and the Black Panther before him, was on his peak), he is pure evil, fearless, and almost reminds you of Heath Ledger's Joker from Chris Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'.<br/><br/>So far, 'Black Panther' is the movie we all have been waiting for (mostly by the people of color since they have so little amount of heroes/heroines that are worthy to represent them and they can look up to) since the hero's conception in the 60s, or perhaps, way long before that: since the golden age of Hollywood at the 30s in which American movies reached its peak of storytelling that focuses on its heroes/heroines/protagonists portrayed mostly (if not all) by white males/females. Not too great to me, but not bad either. It's good for a solo-debut movie, and it's the right move to pave a way for something much, much bigger yet to come to the MCU, something that is written and can be clearly seen by all the audiences who can patiently wait until the very end of the movie:<br/><br/> Black Panther will return in AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR"
"thierrysmall","7","3","26","14 February 2018"," no connection to T'challa
","It was a good film don't get me wrong but the main reason i didn't really like the film as much as everyone else is because i prefer killmongers character to t'challa. Having a villain like this is only good when you have an established superhero which you already feel emotions for. For example daredevil and the punisher. After watching daredevil season 1 you feel emotions towards daredevil making you always want to support him then with the introduction to the punisher and his origin it creates a choice for you to choose between daredevil and punisher in which morally you would end up supporting daredevil because of the heroism he has already shown. The tough choice you have to make adds some depth and emotional value to the show/film and makes the rest of the film/show more interesting. T'challa has not shown this heroism and sacrifice in the MCU yet. The only appearance was him trying to hunt down bucky for murdering his father. In civil war his role isnt very important and we do not get emotionally attached. t'challa seemed more interested in getting the girl than helping the outside world and takes him the whole movie to realise that he should help. That doesnt seem heroic to me. the origin of killmonger was far more touching and i felt his goals were justified. having your father killed by your own people while you are a child whilst your dad promised to take you back there must have been very hard and the amount of work he put into becoming king shows his motivation. Killmonger wasn't a villain by choice but was made one by the environment of which the wakandans left him in. Leaving him alone in the oppression that he faced was obviously not going to end well. t'challa's reaction to him coming to wakanda was not remorseful but was rude and didn't try to make up for his fathers mistake. it seems very hypocritical as he says something about not judging him on past kings but killmonger already put at a disadvantage due to his father. After beating t'challa, he in my eyes was the true king and for a place that goes on honour and ritual cheating to bring t'challa back by giving him the strength of the black panther doesn't seem right to me. You look at killmonger as a villain but he was only doing what our governments do everyday by giving and selling weapons to keep people oppressed. Meaning all the american superheroes you support are bad. All of this would be great for a sequel because we would have more of a connection to t'challa making us want him to win and question ourselves on the way. But i don't at this point and wasn't happy when t'challa prevailed i just felt disappointed. im not saying i agree with what killmonger was doing i just don't agree with t'challa either."

","This movie was awesome! Black Panther was one of my favorite parts of ""Captain America: Civil War,"" and this film shows why. This is ""Batman"" meets ""James Bond."" One review I read complained that the film didn't have enough action. I disagree. It had just the right amount. A film doesn't need action every scene to be good, it just needs a good story, and this film delivers. This film gives us the best MCU villain since Loki. He's one of the few villains that I can sympathize with. I'm not justifying his actions, but I get where he's coming from. The technology in this film is really cool. There's one scene in particular that I won't spoil but I thought it would make a great ride at EPCOT. The last 30 minutes alone were worth the price of admission. The final battle is so good and really drew me in! The dialogue is also very well written. This is one of the best films of the MCU. And it's not just a great superhero movie, it's just a great movie. Period.

"fernandoschiavi","8","1","5","21 March 2020"," Ryan Coogler manages to develop the characters and their interpersonal relationships and is competent in the action scenes.
","The 'Black Panther' was created by writer and editor Stan Lee and writer and illustrator Jack Kirby, appearing for the first time in Fantastic Four # 52 (July 1966) in the Silver Age of comics, being the first super- hero of African descent created by a mainstream American comic book publisher. This Marvel adaptation brings up the ancient origins of the Black Panthers, a cloak that is passed down from father to son and that traditionally stands in the line of succession between aspirants to the throne of the evolved - but not in the eyes of the world - kingdom of Wakanda.<br/><br/>After several speculations for decades about bringing the character to life in theaters, 'Black Panther' premieres satisfying everyone who has longed since the hero's first appearance in 'Civil War', which showed the hero in action after the attack that killed the his father, King T'Chaka, of the fictional kingdom of Wakanda, again bringing Chadwick Boseman as the character. For this adaptation, director Ryan Coogler, who also contributed to the script alongside Joe Robert Cole, manages to bring a mixture of mysticism, legends and African customs that portray this new world, isolated from the world and that keeps many secrets. If the first 'Guardians of the Galaxy' was daring to change the way a hero film relates to the public, adding the comedy to the genre, Ryan Coogler's feature has the audacity to review the parameters of this thematic foundation, inserting comedy in a few moments and prioritizing a more dense history, which deals with family disagreements, tribal conflicts and revenge.
'Black Panther' accompanies T'Challa who, after the death of his father, the King of Wakanda, returns home to the isolated and technologically advanced African nation to succeed the throne and to take his rightful place as king. But with the reappearance of an old and powerful enemy, T'Challa's value as king - and as Black Panther - is tested when he is led into a formidable conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda, and the whole world, at risk. Faced with betrayal and danger, the young king must gather his allies and unleash all the power of the Black Panther to defeat his enemies and ensure the safety of his people and their way of life.<br/><br/>The film received seven Oscar 2019 nominations, including Best Picture, with victories for Best Costume Design, Best Soundtrack and Best Production Design with total merit. Technically, the film is a visual spectacle. The production designer of Hannah Beachler and Jay Hart manages to portray a Wakanda in a fully satisfactory way, knowing how to preserve the most primitive aspect, maintaining the tribal concept of ancient African peoples with the high technology that came from the vibranium, which has shaped all that society since the beginning .<br/><br/>Throughout the projection, we are introduced to highly developed technologies capable of healing gunshot wounds in a short time, capable of developing costumes, vehicles with magnetic levitation, sonic stabilizers, surveillance equipment, ultramodern ships, buildings and futuristic architecture. Even the choice of Seoul, South Korea, as another scenario in history, maintains the same futuristic and technological identity as Wakanda. All this technology is very interesting in a more palpable and credible scenario than previously portrayed, especially in the cosmic characters in 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and 'Thor'. It is a mixture of tribal society with extremely advanced technology that enchants the eyes of the audience.
The costume by Ruth E. Carter portrays very rudimentary African tribal clothing very well, bringing the difference in culture between the different tribes that make up Wakanda. The colorful and creative costumes manage to convey this concept of something more primitive and that contrasts so well with the technology of that nation. And this whole nation-building was incredibly orchestrated by Swede Ludwig Göransson, who knows how to thrill when necessary, increase tension at key points and showcase the culture of the people of Wakanda using drums, percussion instruments and tribal chants wisely. The costume, as well as all the construction of the language, habits and traditions of the Wakandians. It looks like a little bit of everything we've seen from African tribes, but at the same time it sounds new, with a certain freshness.
It is impossible to talk about this feature without mentioning the co-protagonists of the film - to call them supporting actors would be to reduce their importance in the plot. The king's personal guard, the Dora Milaje, commanded by Okoye (Danai Gurira), stands out, as does the entire female cast. Shuri (Letitia Wright) - sister of T'Challa - shows how much a Jarvis is out there on another continent and how much a Tony Stark can learn from his technological genius. Pantera's younger sister is equally important in comics - and has even taken on the official role of Black Panther in magazines - and here she is a true teenage genius. Nakia (Lupita N'yongo) is the most efficient and dangerous spy in Wakanda. We also have the power of Queen Mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett), predecessor of the Black Panther's courage, as well as a veteran priestess.
Villains have important roles. Ulysses Klaue, the Sonic Claw (Andy Serkis) - who had first appeared in 'Age of Ultron' - gains importance as a madly believable villain. Even a little cartoonish, his attitudes are anarchic and organized at the same time and his pretext calls into question the goodness of the Wakanda throne. Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) is a brilliant strategist and scientist who earned his PHD at MIT. He is also a skilled martial arts fighter, able to take on the best warriors in Wakanda, including the Black Panther in a fight that causes great twists and turns. Their motivations are completely credible. We also have with W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) - who, if at a moment passionately cheers for the king, rebels unexpectedly motivated by the failure to capture Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) by the Black Panther.
One of the points that were missing a little in the story, is a greater amount to the action scenes. We have great scenes filmed in Seoul, with a practically uncut sequence of fights in a clandestine casino and, of course, the chase scenes through the city streets. The scenes of fighting for the throne and the clashes of the last fifteen minutes are excellent and exciting. Visual effects play a fundamental role in creating Wakanda's look, however, in some scenes the not-so-effective use of effects is noticeable.<br/><br/>'Black Panther' is a cultural manifesto, unafraid to talk about racial and sexist issues in the US, past and present, while making an exciting and universal superhero blockbuster with a director and a mostly black cast , with themes of the black people and with several women as key pieces of history. A film that shows a closed society, but that from its new king, sees the need to build bridges with other nations, and not barriers, and that there is more that unites people than separates them. A politicized film, which has a more serious tone and uses humor punctually. Ryan Coogler manages to develop the characters and their interpersonal relationships and is competent in the action scenes. He uses and explores well the relationship between the real and the fantastic is not only in the mention of these real problems, but in the visual construction of the feature. In the end, there are still two post-credit scenes. The first gives clues as to what a 'Black Panther' sequence might look like and the second connects with the events of 'Captain America: Civil War."

She was fist pumping and remarking plenty on the characters and investing in all the Marvel silliness.<br/><br/>Points about radicalisation and nationalism are touched on, and it's great to see Wakanda as a nation similar to Africa if it hadn't been colonised. But the rest of the politics are shaky and the story and beats plain, and I still maintain that killing instead of uniting with Kilmonger feels like the wrong move.<br/><br/>It's a shaky film in parts and rereads a lot of old ground. But sometimes using simple and repeatable archetypes and moulds are important in the early stages of representation and inclusivity.<br/><br/>I'm confident that a bold Black Panther 2 could tell a new and important story with the same great characters."

As wakanda is having an identity crisis with their land full of powerfull space rock called vibranium so as after tragic circumstances forces young Prince T challah to assume the wakanda throne after the aftermath in civil war where the king was killed from the blast. But the character Killmonger is distant and in conflict with the other characters.<br/><br/>Erik Killmonger is based on his version in the comics (a Wakandan exile who seeks to overthrow his country), but incorporates elements of T'Shan (T'Challa's envious cousin) and the White Wolf (a relative of the Black Panther who becomes a villainous extremist and wears a Black Panther-styled habit).
The Prince has to face to ultimate test putting his fate of the country and the entire world at risk
But the prince's cousins with
Is greedy friend goes to Korea for to sell vibranium only for the young king to give chase finding them in a casino only to escape to follow them in a thrilling car chase and cgi special effects are stunning
. When two foes conspire to destroy Wakanda, the hero known as Black Panther must team up with C.I.A. agent Everett K. Ross and members of the Dora Milaje, Wakandan special forces, to prevent Wakanda from being dragged into a world war. To find the heart of wakanda
This shows the expansiveness of the mine and the symbolism of the Underground Railroad, which was designed to resemble heart valves for their fight for the heart of Wakanda.
As we saw the winter soldier in wakanda after cival war bucky is given the title of the White Wolf with a new arm. In the comics, the White Wolf was a white man who was adopted and raised in Wakanda; in the film, Bucky is not adopted but he is accepted by some Wakandan citizens.
. He is pitted against his own family the new king must rally his troops and release the full tech power of blank Panther to defeat his enemies and become an avenger and alsoThe Black Panther suit is upgraded in this film to bear mystic runes. This is based on the ""Doomwar"" storyline, where T'Challa developed magical tactics to not rely on his nation's resources of vibranium.
The Wakandan war cry ""Yibambe"" is Xhosa for ""hold strong"". Other possible translations include ""hold fast"" or just simply ""hold it""; all of these translations are appropriate for their situation. This chant was also briefly recited by Nakia and the River Tribe in Black Panther
Vala"" is Xhosa for ""close"" when the warriors activate their shields, as in close ranks
After the climactic battle scene, there is a quick shot of the elders' room. M'Baku is seen amongst the other tribe elders. This shows that T'Challa united all five tribes of Wakanda.
Believe the hype the cgi is amazing.

"ChocolatePrince","9","1","5","16 December 2019"," Black Panther
","Black Panther has become such a contentious issue on the internet. Many people seem to be butt-hurt that it got an Oscar nomination and most people find it overrated. I swear I sometimes think overblown media hype can ruin a perfectly good movie. And I want to preface my review by saying this: if you're white and you did not like the movie that's perfectly fine I do not think you're racist. And if you're black and you did not like the movie, I don't think you're an uncle tom. Yes, as a black man I enjoy seeing myself on-screen that's a given.<br/><br/>But I'm still going to talk about it as a movie because this is my review. I want to start with the positives: I love the world-building of Wakanda it's fascinating for me to see an African nation unfettered by European Imperialism. And Ryan Coogler gets a lot of mileage out of playing with the Afro futurism aspects of Wakanda. You get a sense that each African tribe in Wakanda has their own history and culture, which adds a lot of texture to the movie. On the character side, you have T'Challa and Suri who have a great dynamic as brother and sister.<br/><br/>Suri is essentially Black Panther's Q designing his gadgets for his various missions. The film also addresses the isolationism of Wakanda and T'Challa debates with his colleagues about whether Wakanda should open its borders to countries in need. In terms of the villain the film also shines with the character of Killmonger. Killmonger is essentially a tragic Magneto figure that's been twisted by racism and turned into a monster. And I appreciate that the film doesn't shy away from the systemic racism Killmonger endured in America. However, if I find any fault with the film is that Killmonger didn't get any kind of redemption arc, he's just vanquished like any other MCU villain and that's a shame. I would have love to see T'Challa and Killmonger as allies in the sequel. There's also some spotty CGI in the last battle between Black Panther and Killmonger. For the life of me, I don't understand how a 200 million dollar blockbuster has CGI that looks like a cut-scene from a PS2 game. But small quibbles aside, Black Panther is a remarkable achievement in cinema, it made a cultural statement and was entertaining at the same time which is no easy feat."

","Amazing, stunning, magnificent! Action scenes, acting chops (T'Challa, his sister, and his GF especially) were on point. FULL OF BADASSERY. Loved Martin Freeman's role too! Plenty of smart comic relief that made me BATMN. I dunno why I waited this long to see this! The story weaved a tale of the clash between the giving of service to the world VS the safety and security of one's own self, with a hero who had to overcome his own fears for his nation's safety and open his heart to the rest of the world, the outsiders who he didn't mind ignoring in the past. This really needs a sequel, though--for although he did what was right, there must be a tradeoff, and I didn't get to see the magnitude of the sacrifices yet (although I did get a taste of them) that are needed to flesh out the whole story."

","Black Panther is a superhero movie with great emotional depth. Deep themes and exciting action. Its puts the black panther on the map for bad ass superheroes.

Michael b Jordan does fine, his character is great but I dont think hes the best fit for a villian. The directing is the best highlight of the film, I am a big fan of Coogler and this helped his case even more so. Martin Freeman does great like always, and so does Danai Gurira and Boseman of course. Some jokes dont really work, but theres not really much else to complain about. The music is great too.

"bukharihassan36","8","1","5","18 February 2019"," Great movie. Suspicious Amount of 1 star ratings
","Overall, this movie was a good movie. It had a good plot, good story, and very likable and great characters. Is it overrated by the PC critics? I believe it is over-rated and that movies like Dark Knight are far superior. However, this movie had great CGI, interesting and historically archetype characters, and a great morality as well.
Wakanda was done very well and the fantasy city was beautiful. The characters and the ark of the story was very good (although relatively simple). It did remind me slightly of Lion King and that is a good thing. I love the contrast between the two major characters and their morality that is displayed. One has a negative upbringing and chooses the evil route, and one has a privileged upbringing and has more moral decency. I found myself rooting for the character with proper morality and how he displayed his belief in right and wrong even if he had to go against his own family.
The one thing I noticed regarding the reviews is just as some reviewers are complaining because the critics over hype of the movie, I can say that the amount of 1 star reviews are the reverse side of the perversion. On one side, the critics want to drool over the movie for political correctness, and others want to hate the movie without actually rationally considering the movie. I find it hard to believe that this movie would have garnered so many negative reviews if not for the publicity and political hype that has ended up surrounding this movie. In my opinion, this movie falls somewhere between 6-9 rating.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie was overall good. Good simple yet morally powerful story, and great CGI and backdrop to boot. While not the best superhero movie ever, still a significant and powerful one."

","I would never have expected for ""Black Panther"", out of all superheroes, to be so engaging and thought-provoking as this film was. Ryan Coogler is known for being a smart director, but here he completely breaks the usual scheme of simple, one-dimensional characters siding for good against evil and creates some of the most unique heroes ever made for the cinema screen. Killmonger, a barely known villain, is elevated to a complex personality, filled with rage and vengeance, and it's not unreasonable to actually understand his points. After all, he does nothing legally wrong, but he's overthrown for a supposed greater good. Now, this is what a great protagonist-antagonist interaction is about. 
Every actor gives their best, especially the lead, Boseman: the accent invented for Wakandans is so unique, and he manages to play beautifully with words through it.<br/><br/>On the cons notes, there still are a couple, which doesn't let ""Black Panther"" enter the masterpiece zone: 
1) The gags are forced, a problem many MCU movies share. Producers should understand that laughter is not a necessity all the time, and there can be a Marvel movie where the public just doesn't laugh. The result in a movie like this one is a huge cringe-effect when jokes are evidently juxtaposed for such goal. There are a couple decent ones, but they are exceptions.
2) The other problem virtually all Marvel movies share, the inevitable bombastic, over-predictable final fight. In particular, I found the CIA operative an uninspired addition to the cast in this section, as well as the sudden atonement of W'Kabi."

<ul><li>it is based on a comic book character;</li><li>it is in the Marvel universe;</li><li>it has a comic book cast and plot [read: big plot holes].</li></ul><br/><br/>It you went to see this, looking for the next Avengers blockbuster special effects, then you are early - that is coming out later this year. And so you would be somewhat disappointed: no aliens, no space ships, very human antagonist, yet all the normal comic book plot holes are there to see...<br/><br/>On the other hand, approached with an open mind, this was an interesting insight in to a very different world. You learn about the back story and character of the Black Panther, his weaknesses, his strengths and his commitment to his people. You see a messy aspect of his family history resolved. And then, too, you are exposed to a completely new culture - even though the Marvel view of African culture is as sanitised as civilian life in the big US cities, it is very much in that mold, with richness and depth and traditions on display or alluded to throughout.<br/><br/>Yes, there are plot gaps, some personalities are under developed, odd storylines start and stop a little randomly; the lighter tone and mix of humour is not for everyone either. So, that cost it a star in my eyes.<br/><br/>The film is visually stunning, approachable by families, brings considerable talent to the screen and is a thoroughly enjoyable step up from a pure action flick."
"thans-29315","7","1","5","4 April 2018"," Great Friday Night Movie
","I went to go this movie with my friends about 2 weeks ago. We had heard no bad reviews of the movie besides the occasional ""spite"" reviews, so I started to get some high expectations. I decided to just let myself see it through the eyes of just another comic book fan, and in that regard, it definitely succeeded. Cool fights, interesting characters, kinda the works for Marvel.<br/><br/>My biggest concern was the obvious political implications surrounding the movie. No one can deny this film definitely sparked controversy in that department, however, to the films credit, it was very legit. Aside from one line that I felt was a little gratuitous, it kept the politics strict to the story. Even the villain had an obviously horrifying plan that was recognized as psychopathic and induced mostly by trauma and the seething resentment he felt towards The Black Panther.<br/><br/>Outside of all that, the movie seemed mostly above average. It doesn't have the mass appeal that I thought it would have, and some scenes seem very lackluster. I also hate how they typecast Forest Whitaker!! Ever since his role as Saw Gurera in Rouge One, he seems to have the same demeanor and overall role here. A side character whose importance is only to move the main character towards they're so-called ""destiny"" only to die horribly half-way through the film!! He is a good actor, and I really wanna see someone give him some major role in a film one of these days.<br/><br/>Here's my end results for the film:
Story:7
Characters:8
CGI/special effects:7
Dialogue/script:7 (became kind of predictable)
Acting:9 (honestly my favorite thing about the movie)
Action:7"
"skyhawk77","6","1","5","28 March 2018"," Another After Earth
","These are the faults that i found<br/><br/>1. The basic plot is average or even below. The screenplay seems like it was rushed, not much time was put into writing it. Some of the technology is way over the top and seem like taken out of a James Bond movie. The Villain is not interesting or interesting. I did not understand the reason for the presence of some characters 
2. The fight scenes are not spectacular or anyway near that. One shot is broken several times. I expected somersaults and panther like moves but not much came. There is even some ufc style of combat which brings us back to the point above. If research was done The writers would have known of the folk wrestling done by the Serer people in Senegal
3. The Production design was not applicable to this movie. Yes the Wakandans were extremely technologically advanced but i failed to consistently notice the African feel as it was overshadowed by western designs
4. The score was too Western. I expected marimba and mbira type of instruments not the same old score<br/><br/>The good thing i noticed is the acting, the actors made the most of what they were given."
"tyroflakkripper","5","1","5","28 March 2018"," Bad? No. Spectacular? No.
","When the Black Panther was first seen in Captian America: Civil War, everyone was excited for the first African superhero. So when the film released to success and praise from most fans, the hype grew around the character. Obviously, when the trailer for the Black Panther was released, the hype grew to an unrealistic level. Depending on who you ask, the film either delivers on the hype or it did not. In this review I will talk about what I liked and what I didn't like about this film. <br/><br/>To begin with the things I liked, I will talk about Andy Serkis's character of Ulysses Klaue. In my opinion, Andy Serkis portrayed this villain better than almost any other villain in marvel behind the Vulture in Spider-Man: Homecoming and Loki in every other marvel movie. Klaues early death in this film was saddening to me but also a necessary development in the plot since even in death he progressed the plot on for Killmonger to get into Wakanda. <br/><br/>Second, I will talk about Killmonger, the second villain in the film. He is a villain with heart, which I can't say about most villains. He actually has depth and doesn't want to just destroy the world like most comic book villains. His intentions were good but were incrediblely stupid. I will talk about him a bit more later. <br/><br/>Last on the likes side, the costume and set design were phenomenal. Oscar worthy even. The extras were even good as extras. They weren't doing weird things. <br/><br/>On to the dislikes, I will start start with the plot. The plot is generic. It has been told before. I assume that everyone has heard of the plot type before. Establish hero, establish villain, villain travels to town/kingdom, villain challenges and appears to kill hero, villain shows he's evil, hero gets back and regains strength, hero kills or defeates the villain. This plot will stand the rest of time for how generic it is. <br/><br/>Killmonger is next on the list. Despite his good intentions, his ideas were incredibly stupid. Only in today's society would think that giving futuristic weapons to a group of people to let them fight there way out of trouble would be a good idea. <br/><br/>Overall this movie wasn't half bad. Was it new? Spectacular? Or even good? Not particularly. I consider this movie to be on the list of movies that arnt bad but have been made to many times before. Take Kingsman: The Golden Circle or The Hobbit Trilogy for example. Both are good movies. It suck if compared to there predecessors. <br/><br/>I give this film a solid 5/10 for not being good or bad. Just right there in the middle. It didn't live up to the hype, even a smaller margin of the hype wasn't achieved, in my opinion. But mainly, it didn't bring anything new to the table."
"archiez-71516","10","1","5","25 March 2018"," Excellent Movie - Grossing $1.2B
","Great Movie. Unbelievable cast, script, acting and directing. As at the time of writing, has shattered yet another milestone: It's now the top-grossing superhero film of all time in North America, ousting 2012's The Avengers to take the title. Globally, it's taken in more than $1.2 billion to date."
"jonathanbrown12","7","1","5","19 March 2018"," Good as stand alone
","If you are looking for an Avengers feel, wait for the Avengers: Infinity War.<br/><br/>I thought BP was a good stand alone film. Where it could have used a little time to build on a couple of characters' backstory, it was overall a good movie. <br/><br/>I'm not giving anything away: I do think the hype for this movie is a little overrated; I thoroughly enjoyed it in whole. I would title this movie the ""Tokyo Drift"" of Marvel (I really liked ""Tokyo Drift""). There are no super Marvel characters popping out of the blue; but does every movie really need that? Do we need to be reminded EVERY TIME that this is a Marvel movie? At this point in time (of the Avengers series), is T'Challa even an Avenger yet?<br/><br/>Don't go in expecting a normal Avengers feel. Go in to this movie with an open mind of a good stand alone (much better than Dr Strange)"
"HeatherHawkeye","8","1","5","19 March 2018"," Pretty good overall I guess...
","I seen the movie today and I thought that the storyline and the visuals were pretty amazing. I have a feeling I put pretty high expectations on it though because I thought that the storyline could have a little bit more feeling into it as for I am one that has never read the comics so I can only refer my knowledge to the movie. The technology they have in the movie was also pretty amazing things because it seems all out of this world. In general I thought this movie was pretty well made."

"ryanbartlett-870-746486","8","1","5","13 March 2018"," A Movie that May Define 2018 Landscape
","The first hit of the year. Starting 2018 off in a good way, Black Panther was able to continue the Marvel way, and provide a timely, fun, and thought provoking film. 
 Marvel has proven they will not back down from the current themes in the US. With the tensions and focus on inequality between race and gender building in the past few years, Black Panther has come out on the forefront of the movement, showing how powerful a movie can be, with an almost completely black cast, and a movie that really used women in prominent roles.
 Black Panther took us on a journey into a ""world"" never seen before. Showing us Wakanda, a land that has found itself right in the juxtaposition of modern and advanced civilization, with a very primal and ancestral culture. They played up this juxtaposition and then put it to the test. With the arrival of Michael B. Jordan, as Killmonger, they were forced to ask the question, ""what do we do, when we don't trust our leader?""
 In a culture, where you put your trust in your leader to protect you, this brought them into a new test of ""what does the future look like"" in the advancing times, and the changing atmospheres in both the movie and real life. The movie comes to the climax of moving forward.
 Played marvelously throughout, the cast played off of each other so well, expressing their turmoil in their own, personal ways, they each provided a unique view that drove the tense storyline. 
 This is definitely a movie that will continue the Marvel story line. Even though it really was a standalone movie, Black Panther will be a movie that will be remembered and one that may in the end, help to define 2018 in film."
"dxhpsu","10","1","5","10 March 2018"," Next great Marvel Super Hero movie
","Great cast, new and interesting story line.
I love the way the blow my mind. However, supporting roles done better than the lead. Great sound track, Kendrick Lamar nailed again, awesome special effects. I can't not ask for more, and so excited to see them again in the next The Avengers movie."
"theggbydealy","8","1","5","4 March 2018"," A full and honest review
","PROS 
1) A villainous villain? 
Killmonger was an interesting twist into what a villain was supposed to be. I felt conflicted as to who support because I understood why he felt this way. Growing up hard in Oakland meant that he wanted to see other people rise up, and he felt Wakanda wasn't doing much to help. This puts him in a grey area - not all bad, not all good. This is very good in my opinion, it wasn't a ""I want to destroy the world because I'm BAD!"" We actually understand his point and WHY he thinks the way he does, which makes his fights with T'Challa or the Black Panther much more compelling.
2) Wonderful symbolism
The fight scene where Black Panther is ""revived"" and causes a full blow out fight to happen: What a touching moment when Daniel Kaluuya (W'Kabi) lays down his sword. He doesn't keep on fighting: This is a message that Africans can only move forward when they work together, when they overcome differences. This is how Wakanda has made all their advances.<br/><br/>Black Panther buys the property at the end: Some reviewers on here weren't clear on this, but understand that this is the same town where Killmonger had grown up, where he experienced hardships. Therefore Black Panther bought all this property to give other children a better chance, to rise up as people. You could also see it as honoring Killmonger in a way. 
3) Great Score: I know some people didn't like the score, but I found it really nice. The African balance and Kendrick Lamar's songs were a really nice fit in the scenes. 
4) Funny lines: Letitia Wright's lines were really funny in my opinion. A really fun character, helping to bring contrast and break ice as Black Panther's character is very serious. <br/><br/>CONS 
Where's Killmonger?
1) Killmonger's screentime was, in my opinion, too short. It felt like we were only JUST introduced to him. He becomes King, fights then dies in a blink of an eye. I would have loved to see him be King of Wakanda for much longer, really see him carry out the roles as King and how he would do it, see who he WAS when he was in power. I feel like T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) came in too quickly.<br/><br/>2) Underdeveloped characters 
I felt as if the characters were not fleshed out enough. I have not watched the other movies with Black Panther in it, so I do not know if he was fleshed out there, and they simply continued his character expecting us to know what he was like. However, I felt as if he were all serious, and there wasn't much to his character. This goes the same for all other characters, even Killmonger. Yes, we knew his backstory as well, but it would have been nice if he was fleshed out a bit more. We know all the characters' morals, but WHO are they really? <br/><br/>3) Emotion? Emotion! 
We needed more gripping scenes. There were some hard hitting ones, but I did feel like some scenes were rushed. I did feel emotion in the scenes where I was supposed to, so that was an obvious plus, but if characters were more developed, then maybe this movie could have hit a goldmine with carrying a strong story, with strong characters, that ultimately gave more good, emotional scenes that could have really fleshed out the story.<br/><br/>SO, ANYWAY, HOW GOOD IS THE STORY?
Very well thought out story. As I said, it goes a bit to quickly in my opinion, with some characters like Black Panther's feeling a bit underdeveloped. However, the story is still a good one. I felt saddened with Killmonger as he saw his father die, when we found out his backstory. I laughed at scenes, and was saddened at others. The fight scenes are also very good, and above all, you understand the story. It is clear. If at some point we get a Black Panther 2, I'd like the story to have a bit more twists and turns - it felt a bit too clear cut and straightforward. <br/><br/>SO FINALLY, WHY AN 8/10?
The pros, in my opinion, far outweigh the cons, and I do think Black Panther is a strong and wonderful movie as it successfully balances seriousness and funniness, and I do think it stands on it's own two feet without a crutch. If anyone is wondering whether to see it or not, wonder no further. Book your cinema tickets and have a watch :)"

"lalexus-48524","9","1","5","22 February 2018"," Exactly What We Wanted
","I see many reviewers commenting on a lack of plot and character cohesiveness. I too found myself confused at some points, asking why, but any Marvel fan can fill in those holes for you. This movie left me pondering its memorable events and I love that. And in the context of the rest of the growing Marvel cinematic universe, it thoroughly connects Black Panther to the rest of the heroes. 
Some reviewers talk about their distaste for the cinematography and use of CGI. I say that this setting is supposed to appear surreal. Wakanda is supposed to be otherworldly. It is supposed to be much more advanced than whatever technology we can create now. I can say I didn't like a scene that went from very dark to bright, but otherwise, I felt fully immersed in this fantasy along with many of those I have asked as well. 
Some attempts at humor certainly lost me, but juxtaposed to commentary on nationalism and racism, I appreciated the script's attempts to relate to a contemporary audience. <br/><br/>Finally, I absolutely loved the soundtrack. At the most basic level, it is one of the most memorable for me. The music is unique yet appropriate for the context of current popular music. Beautiful and interesting polyrhythm and wonderfully appropriate timbres for different scenes of the movie."
"angelic_wounds","9","1","5","21 February 2018"," An origin movie that honours the original concept of the hero
","Critics have praised it, given it a perhaps unwarranted hype. Let's not forget that this still remains an origins story, which means that it is not a Hollywood re - shaping movie. Well, maybe not in the way most people expect. <br/><br/>-- THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS --
First of all, if you are a person who loved Guardians of the Galaxy 2, you might as well just skip ahead and don't watch this one. It is not goofy, it is not simple, it does actually have a good plot and a better script. I am sure you understand by now to what type of people I am referring to.<br/><br/>The movie sets right after the events of Captain America: Civil War, where t' Chakka, king of Wakanda, has been murdered in a terrorist attack. As the king, his children must take succession to the throne, a thing his elder son, T challa (aka the Black Panther) has been groomed and raised to take for years. All goes well, the traditions are carried throughout the obscure kingdom, and t' Challa successfully earns his place as the King. Wakanda survives off the technological advantages their most precious natural resource, vibranium, has given them, and the powers of the King himself. When, however, a notorious terrorist possesses some of the precious vibranium, and cooperates with a mysterious young man, who has a vindictive agenda of his own against Wakanda, the Black Panther must rise to the occasion, and prove to be a King unlike his predecessors, with the necessary sacrifices and changes to old traditions.<br/><br/>You can nitpick every little thing you want just to satisfy your craving to bash this movie. You may mock the accents, scoff at the socio-political cape of the movie, or claim that ""it wasn't as you expected it"". In the end, however, it remains as one of the most well rounded origin stories, similar to the first Spider Man and the Iron Man, with a simple yet carefully crafted story around a character who was born from the social injustice many wouldn't want to see in a heroic movie. Tough for you. Besides, while the racial differences may be the fuel behind the antagonist's actions, they do not gloss over the aspects of a Marvel film. The action sequences are very well choreographed. The soundtrack couldn't have been better, as Ludwig Goransson glorifies and honours traditional African music and songs. <br/><br/>Lastly, the cast itself is sublime, full of known and new actors who meld wonderfully to their characters, whether they are a traditional warrior or an outcast with a vengeance. Chadwick Boseman (t' challa/Black Panther) plays and moves well beyond his 40 years of age, and portrays emotion in a moving way when faced with tough decisions. Danai Gurira (Okoye) is an excellent ""Grace Jones"" lookalike in the form of a warrior, and she presents herself wonderfully in battle and in peace. Lupita Nyong'o (Nakia) gracefully graces Boseman's side and acts as the link to tradition and modern times, while Letitia Wright (Shuri) steals the show as the comic relief genius, who is ready to assist in anyway she can. Last but certainly not least, Michael B. Jordan (Erik Killmonger) gives a great dimension to an otherwise typical villain, and even though he follows the classic revenge scenario, he does so with a way and a persuading performance that you can't help but understand his motives and even support his way of thinking; his last scene is especially powerful.<br/><br/>It's not groundbreaking, certainly, but it's one of the best origin stories out there, offering an entertaining time as it crafts and moulds a nation and a character very different from the others, under an idea that could have easily escalated at the hands of another director. Ryan Coogler does not let the self righteousness drape over the core of this movie, and the result is a wonderful tribute to tradition, racial respect and the eternal message that hatred is never the way to go if you want to prove yourself right."
"Charicific","5","1","5","21 February 2018"," Definitely outshines some of the other Marvel movies.
","Black Panther is another great film in the Marvel universe, but I feel is a little out of touch with the Infinity War plot-line.
It has all the right points for an origin story but we are shown nothing new about the personality of the character that we didn't already get from Captain America: Civil War.
I really enjoyed performances from Letitia Wright and Michael B Jordan. And the set up and location of the film was great, they did a really good job of showing us Wakanda.
Definitely not one to miss out if you enjoy the Marvel franchise."
"themovieparadise","8","1","5","19 February 2018"," A Very Different Kind of Marvel Movie
","You would be hard pressed to find another 2018 film that has as much cultural and societal significance as Black Panther. A giant blockbuster comic book film, with a (nearly) all black cast, black writers, and a black director. If you have ever questioned whether representation on screen is truly important, just look at the philanthropic movements surrounding this movie. With the ""Black Panther Challenge"", money is being raised so that black youths--who could not afford to see it themselves--can go watch the film. The amount of love surrounding this movie almost matches the film's own innate messages, and it shows just how powerful the medium of film can be. This is exactly why movies are made. So while we take the time to discuss and analyze the film, it's important to have this preface of the significance of this movie, as that is far more important in the long run than all the tiny details and Easter Eggs Marvel fans will pick apart and debate. With that said, Black Panther is a really great movie. It personally is not in my top five Marvel Cinematic Universe movies like it is for some people, but it is a great film that stands out as being one of the more unique entries into the MCU, mainly due to Ryan Coogler's direction..."
"danw-36169","5","1","5","17 February 2018"," Another origin story
","Black Panther should be rated somewhere in the middle of the Marvel origin stories. I feel that as far as the origin stories go, they seem to follow a pattern that goes something like this: The top origins were funny, and serious, had action, interesting characters, smart dialogue and a decent story line. The worst were long, slow and little action or most of the action was at the end. I would suggest that ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Deadpool"" were tied for #1 as the best of the origins, while ""Thor"" and ""Fantastic 4"" were arguably two of the worst. The first ""Iron Man"" was somewhere near the top but ""Captain America"" was probably closer to the bottom. ""Wolverine's"" origins was probably somewhere in the middle, since people seem to love it or hate it. The rest are all sprinkled somewhere in between. (Sorry if I left some out and being true to the comic story line was not considered since that is a measure mostly for true comic book fans). Black Panther has a decent story line, good villains (but kill of a colorful one early), but is rather slow at times and is light on the action until the end. This movie has patterns of both the best and worst origin stories. It is not the best but it is certainly not the worst. It's somewhere in the middle.What is most unfortunate for those of us that really want to like this movie was the stupid levels of super-over-hype by the media and critics. ."

","This film defied the expectations of the superhero film. Intimate, yet grande. Personal yet universal. This film was fantastic and nearly without flaw. As usual a pro's and con's list.<br/><br/>Cons -<br/><br/>Ryan Coogler is inexperienced when it comes to CGI so it's acceptable that his first mega budget feature film would have some dodgy CGI and this really only comes into the third act.<br/><br/>The kiss between Nakia and T'Challa was iffy.<br/><br/>And literally that is it, everything else about this film was brilliant.<br/><br/>Pros -<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman is the King of Wakanda. He is brilliant, conflicted, nuanced and powerful both physically and emotionally. A King was born in Civil War and he has kept that title.<br/><br/>Michael B Jordan was also very good (though not as good as everyone has claimed) in his role. You understand his motives and his scenes with his father were seriously emotional.<br/><br/>Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira were impeccable as Nakia and Okoye. Both had great scenes, fantastic dialogue and it was great too see two powerful women of colour in leading roles.<br/><br/>Daniel Kaluuya and Winston Duke were also in respectable roles. Kaluuya working very well with what he was given and Duke rising through the scenes he shared with strong A listers.<br/><br/>Angela Bassett and Letita Wright were great as T'Challa's family. Bassett wasn't really given much to do but was very realistic within the more emotional scenes. Wright was also very entertaining to watch and the future implications for her character are very exciting. Yet another star is born.<br/><br/>Forest Whitaker, Sterling K Brown, John Kani, Seth Carr, Denzel Whitaker and Atandwa Kani were among my favourites. They all brought raw emotion, gravitas and pure empathy for their characters. Brilliant work.<br/><br/>Finally, Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman were given less to do but were solid within their roles. I just can't help but feel Serkis was a little wasted in the MCU but still nevertheless very entertaining and always fun to watch.<br/><br/>Side note it was great too see Alex R Hibbert (Little from Moonlight) in a small role.<br/><br/>Wakanda is so beautiful and glorious to watch as is the action that unfolds within.<br/><br/>The humour was perfect and in the right places. Very pleased it was not overbearing.<br/><br/>The opening was breathtaking and had me on edge.<br/><br/>Some of the dialogue such as Killmonger's final line were completely riveting.<br/><br/>The entire spiritual side of this film was so beautiful and emotional it was so glorious to see this side of a superhero and it made for some genuine raw emotion.<br/><br/>The costumes were brilliant as were the weapons and the cultural tribes of Wakanda.<br/><br/>The social commentary was the most important and honestly breathtaking parts of the film. The way it was current and fresh was just so right and Coogler has really made this film his own. The commentary on certain events just felt so right to include within this film.<br/><br/>Overall this film was just so damn good. The racial / social commentary was so relevant, the action sequences were so exciting, the cast are all on point and most importantly this film is both so intimate yet grande in regards to the MCU. The entire cast and of course Ryan Coogler should be commended for showcasing the beautiful world of Wakanda.<br/><br/>Wakanda Forever!"

","Firstly I've got to hand it to Marvel. They have not only created one of the most impressive shared universes ever established in cinema history but they consistently keep bringing quality movies to the masses year after year. Not all have been earth shattering masterpieces but almost all have been of above average quality and always entertaining. <br/><br/>Without beating around the bush, Black Panther is yet another great addition to this shared Marvel universe and has just enough character and style of its own to make it stand out from the others. <br/><br/>The element of Black Panther I absolutely loved was the overarching story and the motivations behind all the characters. Never have I been more closely connected with each and every character in a Marvel film as I did in this one. To fully understand why they were doing what they were doing and what was driving them. Refreshingly even the main villain had a genuine reason for his actions and at times even made me question why I was so against him and routing for the other guys. This mash-up of motives and emotions really set Black panther apart from the rest. <br/><br/>Not only that but the acting is of some of the highest quality there is. Stand out performance was Michael B. Jordan as Erik Killmonger. This guy just demanded your attention and completely owned every scene he was in. He balanced the dislike you felt for him perfectly and I found myself flitting from hatred to understanding numerous times throughout, by far one of my favourite villains in a Marvel film in a long time. Chadwick Boseman returns as the main protagonist after we first met him in 2016's Captain America Civil War and I was excited to see him again, although his performance didn't blow me away and he seemed to lack that special something that I get from the other MCU players. <br/><br/>Now I mentioned I loved the story and the message it brings with it however I did feel the plot itself was quite predictable and clichÃ©, there simply isn't all that much excitement to go around. No nerve in the core of the story, almost everything you expect to happen, happens. As great as the special effects are and as fun as some of the character scenes are, nothing is very memorable. There wasn't a single moment throughout the entire film that made me sit forward in my seat or really get my pulse going. To put it in context, I got that tingly excitement within the run time of the latest infinity war trailer, but not once through the 2h 14min runtime of Black Panther. <br/><br/>As mentioned in a few other Marvel origin stories, the lack of emotion from me as a viewer is possibly linked to the fact we already know T'Challa (Black Panther) will appear in the next movie and is likely to get a number of sequels of his own... No amount of death fake outs will have that emotional tug on me the creators are so desperately trying to make me feel. This is perhaps something impossible to avoid when you have a universe such as this but it undoubtedly takes away any kind of worry you may have for the main superhero. <br/><br/>One element the movie excels in is in its special effects. The majority of the film takes place in the fiction city of Wakanda and its mighty impressive, with its own unique mash-up of a technically advanced civilisation that still holds onto its ancient culture. The costumes, makeup, and excellent original soundtrack is something to behold. <br/><br/>So as the plot plays out rather passively with little in the shape of memorable moments, Black Panther does bring with it a wonderful message of a world coming together and touches on a number of things that are quite prominent in today's current political climate. Marvel should be applauded for bringing together such a rich and diverse cast and creating a wonderfully unique world within its ever expanding universe. It expertly manages to establish the soul of T'Challa, his moral standpoints and his capabilities, and sets him up perfectly going into Avengers Infinity War."
"mukool-hastak","8","3","33","16 February 2018"," Not bad at all; not great either; a solid movie nonetheless
","1. Overall: 8/10; Not as great as some of the rave reviews on imdb, but not bad at all. Good that the plotline is different to other Marvel solo movies which simply recycle Iron Man (like Ant Man or Dr Strange did). The plot is actually quite good and coherent.<br/><br/>2. Almost Isolated: Yes the only connection to the MCU comes in the post-credits scene where we see Bucky recovering. But, while it worked in this movie i hope th2 upcoming phase 4 movies are not all so isolated from each other. I personally liked the concept of MCU characters appearing in each others' movies and giving a real sense of continuity.<br/><br/>3. Klaue - Serkis: Wasted; in that they wasted a great actor on a character who is ultimately used as a pawn and eliminated early. Andy Serkis got waaaay less screen time than i would have liked.<br/><br/>4. Finally a relatable villain: Although he was tamed by T'Challa in the end; N'Jabanga (or wtv his name is) is actually a compelling character. Want to see more of that in the MCU"
"Darksidecrew","Null","2","18","15 February 2018"," non spoiler review of black panther
","Black Panther (2018, Ryan Coogler)<br/><br/>We first saw the African superhero 'Black Panther' in Captain America: Civil War and now we see him on his home turf and find out about the origins and history of the royal hero. The film itself is very afrocentric with a great and mostly black cast including Czhadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Forest Whitaker, Lupita Nyong'o and Angela Bassett as well as a a host of lesser known young talent. I was surprised to feel shades of a James Bond style adventure for the first act before it moved to something else but I did enjoy that while it lasted.<br/><br/>One of the many things I like about this film is the tone as it deals with some pretty relevant and serious racial subject matter with respect and class. Also, where as many of the more recent Marvel films have gone for a more slapstick and one-liners approach, this film uses a more natural humour that does not take you out of the film but enhances it. It has a strong script that fleshes out a lot of the characters and makes their motivations believable and clear even when in unbelievable settings. At no stage are anyone's actions leaving you scratching your head and it is the strength of the script, characters and acting that helps one overlook the films few shortcomings.<br/><br/>Where the film falters is in the action sequences and cgi. A lot of the special effects look unfinished or as if they might've been done ten or more years ago. The wardrobe design is excellent but some of the vehicle design could have been better. The worst offender for me though was the combat sequences which were often dark, overly edited and shaky. I was surprised at this because the director's boxing work on his film Creed (2015) was some of the best I have seen but here it was a mess. However the belief in the characters and what they are fighting for can still make you invested in these scenes despite their unpleasant presentation.<br/><br/>All in all, I think this was a home-run for Marvel, yet again doing a great job with one of their lesser known comic book properties. I expect this film to do big business world wide and should please most as it feels like a real film, with real characters and stakes and not just disposable popcorn entertainment. It is a shame some of the special effects feel so rushed but I guess deadlines have to be met to keep the MCU juggernaut moving along and quality control will suffer here and there.<br/><br/>7-7.5/10"
"Jumbajookiba","5","1","6","18 May 2020"," Very weak
","I love the MCU, but, there have been one or two movies that are much weaker than the rest; the first Captain America movie and The Incredible Hulk weren't that great and now add Black Panther.
It could have been so great, but, it lost me when we're told that it was hidden from the rest of the world. Pre spy satellite days you could have got away with that premise, but, not today. I was expecting them to explain how they have a shield over the main city to hide it from satellites, but, the writers clearly expected us to swallow the idea that it was not visible, for goodness sake, they can spot Kim Jong Un's train sitting on a siding in satellite photos. There was a total lack of logic regarding the premise of Wakanda being hidden from the rest of the world. By the way, Erik flew a plane into Wakanda without any problem, but, no else had done it before? Come on.
That aside, Chadwick Boseman is just so bland. I didn't warm to him in Civil War and I thought they could round out the character better in his own movie, I was wrong. The female characters were strong, which was one of the few pluses. The costume design was outstanding.
At the end of the day, it is entertaining, but, a best film Oscar nomination? No, especially considering movies like Thor:Ragnarok and Captain Marvel are many times better and not even got a hint of an Oscar nomination.
I'm not telling anyone not to watch it, but, don't listen to the professional critics as this time their praise for this movie was undeserved."

","See a lot of fake negative reviews written by some fake accounts that hate the movie giving it 1 or 2 stars rating just because for once you see a full cast of black people and whites dont like that. Whats even worse for whites is that in the movie the blacks are the tehcnologiccaly advanced people and the only white guy in the move plays the part/role that ussually the black guys have ( if you watched the movie, you know what i am talking about). Obviosult the fake accounts have been made to ""please"" some far right politician that wants to keep things the way thery are ( blacks and minorities are shit, white folks are the best).
Fake acocunts got better because they also pretend to analyze the movie and just give low rating for the actual film when the truth is that its amazing in every aspect and they hate it even more because its even worse for a white racist person to see that a film with black people can be so good so they try to criticize every aspect except the political message( when the truth is that tha's the thing they hate).
ALL I CAN SAY IS WATCH THE MOVIE AND APPRECIATE THE MANY POSITIVE MESSAGES ITS GIVING. ITS NOT JUST ENTERTAINING BUT ALSO EDUCATIVE.IM SORRY RACIST PEOPLE BUT TRUTH HURTS AND WE NOT ALL SO STUPID, WE KNOW EXACTLY WHY YOU HATING THIS MOVIE AND THATS WHY WE LOVE IT EVEN MORE."
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","9","1","6","8 March 2019"," A breath of fresh air in a stagnant genre of superhero films.
","Anymore, superhero films are a dime a dozen. I get that they're adding up to a greater narrative for Avengers: Infinity War (2018), but a lot of them seem almost indistinguishable from each other. Enter Black Panther (2018). Not only is this superhero not white, but almost all the action takes place somewhere other than New York City. There are a lot of strengths in Black Panther that make it feel like a cut above the rest. From the set design and aesthetic of Wakanda to the well-developed characters (including women warriors and women scientists), Black Panther shows how a superhero movie should be made.<br/><br/>Despite its strengths, there are still a few, minor weaknesses in this film. First, some of the CGI felt a little off in the sense that my mind rejected it when I saw it. These moments were usually pretty rare but were unquestionably obvious. Secondly, one of the tenets of the superhero genre is the action/fight sequences. While these sequences were present and exciting in Black Panther, often they seemed to be jittery and confusing to watch. Perhaps films like John Wick (2014) have spoiled me to the steady camera of a well-choreographed action sequence.<br/><br/>One of the best performances in Black Panther, which is why I think it should come so highly recommended, was that of Michael B. Jordan's antagonist, Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens. The strength of the African accouterments in this film was a cultural foundation that was offset by the oppression of African-Americans. This was made all the more evident by the antagonist's somewhat noble goal. I don't know if I've seen a more sympathetic villain, and it just made the conclusion feel like a richer sense of justice instead of just vanquishing an evil foe.<br/><br/>A breath of fresh air in a stagnant genre of superhero films, I give Black Panther 4.5 stars out of 5."

It's definitely not your typical Marvel movie. I usually spend some time playing games on my phone during superhero movies, but not this one. I liked that it was different, no stupid jokes, endless fights and similar. Think it's rather harsh to give it a 1, definitely not the worst movie of my life.
It's a movie about a different culture, with a different belief system, so of course it didn't meet everyone's expectations. I love that the fight between the good and the bad isn't that polarizing, and that it's not about who has more wealth and power. I love that it has strong female characters (that's what I expected to get from Wonder Woman, not the crap that we were served). I really hope that it will inspire some girls to follow their dreams, to be fearless, to be engineers... I love the visuals, the references to African culture. Love the soundtrack.

","I don't know if it's a game changer but it's amazing! There's no shortage of creativity as it's a 100% here. The story, action and characters are well developed. The only criticism I have is that the movie seems short and some of the effect aren't good.<br/><br/>T'Challa(Chadwick Boseman) becomes the new king of Wakanda after the death of his father. While struggling to be the next ruler and maintain the secrecy of his country he's helped by his tech savvy sister Shuri(Letitia Wright), former flame Nakia(Lupita Nyong'o), and bodyguard(Danai Gurira). If that's not enough a distant relative known as 'Kilmonger'(Michael B. Jordan) comes and also wants access to the throne in order to wage war on neighboring countries.<br/><br/>It's up to T'Challa and his allies to take on the mantle of Black Panther and put a stop to him once and for all. This's Marvel's first all black cast and it didn't disappoint. The characters are awesome to watch. They have well defined personalities and great chemistry. The villain has an understandable motive and while you don't agree with his methods you still sympathize with him.<br/><br/>The action scenes though short are still cool like in the scene where they fight in a South Korean casino. Its awesome! It's amazing to see how the suit works under combat. The effects are cool though some of them stand out like a sore thumb like in the final fight scene. Most of the CGI is cool while the rest isn't.<br/><br/>It's amazing how much hype this movie created and whether it delivered is debatable or not but I think what we got was a great movie. Don't take my word it's best if you see it for yourself."

"hrhein-64947","6","1","6","20 March 2018"," Average
","In a movie market where superheroes are dominating the scene, it is of little surprise that Disney's Marvel keeps producing new backstories to beloved superheroes. As someone that frequently continues to see the movies while they are still on the big screen, I am a fan of new heroes getting their share at they're own background story in order to further develop the Marvel franchise as a whole. I tend to enjoy single hero movies a bit more than the collaborations, as they tend to have more depth than the action packed, multi superhero movies; I am actually a huge fan of Captain America: The First Avenger. That being said, I was not the biggest fan of this movie. It had some jaw dropping visuals and some interesting sci fi tech that will hopefully be utilized heavily in Infinity War, but it did not have much beyond that. The overarching story line is not terrible, but it isn't great. The what was thought to be the main villain is killed about half way through and has very little depth. The man that kills him happens to be a kid that witnessed the aftermath of the King killing his brother and spent his whole life seeking revenge. Cliche much? One of the best parts of superhero stories is that their counterpart villain is just as interesting as the hero itself, the main villain in this story was relatively boring and came as a ""shock"" that was not really much of a shock. Most of this stories ""twists"" were easily predictable and hit on a ton of cliches. While this makes for a shallow, relatively boring story, it does not make for a bad movie in whole. Overall, it was simply average. It is not the worst Marvel movie I have seen, but it is certainly not the best. Hopefully Infinity War is leaps and bounds greater than this. Would recommend seeing after it comes out of theaters, probably will add it to my collection. Average."

","To be honest the hype got to me a little when walking into this movie and after watching it, I can say it doesn't totally live up to it. Don't get me wrong it's a well made movie but just like some Marvel movies in the past it doesn't do anything new. Sure it shows off African culture but other than that it is still the same film we've seen over and over again. What I do like about this movie is how character driven it is as opposed to just being filled with action scene after action scene. The characters are pretty good for the most part however I did feel that Black Panther himself was probably the most boring which is a shame because he was so great in Civil War. All the actors do a good job and I never felt like anyone stood out in terms of bad performances except for Michael B. Jordan who seemed to phone it in some times. A lot of the problems in this movie are due to inconsistencies. For the sake of not spoiling anything an example I would use are the special effects which range from good to downright terrible. In the end Black Panther is a character driven film with beautiful scenery, good characters, and great acting but the story isn't anything new and there are some major inconsistencies."

I've always thought T'Challa was a great character with an interesting background and an interesting plot line. The land of Wakanda and the King and it's people all had struggles of their own and it seemed like a great starting for a full-length feature about the Black Panther's world.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the magic that I had hoped for was lost along the way. The story line was acceptable but the character of Killmonger was flat and not interesting at all. The acting overall was decent but some of the support cast wasn't up to par. As this is a superhero movie I would have rather it stayed away from being preachy even in the slightest. This isn't a sweeping historical drama, this is an action movie. Or so it should have been. The CGI was good in some parts but not in others. The fight at the end between T'Challa and Killmonger when they both had on their suits looked like they were made of rubber. I do not care for political correctness being in superhero movies and wish they could have just let it be a fun and entertaining movie solely. Ultimately disappointing."

","Feels like a Shakespearean play and this is why the film works so well. It has a great story and one of the best screenplays Marvel has ever prodded. It offers a strong story with many interesting characters, mixes this with great action scenes and delivers a great visuality in general.
The only thing that could have been better was the acting. Why everybody was solid nobody really was at the top of their game. I guess that is still something Marvel has to learn, now that they stat to produce great screenplays. Again, dont get me wrong, Chadwick Boseman was great in the leading role but I felt that his co stars Lupita Nyong'o and especially Michael B. Jordan were there and just did their thing without much passion. I also thought Forest Whitaker once again adds an overacting credit to his resume, which is a shame. Angela Bassett was good and I really liked Martin Freeman and Danai Gurira. Andy Serkis also made a decent villain.
Daniel Kaluuya also doesnt really live up to his recent Oscar nomination and I felt the performance of Letitia Wright was a bit off. But other than that it is close to a masterpiece. Besides the great screenplay it has a fantastic direction by Ryan Coogler and many nice twists. I really liked the mythology it created and look forward to many more visits to Wakanda."
"sspina","8","1","6","5 March 2018"," Best Marvel Film since Winter Soldier
","I saw Black Panther yesterday, having not seen any trailers and not really knowing much about it, and I absolutely loved it! I've been a little disappointed with most of the recent Marvel films so I wasn't sure what I'd think of this one but I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Black Panther follows the story of King T'Challa of Wakanda, a hidden African nation filled with advanced technology, and his battle to protect his country.<br/><br/>This film was obviously a huge step forward in diversity. The cast is mostly black and the women are refreshingly not stereotypical and not over sexualised. It's so nice to see women portrayed as smart, political, and strong but with complex emotions and ambitions rather than being portrayed simply as the romantic interest or the warrior.<br/><br/>I thought that the story was brilliant. In the past, Marvel has not shied away from making political statements in their films and this was no different. There were moments that moved me to tears, the characters were likeable and well-developed, and the plot was clever, believable and well paced. <br/><br/>The visuals in this film were absolutely stunning. The use of colour, in particular, really helped to establish the beauty of the country of Wakanda. The costumes were vibrant and the special effects were amazing.<br/><br/>It did have a bit of a different feel to a lot of the Marvel films. This was potentially due, in part, to the fact that it was mostly separate from the previously established world of The Avengers. Most of the recent Marvel films have included cameos of various members of The Avengers or other well-established Marvel characters whereas Black Panther did not. Since T'Challa had already been introduced in Civil War, there was no need to connect this too strongly with The Avengers. To me it felt enough like it was part of the univere but a little secluded, like Wakanda.<br/><br/>My only real issue with Black Panther was that the humour fell a little flat. It felt like an awkward dad trying to be ""down with the kids"". This was particularly disappointing as Marvel films often have the perfect balance of action, emotion and comedy whereas it just didn't work in this film. <br/><br/>Overall though I immediately fell in love with this film and I cannot wait to see how it links in to the rest of the Marvel universe in Avengers: Infinity War."

","When I saw Black Panther in ""Civil War,"" I seriously hoped he'd appear again, and when I heard they were making a film about him, I was thrilled. The glowing reviews added to my excitement. The pluses are that the villain has a rational reason to want revenge, and he wants to stop the oppression of black people. (Sure, he wants to trigger a global race war, but nobody's perfect.) So the plot revolves around real-world issues, not some abstract Nyah-hah-hah take-over-the-world scheme. But the basic premise is preposterous, that you can hide a nation more technically advanced than anyone else behind an invisibility cloak. Where does Wakanda get all its scientific and technological expertise? If students go abroad, doesn't anyone wonder why there are all these exchange students from a dirt-poor country, or what happens to them? And even if Wakanda can cloak itself now, how did it keep its first steam engines secret? And the finale involves a chaotic set-piece battle royale like in ""Civil War,"" again with nobody appearing even to get a skinned knee. Finally, I think they missed an opportunity by killing off Killmonger. In his final scene, he looked like he might be open to redemption. They could have done a lot with him as a flawed but slowly maturing hero."

I wanted to hate the movie because of all the BS hype and political correctness baloney, but after sitting through the first ten minute with a scowl and crossed arms, I ended up really enjoying it. It is a fun and exciting superhero adventure."

","The Marvel Studios superhero movie, Black Panther, has gleaned a lot of hype and praise as being not just good, but something really different. I think the movie mostly lives up to that praise, but I view its specialness as being not so much in being ""different,"" as in ""finally getting it right.""<br/><br/>The movie works on two levels. The first is as a dramatic piece in the thriller genre. Secondly, and more important, it works as an artistic and social watershed. It is a ""black movie"" in the way that movies should have long since portrayed black people and their experience in western civilization. It seems that the best rebuke to the ""white man's burden"" concept comes from a superhero movie.<br/><br/>First, this is a good, action-packed, thriller movie. It has all the requirements of the thriller genre-a strong protagonist fighting long odds and supported by heroic friends against an equally strong antagonist. The dramatic tension is primarily from the contest between protag and antag, with large doses of physical battles in carrying out the plot. It even has a bit of a ""macguffin"" thrown in (the vibranium). There's all the spills and chills with fast-paced action of a Marvel superhero movie, but it's done well in that the action is not ""over the top"" (e.g., Thor Ragnarok). Also, the script doesn't indulge in the irritating fad of tongue-in-cheek ""humor"" (also e.g., Thor Ragnarok). I mean the characters operate within the constraints of the fiction's universe and they take it seriously. There is humor, but it doesn't pull the viewer out of the dramatic experience.<br/><br/>The characters and situations are taken from the Marvel comics, but the storyline is pretty much basic thriller. I'm OK with such genre fiction when it's done well, and it is with this movie. The action is thrilling with very good SFX and CGI. The plotline keeps the tension up with enough complications to keep it from being predictable (up to a point). I liked that the Black Panther costume wasn't so ""mechanized"" as many of the superhero costumes are. It is closer to the ""non-tech"" costuming of the comics rather than the militaristic ""armor"" so many of the superhero costumes have become in their movie representations. That aspect emphasizes the hero's superness rather than the costume.<br/><br/>Now, I think that good characterizations take a thriller story to a higher level. That's especially true in a superhero movie, where you run the risk of making a kid's movie and putting off the adults. Ryan Coogler (writer and director) is successful in that regard, and more. T'Challa is sufficiently strong, though with weaknesses, and moral enough to fight for justice against villains who are either morally depraved (Klaue) or misguided-dysfunctional (Killmonger). So its easy to pull for T'Challa. <br/><br/>Casting was well done. Chadwick Boseman brings out the right blend of strength, intelligence, and moral fiber in T'Challa/Black Panther. Michael B. Jordan plays, Killmonger, T'Challa's chief rival with a range from street punk to bad a-s , to tragic figure. He seems to be a capable actor so I expect we'll see more of him. A couple of venerable actors lent some class and gravitas to the story. One is Forest Whitaker as Zuri, and the other is Angela Bassett as Queen Ramonda. Martin Freeman is CIA agent, Everett Ross, who is a sympathetic helper character. Freeman is a Brit playing his character with an American accent. He does it well and that seems to be the current fad. I had my biggest problem with Freeman's character. For having such an anti-colonial theme, here is a CIA agent as the protagonist's friend and significant helper. Well, I guess this is based on a comic book.<br/><br/>While on the subject of the cast, I have to mention Andy Serkis, who has finally played a role that is not CGI or in heavy makeup. He plays the baddie, Klaue, and apparently bulked up for the part. Bless his heart. He'll always be Gollum to me.<br/><br/>On the higher level, this movie breaks significant ground for African-Americans. The characters are mostly African-American and the story is told from the ""black African"" viewpoint. Without condescension or insulting stereotyping, the movie presents a story of black people as people-real people, as good and bad and nuanced as all human beings are. This has not really been done well before. Not even in such classics as the 1970s' Roots series. It is in keeping with Stan Lee's vision and it just excels over the what Hollywood has done in the past. Even so, it breaks that barrier, though just barely.<br/><br/>For example, there is a strong anti-colonial theme in the movie. To protect itself and the vibranium element that empowers it, the nation of Wakanda hides itself behind a cloak of ""normal"" third world poverty. When we see the real Wakanda, we see the level of development that African nations should have attained, if not for the imperialism of the west (ongoing today). This seen in the white characters expressing disdain for African ""savages,"" and in the deriding term of ""colonist"" being applied to the white CIA agent (appropriately!). This theme is subtle, however, and I don't know how many younger viewers will catch it. Not many, I suspect.<br/><br/>This movie is Heart of Darkness turned around. Probably, kudos for that should go to both Stan Lee and Ryan Coogler. They've made, not just a superhero story with an African protagonist, but something important in the history of socially-charged drama."
"mrithunjayan","9","1","6","3 March 2018"," Black Panther - Unlimited Imagination!!!
","Article contains spoilers!!!<br/><br/>It's been a while since I went for a movie and the release of the last Marvel movie before the big release of the final chapter in Avengers - Black Panther - is a great reason for a movie night.<br/><br/>Usually, I watch a movie with few expectations based on the trailer or teaser, however, Black Panther is a one off case. I didn't watch the trailer but just was following up on the release of the movie. <br/><br/>Right from the beginning, the tone of the movie was set as slow and dark and it is evident that it is not going to be a run of the mill super hero movie. In my view, Chadwick Boseman is the perfect fit for the role of Black Panther. Yes, you might have seen him in action in Civil War, but, when you watch this movie, you will also accept what I just said - Puhfut fit for the role!!!<br/><br/>The antagonist Micheal B Jordan, is also a perfect match to the role and I always believe that any movie will be great success if the antagonist has a meaty character and performs well.<br/><br/>Since the movie is an adaptation of a comic book, the imagination of the director is unlimited. Be it the technology, weapons, vehicles - the movie showcases unimaginable concepts that are weaved into the screenplay to look believable. Kudos to the screenplay writer(s) who have ensured to show the mixture of advanced technology + the cultural diversities among people. The story-line is pretty much simple, one you would have seen it in multiple movies and whatever the director thought would create a surprise never really was there. In-fact, we were able to guess the next scene or sequence without much of a problem. But, as I usually say, guessing a sequence is easy but looking at the way it is conceptualized and taken to the big screen deserves an applause.<br/><br/>One of the negatives that I felt about the movie is that many action sequences lacked clarity, especially the initial sequences - introduction of the Black Panther - was too dark. Also, the climax sequence - could have been a lot clearer if the action would have taken place elsewhere, just my thought.<br/><br/>However, being an adaptation from a comic book, you just have to sit back and enjoy the movie and do not try to defy logic. There is no room for any logic in any super hero movie and it applies same to Black Panther as well. That's why, I have titled this article as Unlimited Imagination and I am sure after watching the movie, you will also agree to my view.<br/><br/>Overall, on a Friday night, after a hectic week (be it at work or school), you can definitely watch Black Panther and enjoy the 140+ mins of Wakanda!!!"
"samwamburi","9","1","6","1 March 2018"," The greatness lies beyond the movie's end..
","The greatness of the Black Panther movie is in what it makes you feel for your culture as an African, especially the potential for greatness, long after the the credits are done. 
It won't go down as the best CGI manipulated movie or best action sequence, not even greatest acting in the Marvel jaggernaut. However what this movie has done that the others have failed is to lend a cultural vibrance and a sense of belonging, especially to Africans in our homeland (I'm from Kenya), and to see the greatness of our continent if it's resources were harnessed and used well. Yes it has political undertones, anti-colonial sentiment which of course triggers the race debate (which is where I suspect many reviewers got salty), but that's the point of BP. Of you read about his character as well from the comic books, he isn't a ""fit"" in the Avengers and has always been suspicious of the rest, as his first priority is protecting Wakanda.
So, anyine watching this expecting just wham, bam and cheesy, predictable plots with no undertones, this isn't for you. <br/><br/>9/10 movie for me."
"amerbajramovic","8","1","6","28 February 2018"," See it for yourself. You might be intrigued.
","The first thing I want to mention right on start is that anyone now wishing to go in cinema and watch it, shouldn't read reviews because I did it and almost quit going. I would make a big mistake. My note is a proof.
I watched it in 2D and that was my second mistake, other then listening to a reviews. Beautiful CGI, amazing fight scenes, lighting... just every visual aspect is a proper 3D material. Totally recommended. 
I saw a lot of comments of how movie was over-hyped and now I wonder, do we now review trailers or movies. If a trailer (which I intentionally didn't watch) is a bit wealthy with scenes, why would everyone go super strict with a movie. Watch it like you never even saw a trailer, I say.
Now the technicalities. Almost everything you would except from a Marvel movie was there. Interesting story, hero that is kinda mythical kinda technological (like fusion of Iron man and Captain America), amazing side characters, beautiful background story which is also beautifully told, landscapes, soundtrack, a touch of humor but not too much like in Ragnarok... ALMOST everything. 
One thing we really lacked was a true villain! A bit of evil, more arrogance, brutality, blood. We lacked a bit of conflict as well. Not a movie conflict because we had a whole lot of fighting but that theatrical conflict between protagonist and antagonist. 
One more, minor-ish complain is that some scenes, some tribe-related scenes, could be done with more usage of a native language. With just a few more even minor mistakes that are not even worth mentioning, I have to say I really enjoyed discovering Wakanda and watching Black Panther. And as I said, see it for yourself!"
"maxigarciasoto","8","1","6","1 March 2018"," Black Panther - Movie review
","""Black Panther"" is a movie that i was really anticipating. I had waited for this film since i saw for the first time ""Captain America: Civil War"" two years ago. When that movie came out everyone was talking about the great things in ""Civil War"", and one of those great things about that film was Chadwick Boseman's performance as Black Panther. I was incredible in that role and he kept me invested in his character. But i had this question inside my head: Will he hold up for an entire film by himself? - And two years later i have an answer for that question, and the answer is yes.<br/><br/>This movie is about T'Challa AKA Black Panther and he is about to become the king of his nation, Wakanda. And while this is happening a group of villains involving Michael B. Jordan and Andy Serkis are doing evil stuff and T'Challa has to stop them. This is the only thing that i going to say about the plot of this movie, because this movie is worth seeing.<br/><br/>This film was everything i wanted to see in a ""Black Panther"" movie and more. I like the fact that this movie is not just another super-hero movie, is actually a movie about a person becoming the king of a nation and the difficult task that he has to do. The film took the enough time to set up very well Wakanda, Wakanda's culture, and the importance of becoming a king. And that feeling that this film has, it makes you care more about the characters. You care about them when they are in danger, and there are a lot of moments were you wonder if they could actually succeed in what they are doing. This movie puts in your mind the question: Will this character survive? - Is really T'Challa the best king for Wakanda right now?<br/><br/>Talking about T'Challa, Chadwick Boseman once again killed it as Black Panther. He was a very cool hero, but he wasn't just a cool hero, he was actually a person that you can relate to. The writing for him was so good and that combined with Boseman's performance, makes Black Panther a really great hero. The cast of this film is excellent, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis, Forest Whitaker, Daniel Kaluuya, Martin Freeman, Danai Gurira, everyone is fantastic. I didn't mentioned this actor because i wanted to talk about him separately from the other ones, Michael B. Jordan. He was so good in this movie, he is a great villain and his motivation is so clear, that he might be the best Marvel villain since Loki, i'm serious.<br/><br/>This movie is being directed by Ryan Coogler, who in the past has made incredible films like ""Creed"", proves himself here that he is one the best young directors working today. There are a lot of shots and long takes at Wakanda, and is magnificent to see.<br/><br/>That leads to my negatives with the film, Ryan Coogler directed this movie incredibly, but i think that he has to learn how to film action sequences better. The action sequences in this film are fine, there are really great action sequences in this movie, but there are action sequences like the first one at the beginning of the movie, that are kind of bad. That first action sequence is edited very quickly and is very dark and you can barely see it, which kind of annoy me. Another issue that i have with the film is this. The visual effects in this film, for the majority of it, are very good, but there are some scenes were you can really notice the use of green or blue screen behind the actors. And that took me out of the movie in a couple scenes.<br/><br/>""Black Panther"" was a very entertaining film, Marvel has made another great super hero movie. It has great action, great characters, excellent villains, it show us a new side of the MCU. The origins of Wakanda and the Black Panther mantle is explained very well so everyone can understand it. If you are a great Black Panther fan, or just a big fan of comic book movies, this movie is absolutely recommendable for you. It has a couple issues with the way the action is filmed and some CGI background that looked fake, but for the most part this movie was very entertaining and i want to see it again. ""Black Panther"" deserves an 8/10."
"prasutheinvincible","10","1","6","23 February 2018"," Masterpiece
","This is the best movie ever made by marvel. Ryan Coogler's masterful superhero drama is unlike any other, featuring outstanding acting, breathtaking art direction, fascinating royal intrigue, memorable action sequences, and surprising depth. It's that depth -- of character, of storyline, of relevancy -- that makes Black Panther shine, as Boseman's T'Challa takes the mantle of king with enormous uncertainty about whether to share Wakanda's resources with the world. With the exception of his second-in-command W'Kabi (Kaluuya), T'Challa surrounds himself with an inner circle of influential women: Okoye, Nakia, his mother (Bassett), and his genius younger sister, scientist/tech inventor Shuri (Letitia Wright). Each of them contributes much to the story, with Gurira's spear-wielding Okoye the movie's clear scene-stealer, Wright the clever comic relief, and Nyong'o offering a wee bit of romance. Even the central villain, as played by frequent Coogler collaborator Jordan, is well-rounded and humanized, with the actor doing great work opposite the equally nuanced Boseman.<br/><br/>There's so much to appreciate in Black Panther, from its pulsing score, which features a soundtrack overseen by award-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar, to the mesmerizing cinematography courtesy of DP Rachel Morrison, gorgeous tribal costumes, and vibrant production design. There's not as much laugh-aloud banter as viewers may have come to expect from Marvel movies, but the beats of humor that are here, usually thanks to plucky Shuri or mountain-tribe leader M'Baku (Winston Duke), are extra funny. Ultimately the film's success comes down to the thoughtful, compelling storytelling from director Coogler and writer Joe Robert Cole, as interpreted by a terrific cast of actors. This isn't just another highly entertaining but formulaic superhero story; it's also poignant and powerful and earns its place toward the top of Marvel's films. (Be sure to watch all the way through the credits for a couple of extra tidbits!)"

"gcsman","8","1","6","22 February 2018"," ""Do you know what I call them?... sneakers!""
","The best superhero films of all (no particular order) are X-Men United, Iron Man (I), Thor (I), The Avengers (I), and Wonder Woman. Does Black Panther join that list? Maybe. It's hard to argue with the rave success it's having with audiences in theaters all over Africa, who are finally seeing themselves represented on screen. So bravo to that. I give this a solid 8/10 but if anyone wants to give this a 10/10 for its cultural impact alone, fine. (A personal footnote: I don't ever see myself ""represented"" in any superhero film characters at all, so in a sense I can feel free to identify with whoever I want. The closest I would come would probably be Hank Pym or Doctor Strange, but even those are bit of a stretch.)<br/><br/>I like to look at the demographic breakdown of the IMDb rankings and in this case it's interesting that women rate it notably higher than men, in all age groups. Is the reason as simple as that there are so many very active female supporting characters? Those characters are good -- I thought Letitia Wright's portrayal of young Shuri was the most interesting role of the whole works. As the hero, Chadwick Boseman is kind of stuck being required to be noble and honorable all the time, so he's a little one-dimensional. But, I can't avoid pointing out that supporting characters aside, all the head honchos in this movie are still male. That's why Wonder Woman still stands alone, and why I'm looking forward to Captain Marvel (and even Black Widow if that does get made). <br/><br/>It's a fine ensemble cast and they are all nicely invested in their characters. It was fun to listen to the Xhosa-accented English from the Wakandans throughout the film -- you get so used to it that when Eric Killmonger drops in with his Los Angeles-street accent (that we would normally be quite used to hearing) it actually jars. It's clear that this guy doesn't fit in and has to be removed as quickly as possible. Wakandan origin or not, he's beyond saving. For the rest of it, Marvel pulls off its normal excellent production values, and the action, scenery, backdrops, and special effects all have a high-gloss richness and texture that you associate (e.g.) with Steven Spielberg at his best. (The bright African sunlight doesn't hurt the colorful cinematography either.) One thing that I couldn't quite buy into was the Wakanda setting itself where we see traditional rural agrarian tribal life put right up against this futurist techno-ShangriLa. if their society is really this advanced, then why in heck do they choose a king by holding a primitive, brutal hand-to-hand combat ritual? Really, they need to get rid of that .... And the armored rhinos kind of went over the top for me. <br/><br/>The on-screen Black Panther here and his techno-marvel suit are a powerful step up from what the character did in the actual comics, though I was never particularly interested in the BP character back then -- he seemed too much like Spidey or Captain America. In the movie MCU, however, they seem to have decided to make BP a major player in the whole greater story in which this is one more building block. <br/><br/>After I left the theater I realized that BP felt quite a bit like a good James Bond film -- it zips around to multinational settings,it never lags, it gets through a lot of plot, and it gives you lots to look at for your money. I see that some writers give BP credit for 'discussing' world issues like immigration and the responsibilities of advanced nations to help others, but it seems like those kinds of things were just raised rather than really tackled. Can't have it all.<br/><br/>On to Infinity War."
"rony-07065","10","1","6","22 February 2018"," As Advertised
","Great movie, action, comedy, politics, messages, totally different from most Marvel movies. For one, we're used to seeing white super heroes. For once, Marvel showed the world that white people aren't the only ones that can be ""super."" <br/><br/>I read one review where the guy said....""it was unrealistic.... how can a woman beat up men twice her size?"" Really... did you ask that same question when Widow was taking 2-3 men down her size in Civil War? For the record, Widow is much smaller (and shorter) than Okoye. <br/><br/>I loved the fact that it wasn't overly comical. Marvel had dipped too much into the comedy pool in Thor Ragnorok and other various movies. This time, they were subtle with it. Not over the top trying to press it too much. <br/><br/>I loved the fact that they showed black people prior to colonization. Before white people came into the country and changed it forever. It gave us a snapshot of what life was like (minus the sci-fi aspects). The tribal traditions, respect, honor, loyalty. So many times blacks are depicted as disloyal, gang bangers, drug dealers, ghetto, uneducated, slaves or basketball players. They are much more and this movie showed us that. I believe those who couldn't grasp the concept gave the movie a low rating because they were looking for what we see in white driven Marvel movies. This movie needed to set itself a part from those movies. <br/><br/>The movie did have it's flaws.. but what movie doesn't? A 1 out of 10 even on a bad day this movie is not. Those who rated it that way seem to be a bit misguided in their critique. Saying it's the worse Marvel movie when you have the first Hulk sitting out there, Elektra,Both Fantastic 4 movies,Daredevil, Ghost Rider, Punisher, and a few others... saying this is the worse says you probably don't know much about movies or you have an agenda with your rating. <br/><br/>I love the score, it was on point, not overbearing, and full of drums. If you never knew anything about tribes, they use a lot of drums! I saw someone on here complaining about the drums. <br/><br/>Lastly, Marvel movies have NEVER been known for their great plots or well defined characters. They are action sci-fi movies with a taste of drama and suspense. I don't expect an academy award for any of them or the actors/actresses. Neither should any of us. <br/><br/>This movie did what it was supposed to do... entertain, give us something new, and lead us into the Infinity War. It did that."
"jhdw","9","1","6","21 February 2018"," Not surprised by some of the reviews
","So, let's begin. As a black man, I'm proud to see a film that took on the challenge of a complex character, with a black director, black cast and black soundtrack production(excluding Surkis' mixtape). It was unprecedented but more importantly...... about time. Now granted at the end of the day this is a comic book movie. As a first go run for BP, i won't whine like other reviewers who claim that this was nothing major. Captain America: The First Avenger was nothing to shout about BUT it, just as BP, was a build up movie. It gave us history of a character and a country that looked something out of Star Wars. <br/><br/>I also liked that the movie attempted to highlight social issues. Wakanda has had advanced technology for centuries but chose to do nothing about slavery, euro/asian colonization of Africa, apartheid, rape of Africa's resources...the list goes on. It just touches the surface of it and surprisingly, Killmonger and N'jobu did an amazing job bringing that to light. <br/><br/>Also, I don't know if Coogler meant to do this on purpose but the way the world views Wakanda feels similar to what I've experienced as far as racism. Klaw views Wakandans as ""savages who don't deserve vibranum"". The asian lady in Korea who looked at Nakia the same way I'm sure Soon Ja Du looked at Latasha Harlins before murdering her in 1992 which was a precursor for the LA Riots. The way the female SHIELD agent looked at TChalla and Okoye with disgust outside of the interrogation room. Or even the UN delegate's disrespectful tone towards T'Challa by saying ""wtf assistance could your sh*thole country possibly offer the world"". These subtle tones of racism just had me going ""yep, me too"" in the theater.<br/><br/>But even if you couldn't relate to the movie you have to admit it's still good. Not the best comic book movie ever made but definitely top 5. I've seen it twice already and might go a 3rd. Can't wait to see what they do for BP 2. They've introduced too many other interesting characters for there not to be other films. Hopefully Coogler will be directing that as well."
"lam-bui","9","1","6","21 February 2018"," Not your typical Marvel movie
","Black Panther starts off right after the events of Captain America: Civil War. King T'chaka (John Kani) is killed in a terrorist attack and his son T'challa (Chadwick Boseman) is about to take over his mantle as king of Wakanda. Everything changes when old Wakandan foe Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and newcomer Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) are threatening to steal Wakandan resources (Vibranium, the strongest metal on earth) and expose the country for what it truly is: the richest and most technologically advanced country in the world. <br/><br/>The movie bears the title of a Marvel movie, but it doesn't feel like a Marvel movie for the most part. In this case it works in the benefit of the movie. The thing about Marvel movies is that they are easy fun, they have a certain quality to them but are also predictable, loud and follow a certain formula that always leads to danger in the form of an apocalypse. In the introduction of the movie you get acquainted with the country and the culture of Wakanda as well as their characters, like Nakia (Lupita Nyongo'o), W'kabi (Daniel Kaluuya), M'baku (Winston Duke) Zuri, (Forrest Whitaker) standouts Okoye and Shuri (who are played wonderfully by Danai Gurira and Letitia Wright respectively) and with minor roles for Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) and N'Jobu (Sterling K. Brown).<br/><br/>It must be mentioned that this movie feels very complete and stands on its own without being dependent on other instalments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It feels like a crash course about Wakanda and their leaders and culture. Every story arc begins and ends in a logical, well-told and satisfying way. The characters talk about the future of Wakanda by discussing traditions and change. It has great social commentary and talks about Black lives and culture. Family and legacy. Loyalty and betrayal. <br/><br/>Every scene of exposition ties into somebody's' personal story and serves a purpose. The Villain Killmonger is one of the best Marvel villains to date. He is certainly up there with Vulture from Spider-man: homecoming and maybe even Loki. The incentives for the actions of Killmonger are so clear, you feel for this character for what he has been through in his life, even rooting for him at certain times during the film. However, he doesn't get the screen time he deserves. He is introduced for a scene in the beginning of the film and disappears for maybe an hour, which gives the movie some tonal differences.<br/><br/>From a storytelling standpoint this movie excels, especially compared to other Marvel movies. Director Ryan Coogler once again shows us that he is here to stay. Because of him this movie just works. After Fruitvale Station and Creed, which were both very critically acclaimed, he comes with the most personal Marvel movie yet. scenes that will be remembered are the dramatic scenes, the acting, the chemistry between characters and the vibe of the movie instead of the action scenes, even though it's a superhero movie. <br/><br/>The action scenes are the most underwhelming parts of the movie. Some scenes look too animated and look unfinished, while other scenes have too many jump cuts and shaky cam to really know what is going on. The action scenes are just not memorable. You can clearly see where the money from the budget was spent on because the set and costume designs are top notch. Unfortunately, this led to weaker CGI heavy action/fighting scenes. <br/><br/>Overall, this was not just a good Marvel movie, this was a good movie, period. 
And even though the screenplay does not allow anything open for 
interpretation the movie does well by just telling a solid story. The Villain could've used more screen time, but the main and side characters are wonderful. The CGI could've been better, but the production design makes up for it. <br/><br/>8,5/10"

","Black Panther: To the outside world Wakanda is a struggling country, caught in the past, dependent on agriculture with little to export. Little does the West know that in fact Wakanda is an advanced technological society, its industry and wealth built on the Alien metal Vibranium. The Black Panther gets his power from a flower grown in soil tainted by Vibranium ore. (This being an Absolute Monarchy only he gets to ingest the flower. Don't ask this is comic book territory).<br/><br/>Following the death of King T'Chaka in the attack on the UN, T'Challa ( Chadwick Boseman) the Black Panther prepares to assume the throne. The kingdom maintains agents (War Dogs) in the outside world, one of whom is Nakia (Lupito Nyong'o), T'Challa's ex-lover, who is currently undercover fighting slavers. This allows BP to show off his powers in a fight with the slavers aided by Nakia and Okoye (Danai Gurira) leader of his female Special Forces, the Dora Milaje. The DM protect the Royal Family and Wakanda from internal and external attack (and presumably disembowel any uppity oiks who are looking for an elected president and parliament).<br/><br/>T'Challa and his sidekicks return to Wakanda for the Coronation ceremony where he has to take a potion stripping him of his powers before any possible challenge. He is challenged by M'Baku (Winston Duke), leader of the Mountain People. T'Challa triumphs and allows M'Baku to live. <br/><br/>But there is a lost Prince of Wakanda on the loose abroad, N'Jadaka (Michael Jordan) AKA Killmonger. This Prodigal Prince teams up with the murderous Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) a B List Bond Villain. They loot/liberate museums in search for Vibranium and N'Jadaka returns to Wakanda to challenge T'Challa for the throne.<br/><br/>Wakanda is a beautifully imagined country surrounded by mountains and rain forest, hidden by shields which cloak the true nature of the country. Challenges for the throne take place at the edge of magnificent waterfalls, top class CGI for the most part. Apart from it's War Dogs occasional interventions, Wakanda has stayed aloof from the struggles of the oppressed. N'Jadaka wants to change this by sending advanced weapons abroad. Civil War ensues, with even Vibranium clad rhinos involved.<br/><br/>The Wakandan technology ranges from dragonfly like attack craft to maglev trains and photon/energy powered Vibranium weapons. There is a vast subterranean cavern complex where the manufacture and R&D takes place. Chief Scientist is Shuri (Letitia Wright), T'Challa's teenage sister. <br/><br/>In supporting roles we have Angela Bassett as the Queen Mum, Forest Whitaker as Zuri, a wise old Counsellor and Martin Freeman as CIA agent Everett Ross. Ross is the butt of jokes as M'Baku roars: ""Silence or I'll feed you to my children! Only Kidding, we're vegetarians!"" Shuri comments: ""another broken white boy to fix"". as Ross arrives for medical treatment.<br/><br/>This film works on several layers with the spectres of Colonialism, Neo-Colonialism hanging over the action sequences. The meaning and natures of International Solidarity is also examined but sadly the anachronism of an Absolute Monarchy existing in an advanced Technological Society is left unquestioned. Good fun though. 8/10."
"philipposx-12290","7","1","6","17 February 2018"," Better than expected, still trademark cool adventure!
","For the time being, I have to say that I went into ""Black Panther"" with relatively few expectations. My love for superhero movies has become increasingly diminished over time. Not irresponsible of course is Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy, which (especially ""The Dark Knight"") makes most MCU movies look like a kindergarten. Even in spite of the good feedback from the critics (88 Metacritic), I mainly went to the cinema with two friends to have an entertaining, not necessarily memorable Saturday evening in 3D. <br/><br/>What makes Black Panther good? Obviously it's the visuals, which is something that seems to be really bombastic in many MCU movies. From the sound effects, to the well used CGI and the colorful camera shots, the visuals are really sensational. 
The film has a strong pacing and a good sense of urgency. It never drags. The action scenes are all strongly staged and also very exciting. Especially the Car Chase towards the beginning with the many camera angles, the great speed and entertaining gadgets. The black Panther Attire looked really great too. Surprisingly, the humor was actually solid. Of course, there were not the biggest laughs in here, but sometimes I could not resist the one or other grin. <br/><br/>Black Panther also thrives on the really good acting performances. Surprisingly, I knew quite a few actors from the main cast. To be honest, none other than Martin Freeman & Daniel Kaluuya. For me, Andy Serkis was surprisingly cool as ""Ulysses Klaue"", who was really good at his job despite very little screen time. Chadwick Boseman as hero & protagonist plays well, but the real show stealer was his antagonist. Michael B. Jordan plays the villain in a very convincing but also authentic manner. Maybe the characters aren't all as memorable as in other Superhero movies, but the ensemble is bigger for that. So there is one or two (very superficial) Punch-In-The-Gut moments. 
""Black Panther"" also has a good dramaturgy. The scenery is fluidly designed and continues to build up systematically.
The great ""Epic"" film doesn't really emerge, but the final battle is staged together with the music score in a very exciting way. <br/><br/>A lot of criticism (mainly from conventional audiences) that the film has had to deal with refers to the tribalism. Some see some kind of ""propaganda"" in here. Frankly, there may have been 1/2 minor implications or provocations regarding this problem, but nothing that put me personally out of the movie
What you have to notice is that the plot is, as with so many MCU movies, very predictable and partly repetitive.
The strands of action are put together quite unpretentiously. A lot of ""aha"" is not behind it, but in return, not much is done wrong. The storyline isn't that interesting and more or less very predictable.
The other points of criticism I would like to raise are closely related. The Character Delevopment did not exist in the end, because it was traded according to clichÃ©s and monotonous characteristics and therefore had a lot to do with continuous storytelling. The dialog was also quite constructed. Not bad in any way, just don't memorable or special.<br/><br/>Does Black Panther have a high recognition value in the genre?
Yes, but also no.
The Parallel Society or even ""World"" of Wakanda is original and the visual and the atmosphere differs from other action flicks. Superficially seen ""Black Panther"" is therefore really unique. Nevertheless, many things like character development, dialogue, hero/villain relationship are quite repetitive and offer little to nothing special.
---
CONCLUSION: Black Panther is a visually sensational film with good pacing and strongly staged action scenes, but not really outstanding in its genre. It is really good at what he is supposed to be and fills the classic superhero formula with 1/2 squiggles. Is it as good as Christopher Nolan's Batman movies? No, for God's sake, of course not. Is it a movie you should watch at the cinema or maybe buy on Blu-Ray? Yeah.

","I'm a big fan of Marvels' movies. Unfortunately, I couldn't say the same of DC Justice League. Well, the visual effects are really impressive. I'm anxious to see the next performance of Black Panther in Avenger Infinity war."

","'Black Panther' is co-written and directed by Ryan Coogler and stars Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa aka Black Panther, the title character. Following 'Captain America: Civil War', T'Challa returns to his home of Wakanda, a secret technologically advanced nation. Given his Father's demise in 'Civil War' he is to take his rightful place as King of Wakanda until unexpected adversaries surface which threaten not only his place on the throne but the fate of Wakanda itself. <br/><br/>For the most part 'Black Panther' is fun, exciting and sometimes even funny and features excellent performances from a terrific ensemble cast. However, it is not without its problems which for me prevent it from being a top tier MCU entry. First of all it seems in an attempt to side step the very well known villain problem in the MCU, director Coogler has actually shot himself in the foot and created one the most irritating and drab villains in this universe namely Eric Kilmonger. Michael B Jordan's performance as Kilmonger doesn't help either which is over done and at times a harbinger of cringe. The fault of this character is also due in part to the screenplay which leaves him out of it for almost an hour after his introduction. Honestly after his first scene had passed I completely forgot about him and was almost lead to believe that Klau (Andy Serkis) was the main antagonist of the film. Despite his motivations being more understandable than most mustache twirling villains in the MCU, the execution of the character is rather disappointing and a big misfire.<br/><br/>Now that the glaring problem is out of the way there are also some minor issues worthy of mention. The CGI looks unfinished in some places particularly in the big action set pieces toward the end. At one point Black Panther and Kilmonger look like video game creations when they fighting in mid air. <br/><br/>This probably sounds like I am trashing this film but I actually do like it quite a bit overall, I just felt it necessary to point out the wildly obvious missteps that a lot of people seem to be missing or blissfully ignoring. For example, Letitia Wright as Shuri, T'Challa's tech wizard sister, is a revelation not only as comic relief but as vital character to much of the film's plot. Lupita N'yongo also does good work here as T'Challa's love interest. Chadwick Boseman impresses again as T'challa, following on from his small but standout role in 'Civil War', proving a very charasmatic lead. Andy Serkis is also great here looking like he's having all the fun in the world and stealing every scene he's in reprising his character from 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. <br/><br/>So all in all 'Black Panther' is a decent upper mid tier entry in the MCU with some issues that prevent it from being one of the best that this universe has to offer."

","If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>Black Panther is the last Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) entry before the highly expected Avengers: Infinity War and it tells the story of T'Challa's (Chadwick Boseman) rise to become King of Wakanda.<br/><br/>Right after the events of Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther returns to the isolated nation of Wakanda, but an old enemy reappears and the King's throne is put to the test. A conflict ensues and the fate of the whole world becomes in danger.<br/><br/>Black Panther is one of my most anticipated films of this year (you can check the list HERE) and I couldn't wait to watch it on an IMAX theater. I loved Boseman's presence in Civil War and his action sequences were amazing, so I was super excited to see what his origin movie could bring to the MCU.<br/><br/>Well, it is undoubtedly one of the best in the franchise and its place on the top one-third of the MCU is certainly guaranteed. It has a very heartfelt and culturally significant screenplay. This carries an even bigger weight than Wonder Woman did because for the first time in the cinema history, a film with not only a black lead superhero but with a 95% black cast (only two white characters), shines through with an emotional story.<br/><br/>The script is remarkably well-written. It has a lot of references to the real world but in the opposite way: Wakanda is more technologically advanced than the rest of the world and for once, black people are not the ones falling behind. I love this aspect of the movie, Ryan Coogler cleverly portrays a world where things are not as everyone thinks they are. This film is demonstrative of how to flawlessly build a world in a cinematic universe.<br/><br/>Also an example of perfection, the casting is phenomenal! Marvel never fails in getting the absolute best actors and actresses to portray their respective roles, either these being the lead hero or a secondary character. Everyone has terrific performances, but some are worth mentioning in detail.<br/><br/>I will not even start with Boseman. Firstly, I have to write about Michael B. Jordan and his interpretation of the villain, Erik Killmonger. Jordan is incredible, there isn't a single scene where he doesn't shine and he elevates his character. That said, Killmonger is by far the best villain since the beginning of everything (Iron Man (2008)).<br/><br/>His compelling journey makes the audience care for him and his beliefs are very true to his heart. He is what he thinks the people need him to be in order for everyone to be able to live freely and protected from the ""bad guys"" running the world. His backstory is very tragic and it sets up a dilemma between him and T'Challa. Erik is notably well-developed and Coogler does a wonderful job co-writing him with Joe Robert Cole.<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman is right up there as well. He fully embodies his character, nailing the accent and making every interaction that he shares with his family or his close friends feel so realistic and full of emotion. T'Challa is an exceptional protagonist, it is easy to stand behind him since his motivations are genuine and passionate. He wants the best for his people and he wants to be an even better King than his father, by trying to correct his past mistakes.<br/><br/>I don't even consider T'Challa and Killmonger as the hero and the villain, respectively. Each character has their own perspective and their reasons are both solid, so when the time for their head-to-head comes, I can't really choose a side. Coogler and Cole brilliantly write the characters' script and each one has their own reasons to support either Boseman or Jordan's characters. This is why this movie probably has the best characters in the whole MCU.<br/><br/>Lupita Nyong'o beautifully portrays Nakia, a warrior that doesn't rely on tradition that much as she also wants to see the poor people around the world with a better quality of life. Danai Gurira (Okoye) is a badass and her character is also very well-developed, plus she has some cool action sequences. I also would like to congratulate Andy Serkis (Ulysses Klaue) for his excellent over-the-top performance, as well as Daniel Kaluuya (W'Kabi), Letitia Wright (super funny as Shuri) and Martin Freeman (Everett K. Ross).<br/><br/>Actually, Ross was one of the characters that I left the theater wondering if he was really necessary. Being the only white person in Wakanda, I took a while to fully understand his role. Truthfully, he doesn't introduce or helps to develop any other character and he only has one or two scenes to shine. However, he is important to the cultural value of the film! He is the personification of the rest of the world, he thinks he is several steps ahead of T'Challa and his people, but Freeman ends up being the ignorant of Wakanda's greatness.<br/><br/>Like I wrote earlier, this is one of the best installments of the MCU. Culturally, it means a lot and the story has a lot of substance. The cinematography looks gorgeous, the nation of Wakanda is very well designed through CGI and the editing is great throughout the whole runtime. The epic score is one of the highlights. A lot of praise has been given to Kendrick Lamar for the rap vibe that he implements in the movie, but nothing beats the African traditional sounds that elevate not only the action scenes but every single moment.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this film is not perfect. While its tone is well-balanced, its pacing not so much. The first act drags too much and it feels that some scenes could have been left out. From the first ritual battle onwards, the movie starts getting its pace right and the entertainment level gets higher. However, the plot follows a predictable path and it ends up on a disappointing note ... Coogler doesn't do good directing the most important action scene.<br/><br/>The CGI might be very good and it is indeed well-controlled during the film, but it is misused in the climactic fight at the end. I mean, the first ritual battle between T'Challa and (at the time) a random character is way more exciting and better filmed (good handling of the shaky cam and the water splashes effects are pretty cool) than the supposedly epic showdown with Killmonger. Leaving the theater disappointed with the fight is never a good sign, especially when there are so many awesome action moments during the film. Apart from this, a couple of exposition scenes could have been told in a better way, but these are all minor issues that I have with one of the best superhero movies in the most recent years.<br/><br/>All in all, Black Panther lives up to the hype and it does not fail. With an extraordinary cast, Boseman and Jordan lead a very heartfelt and emotional story, filled with fantastic characters and beautiful world-building. Killmonger is the absolute standout as the best villain of the entire MCU, the script is on-point for every character and the plot is very well-written, even if it becomes predictable. Technically great, but not flawless. While the cinematography, the editing and mainly the score elevate the film, the first act's slow pacing and the extremely disappointing climactic battle between the two leads bring down the movie, ending it on a bittersweet note. Still, this is surely in the top one-third of the MCU and I can't wait for Avengers: Infinity War!"
"anubisxelt","8","1","6","17 February 2018"," Over-hyped but still pretty good
","Black Panther was a really well made movie which I fairly enjoyed. The general story was really good for a intro arc to the MCU, and had a good balance with humor. Now the villian Killmonger was very well acted by Michael B Jordan and it's very sad to see him die as it felt like the movie didn't show a lot of him in it. The problems I had with this movie were some of the fight scenes in the beginning and one at the end. The ones in the beginning were too fast paced and you had no idea what was going on. The one at the end when Black Panther is fighting Killmonger, at one point they seem very cartoonish and it makes the scene look rigid and not agile (or catlike). Sometimes it was also hard to know what they were saying due to accent but you still got the general idea of what they were trying to say. I was very excited for this movie but I feel like it was over-hyped. There wasn't a lot of action and the director saying that it would be the James Bond of the MCU was not shown in this movie at all. It felt more of a Lion King story where T'Challa must fight for the throne. It did make me close to crying at 2 points in the movie but never did it it make me butt clench in the action scenes. I will still rate this movie a solid 8/10!"

","Looks like there are some folks trying to keep this movie down. (Russian Hackers? Fox News?) I doubt that much will come of this campaign. This film handles its business and leaves little doubt that it has. I'm not saying it's perfect but by super hero blockbuster standards, it definitely exceeds expectations. <br/><br/>The writers/director (Coogler and Cole) have actually taken the time to write the actioner you want along with a fleshed out, exceedingly thoughtful and wonderfully relevant story, the likes of which have rarely graced this genre. This comic book myth may have been hatched in '62 alongside the emergence of the 'Black Panther' movement but this film announces that the social ideas and dreams, that were always that movement's subtext, remains alive. If you only know the 'Panthers' as a violent, revolutionary group, then you don't know the 'Black Panthers'. (I recommend the PBS documentary)<br/><br/>Boswick is an excellent choice for T'Challa aka 'The Black Panther'. He's crafted an understated hero which suits his humility as great warrior and compassionate king. Michael B. Jordan aka 'Erik Killmonger' has come a long way since his days on The Wire and with good reason. He's truly become a wonderful, sensitive and intense actor which is on full display here. His portrayal is fully four dimensional having some ask whether he would have been a better Black Panther. Really, the entire cast goes all out to make this a human experience.<br/><br/>Overall, the special effects are good with only a few over-the-top CGI moments and obligatory choreo-fights. <br/><br/>This film isn't so much about the action (Don't worry. It's in there.) as it is about establishing the myth and proposing another way of seeing and being. AND the message isn't just for people of color.<br/><br/>No spoilers today. Wouldn't want to undermine the experience in any way.<br/><br/>8.5 stars!"
"h-20587","7","1","6","17 February 2018"," Surprisingly serious MCU film with great world-building
","Some preliminary remarks: overhyping a pop culture film into the second coming of Martin Luther King or (fitting for the title) Malcolm X never does any good, although a lot of the themes of the American civil rights movement resonate in the conflict of T'Challa and Killmonger.<br/><br/>The film has a five act structure, which is a nice change of pace for an MCU release. The first act is mainly expository and world-building and gives an intriguing view of the nation of Wakanda. The place looks gorgeous although it is entirely CG. I am still not sure why the Wakandans have chosen to remain hidden for so long. The second act is action-packed and has the best fight scene of the entire film, the casino in Busan in South Korea. It is a signature move of Ryan Coogler to keep one long camera shot on the fight without cutting away (cf. his work in ""Creed"").<br/><br/>Both third and fourth acts are more drama than action, especially the fourth act, building up the villain of T'Challa, his cousin Killmonger. His motives are believable but Michael B. Jordan does not give his best performance here in my view (especially if you remember him in ""Creed"", in which he was phenomenal). It was during these two acts where I lost interest a bit in the film, especially after Klauwe got killed. He was the far superior villain and this is mainly due to the phenomenal acting of Andy Serkis. Give this man more live action roles! In general, I found the acting performances to be Ok for an MCU film but nothing outstanding.<br/><br/>The final act is all action, with lots of CG. Most of it fell flat for me, but the metal rhinos were a neat idea. The ending was nice, with Wakanda stepping out of the shadows and onto the world's stage. All in all, another good entry to the MCU, with a much more serious story (and almost no or only mild jokes! The Anti-Thor: Ragnarok of the MCU!). Best MCU film ever? No, certainly not, at least not after my initial viewing. It reminds me of coming out of ""Doctor Strange"" but with a more meaningful story and better world-building.<br/><br/>One thing intrigued me very much: in the second act, having all these Africans in Korea, that was a glimpse into a post-white world and I would have loved to see more Asian-African crossovers. Maybe for another time!"

","While Wakanda is a marvel to behold, The story in Black Panther is quite generic and predictable. The action is light and far from revolutionary. The film's basic structure mimics that of 2011's Thor. Killmonger is an solid villain, although his limited screentime and certain dialogue prevents him from being the greatest but he's one of better villains The MCU has. Phase 3 overall has been much better in the villain department. The CGI painfully reminds of PS2 video games especially in the 3rd act. While the tone is more serious, it doesn't erase the fact that this film's vibranium weaving has some cracks. It's an good film but not the masterpiece being touted. The performances elevated a rather generic and predictable story. C"

"drawlife","8","2","19","16 February 2018"," Better late than never right?
","Black Panther is like a checklist. A checklist that fulfills every aspect and almost goes above and beyond. The film is unapologetically African and it subtly deals with real political issues. I'd argue the film is almost on par with the first Iron Man, the first Avengers, and the Captain America trilogy.<br/><br/>Ryan Coogler has proven himself as a capable director in his own right, with Creed and Fruitvale Station, and now he's three for three with Black Panther. Coogler puts the characters and the narrative(albeit kinda predictable) first before the action and spectacle. <br/><br/>I'd like to mention though some of the cinematography is gorgeous so kudos to Rachel Morrison. Costume designs are fabulous so another kudos to Ruth E. Carter. Last but not least to the visual development team, Ryan Meinerding, Andy Park, Carla Ortiz, and the others. I don't know if any of you ever picked up the concept art-books of the MCU films, but these guys and girls put a lot of effort into coming up with the creative look of each film. <br/><br/>Coogler and Joe Robert Cole explore some thought-provoking ideas such as isolationism, revolution, and the cultures of oppression. They tackle real world problems without being too preachy or over the top, but enough to get the point across in an effective manner. If you have the strongest and not to mention the most versatile metal on Earth, I would doubt you'd want to share that kind of info to the world, but then again you can also do so much to help others in need. <br/><br/>With that being said, this is where Michael B. Jordan's Erik Killmonger is effective. The performance is kind of over the top, but it registers and you can sorta feel his rage and anger. He's definitely not the wasted villain that the MCU is notorious for. As I've mentioned before, the Phase 3 villains, while not perfect, are a step up to every other villain the MCU has given us aside from Loki, Red Skull, and Winter Soldier. Jordan's portrayal while again, slightly over the top, makes you see his point of view like The Vulture or Zemo. <br/><br/>The women also are a stand out. Angela Bassett's role doesn't have too much to do but her acting chops alone make you believe in her relationship with T'Challa. Letitia Wright provides a lot humor as the sharp witted Wakandan genius and sister to T'Challa, Shuri. Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira are also highlights as Nakia and General Okoye. Nyong'o and Boesman don't overplay their complicated/romantic relationship and Gurira's character butts heads with T'Challa frequently, but is also fiercely loyal to her king. <br/><br/>Other cast members are solid. I certainly didn't expect Forest Whitaker, Daniel Kaluuya, and Martin Freeman to have the roles that they did, so kudos to Coogler and Robert Cole for figuring out all those moving parts. Especially Kaluuya's role as W'Kabi. Winston Duke and Andy Serkis just chew up the scenery with their roles as well. Particularly Serkis, as it was nice seeing Ulysses Klaue make his return. <br/><br/>Now on to Chadwick Boseman. He is so good in this role I forget the accent he speaks with in this film is just him acting. When I watched interviews with him I totally forgot he has the American accent. He's equally believable as a superhero, but as a man grieving for his father and questioning his ability to be a fitting king. <br/><br/>Yes the film is by the numbers, kinda predictable, and by the books, yes some of the special effects don't look as polished to be quite honest, the action set pieces are competent but not mind-blowing, and the shaky camera was a bit of an annoyance. With that being said, being a comic-book geek I am pleased with the final result and I cannot wait to see what Marvel Studios has in store for T'Challa next. <br/><br/>Black Panther has been quite the talk lately as there have been many opinions about the significance of a black superhero. Let us not forget about Wesley Snipes's Blade, but up until Black Panther's release, much of Hollywood considered a film with an all black cast as niche for certain demographics, but never as a blockbuster or a franchise like this. Like Wonder Woman, Black Panther will open even more doors for movies similar to them, and everyone associated with this movie on another level. <br/><br/>8.8/10"
"hutomo_gates","7","2","19","15 February 2018"," The Earliest Marvel movie of all time
","This is my short review about Black Panther. Well, the story is pretty standard and cliche for superhero movies. I can say that the ending in accordance with most audiences. Introduction to some characters recognition has deficiencies in the introduction and thus affecting the presence and impact of this film plot, but not all of it.<br/><br/>one of the things that impressed me so much about this movie was the musical score. Background music in some scenes uses music and instruments typically from African culture. Color patterns in costumes and places are very diverse and pamper the eyes. Wakanda's depiction is presented with great CGI and some very futuristic technology. The production design that is very different from previous Marvel films and carries African culture as its main theme. As well as the acting of some main characters are incredible. I was very impressed with Michael B. Jordan's acting as Erik Killmonger. In this film, Erik is described as very evil, cunning and intelligent but can steal the attention of the audience.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is my recommendation if you want to watch a different movie superhero, in terms of themes, production design and music score."
"gogojoe-90902","9","3","36","17 February 2018"," It's not the Godfather of super hero films but it's very very good.
","Just watched Black Panther... Initial thoughts are that this was a great film. Few things I'd have changed though. Namely I'd have liked to see certain characters survive. But the story while typical of many superhero films was excecuted exceedingly well. Also the final conflict relied very heavily on cg, but I don't think I'd call it a negative as this is a comic based movie. I brought my eldest, Ashlee and she LOVED it. Black Panther and the denziens of Wakanda, while entirely fictional, felt real in a way that made the fantasy of it all come to life in a spectacular way much like Spiderman Homecoming did. One of my favorite moments is seeing the rhino riders. Also the mid credit scene is perfect. I am looking forward to a new era of the MCU with T'Challa heavily in the forfront of it. <br/><br/>My overall rating is 9/10<br/><br/>This was my short spoiler free review from Facebook. But below is my spoiler filled review.
 Again SPOILERS ahead<br/><br/>While the overall story is fairly generic the way it is presented makes it feel fresh in a way few MCU movies have been able to capture. Black Panther is a joy from start to finish. Many have complained about details from weak character development to overly relying on special effects. To be honest the biggest thing that this movie suffers from is being overly hyped. The media has been building this movie to to be something nearly unattainable. This movie shot for the stars and while it did not quite make it to that lofty point, Black Panther made it quite far. While this is not the first ever Black super hero stand alone film (the Blade movies come to mind and to a lesser extent Meteor Man) this is the first one to appeal to the masses. It does suffer from a few supporting characters being left wanting. Namely Forrest Whittaker's. During the duel between T'Challa and Killmonger, Forrest intervines and dies for his efforts. While the scene does show Killmongers ruthlessness it does not have a huge emotional impact. I bring it up because T'Challa reacts in such a viseral way. But the character was not built up very well. We see him a few times and most if his screen times acting as a glorified priest / ref which leads me to believe his scenes were cut short for time. Another character side story that suffers is the romance storyline. It's brief and and predicable. Enough said.<br/><br/>Another issue I had was that they killed off Klaw Midway through the film. He is built up as the scourge of Wakanda and that he had escaped justice for 30 years after steeling a bunch Vibranium and killed many Wakandans. Klaw is captured by Black Panther and the CIA but is rescued by Kilmonger. All that only to be killed by his savior in the next screen he is shown in. Yes I understand it sets up his ability to enter Wakanda with Klaws body as his token in. I'm just fond of the character and Andy Serkis' performance was amazing. Klaw could have easily been used again in future films had they had Klaw turned over to the Wakandans crown and it could have accomplished they same outcome..<br/><br/>The highlights are the scenes that take place in South Korea. The casino battle is bedlam in the most fun way possible. A personal favorite is during the final battle sequence. Watching the Black Panther wrestling a charging armored rhino to the ground is a thing of beauty. But the best thing about this film is that from the word go you are engrossed and when it ends you leave wanting more so that when you see that the Black Panther will return in Avengers you sigh in relief. I enjoyed seeing exactly how advanced Wakanda is and hiw the rest if the world views them. The mid credits scene that shows T'Challa and co announcing Wakanda to the UN was a perfect cap off to that. In case you are wondering how advanced they are... Well let's just say they have stuff that will make Stark blush in shame. Also Michael B. Jordan is prefect as Killmonger and really stands out in this film. But the women if this movie is where the heart and soul is really found. Like last year's Wonder Woman it just further proves that women are capable of holding a action film together. Boseman was good as T'Challa but was not the emotional core. See this movie suffered from the Avengers 4 looming in the distance since we all know he survives. But during the films climax you feel genuine fear for the fates of several characters outside of T'Challa.<br/><br/>I love movies and most of all I love superhero movies and this movie was awesome. Go see it!<br/><br/>Sidenote: and this should go with out saying but if you are racist then you most likely will not enjoy yourself."

","Although both it and Thor: Ragnarok take place in glittering, futuristic kingdoms, Black Panther strikes a rather different note from the galactic romp vibe Ragnarok went for. Don't get me wrong: while it is rife with serious moments and dramatic tension (it would be hard not to, after Civil War!), and grapples with themes of loss and legacy, Black Panther does manage to smoothly deliver some well-timed comedy to lighten up the journey. Our theater adored Shuri, T'challa's irrepressible little sister, and I'm sure you will too.<br/><br/>Many will zoom in, so to speak, on the visual richness of the film: African designs and aesthetic isn't something we see very much of in mainstream American media, to say nothing of our blockbusters, and the futuristic skyline of Wakanda has obviously been carefully crafted to make the city both unique and true to its roots. And the scenery is excellent, as is the costuming. However, the movie's strongest point, I feel is in its acting. Every one of the main cast delivered a memorable performance: Chad Bosewick is finally allowed to fully portray T'challa's grief and conflict to spectacular effect; Lupita Nyongo'o matches him scene for scene and is impossible to take your eyes off of; Michael B. Jordan manages to be at once terrifying, sympathetic and too compelling to make a truly tidy villain; Danai Gurira's screen presence and the sheer force of nature that is the character Okoye herself comes through from the very first time she steps onscreen, and sometimes without a single word spoken; and Letitia Wright dances effortlessly from the hilarious to the heartrending, stealing every scene she's in. I would need a lot more words and a lot more time to detail every performance that needed praising.<br/><br/>So, while Black Panther is at its core a Marvel superhero movie, with the requisite cheese, heaping helping of action (Note: I'm not complaining, because that shit was fun as HELL), and some heavy-handedness in its political messaging (let's remember, though, Iron Man and Afghanistan and terrorism, terrorism, terrorism)... It's the chemistry and passion that both the actors/actresses and the film crew have put into this movie that form the heart of the story. It has the distinction of being the first Marvel movie that managed to make me well up, all while sitting at the edge of my seat and then being surprised into laughing by a deftly executed bit of slapstick or snark. It doesn't shy away from examining issues of racism, broken families, tradition vs. responsibility, pacifism vs. imperialism, and other uncomfortable topics that the world, but especially the U.S., could stand to reflect upon this year. It works through these issues to show us the characters moving towards a more hopeful future than any previous generation could have imagined, and isn't that what sci-fi is all about?<br/><br/>Our theater loved this film. We laughed together, we cried together, we applauded together at the end. Thank you for a wonderful experience, Black Panther. I absolutely plan on seeing it again, and making sure the rest of my family does, too."

What is clearly evident is that Ryan Coogler has delivered three outstanding films in three attempts in different genres. He has done all three with Michael B. Jordan, whose outing here as the corrupted revolutionary Erik Killmonger is another in a long line of excellent performances. Chadwick Boseman made T'Challa the break-out character of ""Civil War"" and proves after headlining three biographical dramas that he is also an action star. Letitia Wright shines as Shuri, stealing every scene she is in, and standing out among the film's outstanding cast."

"FelipeCarrillo","9","1","7","26 April 2018"," ""Black Panther"": Marvel Studios' first fiction which portrays a part of our world with seriousness and sensitivity
","We may well could be in front of ""The Movie"" of the MCU, by virtue of its coldness by man-made entertainment or fantastic narratives as a plot base, placing a homogeneous criticism on race, social chaos, feminism, power, politics, technology, honor and human demons, an unusual maneuver hitherto by the company that works perfectly in the ideal story, as T'Challa, king of Wakanda, becomes a milestone in the history of comic film adaptations, because of it's the first one that manages to blur that unresectable concentration by comedy and action in order to enter a field of more realistic, moralistic and compelling treatment, of course, without relegating an exciting, kinetic and fearless process to reach that stage.<br/><br/>First of all, it must be said that ""Black Panther"" isn't a masterpiece. What's more, I took a while sympathizing with it running the first fifteen minutes, nonetheless, after having understood what was not working to allow me to automatically connect with the film, I came to the conclusion that such incompatibility was illogically derived from its original out-of-the-ordinary nature, that requested feature by all cinephile; Here the social and artistic message matters through creativity, because when it materializes in front of me, I found it impossible not to appreciate tremendous work, a fully unknown universe of stories or its introductory function to ""Infinity War"" aren't what make it compelling at all, what's make it unique is the value it holds for itself, since it relays an infinity of reflections and perceptions on reality, managing to touch everyone's hearts, especially to those poorly represented in and by cinema. It was such the transcendence that I decided to skip its post-credits scenes, I didn't want anything to do away with stupefaction that the nation of Wakanda left in my mind. This is a film that must be experienced on the larger screen under obligation. Also, unlike Marvel's previous flicks, this must be processed and analyzed primarily by the brains of adults and young people, obviously, without dismissing the full-fun ride constructed for the most little enthusiasts.<br/><br/>Thereafter, ""BP"" is a cinematic blast. Opening with a sterling introduction to the place of the events, Wakanda twists the aim of a world power to turn it into a highly secret nation, rich in technology, advances in transport, health, economics and politics at the expense of the strongest metal in the MCU: Vibranium. However, they prefer to keep a low profile, creating a kind of selfishness by remaining hidden from outside eyes and ears, since, without hesitation, they'd be a sure target for the most vulnerable and near-to-extinct nations. And here the first topic for discussion comes up, one that will keep talking to the curious for quite some time. There is the fact that they can choose to remain anonymous to preserve intact their wealth and their nation standing or reveal their kingdom before a world burning in flames of hatred, finding it difficult to relinquish part of its stability in favor of the recovery and hope of the homeless, coming into play two ways which are really close to the current world stage.<br/><br/>Another of its many strengths, which is present in the solid screenplay, is the important participation of women in the storyline. Just like ""Wonder Woman"" did, this film proudly represents what it means to be a woman of color, an impressive achievement - even if it's sad to mention: what differentiates white and black women? -for those ""minorities"", since each one of them receives a virtuous development, each one treasures a coherent and exciting dramatic background, daring individuals with hopeful characteristics; courageously intelligent believers, figures who honor two of the least respected groups by a society that grows in machismo and vanity: women and black people. In addition to writing rich and electrifying stories and foundations for them, the fighting scenes, which lies on the shoulders of the Dora Milaje, are superb, very close to Patty Jenkins' spectacular combats executed by the Amazons, the relation is valid thanks to the impact of these gigantic set-pieces that ends up being inspiring, getting to raise another important analogy. A Trojan army with three horrific beasts as helpers fighting against an army of female warriors - it should not be a source for joy, but it's such a representation of the female gender that this really means a significant breakthrough - struggling for their family, their lands, their king. This kind of scene symbolizes commitment by equality, not only for actresses who aspire to have important roles in the Mecca of cinema, but for every lady around the globe who is hurt by the dominance of her husband, father or boss; an inspiring incorporation that allows to dream of a more balanced planet, a readjustment to the balance of fairness and respect. From the beginning, they lose the horizon trying to build the mystery around the mansion, without noticing that, in half of the story, we no longer care what happens to any of them.<br/><br/>Visually, Coogler's feature film is a glorious feast. Omitting only eventual perceptions of green screen in the background of fight scenes in the cascade and some flaws on special effects in the glamorous car chase, it can claim to have the same bravery and power in the pictures as the most recent release of the company, as it represents a radical color and style opposite with respect to Taika Waititi's colorful ode, here sobriety leads to sublimity in many of the scenes that enroll with honor in the best of the MCU; it's impossible to believe how the studio is surpassed by each new entry and this is no exception. Wakanda is as beautiful as complex thanks to the hard work of Rachel Morrison, the art & production department and anyone involved in the creative and artistic process, is magnificent and evidenced in the final product, an organic story about forgiveness and honor that experiment brand-new features for sure. Just like Ragnarok for Thor, Wakanda is another great discovery, not only for its magnetic culture, but for the artistic potential of this land that connects technology and nature organically.<br/><br/>There are many people agree that Ludwig Göransson's score will be a strong contender for several gold awards. In addition to a lot of praises, the accompanying melodies and specific compositions that nourish fight sequences, moments of tension or a trivial talk are spectacular, his score has a great influence by African culture, drums and instruments are compactly intermingled with the vitality and extravagance of heroic melodies, a necessary choice as thanks to this important effect, the film manages to be what it is, a representative marvel. It should be noted that the soundtrack created in the name of the film by Kendrick Lamar goes very much in the style of his songs and is concordant; especially ""Pray For Me"" included in one of the most stylistic scenes, where The Weeknd's stunning vocals shine on their own.<br/><br/>And finally: Ryan Coogler. It's not odd that the film opens in Oakland, California, because the filmmaker is from there, he knows the ailments of his people, knows the suffering and the causes of it because, like B. Jordan, we catch reflected in his work a sincere representation of hope and union for the entire black race, a love letter to his town in which their lives, values and dreams are highlighted. With only two feature films, Coogler directs his big Hollywood directional debut and he gets what Jordan Peele got with his opera prima as a director: to talk about a multitude of issues of global significance conveying his clear and realistic position. The film works in many fields, it's perceptible the effort in the idea and it's perceptible that the director knew how to portray what on the paper seemed so difficult, here, he's not limited to using a fantastic language because he also mixes culture and diversity in a film that will serve as a catapult to fame and opportunities. The American director and screenwriter presents one of the most interesting visions put on the genre, because it's one with foundation and purpose: to reach the heart of minorities, giving a message of peace, union and equality, symbolized by a hopeful ending very similar to ""The Last Jedi's"" final scene, a little boy starts dreaming.<br/><br/>""Black Panther"" by Ryan Coogler transforms what a superhero movie must be, delivering children of color an idealized model with which they can dream now. In the long run, the film from the ""Fruitvale Station"" director and screenwriter works in many fields at the same time, it serves as a social commentary on the selfishness of the white people, politics, vices and discrimination while coherently produces a novel and unusual journey among Wakanda's technological and fascinating landscapes. Somehow, it's the ""Get Out"" of Marvel Studios, and reverses the comic-adaptation formula, placing its hero in harsh situations that can be compared to the real-life difficulties of a normal person. By far, one of the most different and original superhero flicks to date, ""Black Panther"" will serve as an illusion to many boys and girls, men and women who see in Marvel's dramatized works a possibility of change, an encouragement to start over again, even though when they get out of the theater and know that one more friend is gone for a society feeding on violence, inequality and apathy."
"proud_luddite","8","1","7","24 April 2018"," The most beautiful movie I've seen in years
","Based on the Marvel Comic series: the fictional African nation of Wakanda poses as underdeveloped but is, in truth, one of the most developed nations on the planet due to its access to a special substance call vibranium. In current times, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) is about to become king of Wakanda but he must face various challengers. T'Challa, his family, and his loyal friends face animosity from within and outside Wakanda. Some of their enemies believe that Wakanda should share its advanced technology to help other Africans in great need.<br/><br/>Like many big-budget blockbusters, ""Black Panther"" is thrilling, exciting, and entertaining. It is also, like those other big-budget blockbusters, occasionally confusing with too many subplots happening simultaneously. But in fairness, it is less confusing than most other such films. What truly makes this film unique in this genre is its Afrocentric focus and perspective with an almost all-black cast. In this way, it has made history and is a welcome breakthrough. Its focus on whether or not Wakanda should remain isolationist also provides an intelligent critique on the current state of the world.<br/><br/>""Black Panther"" has something else to its credit: it is a visual splendor and probably the most beautiful film to grace the big screen in many years - yet another reason to recommend this fine film. It truly is a feast for the eyes and is entertaining in so many other ways as well.<br/><br/>OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS: Cinematography; Set Design; Costumes"

","There was a joke on the internet the other day that made me laugh and laugh. Virtually the only white people in ""Black Panther"" are the Hobbit/LOTR stars Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis.... they are the Tolkein white guys! It's actually getting to feel quite isolating as an 'average white guy' at the movies! After a plethora of #SheDo films about empowered women, now comes the first black-centred Marvel film... stuffed full of powerful women too!<br/><br/>The setting is the hidden African kingdom of Wakanda, where due to an abundance of a an all-powerful mineral called McGuffinite... so, sorry, Vibranium... the leaders have made their city a technological marvel and developed all sorts of ad tech to help the people keep their goats well and weave their baskets better (there are a few odd scenes in this film!). T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) succeeds his father T'Chaka (John Kani) to become the king and adopt the role of The Black Panther, being bestowed superhero powers by drinking a glass of Ribena.<br/><br/>But it emerges that T'Chaka has a dark secret in the form of Eric Killmonger (Michael B Jordan, ""Creed"") who is determined to muscle in on the king-stuff. 'It never rains but it pours', and the whole of Wakanda's secrets are in danger of being exposed by the antics of the vicious South African mercenary Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis, ""War For The Planet Of The Apes""), trying to get his hands on vibranium to sell on to CIA operative Everett Ross (Martin Freeman, ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"", ""The World's End"").<br/><br/>After ""Thor: Ragnarok"", this is back to the more seriously-played end of the superhero spectrum: there are a few jokes but it's not overtly played for comedy. Holding the film together are some sterling performances from the ensemble cast with Michael B Jordan very good as the villain of the piece. Adding to the significant black girl power in the film are Angela Bassett (""London Has Fallen"") as the queen mother; Danai Gurira (""Wonder Woman"") as the leader of the Dora Milaje: the all-female king's guard; and Lupita Nyong'o (""12 Years a Slave"", ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"") as the spy and love interest Nakia. But the star performance for me, and one I found absolutely spot-on as a role model for young people, was Letitia Wright (""The Commuter"") as Shuri, the king's chief scientist. She is absolutely radiant, adding beauty, rude gestures and energy to every scene she is in.<br/><br/>On the white side of the shop Andy Serkis has enormous fun as Klaue and I really wanted to see more of his character than I did. Martin Freeman feels rather lightweight and under-used, and I couldn't quite get past his dodgy American accent.<br/><br/>In terms of storyline, the film is a hotch-potch of plots from multiple other films, with ""The Lion King"" featuring strongly (but almost in reverse!). But that's no crime, when the Shakespearean-style narrative is good, and interpolating the strongly emotional story into the Marvel universe works well.<br/><br/>Where I felt a little uncomfortable is the element of racism - that is, racism *against* white people - reflected in the story. If there was a movie plot centred (basically) on the topic of whites killing blacks and taking control of every black-controlled country in the world (yes, I know, I'm British and we have historically been there!) then there would be justified uproar, and the film would be shunned.<br/><br/>In the technical department, I had real problems with some of the effects employed. Starting with a dodgy 'aircraft' shadow, things nose-dive with an astonishingly poor waterfall scene with Forest Whitaker (""Rogue One"", ""Arrival"") as Zuri, green-screened against some Disneyworld cascades and hundreds of cut and pasted tribesmen randomly inserted onto the cliffs. Almost matching that is a studio-set scene in a jungle clearing, where if feels they could hardly have bothered to take the plants out of their pots. Think ""Daktari"" quality (kids, ask your parents/grandparents).<br/><br/>But overall, the film, directed by Ryan Coogler (""Creed""), is a high-energy and uniquely different take on Marvel that absolutely pays off. And it is without doubt an important movie in moving the black agenda forward into properly mainstream cinema.<br/><br/>(For the full graphical review please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

I really liked the visuals, especially the African-folkloristic inspired costumes, buildings and ceremonies. The car action scenes had me excited in the cinema, same with the casino fight with the lady in the red dress. There was some humour in it which I liked because it didn't feel as forced as in Age of Ultron or similar Marvel pieces. The characters' backstories and motivations actually made me care about them. They seemed sympathetic and not as hollow as in Dr. Strange where I really couldn't bring myself to like anyone in the whole movie. This film actually made me shed one (1) manly tear in the cinema (a first). One complaint I have is with the final fight scene in the dark with both combattants wearing dark suits where you could never quite see what was going on. Apart from that I pretty much loved it, one of Marvels best for me. I was entertained and the great soundtrack made up for the brain cells I lost watching Chadwick Boseman wrestle a rhinoceros."
"scraben","8","1","7","7 March 2018"," A Mixture Of Old & Hopeful New
","This movie isn't merely a superhero film. This is a strong cultural representation that which typically becomes ignored unless tragedy or near-savagery are openly displayed upon the screen. The film is a good opening saga towards a character whom was introduced to the cinematic in Captain America: Civil War. Quite sadly, I did not care for the character in that display of him. Though, in the solo film, I'm a strong-holding fan of his & the movie, in general.<br/><br/>No, I can not say that the film is flawless. To textually or vocally utter such is nonsensical. Though, the film attempts to not only give a better display of the character, it fully wants to enlist interested visitors towards his nation(for those of whom are tech fans). It does not display fully women to the utmost regard(nor does it disrespects women of any means), but it channels the energy enough to fully do such in the next film(T'Challa's Sister, Shuri, is his primary tech/weapons developer/designer). It's villain, intriguingly, is properly played with the character housing the same quasi-discontent for his ""motherland"" as which is generally shown in a reverse accord in real life.<br/><br/>The means that the spiritual magic plays a strong, yet small, underbelly towards the technological shock is, oddly, great. The film would've been too bogged down if that was fully shown, yet the next one holds the aspect of going even further with that concept seeded into the story. It showcases that there is more than the 'Marvel'ous advanced tech that the country holds dear; it connects towards it's rooting cultural basis, as well.<br/><br/>Hopefully, this could become a stand-alone trilogy whilst the primary character houses a good role within Infinity War saga, or even after such. There is a firm basis laid & we can see that the panther has a growl, if we can see him complete pounce or maul(I'm metaphorically regarding, mind you) while retaining his intelligence, then we could see one of the best comic book to film series thus far. Right now, though, we have a really decent movie that most can enjoy, regardless of race & comic book fandom."

As any origin story, the film illustrates the growth of the individual but, in doing so, carves its own path with grand ideas such as the fulfillment of legacy and the deprivation of heritage.<br/><br/>Remarkable? 
In this Marvel outing, I'd argue that the setting is just as important as the characters in the film. Though a setting in actuality, as a character, Wakanda brings an influence, enriched with a technology meets tradition aesthetic which can play into T'Challa's involvement in the MCU or at the very least in Black Panther films going forward.<br/><br/>Here's to fighting and overcoming all forms of strife that cannot keep strong voices in the shadow! Always a war..."

"christophershobris","10","1","7","26 February 2018"," A Marvel Movie that Makes You Think
","As I reference in the title of this review this isn't your typical run-of-the-mill superhero movie, it truly is a kind of film that makes you think. Usually when I watch a movie I am able to give my thoughts on it pretty quickly but this one took me about a week after I watched the movie to be able to give an idea of what I thought about the film. The story and what takes place within the story which I think has great depth and emotion. I believe it was a genius move to introduce us to the character of Black Panther/T'Challa in the Captain America: Civil War as it allowed in the standalone movie to explore other realms and characters within the world of Wakanda. In Black Panther, the main character Black Panther isn't exactly the center of attention. All of the side characters are given layers and strength giving the film the greatest group of likable characters that I have seen in a film in a while. There isn't one weak or unnecessary character amongst them. The female characters in particular are very strong. Chadwick Boseman's performance as Black Panther/T'Challa is outstanding displaying an African ascent (considering he's American) and carries the film and makes the character his own. The characters of Black Panther/T'Challa is conflicted with family mistakes of the past while tending to the problems at hand. Anytime he gets into his suit; which happens only a few times; makes me excited. The world of Wakanda is the most beautiful world I've seen in a movie since Pandora in Avatar. The film wonderfully explains the world and how it all works making the world feel like a character itself. Michael B. Jordan who is a frequent collaborator of Ryan Coogler portrays the greatest villain in the MCU since Loki. His story turns this superhero film into not just that but also a very tragic Shakespearian-like storyline. A villain that we understand is someone we are supposed to dislike, but you can't help but feel somewhat sorry for Kilmonger. His motivations are completely understandable in why he does what he does. The music in this film is very good as well. All the drums help convey the African world and culture of the people. However, for as much as I love this film I do recognize some errors like all films do. Some people may think this has a very familiar story arc to that of other films. Some of the CGI is very noticeable and is disappointing considering its 2018, not 2003. Some shots are good while others are obviously noticeable. There was one fight scene near the beginning that was hard to make out because of shaky cam. I hate shaky cam and I was worried that this was going to be like this for the remainder of the film, but luckily it didn't, still that one scene was heavily compromised by the shaky cam. Overall, this is a very enjoyable film with beautiful music, characters, performances, and story elements that most of anyone will have fun watching. That is one word I can use to describe this film FUN. If you haven't seen this film yet give a chance and you may end up liking it."
"aydonaldson","8","1","7","22 February 2018"," More than just another Marvel movie...
","Honestly, I am not a huge Marvel fan. I am not into the whole superhero franchise and even the word ""Marvel"" in itself is to be filled with wonder and astonishment. To gaze in awe. Yeah....not really my thing. <br/><br/>However, in saying all of that I was coerced by my friends and family to really go see this movie. I am thinking to myself... okay another ""over-hyped"" superhero movie from Marvel Comics...here we go again. But to my amazement this movie transcends more than just another comic book-gone-movie stereotype.<br/><br/>1. If you are a Marvel fan you will enjoy it because of the comic books, Stan Lee (of course he makes an appearance) and just seeing the superhero come to life on the big screen.
2. For the African American community it speaks volumes on the state of ""black America"". The character Killmonger (played by Jordan) represents a lost culture, nation that was inevitably ""left"" by its true heritage. This would be inevitably in the form of slavery in which many Africans were brought to America and in that transaction (sold into slavery) lost their language, heritage, culture, their true self being. His anger, rage, monstrous attitude is the result of abandonment. What epitome's black America today. They lost their culture so inadvertently they are angry, upset, oppressed, and dangerous.
3. Wakanda represents the Kings and Queens and royalty that slaves (bought to America) came from. A country more advanced than any civilization. The Black Panther and his father and the Wakandans know how precious this is and will protect this with everything.....including their lives. 
4. The CGI was decent and the implementation of how advanced Wakanda was is exceptional. The usual depiction of African countries is third-world. I love how in the movie the Black Panther (Boseman) and Okoye (Gurira-she will always be Michonne from TWD to me) let the American (Freeman) believe that Wakanda is indeed a third world country to protect its resources and technology. She even makes a remark of the wig/weave that she has to wear in a scene is a disgrace! Just the actions and characteristics of a culture who lost its heritage and tries to imitate the European heritage because they do not have one themselves. I love it! 
5. Of course it's political. Anyone who comments and thinks that a movie (especially a Marvel movie) will not be political and have subliminal messages is unfortunately ignorant.
6. The great thing about this movie is that it's not a ""black film"" it's not just another superhero marvel film. It's a really decent film. Kids (and some adults) will love it for the CGI, graphics, fighting scenes, and the usual Marvel movie extremes. Adults (of all nationalities) will love it to see a culture created and sustained by technology and the advancement that is being used and just enter into knowing who the Black Panther character is and his origin. I can definitely see a series or at least a sequel in the works. There are so many avenues that this character can take as well as team up with the other Marvel characters to enhance this already large franchise. 
Overall, this is my synopsis of this film. Yes, I have included a few spoilers but I do want you to go and give this movie a chance. It's more than just another Marvel movie."
"sbcscott","8","1","7","21 February 2018"," Great movie but Regressive to Black rights.
","Last weekend I took in the much acclaimed movie Black Panther on a Saturday night here in Southern California. With the great reviews and a lover of Marvel Comic movies this was a no brainer. As expected the casting, cinematography, directing, set design and acting were all seemless and worked well with the story. In my estimation a solid B+. 
BUT........ The Racist, stereotype depiction of the black race I could not get over. <br/><br/>To those of you who have not seen it let me prepare you. 
In this movie an advanced secret black society in darkest Africa profits from the use of parts of a meteor that has fallen giving them power and technology (no mention of schools)... <br/><br/>Then the costumes... In this advanced Black society they wear loin cloths, carry and chuck spears, have large lip plates (colorful), wear brightly colored leisure suits, and adorn the walls of this magnificent city with LA style graffiti. Ironically, supreme power is attained by drinking from harvested ""flowers"" that give the recipient super human strength. Did I mention the hallucinations from the substance? 
Pretty much covering many negative stereotypes we are trying to shed. 
A ""Song of the South"" for a new generation. Do not take my word for it and see for yourself."

I gotta be honest, the story was still better than any of the Thor's movies. Thor Ragnarok was a flop, it wasnt an action movie, it was a comedy. Black Panther delivers what it's promising for sure. Entertainment: Is it funny? Yeah! Does it have a decent plot? Yeah! Stunning Visuals? OH YEAH!<br/><br/>I don't get what the problem is, you have to look at it from the perspective of MCU, This is a movie that is trying to achieve entertainment, it's not trying to make you cry because how good the story is."

","I can consider myself as a big fan of Marvel Cinematic Universe. In my opinion the phase 1 was boring, the phase 2 was fine and the phase 3 is being amazing.
I didn't know nothing about Black Panther before to watch it, but this movie is the proof of how great a PG-13 super hero film can be. The main story is really good, has small twists to keep the interest and memorable characters to make every single scene epic.<br/><br/>Some of the most points I love are: the costumes & the characters design (the creators deserve a nomination for the next Oscars), the action sequences are all incredible (the scene in South Korea is one of the best I've seen in a action film), and the soundtrack is amazing.<br/><br/>Rating: 8.5/10<br/><br/>I know it's an important masterpiece for the African people and I'm happy to see how Marvel could handle it with success. Now I hope they do movies with more people from different races, female leaders, and also with gay, bisexual and lesbian super heroes.
By the way, don't expect anything awesome for the credits scenes, they're just okay."

It takes years to be untaught such racism. This movie lifts them up and shows them as the proud, intelligent and strong people they are.

","'Black Panther (2018)' portrays a perspective so often missing from mainstream media and is refreshing because of it, a vibrant and celebratory vision of an oft overlooked culture infused with the sci-fi futurism inherent to the genre. It actually feels rather unique, despite some of its more 'superhero' genre elements, and is typically a smaller, more character-focused affair than its counterparts. The special-effects can be slightly overbearing at times, though; there are some digital body doubles that both look dodgy and do some dodgy things. Still, thanks to the brilliantly written screenplay, this doesn't really take away from the believability of proceedings because we're always invested in our hero, who's as incredibly tangible and entertainingly combat-capable here as he was in his debut appearance. The feature is thematically rich and, occasionally, emotionally moving, too. It's accomplished, enjoyable stuff that represents some of Marvel's (and the genre's) best work to date. 8/10"
"kjproulx","9","1","7","17 February 2018"," A Rich And Welcome Addition To The MCU
","The Marvel Cinematic Universe has now been around for nearly a decade and not only has it matured as a franchise, but it has also evolved into something worth holding onto for generations to come. Sure, there are a few weak entries, but I don't think of this franchise as a series of movies anymore. This is a fantastic television series that's presented on the big screen a few times each year, that's had a few mediocre episodes along the way. Happily, Black Panther is their latest entry and not only is it far from mediocre, but it's easily the best film they've produced in quite some time. Look, I'm not going to sugar coat this review and call myself a fanboy who's blinded by the brand of Marvel. I genuinely thought this was a terrific entry and here's why.<br/><br/>One of the best things about this film is that it stands on its own. Yes, seeing previous movies definitely elevates your experience, but it's been a long time since the Marvel Cinematic Universe released a movie that's not reliant on viewers having seen previous movies. That being said, Black Panther picks up not too long after the events of Captain America: Civil War. Don't let that be daunting to you or anyone who hasn't seen that film because this movie does a solid job at filling in the gaps without having to see that movie. The king of Wakanda has passed away and his son T'Challa has taken the mantle. With looming threats to have his throne stolen from him, he must take any precautions necessary in order to reign supreme. Quite honestly, unless you want this movie ruined for you, it's hard to expand on the premise itself, especially when it comes to the villain in Erik Killmonger.<br/><br/>Everyone will want to discuss how well Chadwick Boseman fits into the role of T'Challa (Black Panther), but Michael B. Jordan is easily the highlight of this film. Once again, I'm not trying to let a highlight cloud my judgment of the movie as a whole, but the villain is honestly something remarkable here, especially for the standards that have been set by previous movies in this universe. His purpose for wishing to take down the titular hero will have you hating him and sympathizing with him all at the same time and that's when you know this character was created and presented with care. The interacting with Killmonger and the secondary character and the final few scenes that he and T'Challa get to spend together are honestly some of the best moments from any of these films in a very long time.<br/><br/>Yes, I can admit that I loved this movie from start to finish, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the few aspects that bothered me. Normally when I watch a movie, I never let CGI affect how I feel about a scene as a whole, but there were some noticeably cheap-looking effects here. Now, that's really all I have to complain about here because it didn't take away from anything. They're definitely noticeable, but I also found myself invested and tearing up during a couple of the final scenes, even though someone's body or a background looked fake, so I have nothing but incredible applause for Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole on their fantastically written screenplay.<br/><br/>In the end, superhero movies, in general, are hard to make these days, especially when many audience members seem to be growing weary of them. Personally, I think of this genre as any other genre. If you make a good film, then it's worthy of talking about, just as an indie drama that's up for Oscars is. This is a rich and wonderful world that's worth exploring. Superbly directed by Ryan Coogler, Black Panther is one of the best films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and easily one of the best solo outings for a superhero.<br/><br/>Has there ever been romantic comedy fatigue? No. Has there ever been horror film fatigue? No. People let themselves think they're having superhero movie fatigue because there are many of them made nowadays, but as I said, it doesn't matter if people have powers. A great movie is a great movie if you have a story worth telling, and Black Panther proves that statement tenfold. I can't recommend checking this film out enough. For comics fans and average moviegoers alike, I feel as though this will be a movie long-discussed."

"Lost_In_Translation_","8","1","8","20 April 2019"," Culturally important, solid entry into MCU
","I worked at a theater when Black Panther came out. We thought it would be big as most Marvel movies are, but it ended up being 10x bigger that we planned on.<br/><br/>This movie is for sure one of the most culturally important movies to be released in the MCU. I will admit that aspect caused it to be a bit overrated in the long run, but it is still as great and solid entry into the MCU.<br/><br/>Black Panther was introduced in Civil War as a side character. It was clear he was going to have his own origin movie and Wakanda was finally going to appear in the MCU. This movie starts not too long after Civil War as T'Challa returns to Wakanda to be crowned King of his nation.<br/><br/>For a movie called Black Panther, honestly the lead is probably one of the weaker aspects of it. It's really his allies and the villain that shine in this movie. His sister and the head of the King's guard are easily the best two characters in the movie. They're really fun and lighten the mood what could be a painfully boring movie. The villain when he comes into light is probably the 2nd best MCU baddie after Thanos. Even Andy Serkis as Ulysses Claue makes a return from ""Age of Ultron"" and is so much damn fun to watch. It's really all the characters surrounding T'Challa that make this movie so entertaining. Without them, this movie would have been much worse off.<br/><br/>It has some really stellar action scenes, especially the casino/car chase in the middle. It's a shame that the final battle is so poorly done. I'm not sure if it was because Marvel wasn't sure if BP would do well, so they cut the budget on the CGI for the final battle, but it just wasn't up to snuff with other movies like Winter Soldier or Civil War. The CGI battle between Killmonger and T'Challa on the train tracks looked really bad.<br/><br/>Besides the lackluster finale, Black Panther is still a really great movie and a welcome change of pace in the MCU. It has a villain with real conviction and a great cast of side characters. Culturally, this movie was probably even bigger than Infinity War and it makes sense. It was just missing something to make it as top notch as Winter Soldier, Civil War, or Infinity War. I do hope for a sequel to improve upon this. Maybe a quality bump similar to Captain America 1 to 2."

"brianjohnson-20043","10","1","8","3 January 2019"," I really like it, but understand why others don't get the appeal.
","It's interesting to see all the mixed reviews of Black Panther. I'm in the I-love-it camp. But I understand how a lot of people could struggle to really love it as much as me.<br/><br/>I'd say that Black Panther's best quality is that it's more of a science fiction type movie remarking on real compelling global issues than a regular safe good heroes saving the world from selfish villains narrative. You know. The type of story where the villain knows or doesn't care that the plan is evil because its their nature to be proudly selfish. The foundation of Black Panther also isn't irreverent jokes and dazzling cinematic battles for the sake of visual aesthetic wonder. Black Panther has some solid quips and visuals. But I'd argue it has more of the science fiction elements than the regular superhero elements. And many people probably expected and were disappointed not to to experience the opposite.<br/><br/>For instance Black Panther being a superhero feels secondary to him being the king of Wakanda. I find this element of open leadership and responsibility great and appealingly more similar to the struggles of real heroes. But many people are going to prefer the other type of simple escape from reality story. I don't mind superhero movies of that type. I just find them inferior to a story like Black Panther's when done right.<br/><br/>The film has a few moments where it might be a bit too smarmy and proud of its progressive side. It also has a few silly moments which seem to exist merely for the sake of fitting within the Marvel Universe than supporting the Black Panther story.<br/><br/>But overall I find it to still be a great story and it feels like a Marvel movie one could appreciate even if one hasn't seen any of the other Marvel films. It has some great acting and character development. The cinematography, directing and pacing are great. As well as the score, costumes, and sets. The environment of Wakanda is very well developed as well.<br/><br/>Overall I'd say it's the best Superhero movie I've seen. It's innovative, but works because it adheres to a lot of basic effective movie principles. It doesn't try to invent new ingredients for storytelling, but it puts ingredients we're familiar with together in different ways to create a very appealing and distinct final creation. I'd a well deserved 10/10 in my book."

","I read the amazing Black Panther comic book in 98 under the Priest run and it was the best comic run I had ever read. Such a great political study of both Wakanda and American ideals. Obviously this film borrows heavily from that run as well as Hudlin and Coates. The fascinating thing about this movie is using it as a ""what if?"" moment. Will a nation prosper if they have unique resources that was kept a secret for year? Wakanda is a nation that did not fall into the perils of colonialism and overreliance of other nations or ""aid"". The character study of TChalla and Killmonger is just as engaging. They are two sides of the same coin as their objective is to create a better world for their people. Though their methods are drastically different. Killmonger is a villain that, as an African American, you understand completely where he is coming from. He is one of Marvel's greatest villain since he provides an interesting challenge for TChalla, not just physically but morally. Coogler did a great job balancing a movie as complex as this with a great action superhero film. The action is nothing to sneeze at since it was breathtaking in most scenes. There ARE some CGI problems here or there but it was still good, especially the casino fight with a great score pacing the scene. The supporting cast is strong, especially Shuri, a different character from the comics but still fascinating. Last, it is good that a movie portrays people of color and a nation in Africa, though fictional, in a more positive light instead of pirates or war lords."
"nickpazell1","9","1","8","2 March 2018"," An important film filled with beauty and culture
","Let me start off this review by mentioning that I am a white Mediterranean-American. That being said, I am a humble ally of the African American community and the black experience. I am a massive fan of the history and culture. And I have the great benefit of being included when it makes sense. I also have the responsibility to see myself out when it doesn't make sense. This film is an example of when it didn't make sense, it wasn't my story, or other lighter skinned or mixed raced people's story to tell. It was a story of people who have gone through great oppression, whose blackness isn't an awesome thing they get to throw on and be in the world. This was an opportunity for a beautiful and underrepresented portion of the black community, who is the heart of the black community, to have their story told and to be put center stage, and have that to be enough. And it was. Quickly I will say that on a superhero film level, it was excellent and beautifully made. Not the best Marvel film, but still a stellar movie to add to Marvel's tremendous library. But it's so much more then just a superhero flick. It's a film that the black community deserved, especially the portion depicted in the film. There really aren't many films depicting African culture in such a light. And it was a beautiful thing to see. There are only 2 main characters who are white in this film (Martin Freeman and Andy Sercis) and it is an interesting thing to see, and it makes you realize that there are so many films where there's only a limited number of black people. The tables were flipped and it was a necessary and interesting change that people need to see. There is so much culture packed into this film. From the colors, to the costume design, the face paint, the hair styles, the locations and scenery. I have felt this way about certain films before myself, as a gay man. Moonlight and Call Me By Your Name especially were very important to me. It was nice to see a gay man on screen, not being used as a stereotype or a joke machine. Just another human being with feeling. That's how I imagine the black community feels about this film. They are not being depicted as the key black side character, they are the heroes of the film and the culture is brought to the forefront. It's important for anyone to see someone on the screen in any film they can relate to and they can look at and realize that they themselves are beautiful and valuable. Another example of this could be Pixar's Coco. You could really see the impact it had on the Hispanic community, Disney does their research and it is something I appreciate and respect. 
This film is definitely worth buying a ticket to go see. I will most definitely be seeing it again. A great superhero film and an important film that I think will be the start to a necessary change we need."
"Charltonium","9","1","8","1 March 2018"," Totally Worth the Hype!
","For those who haven't seen the movie yet, I will shove all the spoilers toward the end of this review so that you can harmlessly read the first part of this review.<br/><br/>One reason why I am writing this review is because I am shocked about how much hate this movie is receiving - and it's a good movie too! I can understand everyone's hate against Star Wars: The Last Jedi (which was also critically acclaimed, but even I wasn't too impressed with that movie), but I'm less sure why so many people are ranting on this movie as well.<br/><br/>Here are some reasons why it's a good movie.<br/><br/>I'll start off with the plot. The plot was pretty straightforward and intact, and very captivating. True, there may be one or two minor plot holes, but the majority of it is still pretty connected and exciting. I will say though that some of the plot was predictable, however there were a couple parts that I found surprising (see spoiler section for more info).<br/><br/>Now I'll talk about the characters. The acting was decent, but not spectacular (except for Andy Serkis - I wouldn't be too surprised if he was Oscar nominated). The character development was great, however I felt like they could have had more development with the lead - I would occasionally feel more connection to the side characters than I would with T'Challa. But back to the positive side, I don't think I've ever seen greater chemistry among the characters than in any other movie I've ever seen; their relationships with one another was completely believable, for I love how they're always saluting and joking with each other. I personally consider Shuri to be my favorite side character.
Killmonger did make a better villain than other villains featured in the franchise. However, I won't consider him to be one of the greats (Red Skull, Loki, Ultron, Hela(?), Thanos), since he has less potential to be remembered in the long run. But I will say that he is properly developed, and his evil motivations are actually relatable. But I still think Klaue made the better villain, though (see spoiler section for more info).<br/><br/>The overall theme of the movie seems pretty distinct from other movies in the franchise. I will admit, though, that I was a little weirded out at first because of some of the tribal rituals, but over time I found myself enjoying the movie more and more as I went along. The cinematography was spot-on, the directing and screenwriting were also great, and the movie overall was action-packed and enjoyable.<br/><br/><br/><br/>SPOILERS EVERYONE!!! ONLY READ FURTHER IF YOU'VE SEEN THE MOVIE OR YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT SPOILING IT BEFOREHAND.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Going back to the plot, I mentioned before how it was partly predictable. Sure, it was totally predictable that Klaue would escape from custody (since the trailer itself spoiled that) and it was just as predictable to see that T'Challa had survived falling off the cliff. In addition, it was also very predictable that M'Baku and his tribe would join the fight at the end despite M'Baku declining T'Challa's plea for help (that was also spoiled by the trailer).
However, there were other parts of the plot that I found surprising. I was not expecting Killmonger to kill Klaue halfway through the movie (which I actually found disappointing, since I personally think that Klaue made the better villain). And though it was predictable that T'Challa would survive falling off the cliff, I found it surprising that M'Baku said that he already found and recovered him (I was expecting T'Challa to recover on his own and then he and his family would find each other). Also, I was half-expecting Agent Ross to die during the scene where he remotely pilots the plane to take out those other aircraft that were delivering vibranium (since he was under fire from his remote control spot), so I was somewhat surprised that he had enough time to take out all the aircraft AND escape before the lab was broken into.<br/><br/>There also was somewhat of a political message to it. For a long time, the Wakandans were very secretive and exclusive of their vibranium supply (and mostly about Wakanda itself), but when future controversies arose regarding it, T'Challa made the choice to defy his fathers' traditions and begin reaching out to the public. Killmonger had similar intentions, but he sought to do so in a tyrannical manner - by declaring war against the more powerful nations so that the smaller nations could prosper. T'Challa, on the other hand, chose to make a more peaceable approach to assisting other countries. I'm personally in full favor of this decision - we should all do our part to share our benefits with others, not in a socialist way, but in a way that shows that we want people to benefit the same way we're benefiting (however I trust that Wakanda will still be careful about their outreach, considering how their assets should not and cannot be trusted in the wrong hands)."

","Black Panther is easily one of the most talked about movies in recent memory. A lot of it stems from the fact that it's (debatably) the first mainstream blockbuster to have a predominantly Black cast, and also the first that deals with issues affecting Black people around the world. For a lot of people, this was more than just a movie. It was a cultural moment. That's completely understandable, given Hollywood's history of racism and underrepresentation. Black Panther broke all sorts of records, and reeled in over $200,000,000 opening weekend, in the U.S. alone. It's really making its mark, and for good reason.<br/><br/>It also helps that it's one of Marvel's best. After T'Challa (Black Panther) stole the show in Civil War, people were excited to see him in a story of his own. In this movie, he has become the king of Wakanda, an African nation that mines Vibranium (the stuff Captain America's shield is made of) to create extraordinary technology but disguises itself as an impoverished, third world country. T'Challa is conflicted about whether he should continue allowing Wakanda to thrive as an isolationist country or if he should use its wealth and technology to benefit the rest of the world. He begins to discover what kind of king he's going to be when the throne is challenged by Killmonger, a soldier who seeks to start worldwide uprising and bring it all under Wakanda. Killmonger was easily one of the best villains in the MCU, if not the best overall. He has a charismatic and patient side, but also a violent and aggressive side. Without giving too much away, his last on-screen appearance was a very good scene. The other characters were also pretty good. Shuri was fun to watch with all her technology. Okoye had some great fight scenes. Ross was a good comic relief. M'Baku was a good character. Andy Serkis is one of the best actors to play a villain. The list goes on. One of the best things about the movie is the way it builds the world. You don't need to be familiar with the comics to understand Wakanda, and its people, culture, and traditions are shown in great detail, making it fascinating to watch. Wakanda is beautiful, the people, the landscape, and the futuristic cityscape. It also helps that the movie's soundtrack, which ranges from traditional African music to orchestral movie music to rap and hip-hop, is absolutely fantastic. The blend of traditional and futuristic is evident in the film, with the combat shown ranging from swordfights to aerial battles that look like they're right out of Star Wars. The rituals shown involving T'Challa's coronation were great. He participates in ritual combat, and talks to his deceased father in the Ancestral Plane, which reminds me of The Lion King. That's actually a downside to the film, without giving too much away, it's strikingly similar to The Lion King in several different ways, not just because it's set in Africa. Black Panther still does it very well, though. The people show the different cultures of Wakanda, which are based on real African cultures. There are articles online that document the real life inspiration behind some of Black Panther's imagery, and are great reads.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Black Panther is an absolute masterpiece that has a great cast of memorable characters, an amazing world and culture within its setting, and a great albeit familiar story. This movie meant a lot for many people, and it was an absolute pleasure to see on the big screen. This one is very highly recommended."

","I was extremely impressed by Black Panther, and felt that it went beyond superficial action hero movie themes and quality. The technical aspects were excellent, with beautiful visuals, a great score, and good action. What really set Black Panther apart from other MCU movies was the consistency and the depth of themes discussed. The character arcs of T'Challa and Killmonger were both very well done, and all of the complex explanation of how Wakanda and the Black Panther came to exist were coherent and relatively clear. Many themes were well explored, such as African culture, isolationism, and ancestry. I didn't think the conflict development was anything special (felt like a simplified version of The Dark Knight Rises), and the climax was good, not great. Excellent ending and post-credit scenes do a great job of clearly showing how the story ties into the MCU without weighing down the movie by forcing references. All in all, a great movie, and one that's likely to be one of my favorites of 2018."
"MarkoutTV","8","1","9","3 March 2018"," As long as you didn't overhype yourself, it's very good
","This is the part where the pasty white guy says something dangerously close to: ""There's no way I could be racist. I have a black friend.""<br/><br/>So growing up in Brooklyn, some of my better friends have lived their lives constantly effected by the remnants of institutionalized racism and racism in general. And denying that racism has infected all walks of life, including Hollywood, and continues to do so, is to be perpetuating a fallacy. You need to have some bulletproof blinders on in order to believe anything else. Under-representation of black culture and whitewashing is an easily traceable pattern in Hollywood. Multiple black actors is a rare sight in a film, unless the film is about sports or slavery. I agree that the overly PC culture we live in can go too far in it's demands for ""social justice"" and in it's outrage where it isn't truly warranted, but facts are facts and the annoying nature of some ""SJWs"" doesn't alter said facts.<br/><br/>Now, as a middle class white man who grew up seeing racial injustice but never truly living through it, I found the idea of a Marvel super hero movie set in Africa and consisting nearly entirely of black main and supporting actors refreshing and interesting. However, for my friends it was far more than that. It was a source of pride and extreme emotional investment. Even now just looking at their Facebook wall you would see the positive impact that the very existence of this film has on their lives and continues to do so. And that's a beautiful thing. I want every movie I watch to have that effect on me and am thrilled when a movie, even one I don't personally like, has that effect on anyone.<br/><br/>However, that emotional impact, those Facebook posts, the glowing reviews and everything else surrounding this film's release, as happy as it made me for people I care about, is the exact reason I waited a little bit to watch it. Because this movie had all the hype in the universe, and hype culture is a terrible thing with no true benefit to any moviegoer. If you hype yourself into thinking a movie's going to be a 10, and it's a 9, you will be disappointed. If you go in thinking it will be a 5, and it's a 6, you'll be pleasantly surprised. I had to go back into ""5"" mode before I decided to see this.<br/><br/>So I managed to go into this film with weathered expectations and a constant mind to the things I typically don't like about Marvel films, instead of the hype. Even though I love the idea of this film and am happy that it's an overwhelming triumph financially, none of it mattered to me if it didn't succeed as a film on it's own merits.<br/><br/>It did.<br/><br/>The movie has the three main problems that I have with all Marvel movies: too long, CGI porn and containing bad one liners that take the drama away from a scene. However this movie was one of the lesser offenders in the MCU in those regards. There's only one or two of the lame drama-cutting jokes (and although this joke wasn't of that variety, any ""what are those"" jokes deserve to rot in the deepest circle of hell). To boot, although the movie felt a tiny bit long, looking back I can't think of any particular thing that could have been cut. I originally thought the Oakland stuff could have been cut, but they paid that stuff off in a big way at the end. I originally though the ""challenge"" scene didn't need to be there, but it served as a lesson in a Wakandan culture and provided context to later events, so no problem there. Ultimately I can't complain too much about the length. And it's a Marvel movie so CGI porn is CGI porn and it's there and there can't be much done about it. However the warrior culture and natural backdrops of Wakanda make for much more clear and enjoyable battle scenes overall.<br/><br/>The story here is simple but effective: T'Challa is a new King after the death of his father. With the changing landscape of the world, the discovery of a stolen artifact and the eventual arrival of Killmonger, he is emburdened with the question of whether Wakanda's technology should be shared with the world, a new threat and the realization of his father's greatest failing. The movie is paced well, makes sense, is greatly performed, the score is excellent and best of all the isolationist nature of Wakanda meant the film wasn't burdened with gratuitous references to other Marvel movies, much like how the setting of Wonder Woman worked in it's favor.<br/><br/>I knew Chadwick Boseman was a great actor and an excellent Black Panther after his previous turn as him in Civil War, but whether he could carry the main duties in a film was yet to be seen, and he was great here. Emotional yet powerful, serious yet charismatic, and believable. He has great chemistry with all of his co-stars and really fits the bill as a leading man. Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger continues to check marks on his rise to superstardom, creating something as rare as a unicorn: a compelling villain in a Marvel movie. His upbringing is laid bare and it makes his pain, anger and motivation completely understandable. He isn't trying to take over Wakanda because ""I'm the antagonist""; he's doing so because he wants both revenge on the world, and in his own mind, to save it. In the context of the film, you definitely feel for him. Also as a child raised in Oakland California in the 90s, his juxtaposition with the African people of Wakanda makes for an intriguing contrast.<br/><br/>The supporting cast members are all noteworthy in their own right. I especially enjoyed Letitia Wright as Shuri. She was the funniest castmember, often quick with a one-liner that lands, and never obnoxiously so save for that ""what are those"" travesty. She never felt like a caricature or a stock ""funny"" character. Just a witty character with a sense of humor. Later in the film, when she had to be serious, she was.<br/><br/>In the end, even ignoring the poison to balanced expectations that is hype culture, what you have with Black Panther it a well-paced, well-acted and well-told story and a bona-fide standout among Marvel movies, limiting the little annoyances that plague most of them. If there is an extra emotional element to you personally, even better."
"MorpheusRU","8","1","9","1 March 2018"," The view from an old, intellectual white guy who isn't into Marvel comix or movies
","Browsing user reviews, I see many jaded Marvel aficionados were not impressed by this offering. I would guess most of them are relatively young white guys. Being a relatively old white Star Wars guy, never having read a Black Panther comic and having seen only one X-Men movie (I did read X-Men comix in their early days), I'm looking at Black Panther, the movie, from a very different perspective, one shaped by the Vietnam War and Civil Rights struggles, the long view historical context (e.g., 18th Century colonialism, the self-destruction of four empires in WW1 and the undoing of the remnants of European dominance following WW2, the Cold War, Vietnam, the fall of the USSR, the wrong-headed adventures of US neo-conservatives leading to a destabilized Middle East, and the rise of China as the next superpower), 20th Century rock, cinema and literature, etc. Having found the media hype intriguing, I approached Black Panther with an open mind, viewing it as a standalone expression of pop culture. I would imagine the negative reviewers who panned the film or damned it with faint praise, will view my review as way out of touch. No problem, bring it.<br/><br/>From my vantage point, the film is a tour de force of fantasy action adventure and an audiovisual powerhouse. The costumes alone of the citizens of the small African kingdom of Wakanda are well worth the price of admission. The best of Star Wars has nothing on the special effects. The throbbing African rhythms alternating with hip hop beats and ranks of male and female warriors slamming their spears to the ground in unison keep the viewer in a prolonged state of excitement. The film features a full range of thrills- single combat between heroic African martial artists, armies clashing with primitive weaponry backed up by armored dragonfly air support and tank-like rhinos, high tech cars chasing a convoy of MRAP (mine resistant, ambush protected) SUVs and wreaking havoc on hapless civilian traffic through Seoul, South Korea, dramatic appearances of the superhero, Black Panther, in his transforming body suit that absorbs kinetic energy from various projectiles and channels it back toward criminal aggressors, ultra-high speed trains flashing along elevated tracks through the hidden, futuristic capital of Wakanda, to name a few. Reviewers who think some or all of this is ridiculous are forgetting something: magical realism.<br/><br/>However, the most compelling aspect of Black Panther is the thought-provoking script, brilliantly manifested cinematically though it is. The premise of Black Panther, a hidden paradise of scientifically advanced black Africans disguised as a poor third world backwater in order to prevent everyone else on the planet from realizing what they have and disrupting their idyllic way of life, is an extremely ingenious flipping of the contemporary geo-political reality, i.e., a small set of advanced countries in Europe, Asia and the Americas fending off incursions from the masses of disadvantaged and resentful descendants of oppressed minority groups and colonial subjects who would like to enjoy the health, wealth and opportunities of their current and former masters. In the movie, some of the elite of Wakanda, including a king's brother, are anguished by the plight of their black cousins in Africa as well as the USA. These Wakandans believe their country should use its vast but secret power to intervene on behalf of the oppressed of the world and create a more just global order. The king, a conservative traditionalist, considers this a betrayal and puts a stop to his brother's plans, setting off a generational revenge cycle that threatens to upend Wakanda's idyllically detached society and set their devastating technological power against the ruling princes and oligarchs of the Earth. Unbeknownst to those complacent elites, their fate hangs in the balance as the sons of the old king and his brother face off to determine whether Wakanda will remain a wary but hidden observer of their abuses and machinations or a stalking jungle predator coming to devour them in their sleep. <br/><br/>Perhaps many viewers of Black Panther who respond favorably will enjoy it for its dazzling surface of beauty, action and drama. I certainly did. Those who go a little deeper and consider the ironies and implications of the story it tells (for example, Wakanda's radical anti-immigration and isolationist policies vs. the social conscience of the antagonists), will find food for thought. Is the idealistic resolution of the core conflicts satisfying? You be the judge."

"JasonR77","10","1","10","21 February 2018"," Best MCU Film Yet
","A common thread in Marvel films has been how past actions, before the hero has his power, come back around to present consequences. Black Panther is no exception. In the same way that Tony Stark's behavior when he was a party boy caused him problems many years later, T'Challa's fathers decisions from his youth have reprecussions on his son's, and country's, future.<br/><br/>Wakanda presents itself as practically a utopia, as its citizens have built incredibly upon its supply of Vibranium and the skills of its warrior kings. We see T'Challa ascend the throne, as we expected after the events of Civil War, and the challenges that come along with such a role.<br/><br/>While Chadwick Boseman is a strong, capable lead who creates a sympathetic and intriguing lead character, the true stars of this film for my money are Shuri and Killmonger. Shuri isn't just the wiseguy support character that so many of the people that provide technical help to a hero is. She is a strong, vital woman in her own right who makes a difference in multiple ways, and is a pleasure to see appear on screen. Nakia and Okoye can also make these claims; they are also much stronger than many female characters are allowed to be, even within the MCU, and they too light up the screen and provide great support to the story.
Killmonger has been receiving a great deal of praise as the best MCU villain to date, and it's hard to disagree. His history is replete with violence and intellect, and he has found a way to combine those two to become a powerful force when he goes to settle his grudge. He speaks intelligently, with conviction, and with firm and complex ideas about what he intends to do. He does this all while initially seeming like an average American. Michael B. Jordan as such turns in easily the best performance of a villain this side of Loki, and elevates the film each time he is on screen.<br/><br/>This is a more serious film from start to finish than most Marvel films lately; it is grounded, and while still flashing that trademark wit, and fun action set pieces that we've come to expect, its true strength is found between the lines with well-written characters and an interesting plot that can keep even the most casual Marvel fan transfixed.<br/><br/>Now is the time to talk about the cultural impact of this movie. The convention of films with primarily African-American cast members being unreliable in box office terms is surely shattered now. This film has helped show those that would claim to be experts that it doesn't matter what color the skin of the cast is, if the movie is good, people will see it.<br/><br/>There is so much black culture evident in the threads of this film, from its opening to its closing scenes, and even at least one of the post-credit scenes. The inescapable nature of trying to improve their lot in the world, and what role they should take, is woven throughout, and presents numerous conflicts that only serve to make the film as a whole even better. Ryan Coogler deserves all the praise he is getting for creating such a thematically strong film that transcends its genre while still managing to be a great part of it.<br/><br/>Infinity War is coming soon, and following it and Avengers 4, it is sure that T'Challa and Wakanda will be a huge part of the next phase of the MCU. I, for one, am eager to see how things shake out, and will be ready to plant my butt in a seat for Black Panther 2, whenever it happens."

The action scenes were fantastic and the visuals were breathtakingly stunning.

","Well, it's not surprising that Avengers: Infinity War is going to become one of the biggest box office successes in cinema history. This film has been out for less than a week and already pretty much everyone who goes to the cinema has seen it, except for me. I haven't seen it yet because I don't get the urge to do what everyone else is doing. So, I'll probably wait until I can borrow it from some library. I actually like the films that Marvel makes, but I don't jump up and down every time one of those films is released. My favorite MCU films are Thor (2011), Ant-Man (2015), Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Doctor Strange (2016), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), and Thor: Ragnarok (2017). Pretty much all the Marvel films are enjoyable, but the ones that I've listed are my favorites. The recently released Black Panther isn't one of my favorites. It's not a bad film by any means. It's good. It's more serious that the usual Marvel flick. It's just that only a few characters in the film appeal to me. The film also doesn't quite have the emotional weight that it should have. When it comes to the characters, it lacks the appeal of Thor or of Iron Man, for example. Since Marvel films contain some Anglo-American propaganda, it can also be interesting to see them because of what they're about. Some of the information in these films actually surprised me. For example, in Captain America: The First Avenger, the fictional terrorist organization Hydra uses some odd weapons and technology. Steve Rogers (Captain America) doesn't fight against regular German troops in the film but against Hydra troops armed with extraordinary weapons. Such weapons are usually the stuff of science-fiction, but I later learned that the Nazis did actually have some of those extraordinary weapons. Some of this technology and weaponry wasn't intended for mass production and some of it wasn't fully developed when Nazi Germany was defeated. So, for example, the Germans did have plans to create the Amerikabomber, which was a long-range strategic bomber for the Luftwaffe that would be capable of striking the USA from Germany. In the film, the Red Skull attempts to use a similar bomber to strike the USA. At one time, Adolf Hitler considered the creation a giant tank not so different from the one that the Red Skull uses in the film. So, if the Germans hadn't been defeated in World War II, such ""miracle weapons"" would have become a reality already in the 1940s or the 1950s. In the sequel, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, we find out that some members of Hydra were recruited by the American espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D after World War II. Something similar happened in real life too because the Americans did bring German and other European scientists, psychiatrists, and agents to the United States after World War II. Some of these people, like Ukrainian nationalists, were so-called war criminals because they were engaged in mass killings in Europe.<br/><br/>When it comes to what I've been reading lately, I can recommend Paul Kennedy's book 'The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers' (1987). It's a history book with some good information that was recommended by the historian Andrei Fursov. I finally finished listening to The Idiot by Fyodor Dostoyevsky a few months ago. It's a thick book, and I had to listen to it for about 25 hours. I'm now listening to the Complete Stories of Sherlock Holmes (in 3 volumes) by Arthur Conan Doyle. The narration is by Charlton Griffin, and I've got to say that I'm really enjoying listening to these releases. It's not only that the narration is very good, it's that I haven't yet read any of the Sherlock Holmes stories. Therefore, this is something that's new for me. Since Doyle was a Mason and a member of the British establishment, his novels contain some interesting information about British intentions in the second half of the 19th century. Another book that I'm almost finished listening to is Dispatches by Michael Herr. Dispatches was one of the first pieces of American literature that portrayed the experiences of soldiers in the Vietnam War for American readers. Herr's book is surprisingly funny at times, though he mostly describes the behavior of American soldiers and their actions. Carl Sagan's The Dragons Of Eden, which is another book that Fursov recommended, is an interesting read. I got The Dragons Of Eden right after I've read Sagan's well-known 1985 novel Contact, which is one of the more memorable hard science fiction novels that I've read. I personally prefer to read books on my tablet, by using the app Play Books. Other times, when I feel like it, I buy books at second hand book stores. But, for the most part, I read books on Play Books or I listen to them on the Audible app.<br/><br/>Some of the novels that I've already read are Inherit The Stars (1977), which is a personal favorite, Blood Music (1985), The Visitors (1980), The Robots Of Dawn (1983), Titan (1979), Beyond The Blue Event Horizon (1977), Mission Of Gravity (1954), The Godwhale (1974), Triton (1976), In The Ocean Of Night (1977), Ender's Game (1985), and Dune (1965). When it comes to Dune by Frank Herbert, I'd recommend getting the unabridged audiobook narrated by Scott Brick and Orlagh Cassidy, among others. I'm not at all a fan of Frank Herbert's work, and his science fiction novels aren't among my favorites, but the audiobook is a compelling listen that includes music and sound effects. Although I'm still reading the manga Berserk by Kentaro Miura (I'm now reading the 16th volume), I've finished reading Battle Angel Alita by Yukito Kishiro a few months ago. I've already read famous manga like Rurouni Kenshin, Death Note, Maison Ikkoku, Akira, Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind, and Fullmetal Alchemist, but Battle Angel Alita is hard to get because it has been out of print for years. Therefore, you can read it only on the internet or on an app for now. I've thought about reading it for several years, way before I knew that there was talk of adapting it into a film. Sure, the artwork is the biggest draw, but there's also a pretty good story that includes the theme of social control. Battle Angel Alita: Last Order is the continuation of the story that features more of Kishiro's fantastic artwork."
"bfml-03018","10","1","13","14 January 2019"," Isn't an overrated film
","Black Panther knows how to create good characters with at least some trait and personality. T' 'chala is a hero and a good man but that doesn't means he's perfect and without conflicts. Nakia, okoye and shuri have their own personality and conflicts or convictions. Killmonger is a good villain with personality and real motivations.
About the politics: this is part of the movie inside it own rules. Wakanda wasn't beeing free to the world and the whole thing is about that and killmonger wanted this because of they killing his father and don't helping the persons he saw suffering and did too. Wakanda has every resource to help the outside world and the discussion is if they will and how will.
Beyond that, black panther brings a cultural celebration and is everything part of the movie.
The only flaws are the action and the cgi in the end. But because those people complaining about the politics saying nonsense thing I'll give a 10/10. It was for be a 9/10."

Most of these people are racist in their feelings about an all black cast. Not giving away any spoilers, but Panther is a thrill ride from start to finish. If you love the Marvel series of movies, you will enjoy Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman gave a convincing performance at Panther, the King of Wakanda people. Danai Gurira, from the walking dead fame, is excellent as always. There is something empowering watching Okoye kick butt with her arrows and swords, guns are for punks. Overall, I would recommend this film. Again, don't pay attention to the 1 star rating. At the least Panther deserved 5 stars. Any 1 star rating is sour grapes from the usual racist in America that caused the message board on IMDB to close down. Black Panther is a must see for all the Marvel fan lovers."

"regula1","7","1","17","16 February 2018"," A culturally important film, but a fairly paint-by-numbers MCU film
","We finally get a peek behind the curtain at the mythical Wakanda, a nation and its protector the Black Panther, that have been hinted at and built up since Age of Ultron (or even earlier, if you count the Easter egg in Iron Man 2), and while this film does not fail to provide us with great action scenes and vibrant culture scenes, as well as probably the most interesting Marvel villain since Loki in Killmonger, I can't help but feel slightly disappointed.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong: every scene with Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa is near perfect, both inside the Black Panther suit and out.<br/><br/>His story in this film picks up a short time after the events of Captain America: Civil War, where his father King T'Chaka was killed in Vienna, and T'Challa must ascend to the throne of Wakanda. But, other forces are pushing him in a darker direction, and he must choose what kind of a king he must be.<br/><br/>The film shines whenever we get to see T'Challa interact with his fellow cast members. Whether it be with Forrest Whittaker's character, Zuri, an elder statesman and friend of T'Chaka, or T'Challa's sister Shuri, played beautifully by Letitia Wright, Chadwick Boseman seems to have good chemistry with just about everyone.<br/><br/>The film also boasts a great villain in Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger. While his performance may feel only a hair more than one-note, his character development and motivations are some of the most compelling in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Much like Loki, the conflict derives from a family connection. Unlike Loki, his cause is something you can actually see yourself supporting to some degree.<br/><br/>Where this film falters, at least in my view, is in the seeming lack of character development in almost anyone else in the film. Aside from T'Challa, his friend and ex-lover Nakia, played by Lupita Nyong'o, is the only one who has an easily identifiable character arc. Everyone else seems to stay in their own little bubbles, which is fine for some, but those who probably should have developed but didn't is a little frustrating.<br/><br/>Also lacking is the seeming paint-by-numbers of the whole thing. The action scenes are impressive and there are the occasional jokes that land almost always, but it just feels a little too self-serious in its delivery, and when it tries to be light-hearted or semi-silly (mainly the scenes with Andy Serkis's Ulysses Klaue) it's jarring to say the least, mostly because it feels very forced.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this film is without a doubt a culturally important film, and true to form the Marvel Cinematic Universe has yet to produce a truly bad film. However, I still rank Captain America: The Winter Soldier and the first Iron Man ahead of this one."

I understand why this movie is ""important""...and that's great...but that does not automatically make this a good film. I did enjoy some things - the history of Wakanda, the basic concept of the ""Black Panther"" in general, and the fact it didn't seem like every other MCU flick was a welcome change.

","I can't fully accept all the negativity over this movie, nor the abundance of one star reviews that all pretty much state the same cliched reasons, no story, poor special effects. I didn't have an issue with either, the story was fine to me and the effects were great, I'm not sure what movie or what version a lot of these one star votes were watching, but it seems that the hatred is just clutching at straws. As is the other bugbear some have with the soundtrack, I mean really?<br/><br/>I do feel that Black Panther was overrated and unnecessarily hyped but given the cast, the environment it's set in and the current political climate, particularly in the U.S, it was always going to be a vehicle for various agendas, so it was never going to be received as just another Marvel movie. Much in the same way that the O.J Simpson trial was never just another trial. However I easily looked past all that and just enjoyed the movie. I expected mostly black actors, it is set primarily in Africa as he is an African superhero, but according to some, they liked him better in Civil War rather than this. I guess that it's easier on the eye seeing a black actor surrounded by white people than the alternative in Black Panther. As for the humour, I wasn't aware that every Marvel movie had to be a laugh riot. They attempted that with Thor Ragnarok and people hated it, there was less humour in this and yet, people still hated it, so you're damned if you do and equally damned if you don't. There was enough humour in this to generate a few laughs in the cinema, so again, what version were a lot of these people watching? The car chase scene through the streets of Korea was great as well as entertaining and funny in parts, so I can't help but feel that people are voting this down for nitpicking reasons as opposed to their real reason, which ultimately wouldn't be allowed on IMDB.<br/><br/>The one thing I do agree with is the lack of any real villain but it doesn't automatically make the movie boring, it fits in nicely with the rest of the MCU.

No, I don't think it's essential. But it's a fun spin-off. The story wasn't incredible or anything and the villain Killmonger was perhaps a bit underwhelming (although I liked Jordan's performance, Killmonger simply isn't a Venom, Green Goblin or Magneto).

","Black Panther is a superhero movie that, for the most part, isn't about superhero stuff like saving the world. In a way it's a movie that makes the case for a superhero ethic.<br/><br/>Black Panther is a king of Wakanda, an advanced technological nation that tells the world it's a third-world African country in order to stay under the radar. Because of the charade, Wakanda does little for earth, hoarding its technology and resources and leaving the rest of the world to manage without it. Much of the film isn't about being a hero; it's about the hunt for a criminal.<br/><br/>For a good chunk of the time, the movie focuses more on interpersonal drama and world-building than action. This world-building is impressive; Wakanda seems like a very real place, offering an African nation that combines, like other high tech countries like Japan, ancient traditions with modernity. It's a country that shows little influence from the west.<br/><br/>This is also a movie that, like Mad Max: Fury Road, has a ton of strong women. Outside of the star, the heroes are women, and with a minor exception, all the bad guys are men (including a terrific Andy Serkis).<br/><br/>Outside of a wonderful chase scene, all the really great action comes in the end, with a massive, lengthy battle on multiple fronts that is electrifying throughout."

Now my favorite character , killmonger of course , it's no surprise Michael b jordan is in every Ryan coogler movie . This movie felt very isolated from the rest of the mcu movies , sure movies like Thor Ragnarok have introduced us to new worlds. But wakanda is just so magnificent and isolated from the rest of the mcu . This movie has a soundtrack that is so good you can buy the vinyl stereo CD for it . The score is a rush of adrenaline and has a lot of goosebumps along. This movie gave off the vibe of lion King in a lot of places and had a lot of cliches like the ""fallen King shall rise"" sort of ones. But unlike any other hyped movie , It has phasing issues , but the last act makes up for all the slow scenes. In the end , black panther was awesome ! It had great characters , nail biting action , and in a very long time in superhero movies , the bad guy has a great motive. In short it's blood diamond meets batman ."

","Black Panther is a very standard super hero flick from Marvel.<br/><br/>In terms of this movie itself, it's fairly bland. Nothing offensive or inventive. The production value is great, albeit some very poor CGI in the final battle scene. The protagonist once again suffers from what I call ""Marvel Syndrome"", where the character is rigid and doesn't have a personality. He is just there on the screen, reacting to things happening to him. He has no real agency or persona.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the cultural significance of this film with nearly all black cast and black talents behind the camera is immeasurable to many modern day movie viewers. Not to take credits from the cast and crew of this film, I would not consider this as a cultural milestone for black community or people of color in general.

"Jackbv123","6","0","1","9 May 2019"," Magic metal
","It seems like Marvel movies are intent of developing invincible villains and heroes to stand against them through some combination of extraterrestrial god powers, magic, or incredible technology. In this case, it is a magical herb and a magical metal. We've seen vibranium before but now they've added magical healing powers and who knows what else. Throw in the fact that a relatively small nation has hidden technology that appears to be dozens, if not hundreds, of years ahead of the world. And I don't even want to talk about the political undertones.<br/><br/>Kudos for not having scenes that fictionally destroy millions upon millions of dollars of infrastructure and vehicles not to mention potential lives in major cities. There is still plenty of cold-blooded killing and a villain whose only character trait is hatred. When the big bad battle takes place, it's fought with weapons that appear on the outside to be medieval technology but really pack a futuristic whollop.<br/><br/>The action and graphics are first rate, as always with Marvel. The acting is stilted for the most part. There is a story, but it's a pretty old one with no surprises.<br/><br/>The movie also avoids one of my pet peeves with several of the latest Marvel movies. I have complained elsewhere that I want my superheroes to be like the old-fashioned Superman - people with integrity.

"niesen-67805","6","0","1","5 May 2019"," High Expectations with a Bad Delivery
","Black Panther was released in January of 2018 and is the sixteenth film in the Marvel Comics film series that originated with Captain America: The First Avenger and has progressed through to Avengers: Endgame. I expected Black Panther to be a face paced action packed film with a countless amount of physical actions shots but ended up having a surprisingly slow to start to the film. In comparison to its predecessors in the Marvel series, I expected a great film but was let down and only got about fifty percent of what I had hoped the film would be.
Black Panther was written by Stan Lee, directed by Ryan Coogler, and produced by Kevin Feige being released in the United States by Marvel Studios. Chadwick Boseman played the main character T'Challa or better known as the Black Panther, and his rival Erik Killmonger who was also his cousin was played Michael B. Jordan. Throughout Black Panther, Killmonger and Black Panther had a disturbed complex human relationship because Black Panther's father T'Chaka played by John Kani abandoned Killmonger after his Uncle Zuri played by Forest Whitaker killed Killmonger's father.
The conflict between Black Panther and Killmonger was not immediately recognizable but became the focus of attention when Killmonger returned to Wakanda to challenge King T'Challa for the throne to rule over the five tribes of Wakanda. Another integral character throughout the film was General Okoye played by Danai Gurira who was the leader of the Dora Milaje Tribe who was responsible for the guarding and protection of Wakanda and the royal family.
During the film, it was very prevalent that a decent amount of the action sequences was set during the nighttime or indoors with dark and shadowy backgrounds and the slower paced shots were filmed in a bright and colorful setting. Being that the movie is titled Black Panther, I expected a darker scene setting but the amount of dimly lit scenes detracted from the overall colorfulness that Wakanda presented. Black Panther had a short timespan with the cutting speeds between the shots and utilized the parallel cut to bounce back and forth between the action scenes. This took place during the car chase scene alternating between the lab in Wakanda and the South Korean streets. The parallel cut was utilized during the flying towards the back half of the film. The longest cutting speed during the film was the slow-motion scene when Killmonger was watching the ship disappear with the killers of his father. The slow-motion aspect of the scene was important to show the abandonment of the young Wakandans child by his fellow Wakandans.
Overall Black Panther was a necessary part of the Marvel Film Universe, but it lacked the excitement and action pack sequences of the films in the series. Another downfall of Black Panther was the lack of explanation of how the berries and flowers gave him his powers. I am not a reader of comic books, and this could be why I did not understand the little nuances of the film."

","Black Panther (2018), directed by Ryan Coogler and produced by Kevin Fiege, is based on a Marvel Comic character with the same name. I saw many critics love this movie: 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, 88 points in Metacritic and a fair 7.3 from IMDb (I think that's too low, is it?). It also was one of the best MCU movies I've ever seen.
There was Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa/Black Panther, Michael B. Jordan was the main antagonist, Killmonger, Letitia Wright as Shuri, T'Challa's younger sister, Danai Gurira as Okoye, Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia and Winston Duke as M'Baku. They acted good on the movie making the characters unforgettable, usually making funny jokes and I laughed for some time. Killmonger almost topped the greatest villain in the MCU but no, there's a few ones which were better like Thanos, Ultron or even Loki. He's just number 4 on my list. He's pretty badass though and made a better villain than Ulysses Klaue.
The acting suited the plot really well, and the Black Panther comic was well-chosen for the plot of the movie making both audiences and critics love it. Everything was awesome there.
I definately loved the action sequences. They were really EPIC with some Wakandan technology, usually made from Vibranium (especially the Black Panther suit). There were explosions everywhere which made the battle look more like a war. Though I really didn't like one stupid decision done in here, and that is T'Challa's father, T'Chaka's fault for abandoning the child, Killmonger but then I understood without that stupid decision, there wouldn't be a great villain in here and the movie couldn't get any better without that kind of villain. The CGI was definately good. Without CGI, there wouldn't be Wakanda, no vibranium, no high-tech gears and it may be the worst of MCU if they don't have CGI.
One of the best things about Black Panther was the Original Score. Thanks to Ludwig Goransson, we couldn't have a great Black Panther movie without him and he impressively deserved an Oscar for Best Original Score. The soundtrack made us feel about Wakanda, all its technology and the score was also suitable for the movie because of its Africaness (I made up that word Lol).
I would say that Black Panther's highly rated by audiences and critics for its role-credits and movie editings. They worked really hard for the movie and it was nominated for Oscars' Best Picture. In my opinion, Black Panther's one of the greatest MCU movies and it also deserved a high rating from me.
Points: 9.1/10"
"benjamincallinicos","6","0","3","1 May 2019"," Slightly overrated but still good, Michael B Jordan steals the show!
","I'll be perfectly honest, Black Panther is a good superhero movie in it's own right, but is it Oscar worthy? Maybe, maybe not.<br/><br/>It has good actors, a decent story and very impressive visual stylings but the CGI is really clunky in some places and the pacing really does tend to fall off in places, plus some of the jokes fall flat in this.<br/><br/>The main thing that really saves this movie is Killmonger played by Michael B Jordan, he was once the Human Torch in Fan4stic but that movie failed miserably in 2015, now he has redeemed himself as one of the best Marvel movie villains, so compelling and so wonderfully performed. This guy deserves an Oscar for certain!<br/><br/>But I want to keep this brief as I don't want to be too controversial as I know that this film is really beloved by millions of people around the world and has a real cultural significance on the entire world.<br/><br/>It's not a movie that I want to rewatch over and over again but I do like the character of Black Panther and Chadwick Boseman plays him really well."

"iguth","7","0","2","29 April 2019"," Overhyped
","Black Panther was in my opinion overhyped by the media at release. This is in part because of it's nearly all black cast. First, the fight scenes for the throne have great visual effects and a great environment, however, those scenes are so over-exposed and take over the scene in my opinion. Our main character is unfun and he doesn't create any meaningful emotional bonds throughout the film. Not only is the main character not funny, but none of the jokes are; zero of the jokes hit. The movie has a really good pace and works well as a movie, but NOT as a superhero movie. As a hero, the Black Panther is one of the least epic heroes of the whole MCU. Because of his distinct lack of crazy abilities the ending cannot put him in any insane situations. Killmonger is a well-acted villain but has a master plan with very little threat. The distribution of weapons, while dangerous, does not hold the same weight as other superhero movies. Most hero movies have a villain who either threatens the lives of millions/billions immediately, or threatens the hero's family/friends. T'challa has no relationships to exploit and no big powers to stop the end of the world leaving the ending lackluster."
"grantbullert","6","0","1","25 April 2019"," Semi-Enjoyable Action Flick
","""Black Panther"" relies on it's cool title character and somewhat interesting fight scenes in order to reach success.<br/><br/>-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The script is poorly written, simply put. The pacing is terrible and the story is uninteresting. Give it a few decades when Marvel has completely lost its control of the general populous, and nobody will be talking about this film. Its very foundation is problematic. It was supposed to be a fantastic film raising up Black Americans (and black culture in general). However, it made the main villain a Black American. This is a serious issue for a film that is supposed to be inclusive and bring people together. It does have a cast of mostly Black actors, which is fantastic, but as far as storytelling goes I think the Black community deserved a much better film. And Marvel fans in general deserved a better film. Ryan Coogler completely missed the mark on this one. *Cinematography/Editing: The film looks a little bit too digital, as do most Marvel films. This causes me to get taken out of the film a bit. It feels more like a video one would find on YouTube, and not a film coming from a massive studio. I'm not sure how much say cinematographer Rachel Morrison had over the look of the film, but it is not her best work. It all feels a little cheap and gimmicky. The editing is sub-par. Action sequences that are not CGI are full of quick cuts which doesn't allow us to see much action actually happening. There is one long-take fight scene but it looks very sloppy. *Dialogue/Acting: The dialogue is incredibly lacking and cringe-worthy. Many lines produced a large number of eye rolls. ""What are those!?!"" comes to mind. The acting was less than impressive. Boseman doesn't have enough charisma to lead a film. Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman phone in their performances, as does Michael B. Jordan. Jordan's performance feels terribly flat and unemotional. The rest of the actors are not very talented. Although Forest Whitaker does relatively well for his part. *Music/Sound: The soundtrack is fine, although I personally found it to be uninteresting and did not add much to the film. The Academy Award was grossly undeserved. The sound design was quite awful. Lots of cheap sounds and much of the film felt empty in terms of audio. *Production Design/Special Effects: Again, terrible decision by the Academy to award this film. The sets, costumes, and practical effects are not bad by any means, but they feel incredibly ordinary. They are not very dynamic or original. Many of the sets (especially CGI sets) felt incredibly bland and uninteresting to look at. As far as CGI, this film looked terrible and there is no getting around it.<br/><br/>*Conclusion: ""Black Panther"" may be a decent film to pass the time if you want something to watch, but it is by no means life changing. It is one of the worst Marvel films and leaves much to be desired."

The CGI was pretty, the world crafted with it compelling and nice, the characters all had depth and somewhat of an arc. It took care to be generally enjoyable for everyone no matter which characters you found most interesting and nice.
This would easily have been a 9/10 despite the somewhat corporate overpolished aspect of things.<br/><br/>However there were some glaring problems:
-Without spoiling anything the climactic fight scene is .... very lackluster, as others have pointed out. Fields and a cheaply rendered underground place? Did the CGI budget run out?
-Connected to this and all major fight scenes, while some african style music was included in other places, the fight scenes sorely acked them. Some unique music in those places could have enhanced this whole thing massively, but instead we just got the same old orchestral stuff, instead of some wakandan music enhanced.
-On the other side of things the whole white man as ""colonizers"" thing has been pushed a bit too much and it's incredibly cringe-y.
-Furthermore like with all avengers movies the good guys kill too many people. Additionally in this one they are defending a government style which - while admittedly it has worked for them - is really really nonsensical.<br/><br/>So all in all a nigh perfect movie hampered by blunders that are too big to ignore."

Also his dope soundtrack raised hairs on my neck (the metaphorical ones because I don't have any).<br/><br/>The colors and the African city in the movie was great!

"jjsledge-95899","7","0","2","6 April 2019"," Sorry, but not the best Marvel movie ever.....
","Does it have the aspects of all great Marvel movies? Yes. It has the stunning visuals, amazing CGI, near-perfect soundtrack, and a well put together cast.<br/><br/>Is it the best Marvel movie ever? No. It took 18 movies for Marvel to set up the MCU to get to a point to actually make this. If they had tried to make it in Phase 2 or 3 of the Infinity Saga (aka after The Avengers or Avengers: Age of Ultron), it may not have been the success it was. Black Panther, although a key Avengers member, is not necessarily the most well known comic character.<br/><br/>Like the rest, it does have flaws. Some of which are major. Killmonger is a little too over-zealous to make him supportable. Some characters aren't developed enough, even though they do show up in Infinity War later on. And the flashback scenes don't explain enough.<br/><br/>It probably got a little over-hyped because it was the first minority superhero blockbuster (although Wesley Snipes' Blade trilogy was the first minority Marvel hero film). Marvel is working on a more diverse, inclusive film slate, which will bring about a new era. And may get those who aren't ""nerds"" into the theaters."

","I want to start this by saying that ""Black Panther"" is a very important film in terms of representation. This is also one of the only movies I have ever seen that introduces the audience to a new culture that feels like I could actually described afterwards. The soundtrack is amazing and really helps the transitions feel smooth and adds to the action sequences.<br/><br/>However this movie has a pacing issue that results in it feeling like two films that were pushed together. The second half of this movie is definitely better than the first for the simple reason that Michael B. Jordan gets to shine as killmonger, one of the best villains that the series has had so far. The casting in this movie is brilliant with the interactions between Boseman and Jordan towards the end being what is most memorable about the experience. The pacing issues cannot be overlooked however and the fight scenes were a little disappointing given Coogler's previous work on ""Creed"" A very enjoyable film overall and a welcome addition to the MCU."

","Notwithstanding the genre, which I enjoy generally, this story just never really grabbed me. In fact, it took a few sittings to watch to completion. The hook does come, but too late in my view.<br/><br/>I thought some direction was overdone, in the sense that the director wants the audience to feel something, and is perhaps not sure it's been accomplished, so does a closeup on a character demonstrating that feeling. (Eg., I don't need a long close-up of someone saying ""weeee"" to know I should feel exhilarated, and it's off-putting.)<br/><br/>Generally, the acting was good, but I must admit that I did not care for Andy Serkis in the villain role, which I thought was overacted, although I usually like him (particularly in the little gem, Einstein and Eddington). Again, a direction issue, not an actor issue.<br/><br/>Overall, I just don't think the story itself was sufficiently well-told and directed to merit a higher rating. In my view, it was a real gift and way-off to be nominated for best movie. In my view, this movie is not even in the same story-telling ballpark as, eg, the wonderfully told story, Green Book."

","Black panther was an very good movie worth the watch"
"sspc-68699","7","0","2","15 March 2019"," Overrated But Still Fun!!
","The MCU has made some films I would describe as truly fantastic, such as Thor: Ragnarok, Doctor Strange, and Iron Man 3. Black Panther by contrast was an fun movie, not a masterful piece or arts, but a mostly fun movie. Killmonger is one of the superior villains in the MCU because of the well fleshed out nature of his characters, properly established motivations, and a kick ass and sympathetic performance from Michael B Jordan. The protagonist however is simply a dull character who you simply aren't invested in, simply because of the high benchmark set forth by the MCU pertaining to protagonists.
The movie does NOT have a deep message, infact like Captain America: Civil War It masquerades itself as a deep movie by creating a moral dilemma, and then executing it in the most generic and unintriguing way possible. If you come to find enjoyment in Black panther through substance you will be disappointed. If you come for fun action sequences, some nicely done drama, and an enjoyable cinematic experience, Black Panther certainly delivers. The movie uses the facade of culture to pretend like it's not part of Kevin Feiges manufacturing line of same old variations of cinema, but ultimately the shoot em up third act pretty much exposes the fact that black panther is another fun, somewhat funny, display of popcorn entertainment from marvel."

","T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), King of Wakanda, faces the difficulties and hard decisions of ruling a thriving, but secret country. He must keep the treasures of Wakanda out of the wrong hands, while also fighting a possible challenger for his crown. He has the special abilities of the Black Panther, which gives him extra speed and strength. In addition to all of these challenges that he faces in his country, he is also tasked with deciding whether and how his country should help the other struggling Africans around the world.<br/><br/>We are hardly started in ""Black Panther"", and we can already see that this movie stands aside from routine superhero movies. It stands aside from the movies that are churned out every year that focus on the intense action scenes that completely overshadow the entire plot, if there is one. Like DC's ""Man of Steel"", it is the real thing. Boseman insists on T'Challa's good heart, courage and determination, and on the challenges many people face around the world today.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a detailed flashback describing the history of Wakanda. It then comes back to the present and introduces us to the main characters: T'Challa, the future king of Wakanda, Shuri, T'Challa's sister, and Nakia, T'Challa's ex-girlfriend. T'Challa is getting ready to be crowned king, and we see another flashback which ties in to a previous movie, ""Captain America: Civil War"". As this is happening, we are introduced to the villain, a young American man, and his partner. We then see the story of how T'Challa saves Wakanda, and in doing so, saves the world.<br/><br/>Unlike most other similar movies, ""Black Panther"", gives vivid descriptions of all the characters, providing backstories that explain their actions and make viewers feel sympathetic towards both the hero and the villain. We see how the villain, Erik Killmonger, grew up, and the specific events that made him who he is now. In many other movies, the villain is a huge machine who goes around killing people just to cause chaos, but in this movie, Killmonger is human and does what he thinks is right.<br/><br/>The same can be said for T'Challa. We see how he struggles to decide between what is morally right and what will help his people. He leads with his heart and relies on the advice his father gave him before he died. He is not perfect and makes many mistakes, but because of his determination, he makes things work out. He shows that he is a leader that his people can believe in.<br/><br/>Also, unlike most other movies, ""Black Panther"" connects the events and problems of this fictional world to the problems of the world we live in today. As The New York Times describes, ""In its emphasis on black imagination, creation, and liberation, the movie becomes an emblem of the past that was denied and a future that feels very present."" It is clear that the main problem in the film is not an evil villain looking to destroy the world, but a struggle to fix a world where no one is equal. At the core, it is a movie debating the best way to fix the discrimination that so many people face today, infused with action packed scenes, humor, and drama. On one hand, we have a man who has seen the struggles of the world firsthand, and on the other, we have a king who is desperately trying to learn but cannot possibly understand what everyone is going through. As the movie progresses, opinions change, and even though the solution presented is unrealistic and impossible in our world, it is still understood that we need to find some kind of a solution.<br/><br/>""Black Panther"" is a movie unlike any other in its genre, with superior storytelling and a realistic plot, that changes how we think of superhero movies. I would recommend this for anyone who likes Marvel or DC movies, such as ""Wonder Woman"" or ""Spider-man"", and is looking for a new movie to satisfy their action packed tastes. I would also recommend this to anyone who likes movies focusing on real world problems and is looking for something similar, but different. ""Black Panther"" is a movie that anyone can enjoy, from kids to adults, no matter what they like."

","The first thing that struck me about Black Panther was visual imagery. From a simple detail like a milk cart for a net on a street basketball court to the way the spectators were placed for the ritual over the waterfall to the pastures and futuristic urban landscape of Wakanda. Then came the questions. Like, if your country is in possession of something valuable that allowed you to make extraordinary progress and give your citizens good lives, do you keep it to yourself or do you help others at a risk of losing it all? The movie answers this in a rather naive, simplistic manner. Well, it kind of had to, being a superhero movie. Just as it had to have all those silly fights and rhino robots. But it also had a villain whose goal is actually quite noble, making things beautifully complicated. And that, along with the actual beauty of which there was so much, made it well worth watching."

","Now, before I start this review, the one person writing all these 1 star reviews on different accounts need to stop.<br/><br/>
Let me just start by saying that this movie is everything you would want from a Marvel Movie. From the plot to the characters and their stories, this is the perfect Marvel movie. Sue me. I don't care. It's amazing.<br/><br/>The start of the movie is a flashback to when N'Jobu was alive and planning a heist os some sorts, until he feels the need to hide the guns. Then, members of the Dora Milan's, a army of women from Wakanda knock at his door, while his friend, who is actually Zuri. They open the door, and the lights turn on and off, and then, king T'Chaka is there. Him and N'Jobu, his actual name, are brothers. N'Jobu figures out that Zuri, who N'Jobu doesn't know is also a spy, is from Wakanda. Let me flash forward cuz your probably getting bored.<br/><br/>There are a few lines from Erik Killmonger, or N'Jadaka that makes me think about my ancestors, who are black. Near the end, Killmonger says this: ""Bury me in the oceans, like my ancestors who jumped from the ships, cause' they knew, that death... was better than bondage."" That got me thinking that one of my ancestors managed to survive slavery and NOT jump from the ships that is just amazing to me. Another line that still is important to me at least is when Killmonger said this: ""Weeks? I don't need weeks. The whole country don't gotta be there, I just need him, and someone to get me out I these chains."" The chains part got me thinking about slavery.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is amazing because of the African cast, it's racial references, and it's amazing writing. It's not what you would expect from a Marvel movie, which is a very, very good thing to see."

","Why would any American audience care about any 'royal linage' form of government? Did we not fight and win two wars to throw off any hints of foreign royal influence? Can Americans relate to the top leader of a country being determined by single combat to the death?<br/><br/>At nearly ever turn there is anti European ancestry statements and references. Anti-White stereotypes and outright racism are prevalent. There are so many references to violence against non-Blacks and current world governments, a person would think the title 'Black Panther' refers to the 'American Black Panther Party'.<br/><br/>Lastly, the CGI is clumsy at best."
"wfh-28059","9","0","4","20 February 2019"," Commentary on the Contemporary World
","Today in the United States and around the world minorities are often oppressed by governments and feel abandoned by groups that could've helped them overcome it. In the 2018 Academy Award nominated movie Black Panther this issue is one of several discussed in the plot. The movie follows the story of Wakanda, a fictional utopia for Africans on their native continent. While war wages on the outside all is at peace in Wakanda. The king of Wakanda is T'Challa who loves his people and wants them to prosper; he is given the powers of the Black Panther, a mythical superhero that allow him coupled with technology, to be literally unbeatable. The story of the movie weaves through the different settings and time periods to show the difference between Wakanda and the outside world, while they are prospering the world is struggling.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie music plays a huge role in terms of conveying the meaning behind it. The tempo rhythm and beat all help to set the mood of the scene. Whenever the king T'Chaka or his side are involved traditional African drumming is prevalent to contrast when Killmonger or the antagonist side is involved more contemporary rap music takes over. This contrast helps to convey the contrast between the two sides and what they stand for, thus adding an aspect of social commentary on the debate of the non-violent traditionalists and violent realists. T'Chaka wants to keep Wakanda separate, to preserve the Utopia of the previous generations. Killibonger on the other hand wants to use the edge in technology and peace Wakanda has to overthrow the world and create an empire where ""the sun never sets."" Music also is present in combat in the form of high tempo to add intensity to the scene.<br/><br/>Cinematography also plays a huge role in the movie too and helps to provide social commentary throughout it. A good example is when the mentioning of sunsets come up and there is a scene of Killbonger and T'Chaka where music accompanies the beautiful images and lighting. In Oakland where the movie starts lighting is dim and dark to show the state of current people of African descent. Meanwhile in the technology lab in Wakanda, the lighting is bright and futuristic showing how advanced they are. This helps to provide a commentary of the contrast between Wakanda and the outside world because with these examples the viewer can see how it relates to reality and visual aspects of the movie.<br/><br/>Acting also plays a huge role in how the social commentary between the contrasting sides is portrayed. The casting of Chadwick Boseman in the lead role of T'Challa is perfect as he carries the role with ease of showing a caring king for his people. On a contrasting note, Michael B. Jordan plays an amazing Killmonger someone who is fed up with the world and the oppression it presents; how he is in it solely for the benefit of himself and no one else. Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, and Forest Whitaker play well casted supporting roles to help surround these leads with people who have similar viewpoints and wishes for Wakanda and the world. Throughout the movie, these characters add a dimension behind the two leads as they fight for power and the future.<br/><br/>I recommend Black Panther because above all it helps to portray and tell a well structured story of how minorities struggle every single day in the world to gain recognition and equal treatment. This movie provides the social commentary of being open to help those around oneself peacefully without conflict and to build through friendship, not aggression. This especially plays out in the end, but I do not want to spoil it, so go watch Black Panther. It is available on most streaming platforms such as Netflix and on iTunes and Google Play."

CGI is very obvious, but usually well executed and of high studio-quality.<br/><br/>Cross-movie character interactions are well done and interesting as usual. I had strong hopes throughout the movie, waiting for it to depict how Wakanda fits into the rest of the world, only for it (after half-finished attempts) to ultimately give up on trying to chase this potentially interesting idea, and instead fall back to a very generic, overused, and predictable ending. For me, this part would've been the most interesting, and coupled with the environment design, these half-finished attempts basically account for all the good in this movie.<br/><br/>The movie, in general, is enjoyable but also vastly overrated by critics, most likely due to completely unneeded political motivations. It's a good watch, but nothing remarkable or memorable. It's nothing more than one of the already seen, weaker fillers in the MCU."

","T'Challa (also known as the Black Panther) returns to his homeland after the lose of his father (as we saw in Captain America - Civil War). T'Challa accepts the crown and becomes king of Wakanda, but his position is soon challenged by a new threat.<br/><br/>Unlike the previous Marvel instalments, our lead hero is more of a silent type who rarely speaks, but when he does, he's confident and strong. The film also has a heavier focus on story and developing its new characters rather than loading the film up with huge amounts of witty jokes as we've previously in the likes of Thor Ragnarok or Iron Man. The film also has less amount of action than I expected for a Marvel title. But is less humour and action something to be spoken about as a negative or positive?<br/><br/>Being a Marvel film, one element that doesn't surprise me is that once again we have an audio track which is loud and alive. I personally love how Black Panther's soundtrack felt- perfectly timed and fitting tightly with every moment. Even the faint drumming in the background of some scenes was tension building and gave life to moments where key characters dealt with dramatic situations. The visuals are also strong, full of colour, except for some of the film's fights scenes, and this brings me to one of the film's negatives for me personally.<br/><br/>Some the fights scenes are fast and quick, which I expected for someone who moves and fights like a Panther. But, some of these action scenes were nearly in utter darkness and I found it slightly disappointing. Some of the action scenes were so dark it became somewhat unreal, almost turning it into an animation film and it became harder to enjoy the action as the darkness felt slight distracting. Other action sequence resulted in predictable outcomes even before the claws come out. The villains (yes, plural) overall were also fun and some of the best we've seen in the Marvel universe to date (Andy Serkis- dare I say no more lol).<br/><br/>Overall, this is yet again another enjoyable Marvel film. I love how this film manages to be different from the other previous instalments. We have a new entry to the Marvel universe which focuses more on creating better characters and a strong plot rather than pushing witty characters and big bang action sequences. I truly give absolute respect to the results that have been achieved here. While it might not be my no.1 Marvel film to date, I can easily understand why many Marvel fans will sing and chant its praises.<br/><br/>8.1/10

"Chancery_Stone","7","0","6","9 January 2019"," A genuine surprise
","I very nearly didn't watch this, because it had been so hyped for being the first all-black super-hero movie. I simply assumed it was being given high ratings by the black audience just out of loyalty, but I was wrong. It was refreshingly good, and very unusual. For a change it had some story and characters you could feel some sympathy with and, for a wonder, fight sequences that weren't just there to make fodder for the spin off video games. Ironically, I found it a bit racist, with its overly 'happy peasants in their wonderful country' vibe. Why should an African culture evolve to still keep peasant farmers and straw huts when every other culture that gets technological advances leaves that behind? Also, just taking spears and other primitive weapons and making them advanced also smacked of racism (they'd be far more likely to just adopt and advance guns) but these little quibbles aside I enjoyed it. I even teared up when the villain died - that NEVER happens in super-hero movies simply because the villain never really has complexity or anything to sympathise with. Great turn from Andy Serkis too and all the leads did their job well. Overall, it held my interest and I enjoyed it, and I don't often say that about a Marvel movie."

The ps2 cgi fight at the end didn't help either.<br/><br/>I don't know why marvel constantly takes the same character and costume for the hero and copy paste it on the villain and make him evil. Lack of ideas? Color grading has been forever awful since I watched that marvel review on YouTube and can say it was a real disappointment. Even if there's alot of fiction and cgi, there are a lot of beautiful and colorful places in Africa for great photography to be used in the film. Grey and brown mush is what you can expect. In general, all the actors do a good job. I don't really know who to blame for this overrated film. The studio or the audience with their political agenda. I always want to like a film.

","Another strong, entertaining addition to the ever-expanding Marvel Universe, ""Black Panther"" gets going from the first few scenes and doesn't ever let up. In fact, by the time the movie is over it's hard to believe it's been over two hours, as it feels like it goes by in a flash. The African-influenced set dressing and costume design are beguiling while the cast fills the screen with confidence, with stand-out performances by Michael B. Jordan, Danai Gurira and Winston Duke amidst an on-screen parade of charisma. The African accents stand out by virtue of their scarcity within big-budget blockbuster American entertainment, and the movie's deliberately casual embrace of its characters' roots make the finished product all the more remarkable."

","I suppose it's a fine film for the average movie-goer. It's got some terrific action; that trademark Marvel superhero comedy spice; and a surprisingly relatable and charismatic villain. 'Black Panther' fell short in other areas though - the acting in general was strange: rarely bad, but often stiff, forced, or very unconvincing, which became even more obvious when the dialogue was at its weakest. It would have served the movie better if the characters spoke in their native language, as it would have removed some of the stilted vibes from the dialogue. Beyond that, the CGI was generally hit-or-miss; Wakanda was disappointing from both a visual and logical standpoint, and many of the jokes were cringe-inducing. Michael B. Jordan deserves a special mention though for his amazingly magnetic performance as Killmonger."

","In the present day, an ancient civilization who discovered the most advanced material and used it to become highly advanced, stays hidden from the world together with its tech. After the death of his father, T'Challa is to be named king but soon he'll find out that a well-hidden secret from the past will force its way into the present to make his job much harder than imagined.<br/><br/>It's one of those movies which has a great idea, that of an advanced civilization living hidden in the present world, and builds its story based on it. Speaking of the story, it's quite good from most points of view, managing to avoid linearity and bring something out of the obvious every now and then. It has its flaws though, I must admit, especially when it comes to the finale which could have been treated better, but it is good enough to keep the action together. The characters portrayed are well thought, a bit underdeveloped unfortunately, but still likeable and worthy of the story.<br/><br/>The movie is based on action, so you can expect plenty of it, regardless of time. It is by far the most important part of the film, all the amazing fighting scenes, whether speaking of 1v1 or large scale, contribute decisively to the outcome of the film, especially entertaining-wise. You also get a bit of drama from time to time and some emotion, but the action remains dominant.<br/><br/>To help build this amazing world, the producers used a couple of very impressive visual effects. It's easy to see that they've put quite a lot of effort into this department, making sure that everything looks as good as it can be. You simply have to give them credit for this one. Another aspect which is worth mentioning is the soundtrack, very well made according to the atmosphere of the movie, adding more suspense each time it comes into play.<br/><br/>Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It had a good story, good characters, great atmosphere with great music and some amazing special effects. If the story had received a bit more polish and the characters would have been a bit more complex, we would have been talking about a truly great film. Not that it isn't great as it is, but you're left with the feeling that it could have been made a bit better."

","The story is the Lost Heir Who Comes to Claim His Kingdom, one of the most used plots in all genres. Here it's a well done fantasy-scifi, with better than average writing for the genre, and only mildly overdone fight scenes. For once, the CGI is justified by the story, which would be impossible to present convincingly without it. The movie uses all the tropes and clichés we've come to expect from the Marvel comic book universe, and takes them seriously but not solemnly. Striking visuals, beautiful design, pretty good acting, and generally unintrusive music help to make this an entertaining movie. ***"
"Noah_Biondi","9","0","5","21 October 2018"," Wakanda forever!
","Black Panther, the highest grossing Marvel movie at the domestic box office, has received so much love and praise from critics and audiences all around the world. Is it worth all the praise? Yes, yes it is! This is an absolutely fun popcorn film with tons and tons of depth.<br/><br/>What's the story? After the death of his father, T'Challa returns home to the African nation of Wakanda to take his rightful place as king. When a powerful enemy suddenly reappears, T'Challa's mettle as king -- and as Black Panther -- gets tested when he's drawn into a conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at risk. Faced with treachery and danger, the young king must rally his allies and release the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people.<br/><br/>Okay, let's acknowledge the elephant in the room first, since I just wanna get it over with: the CGI isn't the best. Although Wakanda looks absolutely beautiful, the opening scene had very well-crafted CGI, and the action is really exciting, there are times where the CGI could look absolutely STUPID, like during the scene where T'Challa and Killmonger were fighting. The people standing up on the mountain was done in such a horrible way it's laughable at how fake it is. Also, near the end where T'Challa and Killmonger were once again fighting but this time with some electric trains, that also looked very laughable and stupid. Okay, with that aside, the best aspect of the film is the story. Not the action, DEFINITELY not the effects, but the story. It's a movie that is aware of other countries, which is a great twist, not just for Marvel, but for movies in general. I know Marvel likes to put their primary focus on the story, which is a smooth move, but in this film it especially works because we need to see the nation of Wakanda and to sympathize what it's going through. It's also kind of like James Bond where they go to different countries, like Nigeria and South Korea. Also, although Wakanda isn't a real country, the movie develops and forms it to make it feel like it's real. They explain the nationality, the quality of life, the looks, and the culture of this fictional nation. It's very cool on how well-setup it is, and I wish more movies could do that. One last thing I'd like to mention is that the acting and characters are very well done, and while it does focus on a male superhero, it gives equal power to the female characters as well, and without them, the Black Panther is pretty much screwed.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Black Panther is a diverse and refreshing entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that's good for both Marvel fans and movie fans in general. Of course if you like Black Panther and Marvel, you'll love this film. Also, ignore the people who say it's a bad movie, because those people don't know what they're messing with."

"thehumanityy","4","0","1","8 October 2018"," Visually Stunning, Creativity with No Bounds, and a Formulaic and Predictable Plot
","I'm not even going to get into how this movie is really over-hyped. I finally watched this when all the popularity surrounding it had died down, so I'll just give my perspective on the substance. <br/><br/>The movie definitely had some of the best visuals and set pieces in almost any other Marvel movie, but the idea of Wakanda and the comics to begin with just gives a huge range of options and boundless area for creativity with this superhero and atmosphere. A secret civilization far more technologically advanced than any other first world country, basically the equivalent if Tony Stark owned his own small country. Warring tribes and factions of groups all vying for the thrown based on a unique political climate. Yet even with all these amazing ideas and the great filmography that made every shot look stunning, I couldn't help but feel it all came up short. <br/><br/>For instance, even the actors involved were an all-star lineup, but it seems like most of the characters they portrayed had bland dialogue and one dimensional personalities that had little depth to them. A major exception to this, however, was Killmonger who was a very good villain even though his ""master plan"" at the end was a little weird and vague. Andy Serkis was also entertaining beyond no ends as Klawe which is not surprising for him. <br/><br/>The plot was almost comically predictable as well where you could guess what was going to happen a mile away as if we had all already seen this exact same plot before, and some of the characters actions did not seen genuine and seemed to just happen to move the formulaic plot forwards where we all already knew it was headed. The fact that T'Challa just happened to appear with the mountain tribe is some coincidence. Martin Freeman's character also seemed ridiculously unnecessary and the idea of a CIA operative being a selfless hero is just absurd in my personal opinion, but hey, maybe the CIA are different in the Marvel Universe compared to real life.<br/><br/>Overall, it had more ups than downs and the visually appealing shots and filmography was enough alone to keep anyone entertained watching this movie. Now that it's on Netflix, there's absolutely no reason not to watch this and it gives a good precursor to how the Marvel phase 3 tech suits and weapons will look (Iron Man's nanotech suits).<br/><br/>Final score: 6.7/10 rounded to 7."

There are some really neat fight scenes around that part of the movie. Later and based on some historical revenge another challenger is granted his chance to fight for the throne.

","This movie is really not that great. I found it boring, action was mediocre, acting was good, similar story to many other movies (Lion King), and terrible CGi. Seriously, I don't know how a movie this expensive has such bad CGI? There is no weight or realism to the characters. They float like paper and when we have two CGI characters fighting, it looks about as good as a Playstation 3 cutscene. <br/><br/>This movie doesn't really have a plot until the final act of this movie when Kilmonger comes into frame. It is cool that it shows us African culture, that was nice. Some of the comedy was funny, and I like the actress who plays his sister, She was good. Once again, all the actresses and actors were good in this. It is just that this movie was boring, bland, and very long.<br/><br/>It doesn't add much to the Marvel cinema, and the action is really a huge letdown in this movie. The final battle makes no sense,like how a character just suddenly turns evil out of the blue. Michael Jordan is good in this movie, he has does say some of the deepest stuff in this movie.<br/><br/> He talks about the enslavement of Blacks and how other Blacks just seem to forget to help their own people and become greedy. That was deep man, and he ends the movie with another quote that hits you hard, something like ""Bury me in the ocean, with my ancestors that jumped off the ships, because they knew death was better than bondage."" He doesn't get much screen time so that kinda sucks, and his fight scene at the end with Black Panther was really bad. It reminded me of Spiderman when CGI characters fall while fighting. It looks really bad. His fight scene with the human Black Panther on the water fall was cool though.<br/><br/>6/10 <br/><br/>This isn't the best Marvel movie like some people claim it is. THe best Marvel movie is still The Winter Soldier. <br/><br/>The worst Marvel movies so far are Iron Man 2, Iron Man 3, & Dr.Strange."

","Just finished seeing The Black Panther at the theater. I must say I am very impressed. Marvel really crafted an interesting world in Black Panther full of fascinating characters.<br/><br/>The best aspect of the film is easily the world building. Black Panther crafted the Wakanda world with such detail it was breath taking. The movie really went above and beyond shaping a unique and engaging culture for their world scape. <br/><br/>Acting wise the movie was packed to the brim with talent. There really wasn't a bad performance in the movie. I particularly enjoyed Danai Gurira who was bad ass as always. <br/><br/>The acting was only enhanced by the fact the characters were all well written. Both Killmonger and Klaw were interesting and engaging villains in their own way. Killmonger in particular was a standout in the Marvel Universe for an interesting villain. It was also great to see Andy Serkis in person for a change.<br/><br/> Animation wise the movie was gorgeous. There was a lot of pure eye candy in this film. On top of that the choreography for the fight scenes was outstanding. The final large all out battle was particularly satisfying. who doesn't love seeing someone riding rhino into battle?<br/><br/>Whoever made the soundtrack also did a great job. Sound was a big part of this movie and directly tied into a lot of scenes. The music really helped to immerse you into the Black Panther World.<br/><br/>I did feel the movie was a bit uneven though. The movie had a very strong opening and ending, but the middle was a bit weak. You could easily predict what was going to happen mid-way through the movie. That didn't take away from the enjoyment of the movie, but I would have preferred to see a tighter script.<br/><br/>Overall this is one of the most original and interesting Marvel movies to date. Despite its minor flaws it was a great ride from start to finish. A 8.25 out of 10."

The wide range of characters each have their own appeal and show a much more human side to the proceedings, but none really stood out and the villains were disappointing in their simplistic desires. The special effects and fight scenes are great, being fast paced, energetic and not overly destructive, but as with most Marvel movies, the hero is too indestructible and as a consequence, any threat to him never seems real."

","After so many deeply interconnected chapters, it's relieving to see a film in the MCU that doesn't require much previous knowledge to enjoy. Referencing the preceding (and forthcoming) films in Marvel's repertoire only fleetingly, Black Panther is a largely self-contained, by-the-numbers superhero flick. Which works both for it and against it. In one respect, that enables the entire cast to establish themselves. Safe from the need to constantly pay homage to Tony Stark or Thanos, Panther's supporting players thrive and King T'Challa himself goes through a complete character arc. On the other hand, it often feels like we've been here before. Maybe not specifically, as the film goes to great lengths to set up Wakanda as a unique culture with authentic customs, but certainly thematically.<br/><br/>As a ""back to basics"" approach with well-timed, socially conscious values, it functions very well. Its flavor is like nothing else we've seen from Marvel so far - a bright, optimistic blend of tech and nature that really works - and the wide diversity of the on-screen population is both effective and appropriate.<br/><br/>A complete, enjoyable new entry in the publisher's stacked catalog of characters, and a short breath of fresh air, if not a complete breakthrough."

"Eclectic-Boogaloo","7","0","1","20 September 2018"," A serviceable movie elevated by a magnetic supporting turn by Michael B. Jordan
","And despite Michael B. Jordan's fantastic performance, which brought to mind Yul Brenner's turn as Ramses II in 'The Ten Commandments,' in terms of on-screen presence and charisma, I'm going to go against the tide and say that Eric Killmonger was not a great villain... and moreover, what was lacking in the characterization of Killmonger is what kept Black Panther from being a great film. But I'll start with the positive:<br/><br/>There was a lot to like about Black Panther. It's a splendid sci-fi/fantasy vision of Africa. The world and its people (their costumes, makeup) where wonderfully realized. I also enjoyed the performances, basically across the board. Everyone was great in it. The film was pretty well shot and directed too, with the exception of a few key sequences (that I'll point out further down). Overall, Black Panther is a great looking movie, with terrific sound and atmosphere.<br/><br/>Now the bad. I was really intrigued by the philosophical divide separating Killmonger and Black Panther hinted at by the movie. The idea that the nation of Wakanda should be an active participant in improving the lot of Africa and the African Diaspora is, in and of itself, a noble cause that has been debated amongst black leaders throughout history... as has whether doing it by working with the 'western world,' white men, or by bringing them down. It's been bone of contention between the likes of MLK and Malcolm X and many others.But where black 'radical' leaders looked to organize a resistance by rallying their people behind ideas, and empowerment first, violence afterwards, Killmonger by comparison had no philosophy, moral, or guiding principal. The moment he took power he revealed himself to be nothing but a common thug with a personal vendetta which, in my opinion, did a disservice to the supposed conflict at the heart of the film.<br/><br/>The moral of the story could've been so much more than, 'don't leave the son of someone you kill alive, because they're going to come back to get you.' It could've been something much deeper and thought provoking.<br/><br/>Asides from my issues with the writing as it pertained to Killmonger, my only other issue with the movie was the third act final fight sequence between Black Panther and Killmonger. It was darkly shot and frenetic. It wasn't just that it was hard to follow, it was also a downright unattractive final fight unworthy of such an otherwise good looking movie.<br/><br/>But on the whole, I liked Black Panther. It was pretty well crafted and the novelty of the world, its cast, made for a fresh cinematic experience."
"miked85","8","0","1","17 September 2018"," I don't know what all the hate is for?

The parts in Wakanda are ""boring"" and ""don't have any action,"" because it's a peaceful country. The fact that all the action is in other countries for the first 3/4 of the film is intentional. It makes it more dramatic to see violence brought to Wakanda.<br/><br/>I will say they could have established Wakanda's isolationist stance better by providing more arguments that the outside world is destructive. I would have also liked to see more action from Kill Monger early on to establish him as a better fighter."

","Black Panther is just one of the latest in what has been an impressive string of movies in the Marvel cinematic universe. Even with all of the hype leading up, I did not expect this movie to be nearly as good as other superhero movies that had come out prior such as Thor: Ragnarok, Spider-Man: Homecoming, or Captain America: Civil War. I was dead wrong. Chadwick boseman could not have been a better choice to play the film's main character T'Challa and that goes for the rest of the star-studded cast. Across the board the acting is excellent and it is all driven by a plot that is so good it has you even feeling sympathy for the antagonist in the plot Killmonger. Black panther is the first mainstream movie to ever feature a black protagonist superhero as well as feature a predominantly African American cast. At the start of the film we are given some context as to who these Wakandans are and where they come from including a saying so catchy it had myself yelling it out of the theatre for days ( WAKANDA FOREVA!!!!) The music even sets the mood of whatever the current scene is perfectly to the point where you are totally invested in everything panther. Boseman is both charismatic and resilient in every way in this film and shows incredible mental strength even more than physical. Not to mention the suit is by far the coolest ever made! As I watched this, I could not believe just how blown away I truly was. I came in knowing nothing about this place wakanda and it's universe and characters and came out wishing I was young enough to be them all for Halloween this year. Michael B. Jordan is so good that when he overthrows T'Challa I was actually mad in the theatre. Everything about this movie screams greatness and a classic. Although the film did not have quite as much humor as Thor did, the story was so much emotionally deeper and complete. In reviews I like to at least attempt to point out something I feel could have been done differently, or better, but with Black Panther I truly cannot. It was that good. There will be sequels simply because it is a marvel movie, but if there never was this would go down as an all time classic not only for its quality but also the importance it serves to the African American kids who never have seen a superhero their same skin color. This movie hits on all notes and levels and blew me away and continues to every time I watch it. I've watched it 6 times. Good job Marvel."

"rolandjordaan2","8","0","1","14 September 2018"," Black Panther - Spoiler Free Review
","Marvel seldom puts out bad films and as far as stand-alone features go, this is probably one of the best they have put out in a while. The film does a marvellous job bringing to life the fictional world of Wakandla, having put thought into every little detail and fans of the 'Black Panther' series of comics (which I am) will be thrilled; in ways of set work and art direction, I'll say this is Marvel's golden achievement. Casting is great as well with Chadwick Boseman returning to the screen as the titular 'Black Panther' or King T'Challa, after first being introduced in 2016's 'Captain America: Civil War', Chadwick was born to play this part, bringing heart to his character, facing a constant inner battle between his loyalties to his kingdom and his moral obligations to an outside world less fortunate. Side characters do a great job too, especially Letitia Wright as T'Challa's younger sister, Shuri. The sibling chemistry between these two characters are off the chart and is an actual true highlight of this film, you completely buy them as brother and sister, constantly on each other's cases, but: should anyone else dare... Both the main antagonists in this film do a great job as well, and that was quite refreshing too, as one place Marvel often has fallen short was in creating memorable villains. Michael B. Jordan stars as Erik Killmonger and Andy Serkis (for once not just appearing as a CGI character) as Ulysses Klaue; Jordan plays his character more straight, assassin like, but sells it well, creating sympathy and even some understanding for what we know is a truly evil character, Serkis takes a more comedic approach, basically playing the character as a fat South African who had one too many beers; both characters are completely different and sets two different tones for the film that actually makes the pacing work brilliantly as we switch over from the second to third act. Lastly I just want to make mention of the action as, after all, that is still why many people see these films: the action sequences in this film is great, but actually has it's best moments in the one-on-one battles when T'Challa has to defend his crown in tribal rituals. The fights are intense and beautifully choreographed. Really, there is nothing I can truly fault 'Black Panther' on; even somebody like me, who will openly admit that I have started finding the ever growing super hero genre to have become somewhat trying, will admit that this is about as fresh a film that has come from this genre since the original 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and it is most certainly a film I will happily recommend you go see on the big screen."

"mgruebel","6","0","1","14 September 2018"," Good wishful thinking
","Mythology is all about where you wish you had come from. This film certainly delivers on that wish. <br/><br/>I am not an automatic fan of Marvel Universe films, but this one was pretty good: not as lackluster and episodic as the first Guardians of the Galaxy (the 2nd was better), not as good as the original Ironman, from which it steals aplenty.<br/><br/>The greatest irony in this film is the idea that the achievements of Western-Asian technology, just upped a bit due to vibranium-better-than-steel, really should be what comes Out of Africa. Unfortunately the film forsakes the true beauty of Africa in favor of CGI skyscraper towns and dragonfly-styled aircraft. Except for one scene with ancestral panthers in a tree.<br/><br/>Still, as an action-driven superhero movie, it's pretty good. Some of the chase and war scenes are overly long. (The fight/car chase in the middle and final battle both start out promising, but just keep on giving and giving...) On the other hand there is reasonable character development, be it the villain cousin, the King, his warrior, priest, would be-wife, or sister. Poor Andy Serkis does not get much development though, so one can guess that he won't last all too long into this film. I know some people are not going to like the accents, but I've heard many native speakers from countries like Kenya or Zimbabwe, and the accent here is really a nice blend that evokes speakers of African languages speaking English. Probably a lot of US moviegoers have not heard many Africans, so this might seem a bit weird to them. <br/><br/>The film probably on the slow side for current superhero moviegoers, but for someone raised in the 70s, who thinks the original Star Wars is very fast-paced, it's just right. One thing the film does well, given the irony at its central core, is to walk the fine line between glorifying either technology or ghetto, and point to what all humans surely could do to make this a better world.<br/><br/>There are some plot holes, but even many of those serve the symbolism of the movie: Why leave the child behind in the ghetto without a father? Well, this is how it turns out for many young African-Americans, they don't go to Wakanda in reality. Others are just part of the comic book lore from which the film descends: such as how to keep an advanced civilization cloaked and completely unknown throughout history.<br/><br/>I was torn between 6 and 7, but looked at my ratings for a number of ""6"" and ""7"" films, and for now at least decided that it was closer to 6. But a strong 6."

"juliankennedy23","8","0","1","12 September 2018"," Come for the Panther but stay for the Serkis.
","Black Panther: 8 out of 10: Marvel Universes first African superhero (Chadwick Boseman) gets his first solo outing after an appearance in Captain America: Civil War (AKA the good Avenger's sequel) where he takes over his hidden African kingdom of Wakanda after the death of his father in a terrorist attack. As the king, he faces questions on whether to open his country to the wider world as well as threats from a usurper (Killmonger played by Michael B. Jordan) who threatens to take the throne. <br/><br/>The Good. There are some great performances in Black Panther. Angela Bassett brings gratis as the Queen mother (And does not look either her own nor the character's age); Winston Duke shines as M'Baku the leader of the Jabari tribe; Letitia Wright is funny and brilliant as the Black Panther's sister Shuri and seriously needs her own movie; and last but certainly not least is the best Marvel villain since Loki (and one that gives Heath Ledger's Joker a run for his money) Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue. <br/><br/>I cannot emphasize how much fun and joy the four actors above bring to the screen. Heck, I am recommending the film based on Wright's and Serkis' characters alone. They honestly save the movie.<br/><br/>Another thing that saves the movie is excellent costume design and a real sense that they took care to absorb real African cultures into their fictional world. This is an African utopia with a glorious sense of place. The music and costumes combine to help recreate a magical kingdom that still seems somewhat grounded.<br/><br/>The Bad: There is a moment in the film (or two) where there is an opportunity to have Winston Duke, as the leader of the Jabari tribe, usurp the crown and take the Black Panther mantle. The movie would have been wise to take this opportunity. Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther is dull and incompetent. Lady Jane Grey had a longer and more effective rule than this dope. Winston Duke has charisma and presence something one would hope for in a Marvel superhero. (As bad as the first two Thor movies could be they at least always got Thor right.)<br/><br/>The antagonist Killmonger isn't that much better. He is overshadowed by Andy Serkis' bad guy, he rants like Buggin Out from Do the Right Thing and he is as an Angry Black Man trope that mostly died out in the seventies. His main beef is that Wakanda didn't use its wealth and technology to help the African diaspora particularly as it refers to the Transatlantic slave trade. In other words, he is upset they didn't invade Mali in the 15th century. <br/><br/>Black Panther really missed an opportunity here. Wakanda is a Utopia. All Utopia's have a hidden dark side (See Dubai). Why not have a hidden underclass that Killmonger tries to save. The Mali Empire (1230 to 1670) is basically Wakanda in real life. I mean it is, after all, an absolute Monarchy with mines. It doesn't take a genius to write in an underclass for Killmonger to identify with. It would have also given the Black Panther character some depth and a reason to disagree with his traditionalist mother.<br/><br/>The Ugly: Someone at Disney shorted these poor folks on their FX budget. It is clear that they got the B-team. You would think with all the money Disney was saving remaking both the Lion King and a superhero movie in the same film they could have spared a few bucks.<br/><br/>In Conclusion: Remember how underwhelming the third act was in the Original Iron Man. Remember how we ignored that because the film was so good. Black Panther is the now the eighteenth Marvel movie yet are we still treated to the same lame showdown and battle in a field. <br/><br/>While it is no Blade, Black Panther is a treat of music and costumes and some breakout performances. Come for the Panther but stay for the Serkis."

","After weeks of reviews both praising and belittling BP, I figured I'd watch it myself and make my own judgment. I have to say that I am completely in the middle about the movie.<br/><br/>For a Marvel movie, I was a bit let down - there were far too many incongruities to make me love it, but some of the acting was outstanding, specifically Michael B. Jackson and Martin Freeman (Andy Serkis was damn convincing as well.) The rest of the actors were pretty flat and predictable. They did a GREAT job with the CGI, though.<br/><br/>One of my biggest complaints with BP was the idea that an independent nation that had its own language spoke both in english and wakandan and slipped back and forth in their own country. If the characters are going to speak english, speak english. If they're going to speak wakandan complete with subtitles, make us read. Really annoyed the hell out of me.<br/><br/>Its worth a watch, and I'm glad I did - once. Won't be watching again unless there's nothing on but soccer."

","I'll start with the pluses, because they are few. The picture is incredibly beautiful (who would doubt, because the budget for the film is huge) and I'm not talking about the graphic component (it is performed at medium-high level), but about landscapes, suits and so on. That's all pluses. In the negative, I will not go into details. The protagonist is the personification of despondency. The main villain, though well played by Michael Bi Jordan, is a complete copy of the black panther in strength, differing only in color. By the way, the main villain and protagonist are invulnerable in their costumes. Empathizing for someone in this regard is very difficult. Further on the list is the fact that this film is a filler. that is, all the events of this film have no significance for the entire movie world. I could name even more minuses of this film, but I doubt that anyone will ever read my review. On this all, all love!"

","Black Panther was a joy to watch, from it's ability to keep you invested throughout the entirety of the film, to it's set of amazing cast members, great use of the soundtrack, memorable characters, and it's overwhelmingly relatable antagonist. I can't lie, Killmonger made this movie for me from beginning to end. I loved everything about his character, his ambitions, everything he did to achieve what he wanted, it makes you question if he was truly the villain, no? Truly one can feel empathy with such a great antagonist. The CGI wasn't that great honestly, it was either averagely passable or poor. As well as I noticed that for every confirmed kill there wasn't a single drop of blood spilled from the character, and if there was there wasn't as much as it's supposed to, noticeably one kill that Killmonger does where he slices the neck of a character and nothing comes out of her neck, it kept disturbing me. But apart from these two things, Black Panther is a must-watch this year and totally recommendable!"

","People are generally too hard on this movie (or too excited about it). 
It's obviously adapted to a somewhat younger audience (so you can bring your 11-year old). Violence, yes, but not too much detail, almost no blood at all, and no sex. 
The weakness of it is that in its attempt to be empowering (and it really tries to be that) it gets too self-aware and looses tempo. It's a bit like a slightly uneven The Two Towers, set in Africa. 
I found it slow and a bit tame in the beginning, much like a Hallmark production, but halfway it picked up speed and I was drawn into the story. 
 Much of the best acting comes from the female actors, especially Danai Gurira, though I do think they could have developed some of the characters more. Michael B Jordan is hypnotizing as a tormented super villain (and not just because of his looks). But can anyone tell me what in the world Bilbo was doing there!? You're not fooling anyone with that accent btw. Can someone show him back to the Shire, please! (Though the idea to let an outsider experience Wakanda from the inside is appealing.)<br/><br/>Hoping for a sequel!"

","Wow wow wow ! What I am really seeing on the first few pages of the review thread of this film. So many negative reviews and most of them coming from a viewpoint that the film has been overrated by critics. Seriously ! when you buy a ticket, you never really ask a critic for consideration. Sometimes you enjoy even the worst movie in theater. Judging on the basis of Critics's opinions seems dumb and totally childish. Anyways this is my opinion. I recently watched the film and to be really frank, had not really bothered about the reviews. I would have watched anyway even if they were negative.<br/><br/>Like all Marvel Superhero films, Black Panther follows the traditional route of Good Vs Evil but with style and substance. It's not a flawless film. The pace dips many times in between and the editing could have been crisper. The CGI also looks unimpressive at many places. But this film truly belongs to its actors. Each and everyone of them is an absolute marvel on Screen.<br/><br/>However, the two actors although very good and performed extremely well didn't leave a lasting Impression I was expecting throughout. Chadwik Boseman (Black Panther) and Letitia Wright (Shuri). The latter's performance has been applauded like crazy and I found her overrated. Don't even understand how she's given more Importance that Okoye and Nokia who were far better etched characters than her. <br/><br/>Anyways Micheal Jordan is simply superb as KillMonger. Hope he now has understood that he suits the image of a larger than life supervillian than playing a dumb Johnny Storm in fantastic four series. I also felt they could have avoided Morgan Freeman's Ross character as he barely has much to do. The action sequences, fights are another highlight. The choreography is simply stunning. <br/><br/>For me the stars of the show are Danai Gurira as Okoye and Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia. Both are extemely brilliant actresses. For the previous, she has such a commanding presence on screen and her dialogue delivery is top-notch. Although she remains tough, she comes alive even in small emotional bits. The Latter nailed the part of Nakia with great balance of vulnerability and emotions. Both the characters stay with you even after the screening has concluded. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the film, although this is not a perfect film by all means, but its a deeply satisfying superhero experience."

Good: The outifts were very colorful, and the African art looked nice. 
Bad: 1) an advanced society that has a monarchy, has fight-challenges, and with knives and spears? 2) how does a society become so advanced when cut-off from the world? the people there are an order-of-magnitude more intelligent than others? they sure didn't act it. 3) I understand what they were trying to do with the Africanized-English accents, but it made it hard to understand the dialogue at many points, 4) because the dialogue was not clear, the plot and subplots were lost on me. All I know is that they were all related and some relaties killed each other and there was revenge ... I really didn't feel anything for these characters, so I didn't rerun the scenes on the DVD, 5) no memorable special effects, 6) no cool, great music theme.

Marvel triumphs with BLACK PANTHER, which beautifully blends elements from African and African-American culture into all the ingredients that make an amazing action film: a noble hero who has as much to prove to himself as others, a villian who is as charismatic as he is evil, and an alluring, magical setting complete with out-of-this-world technology. Plus, the movie has an awesome soundtrack and score, both of which I now listen to on my own time. I believed bad reviews to be accurate, until I actually went to see the movie and judge it for myself. I sat in the theater, completely engaged, waiting for the movie to get bad.

","This has to be the most Overhyped Movie I've seen this Year many saying this was the Best Superhero Movie, which felt like a pretty Bold Statement, but Therfore i was intrigued to see what all the Hype was about an... Boy was this Movie a Huge Letdown, now I really wanted to Like this Movie Black Panther was one of the best parts of Civil War an i was looking forward to where they'd take his character and they did Nothing with his Character he already had a Great Arc in Civil War as a Side Character yet somehow in his own Movie he feels Bland and That's the worst thing a Marvel Character can be cause they make Great Choices with the Actors that can Elevate the Material there Given, Chadwick Boseman who is a Great Actor was not good in this an I hate to say that cause his Scene in Civil War was some of the Best Acting I'd seen in a Marvel Movie, so for his First Solo Movie to be so Plain and feels empty which Sucks cause each Marvel Movie has a Distinct Tone an Vision the Director Brings, but Ryan Coogler who made Creed which is so Much Better than its Deserves to be, has made a Movie that feels like it has No Personality, its up there with Dr Strange or Ant-Man in terms of Style an even those Movies had Creative Action Scenes which all the Marvel Movies have done a pretty Great Job delivering, the Action in this besides a pretty Cool Car Chase which is elevated by the Music, any other action scene was Very Poorly handled from Terrible CGI and its not like the Movie doesn't have the Budget they just half-assed it when it came to the Action, Each Marvel Movie before has done a Good job with being Fun Popcorn that'll entertain, but this is one of the least Entertaining Movies they've put out in a while it was Boring in parts an that's the worst thing these Movies can be is Boring cause if the Action Sucks than the only thing you can Enjoy is the Story an Character's, Before seeing this I'd heard comparisons to Game of Thrones, and James Bond, besides the Normal Outsider comes to Dethrone the King that reminded me of The Lion King, it brings nothing New or Fresh to the Table besides a pretty Good Soudtrack, but other than that the Story was Generic you can predict where the stories can go, there was a Twist in the Movie that somewhat surprised me but that's pretty much it. The Characters in these Movies have had pretty strong Side Character's i can't say the same for this Movie, the Only Entertaining Character is Michael B Jordan as one of the better Marvel Villians but he feels like he's barley in the Movie he has his Introduction Scene, then leaves for awhile an doesn't return til the Low point Of the Story that Most of these Movies have an it was so Cliched an I don't get how People thought he was Dead in that scene, and if you ask me that scene should've taken place earlier in the Movie then we could see the Struggle of Black Panther coming back to the Throne but he just leaves for 10 mins an shows up then Beats the Bad Guy an everyone Wins, So Michael B Jordan is the Best Part of this Movie but he's barley in it enough so What are we left with... Well all of the other Characters are pretty Boring to watch not just the Character's but the scenes there in feel Pointless all they do is walk around and talk about unnecessary Stuff, the only interactions that where entertaining was Black Panther an his Sister who was a good Character until she became the ""Comedic Relief"" her Jokes didn't get a single laugh from me an besides making Cool Gear for the Hero she doesn't really have much of a Character, the Script feels rather Dry almost Like it was Written an Directed by a Machine it cause besides one Cool Shot nothing about this Movie felt Unique like everyone is Praising it to be, Before this Movie I had seen Thor Ragnarok an that Movie captures everything you'd Want from a Marvel Movies its Funny, its Creative, you can Feel the Director's Vision an Style it felt Different. This was a huge Downgrade over Ragnarok, an it is one of the Most Generic Superhero Movies I've seen in awhile so if your one of those People that Loves it cause you feel Empowered by having a Black Superhero Movie that's Great I just can't say i feel the same way, there are much better ""Black Movies"" out there as this is being called and Overall I'd give this a 4/10 it was very Dissapointing to Me besides one Cool Action scene along with one Good Performance this movie felt like one of the first Marvel Movies like Thor or Captain America but with a slightly better Budget but they didn't use it as well as they could've"

I've been on this planet for 30yrs and feel like ""finally, a black movie that I can show my daughter and nephews that doesn't include a white master or the abuse of a black female"" I can't imagine how a black person born in the 40s/50s/60s/70s felt watching this."

","Short Review -
I personally liked it after watching thrice. The simple plot & the emotional factors were good but after seeing Rotten Tomatoes giving 98% and Metacritic giving 88 I was unflattered. Yeah it's a good movie but no near The Dark Knight.
Visuals sucks (comparing it's budget) & so many plot holes.
It's a good movie but not the best superhero movie."
"grandmoffkark","3","0","1","10 August 2018"," Seriously Overrated...like most popular films.
","Black Panther is one of the worst films Marvel Entertainment have ever released. This was a film made around a cool character in Captain America 3: Civil War, and it was made for two reasons: A.) To pander to SJW-BLM types, B.) To explain the country of Wakanda for Infinity War. It met aim A.) very well...didn't meet B.) very well however. To expand on why it didn't; allow me to explain. Black Panther barely explores the nation of Wakanda, it briefly mentions how the became a technological powerhouse, yet doesn't explain why the properties of vibranium were so potent and how they discovered this. Character's like Tony Stark would have studied vibranium based off of Caps. shield. This is silly, and only proceeds to establish the priorities of the writers; that being to create characters that can pander to the audience. This was effectively the first 5 minutes of the film. Just to give you perspective on how utterly incompetent it is. Later on in the film we're told about how the Black Panther gets his power. It's is granted through a special plant...a plant that only one person is allowed to use...which is the most stupid thing I've ever heard. It's stupid for two main reasons: A.) Why would you not grant all of your soldiers the special flower-power? They would effectively become an unstoppable fighting force. Wakanda Warrior (Teechalla or something like that) is useless without it; illustrating how powerful it can make a mere weakling. B.) If the answer to A.) is along the lines of ""Giving too many people the flower-power would decrease the significance of the Black Panther"" you would be correct. It is clearly done for plot reasons, as without the flower power; Wakanda Warrior would be useless. However, my question would then be; Why, if Wakandan Scientists have shown an innate ability to manipulate resources that possess unique properties, have the Wakanda scientists been unable to either: Strengthen the potency of the Flower-power, thus giving the Black Panther even greater abilities over the foot soldiers, or make a weakened version; thus also maintaining the Black Panther's superiority. Either of those make far greater sense than simply restricting it to one member of society. This incompetence then also brings into question whether or not Wakandan people are actually intelligent, or if it was just done for plot reasons...do you see my point yet? Thus far the film has explained a version of Wakanda that does not exist in Infinity War, it is a nation of Plot Armour, Lazy writing, and unintelligent scientists (or writers). This trend continues to occur with the rest of the film, failing to explain how advancements in vibranium led to shield cloaks. The film is simply ridiculous, and the only thing it did successfully was pander to it's audience. Congratulations I guess. Don't watch it, don't support it in any way; else you are simply telling the writers to make more poorly written films like this in future instalments. What a waste of my time.."
"ilwilever","10","0","1","8 August 2018"," One of Marvels Best. Dont listen to Haters
","Black Panther is amazing in everyway. The story is set up his story very well for future installments and it was nice seeing a film with a majority Black cast. There is an overwhelming amount of movies where the hero is white and its nice to see something different for a change. <br/><br/>Killmonger played my Michael B Jordan is a villian i have been waiting to see in the mcu. I was even rooting for the him at times through out the movie. One thing about Black Panther is he set himself apart from other Superheros. Most Superheros work alone but Black Panther was a team player, he wasnt yhe know it all, and just because he was the one in charge he was open to the opinion of his warriors who were women. The women were submissive but strong, smart and ideal. I thought that was awesome.<br/><br/>Black Panther is action packed with a very powerful message. I think a lot of people are giving it bad reviews because they did not like it has a majority Black Cast and did better than most Marvel movies. MCU movies like the first Iron Man is waaaaaay over rated. Black Panther runs circles around the majority of marvel movies. The cast starred the best actors and actresses in hollywood. Watch this movie with an open mind. It tells a story about how a lot Black people feel in general. When i went to see this movie people of all races were clapping and enjoying the film. Everyone loved it. Dont listen to the haters and see it for yourself"
"cmoser-84920","7","0","1","8 August 2018"," Average Marvel Movie w/h Less Than Average CGI
","A little late of a review, but the overall movie was fairly good. I personally liked some of the cultural aspects to make Wakanda feel more realistic and unique. Some parts were a little off (designating a set ""Challenge day"" to fight T'Challa but Killmonger being able to magiczlly override that due to story progression being one), but not to the point of being distracting from the overall plot. No real complaints other than the overwhelming lack of effort put into the CGI. The rhinos were somewhat understandable, but the digital Velociraptors from Jurassic Park (yes, Park. Not World, Park.) looked more beileveable than pretty much the whole final duel between the two Panthers. In some areas (The first challenge for the throne comes to mind), the background looked so incredibly cheesy as if they didnt even try to hide the fact it was greenscreen. Other than the lacking visuals this is still a fairly good movie."

This is an action packed movie that doesn't take itself too seriously (and you shouldn't either). The CG is far from perfect and downright bad in certain scenes. This movie is also like most comic book movies where the story is pretty predictable with only a few twists. So is it perfect? No. Is it the worst movie ever that deserves only 1-3 stars?

The movie is better than Age of Ultron, GOTG2, and probably the same way I view Civil War in terms of score.<br/><br/>The problem is the music was terrible, the CGI was blatant, and the movie lacked beautiful women. Believe it or not, bald women are not beautiful. Where were the models and thick women and so on. This felt like a feminist, SJW wet dream.<br/><br/>The message was whites are bad and Blacks are victims. Blacks have lost, not because of low IQ or lack of ability, but the man. What a terrible message.<br/><br/>The movie is basically egging on Blacks to commit crimes in a false belief that Wakanda is a real place and if you cannot find it, it is because the man took it from you.<br/><br/>The movie besides poor music and lacking beauty, it was missing a transition. One moment someone is fighting, the next sad. One moment a character has motivation then it magically disappears. Why was the Black Panther saved? Why was the King betrayed? Why, why why?<br/><br/>Of course, all the men must be femsplained and talked down to. This is a terrible movie in terms of ideology, terrible for men as it makes men seems weak while empowering women to talk down to them.<br/><br/>If a man slaps a lion, the lion kills. If a woman slaps a man...............<br/><br/>This movie is not great, but not awful or bad. It's a 5 to a 6.

","Black Panther is one of the decent Marvel movies and I easily give it a 7 but that is a 7 that heavily leans on 6.
I think that the problem is the hype that was around this movie and how among some this title has become untouchable and if you show anything other than enthusiasm you are called some really nasty stuff.
However this film is not bad, or good, it is just decent.
I personally expected much more out of Chadwick Boseman in this film considering his prior films however it is unfortunate to see him almost devoid of all charisma and charm, the main villain Michael B Jordan is just really good in this film and made Chadwick look pretty weak in comparison as an actor, but in reality Michael was not the only one that was considerably more entertaining to watch than Chadwick in Black Panther.
The sound design is pretty good but the script needed more ironing out as it had a fair amount of lazy writing issues.
Another problem in my eyes is the special effects specially the CGI in the movie were pretty low quality in several places.
All in all I would give this movie a 7 mainly because of how good Miachael B Jordan was as Killmonger."
"shakercoola","6","0","2","29 July 2018"," Brilliant spectacle. Its story thrust was left to viewer's imagination
","An American action film; A story about a new ruler of a hidden African nation who faces a challenge for his throne. Assisted by his tribe's forces and a CIA agent, the new King is soon locked in a life-or-death struggle for the future of the world. This is a film which has multiple themes including isolationism vs threat of openness, and the notion of what wealthy nations owe to the poor and oppressed.
Few Marvel films work better tonally than this. The battle action sequences, which overcrowed the story in the other films in the Marvel series, have more purpose here. By no means does ""Black Panther"" transcend the action genre but it certainly embraces it in a skilful way. It has a plentiful array of costumes, inspiring set design, and different cultural elements which are well-observed and impressively rendered using CGI which provide a beautiful backdrop of a near idyll.
However, the characters are not easily distinguishable from the beauty and sweeping majesty of the stage backcloth and it is impeded by the studio's anodyne dialogue which feels like design-by-committee. T'Challa, the King, is po-faced and no more interesting for what he says than Captain America and Thor who also lack dimension. Martin Freeman's character was smooth-talking but drab and with a turn of phrase of a freshman, not an airman. In contrast, Michael B. Jordan's villain ignited the film giving it a spring in its step, while Andy Serkis gave us a character of some verve albeit brief.
All in all, it looks fabulous, but its thematic assertions were feint."

","I only watched this film due to a review of the 'must see' movies of 2018, I have to say I was disappointed. I think in many respects this was a missed opportunity to create something completely different in the Marvel pantheon. The initial premise of having mainly black actors and a strong female presence is laudable, but sadly I felt this became simply a token gesture. I think the cultural and political messages could have been much stronger and this would have created a far more absorbing and challenging storyline. Some other reviewers expressed disappointment in the fight scenes and poor cgi; this didn't bother me too much, but at times it felt very derivative and a regurgitation of set pieces from other films, and at times became all a bit Lord of the Rings. All in all, I felt the film lacked the depth and inventiveness that it promised and if it had been a bit more daring, could have added a new perspective to this genre."

","The great characters, action and setting make 'Black Panther' an extremely enjoyable Marvel film and one of the MCU's best. The film is always entertaining, bolstered by an amazing score by Ludwig GÃ¶ransson that really captures the essence of the flick, and the self-contained story feels refreshing as it's never concerned with setting up further films, only being good in its own right. While the plot is quite predictable, the writing ensures that the audience always care about the characters and are invested in the narrative, leading to one of the more engaging stories of the MCU. The film is also definitely an ensemble piece, and, as good as Chadwick Boseman is in the role of T'Challa, it sometimes feels like the eponymous 'Black Panther' is outshined by the outstanding characters that surround him. That's certainly not a bad thing though, as it means that every major character has their own moment to shine - including T'Challa himself, who gets several of the film's best moments. Although the CGI looks unfinished in some of the action scenes, risking a disconnect between the characters and the audience, the action is always enthralling - a stand out being the entire South Korea sequence - and this is in part due to how invested we are in the story and how much we care about the characters. Overall, 'Black Panther' is an always entertaining superhero flick, with fantastic characters and action, that ranks as one of the MCU's best to date. 8/10"

","Black Panther is a great movie. It has plenty of flaws, but none that really should discourage you from seeing it. The only thing that really bugs me is the terrible, obnoxious hype for just an average film for Marvel. It doesn't have an underlying message or stands for empowerment. It has none of that. What it does have is black leads who do a good job and a fanbase larger than Michael Bay's ego. Chadwick Boseman's character, T'Challa, becomes the Black Panther after his father dies, and must fight to protect his kingdom, all while trying to live up to the previous Black Panther's legacy.<br/><br/>The graphics, acting, and general scale of this movie is astonishing. Not much else can be said. This movie takes you on a trip you can only really remember for a short while. What you will remember is the media circus about how 'This movie changes the course of cinema' or 'The black community has changed in so many different ways'. There are better movies that get empowerment and representation across better than Black Panther. Ryan Coogler made a wonderful experience that, when watching, has nothing but action to offer on a dark-skinned platter.<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman made Black Panther interesting. As the star of the show, he makes his way pretty good. Michael B. Jordan, however, was the real master of acting in the film. Him as Killmonger was a match made in heaven. Lupita Nyong'o was very entertaining and well-written, and Danai Gurira was badass and awesome. Daniel Kaluuya and Winston Duke did just fine, and they made the film better, but not like MBJ did. Letita Wright was funny, except for the awful, awful dead memes that she referenced (you know which ones). Angela Bassett was entertaining, and Forest Whitaker did amazing (two performances that no one seems to mention). But the two that were easily my favorites were Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis. They may the only two white actors, but they were still entertaining. Seeing Freeman act in such an exotic and strange culture was great, and Serkis did phenomenal in being intimidating and yet still crazy. Overall, an A- in the acting department.<br/><br/>Black Panther is just another Marvel movie. If you want to see it, good. I recommend it. For me, I just find it very average and okay. The acting is great, the visuals are great, things seem fluent and balanced, and the real film isn't very political. 7 out of 10!"

But to me, storyline is bit disappointing. A villain came to wakanda, claimed his throne & also got it by trail combat. Its kinda like, cap america can also be a King if he can beat panther. ( & i think, cap can beat panther) with storyline, the movie great. i enjoyed it :)"

Black Panther wants to pass along some good to the world and opens this nation to the eyes of others. Many scenes from Atlanta and good to see a new character brought to life on the big screen.

","Review:
After avoiding all of the spoilers, I finally got to watch this movie, which I quite enjoyed but I did think that Infinity War was better. I liked the fact that most of the cast was black, as it is based in Africa, and the way that the director had a lot of powerful women, which you don't see in a majority of superhero movies. The action scenes were also impressive and the cinematography was truly amazing but I did find the Black Panther quite moody and miserable through most of the movie. That's not to say that Chadwick Boseman didn't play the main character well, it's just that it lacked wit, and the storyline could have been a bit more interesting. Anyway, if you have seen Captain America: Civil War, you would have seen T'Challa/Black Panther, sadly losing his father, so in this movie you see him return to Wakanda, to assume the throne. His hometown is isolated from the world, mainly because of its advanced technology, powered by vibranium, During the ceremony, T'Challa is challenged by the Jabari Tribe leader, M'Baku (Winston Duke), who he successfully defeats and becomes king. Meanwhile Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) and Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) steal a Wakandan artefact from a London museum, and Klaue tries to sell it in South Korea but the deal is interrupted by the Black Panther and 2 of his close companions. During the battle, Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman) is badly hurt whilst saving T'Challa's friend, so they take him back to Wakanda, so they can use there technology to save him, even though they don't want to expose there abilities to the outside world. T'Challa then finds out that his father killed his brother to save Wakanda, and he left his nephew in America at a young age. As Klaue knows the secret about the power of vibranium, the Wakanda's have tried to get there hands on him for years but he always seems to slip through there fingers. Erik, who turns out to be the young kid who was left in America, knows that the Wakanda's want Klaue, so he kills him and he uses his dead body to get into Wakanda. After exposing his true identity, he challenges T'Challa to a battle for the throne, which he successfully wins, thinking that he has killed the Black Panther. With Erik in power, he attempts to distribute Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world, not knowing that T'Challa was picked up by fishermen after being thrown into a waterfall. His mother, sister and girlfriend decide to leave Wakanda when Erik took power, and they make there way to the Jabari Tribe to take cover. They then see a badly beaten T'Challa in a coma, so they use some herbs to bring him back to life. Now fully revived, the Black Panther decides to take back Wakanda from Erik, before he distributes the weapons but the tribe are forced to fight for the king, which means that he has to battle against his close friends. Will he claim back his beloved Wakanda or will Erik use his new powers to defeat him! I know that I might have made the plot sound really confusing but it will make sense when you watch it. I did find the leader of the Jabari Tribe, M'Baku, quite funny, and the Black Panthers sister, Shuri, and Nakia were brilliant. Martin Freeman seemed a bit out of place but I understand why he was put into the movie. For a third world country, there technology was unbelievable, and it put Tony Stark to shame, but I honestly don't think that we have seen it's full power yet. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch and I can understand why there was so much hype surrounding the movie but I personally preferred Ragnarok. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Ryan Coogler, 32, who also brought you Fruitvale Station and Creed. For his third movie, he has certainly smashed the box office, and he has established his name in Hollywood. With only one project in development, which is a drama called Wrong Answer, he's decided to put Michael B. Jordan in the lead again, like he did in Creed and Fruitvale Station. At such a young age, he was lucky to be chosen to direct and write this movie, and I'm sure that Marvel is happy with the outcome, as it is the 9th biggest film of all time. It is the highest grossing film from a black director and the second highest grossing film in 2018, being beat by Infinity War, so DC really do have a hard act to follow. It would have been a totally different movie if Wesley Snipes took the lead, which was planned in 1992 but it never materialised due to disagreements over the script.<br/><br/>Budget: $210million
Worldwide Gross: $1.346billion (WOW!)<br/><br/>Genre: Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi 
Cast: Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Winston Duke, Sterling K. Brown, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker, Andy Serkis, Isaach De Bankole and Letitia Wright. 7/10"

","I have been having a hard time with my own review system, just my own opinion of movies. It's not because I don't like something but when compared to garbage something that isn't garbage seems good. Having said that I am not sure where all the hate comes from for this movie, so many 1's and 2's in the reviews. <br/><br/>It's no masterpiece but it was more fun to watch than Ant Man and I would give Ant Man a solid 6, hell I hated Iron Fist and I would give that a 5. Compared to those this movie is a 7 for me. Compared to some of the greatest movies of all time, maybe a high 5 low 6, but not close to a 1 or 2.<br/><br/>Awesome graphics for the most part - humans jumping around are hard and I watch it on an older LCD 55"" so some of the shots/transitions are messed up/blurry for me, this seems to happen with a lot of the bigger CGI scenes (not just this movie for me). <br/><br/>The acting was ok, I liked the 2 main characters they seemed real and flushed out enough. I thought Jordan's acting was a little under whelming but still ok. No one stood out as a stinker.<br/><br/>The story was very mediocre - you could have bet money on the outcome after hearing they were going to make this movie... or any Marvel movie that is. Good guy vs bad guy - guess what happens. But the backdrop and the way they present the movie saves the day in my books. The fight scenes could have used less CGI but other than that it was an entertaining flick."

","SPOILER: I was told this movie was amazing and Killmonger was a great villain. Killmonger was boring and laughable. He is supposed to be this intelligent black ops soldier but for some reason he just screams out what are supposed to be ""hip"" and ""cool"" phrases and never really says anything of substance. The acting for Killmonger is awful and the actor seems to have just read the lines while he was drunk as their is nothing convincing about the character. Pull anyone off the street and they could rattle off Killmonger's lines in the exact same way: lifeless. What is up with the bad accent? Barely any of the actors are good enough to do this ""African"" accent but they insist on it and it's confusing. Why would a country in Africa that isolates itself and despises colonizers speak only English? They wouldn't. They would speak their own language. The filmmakers should have had the actors speak a native language or speak their regular English with no accent. You can barely understand anything said in that joke of an accent but at least it provides one of the few laughs. <br/><br/>Also, in the middle of Africa their is a random snow mountain that is minutes from warm Wakanda? Supposedly the director thought that having an African tribe in the jungle was ""too logical"" or something so he decided to put them on a freezing mountain. That kind of decision making is evident throughout. The director tried to spice things up without realizing the idiocy of it. The director gets in their own way again and again and it's sad because this could have been done well."

"dreygo-93509","6","0","1","9 June 2018"," The Black Panther party...
","I enjoyed Black Panther. It was a boilerplate Marvel movie that did not disappoint. The story was exciting, albeit predictable, and the visual experience cannot help but to give one pleasure. The artistic value of the film fell flat, and I was left wanting for any profound depth, but during an adrenaline filled journey to distant lands I didn't miss it. The theme had some modern relevance, though I will have to admit it was difficult not to recognize the homage to the black equivalent of the KKK in both the movie name and the hero's identity. Once you establish that to an audience prior to entering the theater, I think you are allowed some unchallenged aggressions that could have been written by Colin Kaepernick (calling the only white guy in the movie ""colonizer"" was ridiculous).<br/><br/>Another thing this did was to create a certain fear on the part of movie critics in bringing all of their intellectual clarity to bear. I noticed some movie services have this movie ranked higher than ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Amadeus"" or ""American Beauty"". That rating is absolutely delusional. I give IMDb a lot of credit for keeping things in perspective. This movie, while quite entertaining, will be long forgotten while those true pieces of artistry are still being enjoyed.<br/><br/>All in all, if you like Marvel movies, you are going to like this one as I did. If super hero movies are not your thing, then this movie is too blunt an instrument (mind wandering to Amadeus) to change your mind."

","Full disclosure, I am from South Africa. And yes, I am white. Although that should not be a problem in this day and age, and if it is for you then please slink back into the stone age hole you crawled out of.<br/><br/>Before watching this movie I was really excited. Everyone was singing this movie's praises to high heaven and back on all critic sites. So of course I watched it, not just because of the glowing reviews, but because I follow the MCU as well.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this movie is not the paragon of all super hero movies that most positive reviews say it is. There are seriously way more better Marvel movies out there that has released in the last few years. The action was boring, the acting was okay, and the fact that the side characters and main villain was more interesting than the main character doesn't bother me at all, heck, that's what Batman is famous for as well after all. I did like the futuristic African warrior style tech in the movie though.<br/><br/>But I am not going to slam this movie like every man/woman child on the web by giving it a 1-3/10 either. Ratings like that should be reserved for crap like the 50 shades and Twilight films in all honesty, as this movie is not as terrible as the nay-sayers are claiming it to be and voting it low due to a knee-jerk reaction for buying into the hype train. It doesn't deserve that as all.<br/><br/>Now as for the bloody critic reviews: critics must have been afraid to score this movie low or was paid or scared to justify their scores to vote what most people are claiming to be the first ""black super hero movie"". First of, you're an idiot for thinking that. Did everyone just forget Steel was a thing? You know, with Shaq? In 1997? Guess what? It sucked. And it was panned. And nothing happened. How about that? No wonder people forgot it then hey? But then again a poor Irish reviewer did pan it and was barraged by an onslaught of angry SJWs about it, thus weeding out constructive criticism for smart people who want to see both sides to a coin, and hence people fall for the hype. <br/><br/>And secondly, people saying it's pushing an anti-white agenda: you are the reason we as a human race cannot move forward and everything wrong with humanity.<br/><br/>TL:DR I enjoyed the movie, but the experience was slightly marred by these people giving it 10/10 and making it out to be better than all Marvel movies, so my expectations were astronomical, and unfortunately, those expectations weren't met."

And make no mistake, the experience & joy of watching an Black Cast delivering explosive action & drama, is one of its own. The Writing is well-done, although the second-hour does give inn to many cliches, that do effect its impact overall. But, for the most part, the Writing is nicely sustained. Coogler's Direction is superb. The Director seems to be confident & assured in his first blockbuster directorial effort. Cinematography & Editing are done with merit. Art & Costume Design are excellent. Graphics are top-notch. Action-Sequences are simply spell-binding. Ludwig Göransson's score is rocking.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther, is charismatic all through. He has the heroic presence to hold his own. Michael B.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","1","4 June 2018"," Marvel's answer to DC's ""Wonder Woman""
","""Black Panther"" and ""Wonder Woman"", two of the most successful genre movies based on Marvel and DC comics respectively, have something in common, something that may well be the key ingredient to their success. They are both founded on a rich mythological background which is solid enough for the audience to related to (i.e. not as farfetched as ""Thor""). <br/><br/>By this time, the story of ""Black Panther"" must be so generally known that even a brief outline is superfluous. Still, I'll attempt one, just bare backbone of the story, with no reference to narrative style (which includes a few simple flashbacks). <br/><br/>In Wakanda, a near-Utopia kingdom in Africa whose mind-boggling technological advancement is hidden from the rest of the world, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) becomes King upon the death of his father (see ""Captain America: Civil War"" for details of the assassination) after defeating a challenge to combat in accordance with tradition. His rule initially goes smoothly as he is loyally supported by mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett), mentor Zuri (Forest Whitaker), technology wiz-kid sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), ferocious warrior General Okoye (Danai Gurira) and ex-girlfriend comr spy Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o). <br/><br/>Then a crisis develops upon the emergence of an evil arms dealer Klaue (Andy Serkis, in his ""human"" face) who is inexplicably in possession of a small quantity of vibranium, Wakanda's national treasure, a rare metal that can be used to construct the most formidable weaponry. With the help of friendly C.I.A. operative Everett Ross (Martin Freeman), T'Challa and company tries to capture Klaue. This in turn leads to deeper secrets of something that happened when T'Challa was a child, something that Zuri has been at great pains to hide from him. <br/><br/>The key villain finally emerges, one Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) who, laying claim on direct bloodline, challenges T'Challa for the throne. So much for the aforementioned ""bare backbone"". The rest of the plot unfolds more or less as expected. <br/><br/>Ryan Coogler, director of ""Creed"" (2015), the successful continuation of the ""Rocky"" legend with a tonal and theme variation, brings the same skill and touch to ""Black Panther"". No movie in this genre can succeed without pleasing the expectant audience with exciting action sequences, and ""Black Panther"" certainly misses nothing there. But what puts this movie a cut above the others is the heart-breaking pathos that Coogler brings, and Jordan (the lead in ""Creed"") delivers.<br/><br/>But, don't get me wrong. If you are looking for fun and laughs, you get plenty in ""Black Panther"". When Ben Whishaw took over as the second generation ""Q"" in ""Skyfall"", you might think that this sort of superhero-tech-support role (such as Morgan Freeman in ""Batman"") cannot get any cuter. I thought so too, until I saw Letitia Wright as baby sister Shuri in ""Black Panther"". <br/><br/>The cast is splendid, Wright being one among them. Boseman has earned his place, now firmly established, with the superheroes. Jordan delivers a villain that has made critics cry. Freeman brings with him a hint of the unique Bilbo mix of vulnerability and courage, plus a sprinkle of craziness. The four main supports, from two generations, are solid: Nyong'o, Gurira, Bassett, Whitaker. And it is good to see, once in a while, Serkis as neither an ape of a degenerated Hobbit. <br/><br/>Many critics mention the political statement, which is loud and clear: survival with inclusion; and annihilation with isolation. Although it happens to be very relevant currently, this is not new to someone who is familiar with the great ""Foundation"" series of the late Isaac Asimov where the concept does not only encompass the Earth, but our entire Universe (there are billions of other universes that are potential threats to our existence)."

"phanly-74267","3","0","1","2 June 2018"," Black Panther: Don't Believe The Hype
","Black Panther is one of the most over-hyped movies I have ever seen. Most people have completely forgotten about this movie only a few months after its release in February due to its simplistic story, characters, and terrible presentation. People who still believe that this film has a deep political message are not to be taken seriously in regards to their opinions on movies.<br/><br/>The cinematography in Black Panther is very basic with no unique style. The characters are extremely bland and although their motivations are easy to understand, they are never fleshed out enough for the audience to become emotionally invested and attached to them. Chadwick Boseman delivers a very average performance and Michael B. Jordan is easily the weakest actor in the film. The supporting cast is completely forgettable and this only becomes more apparent when we spend 20 minutes with them when the audience is supposed to believe that T'Challa is dead. I honestly can't understand why the people who wrote the script decided to include this in the film. Who do they think they are fooling? Anyone with a brain knows he's alive especially because Black Panther was in the Infinity War trailer that was released before his solo movie was in theaters. 
 
Before my first viewing of the film I was told by people who had seen the movie that Michael B. Jordan's character (Killmonger) rivals Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker in The Dark Knight (2008). Not only is this an insult to what I personally consider to be the greatest cinematic performance of all time, but is the second worst performance I have ever seen form Jordan (First being his terrible portrayal of The Human Torch in the latest Fantastic Four film). I often find myself comparing the action in this film to the action in Man of Steel (2013), completely tension less and confusing. The special effects are poor despite the film having a budget of 200 million dollars and the humor is terrible. <br/><br/>The only thing I can truly give the movie credit for is the coloring. I'm glad that Marvel movies have bee adapting more color into their films in order to make the movie more visually appealing. Overall, this is one of the most forgettable movies in the Marvel cinematic universe and I can't say I recommend it."

But Black Panther I have to say was well below that average.<br/><br/>The action scenes were bland and not on par with other Marvel/DC movies and the CGI, which there is a lot of, was surprisingly mediocre. The story was bland and didn't make much sense to me. Something about some metal with magical properties giving both enhanced super powers and technology and they managed to somehow hide that from the rest of the world by isolating and hiding a whole country? <br/><br/>I mean in a world like Marvel where you have SHIELD and other super-spy organisations, none of them could figure out this high tech country? No, that is just nonsense, even for a comic book movie.<br/><br/>The characters were not that very interesting either. You have more than the usual dose of feminism with super smart and super strong female characters, none of which had much depth and were there just because they were women. The villain in the movie did show some promise but they didn't really explore him much and the hero, Black Panther, I can't say had neither the flare of Tony Stark nor the heart of Peter Parker. He was just another bland character in a bland movie with bland actors."

"adam-may-bower","9","0","1","2 June 2018"," Exhilarating
","'Black Panther' is not only an achievement for its mainly-black cast and positive representations of women, but it is also an exhilarating and meaningful superhero film. Before even this film had hit cinemas, it was already getting acclaim for the fact that this is a blockbuster superhero film and nearly everyone in the film is a person of color. This accomplishment only gets better once you actually see the film, and see a broad range of black characters that are not stereotyped, one-dimensional or a product of tokenism. To make things even better, the representation of women in this film is on point - they are not sexualized or dependent on their male counterparts. Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira lead out the strong female characters fiercely, equally giving strong performances that affirmed that they are both tremendous actresses. Every cast member in this film does a great job in their role, with Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, and Andy Serkis being the male standouts. As for the storyline, it's as good as a superhero film plot can get. There are enough plot twists to save the film from its ultimately predictable ending that is in pretty much every superhero film. It was refreshing to have a break from the whole ""save-the-world"" trope and have a change of focus to identity, culture, and humanity - and still, have badass action sequences in the process. The soundtrack to this film is nothing short of awesome, with its strong African-influence combined with an epic orchestral score making it one of the best superhero scores I have heard. Overall, 'Black Panther' is a triumph due to being a brilliant film in its own right, and also for its positive representations of minority groups. We need more films like this one."

"codfather-84460","6","0","1","1 June 2018"," Boring, unfunny and kind of good?
","When the movie Black Panther first came out, it was given really high scores by critics and audiences alike so going in to first watch this movie, I was pretty pumped to watch it but walking out, I realised that it dragged most of the time, the action felt pretty sloppy sometimes and most of the humour felt pretty unfunny but hey, the villain is probably the best I've seen in any MCU movie in a long time.<br/><br/>Starting with the most notable of positives, the villain, Kilmonger. At first, he just seems like yet another bland, boring and terrible villain but later on you begin to realise his true motivation which is his belief that Wakanda should be put on the map which he tries to get everyone to believe which is so well done that it saves this movie alone from being considered another average, lacklustre Marvel movie which in itself is a big accomplishment which is kind of incredible. <br/><br/>Something minor is Klaw, the supposed main villain until Kilmonger kills him, is probably the funniest part of this movie, whose lines are executed very well by Andy Serkis who I kind of hated in Avengers 2 as the scenes were really mediocre at best but he's actually pretty good which is a relief as Ryan Coogler said 'Hey, we can do justice to this character still, right?' and I'll give it to the guy, he did it pretty well.<br/><br/>The performances given by Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan in particular are phenomenal. I really liked Chadwick Boseman in Captain America: Civil War and I can say the same for this movie. However, Michael B. Jordan steals the show. Not only is he written superbly, he is by far the most competent out of everyone else in the movie as he's been in other blockbusters like Creed which I really enjoyed in the end.<br/><br/>The major gripe I possess is that the movie mostly drags as most of it is political which is different, sure but it's a superhero movie so I don't really get invested in it at all most of the time.<br/><br/>While Klaw's humour worked for me, the rest certainly didn't. I can't believe that the movie actually has the audacity to think that the 'What are those?' joke is still funny as when it was used everyone laughed and I did not. I actually think that it made me angry because it wasn't funny back in 2014 or whenever it first was introduced, and it certainly wasn't funny in the cinema when saw it.<br/><br/>The action, which I usually regard as awesome in nearly every MCU movie is actually pretty lacklustre as the Wakandan tech used forces the movie to use makes the scenes really fake looking as the CG is ever so saturated within them. This however, only applies to the scenes where T'Challa is the Black Panther but when he fights Man-Ape and Kilmonger on the kingship battles because it doesn't have to rely on CG to carry potentially good action and make it all bombastically fake looking.<br/><br/>Overall, Black Panther is a movie that is a movie that I definitely consider to be one of the most overrated MCU movies in a while that I'm giving a six out of ten. Hopefully, Ryan Coogler gives us a equally interesting villain in the sequel to this because let's face it, it's inevitable that it will and he improves the overly comical and mostly sloppy action by giving us a balance between the story, the characters and the action."

"Mike_Devine","7","0","1","30 May 2018"," Marvel's first visit to Wakanda sets the bar high
","There's no denying 2018's Marvel universe entry 'Black Panther' made a major statement and had a monumental impact on society. The first film to follow the story of a black superhero struck a chord with audiences not only because it of its historical qualities, but because it was an entertaining, fresh action-adventure ride that breathed new life into the aging franchise.<br/><br/>At its core, 'Panther' follows a traditional hero narrative, following a somewhat unassuming leader from his rise to power to his fall from from grace and a nearly unsurmountable pathway to return to his position. We've seen this time after time in stories like 'The Lion King,' what makes it also work here is the fact that it has the ""Marvel touch"" - a great cast, good special effects, enough humor to keep audiences laughing and tons of formulaic yet expected stylized fight scenes.<br/><br/>While audiences first got to know T'Challa and Black Panther (played by Chadwick Boseman) in 'Captain America: Civil War,' it's clear he was ready to step into the spotlight. T'Challa is likable thanks to his serious yet cool outlook and commitment to the people of his homeland, Wakanda, and the people he surrounds himself with are a great foil. From his feisty younger sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) to his love interest Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o), he is in great company. Even those who are no fans of his, like outsider Eric Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) or frenemy W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) are effective in their roles. But the cast is nearly an endless sea of familiar, successful actors, from Forest Whitaker and Angela Bassett to Sterling K. Brown and Martin Freeman.<br/><br/>But acting is just a portion of why 'Panther' succeeds. Perhaps the best aspect of the film is the fact that it does not take itself too seriously. Don't get me wrong - this is no 'Deadpool' in the comedy department - but it strikes a near-perfect balance of sweet and salty. Also, the juxtaposition between poverty-stricken Oakland, CA, USA with the prosperous, hi-tech Wakanda, Africa does not go unnoticed. The natural beauty of the African setting is another element that helps set 'Panther' apart from other similar films.<br/><br/>Sure, it's understandable why some may say this film is a bit overrated, given the somewhat unoriginal plot. But the plot is not usually the reason you go to see movies like this. It's all about the entertainment value, and 'Black Panther' delivers on this front."
"kena-6","8","0","1","29 May 2018"," A movie with heart and soul
","When a script is written with passion and heart, you can feel it..a satisfying feeling after finishing the movie..truely a storyline with a soul. I can't help but comparing this with Star Wars Last Jedi. The villain Killmonger is how the character of Kylo Ren should have been written. Even though Killmonger is the villain, he is still one of my favourite characters in the movie. He is a tortured soul that acts out of hatred and ends up on the wrong path, even though he thinks his actions are righteous. I also like the fact that they chose to play the Marvel Studios logo after his introduction in the start. It was a unique and different way to place the logo, compared to other Marvel movies. At first it seemed weird, but after watching the movie you understand the intention. As the camera zoomed away from the kids looking up at the sky, the logo plays, which marked the birth of the future villain Killmonger. That was the turning point, and when rewatching that scene, it just plays out perfectly. Such small details are true movie art, unlike Last Jedi which tries hard, but ultimately turned out pretentious. The rest of the cast are also terrific, and I like the fact that they didn't add any unnecessary humour. Two big thumbs up for this one."

","Introducing the newest member of the avengers roster, teaming up with some heroes, we watch the black panther.
Through all the expectations to the all the facts after seeing the movie, it all leads to the conclusion that Marvel didn't want to make their tipycal variant of the good ordered blockbuster, but give a chance for something else, so the people could see other new members of the crew of Marvel.
Well, that ended pretty well with the high ratings and box office.
Some people find it great and awesome. Others find it worst movie of Marvel.
I have other opinion. It is good. But it is not great. To make more simple to think it:
The story and all the acting and assembling the whole pieces of the movie producing and filming is all top. But in the final, maybe even in the early too, phase of the making of the movie, seem to be mistakes, which do not blow everything up fortunately. The montage and some of the scenes, were awfully cut or placed. This kinda takes part of the enjoy of the film. And that's what is weird for the Marvel movies. They always are well planned and carefully made untill the final realease.
But this does not make any troubles, because I'm sure Marvel had that plan. And they do not find those mistakes fatal. The phase is completed, and they are ready to get back on track for perfection."

","Black Panther had great themes of brotherhood, family and diplomacy. Killmonger seemed like a flat character. His expression hardly changed when he does something and barely broke a sweat either. Seeing his fight with T'Challa was okay, the movements were fast but where's the technique? It was a fight between family so it felt sad rather than epic since Killmonger did have a royal right but he was more of an extremist.<br/><br/>T'Challa was a nicely developed character with internal conflicts between tradition and diplomacy for the preservation of his country versus personal feelings towards helping individuals. But the strange purple spirit world made it hard to watch and lessened the depth of emotions. Shuri had a funny personality with great character support such as the interesting scene with the car. While it was good to see Agent Ross participating, it almost seemed like his character is just along for the ride but it was amazing he risked his life and is willing to work with others. However, it seemed like his personality changed in the second half of the movie like he was quieter and reserved but maybe it's due to the shock of being in a high tech environment with hidden vibranium.<br/><br/>This movie reflects on several themes on deeper levels but the action, comedy and visual scenes does not make this movie very entertaining because it's not light-hearted but rather a real thinker!"

This movie is beautiful. <br/><br/>I'm a Marvel fan, so I definitely have a greater appreciation of this film than someone who isn't, but I went with my friend who's never seen an action or superhero movie in her life and she really enjoyed it too. <br/><br/>The acting is great; the villain is truly a sympathetic antagonist. His motives are clear. The film has quite a few unexpected twists that keep surprising you; there's enough comedy and a ton of color to make it fun. The protagonists are exceptional - you love them and feel them. <br/><br/>The visuals are spectacular! The film is based in a hidden country that comes to life on screen. You can believe it's real; you want to believe it's real. The creators of this film have created an entire new culture with such depth, showing off its tradition and color in so many different ways. 
At the same time, it's not too surreal (except for the nearly-magical and incredibly diverse Vibranium technology, which is kind of the whole point).

","It is definitely an action packed movie with an interesting story and a few plot twists. I thought it will be boring to watch it with this ""African"" culture, but in reality it is a mix of African and artificial culture, which kind of shows what African countries could have looked like if they had enough wisdom to create their own cultures like asian or european countries did. So it is interesting to watch this made up country with perfect technology, kind of Atlantida or something. Another reason why it was interesting to watch it was because of MARVEL. Their directors can make even a dumb idea look good, so it was indeed interesting. 
Anyways, it is probably one of the weakest Marvel movies in the recent years, even though the story is quite good, but I don't regret watching it, even though it is not really connected to any other Marvel movies.

","""Black Panther"" was definitely a novel treat, as it broke so many conventions. While not everything it did work, an generous amount of it did and did so in ways I did not expect. The movie definitely has a distinct visual style to present African culture. The cinematography was on-point, delivering vibrant scenery and fully captured the beauty of Wakanda. If I had to single out something that did not work for me, was the CGI. From the badly rendered rhino's to the video-game-like third act, it just didn't connect and at times was blatantly obvious. The performances were strong all-around. Chadwick Boseman got plenty of time to shine, and I was impressed by how much screen-time others, like Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Forest Whitaker, Letitia Wright and Daniel Kaluuya had. Each character had an important role to play, and they did those roles proper justice in my opinion. A pleasant surprise was Martin Freeman as the unassuming CIA Agent Everett Ross. His role was a lot larger than I thought, and his attitude towards superheroes and the Wakandans built a fun rapport that made the story a little more dynamic. Now the villains. I will say this now, Marvel has probably created one of their most fun and most nuanced villain in a while. Andy Serkis's motion capture free Ulysses Klaue was just plain fun to watch as he brought a charming flair rarely seen in other antagonists. Michael B. Jordan was the one I was skeptical about at first, as the trailers did not properly set him up. His moral views and goals where very understandable and it is rare to see a villain so desperate and so rightfully justified in his actions. Even T'Challa was a changed man at the end of it all, which further supports Killmonger's actions. Last but not least, Kendrick Lamar and his curated hit songs may not have gotten a huge spotlight, but with the occasional beats delivered by him, Vince Staples, The Weeknd and others, along with Aftican tribal numbers all but helped add another layer. ""Black Panther"" bucked usual superhero conventions with its cultural insight, villains, atmosphere and strongly-written characters while also remaining very much grounded in the MCU."

The story of Black Panther is also able to explore a more important idea than other superhero movies as well and also is able to explore lots of different complex but smaller ideas, like ""how can a good man be a great ruler but also be a murderer"" and ""why does a country that can solve all of the world's problems keep itself hidden from the world?"" The story is also able to explore lots of social issues (mostly race- related) and has an amazing twist that keeps the entire movie going and keeps it from getting boring. Chadwick Boseman does an amazing job of portraying the main character of T'Challa/Black Panther, he makes the character both diverse/witty/cool/serious/realistic all at the same time. Michael B. Jordan also does an equally-amazing job of portraying the movie's main villain-Erik Killmonger. He is both tough and soft, has a great backstory, and is very intimidating without having any superpowers. And at some points in the story, you will probably find yourself rooting for him as well. The supporting actors and actresses also do a great job too: Lupita Nyong'o portrays the character of Nakia with excellence giving her character a badass aura that needs to be seen on more female characters in popular film franchises. Danai Gurira does the exact same thing for her character of Okoye, and in turn she becomes a more deadly more fiercer female type of stormtrooper that could actually kill Luke Skywalker before he kills her. Letitia Wright gets first prize as funniest character though, in her breakout performance as Shuri: T'Challa's smart and witty inventor sister. And Daniel Kaluuya, Winston Duke, Sterling K. Brown, Angela Basset, Forest Whitaker, and Andy Serkis all do great jobs acting as W'Kabi, M'Baku, N'Jobu, Ramona, Zuri, and Ulysses Klaue. The only problem with the acting is Martin Freeman. What is he doing here? And why is he playing a lead character? It is just a little random, that's all. The action sequences are also amazing and expertly-executed. They look a lot like the action sequences in The Matrix with all of the slo-mo and detail. The movie's soundtrack is great as well. It combines both traditional African folk music, modern hip-hop and R&B, classical orchestra, and breezy pop. Ryan Coogler does a great job of directing the movie and, of course, the special effects and fast humor are top-notch. As well as the character development. And sure, Black Panther has its occasional problems (such as a constantly-occurring plot point and a sort of lacking final showdown between Panther and Killmonger). But all of the problems are really small and in the end, we are left with an amazing masterpiece of a blockbuster that will most likely transcend generations."

","Let me just start by saying that I'm usually too lazy to write reviews for a good movie. I usually only would go to the trouble of writing a review when I think something is bad and I want to vent. I think there are many people who are like me so perhaps that's the reason why I'm seeing so many poor reviews here. I'm writing this now because I feel like I just have to put this thought out there because there is user behavior bias to the review system, and people should be aware. I scrolled through some of the poor reviews and found that many of them think the movie is too flat or that the actors are not good. I mean, this is a Marvel movie, so don't go expecting the Titanic. If you like this line of story, you'll like it, if not, then don't watch it."
"AustinSober","7","0","1","19 May 2018"," 'Black Panther' Review: Another solid Marvel film, but not a Masterpiece
","""Black Panther"" serves as yet another solid entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, showcasing a wildly different world feel and a deeper story than previous entries, while still providing the staples that the devoted fan base enjoys. Many critics and audiences are proclaiming this as the best of the series and even saying that the film is a masterpiece. I feel that is stretch as there are some apparent issues with film's execution of action, effects, and actual focus of the story, regardless of depth. ""Black Panther"" is indeed a good film, but not a ""masterpiece"".<br/><br/>The story follows T'Challa aka the Black Panther, sometime after ""Captain America: Civil War"", finally taking the throne of his late father in the advanced hidden capital of Wakanda, an African country pretending to be a typical third world nation. When an old enemy pops up again, the new king finds himself face to face with a mysterious American mercenary with stirring obsession with Wakanda.<br/><br/>The story to ""Blank Panther"" is actually really good and goes a step above the usual in the MCU with plenty of emotional depth to its characters and not relying too much on previous films in the series. I will refrain from speaking on it to hold back spoilers. I will say that the story basically becomes the ""Lion King"". Nuff said.<br/><br/>Our hero is very likable and never does anything to break his status as a good role model. Chadwick Boseman created a fan favorite with Civil War and those qualities carry over here.<br/><br/>The villains are also above par, which for me has always been an issue with Marvel movies: a lot effort for the hero and the villain is just a one note baddy played by a high profile actor. Andy Serkis returns to replay his role of Klaue from ""Age of Ultron"", providing yet another over the top and energetic performance. His character isn't deep, but he knows how to chew the scenery. Yet again, this man proves he should have more roles, even outside motion capture. Then there is Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger. I won't spoil his character, but needless to say Jordan continues to show why he is one the new greats by providing an entertainingly defiant and yet emotionally involving villain. It's nice to actually have one that was an understandable reason for his behavior.<br/><br/>From the beauty of the advanced world of Wakanda to the superb soundtrack by Ludwig Goransson, the film provides a great blend of native African culture mixed with a futuristic cyberpunk style. The film is downright beautiful at times, especially during the spiritual ancestorial plain scenes. There is even a hint of James Bond through a scene where T'Challa is given a new suit and gadgets ala every Q scene ever. Boseman's charm helps with that vibe too.<br/><br/>As I said, the film is not a masterpiece. First off, while I do like the story over all, I do feel like there is was one story going on and the then another one just sorta starts halfway through. The film is pretty focused on Klaue until the halfway point where in which Killmonger suddenly just takes center stage. I found that little jarring. I guess Klaue was just a means to an end. I also found the fight scenes to be rather meh. The action itself is good with some great set-pieces such as cool chase scene in South Korea. I mainly mean the coverage of the one on one fights. They were just shot too close and cut too quick at times, making it hard to really appreciate the conflict. You just get the idea that people are beating down on each other. This is why I praise movies like ""John Wick"" or ""The Foreigner"" for actually covering visible fight scenes. I also found the final conflict at the end to be disappointing as it was ruined by some pretty meh CGI. It honestly looked like a 3D animated cartoon by the end. The CGI was actually iffy in some other areas too, and this late into the MCU that shouldn't be the case. It sorta looks like ""Gods of Egypt"" at times. (A guilty pleasure by the way) Also, some of the camera work as just headache inducing. One shot in particular where it starts upside down and spins around really just hurt my eyes. I get the idea: ""the situation has been turned upside down so let's literally shoot this in an unnerving way"". Ultimately, it just gave me a headache.<br/><br/>Despite these issues, I still think ""Black Panther"" is a solid entry in the Marvel cannon and I am excited to see more of Wakanda in the upcoming ""Infinity War"". I just feel some are making this sound better than it really is. It is really good movie, but not a great one. I feel perhaps it might be some the politics of the film that is raising it up to ""masterpiece"" level. I just don't care about that. I just care about whether it was a good movie or not. ""Black Panther"" was good. <br/><br/>Recommended."
"sharco-29009","6","0","3","19 May 2018"," I wanted to really Love Black Panther
","Perhaps I am one of the rare breeds who did not see the Movie, at the theatre that is. I don't like crowds. But I did buy the digital movie release of it with the Bonus content. First I will say I will always be proud of the Black Director, Black Producer and the Black Cast. Art, Television, Film, Theatre and Books have always been my first love. This is what I liked about the film. Beautiful Black People on screen from all over the globe. The love T'Challa has for his father, family and country. Some enchanting footage of T'Challa communicating with his deceased father. The portrayal of science, technology, engineering and math. Great costumes by Ruth Carter, great acting by Danai Gurira, Daniel Kaluuya, Winston Duke, and of course some great music.<br/><br/>Although I wanted to really Love Black Panther, it was a bit boring and just okay. In my opinion there was no stellar acting and no great moment in the film. I actually fell asleep on it a few times before I was actually able to watch the whole movie. T'Challa and Nakia had no chemistry exhibited on screen despite the scenes of T'Challa looking at Nakia adoringly or at least an attempt to portray adoringly. It fell flat. The so called jokes were not funny. Shuri playing jokes and laughing at her brother T'Challa were clearly meant to show the friendly sibling banter between brother and sister. I found the jokes mediocre at best. I've seen interviews where Chadwick Boseman explains the way he portrayed T'Challa based upon T'Challa's family background and how T'Challa would carry and conduct himself based on these things. I'll say I agree with his sentiment's. Boseman was chosen for the part and he brought to it what he thought was best. I've seen several of his other movies and the man definitely can act. I've also seen comments about Kilmonger portrayed by Michael B. Jordan being the hero and liked much better than T'Challa. After seeing the movie I can't say I agree with this as I found it to be a bit boring and just ok. I've also seen a few Michael B. Jordan interviews indicating what he did to prepare for the role of Kilmonger. Again Michael B Jordan was given the role of Kilmonger and portrayed him as he saw fit as an professional actor. A movie has so much that goes into constructing it, before, during and after it's made. In
this regard Black Panther is a Winner with stellar backing, support, and marketing. A box office success and I'm happy for them."

Also I found it a little offensive even though I'm not a African the Erik Killmonger (Michael B Jordan) said that Africans on the street have been suffering for years, but the people who actually live in Africa have been suffering for much longer, it didn't bother me that much but before a race or political statement really think about what your saying.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But really that was the only bad the rest was good Chadwick as Tchalla was great same with Michael B Jordan as Erik.

","I can see why the reviewers rate this movie low
Mostly because of the whole hype around, when you go to see the movie, you keep your expectations very high, and you end up being disappointed.(Happens in almost every movie)
I've most people complain about how predictable it was, but I tell you there is hardly any movie that you can't predict outcomes of certain situations.
Also on the acting, heard most people complain of the acting, that's basically caused by the accent (which I do like by the way)
Finally for the fighting scenes, the CGI was quite poor .

Eric (Killmonger) Stevens is a villain who we can empathize with while rooting for his demise. Nakia, T'Challa's Ex, shows that a fierce warrior can be compassionate and socially responsible.

","There is nothing entirely new about Black Panther compared to other super hero's movies. A sibling rivalry or a carbon copy villain are features from Green Lantern, the Hulk and X-men. So if you are looking for an entirely new take on the hero movie look elsewhere. If you are a fan of the MCU or the characters and comics it is based on than this movie is one of the best interactions in the universe so far. Black panther may focus on the life and struggles of King Techalla but the abundance of interesting and important supporting characters in this film is what makes it shine. While other films in the past have had interesting supporting rolls like captain americas squad of GI's or Thor's Lady skif and the warriors three, in these stories to me it always seemed like these characters were ether expendable or just not on the same level as the main character and the story could be completed without them. But in black panther the people of wakanda and the various tribal leaders are all quite important to the story and their interactions as well as the relationship between tchalla and his mother and sister add a depth to the film most superhero movies can't attain"
"ragpap93","7","0","2","12 May 2018"," I like it but I am aware that it is not flawless
","First the good:
1. It was very entertaining. Action, Fantasy and even comedy. The joke about the silent shoes, 'sneakers' get it. It cracked me up. There is a reason I mentioned it but that is for the bad.
A second joke I have to mention is: T'challa or Black panther ""froze like an antelope in the headlights"" when he went to fight his ex-girlfriend whom he still has feelings for. How true that is antelopes freezing in the headlights. Move you silly antelope out of the way scram. It gets annoying even.
2. A glimpse at the African culture but without mocking or glorifying it. It is almost neutral. Celebrations and jubilation everywhere. The accents was a nice touch though it has its pros and cons. Pro it is realistic, I mean you do not expect a Nigerian who lived in Nigeria to speak in an american accent even if it is a Hollywood movie.
3. The CGI was good unlike what other people tell you.
4. Rhinos in decorated armors. CGI I'm guessing.<br/><br/>The bad: 
1.The goof about the shoes for silent shoes they surely made noise for later in the film, T'challa runs up a ramp wearing the sneakers and you could hear his footsteps.
2. The con to accents is stereotypes.
3. The conversation about using the Wakandan technology to help other nations was an idea shoved aside with some silly counterpoints about the tech going to the wrong hands. Yet they use the tech to save a 'white boy'. He is British. You are not fooling anybody Martin Freeman you are not American. Bragging about saving somebody is fine until you bring race into it. Even if it is a black person saying I'm going to save the 'white by'. The only reason we have the Everett K. Ross character is so that people cannot accuse a movie for 'black-washing'. Neither 'white-washing' or 'black-washing' is fair but neither is diversity hire because it does not seem to be about talent but the color of the skin. <br/><br/>Things that fall somewhere in the middle:
1. However regarding the Wakandan tech they decide to reveal it which you would have found out had you stayed for the credits. Leaving a Marvel movie without watching the credits who is going to make that mistake again. ""What can a nation of farmers offer the rest of the world?"" some UN official asks condescendingly and the Wakandan's smirk. It is kind of silly but funny as well. 
2. Also in the credits there is a hint of Infinity War Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier appears. It would have been better if Black Panther was a stand-alone film but maybe less people would have watched it then. Who knows.
3. The Marvel franchise pitfalls plague this movie as well with its very typical story lines and I do not know what to think of it. Lately though some movies are breaking out of that (Thor Agnarok )so there is still hope yet."

Far from bad, just not up there. 6/10 is about right: worth watching, but don't pick it over anything interesting.<br/><br/>I do like one decision, which is to make the black characters, ""good"" and ""bad"", super racist.<br/><br/>They make the evil South African look racially tolerant and benevolent, and the CAA operative look positively angelic (although being Martin Freeman with an American accent, a bit odd). This is an essential idea for the mythos and plot. The Wakandans are racist against tribes from other nations in the region, who they refuse to help, and a little bit racist towards the fifth Wakandan tribe; the opponents are racist in thinking Wakanda should help black Americans just because they, too are black.<br/><br/>No side is very sympathetic therefore, which makes for an interesting plot and a film in which you invest in individual characters, not in ""sides"" because the sides (of which there are three) are all based on different bigotries"

","Black panther is a unique movie. It had the potential to be a hard leftist black power movie and it is refreshing and inspiring that it did not take that approach and instead gave us a story about black people becoming empowered not through violence and hatred but through peace and sharing culture. The politics are not shoved down your throat. Simply existing in the plot is not force feeding. The politics are integral to telling this story correctly in order to make black panther a great hero and role model for the black community. The performances are all great and anything but wooden. After watching tommy wiseau ""act"" one will never complain about performances ever again. Eric killmonger is a great villain and is very sympathetic and likeable and chadwick boseman plays a stoic yet noble black panther who we grow to care about through the narrative. Shuri was quite funny and reminded me of my own sister. Humor is subjective and some of the jokes definitely Wont land for everyone but that's the nature of comedy. Nothing on this planet is universally funny. I fail to understand where all the 1 star reviews come from. Is it overrated? Perhaps a little bit but this is nowhere near the level of batman and Robin or the dreaded catwoman movie. The narrative is a little bit derivative but killmonger's story makes it quite enjoyable. Is it the best marvel movie? Probably not but it's certainly far from the worst."

"stefhavermans","4","0","1","5 May 2018"," Well this was horrible
","After all the hype, I've finally managed to view a title I've put off for a long time for several reason. Those reasons being me fearing the movie would be a big cliché and an overhyped piece of Marvel fanboying. After watching the movie, I feel sad I actually gave it a chance.<br/><br/>The whole plot of the movie is paperthin and feels like it's been based on a children's movie or Disney's Lion King gone live action. Introduction of the movie feels sloppy, as some people get a lot of camera action and backstory and others don't. After a good 10 minutes of the movie, you kind have realised how the story is going to turn out. You can recognize the bad guy, you can imagine the story and you can tell importance of persons in the story just from the lines they get. <br/><br/>The overall cohesion of the movie is very low. CGI doesn't look all too good and forced. The dialogues are terrible and could've been written by a 10 year old and all the clichés that can occur in a superhero movie do occur. (Spoilers) The superhero gets chosen but is uncertain of himself. He get's defeated and learns he isn't the best but is still better than injustice. He stands up and defeats the bad guy. Wow, this is a plot we've never seen before Marvel. Just because you happen to put black people in it and a bad interpretation of African culture, this movie doesn't distinguish itself. This movie doesn't even cover a lot of black culture. It just has black actors speaking horrible English, saying cliche lines and living up to African stereotypes. <br/><br/>The overall sound mixing of the movie is also terrible. I kind of like Kendrick, but all of the sounds in this music consist of this one beat of a Kendrick track being played over and over, which I thought was pretty weak. There are a lot of other black rappers, musicians who could've been useful and maybe given this a real African vibe, instead of a (cliché) American one. <br/><br/>To conclude, this movie just was exactly the disappointing pile of crap I expected. The story did not suprise/impress me at any point, nor did the visuals or the composition of the movie. If you love the superhero genre, you might like this movie but I certainly did not. For me it was just a story heard many times before, given a bad African vibe by some Hollywood people who wanted to make a movie that would be political correct without taking to much actual diversity on hand; trying to please the big crowd as much as they could with a storyline a child could follow and replay at school. I sure hope Infinity war is beter."

","The fake African nation of Wakanda is the main setting for the film Black Panther. As the movie is full of riveting action scenes and witty quips, there was a question that had me wondering after the movie. That question being, ""What is Wakanda?"" Is this fake nation one that remains in a pre-modern mindset, or is it a modern nation? Perhaps it is even post-modern or beyond?<br/><br/>Personally, throughout a bulk of the film I would say Wakanda is a pre-modern nation with incredible technology. It is a nation that focuses tremendously on tradition and relies solely on the decision's of its king. However, at the end of the film something changes.<br/><br/>T'Challa (the Black Panther and king of Wakanda) moves towards making Wakanda a nation that no longer bases itself on past tradition, but rather towards helping those in need. In other words, T'Challa is moving beyond tradition to do what believes is right. Why? Because there is a view of superiority that Wakanda has (and rightfully so) compared to the rest of the world. It seems as if this nation has made the jump to modernity with this change of view from its leadership. <br/><br/>What are your thoughts? Is Wakanda a pre-modern, modern, or post-modern nation? Did the nation change its views at all from the beginning to the end of the film?"

Tho i was mostly right about my feeling i underestimated the movie, it was very entertaining and good acting.<br/><br/>The black 'vibe' can be felth from start to finish.<br/><br/>Plot : The plot is again a bit boring and typical realy, we have a boy whos father got killed by the hand of (previous) King of Wakanda.. many years later that boy -Grown up by now - arrives in Wakanda to rise as king of wakanda *SPOILER* by killing our new king (The black panther) in a ceremonial fight.. Or so we think, ofcourse he is not dead.<br/><br/>After beeing revived and going back to Wakanda and killing the bad guy they save Wakanda and therefore the entire world...

","Yes I know I'm just supposed to do only Made in Naija movie reviews, but I can't help it in this one! Besides, there was enough reference to Nigeria in this movie, so here we are! I saw the most hyped movie of this time, Black Panther, and I loved it! There is actually nothing to hate in this movie! I am not really a fan of science fiction and fantasy movies, I mean, I love the X-Men franchise, but that does not mean that I jump to the cinema as soon as they release a new movie every week.<br/><br/>But Black Panther is different! It is obvious that these people sat down and did their homework well. I mean, I did not find any fault with the movie! And that is the best thing about the movie. It was like the creators of the movie were ready for any movie critic; they left no stone unturned. Beautiful working storyline, amazing location (and if it was a studio work, the special effects team deserve an Oscar), lovely, lovely costumes! (I mean, Lupita actually wore Ankara!), the soundtrack too cannot be compared to another, especially during the fighting scenes. And they did not use the same score for two fights. One score, one fight. (Yes I pay so much attention to details) I mean, Marvel outdid themselves in this one!<br/><br/>This is a good place to stop right? Before I will start sounding like a sell out. But there is no movie without characters right? We have to talk about them! TChalla, the king of Wakanda and the Black Panther himself brought his A game to this one! He commanded so much screen presence that I just wanted to see him in all scenes. That said. Michael Jordan is one very sexy villain I have not seen in a very long time! I mean, the first time he appeared on screen, he was stealing. But every girl at the cinema screamed when he appeared. Yes! I heard them. Other cast members are Lupita as Nakia, the object of the king's affection, Angela Basset as Queen Mother Ramonda, Forrest Whittaker as the king's spy. But the character that brought life to Wakanda is bald headed Okoye, the king's general. Played by new comer Danai Gurira. Girl's got some badass moves when fighting!<br/><br/>Yes! Black Panther is the most hyped movie of this time; but the movie is worth all the hype. It has something for everybody - scifi, drama, African heritage, basketball, comedy, ceremonies, action, gun fight, etc. But a little lacking in the romance department. I did not mind a bit though...<br/><br/>If you have not watched it, please go and watch it. Not for anything; just to feel among we cool kids that have watched the movie and to tell people that you have also watched what is perhaps the greatest movie in 2018."

","Let me start off by saying I'm not a huge fan of Marvel movies. Most times to me they are hit or miss, they can be well made and entertaining (Guardians of The Galaxy/Iron Man) or completely shallow and boring with a terrible plot and poor dialogue (The Avengers). When comparing Black Panther to other Marvel Films it is an amazing movie and easily in my top 5 for Marvel, but when judging it as a stand alone film I'd say it's a good, but not great movie. The plot was engaging, the visuals were pleasing and it was well acted (over all). I would say it was about 20 min too long and felt like some scenes dragged on forever. My final take away would be that it is a well made, entertaining film that was slightly too long... it was one of the 1st if not 1st Major Blockbuster with a majority Black cast and crew which will make it a historic film. Whether or not it will be a classic film only time will tell, but like most Marvel films I'm guessing it will not."

","It is in fact the best action movie shown lately in the big screen, really worth watching, amazing quality, with fantastic acting and very good directing job, congratulations Mr. Ryan Coogler. 
If we could go back in time I would just recommend trying to take a real acting from the main villain Michael B. Jordan, because he's acting is quite poor, he moves like a ""moving head dog for car"", and he forces acting instead of feeling his role, lines and reacting to what's around (just watch the trailer of ""Creed"" and he's acting didn't changed much, he's the same in both, just with different lines. His last scene becomes so lame, embarrassing and unbearable to watch, he just forces a crying scene, feeling pity for himself. Sorry to point this out but if it wasn't for this I would rate it with 9 or 10 stars.<br/><br/>Chadwick Boseman performance is perfect, he is the ideal king, humble, full of determination, focused, relaxed, eyes wide open, protective, caring for those around, trustworthy, concern, decisive, straight to the point, a truly hero, a fighter and a shield of the true values. All this qualification is what I see without lines, just expression, just acting quality, he shows all that by simply being, by his presence.
All characters were simply fantastic doing their perfect job delivering their best performance.
Personally I love the accent, it brings a lot of quality to the entire movie, gives also more moments of comedy and laughter. 
All rituals mixed with a more modern dynamic gives a cool lifting atmosphere. The cool greet it's perfect for the film, the kingdom sort of rigid and full of rules becomes soft, happy and lighter.
The idea of giving Winston Duke as M'baku and his boys the sound of dogs it's just brilliant, very original, funny at the same time. His character gives some good nice laughter also, because he's very relaxed and very into his role."

","Spielberg at his best;
I really enjoyed this escape from reality and the homage to so many movies and cultural icons Steven Spielberg has managed to cram into this game within a game movie.
A few weeks ago I reviewed another virtual reality movie a (rom com) Game Night , which I really loathed and thought absolute crap so I was a little sceptical about Ready Player One.
Last Sunday we visited our neighbours very switched on and clever Grandson Callum for his 9th birthday celebration and he was engrossed in his new video game with head set in place and I could see it had captured his imagination and I spotted his Avatar or virtual reality identity in full destroyer battle mode.
I wish now I'd taken up his invitation to join in the game as I've never played a video game but there's always next time.
This experience unknowingly prepared me for this movie in which has cleverly combined real actors , who live in a bleak futuristic 2045 in dismal residential towers called ""The Stacks"".
The occupants of this dark and shattered world escape to the Oasis a virtual realty world where fantasy is the aim and adventure is the game.
Some have said this may be Spielberg 's greatest movie I'm not sure about that sweeping statement but it's up there with ET and Close Encounters.
A terrific youthful cast headed by Tye Sheridan as Parzival, our hero and Olivia Cooke as his capable side kick and romantic interest are the young game players but I was also impressed by the villain Australia 's Ben Mendelsohn as Sorrento and Mark Rylance as Anorak and the inventor of the Oasis James Halliday.
Also loved the music and the fact that what could seem a bleak future Spielberg has transformed into a spectacular colourful world where the human element is most the important component.
It's more about friendship , loyalty and caring for your fellow humans and reality really wins out in the end.
A High Five ! and I'll add 4 to score this movie a 9."

"aspamir","7","0","1","22 April 2018"," Satisfying, yet Hollywood
","The Black Panther (2018) is a film about superheroes. Whether it is different from other American films in the genre in terms of plot and tropes? I am not sure. In fact, it is full of clichÃ©s. I expected that the creators' will revert the Eurocentric worldview and the resulting power hierarchy, which it fails to do. Nevertheless, it was a pleasant experience to see positive and strong black heroes. In a generation that we all come to associate superheroes, from Jesus to Superman and Wonderwoman with white people, this is a big deal. The allows to imagine a world in which Europe or America is not seen as almost a divinely ordained centre of the world and the avant-garde of human civilization. Indirectly, it hints that all the races came from Africa, that Africa is actually the locomotive of human civilisation in historical retrospect. <br/><br/>The film is, on another level, a brutal, yet superficial criticism of Euro-American imperialism, with all its nasty components from heritage stealing and colonising to coup-manufacturing and invasions. In an ironic fantasy world, the young King of Wakanda is fighting to death to prevent the distribution of state of art arms and technology to the world? Does anyone see the parallel? Yes, America is the biggest arm-dealer of the world with the most advanced military technology. <br/><br/>Besides falling into the tropes of Western motives, such as seeking the treasure, having a CIA guy always onsite and so on, I think the film does a good job to make us think and critic the Eurocentric worldview and decolonise our minds. Of course, one has to understand the struggle of the Black Americans and centuries long racism and discrimination to understand the film. Watching the film, I recall being in the Museum of African-American Heritage in Washington DC with my black friend from Malawi, where I was feeling joy and anger at the same time. <br/><br/>All in all the film failed me. I was hoping that the script writers and directors will bring the American revolutionary cousin (Killmonger) to unite the Wakandans, to ridicule the CIA guy and perhaps kick him out of Wakanda. Alas not. He is there to be demonised. Why are they portraying a CIA guy as an almost innocent lunatic with a baby-face? And a black revolutionary as a gangster and ultimately a monster who is there to destroy the world and disrupt the peace that the CIA is so eager to preserve? And, yes, Killmonger is right to ask: why the technologically advanced Wakandans are doing nothing for other people including Africans who suffer from poverty, instead they are content in their comfortable fantasy world.? It is not a caricature of the modern world. It is painfully realistic. The gap between rich and poor countries and rich and poor individuals has never been so greater, yet our Hollywood superhero is doing nothing to that end. He is happy with the state of affairs. He failed us just as Barack Obama failed every one of us sucking up to the power structure, doing nothing to stop American imperialism and overseas warfare."

","THE BLACK PANTHER
My late review<br/><br/>I finally saw the movie. I must admit a speculative fiction movie is just not my first choice in movies. After seeing ""Furious 7,"" I promised myself I wouldn't waste my valuable time again. I also admit that my only intentions for seeing the movie was to support this movie because it's based on Afro American History. Although the movie is fiction much of the story is true. I suspect many other people saw the movie for the same reason. It is a great movie. <br/><br/>The movie kept a fast action packed tempo that was easy to follow from beginning to end. There were several A Listed Actors that played their parts to perfection. Whoever chose the cast couldn't have done a better job. Angela Basett, Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jorden, Forrest Whitaker; those names sell movie tickets! I have never saw a more beautiful cast of actors. I'm sure the actors hard bodies were a marketing factor. Their skin was smooth, chocolate, shinny, and even toned. After the movie I had the craving for a Hershey Bar; yes, that good. <br/><br/>Although the entire film wasn't shot in Africa the locations were nothing short of paradise. The use of animated animals was risky but also well done. <br/><br/>I kept thinking, there is no way this movie was written by one person. There was just soooo much going on. The brilliant writers Ryan Coogler, Joe Robert Cole, and Jack Kirby tied the conclusion of the story in to the opening scene perfectly. <br/><br/>The time jump from summer to winter wasn't clear to me. I don't even think the change of seasons was necessary. I think they could have used a better substance for snow. One thing that really stuck out for me was the way one character died in the end of the movie. I don't think the actor acted out a dying man well. I think it took way to long for the character to die. I have to charge the actor and the director for that. <br/><br/>This movie is very educational. It is not your typical super hero movie. I have strong doubt that you will be disappointed. I highly recommend this movie. GO SEE THE MOVIE!<br/><br/>Peace and Blessings<br/><br/>Erik Smalls

Failed attempt of making puns, and even moments of seriousness and the emotional scenes involved such stupid dialogues that the audience in the theater laughed at it instead.
You can either make Superhero movies which really touch you emotionally and focus on making a good film, that'll last with the viewers for years, be it The Dark Knight, Captain America: The Winter Soldier or Logan. Or you can make movies that involve great action and on point puns, that'll be forgotten soon, but those movies are good nonetheless, like Deadpool, Thor: Ragnarok. Those movies will be forgotten fast, but definitely run in the cinemas longer than any other ones. Combining the two is a difficult task, making a movie that satisfies the needs of an audience that critically watches movies and actually considers the actors real, for those two hours, and don't just go to the cinema to stuff their faces with popcorn while watching a fight between the cliched protagonist and the antagonist, be it as unreal as it may.<br/><br/>They've tried to combine those two categories of film making and have failed miserably. I don't care whether it grossed out at 1.3billion or whatever. The point is remains that it's a bad movie. An unfinished movie. Immature acting, Cringe worthy dialogues and bad directing.

The music played out the same way the action sequences did. Most of the action felt choppy and failed to impress, with one fight between T'Challa and Killmonger being great. It was as if inside the passable action were flashes of greater action scenes that could've been something else. In the same scenes opposing the flashes of greatness, were flashes of rubbery and pixely CGI, that took you out of the scene momentarily. This is all present especially during the final fight. Which looks like it was conceived after a double feature of Tron: Legacy and The Phantom Menace. What it fails to do on an action movie approach, it makes up for in characters and story... With the exception of one thin character played by Daniel Kuluuya. T'Challa is a stoic protagonist, who basically has the same character arc as Thor in Thor: Ragnorok, but he works fine, just like the rest of his family. The only place this movie greatly succeeds in, is the villains. Killmonger and Klaue are a refreshing duo of menace and menacing comedy that doesn't ruin the tension like in other Marvel movies. Ulysses Klaue is funny and has a very unsettling puffy robot hand which is an interesting little tool. Killmonger is a tank with a new compelling background and motivation that continues to impress, up until his very last lines, which are great. He rips through every level of Wakanda seemingly effortlessly, which makes him probably the most badass villain in the marvel universe, even though his endgame is bit overdone. Him and T'Challa are caught in a feud for the throne of Wakanda that develops an interesting story, that comes with a few surprises and twists. Although it does go on for a bit too long. Overall, I liked this movie. It's not great nor is it bad. It's successes beat out it's failures just enough to make it an enjoyable movie. So I give it a 7.1"

","If you are going to watch a Marvel movie, you know you are not going in for THE cinematic experience of the year or an intelligent, clever plot. To put it simply, Marvel is entertainment.<br/><br/>Thor: Ragnarok was a delight. The director Waititi (""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" and ""What we do in the shadows"") played a huge role in that, personally I just love his sense of humour. Even if you don't enjoy that quirkiness - it was still a good story, good dialogues and a visual eye-candy.<br/><br/>Somehow it is 7.9, while this movie is 7.8. 
How did that happen?<br/><br/>Black Panther is stale nonsense. The dialogues are horrific, the acting not worth mentioning and as for the characters...I didn't care about a single one. 
The storyline entirely predictable, the ""big bang"" in the end a joke. 
The movie tries to be cool (Constant Hip hop beats, flying an airship in yoga position) and utterly fails in that respect."

"charbelelaro","6","0","3","4 April 2018"," So predictable that the adrenaline never kicked in
","Black Panther directed by Ryan Coogler is Marvel's latest film, and is marketed as being a unique take on the cinematic universe. And to a certain extent it is, in terms of setting and characters. But ultimately the action set pieces and story structure is basically exactly what we would expect. Black Panther sadly has many issues in my opinion. Firstly the pacing is slow and ultimately boring. The endless expository dialogue cannot be justified as something that is necessary for character development. In fact the characters were my second major issue. Killmonger's revenge story doesn't even pick up until halfway through the film. Yes they gave him a back story, but it's so basic I could describe it all in a sentence. His lack of development made it really hard to care in crucial moments, such as the climatic battle which didn't feel climatic due to the lack of emotional attachment I had to the characters. I never felt an authentic connection to the story because all we are given for our villain were forced emotional flashbacks. Furthermore, for a film with a $200 million budget the level of CGI was pretty unacceptable. It wasn't unbearable, but for the most part every CGI aspect was noticeably CGI. The animated scenery of Wakanda didn't blow me away in the slightest. The comedy in the film was so weak. Every joke was completely out of place. The film seemed scared to let scenes build in intensity. We didn't need a dumb joke about vegetarians to mess up the tone. Another issue was the lack of suspense and anticipation I felt throughout the entire runtime. Any life threatening scene for T'Challa became incredibly dull with zero emotional impact simply because I had just seen him in the Avenger's trailer literally right before the movie started. All in all, Black Panther is a perfectly enjoyable action film and I'm glad so many people felt satisfied by it. The movie presents such important ideas surrounding social justice and racial equality, although putting that aside and looking at the film I was very disappointed. By the end it was so predictable that the adrenaline never kicked in. So therefore I give Black Panther a"

","Archie (WhatsApp friend ;)) is very serious about films. Besides Bob, she is my other source of information on the latest movie releases. My movie plans revolve around Archie's seasoned critique. She is the 'recommender of movies', 'maker of plans' and 'booker of tickets' (sometimes gets the theatre wrong but you can't hold that against the Maker) and despite all this, I went ahead and watched the Black Panther even when Archie said that the movie was just average. Could she be wrong? The movie has been setting milestones and is apparently the highest grossing superhero movie.
Though I like the DC comic superheroes better, I prefer watching the Marvel movies. So when Shugz and Hershey asked me if I wanted to watch the movie, I tagged along. 
30 minutes into the movie, I looked at Hershey who looked super engrossed. I waited for 5 more minutes and then hesitatingly asked her if she could understand what was happening. ""Not a clue (or should I say Klaue :D)""she said. 
(NO SPOILERS) Here is the storyline of the movie (I shall refrain from calling it the Plot because the movie lacks one!): The film begins with the 'birth' (figuratively) of the Black Panther and the coming together of the Jabari Tribe to form 'Wakanda'- a nation that portrays itself as a Third World Country to the world, that irrationally refuses foreign aid but is in fact years ahead of its counterparts in technology and refrains from aiding other countries despite having the capacity to do so. 
The source of this technological advancement is Vibranium, a metal available exclusively in Wakanda, that is used in almost everything - fidget spinner like flying saucer, kinetic energy absorbing 'panthersuit', running trains to healing broken vertebrae and turning otherwise gentle rhinos to beasts of war. 
The vibranium falls into the wrong hands, an illegal arms-dealer, Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and King T'Chaka's brother (Sterling Brown) is accused of having helped him steal it. 
Post T'Chaka's death, his son T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) inherits the throne. He is accompanied by his side-kicks, Okoye (Danai Gurira), the leader of his army of bodyguards and his ex-lover, Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o)
Klaue steals a Wakandan artefact made of Vibranium from a museum with help from Erik Stevens (Michael Jordan) and plans on selling it to a CIA operative, Everett Ross (Martin Freeman). T'Challa along with Okoye and Nakia head to South Korea to extract the Vibranium before it's sold and also bring back Klaue to Wakanda for justice. The plan goes awry with Klaue escaping, only to be killed later by Erik Stevens.
Erik goes to Wakanda with Klaue's corpse and gains the support of a tribe there and defeats T'Challa in the ritualistic fight for the throne. Skipping the why's and the how's as that would reveal the ""plot"" (for lack of a better word), the story follows with attempts made to restore the rightful heir to the throne. 
Here is why I was disappointed with the movie:
1. Did you see Forest Whitaker mentioned in the storyline above? Well, guess what, he's there in the movie. The movie has an ensemble of brilliant actors but unfortunately they either lack sufficient screen time (Brown and Whitaker) or they aren't ideally suited for the characters being portrayed by them (Freeman and Nyong'o).
2. Many may disagree but Boseman hasn't done complete justice to the role of Black Panther. The character just seems so 'ordinary', there are no quirks that set him apart. 
3. The movie is a hotchpotch of plots. The story seems to have been written along the way, in an attempt to include all that is required to make a Blockbuster Superhero film and then some more.
4. While the actor (Jordan) portraying the role of the villain has made a good attempt, the character of the villain itself is not well-etched. All superhero movies need a Super Villain and Eric Stevens is not intimidating enough. 
5. The dialogues lack in creative ingenuity.
The only time the audience hooted was when Stan Lee made his cameo appearance. 
Thankfully I hear it's a non-sequel movie. It goes to show that the makers of the film too didn't have much confidence in it."

Directing was OK and the production values were good.<br/><br/>The not so good:<br/><br/>There were some slow spots in this one...lots of them. Unlike most Marvel movies, this one seems to lack much of any sense of humor. I understand they are doing an origin story with the first film for BP...they spent way too much time on it. This may have worked well were this a stronger story, not so much here. Not to give too much away if you haven't seen it, entitled rich prince becomes king(and superhero), loses kingship then gains it back(along with powers and a suit), because he is...you know...entitled.<br/><br/>Considering the time they spent developing this story I would expect that there would have been much more character development, but in this case it was sorely lacking. The ""villain"" is the most developed character in the film and ultimately the most likable having at least a motivation. The titular hero of the movie, aside from having been born the son of an absolute monarch, chowing down on the African equivalent of peyote, is not(in my opinion) well developed, relatable or especially likable. Other characters are 2D, but honestly still more likable than our hero.<br/><br/>I wish I had skipped the big screen and waited for Netflix."

Stories of all colors and stripes are waiting to be told, and cinema fans are pining for fresh takes and innovative ways to convey those tales.<br/><br/>However--one way or the other--box office results should never be mistaken for a barometer of a film's quality.

 I particularly like their bad-ass female version of the Praetorian guard.

","It almost goes without saying with most superhero movies coming out as of late that if you go into it expecting the next Citizen Kane or 12 Angry Men, you'll be disappointed. However with Black Panther if you go into it looking for a fun, energetic action romp you likely will not leave disappointed.<br/><br/>If you follow the logic of ""a movie is only as good as it's villain"" as many do, I think you'll be quite pleased with Michael B. Jordan and his portrayal of Killmonger. He truly seems as though he invested himself into the character and it might be one of the best performances he's given throughout his career so far. He had believable motives, intriguing development and the story took turns with his character that caught me by surprise.<br/><br/>While Chadwick Boseman pails in comparison to Michael B. Jordan, his performance is certainly nothing to shake a stick at. He gives about the best performance he can since his character dialogue has a lot of monotone, stern delivery as you would expect from a superhero we are supposed to expect a leadership figure from. <br/><br/>Talking about the story, some may find it predictable as it is definitely possible to draw a lot of similarities to past stories like The Lion King, but I think that there is still turns that plenty of the audience won't see coming.<br/><br/>Going to the visuals, I would consider them absolutely stunning. Wakanda is a beautiful place and the production team brought it to life with ease. We are taken through a few different set pieces that kept the film flowing and has no trouble maintaining your attention.<br/><br/>A couple of my biggest gripes would be that some characters that we are lead to believe carry an important weight to the story are inexplicably absent for a large portion of the movie, which did leave me wondering for a couple portions of the film. Another is the way some scenes are lit or just too dark to see anything, unfortunately. Something I noticed but it didn't impede my viewing experience too much to make a bigger complaint of. <br/><br/>All in all, I recommend checking this one out if you're a superhero movie fan, but if you despise superhero movies and are sick of seeing them come out, this one probably won't change your mind."

","Killmonger's political idea is very naïve and T'Challa doesn't know how to refute that. <br/><br/>Wakanda just signed SOKOVIA ACCORD weeks ago to restrict Avengers from ignoring other countries' border and flipping their wills fighting around. The old king T'Chaka even said: ""Our people's blood is spilled on foreign soil. Not only because of the actions of criminals, but by the indifference of those pledge to stop them. Victory at the expense of the innocent, is no victory at all."" BUT, when it comes to Black Panther, he just invaded Korean territorial air space, ignored international law, local law and collateral damage. Wow, I mean, Wakanda is more America even than America.<br/><br/>As a country with that kind of top notch high tech and special computer technology, their streets still look like Mumbai in India, or Sakaar planet in Thor 3. Most of people walk on the dusty soil road with bare feet.If a country is really that advanced, it should be shown in every aspects, including common people's life.<br/><br/>Also, the political system in Wakanda is extremely fragile and dangerous. There is no proper mechanism to restrict king's power, and the selecting system is unbearably primitive.

"gortx","Null","0","1","11 March 2018"," Solid Superhero origin story
","Setting aside what it represents for the moment, let's just say that Ryan Coogler's BLACK PANTHER is a good solid superhero movie. Just like WONDER WOMAN last year, that should be first and foremost the most important thing to consider.<br/><br/>What sets PANTHER apart from most superhero origin movies is that it is largely content with 'just' being an origin story. Ever since SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE set the template, most first movies in a franchise begin with the background tale in the first half, and then proceed to the title character's first adventure. Save for a brief epilogue (and the now de rigeur Marvel credits sequence bits (two, here)), PANTHER ends with Chadwick Boseman's T'Chala fully earning the right to his moniker. No second act.<br/><br/>For the most part, the strategy works. Writer-Director Coogler and co-writer Joe Robert Cole have concocted an original enough tale (based on the works of Jack Kirby and a cameo-ing Stan Lee, of course) to keep this a backstory-only adventure. Even though there is a bit of sci-fi to spark the story (a meteorite with a magic metal substance called vibranium), this plays out almost like a tribal sword and sandal tale full of magic kingdoms (Wakanda) and god-like leaders. And, of course, there are the usual warring factions. Bringing the legend to the present day involves a seemingly unrelated theft of a Wakandan weapon in a British museum. The robbery is carried off by a cheeky villain named Klaue (Andy Serkis) and Killmonger (Coogler fave Michael B. Jordan). Getting the weapon back involves international intrigue which includes the involvement of an American spy Ross (Martin Freeman). Family secrets are revealed, battles fought including double-crosses before all is settled.<br/><br/>The spins on the usual origin story work for the most part, although there are some points where the pacing sags, and the story-line gets a bit murky. Placing the ancient Wakanda in the context of the modern world gets a bit awkward at times with some cringe-worthy dialogue and even a character flipping the bird. It's not that some of these intrusions of modernism wouldn't intrude on their world, but, it's sometimes an uneasy mix with all the somber respect for past rituals and a certain reverence to mysticism. The acting is solid with stalwarts like Angela Bassett and Forrest Whitaker on hand to add gravitas. The production design and special effects work are solid with some intriguing twists in keeping with the story's more offbeat themes. The music isn't bad, but, one thing the D.C. films have over the Marvel universe are the scores. It's as Marvel purposely doesn't want the soundtracks to compete with their 'vision'.<br/><br/>BLACK PANTHER's success - both critical and commercial - is worth noting. Even more so, because the actual movie earns that respect. And, the sight of the all those warrior kings and, especially, queens is sight to behold on the big screen."

Chadwick and Michael give us really good performances here, the themes underlying in the plot, and the CGI looked good (most of the time).<br/><br/>In my opinion, you don't need to watch this movies to watch Infinity War.

"AritonM","6","0","1","10 March 2018"," Decent movie, should've been better
","When you see the Marvel comic flipping through to start a movie, you get ready for a beast movie. Black Panther did not reach that level. The movie was very slow for a large part of it. They tried to give a lot of background and that's fine, but the problem was they ended up rushing through the good part of the movie because they spent too much time on pointless stuff. <br/><br/>You have a nation that was ruled by generations of Kings from the same family this is great. So all the future kings grow up in the same nation. Wakanda is a very advanced, happy nation. The old king dies and the new king fights for his right to the throne against the one challenger and wins. <br/><br/>Now the story completely gets turned upside down in what feels like 5 minutes. A young man shows up with a dead body of the man he killed in a bag, with an old sob story, a lip tattoo that is basically a passport that he could've used anytime in his life to get to wakanda, but chose to be a world wide killer instead and then shows up one day and basically becomes the new king in 1 day and launches the country in a civil war. Let's go through those again: a perfect society, a new king everyone knew and loved his entire life, gets removed in 1 day by some kid from Compton and the new king is respected and fought for even when the other king people thought was dead was still alive and never conceded. So they just threw out their laws to follow a new guy who just got there yesterday who was gonna lead them into world war and probably ruin their utopian society. <br/><br/>I think the better story, which we've seen a thousand times (Thor for example), would have been two brothers who grew up in the same nation fighting for the crown or even extended Klaw's role in the story and made him the main villain who acquired vibranium and found a way to conquer Wakanda and expel the real king only to have the real king come back and destroy him. That would've made much more sense. <br/><br/>The story they had for this movie just didn't hold water. Could've been so much better."

Jordan who played one of the best villain in superhero movies ever; his motivations are so compelling that make you sympathy with him. The dramatic moments were touching and they are clearly inspired by The Lion King. Unfortunately, the action scenes are very very bad especially with the use of such poor CGI; the characters seemed as they were fully animated in some kind of a computer game. The major issue I have with this movie is the ending; it's so rushed and clichéd. I think the movie should have been separated into two parts because it ends weirdly, I feel that the ending came out of nowhere; it's very displaced. I hoped to see King T'Challa more stronger as he was in Civil War but they made all the women in the movie stupidly strong that their fight scenes overshadowed Black Panther's. Overall, I had so much fun watching this movie but I think it's so overrated."

","Black Panther ***<br/><br/>Black Panther hits the big screen as another of the Marvel Universe characters get the big blockbuster treatment.<br/><br/>There's a Shakespearean power struggle for the crown of the Black Panther and the future of the secret technological advanced empire Wakanda.<br/><br/>There's a nice sense of maturity to the film in it's theme establishing the conflicts between family, friends, foes and outside forces as betrayal is rife.<br/><br/>The good news is the film is a big solid hit. It provides all the thrills, excitement and most importantly the quality that marvels seems to assure its films get.<br/><br/>Stand out performances really come from the villains in this film with a energetic Andy Serkis keeping it fun whilst Michael Jordan capitalizes on a generous character ark to fledge out a villain on multiple levels of emotion.<br/><br/>In the scheme of things how does it land in the Marvel Universe well it's less funnier than Thor 3, less demanding than Civil War, better than Age of Ultron and better plotted than Guardians 2.<br/><br/>Yes it's becoming a complicated old universe but all in all Black Panther holds it's own establishing another strong Marvel Character."
"jurdeurloo","7","0","4","5 March 2018"," Solid movie with some flaws.
","I found this a solid movie really enjoyed it but it some flaws. The story was thin it was pretty predictable like thr scene where killmonger throws black panther from the waterfall he could have easilly stabbed him to death but by throwing him of the waterfall they could make him land good so he could survive. but its a superhero movie so one of the main reasons i go and see them is for their action. Its not every scene in the movie is predictable though, take the moment when the first villain dies. If you hadn't seen any trailers and are new to this hero this would come as a big surprise i really liked that. The cgi was not that great but al those people said that it sucked are just searching for flaws because it was good most of the time, in the final fight the cgi was a bit hindering for me but in the rest of the movie didn't bother me at all. i get that a movie about an african civilization should have african people but why are they wearing acient clothes? I don't get that but maybe thats only bothering me. Also one scene was one of the most racist scenes i have ever seen in a modern movie why are they making monkey noises when the cia agent starts speaking i don't know if it is racist to white people or racist to black people but i think its racist. I don't like all the pollitcal influence around the movie it doesn't have anything to do with the movie it self so i don't give this any influence to the grade but why do people give this movie praise for being with only black actors it shouldn't make a difference if a movie is played by a white guy/woman or by a black guy/women. I don't think you can grade a movie on the political corectness take a movie like wonderwoman this movie gets compared to black panther although they have a completelly different story but why do they get compared because they stand out in their politcal influence the one is about woman and their opression and the other one about black people and their opression in pollitcal terms. why should you compare a movie because of that i don't get it and i think its wrong. But over all if i judge the movie alone its prettt solid but has his flaws."
"ethanburnsqe","7","0","3","5 March 2018"," Definitely not the best marvel movie
","When I came into this movie I had really low expectations, which is probably why I'm giving it a 7 out of 10. Everyone else had high expectations and were disappointed, so it makes sense that they are rating it so low. But honestly if the hype hadn't been there it probably would have gotten reviews similar to mine. Instead, the reviews seem to be a mix of 1 star ratings from disappointed viewers and 10 star ratings from people who like it just cause there's a mostly African cast in it.
This movie is nothing special plot wise really. It doesn't really feel believable, and the conflict was highly unnecessary. The main baddie was arrogant and angry to a point of being also not really believable or sympathetic, though the movie obviously wants you to sympathize for him. His lines at some point were so generic they were funny. Also his logic behind things are extremely flawed. He is supposed to be a villain who people sympathize for because of his cause, but he honestly just seems like a radical BLM terrorist. If they were trying to raise awareness for African Americas, they are doing a reverse effect if anything.
Overall the acting was bland. Even Martin Freeman was a bore. I kind of liked the Claw guy or whatever his name was as he was the closest thing to humour in the movie besides the lame attempt to be trendy with the ""what are those"" joke..
The combat isn't as occurrent as in other movies, and honestly I didn't really mind that. One thing I do think though is sometimes they overpowered the characters to a point of the little conflict there was being boring.
Visually I liked the movie a lot. The costumes were pretty cool and everything was colourful and it didn't even feel like a marvel movie. In fact it didn't even feel like a cliche movie as the aesethetic managed to distract me from the blandness of the plot till after seeing it.
The soundtrack was alright, some of the songs were good but it wasn't any LotR or Batman.
I feel like the main selling point was the fact that there was a black dominated cast. Honestly it's not that big of a deal and I don't see why people hyped this movie so much. This is 2018. It's not such a shocker to have black protagonists. And for the record, Black Panther was not the first black superhero to make it to the big screen.
As much as I don't think this should be a 97% rated movie or anything, I also disagree with the 1 star reviews on here. It's not a terrible movie. Story wise it's basically cookie cutter. But it's a marvel movie. And it has good atmosphere to it. So I give it a 7"
"framptonhollis","6","0","4","5 March 2018"," not as good or as bad as you've heard (in the opinion of this reviewer)
","One of the most hyped movies I think has ever been released, 'Black Panther' is definitely something special for Marvel, but to cinema as a whole it is somewhat mixed. Most everything about it is at least competent (except for SOME of the lesser CGI effects), but the final battle is less than compelling or entertaining, sadly drowning out some of the really great things in this film that would make it more worth a rewatching. For most of the film's running time, I genuinely enjoyed it, particularly in its first half. There is some really good humor (although there were a few moments that were rather eye-rolling in their unfunniness), some great action (I thought every action sequence was almost perfectly handled UNTIL the lengthy and frankly boring battle the film climaxes with), some very interesting concepts explored in a very fair and well done way, and an extraordinarily compelling villain whose arc does contain some real sympathy and understanding. Much of the film is a fun, entertaining ride, but towards the end it does unfortunately fall apart and breaks into some pointlessly loud and disorienting scenes of generic action and such. A very good film that could have been groundbreaking if some flaws were fixed. Not as bad as some w/overly high expectations or even an alt-right-esque racial agenda might have you think, not as great as some liberal critics and hyper reactionary twitter users may have you think; instead, it is a bit of a fun improvement of the standard Marvel affair that contains various elements that I feel could have made up a masterpiece but were sadly put slightly down by some of the film's weaker ones."

","Not the best MCU by a long way but still a good movie and worth a rewatch. Liked the story and the action as a lot more hand to hand combat than expected. I think Andy Serkis was a better villain than Michael B as Michael never felt believable as a cold blooded killer while Andy had it nailed."
"plasticanimalz","7","0","3","4 March 2018"," Entertaining
","I feel somewhere between a 6 and 7 on this one. The costumes, sets, and music are great, the action is good, but the script itself is a little wanting. Frankly, I could scrap the whole first 45 minutes of the film. Other than the action scenes the first 45 minutes are a bit flat, meandering, boring, and the story doesn't really begin until 45 minutes in. That's just bad scripting. I'm willing to forgive it's the same plot as the Lion King, 'cause it manages to be entertaining, but, it would have been nice if they'd stretched their imagination a bit further. There aren't many movies set in Africa, let alone commercial films, so, come on, give it a little more thought. <br/><br/>The side characters, like his sister, girlfriend, main guard, and ally/adversary were the highlights for me. The Black Panther character was a bit...bland. Kind of like a boring Batman. Likable, but not much to him. The sister is the most likable. Honestly, I would have rather seen a movie about her. The women really steal the show in this film, along with the big dude from the neighboring tribe who challenges BP in the beginning.<br/><br/>Maybe now that the world of BP has been set up the next one will be better? The writers don't seem to be particularly seasoned, so, I'm willing to cut them a little room, they just seem like they need to brush up on their plotting skills a bit. The whole, two bad guys thing just didn't work. It was like the first 45 minutes was practically a different film and totally unnecessary, other than the 3 minute scene to give the bad guy a reason for why he was bad. Other than that, the entire 45 minutes were utterly useless. The object they're trying to get ahold of isn't even relevant or necessary to the plot. All it does is lead the BP to the villains. In Raiders of the Lost Ark the Ark is relevant even until the last shot of the film which is why there is so much tension and it keeps you following along the whole way. The Wakanda axe was sort of like a weak Indiana Jones plot thrown in there that soon became irrelevant. <br/><br/>If they cut out the first 45 minutes and tidied it up I probably would have given it an 8. That was the movie, the rest was just a loooong, drawn out filler. The female guards were awesome. The main one, and the whole battalion. I preferred them to the Amazons in Wonder Woman. Actually, throw the Wakanda women in a movie with Wonder Woman and the Amazons and I will totally watch that. I know, they don't do DC and Marvel crossovers, but that would really make the best of those two worlds. Okay, how about the Wakanda women and the Valkyries from Thor? There should be a good Marvel team-up of the ladies. Really, all the straight, white dude, superhero stuff is pretty stale. I only went to see BP 'cause the costumes and sets looked great and I had hopes, but wasn't exactly holding my breath given the way Marvel and DC just churn them out with only a few good ones that stand out from the mass of mediocre and bad.<br/><br/>Anyway, worth a viewing in the theatre since this movie won't really hold up on the small screen."

","The movie as a whole was just good. As many reviews have said, the movie lacked a true villain, and had somewhat weak storyline. This felt similar to spiderman 3, and there were too many characters brought in at once. The Black Panther in Civil War was what i was expecting here, that is NOT what I got. He seemed to lack everything we loved about him in Civil war. At times the movie was too preachy on civil rights. Nothing wrong with that, but I am trying to escape current politics, and nowadays it seems to be everywhere. <br/><br/>Some issues with this movie. At time i felt like the music did not match what was going on in the film. Do you really expect Kendrick Lamar to be playing in a South Korean gangster bar? (its possible, BUT likely...probably not) Not once did i ever feel that the villains in this were badass, had a true motive or even evil. Maybe because I compare them to the Winter Soldier, who was an AWESOME villain. Michael B Jordan was bland and one tone throughout. He does provide great stare downs before a fight, not much after that. Not to mention i couldnt stop thinking about the Human Torch during the movie.<br/><br/>There are things i did like; the women were badass, T'Challas sister stole the show for me, and the visuals were incredible. When the black panther showed up he was awesome. Wish his fight choreography was better though. <br/><br/>I believe all the hype on this movie is due to it being released at the perfect time with all of the social movements occurring over the past two years (#OscarsSoWhite), and had strong female representation (#MeToo). It is also a Marvel Movie, that alone carries its weight in gold. It was a recipe for a Big Box Office Hit."

","As a big fan of Marvel movies, I had been patiently awaiting Black Panther's release for several months. I finally got the chance to watch it this week, and I was honestly a bit disappointed. While the movie was entertaining, it was not extraordinary. <br/><br/>First, the plot was quite predictable and cliche - an unsurprising story of revenge and political strife. Second, I felt that the character development overall was weak, particularly that of the villain. While the movie addressed the villain's motive for revenge against T'Challa, it barely explained why he thought Wakanda should change their political system. I honestly just couldn't connect to his character because it wasn't believable enough. Third, the movie relied much too heavily on cuts, and it had many poorly lit scenes that were basically impossible to see.<br/><br/>On the plus side, Black Panther had a fairly strong cast. I was impressed with their performances, particularly that of Danai Gurira. In addition, the costumes and setting were beautifully executed - more so than the average Marvel movie. <br/><br/>Overall, I'd still recommend Marvel fans see this movie, but don't set your expectations too high."

There are some scenes I really liked and thought looked great but for the most part the cinematography is bad. A lot of the effects are crap.

"hjalsayegh","7","0","2","1 March 2018"," Beautiful visuals, weak plot
","Visually this movie is beautiful. There are some baffling choices left in. At one point they camera goes upside down trying to copy something similar they did in the last Thor movie. A very, very, very, VERY crappy blue screen effect when they go into the dream state. Those however stuck out because everything else was beautiful and stylized. <br/><br/>I liked learning more about such a beautiful city where the old mixes with the new. I don't know how they even sustained it considering they don't trade with the outside so that mcguffin metal they have is just sitting there. Still it was nice to have this be about an entire civilization. They're way of life, politics and views. Not just one guy's journey to the throne.<br/><br/>For that I think it's a good movie. It's not a great one however as the plot is flimsy at best and a lot of the scenes and actions make no sense what so ever. Killmonger specifically made zero sense and every scene with him was baffling. The conclusion is also a bit of the let down, it's what would have happened had nothing, and I do mean NOTHING, happened after the first 15 minutes of the movie. You could skip all that and ended up in the exact same place."

"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","27 February 2018"," Visually and thematically phenomenal, the story falters towards the end
","Black Panther is the story of newly-crowned King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the sovereign of Wakanda, a hidden African nation secretly renowned for its technological supremacy and its hidden natural resources. T'Challa ascended to the throne after the assassination of his father during the events of Captain America: Civil War, but now he must face threats both from outside and within.<br/><br/>Marvel, once again, does not fail us. This movie might very well be one of their best in terms of visual splendour and thematic depth. The nation of Wakanda opens in front of us bright with colour, resplendent in culture and history, representing the whole spectrum of African art and creativity. Add in some really cool action and chase scenes, some cool new tech gizmos, some quality acting - some really high-end quality acting, to be truthful - as well as some really poignant questions about the responsibility of the haves towards the have-nots, and you have the makings of a great movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I do think that the latter half of the film drops the ball. Most of the events after they return back to Wakanda are... clichéd. There's really no other word for it. As soon as Michael B. Jordan's character sets foot on Wakandan soil, I could tell minute by minute, almost line by line, what would happen. And that's not a good thing. Sometimes you can make such an obvious, clichéd plot work, but this is not one of those cases. For example, there's this battle scene in the middle of the film. You know how these stories go. One of them is going to lose, because that's how the story works. So why should you care, at all, about this fight? What's at stake here? Nothing at all, that's what.<br/><br/>Black Panther is a good film. The characters are some of the best we've seen from Marvel, as are the visuals. I just wish they had had the creativity to move beyond obvious formulas and story clichés in the latter part of the story. Still, very much a film worth watching."

","I think that the only thing that will damage the social impact, and the relevance of Black Panther would be if the movie sucked, but it doesn't, so, this is one of the most important movies of recent years, side by side with Wonder Woman, is definitely a message to the world ""The times are changing!"", and man, this is so great, I really love that movement, and I get emotional with every new color kid story that I read, about how the movie was important to them, this is just fantastic, and is what the movie industry was supposed to be like.<br/><br/>Well, that topic aside, I will talk about just the movie now. I will be honest here, is not one of my favorite Marvel movie of all time, in fact, I think that has more problems than the majority of them. First the great things about it, everyone is talking about, but I have to say: Michael B. Jordan is fantastic on the movie, is definitely one of the best MCU villains by far (he doesn't have that much of a competition, but is ok). <br/><br/>You understand his character, you buy his motivation, sometimes you even think that he has a better point than the real hero (even though he is a murderer and etc). I love the character, and the way that the movie builds him.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is really good to. I love the ""world-building"" of Wakanda, you also buy what they say, that is almost an alien country that was here the whole time. Almost all the Wakanda character are good, you like them (T'Challa's sister, the Doramilages, even T'Challa himself). Buut, some aspects does not work, like T'Challa, I don't know man, I just can't like that much about him, I don't know if is the performance (Chadwick Boseman is not the most charismatic person in the world), I just really don't give that much s**t about him (in fact, Michael B. Jordan character is much more likeable). <br/><br/>The fight scenes are also a big issue that I have with the movie, most of them are with really really short lights, and you almost doesn't see anything, the cuts also are very brusque, just the Cassino scene doesn't have that issue. The CGI is also something that bother me a lot, there so much in it! (And when I say that, I know that the majority of the superhero movies have that, but the thing is, that when they are good, you just don't notice - like the first Avengers) But here, my god, the final fight is almost like a big budget video game cutscene (and is also very dark again).<br/><br/>Well, in short, even though Black Panther isn't the greatest superhero movie of all time, it's without a doubt one of the most important of all time, it's a time changer, an I really hope that a generation will be inspire by its message, that is highly important, and needs to be listen. It has some flaws, it's far from Marvel's best, but, also like WW, it's overall a good movie, and this is enough to not damage its importance."

","I think the movie really was over-hyped, but I did like it. Yes the story line has been used in other movies, but they did it pretty well. What I don't get is the Vibranium angle. It's the same stuff that Captain America's shield is made out of. It's supposed to be the toughest metal on earth, but somehow in this movie, it powers things and can be very unstable. It made me think that they were mixing it up with the Tesseract, which was an energy source. In Blank Panther, somehow the metal itself somehow gave them technology. Other than this movie, it's only know previous property has been it's toughness and it's ability to rebound energy (part of it's toughness) , not somehow store it for use at a later time. When Thor's Hammer hit the Cap's shield in t he original Avengers, it bounced all that energy back to Thor, it didn't supercharge his shield for use at a later time of his choosing. Maybe that's the technology that ""came with"" Vibranium. Don't know. Still trying to figure that one out. They kept bringing it up again and again and again. Otherwise a pretty good movie."
"Return_of_the_Porg","7","0","1","25 February 2018"," Does it live up to the hype?
","Admittedly I wasn't able to see this film on opening weekend, yet that didn't matter at all because everyone else did. The movie grossed over 200 million dollars on it's opening weekend, becoming only the fifth movie in history to do so. But is the movie really worth all the high praise? A 97% on Rotten Tomatoes and an 88 on Metacritic? Well the movie is not perfect at all but it is absolutely worth the price of admission. First of all the acting is not 100% solid, Chadwick Boseman is good but a bit bland and uninspired in the leading role. The rest of the supporting cast is serviceable but the standouts by far are Letitia Wright (Shuri), Andy Serkis (Klaue) and Michael B. Jordan (Killmonger). These performances are dynamic, electric and charismatic and are truly the best parts of the film. Michael B. Jordan gives us the most charismatic performance any MCU has ever had while delivering the most memorable and complex Marvel villain to date. I'ts a shame that he's only in about 20 minutes of the actual movie since he is one if not the best part of the film. The visual color palette in this film is amazing and yes I am talking about a Marvel film (lol). The film's cinematography and color is very pleasing to the eyes as Marvel has taken the complaints of their previous films to heart. Ryan Coogler, the director, did a great job with this film and continues to impress me at such a young age. By 31 he's already wowed me with his meticulous direction in Fruitvale Station, he's inspired me to actually get off my couch for once with Creed and now has delivered a really fun MCU film. However not all is sunshine in Wakanda as the visual effects leave much to be desired. For a Marvel flick with a budget of 200 million dollars some of the effects are plainly put, unacceptable. The uncanny valley is way too noticeable on several times during the run-time this unfortunately breaks the level of immersion and enjoyment. No spoilers, but there is a scene during the third act of the film in which I just lost it. The effects were so laughably bad, during the scene, that I just couldn't maintain my composure. I was put under the scrutiny of the whole theater as they turned towards me to try and comprehend why somebody would laugh at the climax of a film. This reaction makes me think that most people won't have a problem with the CGI this time around. Although in reality the scene looks as if it was a video game cut-scene taken right out of the Playstation 2. Regardless I think this film is worth a watch just don't expect to walk into the 12 Angry Men or the Citizen Kane of Marvel films. Curb your expectations and be ready for a flawed yet awesome good time at the cinema.

"HumanLifeMovie","6","0","1","25 February 2018"," African star wars
","I did do a twitter campaign one year and it seems that now some film makers are doing what I had hoped for, merged Africa with Hollywood. Black Panther integrates effectively the African continent into the science fiction genre. We get a version of the African star wars. <br/><br/>The manuscript has integrated values and feministic critic towards ideals about females and how to dress, actually they give another point of view of what not to wear, so in fact this is lovely, since the Hollywood stereotypes need some critic. We are more values than one on this planet and it is fresh to see that other values can be given space in a movie. Also the females are strong African women, they are also diversified, since there are different versions of their personalities. A princess a little bit rebellious, technological and scientific, which is awesome. Females in other roles than the regular. Breaking new frontiers, just as Star trek. So perhaps my header is wrong... maybe this is more of a African Star Trek, than an African Star Wars? Well, I wouldn't say that, but they do the same with norm critic as the Next generation Start trek does. But this is a fighting movie, with cool ships, advanced technology and such, which is more like Star wars. <br/><br/>The designs in this movie feel like a modern Africa, so give new technology to Africa and this is a possible outcome really. So the designs feel really African and somehow the old traditions are integrated into this movie, just as old traditions also have merged into Star Wars. Therefor this movie has more common ground with Star Wars than Star Trek really. This is indeed the African version. Also Western history and present is in question in this movie, we get some norm critic integrated into the movie. Some norm critic where really punches to the people that placed people in races, whites vs. black's in history, even today. <br/><br/>Africa is no longer a third world country in this movie, they are more advanced, but their traditions hinder them from taking over the world, they want to have better values, so they simply hide their possibilities from the rest of the world. Indirect his could be a allergory for African culture having so much good values, like being kind, loving and close to nature in many ways, and people don't really see it. The values are given space in this film. Which I think is good and we are given a perspective for a bad guys life experiences, so that we better can understand why the person ended up hateful. Of course the message in the end is to give love. That the solution is to communicate and love each other. <br/><br/>If you like science fiction, in the Star wars category, then this is the film for you. They make bad jokes, just as the real Star wars. But it is all twisted up in other values really. You'll understand once you see the movie. So enjoy Africas step up in Hollywood, from the stereotype roles as poor and full of primitive ideas to the advanced plattform of science fiction. No more blood thirsty pirates from African continent, not a first glampse anyway... can't say more than that without spoiling the movie. So enjoy African science fiction, dear reader."

Creed was a pleasant surprise, he's come a long way since getting knocked out by a soft looking British gent. I'm hoping Black Panther plays a rightfully larger role in the upcoming Avengers movie."

","What's it about?
Black Panther is the latest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe - the eighteenth movie in this grand experiment in an expanded universe. Directed by Hollywood up-and-comer Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station, Creed), the story follows T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the titular Black Panther, as he ascends to the throne of Wakanda following the death of his father in 2016's Captain America: Civil War. But things become more complicated when enemies appear, revealing dark family secrets and throwing the nation into turmoil.
Much of the early part of the film is devoted largely to world-building; Wakanda is a place quite unlike any of the rest of the Marvel universe (or the real world, for that matter). Ostensibly a poor, backward African nation (of the sort often described by Western stereotypes), Wakanda is in reality a wealthy technologically-advanced nation thriving in secret due to a rich supply of vibranium fallen centuries past from a meteor. As it has developed in isolation, its technology is fairly dissimilar from even the comics-style depictions of Western technology, and its rich culture, drawn from many real-world African sources, necessitates an exposition-heavy first act. 
The conflict begins when Ulysses Klaue, played by a scenery-chewing Andy Serkis, steals, then attempts to sell a chunk of Wakandan vibranium, and escalates when Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), an associate of Klaue, attempts to seize the throne for himself. This plunges T'Challa and his entourage, including a charmingly out-of-his depth Martin Freeman as CIA agent Everett Ross, into a violent power struggle marked by betrayal, sacrifice, and difficult questions concerning power, race, and global geopolitical dynamics.
What works?
While Chadwick Boseman makes an excellent lead, capturing simultaneously the dignity of a king and the ferocity of the Black Panther, the character has since its comics debut in 1966 been best defined by his supporting cast and the world-building around him. Clearly the creative forces behind Black Panther-writer Joe Robert Cole and writer-director Ryan Coogler-understood this point because the supporting cast is excellent and the world-building is as rich and compelling as any put to film. Among the supporting characters it is difficult to choose a single standout, but Black Panther's irreverant tech-genius sister Shuri, played by breakout star Letitia Wright, is hilarious and memorable. The Walking Dead's Danai Gurira too is incredibly compelling as the fierce Okoye, leader of the Dora Milaje, the elite squad of Wakandan women who serve as personal bodyguards to the king. Lupita Nyong'o is also quite good as T'Challa's friend and sometime love interest Nakia, while Daniel Kaluuya, Winston Duke, Angela Basset, Forest Whitaker, John Kani, and several others do excellent work in smaller roles. One climactic scene in particular showcases several of the supporting actors at their best in a complex and engrossing emotional tableau, making the scene all the more powerful.
Michael B. Jordan's performance is also excellent as Killmonger. Deliberately written to be incongruous as compared to the reserved, dignified Wakandan characters, he embraces the challenge while not ever going overboard (something that unfortunately cannot be said for co-villain actor Andy Serkis). The character himself is good, combing powerful motivations with a compelling and threatening on-screen presence. 
The world-building too is extremely compelling. Wakanda's culture is fleshed out enough that the viewer gets a sense of the rich, deep history defining the nation, and much of the technology is unique and interesting, though occasionally straying too far into comic-book unreality, testing the limits of suspension of disbelief. But the visual landscape of the Wakandan world is intricately designed and incredibly beautiful, and this reviewer for one expects it to garner some well-deserved Oscar attention in the Costume Design, Production Design, and Makeup and Hairstyling categories come next winter. 
Ludwig GÃ¶ransson's (Get Out, Creed) score is also rich and detailed, largely combining elements of both typical (though beautiful) Hollywood orchestral writing with the vibrant soundscape of traditional African song and drums, though it also incorporates hip-hop elements to great effect, as well as the occasional out-and-out pop or rap song. Between this and last year's Thor: Ragnarok, it seems that Marvel has recognized an oft-leveled criticism that its films' music is typically mediocre orchestral or electronic fare, and allowed its composers to express more individuality and build much more interesting scores (this is the first time I can recall coming out of a Marvel movie humming one of the themes). 
It would be horribly remiss to praise this film without acknowledging Ryan Coogler's superb direction. He showed with Creed that he could stage and orchestrate a fight scene as well as anyone in Hollywood, and with Black Panther he only proved that Creed was no fluke. One beautiful early fight is done mostly in long, smooth takes reminiscent of the one-shot fight from Creed, while a later one is broken and choppy (though always entirely comprehensible) in a way that helps simulate the emotional tone of the scene. The lone car chase in the film too is strong, though occasionally almost tentative, not milking its most exciting ideas for all they could be worth.
But Coogler's action directing is not the only technical aspect worthy of praise. He and cinematographer Rachel Morrison use a camera like Joshua Bell uses a violin-with a deep understanding of the content at play and a laser-like focus on communicating it to the viewer in the most powerful, visually exciting way. Marvel has had good success in the past with lesser-known directors like the Russo brothers, but with Coogler's success here and Taika Waititi's excellent work on Thor: Ragnarok, it seems like Marvel may be changing its modus operandi somewhat and allowing more-established directors to make films with more of their personal style, and it seems like an effective formula.
What doesn't?
Unfortunately, one of the greatest strengths of Black Panther-its rich supporting cast and deep world-building-is ultimately the consequence of one of its greatest downfalls; too many ideas are present for one two-hour film, and some have to suffer for it. The attention to detail devoted to the world of Wakanda and to the characters who populate it comes at the cost of a promising but ultimately flawed villain in Killmonger. Without giving away too much, Killmonger's motivations need a fair amount of exposition and development, plus a well-established, unified, ideologically-developed Wakanda. The latter is largely done, but the former is somewhat lacking. Perhaps the filmmakers would have been better served by saving the Killmonger story for a sequel-Klaue is the original main villain from the Black Panther comics, and would have served perfectly well as a villain for the standalone movie, especially with his role as a directly-opposed outsider reinforcing Wakanda's unity and isolationism, common themes from the comics. Then, with an already-built Wakanda, it would have been much easier to create a deeper thematic challenge with Killmonger. Combining all of the world-building plus two villains leads to an overstuffed plot which ultimately hinders the power of Killmonger as his own villain, though it does also result in a few excellent moments.
Some of the other characters and threads also suffer from this plot density. Daniel Kaluuya's W'Kabi in particular stands out as a wasted opportunity. Kaluuya has been proving the past few years that he deserves more attention as an actor, and his limited screen time and underdeveloped character are disappointing. Nakia and T'Challa's relationship too is perhaps somewhat underdeveloped when it deserved more.
The humor too is lacking. While the serious tone is a refreshing change after a year of humorous MCU entries, the attempts to interject jokes and humorous moments fall flat far too often; Klaue is much less funny than the writers seemed to think he would be, and there are a couple of jokes which fall depressingly flat-a ""What are thoooose?!"" joke feels dated already and the awkward way in which it's included in the scene feels uncomfortably forced. There are some good humorous moments-Winston Duke's M'Baku stands out in a few funny moments-but overall the humor does little to help the film as a whole.
But is it any good?
Yes! Marvel has a great track record, especially over the past couple years, and Black Panther is an entirely worthy addition to the MCU canon. As a film, it is probably not among the highest echelon of superhero movies, but its flaws do not prevent it from being a well-made, entertaining, and thematically-serious movie. It stands on its own too, and there's certainly no need for a potential viewer to have been caught up on the MCU, so if you like a good superhero movie, good action movie, or good movie in general, this will be right up your alley.
But the merits of Black Panther do not lie only in its successes as a film. Its cultural impact too deserves mention. Between Creed, Moonlight, and Get Out Hollywood has had a strong run of success the past few years from black writers, directors, and actors, and Black Panther represents a breaking-out of this trend into the mainstream. As of this writing, Black Panther has had one of the best Thursday previews of all time, and word-of-mouth certainly seems likely to help rather than hurt it, so it should go on to make a lot of money and good attention for Marvel. It seems that black filmmaking talent is finally coming into its own in Hollywood, and Black Panther should only serve to further this trend.
So all-in-all, Black Panther is a strong addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a successful, if imperfect, standalone movie."

","I went to see this movie probably with too high hopes due to fantastic reviews from critics but it wasnt the worst movie i ever seen it had giid action good plot and fun humor it was just a bit boring in the begging but after it sped ip it was fantastic i say go see it have a good time"
"harmony04-194-66092","6","0","1","23 February 2018"," Solid movie but not great
","Gotta say that i am wondering whats up with the critics nowadays Theyve been raving about this movie but to be honest, its nothing special or nothing new. Its a solid marvel movie but nothing to get all hyped up about. Michael B jordan and t'challa's sister are the highlights but in terms of action, special fx and storyline, it really wasnt anything above any other marvel movie. Its success is half due to the ethnic background/history of the movie industry and half due to the critics overblown reviews. I wouldnt watch it again"
"tariqhilalalbusaidi","Null","0","2","22 February 2018"," OUTSTANDING REFLECTION
","Topics discussed: 
1 - Topic: Boko Haram - Criminal organization in Nigeria. In the movie truck drivers in Nigeria taking women as hostages at the beginning of the movie.
3 - Topic: Tourism in Africa. The nature scenes throughout the movie.
4 - The contrast of Wakamba, as a powerful African nation, and the reality of the underdeveloped African nation. This contrast creates an awareness of the harsh reality of Africa.
5 - The less fortunate countries, in this case countries in Africa, do have people with skills, resources and voice to contribute to the world, if us - the more fortunate people - help them. I got this issue from my reflection on the U.N conference scene at the end."
"fanofmoststuff","7","0","5","20 February 2018"," Just because it had a black actor, it doesn't mean it's amazing.
","I liked this film. The action looked nice, better than the action in Thor: The Dark World and in Ant-Man. The acting was pretty good, it really seemed like the actors cared. 
But the main problem is that this is meant to be an origin story but it really doesn't feel like it, we still don't know a lot about Black Panther and HOW he got his suit. 
I still don't feel like all of the hype is justified, but it's not as bad as Thor: The Dark World. 
The villain is not as good as people say he is, he is not that intimidating which most of the GOOD Marvel villains are. Loki was threatening and funny, he was not. 
It feels like your average Marvel movie, and that's ok! 
If you like Marvel, watch it. You'll like it. 
But don't be close minded enough to think that this is good just because it has black people in a non-racist way. If you want black people in that sort of scenario watch: The Incredibles (Frozone is a side character but super funny!), Pulp Fiction (SLJ was amazing!), Moonlight (wonderful LGBTQ movie!), The Dark Knight Trilogy (Morgan Freeman is wonderful), and so many more! Don't let this average movie blind your criticism of black people, positive or negative."
