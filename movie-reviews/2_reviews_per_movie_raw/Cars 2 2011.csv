","I keep reading reviews for Cars 2 and I am kind of surprised. Some people went as far as comparing it to the Star Wars prequels. Sure, Cars 2 definitely is no ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Toy Story."" But it sure was fun, at least for me. The plot was an obvious reference to James Bond and Mission Impossible. I enjoyed the spy gadgets and political overtones. It was action-packed and not only enjoyable for little kids, but for older kids and adults too. Why all the hate? Heck, even Roger Ebert and Rolling Stone liked it!<br/><br/>In my opinion, Cars 1 was a little slow. It dragged a little too long in certain parts. Cars 2 suffers from no such thing.<br/><br/>To sum it up; Cars 2 may not be Toy Story but it sure is FUN and ENTERTAINING."

","I take a completely opposite view than many of Cars 2: it's a good movie! So many complain of lack of plot development, dry characters, no scope, blah, blah, blah.<br/><br/>They're missing the whole point. Like many sequels, this story homes in from a large group of characters to a smaller group, in this case on two specific characters: McQueen and Mater, with the later being the central focus. Why? Because this movie shows that people who are seemingly stupid to everyone else, ridiculed and counted out as failures, are not so stupid after all.<br/><br/>Now, Mater is not sophisticated, not quick on the uptake, and certainly not eloquent in his address to others. But what he lacks there, he makes up for in loyalty and honesty in friendship. Clumsy in social graces, he nonetheless seeks for other's good above his own. Perhaps a flaw in his character would be his willingness to take others face value; in a word he's too trusting of others. This gets him into many awkward situations, and ironically, out of many dangerous situations.<br/><br/>The plot was ingenious, weaving the racing dare between McQueen and Francesco with an international get-rich plot of ""lemon"" cars. There are so many references to past makes and models of cars that are practically nowhere to be found today! The spy plot was icing on the cake, thanks to veteran actors Michael Caine and Emily Mortimer. They really added a lot of class to the movie. It was fun watching Mater get caught up in the whole thing, and watch McQueen and the townspeople of Radiator Springs drop their jaws at what he does! <br/><br/>It boils down to two friends: McQueen and Mater. They both realize they've made mistakes and try to make them right. Mater is able to go one step further and proves he's really no dummy - and saves the day.<br/><br/>Campy? Predictable? Maybe, but I'll take a hundred of these kinds of movies to one of the dark, seedy, over-violent, bloody, depressing, and trashy movies they peddle for entertainment today.<br/><br/>GOOD JOB, PIXAR!!"
"Loving_Silence","7","246","385","11 June 2011"," A Great Summer Film, that the whole family can enjoy
","We all know that Pixar makes incredible movies, I personally have never disliked a Pixar film. The first ""Cars"" film, was a great movie, not a perfect film. It was one of the least better films, Pixar has made, but that's like saying, Insomnia was one of Christopher Nolan's worst films. I had high expectations when coming to see the film, like I always have before I see a Pixar film.<br/><br/>After my viewing of the film, I have to say Pixar never fails to produce a great, entertaining film. Although it doesn't reach the heights of Wall-E, Toy Story 3, etc. It still stands by itself pretty high up there. The animation is extremely well done, the look of the film is amazing. The voice actors are great, I miss Paul Newman though. Although the film is not perfect. The movie is not perfect though, the story is not great, but not bad, the movie does not have the emotional as other Pixar films, but it is definitely not a heartless film. But the film is definitely entertaining and a great beginning to 2011 Summer movie season. Take your whole family to see this movie, it will probably not disappoint. It will not only satisfy kids, but also the adults, this film is for everyone. Fun for kids, but the adults can also connect with it and will have a great time watching this movie in theaters. It is quite an adventure and I will be glad to give it a second viewing."
"atrpunk","6","105","158","24 June 2011"," Not what my kids and I expected...
","Espionage, assassinations, sabotage of renewable energy, propaganda, corporate cover-ups, media manipulation and The Mob...<br/><br/>James Bond? Nope. Jason Bourne? Nope. <br/><br/>Disney/Pixar's CARS 2. Wow. This movie wasn't at all what I was expecting. In the second serving of Lightning McQueen and his pals, they take their show to the international stage in a world championship race-off sponsored by oil-alternative manufacturer, Allinol. But turmoil behind the scenes pulls the gang into a world of spies, the Mob, Big Oil, evil German scientists and hit men. Now they have to save the world before it's too late. Oh, and they race too. The animation is amazing. Water, large balloons, backgrounds during races...pay attention because the quality of the graphics in this one are world-class. There are some goofy, funny moments and some nice one- liners for the older crowd. The themes of being true to yourself and bonds of friendship run strong throughout this film but it's the remainder of the message that worried me. There were non-stop put downs throughout and some other questionable topics. I was beginning to question the G rating when the villain ordered his henchmen to ""kill"" several other cars. Thinking back to the innocence and the good spirit of the first movie, I began to wonder how we got from there to here. Adventures in racing take a back-seat to the more mature plot of an espionage thriller. Looking around the theater, I could tell that kids younger than 4 or 5 were beginning to get lost. Even my ten-year-old had a hard time understanding the socio-political messages. On top of all that, I'd be willing to bet that Cars 2 is a contender for most guns, explosions and bullets fired in a G-Rated movie. This movie had much more violence than the first one.<br/><br/>Aside from the appropriateness of the movie, it wasn't bad. All the likable characters from the first movie were back with bigger roles like 'Mater & Luigi and there were many new characters added that also brought their own personalities into the mix. To me, this was an espionage-thriller so the added bonus of some comedy made the movie move right along at a good pace. <br/><br/>It was engaging for me, I enjoyed it, but the entire time I couldn't help but wonder why Disney/Pixar chose to tell this story through a kids movie."
"markdroulston","3","409","655","22 June 2011"," Such a disappointment
","16 years ago, Pixar Animation Studios released the first feature length computer animated film in history, Toy Story. What followed was an incredible run of success, an 11 film hot streak that yielded dozens of awards (including 11 Oscars), billions of dollars in box office receipts, and the admiration of audiences and critics everywhere. Year after year Pixar was a company you could rely on, and while not all the films were perfect, they all were at least of decent quality, and light years ahead of their competition from the likes of Dreamworks and Sony. So therefore it's heart-breaking to say that Pixar's hot streak has come to a crashing halt in 2011. Cars 2 is not just the weakest film in Pixar's catalogue, it is the worst high-profile animated release for some time.<br/><br/>If there is one Pixar film that divides opinion much more than any other, it is 2006's Cars. While by no means a bad film, it just didn't hit in the same way as films like Toy Story, Finding Nemo, or The Incredibles. It did middling numbers at the box office (by Pixar standards) and currently sits with a 74% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the only film from the studio below 90%. For director John Lasseter (also head of Pixar), Cars is obviously a very personal film, a nostalgic story about the loss small-town American values in the face of increased modernity. If it's not a complete success, credit must be given to Lasseter for at least trying to say something meaningful, and in typical Pixar fashion the film stands out in the increasingly crowded computer animation film market for at least attempting thematic depth, and it's ability to reach audiences both young and old. Cars 2 on the other hand is completely devoid of depth and subtlety, and will more than likely annoy adults while at times being arguably inappropriate for children. Returning director Lasseter takes the worst character from the first film (in my opinion the biggest reason for Cars' failure), and structures the whole story around his infuriating exploits. Imagine George Lucas, upon seeing the negative feedback following The Phantom Menace, making all of Episode 2 about Jar-Jar Binks. That's the kind of thing we're left with in Cars 2. Compounding the story problems is the troubling amount of guns and violence in the film. To make the argument that 'it's OK because they're just cars' is inexcusable. This is still supposed to be a children's film, and while the espionage sub-plot does have potential, there are elements that seem shockingly unsuitable for young kids.<br/><br/>This brings up a question: why would Pixar choose to revisit the only film they have produced which could conceivably be called a failure? Lasseter is on record as saying that the company would only explore sequels to their films if a good story could be developed, and the level of quality of the two Toy Story sequels seems to back up this sentiment, but it's hard to believe that anyone would think the script of Cars 2 is worthy of that high standard. Interestingly, there is one other way that Cars stands apart from other Pixar films: the estimated $8 billion merchandising revenues. While all Pixar films have profited from merchandising, none have had the global appeal of Cars. It's upsetting to think that Pixar, a company who seemed previously to place greater importance on the quality of its films than the bottom line, have gone for the easy cash grab, but there really seems to be no other reason for the existence of Cars 2. Everything about the films seems designed to increase the potential for selling merchandise, whether it's the films global locations which pander to international audiences, or the increasingly ridiculous characters and set-pieces, tailor made to be toys and video games. It's a cynical opinion, one which I had hoped I'd never feel towards a Pixar film, but it is undeniably true: Cars 2 is a film created not as an artistic endeavour, but to feed ancillary markets.<br/><br/>Pixar's golden run had to end sometime, and one bad film is a small price to pay for 11 good, with two or three being genuine masterpieces. What is most unfortunate is the catastrophic level of Cars 2's failure, and Pixar will undoubtedly lose a lot of respect for making such a soulless film, unworthy of the studio's name."
"ARTaylor","5","177","275","24 June 2011"," How the Mighty have Fallen
","We hoped it would never happen, but no one is perfect. Even the best can stumble. This had to happen eventually. Even the string of terrific Disney's classic films and the 90s Disney Renaissance didn't last forever. I'm afraid that, yes, Pixar has made a bad film.<br/><br/>Cars 1 was their least ambitious film. The story was predictable and character development obvious making it their most mediocre film. It was good but it lacked that little extra touch that made their films great. However, they had some great side characters, a heart, and wonderful scenes that elevated it up beyond most other films. But ever since this film's announcement I always wondered why. McQueen had his story and there's not much else to tell. Like Finding Nemo, where else is there to go? And I'd rather see sequels to better movies like The Incredibles, even Bug's Life seems to have more potential. It's easy to see why they made a sequel to it, since all you need to do is go to Disneyland or any Disney Store and see it covered in McQueen and Mater, which happened to be two my of three year-old cousin's first words. Off all the Pixar films, Cars made the most with the merchandise.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is the story. Cars 1, while predictable, was touching. Cars 2 has almost no heart or character development. The focus shifts from McQueen to Mater. McQueen had his story in the first and there's little to tell here. He has one character moment that's essentially the same realization as the first film's. The problem with Mater is that he's such a simple character. Everything about him is on the surface for all to see. He's the same person throughout the movie, with one predictable realization which goes no where, that he doesn't warrant his own film. He's like Kronk from The Emperor's New Groove. They're both terrific side characters but lack enough complexity for a full story. And Larry the Cable Guy has always been better with the other Blue Collar guys rather than on his own.<br/><br/>While Cars 1's highlight was its side characters, this movie almost abandons them. They do nothing. McMissile is a moving plot device and little more. Shiftwell is supposed to be a love interest but lacks any interesting moments. The rest of Radiator Springs basically sit back while McQueen and Mater have all the fun. Their stories and character are pushed aside so Larry can have fun being Mater. Because of this, there are almost no funny little side scenes where characters just have fun being themselves. Instead, most of the humor is derived from seeing Mater do silly things.<br/><br/>The look is impressive but not more than anything else Pixar's done. With each movie, the studio has pushed the graphics into new levels. Each movie has had some wow moment where audiences can't help but be amazed by what they're seeing. There were times in Cars 1 when it looked almost real. Cars 2 lacks any wow factor. One of the most impressive sets, Tokyo, were already spoiled by the Tokyo Mater short. This more than anything makes me wonder if Pixar was even trying to up the ante or if they were just using what they had to make a movie a year.<br/><br/>Spies and Cars seems to work well together. After all, any Bond or Bourne film will easily demonstrate why the two go together. Indeed, the opening scene on the drilling platform is easily the best with the fast chase and cool gadgets. But they weren't able to properly combine the racing and spy elements, almost as if you're watching two movies at once. There's too much spy stuff for the racing to be interesting, which becomes pointless against the overpowering and overly clichÃ©d spy story. Perhaps Pixar should have set it as simply a spy movie set in the Cars universe and had McQueen and his friends in cameos or as a background story.<br/><br/>Another lousy spot is the music. Cars 1 had a terrific soundtrack with excellent uses of popular songs like Life is a Highway and Route 66. But there's not one memorable song or music cue in this movie. Giacchino usually does terrific work like with The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and Up. But he too fumbles the ball here. Perhaps he was just uninspired by what he had to work with.<br/><br/>Cars is Lasseter's pet project. But I think he's too close to it. He's got that Lucas Star Wars prequel trilogy problem. The people around him either were in awe of the man who made Pixar and Toy Story or they were afraid to hurt his feelings since he loves the Cars franchise so much. Pixar efforts have been so well done because they were collaborative efforts, each fixing each other's problems to make a better project. But with Lasseter off working more directly with Disney, he really should have had a co-director or perhaps given the reins to someone else like he did with Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>I almost rated this movie higher. It is fun while you're watching it, even if as soon as it's over it becomes too easy to pick apart the problems. But this is Pixar. They've dominated the animation market since Toy Story and have been pushing the boundaries at the Academy Awards ever since. To see them stumble with a not-so-great film would be one thing. But they're coming off from two Best Picture nominees to a movie that's simply flashy but with little substance. Kids will love the bright colors and silly antics, but parents will hate having to then buy twelve new Mater toys. Cars 2 is stalled and in need of a tune-up."

","Sometimes you go to a Pixar movie and get a deeply insightful, heart-tugging classic that sings to the deepest corners of the human condition.<br/><br/>And sometimes you go to a Pixar movie for some uncomplicated fun and adventure.<br/><br/>""Cars 2"" is unapologetically the latter; it never reaches the emotional depths of ""Up"" or ""Toy Story 3"", but it never tries to be. Instead, this is a family-friendly action-packed adventure movie, the kind of movie you watch because you just want to sit back and enjoy the spectacle. Whether it's the gorgeous scenery, the breakneck chase sequences, or Finn McMissile's never-ending arsenal of cool gadgets, ""Cars 2"" is a movie that simply wants you to have fun as you follow along with its whirlwind escapades.<br/><br/>Some might feel this is a disappointment from Pixar, but I think that's being unfair -- after all, no one begrudges Steven Spielberg for producing both ""Schinder's List"" and ""Indiana Jones"".<br/><br/>""Cars 2"" isn't high art, but it never tries to be. Even the best creators deserve to cut back and have fun once in a while."

","I knew I would like this film, but I was very pleasantly surprised at how amazing I found it. As a hold-out and a bit of a cranky git, I confess I am one of those who find the 3D experience an annoyance. Maybe if they someday come up with a contraption-free (no glasses) way to see it, I might like it. My cinema only had it in 3D. Drat.<br/><br/>However, the 3D annoying gimmick aside- I was thrilled by the lush beauty of this movie. I was also gratified by the depth and meaningful quality of the story. Recounting the plot here would not accomplish anything, so I'll skip it. Let us say that if the outcomes of all the plot points were probably predictable, that's OK--- As a ""comedy"" that is the formula- and it was well served.<br/><br/>I was entranced throughout.<br/><br/>Emily Mortimer's solid feminine sweetness and likability came through- and Michael Cain was a hoot. And the skillful comedic actor Eddie Izzard's characterisation was also true to his particular form. The cast from the first Cars film all seemed to be here as well- to good effect.<br/><br/>I will note that this did not seem like a film made for small children at all. My auditorium was filled with the little guys- a cute and amiable crew, to be sure. But I cannot imagine that they would find the characters and the intricate story intelligible. And the jaw-droppingly beautiful scenery and artwork would also likely be lost on them.<br/><br/>I loved this movie!"
"Juan994","10","72","111","25 June 2011"," It's not what they say, It's what you enjoy.
","I'm finding myself very disappointed by the generally critics about ""Cars 2"", and I found the nucleus of the issue the fact that Pixar's latest movies have had a very philosophical idea floating around (Wall-e, Up, Toy Story 3) and the ""Cars"" franchise it's not about that.<br/><br/>Does ""Ratatouille"" have a philosophical script? I'm afraid not, ""A Bugs Life""? Sure not, But they accomplish another goal, they were made for another approach, a different image and a different perception of the movie.<br/><br/>Is Pixar a philosophy-related books maker? Is Pixar a adult-animations producer? They're not, they're great storytelling guys (They found out a way to link the whole world without making a ""Around the World in 80 Days"" film), they make the gorgeous 3D scenarios (I was astonished by the great detail of London and Porto Corsa) and they develop almost perfect characters (Who in the world will link as many cars parts with body parts as Pixar did?) and most important, they bring entertainment to the audience, and ""Cars 2"" fills all those gaps.<br/><br/>I'm afraid this is the result of what happens when someone (in this case Pixar) develops a great reputation and suddenly they came up with something different of what we are used to, and it became for some people a ""horrifying"" creation.<br/><br/>I enjoyed ""Cars 2"" since the stressful opening scene until the happy ending and I think is because I entered the theater hoping to have a great time, fun and a visually amazing experience, and not hoping to find the anthropological greatest creation, and that's exactly what I got."

","The best of Pixar's films have protagonists who are a small part of a very large world and are almost helpless against incredible odds - Toy Story, Wall-E, Finding Nemo etc. The protagonists of Cars are very big in a very small world, so do not play to the strengths of Pixar.<br/><br/>However, being Pixar, they still make these films better than anyone else would have with the same material. Cars and Cars 2 are intelligently written and filled with more detail than you could comfortably fit into a single screening.<br/><br/>This movie is not so much a sequel to the first as an affectionate James Bond parody that happens to be set in the Cars universe. Whereas the original Cars was thematically slow and patient, this one deliberately takes things in the exact opposite direction. Whether anyone will prefer the first film or the second is entirely their preference, and it is wrong to say that one is better than the other. Each film has its own appeals and drawbacks.<br/><br/>The main weakness of this film is a failure to create any kind of sympathy for the characters. They are not alone, they are not lost, they have friends and allies and the resources to get out of any situation. It never feels like there is any real danger, as there is with the Toy Story films. Whereas the first film had enough focus on character development to compensate for this, the subplot about the tested friendship between McQueen and Mater seems especially insubstantial here.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I feel like this is an enjoyable installment in the franchise, never letting your attention wander and always ready with a clever idea. They have demonstrated that they are willing to go in entirely new directions with this world - maybe if they make a third film, they can make something truly worthy of the Pixar name?<br/><br/>If I were rating this in comparison to other Pixar films, my score would be lower... but scoring this as a film on its own, I think it is deserving of between five and seven stars."
"TourettesPersonal","7","39","58","27 August 2011"," Something's Missing
","The saddest thing about Pixar today is, they don't know what movie they are going to release on their 25th Anniversary since one of their upcoming projects ""Newt"" was cancelled despite from Blue Sky's Rio plot. Cars 2 feels like it's a direct-to-DVD film. It's not really bad but it's just unnecessary. Though, the action is pretty cool. The kids will enjoy it but the rest is like Rango. Instead of Western Themes, it's Spy movies. The story isn't bad except it doesn't give anything emotional and heartwarming unlike the other Pixar movies. Cars 2 is pretty fun but the most important ingredient of their movies is missing.<br/><br/>Firstly, the lead of the film is Mater. The theme of the film is Espionage but it's just some sort of an animated version of a particular spy movie. Everything moves here. There are too many action that any kid can enjoy but the story is probably too interesting for grown ups. If the movie gets focused to the plot, the kids might get bored. The missing Pixar element here is the heartwarming moments. The movie still has a heart but it fails to be compelling. Don't worry about the humor, that is one thing they will never fail. Some of the writing seems rushed.<br/><br/>The voices do what they do best. John Lasseter knows what to do in this movie. The animation is obviously pretty good. The score is a bit generic that you may hear in any movie or television show. The action keeps everything moving. Watching the car fighting scenes is like watching a kid playing his little toy cars and let them do something fun. Which is pretty impressive.<br/><br/>In Pixar, the craftsmanship or the animation doesn't quite matter. It's all about the compelling story and the emotional heartwarming moments. It's hard to say Cars 2 is bad film. Pixar still knows how to make a good movie but without their important elements, it's like you're watching a movie from a different studio. Once again, it's pretty fun but if you expect a lot of Pixar magic then you might get disappointed."

Mater's character in the first one provided comic relief for the movie. In Cars 2, they made the comic relief the main character. The entire movie was based around Mater and that is what made it funny. But for some people there was to much of him and not enough of the original Lightning McQueen.

Liked Raoue Carole as well. I just had two major pet peeves with it: it focused on Mater. Mater already had his own little spin-off of ""Mater's Tall Tales"" which I love. A movie centered on him just didn't do it for me. Had it been on Lightning (like the first one) or any other character I would have been okay. It may have to do with the fact that I'm no Mater fan. My second beef was Doc Hudson wasn't in it. I know why, I understand wanting to honor Paul Newman (whom I adored), hate to sound callous, but the show goes on. If he ended up with a different voice then so be it. Better yet, he could have been in it for a few seconds, and just not say anything at all.

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>Cars 2 switches tracks a bit from being based in a small town to world-wide jet setter and oddly Mater seems to take center stage in this film. This film plays out like a Bond film and Mater sort of like the Pink Panther (if I understand that character correctly) as someone who inadvertently gets in the way of criminals and their plans and sort of helps the secret agents along the way, while McQueen competes in worldwide races. As an automobile and racing fan, I loved this film as there were a plethora of fun, foreign and classic cars all mixed in along the way and the races mixed NASCAR, Formula 1, Rally, and other endurance sports cars; pretty neat. From a parent of a small child perspective, it was a little advanced for kids as there was a theme of big oil vs alternative fuels and a lot more guns and peril for a G Rated movie and from the first Cars. Overall, it was fun and exciting and amusing humor of Mater the rural bloke vs international high scale people."

","I am one of the few that actually had more fun with this sequel than the first one. Sure, it has elements that has been done in other movies before, except it revolves around living cars. But the creativity and clever moments makes this one a entertaining ride. While the first one's protagonist was Lightning this time, the likable hillbilly truck Mater takes the spotlight. Sure, he maybe dunce but he is a likable and funny dunce. One of the premise that doesn't get old for me, is where a average or below Joe gets put in a over a top situation. And some of the characters surrounding him or her mistakenly think he or she to be some sort of a amazing hero or heroine. The dialogue is hip and fun, the comedic parts may seem a bit childish, but it's clever and I personally thought it was funny. The animation goes into another level with this one, and the detail when it comes to the environments which takes place in Radiator Springs, Japan, Paris and England. And the animation is again superb and better. Sure, it's not in depth or emotional as the other Pixar movies, but it's still a entertaining good time. I also think the transition to Mater was a good idea, because it brings out a certain amount of uniqueness. As a matter of fact this movie kinda reminded me of animated version ""Tucker & Dale vs. Evil"", except it's for the whole family to enjoy.<br/><br/>7.8/10"

We all loved the first movie, it had a simple to follow, heart-warming story and NO VIOLENCE!!!<br/><br/>This movie had TONS of violence, guns, ""dead"" cars, cars getting bashed, burned, tortured. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!?!? Just because it was cars and not people did you think the kids wouldn't notice? It was a very hard to follow story for them. A full-on James Bond movie, with twists and gadgets, except in animation and with cars instead of humans.<br/><br/>My twins could not repeat the story back to us when asked afterward. Espionage, oil wars and the likes were lost on the younger audience. The violence was full-on. Even Mater, the plain, redneck, lovable character was fitted with machine guns!! In fact the movie was more a Mater movie than a Lightning McQueen movie. We see McQueen in very few scenes compared. It more like a full feature Mater Tale than a sequel to the movie... plus it wasn't about racing at all but rather about oil wars.<br/><br/>Very disappointing. My husband made a good point, he said it was as if it was aimed to the 8 year old who watched the original 5 years ago and are now 13 years old. Certainly NOT aimed at young kids. If your kids are very young and you do not approve of violence, beatings, killings and guns DO NOT TAKE THEM. I wish someone had warned us, we wouldn't have gone. <br/><br/>I can't fathom what Pixar was thinking! I am now dreading Monsters INC 2... it will most certainly be ... I don't know... full of blood and guts? That seems to be their next step..."

","Pixar have had better films, I will admit, but this was actually a good film. I saw this film yesterday, in London, and it was on the big screen and in 3d . I was very impressed by this film and it is very hard to say which one of the cars films was the best.<br/><br/>I went to see it with my family which had not seen the first film. They could understand it. I'm sure that shows that Pixar don't just make identical films.<br/><br/>Cars 2 is a film for all the family and you must see it, it will be worth it. Just ignore all the other reviews that say 'Pixar could have done better' and all that. When people say that it was a waste of time to make it, it was not! Do you realise that Pixar have been working on this since august 2008! This film is not repeat not a waste of time and money!"

","As an ardent fan of the first Cars, I was shocked at what an absolute mess this movie is. I was prepared for a certain level of disappointment from the trailers, but I didn't expect the sheer second-rate train wreck that is this movie. All the heart of the first film has been chucked out the window on the way to cashing in on merchandising possibilities.<br/><br/>McQueen has been practically relegated to minor character status here (one wonders why Owen Wilson even bothered showing up). Occasional glimmers of clever humor are all but eclipsed by a rickety plot that can't bear the weight of all it's trying to accomplish. Mater's hi-jinx as the centerpiece of a ridiculous (and unfunny) spy plot go from annoying to disturbing as the violence ratchets up. While several critics have claimed this sequel is aimed at particularly young audiences, no other children's movie you're likely to see in the near future does more to glorify gun violence.<br/><br/>Pixar has sucked all the dimensionality out of every returning character, and the new ones it's added are so one-dimensional as to be nonexistent. This is a pathetic offering from a studio that should know better."
"tomduerr584","4","76","137","27 June 2011"," This is not a Pixar Movie.
","When I go to see a Pixar movie I expect to be blown away. Cars 2 simply did not. There were many problems with Cars 2, mainly that the story strength just was not there. Yes it did have some funny moments but they were few and far between. The main problem with this movie however was that Pixar made Mater, voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, the main character. After 20 minutes into the movie I wanted to leave because of how annoying he was. Larry is annoying as a human, making him a the main character as a car is just stupid. It was honestly the only Pixar movie so far that I left feeling completely nothing. What a disappointment this was as this topped my summer movie list. What a disappointment..."

","I have watched this movie and I would say that it is not as bad as some have written about it over here. It is quite good.<br/><br/>The visual effects are well done. Voice acting is superb (Caine is awesome). Action scenes are excellent, well-thought and intellectually appealing.<br/><br/>The only weakness I can see is that there is too much excitement being stuffed and most of them are quite childish. But, come on guys, isn't this movie supposed to be for the children (not only under-13, but children in each one of us too!).<br/><br/>Please remember this fact and go to the movie, you'll surely appreciate it better.

My kids were 2.5 and 4 years old. Had I known I would not have taken my children. Questionable G-Rating. This is Cars meets Bourne Identity/James Bond.

Oil companies, mafia, espionage etc.<br/><br/>The first movie had a great heart warming story and many great characters. There ware no memorable characters in this movie. The first had great music and scenes and action and is re-watchable many times.....where-as I was bored in the sequel...boring and too long.<br/><br/>I wish they developed the locations and characters more.

"gedard1","6","45","82","24 June 2011"," Not the best of Pixar
","I enjoy kids movies, I really do. But this fails to deliver a great story. Cars was a good movie with a great plot. But Cars 2 was a mix of stories. The sequels are never like the first one and this is not the exception.<br/><br/>The cars aren't developed enough to care about them. Mater(Larry the cable guy) fails. He was funny at the first one but now he is simply annoying. <br/><br/>International espionage? Really? I Don't think that was a good idea for the plot. The 3-D is kinda useless like it happen with Kung Fu Panda 2. Maybe not all movies have to be made in 3-D.<br/><br/>Overall, was a bit enjoyable in some parts but if you are waiting for a great sequel you are going to get disappointed."
"oneguyrambling","5","3","3","28 December 2011"," Bits for the kiddies, bits for the grown-ups, unfortunately not enough for either.
","Technically Cars 2 looks amazing, as all animated films do nowadays. There were times when I was looking at close ups of various automobile parts and I could've believed they were photos.<br/><br/>The problem is that everything is just a little off. A little forced. A littleÂ… clumsy.<br/><br/>In the past Pixar has made concessions to no-one, sure they had their share of cute toys, animals and in this case cars, but they made films without the 'for'.<br/><br/>They weren't 'for' kids. They weren't 'for' adults. They simply were. If you got it â€“ and most people did â€“ great. If you didn't, well you Sir/Madam were in the minority. <br/><br/>Here there are sections for the kiddies and sections for the adults.<br/><br/>The kids sections are mostly alright and revolve around a global series of races between Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) and a cocksure F1 race car named Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro).<br/><br/>The 'grown up' part is where things go a little awry, it seems Pixar have spent so many years hearing about the little touches that set them apart that they decided to throw as many little touches into Cars 2 as they could. The result is a thousand ideas trying to get through the door at the same time. Each time the spy part came back to the centre I found myself wanting them to start another race so it could be simpler to like.<br/><br/>Cars carefully tries to pander to as many demographics and groups in the audience as possible. The toddlers like the bright colours and cars of course (there were three ads prior to the film marketing them), the other kids laugh at the funny voices and dream of one day racing their own car, the grow-ups get the more adult references including the subplot about spy-cars voiced by Michael Caine and Emily Mortimer (do you really think a kid will get the Bond stuff?) and recognise the notable voice cameos, (I was told afterward that the guys from The Deadliest Catch and some real life race drivers all had minor roles. I am neither a Deadliest Catch or racing fan so I caught neither).<br/><br/>The problem is that in blatantly trying to pander to every audience â€“ again something Pixar has needed/bothered to do before â€“ Cars 2 becomes everything and nothing to no-one. <br/><br/>Everyone gets something but not enough of it. After a while I gave up trying to feign interest in the spy stuff which is sporadically included and channelled my inner toddler by waiting for the next car race scene. At least the byplay between Bernoulli and McQueen is your standard trash talking and not the try-hard spy stuff or the slightly forced 'save the world through efficient fuel message. Don't they realise they are a planet full of cars?<br/><br/>Oh, and there is a dreadfully misguided 'lesson' to be had here. The hotted up, successful and universally adored Lightning McQueen finds best pal Mater â€“ a rusty old tow truck with a redneck accent and social deficiencies â€“ a pain in social situations and basically alienates him early in the film. It takes the rest of the film and numerous pieces of advice from others, before McQueen learns that friends are friends.<br/><br/>If that's what it takes to learn that McQueen is a dick, and Mater would've been better served without his 'friendship'.<br/><br/>Final Rating â€“ 5.5 / 10. I still liked most of Cars 2. So did a couple of mates who took their kids. My 4 Â½ year old liked Cars 2, but nowhere near as much as he likes Nemo and Toy Story. I think that will prove the legacy of Cars 2, a film that tries so hard to please everyone that it will end up the film that everyone 'kinda likes'.<br/><br/>Just not enough to bother watching it again. Sorry Pixar but after 15 years you finally dropped the ball."

","I was unfortunate enough to see this while taking car of someone's children. I had heard all the negative reviews, but even I didn't expect *this*.<br/><br/>If it had been any other animation company, it would have been passable by everyone's standards. But this is *Pixar*, the same folks who brought us The Incredibles, A Bug's life, Monster's Inc., and the heart-felt Up. I still can't believe that the same company made this.<br/><br/>The animation was not like Pixar at all. It was so cartoony and had none of that beautiful realism. Though the first Cars isn't my *favorite* Pixar film, there were loads of moments where I ooohed and ahhed as light hit the cars. BUT THERE WAS NONE OF THAT in this movie.<br/><br/>I also think Pixar didn't realize who their audience was. The first Cars was tremendously popular mostly because of the Nascar fans in the South. And guess what? Those same Nascar fans do not give a fig about some European Grand Prix. And nor do those Nascar folks care about going green. Politics in a Pixar movie? C'mon. <br/><br/>Mater NEVER annoyed me in the first film--in fact, he was one of my favorite parts in the first Cars. And yet he bugged me so much in this movie! Congrats, Pixar. You've taken a well-loved character and put audiences against him. You'd think those ""intelligent"" spies in the movie would have noticed he wasn't a spy. And that's another thing--spies? Really?<br/><br/>I hate to be so negative, but that's how it is.<br/><br/>Now Brave is a much more anxiously-awaited film, because it will either sink Pixar or redeem them.<br/><br/>You can do better than this, Pixar. We know you can."
"icazares","3","34","62","26 June 2011"," Not recommended- Period
","I just came back from the movie. It wouldn't be enough to say that the movie didn't live up to my expectations. It wouldn't be enough to say that this is, by far, the worst Pixar movie. I have to say more. I have to say that there aren't many redeemable qualities in Cars 2. But if I have to select the major problem of this movie is that Pixar has failed to its primary audience. This is a movie with a story extremely difficult to follow, and on top of that, illogic. This is a movie with dozens of explosions and shootings. This is a movie with a duration of almost two hours. You don't need to be a genius to figure out that a long complex illogic movie full of machine guns is not the best fit for the intended audience. I left the theatre thinking... don't these guys run focus groups? How do they come with a failure like this just a year after producing what I regard as the greatest animated movie of all times? They have proved many times that what they know what they do.<br/><br/>So in the first Cars, which I liked, there was a compelling story. It was about transformation, maturity and life perspective. It was funny too. Everything rotated around something profound. It made sense. In Cars 2, someone at Pixar thought that a script around Mater as an unintended secret agent would be worth of a movie. But sadly, the circumstance was never upgraded to become a concept. I left the theatre empty. Cars 2 has been a big disappointment."
"3xHCCH","6","11","17","24 July 2011"," Mater may be a good Sidekick, but a good Lead he is not!
","""Cars 2"" is an unusual case of a highly anticipated film that was not simultaneously released here locally as in the States. I wonder why? Anyway after I watched this film, I think I know why. For all the positive goodwill that the first Cars film had, this film was a relative disappointment.<br/><br/>I will not knock the artwork. This definitely maintains the high standards that elevate all Pixar films with regards to quality of animation. The racing and hi-jinx spy sequences done in familiar landmark locales all over the world were all very excellently rendered. There was action in the roads, underwater and the skies. This time we get to see talking boats and planes, aside from just the titular cars. <br/><br/>For me the problem was with the story. I think the complex spy story that underlies this installment, and the highfalutin spy lingo it uses, flies over the comprehension of the young kiddie audience it caters to. I do not think kids would fully understand about the issues on alternative fuels or on ""lemon"" cars. These ""adult"" issues that motivate the villains' violent actions will make it hard for kids to really get the story without parental explanation. I think it was not too cool to see cars being ""killed"" in some very violent scenes. I do not think it was a good idea to kids to see their gentle favorite Mater with rocket boosters and machine guns.<br/><br/>Contrary to most expectations, Lightning McQueen is NOT the hero of Cars 2. The central character in this one is Mater, whom we knew as the loyal sidekick. Unfortunately, for me at least, Mater did not cut it as leading man. His awkward country bumpkin demeanor and hick-town country drawl were only funny from the side, but was rather hard to take when it was front and center most of the time. <br/><br/>After Mater, the cars with more screen time than McQueen were British spy cars Finn McMissile and Holley Shiftwell. While they were both quintessentially cool British secret agents, they also blow the beloved ""heart and soul"" of the first Cars movie out of this film's focus. You hardly even see Sally and the rest of the Radiator Springs gang. It was also that the focus of the whole film was more the ""James Bond""-like spy story, while the races were merely incidental."

Mater escapes to warn his friends of a bomb planted in McQueen's pit, but Finn and Holley find out that the bomb is actually planted in Mater's air-filter. They warn him about the bomb, but he flees to protect his friends. As a reward for his heroism, Mater receives an honorary knighthood from the Queen and returns home with his friends, where the cars from the World Grand Prix take part in the unofficial Radiator Springs race. Fillmore reveals that before the last race, Sarge replaced McQueen's Allinol with Fillmore's organic fuel (which prevented McQueen from being affected by the weapon). McMissile and Shiftwell arrive and invite Mater to join them in another spy mission, but he graciously turns it down. He does ask Shiftwell for a date when she returns which she accepts. He gets to keep the rockets they gave him earlier, which he now uses in the Radiator Springs race. Excited!!"
"bio_weapon","10","6","8","21 January 2014"," Still it's a great film
","Well, many people describes Cars 2 as ""disappointment"". I don't think so. As a Pixar movie, it might not be as good as others, but still it's a great film. Perhaps we expect Pixar too much. After the year of 2008, we had wanted to see next Pixar film even better than Wall-E(I think it's the best of all). But can it be easy? Recently I've seen a lot of Hollywood cartoon movies. Among them were some wonderful films, also boring ones. Cars(1%2) is special, which makes me feel totally differently from any other one. The character McQueen impresses me deeply and the relationship between he and Mater is as fantastic as well. I had expected Cars 2 could get a rate of 7.5, at least 7. But it only gets 6.4! Even lower than Turbo(6.5, DreamWorks Cartoon). Strange!"
"your_overlord","7","18","32","26 June 2011"," Bad!
","This animated film is neither for children nor for adults. Bad screenplay, violent, clichÃ© till extreme, this film is the complete confusion. It's too long, boring and pointless 3D CG cartoon. My six-year old daughter asked me to leave the cinema, because she was bored. Decline of Pixar in the quality screenplay began with Ratatouille, through UP and Toy Story 3, the fall turned into the nosedive with this one. To say this is the bad movie is a compliment. The concept of a spy movie like a 007, which itself is outdated, has totally missed the target for the younger viewers, who expect humor, joy and laughter. These three things you will not find in this film. Save your money. Save your time. Save your kids."

"Thunderbuck","3","4","5","19 November 2011"," I don't know where to start...
","I can't believe I'm saying this about a Pixar film, but ""Cars 2"" is a monumental waste of talent and technology. And what concerns me most is that what this movie gets wrong is the most important thing Pixar has always gotten right.<br/><br/>The storytelling is a massive letdown, for a few reasons. The first is that I think they tried to stretch the anthropomorphism of the cars too far; in an early suspense scene secret agent Finn McMissile (voiced by Michael Caine) sneaks around on an oil platform in ways that make him seem well-nigh invincible, and another character who arrives later is able to sprout wings and fly... Why would a car want to roll when it could fly, anyway? The espionage angle didn't have to fall flat (and I actually really liked the way McMissile was executed as a character), but it took these characters to a place they really didn't seem to belong, a fairly brutal murder just being one instance. We also learn somewhat more about the toilet habits of cars here, which starts to beg the question of how they fulfil other biological needs. In the first movie we didn't even START to go there, and I'm not sure it was a great creative decision here.<br/><br/>The characters are flat, which is an unusual Pixar failing, too. There is a cardboard kind of friendship between Lightning McQueen and sidekick Tow Mater that seems mailed in from a '70s after-school special, and verges on creepy. Poor 'Mater is the subject of a great many jokes, few of which are really terribly funny.<br/><br/>The ""new-enviro-fuel-threatened-by-evil-big-oil"" is okay, if a little over-simplified, and I ""got"" the film's notion that it's the ""lemons"" of the world who hold us back, but I was a bit conflicted over the ending (and, yes, the SPOILER ALERT goes here). Sir Miles Axelrod (Eddie Izzard) is an older Range Rover oil baron who has supposedly seen the light and converted to greener technology, though in the end he turns out to be the mastermind working to discredit his own alternative fuel, as he has since found a massive sub-ocean oil deposit. On one hand, this twist seemed to discredit the notion of alternative fuel entirely, but I also have to admit that such corporate ""greenwashing"" actually exists. Frankly, ""Monsters, Inc."" had a similar message, but it was much clearer there.<br/><br/>Story and character are pretty important, and Cars 2 fails miserably on both counts. Technically? Well, that's a brighter side there, as everything LOOKS fantastic. And I'll confess that I enjoyed many, MANY in-jokes. The movie is FILLED with Easter eggs for both car nuts and Pixar fans.<br/><br/>One of the best little ""inside baseball"" moments came when an American agent who had infiltrated the bad guys disguised as an old Gremlin took off his disguise to reveal himself as a new Dodge Challenger; Chrysler bought AMC back in the 80s, and this scene almost seemed a symbol of its renewal. Unfortunately, this and many other moments suggest that Pixar may have worked fairly closely with Chrysler in a rather subversive form of product placement. A race that takes place in a very Monaco-like locale was actually moved to Italy, I suspect as an excuse to feature many Fiat models; Fiat, of course, now owns Chrysler.<br/><br/>Clever in-jokes can't be the basis for a movie on their own. Particularly when many of them seem to be motivated by marketing. Even that MIGHT have been forgivable with decent characters and story. Lacking these, ""Cars 2"" is Pixar's first unqualified failure."
"EijnarAmadeus","5","4","5","18 November 2011"," Disappointingly Mediocre
","Pixar Studios makes the best animation films out there, and they've been showing over and over again their elaborateness when making them. Sadly I saw that CARS 2 seemed more like a machinery for money, than a movie with an actual heart. The plot is thin and sadly uninspired, and the actions herein revolves around fast-paced dialog and fire and explosions. The original CARS had charm and atmosphere, and although it wasn't the best piece of Pixar, it had an all-and-all good standard. CARS 2 doesn't have it, and I found myself missing all the good contents that has become trademarks of Pixar's films. This may be a new low for the company and crew, so one can only hope that they'll bounce back and show us that they've still got it."
"tappingjeff","7","4","5","23 August 2011"," Out the Heart, In the Fun
","Cars 2 may be one of Pixar's weakest, but that's certainly the biggest weakness of them all. <br/><br/>In the latest installment, Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is getting ready for a worldwide competition, the World Grand Prix, and takes his old pal Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) with him to the opening race. A turn of events gets Mater caught up in a secret spy mission, led by Finn McMissile and Holley Shiftwell, to stop the ""lemon"" cars from initiating an attach against new electric oil, Allinol, for their more profitable and less eco-savvy crude oil reserves. Sounds like a high concept story for a kids film, but Cars 2 succeeds, because it doesn't ever treat it's audience like their in a childlike fantasy that the characters would otherwise seem to make up.<br/><br/>With big eyes, and cars with mouths, it's the most ridiculous (and adolescent) of Pixar's features, and yet the rest of the animation is stunning; the flashy, high-energy kinetic vibe of Tokyo to the dreamy Italian landscape, all of the animation in this film is stunning; i would daresay some of Pixar's best. This film, unlike many other sequels, actually attempts something new. It brings a whole new definition to the previously established series, this time accenting the youth-obsessed sports car age, both with the James Bond-esque plot and the eco-savvy thematic conflicts. It's high voltage, and it's a whole lot of fun. The pacing is non- stop and the action sequences are done brilliantly. That being said, what it makes of thrills and action, it sags in emotional heart and laughs. <br/><br/>Though the film banks on current environmental arguments to delve into the theme of being proud of who you truly are and the value of friendship, it it loses the depth of the film in the action that we have come to expect from Pixar. In fact, having seen Pixar's other films is the weakest aspect. You know how good they can be, so to see them not on their A-game (I would call it at least a B-game), many critics took it down. But even though it's animation outshines it's emotional core, it's a whole lot of fun. B+"

","I love Pizar. Since the original Toy Story debuted I have religiously gone to opening weekend to watch every new release, and have never been disappointed. Until now.<br/><br/>I took my 2 1/2 year old daughter to see what I naturally believed would be another great family flick. Instead she spent half the movie looking away and the other half saying ""ouchie"" as the violence ripped across the screen. I truly felt bad that I subjected her to it as I kept telling myself this is a Pixar film it will get better.<br/><br/>About the halfway point in the flick when Pixar officially sold out to State Farm Insurance and gave them their own line I realized this movie would be past redemption, but I got my $5 matinÃ©e worth and stuck it out. This is my first review and I cannot emphasize enough to other parents out there DO NOT take your child to see this movie, it is a mish mash of a storyline about being yourself and defeating big oil and loving State Farm all thrown into one.<br/><br/>2 out of 10 only because there is a great bathroom scene in Japan that showed there was a little bit of Pixar thrown into the film."

Congratuilations to all the staff for all these fireworks. Then the story was packed with some good spy elements Ã  la James Bond. The fly scenes were well executed too and there was more action than in the first Car. It offers also a great tour in Europe nicest countries as in Paris, Rome, Riviera, London and in Tokio.<br/><br/>I think this is the plan how all the coming animation movies should be made. Suspense and in the same time very near plot to the reality could like children and adults. Just take the examples Ice Age or Rio.<br/><br/>Final vote: 9/10"

","'CARS 2': Two Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Pixar Studio's 12th animated feature, and without a doubt it's all time low point, is this sequel to the 2006 hit original. Another tale of the adventures of Lightning McQueen and buddy Mater in a world of all living cars and other automobiles. John Lasseter (who also directed the original and first two 'TOY STORY' films) returned to direct the film (his first time doing so since the film's predecessor five years ago) with newcomer Brad Lewis. It was written by Lasseter, Lewis, Dan Fogelman and Ben Queen. The film is only the third sequel Pixar has released (after the second and third 'TOY STORY' films) but many more are planned. This is not a good sign by the looks of 'CARS 2'. Hopefully this was just a speed bump but it was not a good film by any means and by no measure lived up to the previous standards set by the respectable studio.<br/><br/>The film picks up with race car Lightning McQueen (once again voiced by Owen Wilson) returning home to his hometown of Radiator Springs after a successful racing trip. His best friend, the tow truck named Mater (once again voiced by Larry the Cable Guy), is overjoyed to see him. After spending a day together catching up Mater quickly becomes jealous when McQueen wants to spend time with his girlfriend Sally (Bonnie Hunt reprising her role) alone. He then gets heated up when he hears a cocky Grand Prix race car named Francesco (John Tuturro) boasting how he could easily take McQueen in any race, on TV. Mater calls up the news show and challenges the race car which leads to McQueen entering the Grand Prix and taking Mater along with him. Once there Mater becomes involved in an espionage adventure (through a classic movie mistaken identity scenario) and teams up with two spies (voiced by Michael Caine and Emily Mortimer).<br/><br/>The film does have a positive message about friendship and being true to yourself regardless of how others treat you because of it, as well as an environmental message about alternative fuel sources, but it seems tacked on and forced. The rest of the movie is a pain to get through to get to it and not quality entertainment for anyone (of any age). I was extremely bored and annoyed by the film and I could tell most others in the theater I was seeing it in were as well. Kids were crying and being antsy and parents were moaning and constantly yawning. The film barely got any laughs or signs of positive emotion from anyone in the theater that I could tell. The magic just wasn't there like with other Pixar films. The movie is loud, clanky and simply put a mess. The characters are underwritten and the story barely holds together for it's nearly two hour running time. Nothing about the film works. It feels like a bad Saturday morning hangover. All except for the visuals, the visuals are still grade A but for the money spent on the film ($200 million) they should be a lot better. Pixar definitely has run low on gas, at least for the time being. Hopefully it can get a jump start.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHRJKrR2Lk"
"Ryan_Barbakins","2","2","2","18 May 2019"," Cars 2, A Cinematic Failure
","Okay where do I start.
The entire premise of making a film that is revolving around a side character usually doesn't work, and this film is no exception. Mater is a dumb tow-truck used for comic-relief and nothing in the first film even hints at anything more than that, and this film makes it seem as if mater is some sort of hero, when he is not.
When you want to make a sequel of a film, a good way to do that is to answer a frequently asked question about the film's universe and solve it by making the film. For example, Toy Story's universe sought the question ""What happens to toys when they are abandoned?"" and made a sequel out of it. I don't think anyone in their right mind would watch Cars and think ""I wonder where the spy cars are?"" It is such a stupid and unnecessary way to expand the universe.
The plot makes absolutely zero sense. The villains are oil diggers, and make prophet from cars buying oil. Their evil plan was to make Allinal (Alternative fuel) look bad by blowing up cars so that the public will stick to oil. However the creator of Allinal is in on the evil cars' plan. So they basically created alternative fuel just to make it look bad so people can stop using it, and use oil, EVEN THOUGH EVERYONE WAS ALREADY USING OIL!
Mater somehow is the one to figure out who the bad guy is. If you watch the scene where he figures it out, it's just so hilariously bad that it hurts. Somehow, Mater was able to figure out Axlerod's plan even though it was so idiotic that even the Spy cars right next to him couldn't figure it out, because it just wouldn't make sense for it to happen. Cars 1 made Mater to be an unintelligent side character, but he is somehow able to solve a mystery that Spy cars who are trained in this field couldn't figure out.
I don't usually poke at movies for being convenient, since just about every film is at least slightly convenient, but this film takes it to another level. For this film to work, you have to have the evil cars come up with an idiotic plan that makes no sense. The intelligent spy cars must be dumb enough to believe that Mater is the American Spy. You also have to have lightning McQueen be dumb enough to believe Mater is talking to him during the first race. Then you have to have Lightning go against literally everything he learned in the first film just so Mater can get sad and try to leave on a plane. Finally you need Mater to figure out the stupid evil plan that the spy cars couldn't even figure out.
Everything that this film does is something way off of what the first film created. I am all for the expanding of a universe if done good, and it isn't done good in this film. The only slightly interesting and accurate- to-the-universe plot in this film is quickly abandoned at the end with no real conclusion.
Every little detail in this film seems to be there just so they could make a prophet on it from Toys. For example, the rocket jets, giant cars (that show up for a good 5 seconds in the actual film) and even the freaking wannabe race cars that the film never even explored.
From 1995-2010 Pixar made nothing but spectacular, intriguing, heartwarming films. This was the first Pixar film that wasn't good, and it was also their first non-Toy Story Sequel. Like I said, From 1995-2010 all of Pixar's films were great, and from 2011-2018 (Present) There are only 3 films (out of the 9 they made) that I believe live up to the standards of the 2000s Pixar Films. What I'm trying to say, is that this film was the beginning of Pixar's downfall.
And that is why this film is one of my least favorite films of all time."
"cricketbat","4","2","2","25 July 2018"," Mater is like Tabasco sauce, a little bit is fine, but too much is overpowering.
","Even though Cars 2 is a Disney/Pixar production about espionage, it's sadly quite boring. I think part of the problem comes from the fact that they rely on most of the humor coming from Mater - and that doesn't work. Mater is like Tabasco sauce, a little bit is fine, but too much is overpowering. This movie just doesn't have the heart that other Pixar films have."
"j-58183","9","2","2","11 November 2017"," Not as bad as you'd think and looks lovely ðŸ˜Š
","I loved the original cars movie. It is one of those movies I can stick on and watch nonstop without it ever getting old. So when cars 2 was released I was excited for more Lightning McQueen and friends.<br/><br/>Cars 2 starts differently than its predecessor. It's like a spy movie instead, with fast paced spy cars and villains (like from a cheesy bond film) We see Cars fighting and doing stunts for a bit, and we are introduced to the lead spy Finn Mcmissile. It eventually cuts to Radiator Springs and we can tell that Mater is going to feature heavily in this movie. Now Mater is not everyone's cup of tea. I know I don't like him all that much but kids do. Anyway, Lightning comes home from winning his 4th piston cup and he and Mater play around for a bit before Lightning goes on a date with his girlfriend.<br/><br/>We learn there's to be a world racing tour on and Mater inadvertently gets Lightning in it with a heap of international racers ( the Italian guy, Francesco, is a hoot!) though only one was a lady, but that's Pixar's choice and so their fault for not having more variety with their characters genders. At the same time there's a heap of spy stuff going on about some alternative fuel sources, defective car types being discriminated against, an oil deposit out at sea, and Mater accidentally gets involved with all this with Finn and another agent called Holley Shiftwell. <br/><br/>This is the movies main focus, the spy stuff and not racing. Lightning doesn't know about the spy stuff till near the end of the movie and just does races. The races, of which there are only 3 which is odd for a WORLD tour, are beautiful to look at. Seriously, the one in Italy is so life like! Just like a really Italian seaside town with more racing areas built in. But there's not enough focus on them or the racers which is one of the movies problems. What we do see of them is fast paced and exciting though. That was a highlight of the movie.<br/><br/>This was one of the main complaints from people. Not enough racing. If you look in the cars 2 artbook you can see that all kinds of races were also planned like an endurance one, a race in Russia, the Blackforest of Germany and other places across the globe. It's a pity we didn't see these.<br/><br/>But it all boils down to Lightning finding out about Mater doing spy stuff, revealing the lead villain and making up as friends after an argument. The last third of the movie is really silly, with flying rocket cars and over the top fighting but it made people laugh and the young members of my family were happy. Once the bad guys have been stopped and Mater is knighted by the Queen car of England of all things, everyone goes back to Radiator Springs for some friendly fun. Lightning even becomes friends with the Italian racer who was constantly teasing him.<br/><br/>It's a very silly movie really though there is some violence like one car being overheated till his engine blew. But I've see worse in cartoons. It looks spectacular and the races are fun. I loved Lightning and the other racers when you saw them and the spy stuff was amusing at times. It's just Mater I cannot abide in such large doses. He's not a good main character and not everyone goes for his type of humour. Kids like him though, so maybe that's why he was the star of the movie and not Lightning. I give it an 8 out of ten as I do find it beautiful, well animated fun but Mater makes me take of 2 whole stars."
"antonio4912","7","2","2","22 September 2016"," ...I don't know what to say....
","Alright, alright, 7/10 might seem like too much for this movie. And it might be, honestly, but I have a few reasons why I would consider this a 7/10. Pros and Cons<br/><br/>Pro: The villain's plan is original, and is pretty genius. Basically, the main bad guy makes an alternative fuel that, while it works perfectly, is made highly dangerous by some kind of radiation or something, which makes the cars EXPLODE. Since the world is watching the race, they will stop trying to innovate with Alternative Fuels, and go back to regular gasoline, which the bad guys own most of.<br/><br/>Con: Mater. Just. Mater Now, I would love to say ""oh, he's kind of funny"" but he isn't. 90% of this movie (aside from the finale) is just him acting like an idiot in front of people. I do love the scene at the beginning of the first race, where Mater is instructing Mcqueen during the race. It shows some real friendship between them.<br/><br/>Pro: The spy stuff, when it's allowed to breathe, is actually extremely awesome and exciting.<br/><br/>Now, I've read a few things in the comments here, saying that this movie is ""too violent"" for kids (Forgetting the other, honestly, messed up things in the other 11 Pixar movies before this one). Now, the scene where they blow up the guy on screen, maybe, but the other stuff is so cool. Sure, Michael Cane is clearly just phoning it in by this point, but he does fine as typical spy guy. The opening scene of the movie was perfect, and the airport chase and the finale chase were also awesome<br/><br/>Con: The other residents of the town were wasted entirely<br/><br/>Let's be honest, though. Cars has never been the series for deep, character studies (minus Doc Hudson), but I wish that these people were able to do more than just basically make brief cameos. <br/><br/>In the end, I feel that Cars 2 is worth the watch, of course. But don't expect it to be in the Toy Story 3 or Inside Out range of film."

","Cars 2 (2011): Dir: John Lasseter / Voices: Owen Wilson, Larry the Cable Guy, Michael Caine, Emily Mortimer, John Turturro: Exciting sequel to the original animated hit. This time the plot involves some secret agent cars and a big Grand Prix race where Lightning McQueen is up against major competition from Italy. Director John Lasseter brought the Toy Story films to life and here again he proves Pixar as a big profit by creating a sequel to Cars that is creative and entertaining. Owen Wilson again voices race car McQueen who returns home to Radiator Springs after several winnings. His return is welcomed by Mater the rusty tow truck whose free spirited red neck antics are often well intentioned but misfiring. When summoned to another challenge he is urged to bring Mater with him. Larry the Cable Guy voices Mater whose persona is scorned but he is also mistaken for an agent. This lands him in some amusing situations that he doesn't fully comprehend until he must save the day. Michael Caine and Emily Mortimer voice two agents who go through several near falls to bring down an evil car tycoon. Even they will have to rely on Mater to prevail when they cannot. John Turturro voices the main racing antagonist and the accent provides some amusing moments as Turturro sneers and charms his way to the finals. Beautifully animated with many funny moments, this film wisely attempts different story aspects through spy clichÃ©s. While it lacks the freshness and originality of the first film, families will likely engage in this rat race of recklessness and completely absurdity. Score: 6 / 10"

","If you mentally switch out the vehicles in Cars with post-human description of entire cyborg societies where the beings can constantly update themselves and switch out their own body's mechanics, Cars is kinda trippy.<br/><br/>If you do that with Cars 2, you'll completely lose your mind and probably get paranoia-laced nightmares for weeks.<br/><br/>It's not just that the characters have personalities of their own and even things like empathy, friendship, and ego that is the problem. It's the fact that they're self-aware of damage and get to choose whether to keep it or leave it while blowing each other up to smithereens, over issues like self-recognition.<br/><br/>In other words, it's a really good movie. A few random people here and there wondered about ""how the world was supposed to work"" in Cars, and it seems like Pixar responded by giving them the finger. It's not that they have that in mind while they're making it--Pixar probably meets criticism with a shrug of, ""Yeah but our movies make millions and are children's fantasies with actual stories, so we'll just go about doing our work and you can deal."" However the point I'm making here is that though the more open theme of environmentalism is going to be the one getting the most press, the subtheme of identity politics is what drives this movie (pun intended), and that makes it closer to The Incredibles 2 than any of their other works, really.<br/><br/>However, I'm hoping that their two summers in a row of sequels is just a temporary aside while they pull together their plans for more original characters, because though their narratives aren't suffering, characters like Lightning McQueen and Mater can get to be a little insufferable. This movie is better than its original but I'm still thirsty for more.<br/><br/>Cheers, --PolarisDiB"
"DilbertW01","3","13","25","27 June 2011"," Pixar continues its slow descent
","I was so looking forward to Cars 2. The action and the animation are very exciting and eye catching. However, the story was lacking. It did not have the magic of the first one. More importantly, Pixar had to slide a politically correct, liberal, environmentalist theme in it with the 'alternative fuel' topic. I am so sick and tired of the hoax that is 'global warming', hearing about 'go green' and how gas / oil is the great evil. I didn't need two hours of that garbage shoved down my throat. If that agenda had been left out of the movie, it would have been much more enjoyable. It was good to see the characters again. There will be plenty of ideas for the diecast Cars characters collectors (which I am one). However, the 2nd movie just does not measure up to the first one. The music soundtrack of the first one blows this one away. There were very few songs in this one. Go see it just because it has been 5 years of waiting. Just don't get your hopes too high."
"MelanieHamilton","3","13","25","26 June 2011"," A preachy piece about ""evil big oil""
","Most of the reviews cover everything I want to say as far as the heaviness of the plot, the lack of character development, etc. Why hasn't anyone mentioned that this was a not-so-covert attack on ""big oil""? Really? In a children's film? Twenty minutes into this movie I leaned over to my seatmate and said ""this is going to be about the evils of oil companies"". Not only did Pixar disappoint with an overstuffed plot that was not amusing in the slightest, they decided to get all preachy about alternative fuels. So I suppose all that merchandise that is loading down half the shelves in Wal-Mart and Target are all made from recycled plastic in eco friendly factories? Or that the money from the film is being donated to help those who HAVE been adversely affected by oil spills and toxic run-offs? If there's one thing I hate when going into a movie it's being preached at by the entertainment industry. Just like with Wall-E, I was incensed at the ridiculous audacity of ANYONE in the entertainment industry getting on some high horse about the environment. Of all the trash-making industries in the world, the entertainment industry is by far the most disposable. We could all do better by switching to bio-fuels and we could all do with less stuff. We don't need to be told that by effing Disney. I love movies, don't get me wrong. If they stopped making movies tomorrow, I would cry. A lot. I just really hate it when an incredibly stinking rich company waggles their finger at commercialism/consumerism/pollution all the while they are busy destroying our environment making toys, DVDs, and cheap clothes - in China. That is THE LAST time I spend $50 going to the movies, especially a Disney movie. From now on, I'm going to the $3 theater. Suck it."
"martinmcdonough","3","9","16","21 July 2011"," Highly and Thoroughly Disappointing
","I have to say that I was completely disappointed by this movie. When I first read about the plot two years ago, I didn't think that a race around the world and having Larry the Mater Guy being mistaken for an international spy would work, but since it was being done by Pixar, and John Lasseter in particular, I'd give it a chance.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, my intuition was right.<br/><br/>First of all, I thought this movie was way too violent for a G rating (see the bathroom scene where the American agent car gets beaten up for example). I suppose I should have thought twice when I saw a toy Larry the Mater Guy truck with machine guns in my local grocery store.<br/><br/>Secondly, why was Owen Wilson even given top billing for his role as Lightning McQueen? He was a secondary character at best. The first movie was about relationships and finding what's important in life, and so on. This movie? Merchandising.<br/><br/>Third, Larry the Mater Guy cannot carry a movie on his own (animated, pixellated or otherwise). His actions were funny for the first five minutes or so, but come on here. This whole ""fish out of water"" stuff (or, in this case, hayseed in the big city) wears thin quickly.<br/><br/>Fourth, can we please get OFF the ""big oil is bad"" bandwagon, at least for kids movies? Aren't they being brainwashed enough? A kids movie is supposed to be a kids movie, plain and simple. Fun, lighthearted, and entertaining. Maybe even a song thrown in here and there. They don't need to be sent a message just yet. Let them be kids for crying out loud. Let them discover Michael Moore when they're in high school.<br/><br/>The movie did have, however, a few redeeming qualities. As usual, Pixar creates a highly detailed, richly defined, visually appealing world for both the characters and audience. John Turturro hams it up as the Italian Formula-1 racer. Michael Caine never disappoints (Jaws 4 notwithstanding).<br/><br/>But all you need to know about this movie is what my five year old son did when it was over. He is, presumably, in the target audience for a G rated film, and is a huge fan of the first movie. When the movie was over, he stood up and (literally) yelled, ""I don't like this movie!"" Enough said."

I like it very much when my kid is in love with the original cars and every time he watch that he is playing in another world. but this one even he did not enjoy that even when he waited for weeks and ask every day about the release date. to animation makers: this time of the history has too much violence, please make for peace."

","OK, so maybe Cars 2 doesn't peer into the meaning of life like the Toy Story series, and maybe it doesn't look into universal human truths like Wall-E or Up. However, it doesn't have to. Not all movies need to aspire to the heights of philosophy. Cars 2 was beautifully animated (sometimes breathtakingly so), laugh-out-loud funny at times, and in general, a fun summer popcorn movie that has a broad appeal.<br/><br/>It would, though, have been nice to feature the supporting characters a bit more heavily - I missed Sally and the Radiator Springs crew. However, it was good to see a strong female character featured, which in the animated world, is rare in non-princess movies. It was also fun to see some of Luigi and Guido's back-story.<br/><br/>My only minor quibble was that it was perhaps a bit more violent than it could have been (or maybe should have been, given the young age of the average Lightning McQueen fanatic). However, the violence was usually kept at acceptable levels (comparable to ""Kung Fu Panda,"" I'd say - just with explosions rather than karate chops).<br/><br/>Like any Pixar movie, there are hundreds of references to other movies, pop culture, and history sprinkled through the film which will require many repeated viewings to pick up. (Of course, anyone with kids will end up viewing it repeatedly anyway, so being a parent of a small child, I personally appreciate this feature!) So, while Cars 2 won't be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, or likely a Best Picture Oscar, it was definitely worth seeing."
"japamo","7","5","8","28 June 2011"," Pixar's ""Transformers"" Movie
","One prominent notion stood out in my mind after watching ""Cars 2"" - it was the Energizer Bunny on speed, steroids, and any other drug that gives you superhuman endurance. From the opening shot where a British spy operative is communicating oil rig coordinates to suave James Bondesque agent Finn McMissile (voice of the ubiquitous Michael Caine) to the last shot in Radiator Springs where Gomer Pylesque tow truck Mater is hailed as a hero, ""Cars 2"" hits the ground running (or rather, racing) and almost never stops. Cars zipping around, racing, diving, skydiving, flying, the movie is seemingly an adrenaline junkie's dream. It was exciting, up to a point, then it eventually became too noisy and tiresome - like, some would say, a Transformers movie.<br/><br/>(PLOT SYNOPSIS: on a dare from the boastful Italian Formula One (I guess) race car Francesco Bernoulli (sp?) (John Turturro), superstar racer Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) challenges him to three races in Tokyo, Paris, and London. This secondary plot is just a pretext for McQueen to bring his ""goofy goober"" buddy and mechanic Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) along just so Mater can unwittingly blunder into a Bondian ""Big Oil vs. Alternative Fuel"" spy caper orchestrated by McMissile and his capable young assistant Holly Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer).)<br/><br/>The races and the spy caper both move at Road Runner speed, sometimes parallel, sometimes intersecting where a mysterious villain is eliminating race car participants with an electromagnetic field in a plot to blame their crashes on the alternative ethanol they must use and bolster Big Oil. Yes, I know, it's confusing. Besides the incessant action, you also get meticulously rendered depictions of all three cities and bright, splashy colors (if nothing else, ""Cars 2"" is visually enthralling). You also get a depiction of what the world would be like if sentient cars, buses, helicopters, and ships ran it (Example: Cars must remove their wheels to go through airport security). There's a lot to process in the movie. Maybe too much.<br/><br/>Again, I call ""Cars 2"" Pixar's Transformer's movie because it is noisy, busy, stuffed with colorful characters, locations, weapons, and hardware, and sometimes needlessly complex and hard to follow. In spite of all the action andviolence (which should have received a PG rating, at least),occasionally I found my attention drifting. When Mater eventually deduces that Axelrod (the alternative fuel mogul) and not the German mastermind (Professor Z) is responsible for the race car sabotages, and explains his reasoning, it seemed half-baked and vague. Some Scooby-Doo mysteries have more coherent explanations. If adults could get confused by all this, I would imagine that young children watching ""Cars 2"" would get bored and tune out completely.<br/><br/>So, did I like the movie? Generally, yes. ""Cars 2"" does maintain Pixar's record for producing ambitious, intelligent movies with important morals (in this case, stay true to yourself and never underestimate anyone, even a country bumpkin). However, the frenetic action and labyrinthine Bond plot unfortunately weigh it down. Nevertheless, there is more good stuff than bad stuff to make ""Cars 2"" a respectable, if not exceptional, addition to Pixar's canon.<br/><br/>P.S.: Actually, it would have been kind of cool to have one of the vehicles be a ""Transformers""-type robot!"
"mooviefan-891-879574","7","5","8","26 June 2011"," for an animation movie is great for a Pixar movie is just OK
","As many people mentioned before Cars is a movie that didn't deserved a sequel. I mean, talking cars is not the best idea to start with but somehow they managed to bring some emotions in part one. I remember that I was a little bored with the slow pace of the first Cars, but again they tried to connect the audience with the characters ( in my opinion McQueen is not a likable one). In the end Cars was good but it was missing something. Now, the sequel goes a completely different way, and first I thought that was a good and original move, but I also think that Mater has a lot of time on screen and frankly that is annoying ( it is the typical character that always screw things off but hey we love him because he has a big big heart and he will never let his friend down come on¡¡¡ that is so childlish and its okay for the kids, but we know that Pixar has made it to the top because they connect with kids and adults equally. Im not saying that you will have a bad time, because the movie its entertaining, but it lacks heart and genuine emotions. And that for a Pixar movie is just sad. Hopefully they deliver a better film next year."
"dfranzen70","10","5","8","26 June 2011"," Top shelf sequel
","Pixar seems immune to the problems that studios normally have with their sequels, in that Pixar's sequels don't, you know, stink. Cars 2, like the Toy Story films, captures every bit of sincerity, thrills, and pitch-perfect animation that the original did. It's a beautifully shot movie with terrific voice characterizations, including a surprisingly awesome turn by Larry the Cable Guy.<br/><br/>In the movie, Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has settled down in Radiator Springs with his girlfriend Sally Carerra (Bonnie Hunt) when he is goaded into joining a three-country race by an Italian Formula One car voiced by John Turturro (who's hilarious). Naturally, Lightning must take along his bestest best friend, Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), who's - shall we say - not as world wise as McQueen or the rest of his crew. Hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>To add to the tension, all of the racers are required to use a new alternative fuel invented by eco-awesome-dude Sir Miles Axelrod (Eddie Izzard), but when a few cars mysteriously explode during the first leg of the race, in Tokyo, people start to wonder if the fuel is indeed safe. Of course it is - because the real culprit - as we learn right away! - is employing electromagnetic pulses to disable the vehicles in the hopes that people will blame the fuel, which will bring them back to good ol' yummy oil. But tipped off to this subterfuge is British agent Finn McMissle (Michael Caine) who, along with his new-to-the-field sidekick Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer), is out to stop whoever's behind all of this - and that, my friends, is where Mater comes in.<br/><br/>This isn't really a Lightning McQueen movie; he's more of a supporting character, as Mater is unwittingly pulled into the espionage business by the Brits, who mistake him for a fellow agent (those English are so gullible!). But because of Mater's inelegance and lack of focus, McQueen winds up losing that first race, a result for which he blames a crestfallen Mater. There's your friendship conflict, always a reliable trope in animation.<br/><br/>The race then shifts to Milan and then London, with Tuturro's Bernoulli and Wilson's McQueen trading many a barb and insult (with Bernoulli usually winning). This allows the animators to mix in some awesome scenery from both countries, and you'll swear it's filmed rather than animated. Absolutely spell binding.<br/><br/>The two plots, the spy angle and the brotherly friendship deal, dovetail nicely by movie's end, but not before we're honestly treated to some spectacular stunt driving (ahem) - off roofs, down parking garages, and so on. It's like parkour for cars, which most of us would call driving but the cars here probably call walking and climbing.<br/><br/>I saw this movie not only in 3D but also in IMAX. I've said harsh things about 3D, and IMAX costs even more per movie. It's all worth it here. The colors are vibrant, and when something SHOULD leap out at you, it does, and it looks really, really good. The sound is shattering; your seat will rumble. It's a visual orgy."

","I am a HUGE fan of the original and have watched it over a 100 times with my youngest son (He would take his Cars cars and re-enact scenes with the movie playing). I was thrilled to see Pixar making a sequel. However, I have to say this one is much darker and has much more action and plays a lot like a spy movie or an episode of Burn Notice or Covert Affairs. I really enjoyed this as a movie and not as a sequel. It is visually superb and has a good message of friendship. However, I found that it just didn't quite have the charm of the first. Don't get me wrong, it's a really good movie and if you watch it without expecting a sappy sequel and go in with an open mind, you'll have a blast!"

","Cars 2 is not what I expected. It was better then I expected back in 2006 when CARS made it's debut it was aimed at younger children like my son who was 2 years old when he saw it in the theatre and it captured his attention. Now my don id 7 years old and his youngest brother is 2 years old and we took them to see CARS 2. They LOVED IT. Cars 2 is not made for adults it is made for kids pure and simple but Cars 2 grew up with it's audience. the theme is the same it is about friendship and being there for your friends and This time it is also about not being afraid to be yourself. The Story is not complicated which is good because it is a kids movie after all and those should never be too complicated. There is more action in this one then the first one and maybe a better story in this one then the first. The only drawback is no Paul Newman who sadly died before he could take his part as Doc Hudson . But We did Get Michael Caine as Finn Mcmissile a secret agent in the James Bond mold. The magic continues. See it and make your mind up for yourself Pixar didn't stumble when they made this flick. They grew up and brought more of the magic with them for us to enjoy."
"ModishMovies","9","3","4","21 February 2018"," Cars 2 is Truly an Underrated Masterpiece
","Cars 2 is easily the best film from a usually unemotional, unoriginal studio -- Pixar -- that has finally mastered the art of cinema! This the most intelligent, emotional, and riveting movie since Pulp Fiction. The action is unique and exciting, the animation is stunning and pleasing, and the score is better than every other spy movie. Without all of these flawless technical achievements, Cars 2 would still stand out for its fabulous story and deep, complex characters.<br/><br/>Many people who lack true taste in cinema would claim that the story is contrived and confusing, but that is only because they lack the mental capacity necessary to comprehend such a deep, complex, and emotional story that requires viewers to understand interesting and unusual, but ultimately rewarding situations. Many people also may object to making Mater the protagonist of this film. If anything, Mater is the greatest character f the entire Cars franchise because he has depth and emotion and feels unpredictable in his development, unlike Lightning McQueen who finds a way to be a spoiled brat in every single movie only to come around by the end. Mater does not come from the privileged racing background that McQueen and others come from. He is modest and compassionate, even if others don't understand him completely. Through Mater and his misadventures, John Lasseter intelligently reveals how understanding and empathy will always solve problems instead of create them. That is proven many times throughout this film when Mater is misunderstood by cars who believe themselves to be more superior than a plain, old tow-truck. Sure, many of the misunderstandings are small moments that are played for great comedy and successful laughs, but others are intelligent and deepen the characters and plot. It isn't until the end when Mater reveals to them who he truly is and the other cars come to understand him that all of the problems are resolved. <br/><br/>That is why I believe that Cars 2 has the greatest message of all the Pixar films. Many may say Inside Out has the best message that encourages kids to embrace sadness, but that is only a good message if you enjoy seeing sad children cry and suffer. In the end, Cars 2 is a very rewarding experience, both for kids who only will enjoy this film for its face value entertainment and stunningly-animated action scenes and for the adults looking for a deep, intellectual story or compassion and understanding. Definitely a must-watch for any cinema-lover or person who wants to be nice.

"OllieSuave-007","8","3","4","22 February 2015"," More exciting than Cars!
","This is a Disney/Pixar sequel about hot-shot race car Lightening McQueen who travels to Japan with best friend Mater for the World Grand Prix. While McQueen tries to win the race, Mater gets himself caught in the path of Holly Shiftwell and Finn McMissile, spies on a mission to stop a sabotage plot created by old cars called ""lemons."" <br/><br/>John Lasseter and Brad Lewis did a great job in directing this movie, grasping the audience's attention from the start with a thrilling espionage sequence. The story then picks up steam pretty quickly with McQueen getting himself into the Grand Prix race by Mater and then inadvertently getting Mater into the espionage ordeal. With all the spies searching for clues to the ""lemons"" trying to sabotage the good cars, the plot gives you good ol' fashion spy movie excitement and quite a lot of thrills and suspense.<br/><br/>The entire voice cast did a nice job in their respective roles, making the characters memorable. Owen Wilson continued with his convincing hot-shot personality of McQueen, Larry the Cable Guy did his country-old style personality of Mater, Michael Caine did a nice job voicing Finn McMissile with his British accent and Emily Mortimer did a charming job in voicing Holley Shiftwell. I enjoyed seeing the various the human traits exhibit in the car characters and also enjoyed the terrific visual/special effects and animation work, especially capturing the splendid scenery of Tokyo, Paris and London.<br/><br/>I thought too much emphasis was placed on Mater and not enough on Lightening McQueen. But, overall, I believe this sequel is more funner and exciting than the first Cars movie - definitely worth the watch by the entire family! <br/><br/>Grade B+"

I thought, Mater as the main character was the best idea! But after a little while into the movie.. maybe 40 minutes, you just lose that smile and start thinking how confusing this movie may be? Like, I didn't understand! Yes, the movie was really dark, that was the good part, but the story I thought got a little off-track! I didn't understand who the villain was, and such on..

","First off,10 stars is too much, but i believe this movie needs a push in the ratings. I'm not in the hate club for this film. Let me ask the critics, wasn't this the last pixar film that showed how bold they were? They were bold enough to make a different film. After the terrible criticism this bold and different movie received, Pixar just lost their nerve. They made safe * good for rotten tomatoes* movies. What about inside out? You ask. Yes, its good at a creative level. But there is no strong opponent or conflict, leaving you unsatisfied about the story (i haven't seen coco, yet).
Coming to this film, there is good action, but the story is too complicated for kids (Pixar films are aimed at adults too). Movie has a lot of cool scenes, and overall its a great film. Getting away from a racing plot line was good too."
"digdwheeler","9","4","6","29 June 2011"," not getting the credit it deserves
","I've read a few of the reviews for this movie on here and felt I needed to add my own piece. I couldn't disagree more with most of the reviews. I thought this movie was wonderful. It was infinitely better than the first cars which while was a cute movie and endearing, but a bit boring, and yes predictable, but its a children's movie, of course its going to be predictable. Disney and Pixar aren't out to trick the audience and keep them guessing, they are out to entertain you and leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling at the end, this is Disney and Pixar not Paramount or Lion's gate, they make family films people. That being said, I thought this movie was very entertaining. It had much more action in it and a great story. Personally I'm glad they focused more on Mater, I think his character is far more enjoyable than the dry and boring lightning mcqueen voiced by Owen Wilson who if you've seen one of his movies you've seen the character he acts out in every single movie he's been in. The animation in this movie was astounding. I graduated from college with a degree in video game art and design, I know first hand what goes into these kinds of pictures and Pixar has once again proved why they are the best 3D animation company out there. Their work is flawless. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone. I find it sad that people are reviewing this movie like its a educated thriller, take it for what it is - an entertaining family film. I brought my son and I don't know who enjoyed it more."

","How sad to rate this movie ""awful"" - but that's what it was. Really, I LOVE Pixar films - I even really liked Cars 1 - but this movie fails on so many levels.<br/><br/>I saw this movie with my husband and he's in agreement - Cars 2 was not good. It was too busy and loud, so many things going on at once it all just sort of blended together. The trusty and likable old characters were relegated to the back burner, leaving Mater and some unlikable new characters to carry the show. I didn't give a hoot about the new characters, the plot was convoluted and lame, and it just wasn't funny. Honestly, I may have laughed once or twice, but that was it! It wasn't really geared toward young children, and the other adults in the theater seemed to be as bored as we were. Half way through the movie I found myself thinking ""when is this thing gonna get better?"" Then answer was - never.<br/><br/>If you must see it, rent it and save yourself some money. Pixar - you owe us one for this stinker!"
"gregkeon","5","10","20","23 June 2011"," Parent's review - good for older kids and adults - bad for younger fans
","Cars 2 is a jarring sequel to Cars. While the first is a very sweet movie that charms viewers of all ages with its ""fish out of water"" story that explores the value of true friendship - the sequel is an espionage movie, with nods to James Bond, The Man Who Knew Too Much etc. It's full of guns, bombs, explosions, fighting etc. The plot is very complicated and involves an environmental message about alternative fuels. Many cars are ""killed"". It was a terrific movie for my 11 year old son (who loved it) but it really scared my 4 year old son - whose favourite movie is Cars. The script and visuals are clever as always (up to Pixar standards) but this film's intended audience does not seem to include Cars' youngest fans. I was slightly disappointed on behalf of the many young kids at our screening who idolize these characters. The film is more in line with the action and violence of The Incredibles which I loved but will not be showing my youngest until he is older. Parents be warned - probably more appropriate for 8 or 9 yr old children and up. Final note, the Toy Story short at the beginning was delightful. (I hope they don't mess up Monsters Inc. next year)"
"ced_yuen","Null","7","13","21 July 2011"," Pixar blows a tyre..
","'Cars 2' is preceded by 'Hawaiian Vacation', a short film set in the Toy Story universe. Despite the fact that 'Toy Story 3' was supposed to be the end of the franchise, Pixar seems reluctant to let go. It is not hard to see why - despite being only 6 minutes long, this appetiser manages to pack more Pixar magic than the main feature.<br/><br/>That is not to say that 'Cars 2' is a bad film. There are clever ideas, and moments of charm and wit, but the film does not spend enough time on them. As a result, the film fails to reach the lofty standards associated with Pixar.<br/><br/>At one point during its development, the film must have centred on a new story, with new characters. As the film opens, British secret agent Finn McMissile (Michael Caine, as a DB5) investigates a conspiracy involving alternative fuel, scaling an oil-drilling platform with magnetic tyres and grappling hooks.<br/><br/>The mood is one of intentional melodrama, simultaneously revering and ridiculing the adventures of 007. The sequence inevitably culminates in a car chase, and it is more thrilling and visually appealing than anything that EON has produced in recent years.<br/><br/>Things should have stayed that way, because 'Cars 2' is at its strongest when it has nothing to do with its predecessor. Alas, Finn McMissile becomes a secondary character, while the narrative returns to Radiator Springs. Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) accepts a challenge to participate in the World Grand Prix. Accompanying him is his best(est) buddy Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), whose bumbling misadventures become the overpowering flavour of the remaining 90 minutes.<br/><br/>It is here that the film blows a tyre. As a supporting character, Mater was fun and endearing. The hillbilly schtick came in small doses and served as effective comic relief. Placing him in the spotlight and trying to make him a hero, however, highlights the character's lack of depth. Jokes based on Mater's stupidity mostly consist of slapstick humour, which wears thin very quickly. What makes this worse is the decision to merge his storyline with that of Finn McMissile.<br/><br/>It is one thing to make a 'Cars' spin-off based on Mater, but quite another to combine a simple, child-oriented narrative with a more serious, sinister plot that, at one point, actually involves car-torture and car-assassination. The result is dissatisfactory, creating a jarring blend of the right things in the wrong proportions.<br/><br/>There is barely any solid racing, which unravels the foundations from the last film. There is not enough spy drama, which raises questions about the point of introducing the espionage element at all. On the other hand, there are many attempts to be funny, the success of which depends on the age of the viewer.<br/><br/>Ultimately, 'Cars 2' is a wasted opportunity. The Bond-inspired opening hinted at great things that were merely sprinkled throughout the film. It is a solid example of animation, but it does not feel like it is really part of the Pixar collection. Over the years Pixar has built up a reputation for films accessible to adults and children alike, and this is not one of them.<br/><br/>Children will no doubt have too much fun to notice the lack of sophistication, but adults used to the universal appeal of Pixar's standard fare will find this disappointing. 'Cars 2' is a fun film, but it is no 'Toy Story 3'."

","As a lover of Pixar, it pains this reviewer to say that Cars 2 represents PIXAR'S BIG STUMBLE. Those masters of Story - who managed to restore the animated feature to its former glory as Serious Entertainment for adults and kids, alike - have just walked out in public with their fly open. I hope they learn from this mistake, retrace their steps, and recapture the craft of Story that made their other films the instant classics that they are...<br/><br/>Saw it at the drive-in on a double billing with Green Lantern - it wasn't an Oscar-worthy night. The theme was clearly anti-petroleum - the director, John Lasseter, traded in the grand themes of Americana and our love affair with cars for....a spy story? starring Mater and not McQueen? with lots of shooting and bombs? and ""kid-friendly"" lines like ""KILL McQUEEN""? with Oil (the industry that, ironically, made our car- centric American lifestyle and culture possible) as the monolithically bad guy?<br/><br/>Where Cars 1 sometimes felt epic (remember those scenes of the painted desert landscapes of old Route 66 America?)- this one was noisy, rushed, and thin. Like being trapped inside a pinball machine for 90 minutes. The story felt ""small"" - worthy of the kind of straight-to-video fluff that Disney has been doing lately (e.g., Fox and The Hound 2). Instead of characterization, we got flatulence gags.<br/><br/>Oh, Pixar. Save the liberal politics for your private cocktail parties. Stop indulging yourselves at the expense of all of us regular folks who know full-well that solar panels, windmills, ethanol (a government- foisted conceit, which actually damages engines and causes grain shortages and price spikes as we burn food for fuel), etc., don't begin to approach the efficiency and power of petroleum. But that's all beside the point. We just came to be entertained, not to have our kids indoctrinated into your world-view, or for us adults to be lectured under the guise of ""entertainment.""<br/><br/>So, please, go back to basics, and all will be well. We still love Pixar."
"johnh1019-1","5","8","16","24 June 2011"," Two Words: No Heart
","Visually dizzying and emotionally empty, Cars 2 is an amazingly indulgent piece that seems to throw out the Pixar ""story"" book in favor of strained plot and graphic excess. Just because you can doesn't mean you should. This is reported to have started as a film-within-a-film from the first Cars, and perhaps it would have worked well as a longer short. As a feature, though, it lacks anyone to care about and any reason to care about them. And while it may be family-friendly in the broadest sense of the term, it is not for young children - some scenes are dismally intense, and the by-the-numbers plot will still lose them. I saw it with a 7- and 9-year-old, and they were not impressed. ""The first one was better"" was the general agreement. Lasseter and company should perhaps consider another Robert McKee seminar before moving forward with the Monsters Inc. sequel. Five stars out of 10 for 25 years of really great film making."
"judywalker2","4","7","14","27 June 2011"," The first misstep for Pixar
","I love Pixar movies and shorts and I enjoyed the first Cars. But I can honestly say that this is Pixar's first misstep. Let me start with the excessive violence that this movie presents. It's opening sequence alone makes me question some of the decisions Pixar make of this movie. The graphics continue to be stellar but the story is subpar and that's what we go to Pixar movies for. Also with Pixar their previous films are as entertaining for adults and children which is not the case for this story at all. It has too many adult themes and is kind of boring for children. Lastly this movie is preachy and lacks the usual heart found in previous Pixar films."
"spiderhulk95","6","7","14","24 June 2011"," Good, but Disappointing
","In the past two years, Pixar has had movies that were nominated for best picture awards. This year, they probably won't. Cars 2 is completely different than any other Pixar film, even Cars. It is not here to tell a story. It is here to just have a fun time at the theater. The first half of the movie is the best part, giving you the action and comedy expected from the trailers. After the first half, it seems to slow down and drag. Without a deep story, this seems like it was just made to keep up with the length of other Pixar films. The story contains mainly Mater, which isn't too much of a problem, but it does seem to get old after a little while. The racing is barely there, so it is like John Lasseter said, a spy movie with cars. As a Pixar fan, it disappointed. Even though Cars is my least favorite Pixar film, it was still good. This is at the same level, but nothing like Cars. There is almost no lesson learned from this. This a movie to enjoy, not a masterpiece like the rest of Pixar's films."
"peacedisturber","10","9","20","9 July 2011"," Good movie! Uplifting message for ALL!
","The first part of the comment is long and if you get tired of reading it, I understand, skip to the next part. But, there are some good points. <br/><br/>First, DO NOT DOWN RATE IT JUST BECAUSE IT WAS A PIXAR/Disney MOVIE WITH SPY ACTION AND GOT A 'G' RATING. Pixar/Disney is not responsible for the G rating. The MPAA is! I think it probably got a G rating for all of the intriguing and educational cultural subtleties and for some reason that's the way movies seemed to be rated. No sexual innuendos, no cursing (including the Lord's name in vain). Oliver! the Musical is a great example of an interesting G rated film. It has drug usage and theft all over it! Why is it rated G? Who knows? Anyway, if you are going to judge this movie based on: ""Well, it has too much violence for a family movie"" and not on its actual quality and without considering the really wholesome and uplifting messages then think about movies like 'The Incredibles', which has certain marital innuendos, plus more violence than Cars 2 AND more references to and scenes of death; think about ""Prince Caspian"", which CS Lewis in his books wrote for children around the ages of 6- 10, which has mild war scenes and scenes of betrayal and murder. They are movies which are wholesome which can be enjoyed and discussed by the ENTIRE family (maybe excepting really young ones). The ONLY difference is this: The two titles mentioned above involve people and not automobiles! Please don't kill good quality wholesome movies with your low ratings just because some MPAA people didn't give it a PG rating. And don't base your opinion of it based on whether it was appropriate for your 4 year old. Do you watch plenty of other movies that you don't let your children watch which actually contain swearing or violence or innuendos of any kind and like it and give it a good rating? If you don't want your kid watching CARS 2, then don't let them watch it till they're 8 or 9, that's all.<br/><br/>Second, it was a REALLY good quality movie with an amazing message and really witty and hilarious cross-cultural humor which is in no way offensive. It has a really good message about friendship and not putting others down and calling them stupid (PERFECT MESSAGE FOR FIRST GRADERS!) and that everyone has some type of special ability or talent or knowledge and is vital to completing a mission. <br/><br/>Third, I was surprised at first when I heard they were making a sequel to Cars. I mean, what more could they do with the plot if it is only about racing? McQueen already learned his lesson about not being boastful. I was pleasantly surprised to how they shifted the attention to the supposed idiot and turn him into a hero and conveys, once again, the message that anyone can be a hero. <br/><br/>I loved it! Everyone that has seen it with me loved it! I spoke with a guy in the theater who could probably relate to Mater's story, someone who probably seems to be an idiot and who is disabled. He excitedly told me that it was his third time watching the film. I could see that Mater was the hero with whom he could relate. I am sure that there are a lot of kids who may feel out of place at school and they can relate with Mater's story. Perhaps that is why it is rated-G, so that kids can learn at an early age those wonderful lessons as well as gain a deep appreciation for cultural diversity. <br/><br/>(Again, if you really don't want your children to watch it, then that's fine. But, don't give a less-than-deserved low rating for it not meeting your idea criteria of a rated G movie.)"
"XntriX","Null","6","12","5 August 2011"," Fails to deliver
","I begin with a quote from John Lasseter, the movie director: Let me tell you a funny story. I took the family to see this film one weekend - I'll go to see almost any film that's good for the whole family. And so we're sitting there watching this film, which I won't name, and there are long stretches that are just not very entertaining. My little son - he was probably 6 at the time - was sitting next to me, and right in the middle of this dull section, he turns to me and says, ""Dad? How many letters are in my name?"" I must have laughed for five minutes. I thought, Oh, man, this movie has lost this little boy. His mind has been wandering, trying to figure out how many letters there are in his name. So I told my wife, Nancy, what he said, and she started laughing, and then the story went down the row through my whole family, our four other sons, and we're sitting there as a family giggling and laughing. And I thought to myself, If ever a child anywhere in the world leans over to their daddy during one of my movies and asks, ""How many letters are in my name?"" I'll quit.<br/><br/>John Lasseter's job is as safe as ever. Cars 2 will not give children the time to think for themselves.<br/><br/>The constant rapid action sequence, illogical plot, double meaning punch jokes that are not very funny even for an adult, and primarily no strongly developed character with which to identify will leave children and adults confused just enough to prevent them from considering number and letters in their names.<br/><br/>What a difference from the original Cars. Cashing in on the merchandising success of a great original story developed with sensibility for strong character, relationship development, outsider inclusion, Cars 2 feels like a feature length commercial.<br/><br/>Financially, it will be a success. Because it seems to be its primary objective. Entertainment value ? Perhaps for those attracted to mindless exploitation of the few low common denominators that seem to work on a certain relatively high percentage of viewership: SFX, chase, shootings, fire, blowups, wow-effect. Perfect for a constant gratification bred viewer. Good storytelling ? Who needs good storytelling anymore... well, the kids do.<br/><br/>Joe Ranft had it figured out, and has delivered, what a great talent and what a loss, even more apparent now, after release of Cars 2.<br/><br/>Cars 2 is a major disappointment on many fronts. The expectations were high after Cars 1, and such a long long wait, I must admit. But to give up on even trying to get close to the beauty of Cars 1, that is unforgivable. Shame."

Little gems such as Mater's ""He did WHAT in his cup?"" were not there to add the adult humour to the film and a running time of near on 2 hours meant my friend's (nearly) 4 year old was bored nearly to tears by then end of it! In my opinion Disney / Pixar have left it FAR too long to bring out a sequel, a sequel that should, in fact have never been made as there have been other films since that are significantly better. It lacks the depth of Toy Story (in as much as a kid's film can have depth) and the likability of Monster's Inc - it also lacks the ""aww"" factor of ""Up"" and felt to me as if Pixar were trying too hard to make something to suit all ages and failed in the process. Although Cars 2 is funny in parts, it is in NO way as good as previous Pixar treats and I was sorely disappointed, as was my friend's little boy who LOVED Cars so much my best friend and I were almost ready to buy shares in merchandising for it! I do hope this is not the start of a company who have made some real gems just battering out any old tosh to keep the money coming in!"

"puffball97","1","9","21","26 June 2011"," The First Worst Movie Pixar Has Ever Brought In
","Up until now, Pixar could do no wrong. Hopefully, this will be both the first and last time with ""Cars 2."" Pixar has so far been the best animated studio for the last 15 years or so, and has never delivered a bad movie even once. They don't resort to pop culture references and star egos like Dreamworks has around the same time. But then, even Pixar hasn't been intact with ""Cars 2."" With this movie, the studio is condescending to the level of Dreamworks also with pop culture and star egos, not to mention a confusing storyline that can baffle the young ones. Still no matter how bad the reviews, and I'm agreeing with them,the movie will rake in business like any other animated movie from the 1990s on.<br/><br/>What is wrong with this movie? Where can I begin? Well, first of all, the story borrows and rips off the James Bond movies during the Sean Connery era. Although Michael Caine has never been James Bond, he is sure suave and reliable enough to play any British spy, animated or live action. He definitely is the perfect fit as the British secret agent car Finn McMissile. His part is good enough, but he doesn't seem to intertwine with two of the original ""Cars,"" the hero Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) or the redneck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), who now upstages McQueen as the hero. Mater has the role as an unwitting agent and is foil to Finn McMissile and his sleek female assistant Holley Shiftwell (The British actress Emily Mortimer), and even falls for her at the end of the movie. Still nothing of interest. <br/><br/>Second, the story is way too confusing. It's all about greed of the oil supply. The villain is Sir Miles Axelrod (Eddie Izzard), who wants to replace all of the gas oil with synthetic oils so cars can use it in a World Grand Prix in Tokyo, Paris, Monte Carlo, and London. There are even offensive jokes about the Italian mafia, something never done in Pixar before, and Pixar usually has kind, sensitive humor. Mater, Finn McMissile, and Holley Shiftwell join forces to thwart this dastardly attempt and restore the oil to its normalcy, while Lightning McQueen races against a new Italian Rival Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro).<br/><br/>Third and most important of all, it is rated G, and with all the frightening gunplay and violence, and literal bathroom humor, it should be rated PG. Some people would suggest it should be PG-13. Back in the day, there were numerous G-rated cartoons that should have been rated PG, and PG-rated cartoons that should be rated R. ""Cars 2"" is no exception to the inaccurate ratings of animated movies. <br/><br/>The only good things about the movie are the colorful artwork, especially in the Tokyo sequences, and the addition of other characters besides cars, such as submarines and a smiling plane named Siddeley, McMissile's espionage partner.<br/><br/>I'm so glad I didn't bring any small children to this movie. There were no laughs in the audiences and the children came out of there asking their parents, ""What's it all about?"" Original characters come back in smaller cameos, but their scenes really had no place in the movie. The actor doing Fillmore did a lame imitation of George Carlin, who died three years ago. Luckily, Doc Hudson, played by the late great Paul Newman, wasn't replaced, he had a small tribute. If ""Cars 2"" had the same type of endearing storyline like let's say, ""Toy Story 2,"" or ""Toy Story 3,"" adults would have been fine with it. But no, it had to be like any routine animated movie from other studios. Hopefully, Pixar in the future will go back to it's usual style again because there is an adult audience for animation."

"djansen24","5","3","5","27 November 2011"," This should have been a Dreamworks picture, not Pixar!
","Cars 2 is the latest offering by Pixar, the only studio I am aware of that up until now has had a perfect running of first rate films. Cars 2 is finally where the studio giant Pixar takes a big downturn in quality. Don't get me wrong. It is not a horrible film. It has several things working for it, such as creativity and absolutely dazzling animation, but it lacks a story with resonance. The original Cars was a slow grower for me, a movie that got better with each viewing. That is because it had a story with heart, characters you cared about, and a flat out brilliant ending. But everything here works only on the surface. I didn't like the excessiveness of Toy Story 3, Pixar's giant last year, but that still very good film gave screen time to all of the characters we loved and had many moments that were simply magic. There is none of that here, so you're pretty much stuck with an action packed spy movie (a violent one at that - no small kids should watch this one). Mater replaces McQueen as the lead (an unfortunate decision, as a little bit of Mater goes a looong way! That's why he is so much better suited for the short Mater's Tall Tales animated shorts.). McQueen makes a splash on the screen here and there, and that's it. Luigi, Guido, Doc, Flo, Ramone, Red, Sally, Model-T, and Mac get almost no face time and their dialogue is really useless. The plot has twists and turns and ends up being pretty ludicrous. The new characters have no depth to them whatsoever, the only slightly amusing one is Francesco, played by the great John Turturro. Even the stunning international setting of the movie is treated rather haphazardly. We are delighted for a few seconds by beautiful world cities only to have the awe and beauty pulled out from under our feet a few seconds later. Even the race is meaningless to the story. And so it is all spy movie, an average one at that. One can't help but think that Pixar for some weird reason was eager to make another Cars film just to rake in the toy merchandise sales later. They should stop having john Lasseter direct the films. Of all the films, his (with the exception of Toy Story and Toy Story 2) are the weakest. They've got Stanton, Docteur, and Bird who are all fantastic filmmakers and storytellers. And please, get a story that transcends the medium, not plays down to the audience! <br/><br/>So all in all, Cars 2 is a slick, competent, and somewhat boring picture. It reminded me of watching a Dreamworks cartoon. A few chuckles, a few okay moments, and then ho-hum... Average at best. Shouldn't carry the Pixar name..."

","""Cars 2"" is the sequel to ""Cars"" (well, duh). The only thing is, the two movies are hardly related to each other. In ""Cars"", Lightning McQueen, a spoiled hotshot race car, discovers the meaning of true family and friendship. In ""Cars 2"", the story focuses on Mater (McQueen's best friend) and how he somehow gets caught up in a spy mission.<br/><br/>I was prepared for disappointment, considering all the reviews that I heard. But I was really surprised! ""Cars 2"" was very enjoyable! The humor was funny and the action was great! I did like the plot. It sort of reminded me of a real James Bond film. Who knew talking cars and an action/mystery genre could work?<br/><br/>Most of the reasons that people didn't like this film was because this sequel wasn't related to ""Cars"" at all. But if the first film wasn't considered, then people would find that ""Cars 2"" is actually be a pretty good movie! But to be honest, I think that I would have liked this movie more if it was a new original Pixar movie, not just a sequel to ""Cars"".<br/><br/>While watching this, just forget about ""Cars"" for a while and enjoy the humor and action that ""Cars 2"" gives. Pixar still did good!<br/><br/>Viewed on: August 29, 2011"

","Cars 1 was a great movie. It had a great story and it touched on characters that you grew to love as the movie went on. Cars 2... Not so much.<br/><br/>Story - This one really stars Matter, with all others being part of his story for the most part. Instead of being grounded within Radiator Springs, we find a the familiar characters we know rolling around Europe.<br/><br/>The whole movie is a pseudo James Bond spy film with slapstick thrown in. In no way would I have expected this type of story to make up a Cars movie but that's the direction it went in. There was nothing to make this film truly stand out. The additional characters seemed hurried when compared to the first movie. Sort of a toss in without any back story. I am more then sure that a better story could have been done and it should have been really.<br/><br/>Video/Audio - In general Pixar fashion the movie looks great and sound is also great. There is nothing to complain about as you know what to expect after years of watching fine quality computer animation at work.<br/><br/>Acting - Can't really rate this as easily as other movies. It is voice acting after all, but in saying that it delivers what you expect. Again, Pixar sets bars for others to strive towards.<br/><br/>Overall - This is a great movie for kids, they will love whats going on screen and will love the comedy. As an adult you can easily miss this one and not worry if your missing on something special. The movie is not bad so much as it simply doesn't live up to the first. Then again few movies do."

","Starting where the previous one left of we meet Lightning McQueen completely settled and living in Radiator Springs. Life is good - there's racing events to be won and the company of friends to be enjoyed. During a race event in Japan the wheels of fate are set in motion and McQueen and Mater end up in what can only be described as a cloak and dagger operation. So far for the story.<br/><br/>Animation wise there's nothing too wrong with this film - the style is much the same as the first one. Most of the scenes are busy - there's always something to look at, some detail to pick out. Story wise I felt the film was aimed at an audience a bit older than the one for the previous film although the number of young kids in the theatre enjoying themselves proved it didn't matter.<br/><br/>3D effects were far under the expectancy level for an animation film. I don't think anyone would miss them if they weren't there at all and that makes this film another proof that the 3D addition to film is one that is to be worked at some more or removed completely.<br/><br/>All in all it is a fairly enjoyable film with a good number of cultural effects and lots of laughs.<br/><br/>6 out of 10 sources of intelligence"
"diac228","5","3","5","1 July 2011"," After many home runs, Pixar finally strikes out.
","Pixar is arguably the last remaining film company with a perfect track record. From Toy Story to Toy Story 3, each of their films had been met with grand acclaim and multiple Academy Awards. However, I can safely say the perfect track record ends this month. Cars 2 is a bafflingly disappointing movie that tastes even more bitter since its coming from Pixar, the makers of the best computer-animated films of all-time. Everything that has made Pixar movies range from decent to incredible to perfect was neglected here: from the mediocre script, to the lack of heart, to the lack of humor, right down to even commercializing their film a bit with some awkward product placements and a multitude of new characters that provide nothing more than just providing more toys to sell. Cars 2 was totally unnecessary, and just didn't deliver in any way shape or form---except for the animation.<br/><br/>In Cars 2, we have this bizarre spy plot weaving in with a grand prix championship that takes place around the world. Without spoiling too much, there is a conspiracy going on throughout the grand prix and Tom Mater is sent on a mission to uncover who it might be. At the same time, it loosely threatens his relationship with Lightning. In terms of script, this was by far the weakest because there was no character development, minimal true conflict, no surprises, and it absolutely contradicts the lessons (mildly) learned in the original Cars movie. This movie was made purely for the kids as it offers very little subtle adult humor aside from all the snarly vehicle references.<br/><br/>I will never understand why Pixar felt the need to create this movie whose only purpose was to make money and merchandise the heck out of it. You would think after billions of dollars in revenue with original and clever stories it would be enough to keep their creative juices flowing while at the same time deliver a profit for Disney. But this film was easy to market, easy to distribute. And with that comes laziness, and it was all-too prevalent here. Cars was the film least necessary in the Pixar lineup to warrant a sequel, prequel, whatever. Just the fact that Pixar drove a movie just for profit sake heavily tarnished their credibility as an animation studio that e used to believe was focused in telling great stories in multiple ways.<br/><br/>Let's at least focus a bit on the positive. The voice cast was all back (with the exception of George Carlin and Paul Newman, of course) and with a few new voices in the mix. For the most part they did a good job, even though some didn't have much to work with, incredibly Owen Wilson as the main character Lightning being the main example. The animation was stunningly beautiful, but what else do you expect from Pixar? They are leagues ahead of the next-best animation studio, as their vehicles and settings were detailed down to a T. The action scenes were well-drawn out and have better cinematography as the typical action flick.<br/><br/>And now we shall go back to complaining. The movie felt a lot like Speed Racer: it was a decent racing movie but had a plot too convoluted for children, yet had a premise that was appealing mostly to the kids. Cars 2 suffers from this same fate, it has a spy storyline that complicates itself to a point in which the kids will be utterly lost, but still doesn't have the feel of a movie that the entire family can enjoy—its more a movie for younger boys, who will be utterly lost once the second act kicks in. The movie also doesn't dwell into deeper adult themes like previous Pixar movies like Toy Story 3, Up, and (especially) The Incredibles.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Cars 2 is Pixar's first disappointment, and it hurts so much more because we know what the studio is capable of. What baffles me the most is the sheer minimal amount of effort to continue the trend and tradition of the preceding Pixar movies. Much like what happened with Indiana Jones 4 (which to this day I deny it exists), it deviated so badly from the formula of success that any strength it may have had is deterred by the fact that.we have seen so much better from that same staff. Cars 2 was pointless, redundant, lifeless, and just nothing like what we are used to seeing.<br/><br/>The original was subtly hinted to be a pet project of Pixar's leader John Lasseter, and the only reason we are even seeing a sequel is because its Lasseter's pet and because merchandise sales were the greatest for Disney since 1994's The Lion King. Let's hope this is just a speed bump and not a downward spiral, because I would hate to see less Up-quality films and more Cars 2-quality flicks. Maybe this will be a wake-up call for the company--especially if they don't win the Best Animated Film Oscar next year. In the meantime, prepare for a snorefest if you are dragged to watch this. Pixar, you finally flopped. Took 25 years and countless good memories, but it has happened."
"thekyles99","7","3","5","28 June 2011"," Another great visit to Radiator Springs and other places!
","I like these Cars movies and this one was just as good if not a tad better than the original! This time the directors John Lasseter and Brad Lewis bring a few new characters to the mix as in Francesco (an indy type car) who after Mater's ( this time voiced by Larry The Cable Guy) bating challenges Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) to race him in a championship race in his home country of Italy. Also new to the mix are Pixar's version of James Bond's 007, Finn Mcmissile (Michael Caine) and M Holly Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) two British top super spies who find unknown and very hidden espionage talents within Mater's rusty parts. This second visiting with all the folks of Radiator Springs, brings us more of Mater then Lightning, which some have found annoying, i remember reading one critics review in which he wrote that Pixar had found their very own Jar Jar Binks. Well I for one like the Mater character and found he along with the little forklift that assists him at the garage only adds to the laughs. If you and your family loved the first one then you will definitely love this one as well. I love all the Pixar films and always say bravo to them upon every review!"
"Ilovetoreadade","10","4","8","25 June 2011"," Wonderful movie!!
","To those who don't think it follows the storyline from the first movie. IN the first movie McQueen races 2nd movie McQueen races! Yes there are spies but this movie is wonderful and there are unexpected surprises and yes it's different then normal Pixar movies but that's why is was an excellent movie for me!!! It's a great film to see and unlike other movies you don't really need to see the first Cars to understand this one. If you want to better understand the relationship between Mater and McQueen then yes watch the first movie but this movie was hilarious, fun to watch, and even more a fun way to celebrate a friends birthday. If there's a movie you want to watch to see some action, comedy, and a minor bit of romance this is the movie to watch because it wonderfully executes all qualities of those 3 genres. I loved it and my friend loved and when I heard that there were bad reviews I was shocked, this is a movie to see this Summer."
"jmcinty-90-600122","7","4","8","25 June 2011"," I liked it
","I had a lot of fun watching this movie. One of things that has bothered me about many reviewers is that the didn't like Cars to begin with and if that is you than you probably won't like Cars 2. I personally don't understand why people do not like Cars but comparing the two movies, which is what people usually do when they review sequels, they are on same level. I personally like the spy car theme as car chases are prominent in many spy movies. I do not think it is a far cry from the first movie, radiator springs is not forgotten it is just worked into McQueen's life. On the Pixar scale I put it above A Bugs Life, which is my least favorite of the Pixar movies. In the end it is still a Pixar movie, worth watching, and far better than most of the movies in the theaters right now."
"IllusionOfLife","7","4","8","25 June 2011"," Disappointing, But By No Means Bad
","So this is a hard review to write. On one hand, Cars 2 is better than 95% of what any other animation studio is putting out (that five percent is home to the odd DreamWorks movie that is actually great like How to Train Your Dragon, and one-off successes from great filmmakers like Henry Selick's ""Coraline"" and Gore Verbinski's ""Rango""), but on the other hand it's a significant step down from the excellence bordering on perfection we've come to expect from Pixar. True, a step down from excellence is still good, but considering the pedigree it's somewhat disappointing; therein lies my quandary. <br/><br/>Cars 2 tells a broader story than the original Cars, taking place in many locales across four different countries. In Cars 2 Lightning McQueen has just come back from a Piston Cup race and is getting ready to settle down after the end of Racing Season, but all the while invitations are being sent for a World Grand Prix, a tournament across three different countries featuring the world's best racers and McQueen is invited. He takes Mater along for the ride and through a series of coincidences Mater eventually gets mistaken for an American Spy by British Intelligence Agent Finn McMissile (think James Bond voiced by Michael Caine). High speed races and spy movie action set pieces ensue, and there are many fun moments and good laughs along the way. The visuals are stunning, as are to be expected with Pixar, and the voice work is just as wonderful as it always is in a Pixar film (Michael Caine absolutely steals the show). However, there are elements that hold it back from greatness. <br/><br/>The whole affair feels very safe and almost unambitious, there's nothing in the film that really wowed me and while I enjoyed myself the movie never really gripped me like other Pixar films do. As a member of the audience, I felt like I was just watching a movie rather than being caught up in a story, the characters were fun, but I never connected with them in the same way I've connected with Woody, Marlin, Flik, Carl Fredricksen, or WALL-E; I didn't even connect with Lightning McQueen or Mater in the same way I did in the first film. They were entertaining characters, but they just didn't have that same spark of life that makes them feel real. It didn't have the same magic that I've come to expect from Pixar. <br/><br/>Again, this is my problem. Looking at what I've written, I keep comparing it to other Pixar films and not looking at it on its own merit. It doesn't necessarily seem right to hold Cars 2 accountable for Toy Story 2, Ratatouille, and WALLE; completely on its own merit Cars 2 is a fun, entertaining film with great visuals and good characters. I can think of much worse ways to spend a Friday night, and I would definitely be willing to see it again. However, that comparison is inevitable due to the fact that Pixar has established such a strong precedent of not just quality, but excellence over the past 25 years. As a follow up to 11 of the best films of the past decade and a half, it's a bit of a letdown. It is by no means a bad film, and the current Tomatometer rating it has is an absolute travesty. Pixar's reputation has not been tarnished and they're still, by far, the best studio in Hollywood. <br/><br/>Even though Cars 2 is a bit of a disappointment, I think it's probably healthy for the studio. I was discussing it with my dad and he brought up the point that working under the pressure of your audience expecting a masterpiece every single year must be a nightmare, and while Cars 2 is disappointing, the fact that Pixar released a film that's just good instead of great gives them some more room to breathe. The critics have had their chance to give Pixar hell (and I'm sure there were many who were eagerly awaiting such an opportunity) and Pixar was able to make a film that didn't need to be a masterpiece to be entertaining. <br/><br/>So now I've got to put an actual score on this thing. Ergh- I was dreading this moment... I'm going to cheat a little bit here and give this film two scores, one accounting for Pixar's history and the expectations that brings with it, and one that does not. So treating Cars 2 as the followup to Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Cars, Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up, and Toy Story 3, Cars 2 gets a: <br/><br/>C+ <br/><br/>Now, judging Cars 2 completely by itself, without the legacy of Pixar as a factor it earns a: <br/><br/>B"

It is usually assumed that the sequel - a rather bitter word, since they are unsuccessful, try to go to the past glory of parts, and just a quickie. I can not say the same about this cartoon, but still the first part was better.

Although it's too bad, the summer after all.<br/><br/>Interesting question, I came almost immediately after the start of the session. Lightning McQueen took command of the first part of the finals for only one race? Now it has different mechanics or just dub is not quite correct? And yes, sad news for fans of Doc Hudson, undefeated, it will not. Why, you will learn in the first five minutes of the film. To be honest, I was hoping to continue to see plenty of racing, as in the first part I did not have them, and ""lucky"" they are really more. On the whole one. Well, what do you want from the spy thriller? Secret spy gadgets, shooting, car chases, explosions and even murder. But not racing. I even remember Rush Hour (tour of Japan), and the film Johnny Inglish (almost all of the master, including the final). Incidentally, in the cinema around me (and many before me, and after, both the left and right) were children of kindergarten age 5-6. And they did not like. Not a children's cartoon apparently unsuccessful, although a lot of funny moments.<br/><br/>The quality of pictures can say a lot, but why? After all, it's Pixar and Disney, they are always on top. The scenario is not taken out, but the picture is simply amazing. Soundtrack matched perfectly. It is mainly noticeable in the scenes of battles and races, which is quite natural and logical. But it also happens in quiet moments, the music makes the astonishing skill of composers.<br/><br/>As a result, for an incredible picture, sparkling humor, spy gadgets and a good soundtrack put a solid seven.<br/><br/>ps: in the credits is a special thanks to Steve Jobs, I wonder what he did?"

","The first film from Disney and Pixar was good fun, I may not have originally thought of watching it, but I'm glad I did, and I was certainly looking forward to seeing whether the sequel would be as much fun as the original, especially after seeing a couple of trailers for it. Basically, back in the world where cars are the population, there is a spy plot, where British secret agent Finn McMissile (Sir Michael Caine) has gathered some information of suspicious oil reserves, and he needs an undercover agent to join him and his assistant Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) in the mission to see what's going on. Meanwhile, Piston Cup four-time racing champion Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has returned to Radiator Springs, and he has got himself a place to race in the World Grand Prix, thanks to his good friend Mater (Larry the Cable Guy). The event is to promote Allinol biofuel, being promoted by green power advocate Sir Miles Axlerod (Eddie Izzard), and the race goes to Tokyo where McQueen will go against his challenge Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro). Originally American spy Rod 'Torque' Redline (Bruce Campbell) was meant to be completing the spy mission, but he is compromised by the henchmen of Professor Zündapp (a Zündapp Janus 250) (Thomas Kretschmann), but he manages to pass the gathered information onto Mater, so the British spies mistake him as their contact, and while racing McQueen overhears their conversation and is distracted in the race to lose. The next race moves to Italy, and Mater has fallen out with McQueen, and McMissile and Shiftwell tell him everything they know so that he will carry out their mission, to investigate Allinol biofuel, which has been suspended for the final race in England, but McQueen is still using it despite this. After getting the British spies into trouble Mater realises his foolishness at times, and he has to save his friend when there is an assassination plot, involving a bomb that will detonate if he gets too close to his friend, but it was not Zündapp who set the bomb. Eventually as the bomb countdown clock nears the point of explosion the true lead villain reveals himself as the one who can deactivate it, Axlerod is the mastermind, and in the end he and his whole organisation are arrested, Mater gets a knighthood from the The Queen (a Rolls Royce Phantom) (Vanessa Redgrave) and a date with Shiftwell, and he and McQueen have fun racing in various places around the world. Also starring Bonnie Hunt as Sally (a 2002 Porsche 911 Carrera), Cheech Marin as Ramone (1959 Chevrolet Impala Lowrider), John Ratzenberger as Mack (1985 Mack Super-Liner), Jason Isaacs as Siddeley, Tony Shalhoub as Luigi (a 1959 Fiat 500), Lewis Hamilton, Joe Mantegna as Grem (an AMC Gremlin), Peter Jacobson as Acer (an AMC Pacer), Brent Musburger as Brent Mustangburger, Richard Kind as Van and John Lasseter as John Lassetire (a Chevrolet S-10 pickup truck). The voice casting is still as good as before, there are certainly more recognisable talents and cameos, including new additions Caine and Mortimer adding some intrigue, the story is a little wonky and sometimes too much to get used to, but the James Bond style stuff is fun enough, the characters are all likable, especially Mater who gets a more starring role, it may not be as much of a highlight as the first film, but for the family it is an alright animated comedy. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film. Worth watching!"

","I'm a Disney addict, anything Disney you throw at me, I'm usually a happy camper. But when Disney and Pixar teamed up, it was like peanut butter and chocolate. These two teams belonged together and it seems like they were the only movie company releasing competent films. Only film I wasn't crazy about was Cars, it's one of those movies that everyone seemed to love that I wasn't falling for. Not to say it was a bad movie, it was good, but the plot really didn't get to me and the animation was good, but nothing spectacular. But apparently it was popular enough to get a sequel, which I have to admit baffled me, but I like to give movies a fair chance. I decided to wait to watch it at home though and actually I'm glad. This movie is a straight to DVD story with a bigger budget.<br/><br/>British spy Finn McMissile infiltrates the world's largest untapped oil reserves, owned by a group of ""lemon"" cars. After being discovered, he is forced to flee and fake his death. Piston Cup champion race car Lightning McQueen returns home to Radiator Springs and reunites with his best friend Mater. When Italian formula race car Francesco Bernoulli challenges McQueen, McQueen and Mater depart to Tokyo, Japan for the Grand Prix. Meanwhile, the lemons, led by Professor Zündapp and Master mind, secretly plot to secure their oil profits by using a weapon disguised as a television camera to ignite the Allinol fuel. McMissile and partner Holley Shiftwell attempt to rendezvous with American spy car at a World Grand Prix promotional event in Tokyo to receive information about the mastermind; Shiftwell and McMissile mistake Mater as their American contact. Now they use Mater to find out the information that could possibly kill McQueen.<br/><br/>The things that are good with this movie is that the animation is very sleek and shiny, it looks very beautiful. Some of the sight gags are clever, especially when they are in Japan. Some of the voice actors really give a good performance like Michael Caine. But the spy story has been done a million times. Not to say since this is a kid's film, it's new to them, but that means it's specifically for the children and not for the adults. Also the one thing I did kind of like from the first Cars movie was Mater. Usually the side characters are the one's who steal the show in an animated movie and Mater was charming and funny. So naturally like most sequels, they take the most popular character and exploit the heck out of them. The title should have been ""Cars 2: Mater's Adventure"" with the way they were going. Not to sound mean, but every time that Mater gets his feelings get hurt, honestly I don't really feel that bad for him. I wonder why it took him actually so long to realize that he's an idiot. It's like the Urkel factor, cue the sad music with his sad face and we are supposed to feel bad for him despite the fact that he's the one causing the chaos. I just didn't find anything too charming about this movie. I'd recommend it just as a rental at home as it is pretty to look at and will entertain the kids. But it would've been better if they just released it straight to video considering the budget that went into it that could've made 5 better movies. <br/><br/>5/10"

The film is an animation and is supposed to cater for the taste of younger children. The plot is far to confusing, with sexual references and violence.<br/><br/>My personal suggestion for a sequel would have been to have a tamer road movie based on the Cannon ball run, or the Smokey and the Bandit movies... or we could have had Ligtning McQueen and Mater get car-napped and shipped off across the world ...etc..,"

","As we all know, this movie became the worst movie Pixar has ever made. In the commentary, John Lassiter said that he has always wanted to make a spy movie. Really? Than why didn't he thought about making a original Pixar movie on that instead of using that as a sequel to Cars? To this day, there hasn't been a Pixar movie that hasn't been bad as this and I think it should stay that way. This is a good example of a movie that was made for merchandise only, I mean I remember seeing merchandise based on this movie everywhere and it is ridicules. The part that seems to bother me the most is Holly Shiftwale became half plane towards the end of the movie, why didn't she become half plane from the beginning? Now let's all agree that Pixar learned their lesson and will never make a movie as bad as this, hopefully. I mean, look at Cars 3, it proves how much they learned from their mistakes and to me, Cars 3 is the true sequel to the first Cars movie and not this terrible sequel."

","Instalment two of the lightning quick, ferociously outrageous, family orientated Cars franchise sees Lighting McQueen (Owen Wilson) and his compatriot Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) come together again to compete, but on a slightly, only somewhat generously proportioned scale, in a World Grand Prix race. The road to success in this outing concentrates the majority of its filming on Mater. Whilst attempting to support his best buddy racer McQueen we see the productive pick-up truck becoming distracted by a top secret covert mission: international surveillance, hired by Finn McMissile (Michael Caine).<br/><br/>With a new adventure on the cards for the lovable duo beyond the South-western desert of Radiator Springs, Mater and McQueen embark on a perilous journey of cooperation, a break-up and an identity crisis. The protagonist role takes a twist with Mater being registered as the hero in place of McQueen. Although McQueen is recognised for his high speed chases around the globe, Mater's role sees the dusty, rusty articulated vehicle bind all the pieces together giving this second addition of the Cars franchise a heart-warming appeal that all the family will draw an ounce of pleasure from. With an incursion of a number of opposing rivals including Francesco Bernoulli, played by John Turturro, this version will certainly tamper with the nerves, but since when hasn't Pixar taken us aboard its roller-coaster of adventure.<br/><br/>Pixar never seems to disappoint, providing consistent and successful family entertainment that children will solicit for parents to take them to the movies. Once the credits role they'll be accelerating out of the screen deeming themselves to be a metaphor racer of Lightning McQueen and finally, ultimately requesting for the merchandise products to re-enact the movie. Whether Cars 2 topples the first instalment, Cars, only audiences will determine. It cannot be denied that Pixar is consistent and they'll be more to follow."

My friends all said it was bad because they focused a bit too much on the ""go to electric and save the Earth"" stuff the save-the-earth people love to go on about. My friend never mentioned the fact that it was just a predictable plot for the most part with a few funny moments but that's about it.<br/><br/>The only real thing that kept me interested and that I thought was cool were the gadgets and how the spies used them to their advantage. And the few gags that came with Mater's speech.<br/><br/>Other than that, it wasn't really as good as it could have been. Many feel it's a evil ploy to get people to buy more toys. But I think it's just a bad year for Pixar in 2011. They are human and capable of making mistakes.

","I like the direction Pixar decided to go with Cars 2. Turning it into a globe-trotting spy flick is a fun and interesting way to continue the story without having to retread anything that happened in the first movie. <br/><br/>With that said, I am not a fan of Mater, and the fact that he's essentially the main character of the movie is not exactly my cup of tea. I can completely understand how kiddos love him and find him hilarious, but he annoys me to no end. So, as much as I enjoyed some parts of Cars 2 (including the addition of Emily Mortimer, who automatically makes anything better), I can't say I'll be eager to see it again soon. It's bright, vivid and looks amazing, and there's a nice little story of being true to oneself at the heart of it, but the Mater overload is just too much for me. <br/><br/>Cars 2 can't compare to the best Pixar has to offer, but there's a 99.99% chance that there's a young one in your life that will have a blast watching it (and playing with the toys that you're inevitably going to have to purchase afterwards)."

","Not sure why people are so negative about this one. The movie is very fun, lively and entertaining. It seems that some people just hated Mater in the first movie (probably b/c they hate Larry the Cable Guy) and so were dead set against a movie centering on that character. Myself, I didn't even know who Larry the Cable Guy was, so I was always able to appreciate the Mater character without the filter of some apparently irritating actor behind the scenes. Mater was my favorite character from Cars, so I was delighted to see that Cars 2 made him the star. I loved the message of this movie: that everyone has something special to offer and anyone can be a hero. That the guy who looks and sounds like a goofy hick might have a lot more going on ""under the hood"" than people will give him or her credit for. And McQueen continues to learn important lessons about humility and friendship that he still didn't quite master in the first Cars, so that's all good as well. I have no idea what so many of the reviewers here have against this movie. It is very well made, extremely entertaining and the ""violence"" is hardly anything to worry about in this day and age. It's full of fun, humor and energy. The score is excellent, and animation superb. My kids (8,6,3) have watched it a dozen times at least and they are still enthralled."

","For Pixar fans, the adults anyways the ""Cars"" franchise is viewed as the worst, at least in the online world but that's beside the point, can a film that is a sequel to this ""terrible"" franchise really be all that great, this film will likely surprise you.<br/><br/>The Film's score is effective and well done, it feels like a spy movie score which is great in setting the mood. It easily ranks among the top Pixar films when it comes to this area, you'd have to really hate this series with a passion to even hate this score.<br/><br/>The animation is of course fantastic, anything that can reflect WILL reflect. The action is put to no shame thanks to this as well and may provide more fun than other films of this year.<br/><br/>The voice-cast includes everyone, minus a select few (the ones that died of course) from Radiator Springs from the original. They have little to say which is a downside, but another change from the first is Mater leading this film, he provides the same level of humor from the original and actually becomes the better lead for the film as he brings a different kind of personality to the past Pixar leads (McQueen was Woody just in car form to be honest) he's a lovable goof which may feel reminiscent of classic comedies. New characters include spies who provide a lot more interest to the film without making it feel like a different film (this film's race and spy plots really collide greatly and make for a better film overall) with all the violence that will surely get the older crowds attention. New racers are added to the mix, or racer as John Turturro as Francesco Bernoulli will steal pretty much any scene he's in.<br/><br/>The story is fantastic and filled with the classic spy element that fans of the genre will love and likely will want this film to be the intro to their children to the genre. It's hard not to love this fast paced sequel (though critics may say otherwise just because it's not ""Pixar good"") that improves on the original in so many ways.<br/><br/>""Cars 2"" may not be emotional but that's no problem it's a fun film for all ages that feels committed to it's story and doesn't talk down to it's audience, watch it."
"DICK STEEL","Null","1","1","27 August 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Cars 2
","Pixar had always treaded carefully when it came to follow up films, with only Toy Story getting the honor given its established fan base, and soon, Monsters Inc getting a prequel as well. As to why Cars warranted a second film would be anyone's guess, but I suppose the story allowed some bandwidth to break out of the small town of Radiator Springs and into the big leagues of an international racing circuit to the tune of a lot more merchandise and toys to make money from, that it perhaps proved to be irresistible.<br/><br/>The idea is a no brainer, since there's F, the World Rally Series and others to tap more ideas from, that the story by John Lasseter, Brad Lewis and Dan Fogelman could adapt from, featuring cars of all makes and series being put together and competing with one another around the world. Or at least that's what the initial premise was thought to be, until someone decided to include a major plot to centre this around a James Bondish espionage tale about oil versus bio fuels, sidelining what would be simple to follow for the kids, and making this one vehicle based spoof of Bond, complete with gadgets, planes, trains and more automobiles.<br/><br/>But that's not to say I didn't like the idea, since it had a very interesting motivation and adversary built between the elites - those branded, luxury models and the lemons, mass produced vehicles who don't have prestige nor prominence, but go about their daily chores if not for faulty and cheap parts to break them down at times. This was an aspect that was present, but could have played up a lot more, especially since we are dealing with fat egos in Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), and that of his rival in this installment, the Formula One Italian car Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro) with an even larger ego that came complete with ill wisecracks.<br/><br/>And who knew the main character of the film swung from Lightning McQueen to his small town buddy the tow truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), who enrolled his race car friend into a competition organized by Sir Miles Axlerod (Eddie Izzard), a tycoon bent on proving bio fuels to be a safer alternative to oil. So a crew from McQueen's posse at Radiator Springs got put together, and off they go into three legs of a race around the world, in Japan, Italy and England. But it's spy versus spy stuff with Mater got tangled with British spies Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and his assistant Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) as they go about trying to uncover who the mastermind is behind the sabotage of the race, and perhaps these episodes were the most fun, having the bumbling Mater working together with the slick spies in many set action pieces. It's pretty adult with its espionage theme complete with torture and murder, so parents you've got some explanations to do.<br/><br/>With Pixar you can be quite assured of the quality of animation in this film, but somehow when compared to the other Pixar films of late, from Wall.E to Up to Toy Story 3 even, those films had a lot of heart and emotion put into their characters, whereas this one lacked that emotional punch, coming close to reiterating the importance of friendship again, but overall feeling too superficial, focusing a lot more on the technical aspects of an animated film, and the buffoonish Mater for comedic effect. It's akin to waxing the exterior of a vehicle to shiny perfection, but pop the hood, and the flaws show up with the lack of a proper, driving engine to fuel the story.<br/><br/>It's still not that bad when compared to other animated films in recent years, but given that Pixar had raised its own bar so high, Cars 2 fell a little short, though still no less entertaining as a film, just never being able to reach the company's stratospheric heights in terms of storytelling, and heart.<br/><br/>Those who missed our friends from Toy Story will do yourselves a favour by coming into the cinema earlier to catch the usual short preview before the main Pixar feature, where we see the toys rather settled in their new home and new owner, and turning their play environment into a Hawaiian paradise so that Ken and Barbie can share their first kiss. It's a short feature, but these precious minutes prove to be quite the powerhouse with drama, romance and comedy all rolled into one, and in itself worth the price of an admission ticket."
"FatMan-QaTFM","Null","1","1","24 August 2011"," Lovely graphics, overplayed characters, and a weak plot.
","If there's any company I would kill to work for more than Google, it'd be Pixar. I think John Lasseter is brilliant. He could easily be described as the Lucas of animation – vision, drive, extreme creativity and organization – but he's missed the mark on more that one occasion with A Bug's Life and the first Cars movie. Maybe he should be creatively steering the company, not directing – don't continue to be a Lucas.<br/><br/>Cars 2 centers on a sort spy story crossed with complete incompetence. Think Johnny English with a little Naked Gun thrown in, but less slapstick and more characters screaming ""WHOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAA"" every five minutes. The trailers promised cool race scenes set in exotic locations, much like Speed Racer, but never really delivered on any good car action (ha!). I try to view kids movies as a kid – enjoying the pretty colors, loud sounds, and over-the-top action. Cars 2 never grabbed my interest – too many cluttered sets, scattered plot, and too much Larry the Cable Guy.<br/><br/>I'm not opposed to big-name voice actors when they get in to a character (I almost forgot Jack Black was voicing Poalmost), but Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy are completely overbearing in any situation. They ruined what could have been a fun kid movie in Cars and crushed the life out of Cars 2. I suppose when the lynch-pin of your story relies on a character voiced by a Southern hick persona created by a Mid-Western comedian, you might take a big gamble. Unfortunately critics and moviegoers reinforced Pixar's decisions in a big way opening weekend and without a doubt an annoying Cars 3 will hit theaters in a few years.<br/><br/>I can't review a Pixar film without touching on the beautiful art of animation. Every shiny bit, piece of dust, fleck of water was art in motion. Pixar, hands down, is killing everybody when it comes to CG animation. I would love to see them take on visual effects for a live- action film. I think they could up the standard for the rest of the industry, not that it stops DreamWorks from cranking out their junk every 4 months. It's a shame they didn't have the typical strong story to compliment the talent in the animation department.<br/><br/>While the lovely graphics raised Cars 2 to watchable levels, overplayed characters and a weak plot don't do much for this movie. Even the short felt phoned in with recycled Toy Story characters and sets. At least I got to see the Brave trailer. Mmm."

The points where i feel this film fell short was that the story was pretty strange for a film that was originally meant to be about racing and the spy aspect did feel a little bit off. what I found very odd in a film that is a U was the level of death and i know that might be a strange thing to say since all the characters are all cars so what does it matter if they get blown to peaces but aren't people meant to be able to relate to these characters and if some of the things that happened in this film happened to real people then this film would at least be a twelve.

","Cars 2 is the sequel to Pixar's Academy Award nominated film, Cars. This film is centred around Mater, not McQueen but Mater who is a rusty tow truck with a lovable personality. The movie's basic plot is Mater being mistaken for a spy while accompanying McQueen throughout the World Grand Prix races. <br/><br/>First off, I think the movie lacked the ability for the audience to be emotionally attached to the characters, therefore there was not any great character development. Everything we knew and loved about the characters was not furthered but rather left at how it was in the first film. Luckily, they have built a strong foundation.<br/><br/>The film's plot was good but could have been better. Spy Cars could have been a good name for the movie. Its creative however a bit silly at times. It wasn't very predictable but the ending is something you would have thought of possibly happening, which ruins movies for me.<br/><br/>However the animation is amazing and it is a very enjoyable film for what it is - an animated spy movie involving cars.

Then a few years later we get The Lion King 2 and then The Lion King 1 1/2. These direct to DVD titles lacked the magic and wonder of the original film for obvious reasons; a lame retelling of the story, pushing minor characters into the spotlight, humor that just wasn't funny, and a smaller budget. Watching these DVD releases made me feel sorry for the people who worked on them.<br/><br/>Cars 2 should have been a direct to DVD release!<br/><br/>How Pixar ever let this one be released to theaters is beyond me? Cars is, by far, their most critically dismissed film. A lot of people, myself included, are not comfortable with the human-less world the Cars live in. The first one kept it simple, basing 95% of the film in a sleepy town off of the interstate, away from anything that would need to have human interaction, but this one has us globe trotting to various locations, speaking in several languages and watching cars perform a lot more human-like traits. How many American children will get the bidet joke? Or the ""pistachio ice cream"" bit? And what was up with the over the top violence? There were more than one torture scene in this film that were just down right nasty to have in a Pixar film. It was also a little creepy how they talk about Doc, but never try to tie up the lose end of where he is (RIP Paul Newman) during the film.<br/><br/>My verdict, this film has things that work: the animation is better looking than Toy Story 3, and the 3D actually works for the most part in this one.<br/><br/>What doesn't work is the corny one liners, the over the top violence and above all else, Mater! He was so annoying in this film! And if you enjoyed any of the other characters from Radiator Springs in the first film other than Mater, you may want to sit this one out. Even McQueen is a minor character in this film! This is strictly about Mater. Which gives the entire film a very direct to DVD feel as you watch it.<br/><br/>I overheard the two kids in front of me in the theater say to their father halfway into Cars 2; ""this is boring, why didn't we go see Transformers?""

","On the surface, it didn't seem like there was much cause for a direct sequel to this franchise, but given their track record I had to give Pixar the benefit of the doubt. In reality, it didn't take long for those early worries to be confirmed. This is like a jumbo-sized TV episode with incredible production values but a weak, redundant script. Where the original was, clearly, the worst of Pixar's properties, at least it had an honest message at heart; that the abundance of interstates and high speed traffic has ruined the necessity and charm of small-town America, at once mourning and celebrating that lost taste of cultural charm. By comparison, there's really no reason for Cars 2 to exist. It's a straight-up Saturday morning cartoon, shifting from caper to caper without the benefit of a discernible moral. And while there's really nothing wrong with that - there's an insatiable need for kid's fodder on the big screen, certainly - it's depressing to see it coming from the same company responsible for generation-transcending classics like Monsters Inc., Toy Story and Up. While it'll undoubtedly sell plenty of toys, this was the wrong movie at the wrong time for Pixar, and a rare instance of the studio losing ground to the competition."

","What the hell is this? I'm surprised Pixar had any hand in the creation of this film. It plays like one of Disney's direct-to-DVD features. A sequel in name only. Cars was a disappointment to me, but I understood it aimed at a younger audience. Cars 2 does this also, but also includes fairly violent scenes, unforgivable stereotypes, and not a single laugh. They choose one of the side characters to be the lead this time around for God knows what reason. They choose the most annoying character of all. An absolute moron of a creation. Worst of all, it gives a message to kids that it's OK to be an ignorant obnoxious fool in other countries, and that it's fine if you're stupid. Why is Mater played out as sympathetic? He literally ruins everything. On top of that we have a plot where the idiot is seen as the hero. This has been done hundreds of times before, but never this poorly. Cars wasn't even an action film to begin with. A change of genre, putting an annoying sidekick as the lead, more terrible puns, and you have Cars 2. The only highlights are the races and action scenes, but at 1 hour and 47 minutes, they really outstay their welcome."
"Rectangular_businessman","6","3","6","23 October 2011"," Not bad, but disappointing
","It seems that not even Pixar is infallible.<br/><br/>Despite all the criticism that it received, I liked the first ""Cars"" movie: It is true that it wasn't at the same level of masterpieces from Pixar such as ""Finding Nemo"" or ""The Incredibles"", but it was a nice film that was very enjoyable to watch, with many likable characters, disregard of the strange premise. But since the first film had a satisfying resolution, the idea of a sequel wasn't very interesting for meAnd too be honest, I don't think that this sequel was necessary at all. ""Cars 2"" isn't terrible as some critics said, it is just that it is doesn't feel like a Pixar movie. It feels more like a movie from Dreamworks, or from Blue Sky Studios. I guess that isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is still disappointing. <br/><br/>On the good side, the animation was pretty good (Even better than the first film) and most of the film was quite watchable, and some of the jokes were effective, despite the fact that most of them were forgettable. On the bad side, the plot from this film was way more childish than the one from the first film, and the most likable characters from the first movie have here a secondary role (Some even became extras, have a minimal role, having just a few lines) in order to give more importance to Mater and the new characters. Even Lightning McQueen, the protagonist of the first ""Cars"" became a secondary character in this sequel. <br/><br/>I don't hate ""Cars 2"", I just think it could have been way better (Or at least, more enjoyable for the adults, not only for the kids, as the first film was) Fortunately, the new project from Pixar, ""Brave"" seems incredible, and I can't wait for seeing it."

","I really like Pixar films, but I've always regarded ""Cars"" as the weakest Pixar offering - I would give that film 7/10.<br/><br/>Now this one - Cars 2; I verged on actively disliking this film. I particularly disliked the call - given by the Baddies; ""KILL LIGHTNING MCQUEEN"". I'm sorry - but this just isn't suitable for the very young following that a film like this is bound to attract.<br/><br/>Not only this; there is a lot of blasting and blaming, cars fall into the sea and are evidently drowned. There is quite a lot of low/medium level violence. I didn't like any of that and I think it's inappropriate. There are actively nasty dislikable characters.<br/><br/>The film itself is weak. It's sort of about misunderstandings and friendship, I think. But it comes out all twisted.<br/><br/>OK - It's fairly fast moving, it's very colourful. But on the other side - it's silly and actually a bit boring.<br/><br/>The first cars film was very mild and child-like, but Cars 2 goes in quite a different direction, a direction I didn't feel comfortable with. I'm surprised Pixar have come out with a follow-up like this, it's not like them.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this film."

","Last year, Pixar hit gold with Toy Story 3, which may be their crowning moment of glory. One particularly raved about scene (and understandably why) showed the toys being thrust face first into an inferno, trying their hardest to escape, but ultimately holding hands and coming to the realization that they are going to die. That scene became the most talked about scene in 2010's lists of summer blockbusters, on par with the brilliant fight scene in Inception where Arthur fights a man in a hotel hallway with shifting gravity. <br/><br/>Because of that, Pixar thought it would be cool to thrust High Octane Nightmare Fuel in their next (supposed) family oriented movie, including a rather gnarly fight between cars in a lube station, cars being destroyed with a laser type machine with the fuel in them, cars being tied up and begging for their lives, a pair of cars being tied to the gears of Big Ben and many others.<br/><br/>Aside from that general bit of unpleasantness in this bafflingly G rated movie, nothing happens.<br/><br/>No, seriously, nothing happens. Mater essentially drives around blabbering. On sense for essentially 75% of the movie. There is some bullcrap about Mater and an Italian race car and something about British intelligence. But the problem is, both of those sub stories go NOWHERE. <br/><br/>One should sincerely hope that Pixar was simply trolling us with even the idea of a Cars 2. Cars had a very mixed reaction from Pixar's overall fan base. It got the lowest rating prior to this movie on Rotten Tomatoes with 74%. And it's box office numbers were just barely average, even by Pixar standards. So with low expectations in place, one could expect a disappointment, and that said, that person is correct.<br/><br/>Just avoid this movie. Pixar, hang your heads in shame."

","A fun filled ride both kids and adults can enjoy. They certainly couldn't copy the first film with location and story, so they had to go all out with the story in a new direction to keep things fresh and interesting. Following the ever popular spy-thriller genre, for me, they succeeded - I love spy thrillers. What's next? Cars from Space? (haha - Carboys and Aliens).<br/><br/>I saw this film in 3D, and Pixar never ceases to amaze me. The locations are beautiful, the story is good, and the humour is still there. Pixar sticks adult jokes or references in there that most kids won't understand (like Mater in the washroom, or certain bond references), and locations I have been to recently (namely Paris) were a welcome sight for me to visit in the film.<br/><br/>The only thing I can say for sure is that I don't think it will leave an impact as the first film did for me: Cars 1 was really my first introduction to Pixar, when I fell in love with their work. That film blew me away, and I will never forget my experience watching it. The only thing new in this film for me was the scenery and the story. But that doesn't mean I enjoyed it any less."
"RichardSRussell-1","4","8","24","24 June 2011"," 11 Hits, and Finally a Miss
","Cars 2 (1:46, G, Imax, 3-D) — other: talking animals, biggie, sequel<br/><br/>I would like you to stop for a moment and reflect on the wonders Pixar has given us thru the years: A Bug's Life, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALLE, the beloved Toy Story trilogy, and of course Up, the 1st 7 minutes of which are worth the entirety of most animated features. Every one a winner. My least favorite of their offerings was Cars, and even there they proved that they could take the unlikeliest of protagonists (egotistical race car Lightning McQueen) and make it almost as endearing as an ant, a big furry blue closet monster, a gourmet rat, a voiceless mobile trash compactor, and a clownfish with a withered fin.<br/><br/>There's never been any question about the incredibly high technical quality of Pixar's animation, but more than that they never lost sight of the fact that the story came first, and that's what's made them the most revered name in animation.<br/><br/>So let's remember all the gratitude we owe them for 25 years of excellence as we stay away from the regrettable Cars sequel in droves.<br/><br/>This film is loaded with way too many vehicles going way too fast to keep track of, way too often. Not as loud as Transformers, not as disjointed as Speed Racer, these are nonetheless only faint mitigations for an over-emphasis on short-attention-span theater. Flash, dash, and smash is a video game, not a story line.<br/><br/>Not that there isn't plenty of off-racetrack plot. Way too much, in fact, far too complicated, and presented much too hastily and sketchily. It mainly involves James Bondian spy games concerning peak oil and corporate corruption. Believe me, I am totally the target audience for that kind of message, but even I found it uncomfortably preachy.<br/><br/>Top billing in the movie deservedly goes to Larry the Cable Guy, as rustbucket (but nonetheless Lightning's best friend) wrecking truck Tow Mater, a buffoonish hick who was used lightly as comic relief in the 1st film but is determinedly thrust into the forefront here by storytellers who figure they've always won in the past by betting on losers, outsiders, and the downtrodden. It's worked before, but not this time. Shtick like Mater's is a garnish, here served up as a main course, a banquet of parsley.<br/><br/>Try as they might, the animators just can't overcome the fact that cars don't really have either expressions or hands. Here the story (screenplay by Ben Queen from a story by Dan Fogelman and co-directors John Lasseter and Brad Lewis) requires extensive use of both, and it just comes off forced and fakey.<br/><br/>Y'know, if you were hitting .917 in the major leagues, you'd be the greatest player of all time by a gargantuan margin. Let's not forget that as we note sadly that even geniuses can't hit a home run every single at-bat."

I don't have a particular interest in cars, but the first Cars still had a heart, and a point to it...this felt like what I was expecting from Pixar after Disney bought them...and I hope it's not the start of a trend.<br/><br/>It's just a joke next to Monsters, Inc, or The Incredible, or Ratatouille (which I can't spell), or Wall*e, or even Toy Story 3 (which surprisingly not only justified its existence, but was the best in the series, I thought).<br/><br/>There's just nothing here...Paul Newman of course is gone.

Sure it may be deeply industrial but those cars looks like the ones we played with as kids. Next, the clear characterization of the friends, a dumb and an extrovert is helpful to build a plot, gags and a morality.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the production didn't manage to write a decent story around. As I watched the movie with my 6 years old nephews, i have got the feeling after the Japanese round to be in Transformers or Toy Story 3: guns, violence and the villain's scheme is totally beyond understanding.<br/><br/>A spy story is already difficult to follow but if in the same time, the bad guy wears a mask, the targeted audience is totally lost: ask my nephews about it and they can't tell what the movie is about. That's why it will disappear quickly from our memories. So producers: stop making brilliant stories and just make it simple!"
"FairlyAnonymous","3","2","4","19 June 2016"," The only Pixar film that is offensively bad
","Cars 2 isn't just a mediocre or bad film, it is also mildly offensive in how dumb it is.<br/><br/>I honestly have no idea how this movie was greenlit. Nothing in it works. The first movie was about Lightning McQueen and him getting over his ego and trying to help a town. It was a fairly slow movie that was character driven. Granted, not the best film, but it had its charm and it had heart. <br/><br/>The movie follows the adventures of Mater who ends up being accidentally mistaken for a secret agent. This forces who to go from country to country and uncover a big conspiracy, while Lightning McQueen is in an international racing competition. This means Mater is the main character and everyone else takes the backseat (even though the movie poster shows Lightning up front and Mater in the back).<br/><br/>This movie feels like a parody of Cars. It is an action, spy movie, with cars, and mildly attempts to be a racing movie at the same time. The big problem with this is that none of the action really works and Mater is too stupid to be likable (oh and btw, this movie is probably the most violent of the Pixar films as far as on-screen deaths go). The reason why the action doesn't work is because... it is cars. Try and make a box do kung-fu. Try and make a box do a backflip. See? It doesn't sound interesting. Because so much of this movie relies on chases and car action, it makes the movie terribly boring because none of it works. It's like ""Yeah, this would be a cool action sequence... if it weren't done with cars"".<br/><br/>Now, to make things worse, Mater is one of the most annoying on- screen protagonists I have seen in an animated movie. Heck, even Freddie the Frog was just dumb, but not inherently annoying. The problem with Mater is that he is the cause of most of almost all of the relationship struggles. While Mater is supposed to be dumb but likable, in this movie he is so stupid that it feels like he doesn't care for his friends. He is essentially living in his own world, and everyone is kind and compassionate enough to allow him to mess up everyone else's plans, but then once Lightning gives up on Mater... it seems logical. Yeah, Mater isn't taking Lightning's life seriously and Mater is actively messing it up even when Lightning tries to help him over and over again. <br/><br/>To make things even more offensive, the movie's end theme is ""Mater, everyone is wrong to get mad at you. You be you and everyone else should be okay with what you do. Everyone else needs to change."" And while that is a feel-good moral, it doesn't make sense. The fact that Mater is unintentionally being selfish and screwing things up means that HE needs to step up his act. If Mater wasn't so annoying in this movie I could understand, but he just does so much wrong. I feel like half this movie is scenes of him messing up. That is a problem with Mater, not a problem with the rest of the world.<br/><br/>But what about the rest of the characters? Almost non-existent. I think McQueen is only in this movie to get mad at Mater for always messing things up. What about the other characters? also non- existent. They show up every now and then.<br/><br/>Oh and Mater gets girlfriend at the end of this movie and it makes no sense. It is actually so dumb it hurts, because everyone acts like ""Yeah, they're perfect for each other"" when they clearly aren't. <br/><br/>If I really wanted to, I could go on about every scene and everything wrong with this movie, but the fact is that it is a bad film. The pacing is insanely fast, there is little to no character development, the action is boring, it isn't really funny, Mater is insanely annoying, there is no heart in this film, it has a bad moral, and none of the characters act like they did in the last film. This feels like a low-budget spin-off of the last movie, with an entirely different team of writers. It just feels so drastically different that I don't even consider them as part of the same series.<br/><br/>However, if you like watching bad movies, this is a good bad movie. It hurts to watch, but may be worth it."

Imagine the plot of every spy movie ever made, every bad pun and shameless advertisement gag, roll it all up into an impressively animated movie and suck out all the heart that is typically found in a Pixar movie, but a bright red ""cliche"" stamp on it, and you have Cars 2. It was by far the WORST Pixar movie, and it disgraced the first Cars movie, which had an incredible story along with impressive animation. Mater completely ruined the movie. He was annoying, utterly clueless, and oblivious to insult. Finn McMissle was the best character of the movie, despite his utter incompetence to figure out that Mater is not a spy. And Lightning McQueen was a minor character at best, and at the end he spat out the most stereotypical, unoriginal lines in Pixar history. This movie was filled with ""Ugh"", ""Of course"", and ""You've GOT to be kidding me"" moments. And on top of that, it was quite a violent movie, definitely not worthy of a G-rating. There were so many things wrong with it. <br/><br/>John Lasseter, you have lost your touch."

","There is a lot that could be said about this film, but the 1 thing that particularly bugged me is that the 'baddie' is German. Not just that he is German, but in the story plot about fuel that he is. I want to get this straight, I am English and have neutral feelings about Germans, I also watched this film with dutch dubbed voices. It just really grated on me that the hero is American and the baddie German - as it almost always is in an American production.<br/><br/>As you know, the story is about Germans trying to slander the bio fuel company in order to get everyone to buy petrol (gas). - In short.<br/><br/>In reality, Germans are friendly, welcoming, polite and compared to the Americans, very eco friendly. When it comes to politics, the Germans never made up a war in order to drain a country of petrol for profit and before people start to drag up the world wars - please do your research on it and you will find the German people suffered as much as any. German doesn't equal Nazi.<br/><br/>But once again, stereotypical views from uneducated people has to another film produced where the Germans are bad and American the perfect hero ( example - die hard ).<br/><br/>This is a really false and bad view of Germans to be showing to children and for this reason, I really hated this film and had I known it previous, I wouldn't have gone along to support it nor take a child with me.<br/><br/>In terms of graphics it as pretty as ever, but in 2011 that doesn't impress so much any more.

"zardoz-13","Null","2","4","11 July 2011"," A Sequel That Surpasses The Original!!!
","You know the topic of alternative fuel sources has attained a new urgency when an animated movie appropriates it as its theme. The new Pixar/Disney racecar sequel ""Cars 2"" deals with the issue of our scarce oil reserves and the need to conjure up a substitute. ""Cars"" director John Lasseter and ""Proximity"" scenarist Ben Queen have skillfully inserted this message into ""Cars 2"" without slighting the shenanigans which made the original comedy such fun. In fact, ""Cars 2"" qualifies as the rare sequel that surpasses its predecessor. The chief reason this hilarious sequel tops ""Cars"" is that Lasseter and crew have promoted Lightning McQueen's sidekick Tow Mater to the pole position. Larry the Cable Guy's cinematic career appeared in the pits before he provided the voice for Tow Mater. His redneck accent and cornpone humor made him ideal for a rusted wrecker with no hood and buck teeth sticking out of its grille. Sidekicks have always been scene-stealers, and Tow Mater is virtually the whole show in ""Cars 2."" Mind you, British actor Michael Caine gives Larry the Cable Guy a run for his money, relegating goodie-four tires Lightning McQueen to third place. McQueen still claims his share of screen time. Indeed, he provides the motivation for the plot. Nevertheless, Tow Mater and a gray Aston Martin, voiced by Michael Caine, named Finn McMissile emerge as the leading cars. Unlike the racecars only plot for the original, ""Cars 2"" shifts its gears and combines the usual racing antics with a sophisticated plot about a devious effort to discredit alternative fuel sources. <br/><br/>Again, when a kids' movie shines the limelight on the issue as imaginatively as Pixar and Disney have done, you have to wonder who has gone to sleep at the steering wheel. In a sense, ""Car 2"" amounts to a clever propaganda movie that advocates the manufacture of alternative fuel sources. Just as ""Cars"" celebrated the happy days before an interstate highway bypassed a town and demoted it to obscurity; ""Cars 2"" recalls 1960s' nostalgia when James Bond made the silver screen sizzle. <br/><br/>Basically, ""Cars 2"" sends red racing car Lightning McQueen and his best friend Tow Mater off onto the international racing circuit after a conceited Italian hot rodder, Francesco (voice of John Turturro), challenges our hero to prove who has the fastest wheels in the world. No sooner has McQueen gotten back to Radiator Springs after clinching his fourth Piston Cup championship than he wants to pick up where he left off with his girlfriend Sally (voice of Bonnie Hunt) who is the powder-blue Porsche. Initially, McQueen and Tow Mater have a blast speeding around town and indulging in some really big tractor tipping. Afterward, McQueen plans to date Sally and explains to Tow Mater that they want to be alone together. Not one to be put off, Tow Mater crashes their dinner date by posing as a waiter. Lightning and Sally order their 'usual' drinks. Tow Mater careens off to the bar to fetch them without knowing what they drink. While Tow Mater wonders what those 'usual' drinks are, he hears a Formula-One racecar named Francesco insult McQueen on the Mel Dorado television show. In no time, a crowd of cars assembled around Tow Mater who has called into the show to tell off Francesco. McQueen and Sally notice the crowd. Eventually, McQueen intervenes after Francesco insults Tow Mater. The sponsor of the World Grand Prix, Sir Miles Axlerod (voice of Eddie Izzard), is a wealthy Land Rover who is overjoyed when McQueen decides to enter his race. As car characters go, Sir Miles is an interesting vehicle. It seems he decided to circle the globe without a GPS and wound up lost in the wilderness where he exhausted his gasoline supply. Everybody had given up Sir Miles as lost when he emerged from the jungle running on a fuel source that he markets now as Allinol. The World Grand Prix represents Sir Miles' attempt to corner alternative fuel source market. Sir Miles plans to stage three races in Japan, Italy, and England to tout Allinol as a substitute for gasoline. Furthermore, he is making Allinol available to all racers. Nevertheless, there is more to Sir Miles than meets the eye, and Finn McMissile suspects the racing magnate has other things under his hood. ""Cars 2"" opens with Finn riding out to a remote part of the ocean in the middle of the night for a rendezvous with another car. When the trawler transporting Finn encounters a bigger trawler that threatens to blow it out of the water, the smaller trawler flees. Meanwhile, Finn manages to latch onto the bigger trawler and ride it back to a stretch of ocean dotted by a multitude of oil rigs atop a new underwater range of oil reserves.<br/><br/>If you think Sir Miles is a character, Finn McMissile is an Aston Martin with a gadget for every contingency. He can scale walls using grappling hooks launched from his bumpers. He has special magnetic tire covers that enable him to drive up the legs of mammoth oil rigs. Of course, he boasts other more traditional gadgets that allow him to perform equally incredible feats. Somehow, an American spycar posing as a Gremlin to infiltrate the villain's ranks acquires all the information that Finn needs to expose the mystery surrounding a worldwide scam. Before the American agent car is destroyed by the villains, he slips the information to an unsuspecting Tow Mater. Finn mistakes Tow Mater as a world-class espionage agent masquerading as a buffoon. You can just imagine all the hilarity that ensues when a fleet of Gremlins, Pacers, and Yugos pursue Tow Mater to relieve him of the information which will not only expose their perfidy but also the car behind it. Lasseter orchestrates one amusing stunt after another in this lively 106-minute spoof of spy movies with more sight gags than you will ever spot on the first viewing."

","his is a sequel to the first film from the masterminds at my favorite animation studio, Pixar. The film has recently been receiving a huge wave of negative criticism, and it's the first Pixar film that has ever received a rotten rating on Rotten Tomatoes.<br/><br/>It takes off five years after the events of the first film, with Lightning McQueen (Voiced by Owen Wilson) now a winner of four Piston Cups. So, he is invited to the first annual World Grand Prix to determine the world's fastest car, and to advertise a new brand of alternative fuel. He invites his friend Mater along, and while Lightning is racing in the tournament, Mater (Voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) gets swept up in a case of international espionage. He's mistaken for an American spy by a sleek, British Intelligence agent named Finn McMissile (Voiced by Michael Caine), and an agent in training named Holley Shiftwell (Voiced by Emily Mortimer), two cars seeking to bring down a plot to take over the world by a league of old fashioned, more broken down cars.<br/><br/>The recent reception mentioned earlier had made me a bit gloomy, as I'd hoped I'd never have to see Pixar make a bad movie. And you know what? While it's worth noting that it's their worst film, and isn't among the ranks of WALL·E, Ratatouille, or Finding Nemo, I was incredibly relieved that, personally, I still haven't had to see Pixar make a bad movie. I think it's just as enjoyable as any of their other movies.<br/><br/>This is Pixar's second stab at a full on, fast paced action film (The first of which was The Incredibles), and the movie is highly gleeful in its 1960's spy movie tone and stylistics. The plot is like an animated twist on a James Bond film, right down to the cool cars and gadgets, international jumping between scenic locations, even the film's villain, Professor Zundapp, delightfully based on the foreign, scientific masterminds of the James Bond series. That, and Finn McMissilie is clearly an homage to Bond, himself.<br/><br/>I do think it slightly lacked the same stellar character development we usually expect from Pixar, and sometimes it feels a little too crowded, but I think Cars 2 has a lot of charming factors that propel it. The action is really exciting, the movie moves briskly, and it's filled with so many hilarious gags. I especially admire the voice-over performances, which also includes the likes of John Turturro, Thomas Kretshmann, Eddie Izzard and Joe Mantegna.<br/><br/>The technical side of the film is also utterly amazing. I need not bring up the animation, as anyone who's ever seen one of Pixar's movies would expect it to be of the highest quality, which it is. The sound design by Tom Myers will surely go down as one of the year's best, and I would be a fool not to mention composer Michael Giacchino's thrilling mixture of John Barry and surf guitar. And while 3D is a polarizing factor for movies, I think it really added to the excitement of this one.<br/><br/>And now, while I go anxiously await Pixar's next feature film, Brave, I'll most likely be back to the cinema once, or even twice more to give Cars 2 some richly deserved business.<br/><br/>I give it *** out of ****"

","As time has passed, Pixar has proved us to go one step ahead from other animated production companies, by being our number one choice on the category of ""Best Animated Film"" at the Oscars, by always giving us more than the expected, (Just like they did with ""Wall-e"" and ""Up!"") or by managing into getting animated movies to get an Oscar nomination for ""Best Picture"". They never settled with an OK-job, they always aimed for excellence. However in Cars 2 they didn't prove it so. I can't complain about the excellent visual effects and the majestic settings, but the script just didn't prove to be Pixar material. It was a risky move taking a supporting character and giving it a leading role, which didn't work as well as I expected. I'm not saying the movie sucked, I just think they could have done a better job, and it was Pixar's worst movie yet. (Not bad, but still the worst).<br/><br/>I think, among their other fascinating animated pictures, they could have made a sequel that created more expectation on the audience like ""Monsters, Inc."" or ""The Incredibles"".<br/><br/>I also understand they abandoned a project named ""Newt"" because of budget trouble, to focus in producing the sequels ""Toy Story 3"" and ""Cars 2"". In the case of ""Toy Story 3"" I completely understand, but in the case ""Cars 2"" I think it was a stupid decision. However I won't lower my Pixar expectations. I expect them to give us what we want in their next film, ""Brave"", and to continue making excellent jobs in the future.

It was a highly anticipated film, but it clearly fell flat, and missed the mark completely. John Lasseter gave us a messy, unwanted, unoriginal spy sequel. First things first, they should've scrapped EVERYTHING about the spy scheme, and expanded on building Radiators Springs. I was personally excited to see them expand on Radiator Springs, but they decided to go cliché once again, and do a stupid world tour. With the reputation that Pixar has of building worlds, this one was just okay, but could've been so much better, and focused. This may be far fetched, but I got this weird taste of Rocky 3 & 4 in this movie.<br/><br/>Owen Wilson returns as Lightning McQueen, but as an underlining character; he just didn't have much to do. McQueen seemed to have matured off screen, but in the first set, it seemed like the same arrogant McQueen, mixed with the nice guy attitude as well. After the heavy foreshadowing first act, the movie basically became super predictable and all about Mater. Larry the Cable Guy hasn't lost a step, as far as his comedy and stature goes. If you like his character, you'll most likely enjoy this film. If you are one of those people who had a negative opinion on Mater, you're most likely going to strongly dislike this movie. As much as I love Michael Caine, Finn McMissile, and everyone else affiliated with the spy scheme, should've been abolished. I didn't care for any of their characters whatsoever. Professor Z is just a cliché bond villain, that the writers try making important, but he just sucked.<br/><br/>The screenplay by John Lasseter, Dan Fogelman & Ben Queen had their fair share of comedy, but it wasn't as cohesive as the first, and seemed a little forced at time, including the world cultural jokes.<br/><br/>We got more action this time around, but that doesn't necessarily mean it was better. The racing, courses, and foreign car designs were very cool, but all of that kind of took a back seat to the stupid spy theme they were going for. The cinematography by Jeremy Lasky, again & Sharon Calahan was visually beautiful, with so many colors, with amazing animations, that stood out more than the first movie. The art directors created this beautiful European atmosphere, with realistic looking back drops, that I personally don't really care for in an animated film.<br/><br/>Overall, I hate to say this because I really enjoyed the original Cars but, Cars 2 my least favorite Pixar movie."

","Espionage, assassinations, sabotage of renewable energy, propaganda, corporate cover-ups, media manipulation and The Mob...<br/><br/>James Bond? Nope. Jason Bourne? Nope.<br/><br/>Disney/Pixar's CARS 2. Wow. This movie wasn't at all what I was expecting. In the second serving of Lightning McQueen and his pals, they take their show to the international stage in a world championship race-off sponsored by oil-alternative manufacturer, Allinol. But turmoil behind the scenes pulls the gang into a world of spies, the Mob, Big Oil, evil German scientists and hit men. Now they have to save the world before it's too late. Oh, and they race too. The animation is amazing. Water, large balloons, backgrounds during races...pay attention because the quality of the graphics in this one are world-class. There are some goofy, funny moments and some nice one- liners for the older crowd. The themes of being true to yourself and bonds of friendship run strong throughout this film but it's the remainder of the message that worried me. There were non-stop put downs throughout and some other questionable topics. I was beginning to question the G rating when the villain ordered his henchmen to ""kill"" several other cars. Thinking back to the innocence and the good spirit of the first movie, I began to wonder how we got from there to here. Adventures in racing take a back-seat to the more mature plot of an espionage thriller. Looking around the theater, I could tell that kids younger than 4 or 5 were beginning to get lost. Even my ten-year-old had a hard time understanding the socio-political messages. On top of all that, I'd be willing to bet that Cars 2 is a contender for most guns, explosions and bullets fired in a G-Rated movie. This movie had much more violence than the first one.<br/><br/>Aside from the appropriateness of the movie, it wasn't bad. All the likable characters from the first movie were back with bigger roles like 'Mater & Luigi and there were many new characters added that also brought their own personalities into the mix. To me, this was an espionage-thriller so the added bonus of some comedy made the movie move right along at a good pace.<br/><br/>It was engaging for me, I enjoyed it, but the entire time I couldn't help but wonder why Disney/Pixar chose to tell this story through a kids movie."

","The Disney/Pixar library has grown extensively since the debut of 'Toy Story' back in 1995. In 2011, we saw a follow up to one of the studios' least popular entries - 'Cars.' The sequel that no one asked for was, as expected, not good.<br/><br/>The problem with 'Cars 2' is similar to the problem with the original - talking cars are just not as compelling as fish, toys or even monsters. It's like, ""so what, who cares?"" Even with the voice talents of Owen Wilson, Michael Caine and Bonnie Hunt, it's not enough to make up for the overdone plot and the constant grating of Larry the Cable Guy's voice (why was Mater in almost every scene in this movie?).<br/><br/>Sure, there's a nice message in here about being yourself, etc., but the wrapper that this principle is stuffed in is just not appealing whatsoever.<br/><br/>'Cars 2' is perhaps one of the biggest clunkers from these animation studios' catalogue, which makes the fact that it yielded a three-quel very perplexing."
"lexiconby","10","0","0","21 April 2020"," Actually a really clever film!
","My actual rating is 7.8 but given how low the overall score, I need to give it a 10 to try and bring up the average.<br/><br/>Where is the ""lesson"" in this movie? Mater who everything thinks is an idiot and a fool, proves that even with all of his seemingly lack of social awareness redeems himself at the end.<br/><br/>There is also a message about being embarrassed by your friend who might be socially awkward, wanting to change him/her rather than loving them for who they are. Being accepting of others, no fight is worth losing a friendship, having the courage to take a stand even when others doubt you and accepting your imperfections (especially the ones from your friend) like the dings on the cars.<br/><br/>So to me, there is plenty of morals to be learned and they did it with great intricate detail to the homage of cars. The creators really went to great lengths to make sure the content was true to facts. If you know automobiles, then you are smiling when they make car references including cars which were considered lemons. Yes, the Range Rover was a lemon, just like the Hugos, Gremlins, Pacers and many others. I also loved the play on words and names they come up with. It's cute, funny and ingenious! The double entendre are just hilarious.<br/><br/>Is it suitable for children? My opinion is we don't give children enough credit. Why don't we let them decide and they might surprise us by actually understanding a movie with adult themes.<br/><br/>This movie is pretty funny and if you're a car lover like me, you will enjoy it just like the first one."

You know, Lightning McQueen's rusty tow truck sidekick from that little town in the first movie. Yeah, he's the main character in this. He teams up with a pair of British spy cars who are tracking an international terrorist group looking to discredit a new bio-fuel initiative.<br/><br/>Yes, really.<br/><br/>And I have to admit, I was not expecting that. None of us were. And in its bat guano insanity, I managed to find something. Is it a good film? Not really. There world still makes no sense, the Lightning McQueen side plot is perhaps needed, but ends up feeling rather pointless, and the humour is still only so-and-so. But I have to admit that when you have British James Bond cars zooming across the skies with jet engines and pulling mounted miniguns out of their fenders, you suddenly become much more accepting of the little oddities this world has. Like the fact that these cars need fuel to function, but they still eat human food. For some reason. Isn't fuel their food?<br/><br/>And that's really the movie in a nutshell. It's Pixar's nice little break from the heavier stuff. It doesn't mean much, but you can have fun with it, and it's very much the definition of harmless.

Mater has to find out who's been killing off the racers using a beam that ignited the gas they're using.<br/><br/>The animation's great as always but the story feels out of place. I like Mater but I think he worked better in small doses. Making him the main character instead of McQueen seems weird. If anything McQueen himself is pretty much sidelined.

","Cars 2 picks up several years after the first with Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) ruling the Piston Cup. This leads him to be invited to the first World Grand Prix where he can pit himself against the best of the rest and in particular Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro) the cocky Italian stallion F1 car. McQueen's crew led by Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) gather together and set out on the trip of a lifetime to Japan, Italy and England to fight for the right to be named the best in the world. While McQueen is off racing, Mater finds himself caught up in the secret world of government spies and espionage.<br/><br/>First off the graphics and world in which Pixar create is stunning with no little detail overlooked. Bringing some of the scenes into real world venues also helped to show off the talent of the people at Pixar. It was also interesting to see how cars go about your average human tasks such as flying on a plane and even going to the toilet with the phenomenal background detail dragging you into the film- plane pigeons were one of many nice touches. It sounds strange to say but at some points you almost forget you are watching cars.<br/><br/>The comedy level was good throughout and with a good (although somewhat predictable and disjointed) plot that hugged the Bond style template closely this has many things going for it. I don't think it's an out and out kids movie and would probably stick it in the young adult section but as with most Pixar, it transcends all the age boundaries.<br/><br/>The real problem I found with the film is that although the environment is great, it's quite hard for the graphics team to be overly expressive with the cars themselves which lead me to not connect with the characters as much as I would have liked. If you don't feel for the characters then the rest of the film starts to fall away beneath you. Also the plot is split into two separate stories so that at some points it feels like you are watching two movies rather than one.<br/><br/>Mater, while he worked well as a bit character in the original seems to be the main character for this which is a role less suited to him. He is a simple minded car who gets most of his laughs through slapstick which works well in small doses but not so much for the entire film. The lack of progression in character development from the first to this one also lets the film down with the lessons merely being relearned by the same characters again.<br/><br/>Out of all of Pixar's creations, I have always felt that the Cars franchise was the weakest of the group and Cars 2 has failed change my opinion. Yes the graphics are some of the best yet and the world is very immersive but as characters go something was lacking and the whole idea of the film didn't gel. Considering this is their 25th anniversary, I would have expected the cream of the crop but instead was only treated to a just above average performance.

","Cars 2 has the pacing of a long Chevron commercial with nice visuals. Pixar's track record has been close to untouchable when crafting their films. Their movie are geared toward children with the thought process of parents interest in mind. They create intelligent, emotionally driven, beautifully detailed animated films, with plenty of humor and heart to appeal to movie for parents and children both to enjoy. With this in mind the creators of films behind the Pixar brand forgot about these elements when making a sequel to the off center original. The makers of the first Cars shied away from those various things to a certain degree and just intended the film to be loved by kids. Cars one was not a bad film at all just not as good or on the same level as its counterparts.The first Cars turn out nice box office numbers despite the some bad reviews by Pixar fans and what they were looking for, but hit home to the children expectation and imagination. In knowing that, this movie take that leap again that the first movie makes and tries to leap again and falls short of the capable entertainment. Cars 2 does not feel like a Pixar film at all, but resembles something that Dream works ( not hating on those movies) would have put out. It does not connect with me emotionally as a fan of Pixars various other films. Kids will enjoy every minute of this, witnessing all the new automobiles that the movie presents on the course of it's running time, but for older generation this movie may be a hit and miss. I for one did not care for the route that this film took and making a sequel. In viewing the first movie at the end of it I felt that it was a complete movie not needing a forced sequel like it received.The movie sequel feels like a straight to DVD quality film or a cartoon movie that would be screened on Disney channel or children networks. They also didn't explored the characters that were loved in the first movie. Every scene the audience was introduced to a new character which became the down fall of this film. They displayed some nice roles, but overcrowded the story of the two main characters that we wanted to know more about. Besides the action and some nicely displayed cars that made it to the film this movie just loses it's flame that it had in the first. The director placed the whole spy flick theme into the film to serve as a distraction for kids so they can introduce new cars. The plot didn't fit right with the whole world of Cars 1. One thing that Disney has done in this film that made it a passable movie is add this element to introduce the action that the first movie didn't have. They knew that another Cars original story line would not work a second time so they went this route to create another film for kids. The idea that Pixar has done was smart and inventive to capitalize on merchandize, but it was a fail attempt.This movie also lacks in comedy and heart that was also present in the first movie, but improve on the visual which are beautiful. Mator became annoying at times and served no purpose while he was on screen and I just never connected to the film as a older audience member. That is how this movie lacks the Pixar brand name influence because it falls short in those categories. Compared to the numerous dazzling hits that Pixar Studio has released in the past years, this film is a great disappointment to their track record, but can still achieve box office glory with the amount of fans of the first that this franchise has. With the growing number of animation films that have been put out in the last 10 years that are not under the umbrella of Pixar Studio's, this film still couldn't make the list of the top animation movies to date."

","In the family we're all big Pixar fans. We loved all their movies, know all their shorts, even use lines from Finding Nemo. My son was a big Cars fan.<br/><br/>We sat through Cars 2 but none of the Pixar feel was there. The visuals are spectacular and detailed, but the spy story itself is too convoluted and ultimately uninteresting and the humor is crude. I think we laughed twice during the whole movie. By the end my son was ""yeah, whatever"". Later that day we watched Rio and we enjoyed it much more.<br/><br/>Cars 2 is not only inferior to other Pixar movies, it's inferior to other new animated features. Cars was never the strongest Pixar piece but it had enough sweet childish fun to be enjoyable. Cars 2 looks like a different company with no clue tried to copy the concept."
"Queer-qatfm","4","3","8","23 August 2011"," Something went wrong at Pixar
","It's a challenge to critique movies for which you are squarely not within the intended audience. It's part of the reason why I skipped Judy Moody and the NOT Bummer Summer. While I'm sure we would have done well to get in touch with our inner Heather Graham, we just didn't think it fair to toss a pair of bad grades at a movie aimed at little girls. We'd much prefer tugging on their pig-tails and saying they have cooties. That being said, Pixar has always presented itself as not only the superior animated movie product to beat, it typically produces films that are creatively accessible on multiple levels. In fact within Wall-E and Up there are segments of pretty high end pieces of cinema. So for that reason, we're reviewing Cars 2.<br/><br/>Except it appears that this time something went wrong.<br/><br/>Perhaps the creators were on a Hawaiian vacation much like Ken and Barbie enjoy during the throw-away Toy Story short that appears before the feature presentation. Yes, I know, I know. We should be so lucky to even get cartoons before our movies. But I remember when these things were completely original shorts that were almost as buzz worthy as the reason why we were in the theatre to begin with. Disappointment sets in early, though Woody and Buzz do try their best to remain relevant past the completion of their trilogy last summer.<br/><br/>When it comes to Cars 2, we're treated to what is essentially a James Bond film featuring Larry the Cable Guy's character Mater. Quickly I'm reminded of Arthur and how Russell Brand was in nearly every single scene. Except instead of a man-child out of control Brit, we instead get an even more grating redneck caricature that's more hijinks than ha-has. Mater has been misconstrued as a spy, and there's a whole caper involving alternative fuels. Yes, Pixar is all about the green technology, so you gotta have a bit of environmentalism with your fun as usual.<br/><br/>The only problem is there isn't much fun to be had. At least not for an adult. The kids will likely enjoy some of the antics, as Mater screws up things but by doing so manages to solve problems along the way. Lightning McQueen is hardly featured. And everyone should really pay attention to just how marvelously beautiful the scenery is in the three international cities the World Grand Prix takes place in. (An effort included to no doubt boost international box office.) But really the spy story is just kind of lame. Not to mention rather violent for a rated G movie. I mean, cars with guns, rocket launchers, and tasers? So, in conclusion, you probably can skip this movie unless you have little ones. Yes, the visuals are stunning and enhanced to some degree with 3D technology. And there is just a sliver of heart to be found in the midst of all the madcap espionage. But generally speaking, it's all about the annoyance of Mater and marketing so that following the film's conclusion you can buy lots of stuff featuring the Cars brand. After all, when I bought my ticket I was given a small pamphlet that let me know Target has 'everything Cars'."

"gregeichelberger","5","4","13","24 June 2011"," Disjointed 'Cars 2' runs out of gas
","Lightening McQueen: ""Mater, you ARE the bomb."" <br/><br/>Never have truer words been spoken in a movie, and never have I had the displeasure to pronounce a Pixar film a failure - until now. ""Cars 2,"" the sequel to the 2005 runaway animated hit, misfires on so many cylinders, it becomes a huge lemon long before it crosses the finish line.<br/><br/>A convoluted plot involving secret agents, multiple races (mixing NASCAR, dirt track and Formula One autos) and a vendetta against oil and the combustible engine combine to slow this clunker down, all the while veering all over the track with almost disjointed and disconnected vignettes. Centering the storyline on Tow Mater (voice of Larry the Cable Guy) was a mistake, as well.<br/><br/>Plus, all of the charm of the first picture, with fish-out-of-water hotshot racer Lightening McQueen (Owen Wilson) trapped in the ghost town of Radiator Springs and learning about himself and others, is thrown out here. Instead, Lightening and the other townsfolk are pushed out of the spotlight, leaving the lightweight Mater to be involved with two British intelligence agents Fins and Holley (Michael Caine and Emily Mortimer) and a camera device that blows up car engines, or something to that effect.<br/><br/>Oh, and there's a subplot about alternative fuel that gives the movie a decidedly unwelcome politically-correct slant that runs the heavy-handed eco message into the ground. We're also treated to a host of characters, many of which are not even cars, at all. It becomes quite overwhelming and disconcerting in the end.<br/><br/>After Lightening is goaded into participating in the Global Grand Prix (with events in Tokoyo, Monte Carlo and London), he drags Mater along (for no good reason). This is proved when Formula One racer Franciso (John Tuturro) edges him out because of the tow truck's blunders. Booted off Team McQueen, Mater becomes involved in the ridiculous espionage premise that had children (as well as many adults) dozing off during the middle parts of the movie.<br/><br/>Without his idiot friend, McQueen acquits himself with a victory in Monte Carlo, so it all comes down to the final match-up in London. Unfortunately, as Fins, Holley and Mater try to figure out who's behind whatever is going on, the final race scenes are muffled and colorless.<br/><br/>The excitement of Tokoyo and the wonderful animation of Italy are substituted by the cloudy, overcast skies of Great Britain. It's almost a crime to diffuse the wild pastels and palettes of the first film (and the first half of this one) with such drabness.<br/><br/>The sequences in Japan are wonderfully funny and vibrant. The whole anime and overtly cute culture is parodied nicely. The scenes where Mater discovers sushi and bidets are especially delicious. That soon fades, though, and we're treated to a Bond film (more like a Gold Bond film) in which Michael Caine does a dust-off of his spy bit in ""Austin Powers: Goldmember."" <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the absence of color does not compare with the absence of heart, coherence and plausible story-telling that the original ""Cars"" offered. Directed by Academy Award winners John Lasseter and Brad Lewis, this is the first Pixar movie that I am forced to give a negative recommendation to, which is especially painful after such wonderful presentations as ""Monsters, Inc.,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" ""Ratatouille,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" ""Wall*E,"" ""Up"" and the ""Toy Story"" series."

"Otoboke","Null","2","5","25 July 2011"," For the kids.
","At this time in their illustrious careers as animators and storytellers, Pixar Studios are by no means strangers to the connotations of success. In fact, pretty much singlehandedly shifting the mainstream public's attention from hand-drawn animation to digital 3D during the late 90's, the studio is responsible not just for a whole mainstream movement in film, but also for providing audiences with the pinnacle of those very movies every summer. Eventually however, even the mighty must fall, and despite the initial disappointment of 2006's predecessor, the studio have went ahead and made this year's focus that of the same crazy, zany world of Cars—something unexpected, sure, but not entirely unquestioned.<br/><br/>Upon viewing Cars 2 however, you see clearly why. While far off from being something of a disaster, this project from director John Lassater (the man behind the first movie, and also some of the studio's better works) is nevertheless a true successor to the original in that it too fails to meet the high expectations usually derived from the Pixar name, and plods along seemingly out primarily to please itself. Much like Cars, but to a larger extent here, Cars 2 comes across as being overly indulgent in all the wrong areas—it's a movie which can be funny, but only sporadically and seemingly by happenstance; it's s a plaything of Lasster's that never truly reaches beyond the screen and grabs you; but worst of all is that it's routinely dumb—something that Pixar with intelligent movies such as WALL-E and the touching tales of Finding Nemo and UP! tend to stray away from.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Cars 2 feels more like an upper-tier episode of, say, Handy Manny mixed with iCarly. There are fart jokes and oil jokes, and an abundance of contrived character conflicts and Learning From Your Vanity moral taglines—it's the kind of thing that will please the younger audience, but hey, who the hell is going to deny enjoying Toy Story or The Incredibles, even at the ripe old age of 80? And I guess, that's where the problem lies; there's a split here that is very rarely present in the studio's work—something that lesser companies fall prey to every year for the sake that being cookie-cutter straight and safe is far easier to back as less of a risk than say, the first half-hour of WALL-E which has no dialogue. So in saying that, if by some leap of logic, you're reading this and happen to still be able to count your years with your 10 stubby digits, by all means stop; you'll enjoy this regardless.<br/><br/>For everyone else however, Cars 2 will no doubt disappoint. Partly because of its unapologetic focus on a central character who is thick as pudding (which would be fine, if it didn't infect the rest of the mind- numbingly simplistic plot and character development), but mostly because the writing itself is entirely unengaging and disconnected from any semblance of emotion or intelligence. Taking at least half the movie's meagre runtime to finally provide some back-story to the antagonist plot against our returning heroes Lightning McQueen and Mater, the movie simply feels uninvolving, boring and even just unfunny. To it's credit, the voice acting is top quality as per, as are the visuals, but such consolations just don't cut it when this kind of lazy writing drives the cogs underneath. Kids will still love it, sure, but don't expect to find yourself buying the DVD for yourself under the guise of ""it's for the kids."" This time, despite that Pixar name on the cover, it will be for the kids."
"jtatz","5","2","5","26 June 2011"," OK............. But disappointing
","Having been a long time Pixar fan, I can say that this is a big departure from other ""classics"". There is some charm, but for the most part the movie is much more violent and complicated than any other Pixar film I can think of. My father in law struggled to follow the story - and it's convoluted enough it's hard to articulately explain. Whereas Cars had a classy charm to it and a memorable soundtrack, this lacked a likable story and any music that was the least bit interesting. I can't believe that Cars 2 actually came out of the same studio. It's not terrible, but you shouldn't see this movie expecting any of the ""magic"" and innovation that Cars had. This movie is all explosions and drama."
"rgkarim","8","2","5","26 June 2011"," The Name is Mater, Tow Mater
","So yesterday I decided to hit the latest addition to the Pixar Family Cars 2, and see if Pixar could still make a good sequel. I'm happy to say that Pixar has once again crafted a fun, adventurous, and entertaining film that will please a lot of fans of the studio's work. However, I must admit that I was surprised by this movie is the amount of maturity in this film and the fact that it is only rated G, but we'll talk about that later.<br/><br/>Cars 2 starts out with a fast and flashy sequence of spy car fun as we watch the skilled spy car Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) infiltrate and oil rig fortress. After some exciting chase scenes, clever use of gadgets, and a catchy spy action tune, McMissile escapes and wonders who in the world can help save the world. <br/><br/>Cue Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), as we see the happy go lucky tow truck ride down the road and helping people in that innocent manner that made him famous. As he helps tow a poor broken down car, Mater gives us the back story of what Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has been up to in the past, which mainly involves racing and winning the Piston Cup, now named after the Hudson Hornet from the previous film. By chance McQueen just happens to be in town allowing the tow truck and race car to meet back up, in a brotherly fashion, and embark on their classic adventures we saw in the previous movie. After a few minutes of nostalgia, a couple of glimpses of an upgraded Radiator Springs, and that rekindled relationship between Sally (Bonnie Hunt) and McQueen, Radiator Springs is ditched as McQueen, thanks to the assistance of Mater, accepts the challenge of the international race competition. <br/><br/>It doesn't take long for McQueen and Mater to begin their international adventure, starting in Towkyo, Japan. Once they arrive in Japan, Pixar's classic moral story begins to come to fruition as we see a classic friendship face the tests of the judgement of society. While McQueen kind of reverts back into the selfish car obsessed with image and reputation from the first film, Mater still provides us with a bounty of laughs as his stupidity and clumsiness is introduced to the world. Here is where I wish to tell you that Mater is the focus of this movie and fans of Mater will not be disappointed by rust covered country bumpkin car. Whether it is mistaking wasabi for pistachio ice cream, spilling stuff on the floor, or awkwardly participating in conversations he is confused in Mater is still as lovable as the first film. <br/><br/>The twist to this film though is more about the spy business integrated into this story and Mater's role in the organization. I was impressed by how Pixar recruited Mater into the organization and how they kept his true identity a secret from McMissile throughout most of the movie. Pixar also made the effort to add another level of detail to the movie by also developing the relationships between Mater and McMissile as well as Ms. Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) the new agent in training. However, this is also a kids' movie and most of the younger audience will not really appreciate the character development Pixar has in this film. Instead the younger generation was more interested in the action and excitement the movie had the offer. Pixar's clever mind has once again found a way to make an idea work as they have brilliantly integrated weapons, martial arts, and gadgets into the car universe. I was impressed by how Pixar kept the scenes interesting and pretty diverse which kept the action and gadget use fun. Mater's idiotic use of gadgets and innocent humor was also well balanced and fun which kept me and the rest of the audience into the movie. <br/><br/>This brings me to my next topic: the action has made the movie more mature. I was surprised by the amount of explosions, gun use, and death in this movie. A lot of the darkness, evil plotting, and shooting I felt was a bit too James Bond like for younger audiences and seemed to make this movie shift more towards adults. Also I felt the action in this film took away a lot of the emotional buildup the first movie had, which was one of the aspects I enjoyed most about that film. Although Pixar still had emotional development between Mater and the spy cars, it still was as impacting as McQueen's emotional journey with Radiator Springs. I also was not as impressed with the racing scenes as in the first film. The spy action took a lot of screen time, which resulted in the actual race being replaced with small snippets of high adrenaline, engine roaring, or race car taunting, mainly from John Turturro.<br/><br/>Overall Cars 2 is one of the better sequels I have seen in a while and is still as fun and brilliantly shot as its predecessor. The voice work is well placed, the action is fun and exciting, and the comedy is still the same throughout the movie. However, I still miss that emotion between McQueen and the radiator springs crew, especially from Doc and wished they would have put a little more involvement with the rest of radiator springs. Overall I give this movie an 8.0 or 8.5 for that same Pixar magic. I again wish to remind parents that there is a little more maturity in this movie than expected and would probably say this is more of a PG movie than a G. Regardless it's definitely worth seeing, especially for Mater fans, and would even be worth seeing in 3D assuming you don't get sick and are willing to pay the price. <br/><br/>Until then keep enjoying the movies!"
"big_ryan15","8","2","5","26 June 2011"," Pixar deserves a lap of honour! 12 straight hits!
","Let me start out by saying this in no way is a movie for children. Animation is considered an art form, my father in law believes it to be nothing more than kids movies. How wrong is he? You'll know the answer after walking out of Cars 2 with a smile on your face. All the lovable characters from the first movie return, with bigger roles along with a few fresh new faces. We say goodbye to dear old Radiator Springs pretty early on, but hello to rest of the world. Lightning McQueen is invited to take art in the WORLD GRAND PRIX, run by a Billionaire Jeep that has created an alternative fuel to replace gas. Fun ensues. With the leap in technology since the first film, Pixar brings even further into the movie by using incredible point of view shots from inside the car and next to it, you can really feel how fast the cars are travelling. I would love to see the networks stacks Pixar uses to render the countries used in this movie because WOW are they pretty. We see France, Italy, Japan; its all so pretty. The Story of Cars 2 cruises at a good pace, introducing all the important players from the start. Michael Cain here as Finn MacMissile is great, easily the best part of the movie. The action is heart pounding and the heart that Mater brings to this action movie is a tremendous object to balance the film. I wont go too far into the story line, just know that this is more Jason Bourne or Daniel Craig's James Bond than it is anything else. Gritty, cartoonishly violent and over the top. The visuals here are insane and the story (as Pixar's always done) has hugely deep under currents all the way through it, from death and extortion, to gambling, match fixing, deceit and the race to find a greener way for human kind to exist. Im so glad Pixar is taking steps toward more openly adult films, hopefully the can shrug the childish stigma attached to them.<br/><br/>I look more and more forward to their next epic ""BRAVE"". If its half as good as CARS 2, they wont have to worry about unlucky 13.<br/><br/>Also, seeing Buzz and Woody on screen again during their short at the beginning of the film mad it more than worth the $10 ticket.<br/><br/>8/10 Not their best, but still leaps and bounds ahead of any other animation studios out there,"

","Pixar's Cars was easily their weakest feature, yet it certainly had a charm to it. While the car characters themselves looked a little cheap, the world they lived in had nice, pretty detail, and their Rocky Mountain hometown was lovely. Cars 2 not only replaces Cars as Pixar's weakest, it's actually dishearteningly awful. It jettisons every ounce of charm from the original, as well as the detail (probably because it was made as a 3D movie, so the backgrounds aren't going to be seen anyway), and puts Larry the freakin' Cable Guy in the lead (Owen Wilson's Lightning McQueen is barely even in the film, and would probably be like fourth billed if not for his contract). This film belongs on the shelf next to Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector and Witless Protection, not Wall-E and Up. The plot has McQueen and 'Mater (Larry's character, if you don't know) going around the world to a series of races so McQueen can prove he's the fastest car alive. 'Mater is mistaken for a secret agent by a James Bond-like Michael Caine-mobile and Emily Mortimer and has to foil an evil plot by someone or other. I really couldn't be bothered to give a damn about any of it. It's very busy, and I'm sure small children will like it, but it's vapid as Hell. It really feels like one of those Disney direct-to-DVD sequels, possibly even worse. Let's hope Pixar will learn its lesson from this one."

","Cars 2 Directed by: John Lasseter & Brad Lewis Written by: Ben Queen Produced by: Denise Ream Released in theaters June 24, 2011<br/><br/>My Rating: ★★★★★<br/><br/>This film is rated G.<br/><br/>Most of the original Cars favorites are back, with tons of fantastic new characters, like Finn McMissle (Michael Caine) and Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro). This time, McQueen (Owen Wilson) and his motley pit crew take on the entire world (Tokyo, Italy, and London) as they participate in a World Grand Prix sponsored by the new green fuel, Allinol. As Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) whole-heartedly supports his best buddy, while sometimes embarrassing him with his redneck quirkiness, he is mistaken by two British operatives for an American government contact. The road gets a little bumpy when Lightning and Mater have a bit of a falling out, and Mater is pulled farther and farther into international espionage. Finally, Mater must make a critical choice that could save his best friend, even if it means the great junkyard in the sky for him.<br/><br/>When my oldest son was around the age of my youngest son, he would watch Cars over and over all day, every day! I can probably still recite the entire movie to you, word for word. To this day, it remains a favorite in our house.<br/><br/>Most, if not all, of the familiar voices have returned for this new motor-powered adventure. Tow Mater seems to take the lead this time, as he is inadvertently taken for an international spy and tossed right in the middle of a jalopy uprising. I was pleased to find Mater had more on-screen time, not just because he is a ""southerner"" like me, but also because he is just so darn lovable and funny! <br/><br/>While this film is certainly not short on humor, it is also much more action-packed than its prequel. The spy cars, even Mater eventually, come fully loaded with automatic grappling hooks, machine guns, and missile launchers. While the plot of this story was undoubtedly all in great fun and entertainment, even my six-year-old commented on the bombs and guns. Perhaps it was a little more intense than what some people would prefer.<br/><br/>The graphics were superb, of course. We did not see the 3D version of the film (I try to avoid these as much as I can!), but the colors popped and the story came to life before our eyes. The soundtrack is subtle, but fun, including a track from Weezer. The cast was spot-on. Michael Caine was the perfect choice for the British spy, Finn McMissle. I was sad that Doc Hudson was not included in this film (though he was honored near the beginning), but I later learned this was in respect to and in memory of the late Paul Newman. Other voice actors who were lost prior to the filming of Cars 2 include George Carlin (Fillmore) and Joe Ranft (Red), but these characters remain in the story. <br/><br/>Overall, this film was fantastic, and I know it will join our home movie collection when it is released on DVD and Blu-ray. My entire family gives it an energetic ""KA-CHOW!""<br/><br/>This review can also be found at www.gatheringleavesreviews.blogspot.com and www.journalstone.com."

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","4","1","2","27 August 2018"," Easily PIXAR's worst outing to date.
","The Cars franchise is something of a stigma among the collective PIXAR fandom: it's detested by the stingiest fans and for good reason, it's not a movie series that exists for good stories but for the merchandising side of things. When you see the Toy Story sequels and see what makes for GOOD animated filmmaking, Cars 2 is the antithesis of the Toy Story sequels in every discernible way. The characters haven't really changed and the James Bond-styled caper doesn't save the film from its underwhelming story and non-existent character development. With that said, the animation's still good: almost too good for this $200 million production that exists to sell more Cars toys.<br/><br/>Cars may boast nice visuals, but the movies aren't the kind which have clear rhyme or reason to exist. Cars 2 is animation done without creative flare. 2/5 stars."

","Like many I was very impress with Cars it is one of the most clever animation films we had in a long time. That still remains one of my favorite films I saw in theaters.<br/><br/>However Cars 2 does nothing to hold water to the first film as a matter of fact it should have never been created it is one of the most disappointing sequels in the history of sequels and it is not even worth being consider a direct to video release.<br/><br/>I apologize that is a insult to direct to video releases because there are direct to video releases that would kick this one to the curve. <br/><br/>They change the roles of Lighting McQueen and Mater making Mater the story protagonist and central character How could you think that would be a good idea? You can't just switch the protagonists and expect it to work. It can't.<br/><br/>The plot for the film totally takes away what makes the first film a joy to watch. It just really destroy it. <br/><br/>The animation is very well done and pretty much the only good thing I have say about this film. The voice acting rage from good to just stupid also some of the new characters look better on paper.<br/><br/>I give Cars 2 an 5 out of 10 and this is being nice"

","While Pixar has its finest moments this is not one of them.First of all,the series in general is not creative.Cars talking?Not very fun or creative.But you know what is creative Monsters,Bugs talking,Toys talking,Fish talking,Robot Love,and a man on a adventure with his house carried by balloons,etc.Personally I think Pixar has been writing out of ideas recently.Cars 1 and 2 were not creative and just plain annoying.Brave was also not creative,but my one exception was Monsters University sure it had its bad moments but it had heartfelt moments which have been with Pixar for all this time.Cars 2 was not heartfelt as it was just plain annoying as Mater (played by Larry the Cable Guy) made me want to shoot myself.And the plot isn't fun either who wants to see a movie with the plot about secret agent Cars and Mater as one of them. Hopefully Pixar never makes films like these again."
"kimbistrups","4","1","2","20 October 2013"," So wrong, so bad and so uninteresting!
","First of I want to make it very clear that I'm a huge Disney/Pixar fan. I own all of the feature length films they have ever put out on DVD, I watch them regularly and I enjoy them very much. To me what makes them special is that they represent the highest quality of animated films in that while they are expertly executed and produced they are also imaginative, innovative, interesting, engaging and funny. This goes, in my opinion, for all of Disney/Pixars 14 feature length films out on DVD with the one sad exception of Cars 2.<br/><br/>The story in itself is without a doubt the weakest and least imaginative of all the Disney/Pixar movies to date (I haven't yet seen Planes, but I'm not exactly holding my breath for that one either). I fail to see how the executives at Disney/Pixar could be fooled by a plot that is so thin and uninteresting that it makes the Tinker Bell movies seem levels above.<br/><br/>And what on earth possessed Mr. Lasseter to make him ""okay"" the ridiculous levels of violence and weaponry displayed in the movie. And how did he think that a spy movie would be interesting to children. I have watched it with children ages 8, 9 and 12. They all had a hard time following the plot, and while the smaller ones were scared at times the big one simply wasn't drawn in at all.<br/><br/>As others have said before me, it seems that this movie (and the ""Planes"" spin off) was only made to make money on more merchandise. What I don't understand is, why they had to change the whole concept of the first movie ""Cars"" that centered around old fashioned values and friendship into some deranged global good/bad war over fossil fuel/CO2 neutral fuel. I just don't get it. And I didn't like.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this film to anyone who liked the other Disney/Pixar movies. And I must say that it has been a great relief to me that Brave and Monsters University both proved to be back to the old standards - and I'm very apprehensive about Planes..."

","Cars 2 is actually not a half-bad film as many people are claiming it to be. It's a sequel to the 2006's hit Pixar film, Cars. While Cars turned out to be weakest film Pixar has ever made, it still had a heart and a message. It was more about the drama and relationships between the characters rather than action. Unfortunately, this is the first Pixar film to lack that heart and to substitute it for plain action. As an action fan, I really liked this move. As a Pixar fan, I was wondering what the heck happened.<br/><br/>Our heroes Lightning McQueen and Mater returns as they travel worldwide to race in the World Grand Prix. But while there, Mater seems to have been caught up in some kind of international conspiracy.<br/><br/>The voice actors are pretty good. I wanted to see more Owen Wilson as McQueen because I felt he wasn't in the movie enough as this film was based more on Mater voiced by Larry the Cable Guy.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good movie if you don't associate it with Pixar. I enjoyed the action scenes and the crisp animation, but I couldn't help feel disappointed that this is not the Pixar film we have came to expect. I rate this film 7/10."

","The biggest problem with this movie is not the guns, tasers, murders or too much Mater. It's the characters. In the first movie both McQueen and Doc Hudson have interesting character arcs. Lightning discovers that friendship and 'doing the right thing' is more important than winning the Piston Cup. Doc finally makes peace with himself, reveals his secret and returns to the racing world. We also get to know Sally's story and the tale of Radiator Springs. The town in fact is a character on it's own. It's changes during the movie. It has a history. It has heart. <br/><br/>I can't find any of this in Cars 2. It's a pseudo-James Bond story build around slapstick jokes and fancy CGI tricks. Sure is looks great, but it lacks character. There is not one scene that comes close to -let's say- Doc Hudson racing in the desert, Guido's Pitstop or Lightning pushing The King across the finish line. <br/><br/>This is why me and my daughter keep on watching the first Cars movie. It doesn't have guns or flying cars. It has a heart... and Doc Hudson."

","Pixar takes audiences back into the world of cars in this sequel to the 2006 hit. Lightning McQueen, having achieved much fame and success for his multiple Piston Cup awards, returns home to Radiator Springs to take a break and bond with his best friend Mater. Having been goaded by the supercilious Francesco Bernoulli, McQueen decides to enter the World Grand Prix and takes pal Mater along with him, but things quickly go askew when a case of mistaken identity plunges Mater deep into an espionage plot. Fantastic animation (especially key locations throughout Europe), and a stellar cast of voices can't overcome the clichéd themes and convoluted plot which even adults may have trouble trying to comprehend. Shows some life in its third act with relentless action scenes, but the film's overall impact is muted. **"
"apezy-mcqueen","10","1","2","2 January 2012"," I LOVE this film!
","I have seen every single Disney movie, and Disney Pixar movie, and I feel that this movie in NO WAY falls short. Many critics are calling the story line too confusing or complex for younger audiences, but let's be honest - all children's movies contain hidden story lines that only older audiences can fully grasp. My eight year old cousin follows it easily, in fact he even explained some of it to me. Children younger than that don't look for anything more than the obvious storyline they can see - that there are cars and they are friends and they race. Every child I have talked to has loved this film, and seeing as this is Disney's target audience, I say this film reached its goal. What's more is, if the story line was less complex, adults would have the same moan or complaint of the age-old ""same-old-same-old"" story line, the complaint of all Disney movies being the same with different characters. This film is different, and yes it has ditz and dazzle, that's what kids like. <br/><br/>I was not expecting so much from a sequel, as films normally drop in greatness in sequels. But this film blew me away, gave Mater the recognition he deserved whilst keeping Mcqueen in the front lines, and the characters did not change who they are from the first film. It was brilliant. <br/><br/>Great film Disney :)"

","Violence taking over..., again, Cars 2 simple example This could have been a nice movie if there wouldn't be this disgusting display of culture of violence. When do you start to understand that this is really showing cheap in-mature values. Like this movie Cars 2, many other 'part 2' movies showing signs of the same development: part one, mostly good entertainment with mostly an interesting story, than, when they come to part two, the display of disgusting violent scenes takes over. Cars 2 is abuse of power: Audience is expecting a family movie similar to part 1. Creating violent movies as Cars 2 is an abuse of the arrogant American film industry against normal people not only in the US but also world wide. America's Culture of Violent Movies Infect the World and Itself. Maybe it's rather dumb, naive, irresponsible, uneducated than arrogant. Cars 2 is a good example of the cheap in-mature US movies industry: Violence is greatly revered in the United States, and Cars 2 will add more to it. Amer­i­can violent culture is every­where, Cars 2 productions is a good example why. Violence has become associated with the Amer­i­can movie industry. Wake up, make better movies.

","The first ""Cars' and ""Cars 2"" bear little resemblance to each other. While the former was set in a small western town in the USA, and involved a car ""coming of age"", this new one features a car that gets involved in auto racing all over the world. <br/><br/>And it isn't just racing, there is intrigue. It involves a new, environmentally-friendly fuel and those who may want to see it fail.<br/><br/>Larry the Cable Guy is arguably the star as the voice of Mater, as in ""Tow Mater"", the country bumpkin tow truck that just seems out of place everywhere he goes, but in the end is the key to solving the mystery. <br/><br/>I am not a big fan of the actor, Owen Wilson, but here as the voice of Lightning McQueen he is just perfect.<br/><br/>The story is incidental, but it makes for several opportunities to feature road races in some very famous places, like Monte Carlo and London.

","The original 'Cars' was okay. An innovative, fresh, humorous and peculiar approach on an animated movie. Although with flaws, at least it had some soul and character.<br/><br/>This one? No way! Let me start by saying that the animation is excellent combined with even more complex and ""ambitious"" scenarios than the original's (more light and more color too) but both the plot and the humor fail miserably. <br/><br/>One of the many problems of this movie is the fact that it takes place in many countries. Stories set in several places around the world just don't work (see the case of ""Love Actually""!). I gotta admit, there are awesome sceneries of Japan and Italy, but in London they made the Big Ben look so phony. I wonder if they did that intentionally? Perhaps. Being a sequel, logic isn't the 1st, 2nd, not even 22nd priority.<br/><br/>Unlike the original, Mater is the leading character. The film is practically about him. Mater was funny in the original. Here he tries too hard to be funny and as a consequence he becomes too clownish, even irritating.<br/><br/>It was actually hilarious when Mater ate that icecream and urgently needed to drink water because it was too spicy for him. Anyway, the ""joke"" of Mater going to the bathroom and afterwards farting was too much. Mater is even confounded with an international spy, for dang sake!<br/><br/>They attempted to repeat some of the jokes from the first movie, but none of them worked the way they did in the first one: the famous ""ka-chow"" line and the joke of the tractors, for instance.<br/><br/>Doc Hudson is missing, perhaps because Paul Newman has passed. They mentioned Doc Hudson, but the way they were referring to him makes one think he probably died - either that or else he migrated."
"dvc5159","6","1","2","29 August 2011"," This is PIXAR's worst film. Meaning not bad by usual standards.
","Once in a while, top-notch filmmakers and/or big stars take a break from making their usual brilliant passion projects, and go to do something fun, just to lighten their brain before preparing for the next big thing. James Cameron had ""True Lies"" in between his epic/sci-fi extravaganzas. Before ""Unforgiven"" Clint Eastwood made the buddy cop thriller ""The Rookie"". Edward Zwick who is known for his big-scale action epics like ""The Last Samurai"" and ""Blood Diamond"" made the sexually charged comedy ""Love and Other Drugs"" last year. The best example is probably Steven Spielberg, who can balance crowd-pleasing blockbusters ""Indiana Jones"", ""Jurassic Park"" to hard-hitting historical dramas ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Munich""; and still have room for more.<br/><br/>PIXAR is no different. However, most of the critical backlash seems to be programmed disappointment for the sequel to arguably PIXAR's weakest film, at least before this. Granted the first ""Cars"" wasn't as excellent as PIXAR's other efforts, but I appreciated the ""small-town values"" message it was trying to convey.<br/><br/>Right off the bat let me start by saying that ""Cars 2"" is PIXAR's worst film by far. But ""worst"" by PIXAR's standards is ""OK"" for overall movies. It's still watchable and enjoyable, though not as heartfelt, emotional or intelligent as previous PIXAR outings such as ""Up"" and ""WALL-E"". PIXAR just wants to have fun. Let them.<br/><br/>The thing that turned off the critics the most is the blatant change of pace from the previous film. ""Cars"" was a drama about appreciating small town values. ""Cars 2"" is an exciting fast-paced action-adventure in vein (and possibly in tribute) to the gadget-laden Roger Moore/Pierce Brosnan James Bond films. It does not have a heartfelt message. It does not try to do so. It aims to entertain. And I admit, being a James Bond film fan myself, it was very fun to watch.<br/><br/>The story shifts focus from Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) to Mater this time, though I wonder what the executives were thinking giving Larry The Cable Guy the lead in a PIXAR movie. But never mind. Mater comes across as goofy and dim-witted as usual, but at some points I felt as if PIXAR was going to Dreamworks-type humor.<br/><br/>Having said that, I did enjoy Michael Caine, Emily Mortimer and Thomas Kretschmann as the new key characters to the franchise, and some of the action sequences are indeed exhilarating. Helped by solid voice work, fluid animation, gorgeous scenery that looks like the perfect travelogue, and frenetic and engaging music by Michael Giacchino (why hasn't EON Productions hired him for the next Bond film yet?) all combine to make a fun summer flick that entertains.<br/><br/>Critics have found ""Cars 2"" to be a tad too violent for kids. The James Bond movies (before Dalton) and the ""Indiana Jones"" films were mostly rated PG and had a variety of spectacular and dangerous stunts and innuendo and had people dying too, and yet families still bring their kids to watch (no wonder why the darker and more cruel ""Licence To Kill"" flopped). ""Tom and Jerry"" had the two fighting and bashing and blowing each other up in almost every episode, yet kids still watch (and love) that. ""Cars 2"" is no different, though I fear the backlash may be started for giving this a G rating instead of a PG.<br/><br/>But then, I have to criticize it for having poor characterization, a cookie-cutter story, some lame jokes and having almost no strong moral message like PIXAR movies usually do. Thought the ""alternative fuel"" was a nice touch though.<br/><br/>This blockbuster is good for parents who are willing to introduce their little boys to the James Bond films. Apart from that, let's hope PIXAR has had their fun and go back to serious business. The kind that makes another ""WALL-E"".<br/><br/>Overall rating: 60/100"

On the other hand, there is more of Mater whose child-like impulsiveness and good-heartedness (and slapstick tomfoolery) works on a very simple level.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it, and I enjoyed it quite a bit more than the first one."

","An animation movie is worth what's worth that's all. But this one has a whirl of stunning images and scenes technically almost perfect and extremely efficient and impressive. The humanized cars are greatly expressive in terms of ""facial"" and ""body"" features and gestures that make us always forget they aren't people. Their movements look human indeed. And we don't see a single human being all through the movie as if the world was peopled with cars behaving like people and showing human feelings and thoughts, some of them being the ""bad"" and some others the ""good"" ones. There also several good humoured sequences like those performed by the tow van character, a really well conceived one. And the reproduction of cities like Paris, London and Italy are very realistic and beautiful almost looking like photos. And the story? Well the story the less important aspect of the movie as it often happens in animation movies. Something about the use of car fuel, the very modern duel between petrol and alternative less polluting fuels which in this story involve a fight between the ""goodies"" who defend the former against the ""baddies"" that try to discredit it in favour of petrol by means of several criminal and violent actions.

Big disappointment"
"Scarlet-22","3","1","2","15 July 2011"," THIS is a G-Rated Movie?
","Throughout the entire time I was watching CARS 2 in a theater crowded with VERY young children, I found myself wondering if maybe I'd just misremembered the actual MPAA rating for this movie. I was pretty sure that the theater marquee, the ticket-purchasing website, even the movie's own marketing materials all stated that this movie was rated ""G"", ""Suitable for all audiences"", by the MPAA. But the on-screen product was telling me something far different. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, we see:<br/><br/>-- Cars ambushing a secret agent car (with the strong implication of a violent confrontation);<br/><br/>-- A warship turning guns on a fishing trawler, and;<br/><br/>-- A nail-biting car chase on an oceanic oil rig that wouldn't be out of place in a Bond or Bourne movie, complete with another spy car faking ""death"" after being shot at by a rocket launcher.<br/><br/>And, sadly, that's not even the WORST of what purports to be a ""G""-rated family film dishes out for its unsuspecting audience of kids and their by-now-shocked parents. A MAJOR plot point of the movie involves the villain using an instability in an alternative fuel source to deliberately blow up race cars using that same fuel. Yes, you read that right: A movie that features anthropomorphic cars as its characters has several scenes of anthropomorphic cars turned into unsuspecting bombs by their fuel source. This is as inappropriate for a ""G""-rated movie as it would be to have humans exploding because one of their food sources turns them into unsuspecting IEDs. This is not a movie for young children by any stretch of the imagination, and I'm not sure how a movie with this level of in-your-face explicit violence and mature content could possibly have gotten anything below PG-13.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it's also not a movie likely to appeal to older children, teens, or adults. The storyline is convoluted, and even an adult friend who saw it commented on how tough it was to follow all the plot points. The message of the movie gets completely lost in all the espionage nonsense; if John Lasseter is trying to make some point about corporate machinations getting in the way of truly pursuing alternatives to fossil fuels, he needed to make it a lot clearer than turning race cars running on ""Allinol"" into bombs and tossing in a throwaway line near the end about how McQueen escapes the other race cars' fate. And speaking of McQueen, he and most of the Radiator Springs residents are either missing completely or simply reduced to extras needed to fill out a scene. If you're not a fan of Larry the Cable Guy or the Tow Mater character, you should just skip this movie entirely, because Mater is front-and-center as the lead in this disaster.<br/><br/>This isn't to say that CARS 2 is completely without watchability. The visuals are amazing at times, and the level of detail in some of the scenes serve as a reminder of why Pixar is the undisputed King of Animated Features. And the opening animated short featuring the Toy Story characters is simply brilliant. It's also, alas, the best thing about CARS 2, and it's over in less than 5 minutes.<br/><br/>CARS 2 is a huge disappointment as a movie, and the one good thing that could come out of it is a serious discussion about creating a rating that fills the gap between ""Suitable for all Audiences"" and ""Parental Guidance Suggested""."

I attribute this to uninspired direction and editing, or maybe it was kept long to fit in all the ads. I was annoyed by all the product placements aimed at the kids.. and adults.

","Technically the film is flawless. Seeing the film one can't help admiring the progress CGI has made over the last decade, and the use of 3-D is not bad throughout the movie. You'd think that when Pixar's admirable staff couples with its obvious technical advantage, they'd be hit the bullseye again, and... the results are borderline disastrous.<br/><br/>There is a great premise here. Actually, a few premises that go nowhere because there is just too much happening, but it is all muddled as we try to keep up with a spy plot that is nothing but uninvolving, as it is herd to tell the good guys from the bad guys, and then we have the simpleton stuck in the middle of it, the fish out of water, the friendship angle, and all the cute stuff that might have been added in order to bring some charm here, or maybe it was just there because they could afford it.<br/><br/>It is a constant gabfest, and even the wondrous visuals feel bogged down as we have to constant to an endless series of conversations that are neither amusing, dramatic or clever, just way too long and at best flat. Pixar works best when the drama is clear, personal, simple. Who can forget the amazing personalities of the trio in ""Up"". The characters don't have to be people, look at Kevin and Dug. The family in ""The Incredibles"", and many more come to mind. There is just something forced about the characters in this film. They're underdeveloped, and we're supposed to like them. It's even more detrimental when the opening short has the fantastic characters from ""Toy Store"" take on a faux vacation and squeeze every possible laugh out of the short.<br/><br/>It is at least disappointing, and well, there is always an annual offering by Pixar, and next year's should be much better.

Cars are actually assassinated, and not the implied ""Mufasa falls into the stampede"" - but they explode or get crushed - on screen.<br/><br/>Beyond my disgust at the marketing as a children's movie, as an adult, it wasn't even interesting. The race scenes were much less exciting than the first, the flying cars were over-the-top, and worst - it wasn't funny. Basically it failed in every ""good movie"" category with the exception of special effects and sound editing (sort of like ""The Phantom Menace"").<br/><br/>What I want to know most is who at Pixar is going to lose their job because my 4-year-old cried during an animated Disney picture?"

Intertwined within this story is secret agen-err car, Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) who enlists the help of Mater to thwart the plans of the evil lemon cars, sick of being the laughing stock of the world. <br/><br/>Character-wise, the most noticeable difference in Cars 2 from the original is that Mater has made the jump to lead protagonist, while McQueen appears on occasion just to tie up the loose ends and advance the plot. The entire secret agent story is fantastical and a far cry from the more intimate setting of the first film, although that is unlikely to phase the film's target market. I could have gone without it, and yet cutting it out completely turns Cars 2 into a forty-minute TV special, as opposed to a feature-length presentation. So this is definitely a case of 'I don't know how to improve it, I just know I don't like it.'<br/><br/>I can understand applying the 'bigger is better' formula to such a sequel, but the increased screen time enjoyed by Mater is actually a detriment, as a character that outlandish is best taken in small doses. Having said that, the film does its best to draw sympathy from the audience in key scenes. We genuinely feel for Mater when his feelings get hurt, but such heartfelt moments (that have become one of Pixar's greatest weapons) are unfortunately dealt with all too quickly, and swiftly pushed aside to make room for the next big set piece.<br/><br/>Visual gags dominate the humour landscape of the film, which again should come as no surprise considering whom the film is aimed at. Because the events of this movie occur all over the world, it allows animators to apply all sorts of racial stereotypes for a cheap laugh. McQueen's Italian rival talks in a thick, cheesy accent, is painted the same colours as his national flag, and lists soccer as his favourite pastime. Comedy is not the film's strong suit, and generally fails to deliver any fresh material that may have otherwise made the film more engaging for us older kids.<br/><br/>Two minor areas in which Cars 2 falls flat are, ironically, two areas in which Pixar tends to excel. The film lacks a quality villain, one that appears genuinely threatening and capable of instilling fear like, say, Toy Story 3's Lotso. Also, subtle in-jokes regarding the state of pollution in the world, as well as the impending need to switch to alternative fuel feel uncharacteristically forced. Naturally, these moments are intended to fly right over a younger viewer's head, but they felt like nothing more than a guilt-trip to me.<br/><br/>Upon this film's release, many were inclined to argue that Pixar has finally sold out and produced a film solely for merchandising purposes. While this may be true to some extent, it's important to remember that it is only lacklustre by Pixar's high standards, and could have been far more painful under a lesser studio's supervision. Sure, this sequel does no more than simply go through the motions for ninety minutes, but remains a bearable (albeit somewhat unfulfilling) experience.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"
"tavm","8","1","2","29 June 2011"," Pixar's reputation doesn't deserve to be declining because of Cars 2's not being as creatively nourishing as before with the other movies
","You know, I had a feeling Pixar was going to have a backlash going against them someday and wasn't too surprised it was during the release of Cars 2, but I didn't think it would seem a 180 degree like I've assumed from many negative comments about this movie I've read here and other sites. Okay, in the interest of full disclosure, when I saw the trailer for this one and Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) made that joke about the pope-mobile and about having ""average intelligence"", I wasn't sure I wanted to see it. But now that I have, I'll now say that I highly enjoyed this almost as much as I've enjoyed the previous ones made by this highly creative company. Action scenes are great, there are plenty of humorous moments that are easily laughable mostly concerning Mater, and I liked the additions of Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) as British spies mistaking Mater for a fellow agent. And Owen Wilson as Lightning McQueen is still useful as a character despite not being on screen as much as in the previous Cars. So on that note, I highly recommend Cars 2 to anyone who's willing to not let Pixar's reputation bring them down simply because this one isn't as creatively nourishing as those previous others. P.S. I also had a nice laugh when Brent Musburger became the voice of Brent Mustangburger."

","Do I even bother? I liked this as a kid. Why? I have absolutely no idea.<br/><br/>In Cars 2, Lightening McQueen takes to the world stage and races against global racers. He struggles to keep up with the best of the best. However, while this is all going on, somehow Mater falls into being a spy. There's like a conspiracy and espionage and a whole pile of strange dealings.<br/><br/>The issues with this movie can be broken down as four things. Firstly, they introduce a really mediocre set of characters that fails in comparison to the set of characters from Cars 1. There's a reason none of them feature in Cars 3. They don't have personalities and are barely more than just thoughts.<br/><br/>Secondly, the plot doesn't really go anywhere. There are so many changes in direction it feels stationary. The plot twists feel like they were thrown in last minute. Who came up with this and thought it was a good idea? Like I sat there in such a confusion. I, an adult, couldn't work out where it was going at all. One of the best parts of spy movies is guessing what is going to happen. But you can't even do that, because the information required isn't revealed until forty seconds before it is revealed. Frustrating is an understatement.<br/><br/>Thirdly. I just can't with the soundtrack. The soundtrack of Cars was brilliant. The soundtrack of Cars 2 is comparatively nothing. I didn't feel like it had really anything to do with the actual movie. And it's not the songs chosen are bad, they aren't. It's just they don't feel like they were thought out and placed with the same intention of Cars. I read up about Cars and they picked Chuck Berry song that his record company didn't even know existed. That same level of thought was not put in for Cars 2.<br/><br/>Finally, I have a theory. I think Pixar wanted to make a spy movie. And they realised that it would be hard to create spy characters that kids could empathise with and tell the entire story they had planned. So they did something I have never seen Pixar do before. They didn't even try. They just bent tried and tested characters to a story they like and rolled with it. I am sorry but for me that is not good enough.<br/><br/>I don't know if I have ever been so disappointed. Really not worth watching."

"tomgillespie2002","4","1","3","20 November 2017"," Feels like a straight-to-DVD short stretched out over 106 minutes
","Pixar's Cars is now remembered as one of the great studio's rare misfires; a formulaic animated movie that had far more to offer to the children in the audience than to the adults paying for them to be there (although I think it's one of their most misunderstood movies and well worth a re-visit). Despite this, it was a box-office smash and a dream in terms of merchandising. A few years ago, Pixar may have thought twice about extending the story of Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) and the town of Radiator Springs without having something new to say, but ever since Disney took over, they've taken a more relaxed attitude towards bending to audience demand and churning out an underdeveloped and unworthy sequel. The result is Cars 2, a mess of a movie with an absence of any real laughs that feels like a straight-to-DVD short stretched out over 106 minutes.<br/><br/>Now a four-time Piston Cup champion, the world-famous Lightning McQueen returns to Radiator Springs to see his old friends, much to the delight of best chum Mater (Larry the Cable Guy). However, formula champion Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro) challenges McQueen to join him in the World Grand Prix, an event created by Sir Miles Axelrod (Eddie Izzard) to advertise his new fuel Allinol. McQueen, along with Mater, Luigi (Tony Shalhoub), Guido (Guido Quaroni), Fillmore (Lloyd Sherr) and Sarge (Paul Dooley), heads to Tokyo, where Mater's buffoonish behaviour starts to grate on the racing star. Meanwhile, weapons designer Professor Zundapp (Thomas Kretschmann) and his cronies are taking out cars using an electromagnetic pulse in an attempt to scupper Axelrod's plans and secure oil profits. This catches the attention of international super-spy Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and his partner Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer), who mistake Mater for a fellow spy and hire the clueless tow truck to help with their mission.<br/><br/>This may sound like a bold move for a franchise built on low-key themes of friendship and humility around a traditional fish-out-of- water story, and Cars 2 fleetingly captures the imagination as McMissile swings onto an enemy oil rig, gadgets at the ready. But this is no longer Lightning McQueen's story. Instead, they push Mater, the comic relief best served in tiny doses, front and centre. Not only do his shenanigans increasingly annoy, they are also painfully unfunny. Many of the memorable supporting cast from the first movie are either heavily sidelined or given the boot altogether, and the story is so disjointed that it's difficult to keep up with the endless roster of forgettable, newly-introduced characters. Kids will love it though, and that's all that really matters when it comes to box-office receipts. There's enough colour, slapstick and racing action to keep them on their seats, and the animation again is truly wonderful. While this may get a pass if released by Dreamworks, mediocrity never used to be on Pixar's radar, and the high standards are still expected. One need only look at their Toy Story trilogy to see how inspired their sequels can be, which makes the middling antics of Cars 2 all the more crushing."
"datautisticgamer-74853","4","1","3","17 July 2016"," It improves on the first Cars, but only marginally
","Cars 2 was a movie that I expected, hands down, to be Pixar's worst movie. And after seeing it, it actually isn't, though the amount of polarization it has is close to films like Robin Hood or The Good Dinosaur, except worse. The story throughout most of the film is rather clunky and often goes by way too inconsistently (the last act nearly fixes this), doesn't solve questions we had about its universe in the first Cars, and preaches some questionable and even objectionable messages (some comments detail this). The sole undeniable plus about this film is its animation (because, you know, Pixar), depicting the settings superbly and with so many colors, even if it depicts more explosions than a Michael Bay movie. The characters are the most mixed of all, though the highest point they can reach is the tolerable-yet-forgettable zone. The James Bond style characters introduced here were closer to the top than the racing characters, especially Francesco. For most of the movie, Mater was quite boring or insufferable, though inched his way more towards tolerable by the last act. It all sums up to be a movie that I would advise you skip, no matter how much it improves its elements compared to Cars."

","We start off with Agent Finn McMissile riding out to a bunch of oil rigs that are on fire (I'm no mechanic but I'm pretty sure that oil and fire should be kept as far away from each other as possible). Anyway, he sees Professor Z (Zündapp) look at a video camera and goes to get a closer look (and the professor is German because, well, the Germans have already given us Uwe Boll, The Human Centipede, and both world wars). We then cut to the town and meet Lightning and the other characters including Mater, the star of this movie. Meanwhile, Lightning spends some time with his girlfriend Sally at a restaurant where the learn that an oil tycoon named Miles Axel is organizing a worldwide race, which Lightning gets invited to join even though he's supposedly on vacation. Sally forces him to take Mater along and they head for Towkyo (that's not a typo). The movie then takes a break to have them see the sights before cutting to Mater acting like an idiot and embarrassing Lightning, who's meeting this Italian car that he will be competing against. While all this is happening Finn meets someone called Holly and they decide that they need to find another agent. Meanwhile, Mater mistakes wasabi for ice cream and rushes to a water fountain (FYI: water inflames the taste of spicy food. You want to drink milk). Then some goons attack an agent in the bathroom and the agent puts his tracking beacon on Mater. So Holly thinks that Mater's a spy and Mater thinks he's got a date. It's now revealed that Allinol becomes extremely dangerous when hit by an electromagnetic pulse, so we now have a torture scene. The agent being tortured reveals that Mater is the spy. While Lightning is racing, the evil spies use the camera to blow the racers' engines. Holly hijacks Mater's communication, which somehow causes Lightning to lose the race, and when confronted, Mater says that his girlfriend is just a voice in his head. In both movies Mater makes Patrick Star look like a genius, now he's apparently schizophrenic as well. Mater is thinking about going home but Finn interrupts him and explains that there's suspicion that Allinol could have caused the crashes. Mater goes back with Finn and Holly to their layer, where they look at a picture that they managed to take. Finn and Holly think that the photo is a dead end but Mater notices a bunch of boxes hidden in it, which apparently Finn and Holly didn't notice. That's the only thing of interest in the photo! They never would have passed kindergarten, let alone spy training! The cars then head to Italy and Finn and Holly try to disguise Mater. For the final disguise, they have to fix Mater's dents, thus prompting Mater to boast about how he got his dents from hanging out with Lightning. If that's the case, then how come he was dented even before he met Lightning? This is where we learn about the term ""lemon"" from Mater, cars that don't ever work right. All the cars in this plot are lemons. Meanwhile, Lightning partakes in the second part of the race, which as a whole should have been the focus of the entire movie. Holly then asks a tow truck for help, planning to replace him with Mater. The problem is that Mater has a very distinct voice, so hopefully they'll do something to change it. But instead they have him not talk but he accidentally does so and gets caught. The next scene features a whole bunch of cars at a meeting. I can't help but that in this scene there's a bowl of fruit on the table, so I guess there's organic matter in this world after all. The boss then talks to them through a video that only shows his butt (do cars have-oh never mind). Why can't he do use an intercom if he doesn't want to be seen? Anyway, he tells them they're all outdated models and nobody makes parts for them anymore. That's like not making pacemakers anymore because the only people who use them are too old! I won't give away the rest but this is certainly a car-wreck."

"CinemaClown","Null","1","3","14 April 2015"," Pixar's Weakest Film To Date!
","From its debut in 1995 to its most successful film in 2010, Pixar Animation Studios released 11 feature-length films, almost all of which went on to garner them acclaim, love & respect from critics n viewers around the world, completely reinvented the animation industry in the process, and also turned this animation powerhouse into one of world cinema's finest.<br/><br/>But everything that has a beginning has an end & there's always a first time for all things. And Cars 2 marks something of a first for Pixar; it's their first critical failure which ultimately marks the end of the winning streak the studio had kept alive since its inception. However, what's even more disappointing is that they actually decided to make a sequel to Cars!<br/><br/>Cars 2 follows the story of race car Lightning McQueen & tow truck Mater who together travel to Japan & Europe to take part in the World Grand Prix, arranged by a former oil tycoon to promote his biofuel. But when Mater inadvertently costs McQueen his first race & is asked to leave by him, he ends up finding himself caught in an international espionage.<br/><br/>Directed by John Lasseter, Cars 2 takes everything that was wrong with its predecessor & turns it even worse. I don't really know if Disney pushed Pixar for this sequel because of the billions of dollars it earned through Cars' merchandising or if Lasseter truly wanted to return to the picture that barely managed to keep its streak alive. Either way, it definitely isn't Pixar-level cinema.<br/><br/>The plot adapts the same clichéd international espionage we're seen many times before & this is coming from the studio that always brought something new to the table. The runtime is much longer than it needs to be, characters in this franchise were never interesting but now, they're annoying too. Its timid attempts at humour falls apart on most occasions. But its computer animation does carry the Pixar trademark.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Cars 2 is an unnecessary sequel that shouldn't have existed in the first place. It might be the best one can come up with when having Mater as the lead character but when the first film already warned that people are not interested in these characters, then making a second chapter was absolutely pointless. All in all, after continuously raising the bar during their rise to the top, Pixar at last comes crashing down with Cars 2 & the fall has been so traumatic that it's yet to fully recover from it."

Yes, it may not be exactly like other Pixar movies, but hey! You can't expect them to make artistic movies all time. The animation is fantabulous. Especially the scenes in London and Italy, the background imagery was very realistic. The action sequences in this spy game are again mesmerizing. For someone who dreams to have torpedoes and stun-guns fitted to his/her car, this movie is a real dream come true. Visually the scenes are mind-blowing. Radiator springs with its usual canyon looks, Tokyo with an array of display lights, Italy with the beautiful reverie like setting and finally London with its Bentley Ben (Big Ben) and the Queen of course!

","I loved this movie. It was a little better than the first (except for the loss of Paul Newman and Hudson Hornet). I loved the James Bond car (Aston Martin V12 Vanguish) and the Bond-style spy storyline. I don't understand why this movie got mixed reviews. It was full of action, just not so much that it was not appropriate for children. Children can indeed watch this without parents worrying. <br/><br/>Lightning McQueen has just won his fourth Piston Cup, now renamed the Hudson Hornet Piston Cup, and is resting in Radiator Springs. While watching a TV call-in show, Mater is angered by negative remarks made about his best friend and calls in. He accidentally gets McQueen entered in the first World Grand Prix. <br/><br/>The World Grand Prix is set up by a wealthy oil entrepreneur named Miles Axelrod. Axelrod has swapped to an electric car and is introducing alternative fuel. <br/><br/>At a party in Japan, Mater interrupts a fight between an American secret agent named Rod Redline (Dodge Challenger) and unknowingly leaves with a vital item that Rod leaves on him. Rod is abducted by the evil lemons (defective cars) and is forced by fear to reveal who he left the item with. Finn McMissile, the ""Cars"" version of James Bond, finds Mater and takes him along on his mission. Mater, thinking the female spy Holley Shiftwell (Jaguar XJ220) is his new girlfriend, has no idea what he is truly in for. <br/><br/>The lemons are out to make newer well-made cars look awful so everyone will go back to regular gasoline. <br/><br/>Mater's automotive expertise solves the case and finds the real culprit who is the leader of the lemons and deliberately interfering with the World Grand Prix and hurting the race cars. <br/><br/>I believe anyone could really enjoy this movie, whether or not you have children. From age 6 to 106, you will have loads of fun with this movie. Mater, as always, will have you laughing so loud, they'll hear you down the street. <br/><br/>Some people were angered about the addition of the violence and the ""kill McQueen"" sub-plot and the fact that Rod Redline (an American spy car) is ""tortured"" and killed in a scene. This is not a perfect world and there are indeed criminals who do awful things. The cartoon violence here is not offensive. It's what we call ""make-believe"" and ""fantasy"" for a reason. Children see the same level (or even worse level) of violence with cartoons such as Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers, and more. <br/><br/>As usual with Hollywood, the heroes (Lightning, Mater, Finn, and the other protagonists) come out alive and unharmed and return home happy and thankful. <br/><br/>A few complaints were also brought up from people who were ""shocked"" that the movie wrote that Hudson Hornet had died. I don't understand why. It would not have been the same with somebody else providing his voice. That belonged to Paul Newman and to him only. <br/><br/>The addition of Michael Caine as Finn was an awesome choice. He is an awesome actor and very talented, including voice acting. Owen Wilson once again gave a great performance as Lightning. Larry the Cable Guy is not my favorite comedian, but he did a great job as the ""foolish"" Mater. <br/><br/>I wish they had brought back Junior (Dale Earnhardt Jr) and Michael Shumacher's Ferrarri. I missed them.<br/><br/>All together, I greatly recommend this to anyone of all ages. This is the best sequel to any movie ever. In fact, I am going to watch it again right now.

","Cars 2 is a fun movie to watch. As we have all come to expect from Pixar the movie is visually stunning.

Pixar's creation of this car world is highly intelligent and I was thoroughly amused.<br/><br/>The plot involves a lot of action, humor and generally good entertainment but adopts a more conventional mainstream action/mystery/adventure form. I suppose it has detracted a little from the usual Pixar method, which is to get the viewer emotionally engaged. The emotional engagement made Pixar's work special and Cars 2 is not really as special as Pixar's previous work.<br/><br/>But there is no doubt that Cars 2 is entertaining. Ratings are a relative scale, and the rating for Cars 2 is only low because we've come to expect so much from Pixar. Any let down therefore is a severe blow.

I thought he had such a vivacious personality which in the end shined through and is just that goofy best bud you have. Lightning McQueen is that spiffy 'ol friend who has it all but has a heart and has good intentions. Then there's Sally who's lighthearted and looking out for her boyfriend and her boyfriend's buddy. But now, onto our new slue of cars.<br/><br/>Another complaint I heard was too many cars. Too many cars? We must've seen the wrong movie. Each and every car was developed to satisfaction and I thought every performance was a solid one. Pixar still has it in the bag. Furthermore, the animation is just absolutely outstanding. Visually, this is probably an Oscar contender. It's just so beautiful to look at and you're so easily immersed with this beauty. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the story. I thought it was pretty neat to try to reach to other countries and have some foreign appeal. Very good tie-in. I also thought the eco-friendly message was great too and this movie is just very strong in morals. <br/><br/>And folks, that's where all the positives stop. What are the problems? First and foremost, the pacing. The movie starts out pretty fun and upbeat, but it just sags as the film progresses. Had it not been for the sagging issue, this would be a solid 7. Moving on, the plot is unnecessarily convoluted and rather than exciting the viewer, sometimes leaves it in the dust. <br/><br/>Also, if you're wondering whether to pay those hefty 3D surcharges, save your cash. I thought since it was filmed in 3D and it was a very vibrant film, rich with detail and color, that it'd pop. Nope. The same 'ol 2D picture but with an edge. And those AMC IMAX's? PA-THETIC! I saw Cars 2 in IMAX 3D at an AMC chain. Worst. mistake. ever. You pay almost double your ticket for a screen slightly bigger and the sound slightly louder than usual. What a joke!<br/><br/>All in all, while Cars 2 has its flaws, what's so bad about them? Every movie has their problems, but all that matters is that the positives outweighs the negatives. As long as that happens, it's all good. I for one know I'll pick this one up on home cinema. It's a marginally passable effort, but an entertaining one at that."
"mitch_e33","7","1","3","27 June 2011"," Cars 2
","'Cars 2' (2011) picks up a few years after the original left off, with Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) winning 3 more Piston Cups since we last saw him win his first and has now been invited to participate in the new World Grand Prix. In this sequel, the attention is divided between McQueen and his tow-truck best friend Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), who is unwittingly roped himself into a top secret mission involving international spies.<br/><br/>Yes it is another Pixar sequel, and not the last from the highly regarded animation company with the follow-up to 'Monsters, Inc.' (2001), 'Monsters University' slated for a 2013 release. Is this a bad thing? Yes and no. While many commentators will argue that 'Cars 2' is the beginning of the sale of Pixar's soul, I tend to give the company a bit more credit than that. Not only have they created some of the greatest children's films of the past 20 years, but have created films that transcend the 'target' audience and leaves a lasting impact on audiences of all ages. <br/><br/>'Cars 2', it must be said however, is not their best work. In fact, it is probably one the least enjoyable experiences I have had out of a Pixar film. The important thing to note though is that this does not mean it was bad. Not at all, rather just lacking in comparison to the brilliance of 'Finding Nemo' (2003) and 'Toy Story' (1995). All in all, it was a good family film, with a particular emphasis on action. 2 long action sequences that bookend the film are brilliantly done and is some of the best high-speed work done in animation. Mater is extremely lovable, goofy character and complements the excellent voice work of Michael Caine as the international spy Finn. <br/><br/>Where I have issue with this film is the script. There are too many cheesy one-liners plucked from the last 30 years of children's action films and not enough slickness and wit that usually overflows from Pixar's scripts. There is also a lack of sentiment that accompanies the best of the companies films. 'Finding Nemo' for example, makes me, an 18 year old, cry, laugh and cry again all in the space in 90 minutes. That powerful use of emotion is not found in this film, at least not to a great degree.<br/><br/>However, that makes it seem a lot worse than it actually was. It was still a great film (certainly better than anything DreamWorks can put up), and it made my and my brother laugh numerous times."

","My older child and myself enjoyed the film, however, my 4 year old who can watch Cars 1 all day if I let him, wanted to leave and go home half way through the movie. It did not hold his attention and didn't want to continue to watch it. It did not appeal to the younger crowd in our area. Many children who were younger that we know also were not impressed. A few younger ones were crying and bored and wanted to leave also who were across from us. It seemed to be geared for a littl older audience which sort of let down the younger group who really loved the first one. It's still a good Disney film, just not what we expected and it was a let down for our younger children."

","Pixar making a bad movie was bound to happen someday, and this was it. As a stand- alone animated film, it's just an okay to mediocre kids' movie that is really stupid. As a Disney and Pixar film, it is a huge embarrassment. The main problem with this film is that the comic relief, Mater is the main character. Comic reliefs don't work as the main focus of the film, because they're not meant to carry the film. Most of the time, they just get annoying which is the case for this film. Also, the spy plot is very shallow and awkward considering the first film had nothing to do with spies, and the environmental message is very hammered in. Overall, this film is meh in the worst way possible, because it has so many glaring problems that don't get the film into bad territory.<br/><br/>Final Rating: MEH"

I mean films of love, hope, happiness, magic etc. That is what our kids want. I am really thinking of stopping all my kid channels on TV Disney, Disney XD, Cartoon network, Nick...etc. Why you ask? well because all the programs are about bombs, violence, fighting, shooting, killing...there are no longer a good moral to the stories, it is about blowing up as much as possible in the least amount of time. So why should I degrade my kids minds with this violence?<br/><br/>parents should ask themselves: what future do we want for our kids? when all science point to the fact that all this violence in films is the reason for much of the violence happening for real in the world and right outside our neighborhood. parents should ask themselves: what moral things should we learn to our children, how do we want them to become when they grow up?<br/><br/>from a father and nurse to all parents."

"Ostrumation","Null","1","4","24 October 2011"," It's an average film at best, but it's hard not to be disappointed
","Make no mistake, Pixar has arguably had a perfect track record. They have produced eleven films, all of which were critically and commercially successful. Would this studio ever make a disappointment? After outdoing themselves several times over in the last few years (""Ratatouille"", ""WALL-E"" and ""Up"" in particular), Pixar finally made a film that was below par. Another studio could get away with a film like this, but coming from Pixar, who have set the bar so high in the animated medium, it's almost unacceptable. ""Cars 2"" had a lot of potential. The brilliant opening scene should be an indicator of that. Director Brad Lewis (before John Lasseter had to come in and save the sinking ship) had a project on his hands with so many possibilities. They did one thing right, they showed us the world of ""Cars"". We saw Italy, Japan, England and France. However, ""Cars 2"" could've been a great around-the-world adventure. What holds it back from being an international thrill ride?<br/><br/>The story. Of course, Pixar is all about great storytelling. Story is king. ""Cars 2"" has a story that's so flimsy and so inconsistent, it's a real shame. ""Cars 2"" should've been about an entirely different cast of characters. It would've been risky, since the characters from the first wouldn't return, but isn't Pixar all about taking risks? The ""Cars"" world is open to so many possibilities, but yet they stick to a story about Lightning McQueen competing in an international race while Mater is mistaken for a spy. What? Unfortunately, the writing hurts what could've been an okay story. It comes off like a contrived direct-to-video storyline. McQueen and Mater are pretty much out of character in this film. The rest of the characters from the first film are decoration, along with McQueen's World Grand Prix competitors. The film is pretty much ""Mater's Spy Adventure"". Mater, Finn and Holley dominate the film. Everyone else takes a back seat to the spy story. What else hurts the story? The absence of Doc Hudson. Paul Newman passed away before production on the film began, thus the writers found it necessary to write Doc out of the film, but yet they kept Fillmore even though George Carlin passed away before production began. (There's a small tribute to Doc at the beginning, which felt contrived and tasteless) Pixar should've given the project to the DTV studio so they could do a cheap DTV sequel and start a franchise. Pixar wouldn't be involved, and thus it wouldn't stain their track record. Disney would gain, and so would Pixar. How come this route wasn't taken?<br/><br/>So the story is a mess and the product feels like a toy commercial. What does work? Fortunately, the film aims to be a mindless summer blockbuster-like film and it succeeds at that for the most part. It may not be a good film, but it's not insulting like your usual Hollywood blockbuster garbage. The action scenes are exciting, and the comic relief works for the most part. Even though Mater's antics get tiring after the while, there's still a lot of funny moments. The screenplay is shallow, but it isn't extremely bad either. The animation is dazzling, although the film goes by so fast that we don't get to savor these visuals. The story, despite its extreme flaws, has no problem getting from start to finish. That was the fastest 2 hours I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: ""Cars 2"" is definitely Pixar's first mishap. It's a run-of-the-mill action story that has great moments, but the story is so flawed and a lot of potential was wasted. It also lacks heart and sincerity, a Pixar staple. Not a terrible film, not even mediocre. But it isn't good, it's just a fun, average film. It's nothing special, which is a first coming from Pixar.<br/><br/>Grade: C"
"carvercape","3","1","4","16 October 2011"," Clichéd

"TheLittleSongbird","7","1","4","22 July 2011"," Not as strong as other Pixar films, but hardly one to bury either
","I love Pixar's films, they are beautifully animated, touching and funny with good messages and universal home truths, and they also have great music and characters. I was expecting very little from Cars 2, seeing at how much hate for it there was before and when it was released. But I went to see it anyway, as I convinced myself that even if it was disappointing there has to be at least some redeeming value to it.<br/><br/>And there was. Cars 2 initially did strike me as an unnecessary sequel, however while it is my least Pixar film I liked it actually, and to me Pixar have yet to make a film that I consider bad. Just for the record, I liked the first Cars. Before I saw this, it was my least favourite of Pixar's films, however I loved the animation, the race sequences, the music and Paul Newman. That said, I did see the first Cars recently, and it was a little better for me on re-watch especially when it came to the message.<br/><br/>Anyway about this film, there were a few things I didn't like so much. One was the plot, I admire Pixar for trying something a little more ambitious and different with the themes of espionage and all that. However, while there are a number of entertaining moments, as a whole the story didn't quite gel for me. Some have complained it was too dark, that wasn't my problem. My problem was that the story was convoluted in places, and I also had the feeling there was too much going on as well.<br/><br/>I had mixed feelings about the script. Some of it is laugh-out-loud funny, with witty and droll quips that made me smile. Conversely there are some stretches in the film that feel rather lengthy, due to the pace dragging and the scenes feeling a little too talky for my liking. Others have said about Mater too, I can understand where they're coming from. Larry the Cable Guy to me is not the problem, he puts a lot of enthusiasm into the character though he occasionally overdoes it when the dialogue is not quite as strong as it could be. I personally think Mater is stronger as a support character, he has his moments in the spotlight here, but for a lead he isn't annoying as such but somewhat bland.<br/><br/>On the other side of the argument, there are many things to like about Cars 2. The animation for starters is absolutely amazing. The colours are rich, the background art is focused and the characters move with ease. And need I mention that London and Paris for examples look absolutely beautiful? The race sequences are as exciting as can be, while the music(the first John Lasseter-directed film without a score written by Randy Newman) is energetic and very fitting and memorable. When the dialogue works, it does work and is very witty and funny.<br/><br/>The characters are still engaging. Mater while not entirely working for me has his moments, while Lightning is still interesting and amusing not to mention cocky. The female lead Holley has plenty of personality and is very strong, which is a welcome departure from female characters that have a tendency to be uninteresting or bland, and Finn McMissile is a welcome addition. I loved also the brief mention to Doc Hollywood, which was quite a touching tribute to the late great Paul Newman who voiced him.<br/><br/>The voice acting is terrific. Owen Wilson is as assured as he was before, Larry the Cable Guy is suitably enthusiastic if occasionally trying too hard and Emily Mortimer is lovely as Holley. I'd also like to mention Michael Caine who joins Paul Newman(Cars), Peter O'Toole(Ratatouille), Christopher Plummer(Up), Ned Beatty(Toy Story 3), Willem Dafoe(Finding Nemo) and Kevin Spacey(A Bug's Life) as yet another great actor to voice a Pixar character, and a fine job he does too.<br/><br/>Overall, not Pixar's best, however I don't think it is one to judge so harshly. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"teachers1319","7","1","4","27 June 2011"," Good movie but aimed to the wrong audience.
","I understand why some movie critics are saying that Cars 2 is not Pixar's best flick. However I won't say it is a bad film, because Pixar simply does not make bad films, they might make good films without the right one-two punch combination, and certainly Cars 2 is one of those films. This is not a bad movie since the superb animation effects are there and so is the astonishing attention to details, especially on the Italian and Londonese city locations, simply these blew me away, not to mention the never ending action sequences. But, and yes, there is a but, probably Cars 2 will not fit all children interest, especially the younger ones due to the violent scenes and the political and espionage intrigue suitable for young and older adults. And that is what I dislike about Cars 2. Some do not like Mater as the main character of the film, but remember, the title of both Cars and Cars 2 (in plural) dresses not one protagonist but more than one if you will. The same argument I have for the Toy Stories trilogy, in TS 1, Woody is the hero, in TS 2 Buzz Lightyear is the hero and in TS 3 every character stands out for the same cause. Pixar is and will continue to be the industry leader in CGI animation, although Dreamworks and Blue Sky have their success, still Pixar knows how to deliver fun, excitement, action, story and emotion to their flicks. In Cars 2 is was the action, excitement and technical cues that stood out, but again, not all movies are the same, you have to constantly look out in every direction possible in order to succeed."

"d_art","10","1","4","27 June 2011"," What 'Cars 2' does, it does well.
","In this sequel to Cars, race cars Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) and his tow truck pal Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) head overseas to compete in the World Grand Prix race. Mater, however, gets sidetracked with international espionage. Helped by British spy cars, Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer), Mater must stop an unknown villain trying to sabotage the race, with Lightning McQueen as his possible target.<br/><br/>I liked the first Cars, but I admit, amongst the other works of Pixar, it was my least favorite. With that said, I really enjoyed Cars 2. Yes, more so than Cars 1. It's very entertaining with both subtle and not-so-subtle humor that not everyone will quite get nor appreciate. The scenes in Tokyo are colorful and extreme. The scenes in Paris and Italy are breathtaking and beautifully rendered. This is a story about cars. There's only so many ways you can go with this subject. With that said, Pixar has again created a piece of work that remains consistent to their high quality.<br/><br/>Admittedly, Lightning McQueen, the main character in the last film played by Owen Wilson, gets less of a role here compared to Mater, played by Larry the Cable Guy. I would guess some may have a big problem with this. To be frank, Larry the Cable Guy's brand of humor isn't to everyone's taste (nor mine), and perhaps represents what makes one feel embarrassed for being Americanespecially when in a foreign country. Well, that issue is exactly what comes up in this particular film. Mater is a constant embarrassment for Lightning McQueen whenever he is around—he is ignorant, unsophisticated, and often gets himself into bad situations. What Pixar does here, however, is not to simply leave Mater to just be the butt of every joke. In fact, the characters here actually learn somethingor at least we do. The theme in this film is about friendship and seeing value in people we normally would rather not associate ourselves with.<br/><br/>The story is strong and twists are rather mind-boggling enough to keep little kids confused (but as an adult, I thought it was great!). Making Mater the main character, on a practical level, makes sense. Frankly, there are only so many more stories you can really squeeze out about Lightning McQueen at this point—everything already had been told in the last film. It's like a Rocky movie. Rocky sequels were okay, yes, but after a while, Rocky was no longer the underdog—now it's all about him keeping his title (it's like a story about a rich man staying rich)—there are not a whole lot of ways you can go with that plot (I suppose Rocky's next sequel could have him fight in spaceI know! Time machine! Brilliant!). One can say Cars 2 is like the further adventures of Rocky's Paulie, Mickey, or Adrian, from their point of view. I thought that was a good move. It's like how Empire Strikes Back was really Han Solo's film (although that is open for discussion).<br/><br/>In the previous film, I didn't care much about Mater. I learned to like him in this film. A simple character has been made a little more complex. Lightning McQueen learns a valuable lesson about friendship, and Mater learns to self-reflect. Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy are fun as always as Mater and McQueen. Michael Caine is excellent as Finn McMissile, a super agent spy car, and Emily Mortimer does fine work as Holley Shiftwell.<br/><br/>The overall feel of this film is more ""mature""-flavored without being overtly mature. This is true for much of Pixar's films in general. If you think about many classic Warner Bros. films, for example, they had many underlying mature themes. As for Pixar, they have explored, among others, themes related to mortality (Toy Story series), the family unit (The Incredibles) and fatherhood (Finding Nemo, Up). Cars do come in harm's way in this film. Some do explode. Nothing shocking here. They're cars. I dug the action scenes. This plays like a spy thriller, which admittedly, is more exciting than watching car races. Like much of Pixar's work, there is plenty of humor, a great helping of emotion, beautiful renders, and a clever story. I can't think of anything more to ask for than that. Now, did Cars really need a sequel? Perhaps not, but I enjoyed this one and it makes me even like the previous one. I'm not really into talking cars, talking bugs, or talking fishes, personally, but Pixar still manages to make me like them.<br/><br/>For more of my review updates, you can find me on twitter.com/d_art"
"StevePulaski","8","1","4","27 June 2011"," Just needs a minor tune-up
","I was really hoping that Cars 2 would score big like the first movie. The first movie is my favorite Pixar film, which maybe strange to some. It took in the lowest box office revenue out of all the films, and it is rated only a 74% on Rotten Tomatoes. Cars is true beauty in every category. Amazing colors, very heartfelt story, fifties nostalgia, amazing characters, and a soundtrack to die for.<br/><br/>Even though considered a failure in Pixar's eyes, Cars still took in over $8 billion in merchandise. Being young when the first movie came out, I went to Target and bought all of the main characters from the first movie. The little side characters or the parody Toy Story characters weren't for me. I bought the main/supporting characters like McQueen, Mater, Ramone, Flo, Guido, Luigi, Sally, Fillmore, Sarge, etc. It was so much fun to get those little cars. You gotta collect them all! They had numerous race tracks which I didn't want, pillows, t-shirts, posters, and other merchandising options that two full isles at Target were Cars-out'd the whole summer of 2006. Because cars can be made into so many different things. Race tracks, different designs, colors, sizes, etc can be made from one outline. Lightening McQueen had at least eight other versions of himself. Mater had two if I can remember if you include the very light blue painting of him and his traditional, rusty colored truck. It was inane how many options there were.<br/><br/>Now we have a sequel, to a film John Lasseter probably wanted to make since the death of his friend Joe Ranft, who helped co-direct the first film and voiced Red, the shy firetruck as well. His character makes an appearance, but remains sadly silent the whole film not uttering a single line or phrase. It's almost upsetting when you see his character.<br/><br/>Lasseter made the Toy Story sequels because they were huge money-makers and more could be done with them. I hate to say it, but I think the original Cars could've survived on its own. This is in no way bad, but it is just average to Pixar's standards. Much of the fun from the original film isn't here. The tear-jerking Your Town tune is absent, the campy Radiator Springs fun is gone, the flashbacks to the fifties where towns were made up of close friends are all gone, and the nostalgia, besides the characters, none is here.<br/><br/>Cars 2 doesn't fail entirely, though. Pixar manages to have some fun with the script and have very colorful moments about it. The end chase scene is very exciting, and I love how all the characters make it out without even a scratch. That part still impresses me. Try doing that with Grandpa's ol' 1972 Cadillac Eldorado.<br/><br/>The plot focuses on Lightening McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) returning ""home"" to Radiator Springs every summer after the racing season to visit his friends. Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) is still his tow-truck self, now working at a fancy car-themed restaurant where McQueen and his girlfriend Sally (Hunt) go to eat on McQueen's first night. Mater, who is watching TV while waiting for drinks to be served, notices that the ""sexy,"" Italian race-car Francesco Bernoulli (Turturro) is trash-talking McQueen. Mater, being the affectionate car he is, puts the motor where Bernoulli's mouth is and signs McQueen up to race against him in the Grand Prix.<br/><br/>Mater then becomes involved in a very elaborate plan conducted by Finn McMissile (Caine), a secret agent race-car. I'd rather not spoil any details because I feel reading about the colorful excitement isn't half as fun as experiencing it on the big screen.<br/><br/>Another problem I ran into that some characters didn't make an appearance, or weren't in it enough. Luigi and Guido, the two repairman of Radiator Springs, were hilarious in the first film but are in it far too little. Ramone and Flo, the husband and wife who run a body shop and diner, are barely in the film. Doc Hudson, voiced by the late Paul Newman, is dead according to Mater. And Fillmore's voice once provided by George Carlin is now voiced by Lloyd Sherr who does a just a stereotypical ""hey, man"" and ""spread the love"" motif the whole film.<br/><br/>The lights are extravagant in Cars 2, especially in Tokyo. The billboards are beautiful and the scenery is truly amazing. CGI animated features are good if used to their full potential. Glossy productions don't always win people over. For me, it needs a good storyline. Cars 2 has a fairly decent one, but not one that sustains a film.<br/><br/>The Toy Story themed short Hawaiian Vacation is actually very enticing and humorous, as all shorts from them are. I believe, this is the first Pixar short to utilize already familiar characters. Cars 2 doesn't fail at all, but it succeeds just because of its animation and well paced action. After eleven films and twenty five years of movie-making, Pixar has come to a sudden bump in the road. I'm sure this is just a minor fix, and they should be up and runnin' in a jiffy, but one can pray it doesn't go down the direction of Dreamworks or present day Disney. We may have to ship it to the junkyard.<br/><br/>Voiced by: Owen Wilson, Larry the Cable Guy, Michael Caine, Emily Mortimer, Bonnie Hunt, Jason Isaacs, and Thomas Kretschmann. Directed by: John Lasster and Brian Lewis."

Cars 2 is as good a film that belongs in the Pixar norm. I laughed, I was excited, and I cared for Mater throughout the film. All in all, it was fantastic. It reminded me of Speed Racer, Thunderbirds, and most noticeably James Bond. It was a great concept to combine all of these films and show it from the Cars' point of view. <br/><br/>Mater is charming to watch and all of the comedy read well with me.

"jasonisu4","6","1","4","25 June 2011"," What happened??
","I am a huge fan of Cars. One of my all-time favorite films. Great storyline and overall just a fun movie to watch. There is an old cliché about sequels not being as good as the original and this movie lives up to that cliché.<br/><br/>I had heard about the story involving espionage and spies and all that but I had no idea that all of this overshadows much of what the first movie was about. Racing. There are so few racing scenes in the movie and the ones that are there are unfortunately overshadowed by thugs and gangs who have a master plan to sabotage the World Grand Prix. In fact I thought that there were some scenes that were a bit much in many cases involving character death. Death in G-Rated movie!? Come on Disney! This isn't 007, its Cars! I think they got far too carried away with the whole Spy Storyline and tried to turn it into a Jason Bourne or James Bond when it should have been Cars.<br/><br/>In addition to the spy story being a bit much, there are just a few scenes that I was a bit uncomfortable with. For example at the beginning of the movie Lightning yells at Mater and basically tells him to get lost. I'm sorry but that was just terrible. In fact the whole movie revolves around Mater basically being an idiot. Again I was a bit disappointed with all of that.<br/><br/>This sequel also seems to shun some of the Radiator Springs characters. Sally, Sarge, Fillmore, Flo, Ramone, etc. might as well have not been in the movie at all. They had such few lines, I thought some scenes had been cut out of the film for time purposes. And just like the first Cars movie there are some professional racing drivers in this movie. Jeff Gordon, Lewis Hamilton, Darrell Waltrip and David Hobbs are great but again not nearly enough lines for any of them. This, I guess, goes back to the lack of racing in this film.<br/><br/>This film does provide laughs and entertainment like the original but I'm sorry as a Race Fan and as a fan of the original Cars I was deeply disappointed."

","¨-Finn McMissile, British intelligence. -Tow Mater, average intelligence¨<br/><br/>I'm glad kids don't read my reviews because they would probably disagree with everything I have to say about this film. The kids I saw the movie with in the theater had a blast and thought this was the best film they've seen. I on the other hand felt the story was really weak. When it comes to a Pixar film my expectations have grown exceedingly high, and they're to blame for that because with Toy Story 3, Up, and Ratatouille I've come to love Pixar movies for their heartfelt stories. Cars 2 on the other hand is missing that important aspect: there is no heart in this film. The story is loaded with a lot of action, it's simple, predictable, and the jokes are mostly targeted towards kids. Young audiences will be pleased, I'm OK with this as well, but I know Pixar can do much better. Cars 2 won't remain in my mind like the characters from Toy Story or Up did. It is light entertainment and many adults will be unpleased with the movie. I know other adults will be glad that their kids enjoyed the film so much so they won't have complaints about Cars, but for those of us who really enjoy these Pixar films on their own we know this movie just didn't live up to expectations. It's like the producers didn't even try and relied on the known characters to entertain the audience without worrying about writing a better story. Kids love spy movies so all they did was turn Cars into an action spy movie and voila: we got Cars 2. <br/><br/>Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has just won his fourth consecutive Piston Cup and is heading back to Radiator Springs after another successful season in racing. Doc Hudson is gone, but McQueen has dedicated yet another trophy to his mentor. Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) is the most excited about McQueen's return, and Sally (Bonnie Hunt) is also glad to be back with her hubby. McQueen is looking forward to spending some quality time with them, but Mater convinces him to enter the World Grand Prix race which is being sponsored by multi billionaire Sir Miles Axlerod (Eddie Izzard). Miles has invented a new type of green fuel and the cars will be using it for the races. McQueen's biggest competitor is Italian Formula 1 racecar, Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro), a cocky driver who drives the ladies crazy. The race however is only the subplot because once Mater arrives in Tokyo he is mistaken for a spy. Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) are British spies who are after Professor Z (Thomas Kretschmann) who seems to be trying to burn the Grand Prix by making the cars using the alternative fuel blow up. The British spies confuse Mater with an American spy and so he inadvertently becomes immersed in the action. Mater becomes the lead character in this film, and McQueen is just a supporting one.<br/><br/>John Lasseter and Brad Lewis couldn't bring back the magic in Cars 2 that they had brought to their previous films. The first film wasn't one of my favorites among Pixar movies, but it certainly is much better than this sequel. One of the major problems I had with it is that Mater took central stage and I don't think his character had what it takes to be the lead. He was always meant to be just a supporting character for other more depth characters like Lightning McQueen. The visuals are stunning as always. There are some scenes in Tokyo, London, and Italy that are just breathtaking, but the story falls way too short. Cars 2 is entertaining, but it's just missing everything that Pixar has accustomed us to. Little kids won't be disappointed; they will have fun with all the espionage and explosions, but adults looking for a heartfelt film will be leaving wanting and expecting more. The fun was targeted almost exclusively for kids and some adults may find this movie lame and predictable. Other Pixar films have made us enjoy going to the movies with our kids, but this one might make adults think twice about going with their kids to the movies and perhaps sending them with their nanny's the next time. I was disappointed with Cars 2, but only because Pixar has done way better in the past. It's not terrible, just light entertaining fun for the children. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

But Mater being the main character stunk, a little bit of Mater is good but if you add too much of him you're setting up for failure. The 2nd quarter is where it got bad, no good parts at all, Franchesco was your one of the mill show off nothing more nothing less. It felt so same old same old. Then it got even worse by the 3rd quarter. Mater, Finn, and Holly took up way too much of it with their boring side story. The only good thing was that the the race tracks were cool and unique. They tried to make up ground in the 4th quarter but it was just too late.

"ErikPedersen1","3","0","2","15 January 2018"," Pixar's Weakest Film
","The talented people at Pixar have brought us many excellent films over the years such as Toy Story, Monsters Inc, Ratatouille, Inside Out, and most recently Coco, to name a few. Unfortunately, as I watched Cars 2, I became increasingly dismayed as I realized it was the first film from Pixar that I truly disliked. Granted, I did not care much for the original Cars in 2006, but it is not a straight-up bad film. Cars 2, on the other hand, is a massive step down from its predecessor.<br/><br/>The major difference between the first and second film is that whereas the first focuses on Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), going through a decent amount of character growth before a large racing competition, the second oddly focuses on the first film's comic relief character, Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), who is caught up in a plot involving secret agents and a monocle-wearing super villain. Meanwhile, McQueen and his new racing problem is relegated to something of a backdrop.<br/><br/>The biggest issue in this film is the focus on Tow Mater, who is annoying at the best of times and insufferable at the worst. Unfortunately for me, he is in the majority of this nearly two-hour long film. Meanwhile, the story itself is dull and generic. The plot is identical to those in countless spy/action films and there is absolutely nothing new to see here. The story ends up feeling deflated and tedious as a result, which is a real shame when past Pixar films have had a great deal of creativity in their writing.<br/><br/>However, despite these criticisms, I understand that this is a film targeted for a much younger audience than myself. I am sure children who see this film will have a great deal of fun with it, but I am disappointed since Pixar films usually have some appeal for people of all ages. In Cars 2 there is sadly very little for older audiences unless you like Larry the Cable Guy.<br/><br/>I will give credit where it is due, however. Cars 2, in terms of visuals, animation, and voice-acting has a level of polish that is to be expected from a Pixar release with a production budget of $200 million. For that, I have to give the film at least some points.<br/><br/>Overall, Cars 2 would be an okay but completely unremarkable film if Larry the Cable Guy did not have such a large presence in it. As it stands though, listening to Tow Mater chattering throughout the 106 minute runtime brings my opinion of it from roughly neutral to moderately negative. It is a film I would recommend avoiding unless you loved the original Cars or want to see it for completionist's sake."

Pixar was pratically a GOD in the animation department, and have earned MORE than 20 Oscars.<br/><br/>So, why is Cars 2 a blunder? I mean, Toy Story 2 wasn't that bad really.<br/><br/>Because McQueen to be honest, doesn't really feel like the main character anymore, now it's that redneck truck, and this spy car who I haven't bothered to remember his name, because these are just boring subplots that doesn't feel like it has to be there for any reason. Hell, there's no reason this movie should exist! Why make a sequel of a ""meh"" movie? <br/><br/>Oh yeah, BECAUSE OF MERCHANDISE.<br/><br/>This is humiliating Pixar, I thought you wanted to make original movies, not make bank of a crappy film.<br/><br/>All the other side characters feel like they were pushed to the side, as McQueen and Redneck have the spotlight.<br/><br/>I can't complain about the animation though.

Mater is very annoying and not that funny, and they just don't focus enough on Mc-queen. But the trailer at least looked better than Planes (I haven't seen it, but I don't want to because it looks dumb and it gets a lot of hate.) I hope Cars 3 improves from this because if it doesn't, the franchise is dead. The story is an oil spill compared to the first because they had to ad spies.

"RainDogJr","Null","0","1","23 June 2012"," Just about the very first Pixar movie that IS NOT a great one
","""Pixar itself did a perfect example of the typical uninteresting sequel with CARS 2""; I wrote that like a week ago to make a point for my TOY STORY 3 commentary, based on what I thought it was going to be my one and only viewing of CARS 2 (that happened like a year ago, on the big screen certainly). However last Monday I joined my girlfriend and her little nephews, unexpectedly, for a DVD viewing of it. <br/><br/>So, do I still think this is an uninteresting sequel? The answer is both yes and no. Yes because the plot doesn't have the usual amount of imagination from a Pixar film; and no just because I had a nice time watching it, it was amusing and it wouldn't be fair to say it's a complete bad movie. It's just that being Pixar, and being the sequel to one of my favorite movies from them (not to mention the fact that John Lasseter himself directed it), it SHOULD have been a complete winner. <br/><br/>The main problem of CARS 2 is its hollow story; we all know that Pixar knows how to deliver great stuff from a very basic idea, but this time that basic idea is, to begin with, not very good: it's the kind of classic going-in-a-world-tour material, with Lightning McQueen going to Japan, Italy and England for some car racing tour. While I haven't seen the actual film (THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT) I do have seen three movies of that franchise and I recall thinking while watching the trailer for ""Tokyo Drift"" that they were just going to do the same thing but now in Tokyo (being that Tokyo element the main attraction). Here the problem is that nothing is quite exciting once we begin to go with our main characters to those countries; it looks great, to be fair, but for instance Lighting McQueen's participation is reduced to basically nothing memorable thanks to this repetitive thing. <br/><br/>The main change of CARS 2 is that now Mater is the main character. It's his film basically and he becomes the protagonist of the part of this sequel that has a James Bond element, with spy cars, British intelligence, Mater being confused as an American spy car and stuff. It's funny material, I must say, and clearly the reason why I said that I had a good time watching it. Hell, I can't deny that I was way more interested in it than the kids I was with! Anyway, CARS 2 is pretty much, and sadly, the very first Pixar movie that IS NOT great. <br/><br/>*Watched it (again) on 18 June, 2012"

They don't make the movies thinking about what kids would like to see, as they have often stated. They make movies they love to watch themselves. And while Cars (the first movie) might have been the ""worst"" movie Pixar has done so far, it was still way above some other animated movies from other studios.<br/><br/>Still as much as I love Cars 2 (and giving Mater an arc), this probably will be the year remembered, when Pixar didn't win the animated Oscar! But back to Mater: He might not be everyones cup of tea and he has an accent that some might not like from the get-go. But the car is funny.

But I actually thought Cars 2 was more violent and I was pretty surprised at the death toll. In fact, I'd have given it a PG rating as well. But while Cars didn't make me laugh at all, Cars 2 made me laugh a few times. Mater definitely held the movie together while McQueen who, in my opinion, is the more boring character is just supporting.<br/><br/>Actually, I guess what I'm saying is that if you didn't like Cars, you'll probably like Cars 2.

","Cars no. 2? Not great. Pixar has been able to top itself time after time but this is a little step backward.<br/><br/>Not that it doesn't entertain and the animation, while not sensational is crisp. The main problems are the characters and the story. Having an accidental spy plot is always dangerous ground. Many have tried and failed (The Man Who Knew Too Little or The Man With One Red Shoe), dismal failures in the careers of Bill Murray and Tom Hanks respectively. Those plots are basically repeated here and only slightly improved.<br/><br/>The gags are also extremely weak. Lightning McQueen is made a supporting character while Mater takes the lead. Because of that, slight alterations are made to his character but they are alas not that interesting. A mortal sin is having Michael Caine in a totally straight part which doesn't even have a hint of self-referential acknowledgment.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, the story is simply not compelling and there are too many stereotypical characters. To make them into talking cars doesn't make them less of a cliché.<br/><br/>Don't take what is written deter you from watching it, though.

Although the animation was quite good and there were some fun references to race car legends, James Bond movies, and human relationships, within a few minutes of the start of the movie I began to sense that the Pixar magic was nowhere be found. The plot was unlikely and only a few of the beloved cast of the original movie were utilized to any significant extent. Too often the crutch of the chase scene was utilized, to hide the lack of the depth of character development I've come to expect from the legends of Emeryville. As if this weren't disappointing enough, the story also had a predictable uber-villain Nazi-big-oil caricature complete with monocle. And finally at the end we're treated to the tiresome Hollywood message that being loyal to a friend is more important than logic or safety concerns. <br/><br/>In the Pixar Story we learn that Lassiter stepped in on two earlier occasions to completely rework two previous movies and save the day.

""Cars 2"" aims to correct the previous mistake of a thin plot and a dubious central premise.<br/><br/>The computer animated film starts well enough, with a well paced and exciting Bond pastiche, following a British Aston Martin secret agent Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) infiltrating and escaping from a villains lair, aboard multiple offshore oil platforms.<br/><br/>We then return to Radiator Springs, home of Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) and his BCF (Best Car Friend) Mater, the rusty pick up truck (Larry The Cable Guy). McQueen has become a successful racer, winning the piston cup, now renamed the Hudson trophy (in honour of the late Paul Newman's character in the previous film) but is taking some downtime in his home time with his Porsche girlfriend Sally (Hunt).<br/><br/>Mater is acting in a manner that would get him slapped with a restraining order in real life but in cartoon land, just wants to spend more time with his best pal. Responding to a TV phone in boast, Mater enters McQueen in the ""World Grand Prix"", a race organized by Sir Alexelrod (Izzard) to promote his new alternative fuel ""Allinol"".<br/><br/>This provides an excellent excuse to travel the globe, Italy, Japan and England for races between McQueen and his arch rival, the Italian Formula1 car, Bernoulli (Tuturro). F1 is never mentioned, perhaps due to contractual reasons, Bernie Ecclestone presumably not buying into the whole talking cars approach.<br/><br/>The whole local support team are brought back onto the pit crew to assist McQueen on his quest and somewhat reluctantly, Mater is allowed along for the ride.<br/><br/>Mater quickly messes everything up and inadvertently gets mixed up in International espionage with Finn and Holly Shiftwell (Mortimer), as they attempt to uncover a dastardly plot headed by Professor Zendepp (Kretschsmann). The professor, rather bizarrely, is in charge of an army or fleet of ""Lemons"", cars that were inherently a bit rubbish. Cue the first torture scene in a Pixar film, admittedly off screen, as information is extracted from the unfortunate Rod Torque Redline.<br/><br/>Various adventures and action sequences follow, crude stereotypes are employed, the Queen in England, Mafia types in Italy, does the main villain really have to be a German with a monocle, really, on a car? The film ends with a lengthy explanation of who did what and why, emulating the end of a ""Scooby Doo"" episode. This has never been necessary in a Pixar film before, normally what/why is covered subtly within the film, lengthy exposition has never been necessary, see the start of ""Up"" for how much can be conveyed in a short time.<br/><br/>As ever, the animation and sound are faultless, the race scenes are more exciting than a F1 race, sound and picture in perfect harmony and the set pieces are fun, exciting and imaginative.<br/><br/>With bright colours and talking cars, younger children will enjoy the film, just as they did the original ""Cars"".<br/><br/>Adults however, may be very disappointed. Not a word usually used in the same sentence as ""Pixar"". The idea that cars can talk with their mouths animated and wheels acting as hands, in many ways just does not work. Arguably, too many liberties have to be taken to provide the cars with human characteristics and then you wonder, what's the point? There are many segments in the film where the story is just, well, boring and yet this is normally a Pixar strong point. Eddie Izzard is a flamboyant comedian and yet here, is allowed to just read his lines with hardly any inflection, something he would likely have resisted given the opportunity.<br/><br/>Wilson is bland, Mortimer a bit more lively but the voice cast is only really saved by a sterling performance by Caine, audiences will recognize his voice anywhere.<br/><br/>Directed by the vastly experienced John Lasseter the head honcho at Pixar, this appears to be more an exercise in getting as many characters on screen, in as many different territories as possible to sell as many toys as possible. Whilst this may have been the net result of other Pixar films, you never felt it was their sole intention. Here it does feel like an extended Toy commercial in parts, sell the toys and wrap a film around that premise, rather than a great film that happened to spawn a line of toys.<br/><br/>Lets hope this is not Disney's pervading marketing influence affecting the company, as the partnership evolves. Certainly we expect better when ""Brave"", the new Pixar film hits our screens next year <br/><br/>Summary<br/><br/>Fun for young kids but audiences who have left Primary school behind, may find little to interest them here, despite the excellent animation and action.<br/><br/>Better than the original but inherits many of it's flaws and represents a further minor disappointment from a studio that has always promised and delivered so much more.<br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/"

","The Pixar library stands as modern animation's most impressive by far, partly due to both the studio and Disney's belief that sequels should only be made with the right artistic reasons in mind, namely a good story. That's why, to date, we have just ""Toy Story 2,"" ""Toy Story 3"" and ... ""Cars 2"" ... ? <br/><br/>The original ""Cars"" has largely been considered the worst of the Pixar movies, in the same way that Pluto might be considered the worst of the nine planets. So why create a sequel? The answer that's hard to hear is that ""Cars"" has done incredible merchandising business compared to the other Pixar films. The less cynical answer would be that its director, Pixar head honcho and young boy at heart John Lasseter, loves the ""Cars"" universe — a lot. ""Cars 2"" plays out as a fantasy for a 6 to 10-year-old boy, one that cares much more about sheen than story, despite Pixar consistently championing that phrase the other way around.<br/><br/>In fairness, ""Cars 2"" does everything a sequel should in terms of widening the scope, upping the action and improving the overall visuals. Pixar set the bar for technical mastery in digital animation and every animator and member of the production team meets that standard if not exceeds it. It's the story under the hood that struggles, choosing fun as its main objective as opposed to heart.<br/><br/>And ""Cars 2"" has fun by the tankful. Lasseter, Brad Lewis and Dan Fogelman's story takes the ""Cars"" universe and throws ""James Bond"" into it, a cocktail most definitely shaken and not stirred. The film introduces British secret agent cars Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holly Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) who are trying to find out what the dastardly Professor Z (Thomas Kretschmann) is up to at the World Grand Prix, a new race sponsored by Sir Miles Axelrod (Eddie Izzard), an adventurer who is now promoting his new alternative fuel source.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Lightning McQueen has been busy racing and winning championships when he finally returns to his old pal Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) in Radiator Springs. It's a short vacation, however, as Formula 1 race car Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro) has challenged McQueen to the World Grand Prix. He accepts and brings Mater to Tokyo with him, where our secret agents believe Mater to be an American spy helping them out.<br/><br/>Most surprisingly, Lightning McQueen takes a back seat in to Mater in this film. Agreed that Mater is one of the funnier supporting characters that Pixar has written and in this film he's equally if not more hilarious, but McQueen's quest to be the best is completely inconsequential. There's a moment, as is in just about every film where the message is about friendship, when he spurns Mater and then later tries to make amends, but it happens so early on. Any emotional impact the film could have had is zapped thanks to this and the fact that McQueen has no bearing on the spy plot.<br/><br/>The real problem with the story of ""Cars 2"" can ultimately be attributed to the fact that it does not necessitate being told in a world where the characters are all cars and other vehicles. The same story could have been told with human characters and nothing would have changed. The car aspect serves only as the chance to be clever with a number of car-related jokes and gadgetry. <br/><br/>Disappointment will resonate with a lot of Pixar fans, yet the truth is ""Cars 2"" is such a well- oiled machine that it's much easier to discuss what the film lacked than its strengths. The action, the wit, the cleverness and the impeccable visuals we've come to expect from Pixar make it a first-rate animated film. However, we've also come to expect an emotional pull, the feeling of being on the verge of tears for even just a bit. ""Cars 2"" doesn't deliver that at all, nor the feeling of artistic purpose. It feels like a studio making the best movie it could with the pieces it already had in place from its financial successful 2006 film.<br/><br/>At the same time, if ""Cars 2"" brings in enough money that it funds another three years of powerful, intelligent and emotional original films like ""Up,"" ""Toy Story 3"" and ""WALL*E,"" I can deal with that.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site! moviemusereviews.com"

This was unexpected, and I love the feeling watching this movie. It's like watching The Incredibles, only with a different story line.<br/><br/>I think Cars 2 is a bit underrated. I found it exciting and worth watching! And also, the animation is stunning (like always from PIXAR), the images of the cities made me want to travel around the world so badly!<br/><br/>Overall, if you enjoy watching The Incredibles, I think you will like this one, too.

"Buick_Regal_Racecar_56","9","0","2","17 October 2011"," Once A Fan, Always A Fan
","I admit, right at the beginning of this review, I am biased towards the Cars franchise. Since the very first one in 2006 (which, I swear to you, I believed to be Pixar's downfall itself before I even saw the movie) I have been a fan of Cars. Never was my favorite the cocky, arrogant rookie main character, never was it the bumbling sidekick Mater, it was the unloved, bad guy character Chick Hicks. Who, in all truth, was likely ten times as arrogant as McQueen himself.<br/><br/>Now, I must make a confession- I saw Cars 2 in theaters three times, anticipating that the film would destroy all my hopes and dreams- yes, even I, a Cars fan who wrote fanfiction based on the original film, mocked Pixar's decision to make a sequel to their 'most hated' movie. Yet, the moment the Toy Story short began, I realized all my anticipations that the movie would be a flop were wrong. <br/><br/>This movie has a blend of super spy action and Pixar's own unique brilliance. I think most people miss out on the true heart of this one- the moral of the story is realized with Mater. Everyone views him as just the stupid tow truck- McQueen even tells him to act unlike himself. Yet in the end, the moral is to just be yourself. <br/><br/>Yes, this movie is chock full of the character that some people have compared as the Jar Jar of the Cars franchise. Yes, it is a super spy movie that has some very questionable jokes and actual on-screen deaths. Yes, it wasn't a sequel to The Incredibles (which, to me, was honestly just another superhero movie) or Ratatouille (ugh, cooking). But, it was a sequel to Cars. And I can honestly say this- it's what I wanted it to be. In all honesty, Cars 2 was a Pixar great in its own way.<br/><br/>For one, for a fanfiction writer like myself, it answered questions that needed to be answered. Like guns and planes and the like. It was a more in depth view to a world that before had only been a single town and two racetracks. It was like a look into another world, another dimension, where yes, humans don't exist. In all the other Pixar movies, there are humans. So why is it the one that doesn't have humans suddenly has the most opposition?<br/><br/>Secondly, Cars 2 has exactly what it needed to have. John Lasseter made this and Cars because he got an idea. Haven't you ever just had an idea and wanted to go with it? He did, and it became a movie that has characters which have become plastered to little kids T-shirts. People recognize the characters, and even if these kids don't have the in depth experience that I do having grown up with Pixar (literally, Toy Story came out 2 years after I was born, and I've seen every single Pixar movie) they know the characters.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the music is amazing. Most pointedly, the song in the credits, sung by a popular country singer in the US and a popular singer in the UK. It's a song that really personifies a personal connection I have with this movie- I have a best friend in England. I saw this movie in England with her- all three times. It was, in a way, very touching to see the details of London in an animated movie having only been there a few days before. It was touching seeing a movie about being yourself with the very friend who helped me through middle school, a time where I had to be someone else to fit in; a problem she also had. Cars 2 inspired me, and it touched me. <br/><br/>I know there are people out there who hate this movie. I know there are people who believe Pixar failed the world with this one. I'm sorry that I'm an actual fan of both movies. But Pixar has always been my inspiration. They dream of worlds no one else would believe, worlds no one else could possibly think up. They take an idea and make it grow into something unique, something valuable. Something that is worth watching. <br/><br/>Toy Story 3 had a personal connection for me- I was going off to college soon when I saw that movie. The moment I got home from that movie, I went to my toy box in my room to see if I still had the Woody doll I've had since as long as I can remember. I cried at that movie. Cars 2 didn't have that same amount of connection for me. Yet, it did because of it's message. In a world where everyone feels the need to conform, just be yourself.<br/><br/>Now the only thing to worry about with Pixar is their prequel to Monsters Inc. <br/><br/>Although, trust me- I loved the first. You'll probably see a review for that one in 2013 :)"
"tyreeewebster","3","0","1","15 October 2011"," Retrospective Reviews- Cars 2 (2011)
","Okay, here we go. We all know that out of ALL of the Pixar movies, 'Cars' wasn't the one screaming for a sequel. But if the dudes at Pixar REALLY believed this movie should have been done, they would have gone on with it and made a great movie that was as fun as their previous movies. And I'm glad they made it.<br/><br/>PROS: I guess the best part of the film is that I didn't have high expectations for this movie to be the studios best, in fact, 'Toy Story 3' was their best but we all know they can't EVER make a movie that's as good as that. Once I saw the film, it wasn't too bad. It was funny, exciting, and had a good charm, feel and message, just be who you are, no matter what anybody else says. The animation was as good as ever, Pixar once again shows us why they're the animation kings. The look of the film was spectacular, with London, Tokyo, Italy and France looking brilliant. The atmosphere of all the locations drag you in so you feel like these are places you've been to before! (I've only been to London, but it's still great). The action sequences were extraordinary, my brother LOVES action films, and even though he had huge doubts about this film, I knew he'd watch it anyway because of all the explosions, guns and bombs and whatnot, with the new direction the franchise was taken in, it felt like a stand- alone movie, and not just a rehash of the characters and plot elements from the first one. Another good thing is that the film, unlike other Pixar films, doesn't take itself too seriously. Think about it, it's about SPY CARS! You wouldn't expect lots of teary- eyed feelings scenes like the original 'Cars' or the 'Toy Story' films! It's just a movie that you can switch your brain off to and watch. It's a popcorn movie.<br/><br/>CONS: One of the few negative aspects of the film is the script, the story was a bit rusty and could have used a bit of Allinoil! Get it? Anyway, they could have tweaked the script a little bit, but the film still holds up. Lightning McQueen could have been used a lot more, we didn't really see many scenes of him and Mater together, so we couldn't really see how their friendship developed or how it deteriorated. But, other than those 2 things. The movie was another hit from Pixar. After 11 films of heart- warming stuff from them, it's about time the studio got rid of some of that touchy- feely stuff and just have some fun! And that's exactly what they've done here! Besides, all the critics and people who bashed this movie would have NEVER been able to put as much heart, soul and hard working story- telling into a film THEY make. This isn't a film for critics, OR a film for car lovers, it's for the people who don't like cars that much and LOVE movies. This is why, to me, it's more enjoyable that the first film.

","Since the release of the first fully computer animated feature film Toy Story (1995), Pixar Animation Studios have enjoyed a string of successes with their films. Critics adore them, adults and children are stunned by them. But 2006′s Cars was the first movie to split opinions. It was certainly the weakest Pixar entry. Five years later, the public has been invited back into the driving seat for the sequel which again has divided the masses.<br/><br/>Cars 2 is not vintage Pixar, it lacks the intimacy of Up (2009), the intrigue of Wall.E (2008) and the nostalgic joy of the Toy Story franchise (1995 – 2010). It is not a perfect film by any sense of the word and joins its predecessor in the weaker section of the studio's filmography. However, Cars 2 is still thrilling and visually extravagant, surpassing the majority of its animated rivals.<br/><br/>After being challenged by Italian Formula 1 car Francesco Bernoulli (voiced by John Turturro), Piston Cup winner Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) teams up with 'Tow' Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) and heads off to the World Grand Prix: the ultimate race that takes place in Japan, Italy and London. However, behind the scenes is a spy ring headed by British secret agent Finn McMissile (voiced by Sir Michael Caine) and his new partner Holley Shiftwell (voiced by Emily Mortimer). Some confusion later leads to Mater being mistaken for a spy and he has to join forces with McMissile to stop a deadly threat to the car world.<br/><br/>The main problem with Pixar's sequel is that it seems to slightly forget what the studio preaches oh–so–often. Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter is famous for believing that computer animation is only a tool to make these movies; characters and narrative drive the picture. But the characterisation in this movie is sadly below par. The majority of Radiator Springs' natives are completely forgotten and bizarrely, Mater has the majority of the screen time, making him the lead and McQueen the supporting act.<br/><br/>It is certainly not all bad. The last few DreamWorks entries have gone toe-to-toe with the Luxo Lamps, but Cars 2 makes sure they lead the pack once again. The visuals are phenomenal, particularly in the race sequences: the Tokyo footage is beautiful with its glowing neons soaking the night's sky and the impressive reflections on the racers' bodywork.<br/><br/>Then, there's the action: the film's opening is literally explosive, the espionage storyline brings insanely cool gadgets bursting to life in all the mania while the chase sequences look and feel fast-paced. One particular chase through the tightly-wound Italian streets is certainly amongst the film's high points.<br/><br/>The voicing is universally very good. Wilson is great as McQueen and does exactly what he does in the first picture, he's just not as cocky. Caine is great as McMissile and is easily the best character in the film: his gadgets are cool, his action scenes are cool and he, himself, is undeniably cool. Mortimer is also a strong casting choice as Shiftwell as is Turturro as the cheesy and over-confident Francesco.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a family film to see now the children have finished school, Cars 2 is a great choice and offers plenty for all to enjoy. If you are expecting another Toy Story 3 or an inner-child exercise, you might be a little disappointed.<br/><br/>Verdict: ●●● Although 'Cars 2′ doesn't offer the sheer wonder of other Pixar features, it's still a very solid, entertaining and visually impeccable feature that's well worth your time.<br/><br/>Read more reviews on www.theupcoming.co.uk"

"Big Jimmy","7","0","1","7 August 2011"," Still better than most everything else out there
","I have to say that after the previous years of Pixar entertainment, ""Cars 2"" was probably the most shallow of any of them, yet had probably the most complex plot (as any good spy flick should). I'm surprised to see the low ratings for this compared to a lot of the other over-rated dreck out there. For example, ""Rio"" looks spectacular, but the plot is borrowed from several other Disney movies and the writing is right on par with George Lucas or James Cameron. ""Cars 2"" is as beautiful if not more so than ""Rio"" and the writing is considerably more solid. Is it Pixar's best? Nope. It's probably Pixar's worst. But that's like saying a diamond has a few flaws in it: it's still more valuable than most of the other gems out there. Pixar has raised the bar so high that anything shy of another world record is a dismal failure. Why can't Pixar have a little fun for once without having to have a deeper story?"
"fionaharnett","Null","0","1","3 August 2011"," It was Inevitable.. The first poor Pixar movie...
","Pixar has never succumbed to cash-in sequels; sure, we had both Toy Storys' 1 + 2, but there was another chapter to their story that had to be told. However, I always doubted a sequel to Cars could improve on its predecessor as it had reached a natural conclusion- I rated Cars higher than other reviewers as I liked its fish-out-of-water, homely Pixar-like feel. It didn't need a sequel..<br/><br/>And it certainly didn't deserve this.<br/><br/>Cars 2 bears no resemblance to its 1st chapter and you get the feeling that John Lasseter, director, was just let loose, no one stepping in his way to put his pet project on the right tracks.<br/><br/>Other reviewers explain its Bond-like premise, a global travel movie following Maters exploits as an 'accidental' spy. And everyones favourite Lightning McQueen? He's sidelined, almost a cameo appearance from Owen Wilson. Which begs the question- why did he bother? Larry the Cable Guys' Mater was the comic relief in the first film but is now promoted to lead, stretching every audience member to the limit with his corny and mind-numbing jokes.<br/><br/>The story is hard to follow, especially for its supposed target audience, and its excessive use of violence makes me question its 'U' rating. It starts off well enough with a prologue featuring the ever-watchable Michael Caine. But as soon as we arrive in the familiar surroundings of Radiator Springs, everything takes a turn for the worse..<br/><br/>Oh why, Pixar....."

","‎'Cars 2' was alright. An okay sequel to probably one of the weakest Pixar films. If you're not a fan of Larry the Cable Guy's ""Mater"", then you won't enjoy it. It's basically his film, not Lightning McQueen's. Also missed the voices of the late Paul Newman and George Carlin this time around. A good film, but strictly for the little ones (went with a free ticket, btw).<br/><br/>The one thing I was very impressed with, from an animation standpoint, was the incredibly realistic outdoor daytime shots. From the picturesque desert skies of Radiator Springs to the overcast skies of London, I found myself doing a double-take at how realistic it all looked, right down to the buildings and cobblestone roads in the foreground. Very well done."

","Great sequel to a great movie! Cars 2 might have been trashed by the critics and most people, but this movie does not deserve that treatment. <br/><br/>It is an action packed fast paced entertainer, about Mater- Lightning's best friend- going to Tokyo to see his friend race, and getting mixed up in a spy action, and how this affects Lightning's all important race. Why are there problems in the race? What does Mater do with the spies?, are the questions which will be answered if you watch the film. <br/><br/>The movie moves at a jet's speed from scene 1 to the last scene. It is guaranteed that there will be no scenes which will bore you. The idea of mixing up spies, cars and racing in one movie is appreciable, and I thought it has been done intelligently with logic. <br/><br/>The movie's biggest plus however is the extraordinary visuals and details put into each scenes, which of course is the thing Pixar is famous for. The animation has been spot on. <br/><br/>I agree that it does not go much into the character's feelings which people would have expected from Pixar, but I don't think Pixar meant to make this movie emotional but full of action and entertainment, and in that point of view, Pixar has succeeded in that. But there are some emotional scenes about friendship too (but only few for those seeking emotion in Pixar film) <br/><br/>There are however some issues as the spy theme seems to be a bit complicated to younger audience, which is where the bad reviews come from. <br/><br/>But overall it is a great movie for the summer, but by far better than Cars 1!!!

","When I saw the trailers for Cars 2, I expected the movie to be average, something I could sit through and not fall asleep. A movie that I could go to with my siblings and not be bored to death. I was extremely wrong. The plot was full of twists and turns, unexpected action. I was laughing at Mater's 'pistachio ice cream' incident. It brought smiles to everyone's faces and was an unexpectedly great comedy, action and hidden romance. From the James Bond style characters to our fellow friends from Radiator Springs, it was a humorous movie that I will never forget. Its something someone would want to watch over and over again and never tire from it. This is a movie for the young and old, something a child will cherish and an adult can be nostalgic with. Pixar brings out things that would normally be in an adult film, and turns them into something a young 8 year old could easily understand. So move aside Disney and say hello to the new boss, Pixar."
"lesleyharris30","9","0","2","25 July 2011"," A Good, Fresh Sequel,
","Cars 2 is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and a fantastic voice cast. It's a very fresh sequel to Cars, completely different. I loved the spy movie theme, it was a very clever device to use in this universe and putting Mater at the centre of this adventure was the right choice. The universe expands itself far beyond what we see in the first film, and it is truly gorgeous to watch. <br/><br/>It definitely has issues, it is missing heart, something that is very evident in the first Cars. It is there at times, but not nearly as powerful or heartwarming, it went for a comedic effect, which is fine, but for a Pixar movie I felt like it should have been much more sweet. As well as that, I think every character other than Mater is underused, McQueen is not in it nearly enough for the fact that he's suppose to be the main character of this series, and I definitely think Finn McMissile, superbly voiced by Michael Caine, could have had a much more prominent role, he is easily one of the best characters to come out of this franchise.<br/><br/>The film expands the Cars universe immensely, which I think is the highlight, the first one really only takes place in two locations, but here we get to see them go all around the world. We see the Cars equivalent of Tokyo, France, England, it is all very impressive and the animators certainly did not hold back, it looks very beautiful. <br/><br/>Simple family fun. It may be missing the heart that made the first Cars so great, but Cars 2 is a fun ride and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film. <br/><br/>Lightning McQuenn takes on the World Grand Prix along with his pit crew and his best pal Mater, who is mistaken for a spy and gets caught up in his own adventure."
"Likes_Ninjas90","8","0","3","24 July 2011"," Cars 2 is vintage Pixar: a rousing adventure, overflowing with humour, colour and personality
","A super spy car named Finn McMissile (voiced by Michael Caine), who belongs to British intelligence, sneaks onto an oil derrick to photograph an extraordinary new weapon that's being developed by the evil Professor Z (Thomas Kretschmann). Meanwhile, back in the town of Radiator Springs, Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is looking to find some space for himself and his girlfriend Sally, away from his best friend Mater (Larry the Cable Guy). But after Mater confronts a rival of McQueen's over the phone, an arrogant racing car called Francesco (John Turturro), McQueen is invited to the World Grand Prix race, organised by Sir Miles Axlerod (Eddie Izzard). His race is being held in four countries, Japan, France, Italy and Britain and he's promoting it through alternative energy by having some of the cars run on electric power instead of regular oil. At a promotional party in Tokyo, Mater is mistaken for an American spy by McMissile and his impulsive assistance Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer). They enlist him on a mission to stop the super weapon from being aimed at cars on the racetrack. <br/><br/>Cars 2 is vintage Pixar: a rousing adventure, overflowing with humour, colour and personality. Most sequels look to recycle what was previously successful. Here, the clever screenplay by Ben Queen has changed the direction of Cars entirely. The first film centred on the reinvigoration of a small, desert community, as McQueen did some soul-searching. But despite retaining some of the same important moral lessons, Cars 2 is more on par with a spy movie and has given Mater the centre stage this time. The opening chase scenes work to parody the James Bond films by including a mysterious villain, high tech gadgets and a devious scheme on a global scale. But most pleasing is how effective the writers have worked the classic line of 'mistaken identity' into the story and the film's composition too. Cars 2 reveals itself to be a tribute to any number of Hitchcock films, complete with a MacGuffin-like device as well. There's an exhilarating racing scene in Toyko where directors John Lasseter and Brad Lewis handle this with aplomb. Using cross-cutting, they bring three or four different threads together at once, so effortlessly, that the film bursts with humour and dramatic irony. Adding to the fun is when the film plays with other chase movie clichés, including old favourites like the red digital readout bomb, all moving at a rapid pace. And as expected, the animation is flawless. Each city looks and feels unique, in part because of the colour and the miniscule level of detail. Look for sight gags like the monocle on Professor Z, the bobby hats on the British police cars, a glimpse of the Popemobile or even just the expressive brow of Mater himself. It's stunning how often Pixar draws emotion from once inanimate objects. They're aided immeasurably by some excellent voice actors, who bring feeling to their characters. And if this wasn't enough incentive, there's a very funny short film before the main picture, featuring the cast of Toy Story. Ka- chow!"
"FilmFanatic03","6","0","1","23 July 2011"," Not as good as the first, but still an enjoyable PIXAR animation
","First to say that it was not as good as the first film but that aside you will still enjoy this film, it's PIXAR, no matter what they do it will still have some substance. Starting off with the positives, I loved the whole cultural and spy genre addition to the film. The film focuses on Mater and it's more of a self discovery of his character than about Lightning McQueen which was quite cool. They travel a lot in this film and you see Japan, Italy and England which was really good, and it felt so real because of the brilliant animation. The new characters voiced by Michael Caine and Emily Mortimer as spies were a great addition to the film. However, I hate to criticise a PIXAR film but for a sequel it felt a bit relaxed, in a way of thinking ""Cars was great, we don't really need to develop anymore"" until the whole spy plot kicks in but it should have thrown itself into the new plot instead of lingering from what made the first one great. Just like how ""Toy Story 2"" felt like a great sequel. But you will still enjoy this film for the great action and how cannot you not resist a PIXAR animation, they know how to make an animation."

"splodgeroonie","6","0","1","18 July 2011"," Proof of the old adage that money destroys art
","It was only a matter of time before the money changers took up residence in the temple. As pioneers of a new art form (the CG feature length) Pixar had a good run but this is definitely their fall from grace.<br/><br/>There really was no reason for a Toy Story III in my mind although many would beg to differ. Almost everyone agrees though that Cars II was completely unnecessary and nothing more than the type of money grab Disney has become infamous for.<br/><br/>It was bound to happen of course. Disney itself was one of the great pioneers of a new art form in the early years of the twentieth century (animation itself) but any new medium will always suffer once it becomes profitable and industrialized. I've been a fan of Pixar since day one however so, although I knew this was inevitable, seeing this in the theatre tonight was bit of a sad moment for me.<br/><br/>As a humour and action packed eye-candy diversion it's still up there amongst the best of course, which is why I'll give it something and say I don't feel like I wasted the price of my ticket, but as a Pixar feature it was a major letdown. This was only enhanced by the reuse of the Toy Story universe for the ""opening cartoon"". (Day & Night was the last piece or inspired animation to come out of the studio in this viewer's opinion.)<br/><br/>The Brave trailer did look promising though so here's hoping the studio will continue to release some story driven gems in between the profit driven product releases."
"Herbys","Null","0","1","16 July 2011"," Not up to par
","Cars 2 isn't a bad movie, but it was clearly more designed to sell toys than to be enjoyed at the theatre. The story was completely uninspired and at times too complex for kids. It was a tad too violent for my taste but not to the point to scare a kid or hurt the kids psyche in any way, but I get the feeling that all the explosions were there just to keep interest as the story itself wasn't enough. But what bothered me the most was the ending. Or lack thereof. From Toy Story all Pixar movies have memorable endings. Some almost make me cry every time I see them (""I wasn't aiming for the truck"" in Toy Story 1, saved by the claw in Toy Story 3, Mc Queen sacrificing his Piston Cup for an ailing King). Cars 2 simply didn't have a memorable ending by any standard. It just happened, and I'm sure in a few weeks I won't even remember what it was. A completely forgettable movie, and I think that's a definitive first for Pixar. What a shame."
"Reel_starz","6","0","1","14 July 2011"," An enjoyable, if uneven, ride
","It seems cliché nowadays to critique Pixar's work by comparing it to their previous resume, but at a certain point, it is unavoidable. After two decades of churning out successful, critically acclaimed films, Pixar's name has become synonymous with quality animation, making them almost indisputably the most trustworthy studio in Hollywood. However, such a lofty reputation elicits even loftier standards. Considering the fact that general consensus has established that Cars is Pixar's worst film (meaning it is only very good instead of spectacular), it is no surprise that the release of that movie's sequel was met with comparatively low expectations. I'll be the first to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed the first Cars and find its status undeserved (both Monsters, Inc. and A Bug's Life are mediocre, in my humble opinion), so I prayed that Cars 2 would surprise everyone by continuing Pixar's streak – and besides, at least at the time, a spy movie with cars seemed kind of genius. Did they deliver on this promise? Not quite. What I got was a jumbled yet consistently entertaining combination between a winking homage to old-timey espionage thrillers and a kid-friendly tale about animated cars. And hey: if nothing else, it looked stunning.<br/><br/>I'll start with what worked. Of course, the visuals were absolutely gorgeous, even for Pixar. The various landscapes (our protagonists jumped all across the globe, stopping by Tokyo, Paris, Italy and London, among other exotic locales) leapt off the screen, alive with color and detail, making the action scenes especially vivid, and I'll never cease to be amazed by Pixar's ability to give inanimate objects such as cars and toys seemingly genuine emotion. I might even venture to say that Cars 2 is Pixar's most aesthetically impressive project to date, except for, perhaps, Wall-E. Also as expected, the voice talent is impeccable. The entire main cast from the first Cars is present, excluding, of course, the late Paul Newman, and as before they all blend nicely into their characters, but of the newcomers, Michael Caine (appropriately suave as the British spy car, Finn McMissile) is the standout. While not quite as noteworthy, Emily Mortimer, Eddie Izzard and John Turturro provide adequate support. Both of these elements combined with frequently sharp dialogue to lend unexpected verve to the proceedings. There is not a dull moment throughout, and as a fan of genre movies, I particularly appreciated the homage to classic spy films, which was not only clever and audacious but also, for the most part, well-executed.<br/><br/>The part that didn't work so well, however, was the sequel. After the Toy Story sequels, Pixar proved that they are fully capable of successfully giving new depth to old plot lines and characters, but the lighthearted story about friendship established by Cars does not mesh well with the more sleek, high-octane concept of Cars 2, resulting in a movie that feels erratic and confused. The leap from Radiator Springs to Europe and Asia is jarring, and the genre-blending at which Pixar usually excels instead comes off as clumsy, much as it did in Wall-E (which many critics adored but I found well-intentioned and visually breathtaking yet ultimately flawed). Much of the problem lies with the ill-advised decision to take Owen Wilson's Lightning McQueen out of the spotlight and replace him with Larry the Cable Guy's Mater. In the first Cars, Mater provided a likable, energetic counterpart to the more self-serious Lightning McQueen, but as the central character, he is uninteresting and even, at times, irritating; the audience sympathizes with him but doesn't really root for him. As a result, despite some attempts at a rather muddled and erroneous message about staying true to yourself (apparently regardless of standard rules of courtesy), Cars 2 lacks what makes most Pixar movies stand out: heart. You never get the sense that Mater – or any of the characters, for that matter – is going to change by the end, so, really, what's the point?"

","Cars 2 looks amazing. The sets are just breathtaking, with views from Japan, Italy and England. The animators had fun adding little details that mirror the world of Cars in real places of the world; for example, instead of Big Ben, you have Big Bentley. Clever.<br/><br/>Lots of action, races, gadgets, etc. But..... where is the heart? Pixar has always treated us to stories that placed the characters and the relationships at the centre of the story, without compromising on the action and the humour. Here, the concept is interesting - spy cars, with all the gadgets you can imagine, and races around the world - but it's more a pretext than a real story.<br/><br/>I remember reading somewhere, back in the good old days of independent Pixar, that they were never going to make sequels just for the sake of sequels. Toys Story 2 and 3 were excellent sequels, with enough meat to be real movies in themselves, so in this way, we can't consider them just mere ""sequels"". Cars 2, on the contrary, feels exactly like the kind of sequel that you make when you have great characters that are going to sell a lot of movie-related stuff - toy cars, lunch bags, pj's for little boys and all that crap. The characters are half developed, a lot more caricatured than what Pixar has ever used us to. The heart of the story - which would be Mater feeling like he is not accepted the way he is I guess - is very superficially treated; in the end, we never really cared.<br/><br/>All that being said, it's still better than a whole lot of stupid animated movies that movie studios churn out every year. But it's not Pixar anymore.<br/><br/>I felt sad as I walked out; Pixar is finally bowing down to almighty Disney."

","Cars 1 was their least ambitious film. The story was predictable and character development obvious making it their most mediocre film. It was good but it lacked that little extra touch that made their films great. However, they had some great side characters, a heart, and wonderful scenes that elevated it up beyond most other films. But ever since this film's announcement I always wondered why. McQueen had his story and there's not much else to tell. Like Finding Nemo, where else is there to go? And I'd rather see sequels to better movies like The Incredibles, even Bug's Life seems to have more potential. It's easy to see why they made a sequel to it, since all you need to do is go to Disneyland or any Disney Store and see it covered in McQueen and Mater, which happened to be two my of three year-old cousin's first words. Off all the Pixar films, Cars made the most with the merchandise.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is the story. Cars 1, while predictable, was touching. Cars 2 has almost no heart or character development. The focus shifts from McQueen to Mater. McQueen had his story in the first and there's little to tell here. He has one character moment that's essentially the same realization as the first film's. The problem with Mater is that he's such a simple character. Everything about him is on the surface for all to see. He's the same person throughout the movie, with one predictable realization which goes no where, that he doesn't warrant his own film. He's like Kronk from The Emperor's New Groove. They're both terrific side characters but lack enough complexity for a full story. And Larry the Cable Guy has always been better with the other Blue Collar guys rather than on his own."

Pixar efforts have been so well done because they were collaborative efforts, each fixing each other's problems to make a better project. But with Lasseter off working more directly with Disney, he really should have had a co-director or perhaps given the reins to someone else like he did with Toy Story 3.<br/><br/>I almost rated this movie higher. It is fun while you're watching it, even if as soon as it's over it becomes too easy to pick apart the problems. But this is Pixar. They've dominated the animation market since Toy Story and have been pushing the boundaries at the Academy Awards ever since. To see them stumble with a not-so-great film would be one thing. But they're coming off from two Best Picture nominees to a movie that's simply flashy but with little substance. Kids will love the bright colors and silly antics, but parents will hate having to then buy twelve new Mater toys. Cars 2 is stalled and in need of a tune-up."
"diehard-305","6","0","1","12 July 2011"," The look is impressive
","The look is impressive but not more than anything else Pixar's done. With each movie, the studio has pushed the graphics into new levels. Each movie has had some wow moment where audiences can't help but be amazed by what they're seeing. There were times in Cars 1 when it looked almost real. Cars 2 lacks any wow factor. One of the most impressive sets, Tokyo, were already spoiled by the Tokyo Mater short. This more than anything makes me wonder if Pixar was even trying to up the ante or if they were just using what they had to make a movie a year.<br/><br/>Spies and Cars seems to work well together. After all, any Bond or Bourne film will easily demonstrate why the two go together. Indeed, the opening scene on the drilling platform is easily the best with the fast chase and cool gadgets. But they weren't able to properly combine the racing and spy elements, almost as if you're watching two movies at once. There's too much spy stuff for the racing to be interesting, which becomes pointless against the overpowering and overly clichÃ©d spy story. Perhaps Pixar should have set it as simply a spy movie set in the Cars universe and had McQueen and his friends in cameos or as a background story.<br/><br/>Another lousy spot is the music. Cars 1 had a terrific soundtrack with excellent uses of popular songs like Life is a Highway and Route 66. But there's not one memorable song or music cue in this movie. Giacchino usually does terrific work like with The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and Up. But he too fumbles the ball here. Perhaps he was just uninspired by what he had to work with.<br/><br/>Cars is Lasseter's pet project. But I think he's too close to it. He's got that Lucas Star Wars prequel trilogy problem.

You see, the way Cars 2 began was just perfectly stating that this was a sequel and introducing the Cars experience to new viewers. Although a bit confusing at the very start, it doesn't matter because it's new info to everyone. This movie welcomes many new characters and does a very good job of keeping all of the characters from the previous movie. I believe that this movie gives you a lot of action and fantasy that it should have. Because the movie is an animation it doesn't need to be like the first Cars where there is no real fantasy.

Race car Lightning McQueen and his best friend Mater travel to compete in the World Grand Prix. Cars 2 brings back our favorite car friends in this excellent adventure movie!<br/><br/>My favorite characters are Lightning McQueen, Mater, and Finn McMissile. I like Lightning McQueen because he is really fast and he is really friendly. I like Mater because he is a really funny character and he doesn't always know what's going on. But even if he doesn't know what's going on he is always the best friend McQueen could ever have. I like Finn McMissle because he is a great spy car and he helps Mater to see who he really is. Mater realizes that he is perfect just the way he is.<br/><br/>My favorite part of this movie is when Mater is being a spy and gets into a fire fight with the bad cars, but not on purpose! He says, ""Dag Gum,"" and then a gun pops out of his truck. Then he said, ""Oh shoot,"" and then the gun starts shooting! And then he said, ""Not that kind of shoot,"" and then a parachute popped out of his truck and he started to fly away. It was sooo funny!<br/><br/>The animation and special effects in this movie are really cool. The bright lights and colors in the cars is amazing. The opening scene where Crabby is coming through the ocean is really cool. They had to use a lot of computer graphics in order to make the water actually look like it is waves. And of course the explosions are super cool.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie for ages three and up. This movie does have some violence but it isn't really scary or noticeable to younger kids.

They compared it to Cars, and it was different, and it was not what they were looking for.<br/><br/>So when you see the movie, treat it as an action movie, rather than part sentimental part action movie like other Pixar offerings.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Mater's adventures quite a bit. To be honest, even in the first movie, Lightning McQueen's character can be a bit annoying. So I did not mind the break. I am not a fan of any of that blue collar comedy stuff, but Larry the Cable guy is quite amusing as Mater, who is obviously the star in this movie. Deal with it! :) The animation is AWESOME. Check out the buildings in Europe. Amazing. The bright glowingness of Japan. Cool. When in London, look at all the details, such as traffic moving across the Tower Bridge. It made me happy to see such craftsmanship in the animation.<br/><br/>Car fans should love all the car talk. How can you not love a movie which highlights the ""failures"" we laughed at in the 70s, such as the Gremlin! They had some fun cars you don't often see, like the 3-wheeled car (and I have seen some 3-wheeled mini cars in museums, so fun.) F1 fans should appreciate the appearance by David Hobbs - they even used what sounded like real F1 engine sounds in one scene. The race scenes, all too short for my tastes were well done - some of the most fun racing animation I have seen.<br/><br/>If you like action movies, spy movies, gadgets, state of the art animation, car jokes similar to all the flintstones rock related jokes, references to lesser known cars and Mater, how can you not like this movie?

","One of the best movie reviews ever written came from the pen of Roger Ebert while talking about the movie ""2010."" In short, Ebert wrote that as good as 2010 might be, people's memory of the original film -- ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" -- would so forever cloud their judgment that ""2010"" could never be given a fair shake.<br/><br/>Given that the original ""Cars"" is, to some, Pixar's best work, and certainly no worse than a solid effort, the sequel is going to have difficulty gaining traction. And like many, I was perplexed as to what exactly there was left to do with this story arc.<br/><br/>Whereas the first movie is an ode to pre-Interstate America and gives a slap to the anti-car joykillers among us, this movie is not similar in any way save for the characters it uses to tell the story. The original ""Cars"" is a needed lesson for not throwing away or being dismissive of our past; ""Cars 2"" is James-Bond-meets-Cannonball-Run.<br/><br/>Fans of the spirit of the first movie, therefore, will have to find a way to detach before they can enjoy it. The supporting cast of the first film is essentially MIA. The supporting cast of the new film doesn't engender the same level of concern or interest. This is basically a two-man show, Mater and McQueen, and fortunately enough the writing is good enough to float the ship.<br/><br/>Where this movie stands out is in its presentation, graphics, pacing and look. It is just as fast as the original movie is slow. And it has several thunderously funny moments thanks to a clever script and a brief glimpse into the life of owning British automobiles.<br/><br/>Not Pixar's best by any stretch, but still light years better than what other animation studios are coming up with."

On the surface the movie appears to be about the Grand Prix of Racing featuring Lighting McQueen and his dear friend Mata taking the audience on a whirlwind tour of Tokoyo, Italy and London as Lighting McQueen struggles to defeat his arch nemesis from Italy but this movie has an underlying message for young and old alike that being the value of a friend and of being yourself in a world that often wants you to be someone else. Cars 2 features once again that old junk tow truck Mata who has seen too many miles and too many tow trips yet still lingers on. Mata is the kid in your old neighborhood clumsy, geeky, uncoordinated and foolish, you know the kid that when you were choosing sides for your sandlot baseball game as a kid everyone took last and have him play right field. But true to form that clumsy, geeky, uncoordinated and foolish kid is a loyal, sweet, tried and true friend that you can count on when you are in a jam, Cars 2 is an action packed thriller and the 3D affects are awesome.

Since ""Toy Story"" back in 1995, Pixar has been turning out one great top-of-the-line animated picture after another. These animators aren't satisfied to just throw off a bit of weekend entertainment, they are making films that are going to be enjoyed and loved for years to come.<br/><br/>""Cars 2"" isn't their best work, but it does what it does very well. It doesn't have the emotional pull of ""Toy Story 3"" or ""Up"". Nor does it have the originality of ""WALL-E"" or ""Ratatouille"", but what is has is a look and an energy all its own. Unlike so many sequels that cynically march along through a clone retread of the original, ""Cars 2"" expands on the idea of the original and takes its story on the road.<br/><br/>""Cars"", you will recall, took place entirely in a universe where cars are the dominate species and featured the adventures of speed junkie Lightening McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson), a hot-shot race car who got stalled in Radiator Springs where the way of life was a lot slower then he was use to. ""Cars 2"" leaves Radiator Springs behind and shows us that this world not only involves living, breathing cars but also planes, trains, boats, construction vehicles, you name it. It kicks off when get involved in the European World Cup championship where his arch rival is an Italian Formula One race car named Francesco Bernoulli (voiced by John Turturro).<br/><br/>That car race is only a small bit of the film, however. Most of the story is taken up Lightning's best buddy Mater the Tow Truck (voice of Larry the Cable Guy) falling into an exciting spy adventure. Mater accompanies Lightening to Europe as part of his pit crew, but his uncultured manner (he mistakes wasabi for Pistachio Ice Cream) gets him mistaken for a secret agent working undercover. A James Bond-ish Aston Martin named Finn McMissle (voice of Michael Caine) is on the case with his girl-Friday Holley Shiftwell (voice of Emily Mortimer). They are trying to uncover a plot by old gas guzzlers to give alternative fuels a bad name. Mater, through his accidental incompetence, uncovers the scheme.<br/><br/>Where the first film centered on Lightning, this one becomes Mater's story. He and Lightening have a disagreement over Mater's country-fried manner and that sets off the much larger spy plot that is far more exciting than I thought it would be. Plus, I'll admit that the mystery had me going. There is a surprise at the end of the film that I didn't see coming. Maybe I was too distracted just looking at the backgrounds. The movie has wonderful gags that are surprising and funny especially when Mater is fitted with voice activated weaponry that is set off by his country vernacular - especially when he says ""Shoot!"" What is special about ""Cars 2"" is that, like ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" earlier this year, it opens up the world created in the first film and takes its story in a new direction. The canvas created here goes to Japan, France, Italy and England where the frame of the film is packed with hundreds of different kinds of cars and car in-jokes, many of which will be missed on the first viewing. The animators were generous with their visuals, allowing our eyes to find small details in the corners and in the backgrounds so that this world seems populated by more than just the characters in the center.<br/><br/>I love the new characters, in particular Finn McMissle, a James Bond-style car who sneaks around on pulleys and wires and has an array of dazzling weaponry. I loved the shiny Holley Shiftwell who loves on Mater in a sweet little romance. I love the German auto villain with his large monocle. I even loved the Pope Mobile, which rides around on the back of, well, another Pope mobile.<br/><br/>""Cars 2"" may not be Pixar's best film but it is miles ahead of most animated films I've seen lately. The writers and the animators really tried to create something special here, not just a movie that gives us our money's worth. They created a fun, exciting world here made completely out of cars and fueled by their imaginations.<br/><br/>***1/2 (of four)"

","The original Cars movie was a great story wonderfully built up all the way to the end. There were several subtle themes along the way: Route 66, the old streets connecting the world, and about friendship, faith and courage.<br/><br/>I never watched NASCAR, was never a racing fan, and even I know what ""pit stop"" means now.<br/><br/>Cars 2, God only knows what it is. A spy caper? Why? And even if it was, at least it could have been built up to a crescendo.<br/><br/>From Tokyo to Paris to Porta Corsa to London, and then on to Radiator Springs, the movie zips along at such a furious pace, without making the pieces glue together as a narrative. Even the moral, to be what you are, is as hollow as it can be.<br/><br/>My son, a huge fan of the Cars movie, wanted to get out within an hour. He is OK with me buying him Cars 2 toys, the Finn McMissiles, but he doesn't want me to buy the DVD at all. That says it all."

","........THERE ARE NO SPOILERS.......THERE ARE NO SPOILERS........... CARS2 is a movie that is aimed at kids. So what purpose would my review serve? NONE. I am not going to go into how good Pixar films are. I am not going to say that they can't all be winners. The truth of the matter is this. The movie is aimed at kids and not adults. If you take your kids or grandkids to see this or any other movie and they enjoy it then that is all that matters. The people who have written negative reviews are not looking at this movie from the perspective of a child. If they like it then gosh it must be a good movie. There is action in this movie and older kids may find the story to be more interesting then the first installment. I myself did enjoy the movie. I certainly did not think it was as bad as the reviews would lead you to believe."
"ththaymes378","7","0","2","1 July 2011"," Better than you'd think it would be.
","The critics may have jumped the gun on this one. Cars 2 is just as fun as most other animated movies. Not as good as the rest of Pixar's output, but at least on the level of other animated films like Rio. I found it to be highly entertaining and exciting. Mater actually makes for a good protagonist and Larry the Cable Guy is well used in this movie. This film isn't exactly well- written, but it has a strong enough emotional arc and appealing visuals to make up for it. My only serious complaint was that ""Git-R-Done"" wasn't uttered once in this film. It may not be as good as Toy Story 3, but Cars 2 is certainly not a bad movie."
"pacocastillo1","7","0","4","1 July 2011"," I don't know why the people expected more of Cars 2
","Cars was the worst Pixar movie ever, without imagination and creativity. The plot is copied of ""Michael J Fox - Dr Hollywood"". The difference is that in one you have doctors an in the other cars. For me is boring ans slow once McQueen get lost in that forbidden town. you can't get watermelons if you seed pineapples. Pixar did their first great mistake (the first one was Bugs and the second is Cars), but this one is silly and only searching for incomes instead to continue with that way giving us mature stories as Up & Wall-E. They believe the kids are stupid, but the best sequence in Pixar movies was the story of the couple of UP. The kids really learned about life and death."
"kgny309","Null","0","3","1 July 2011"," ""Cars 2 "" is a good ride for families
","If you're looking for another Pixar masterpiece, you'll won't find it here. But if you are looking for a good time at a family movie this summer, Pixar's ""Cars 2"" is just the ride, no matter which version you see it in {3-D and 2-D}.<br/><br/>In this sequel to the hit 2006 film, Mater mistakenly becomes a secret spy, while his friend Lighting Mcqueen rides in the World Grand Prix. Mater uncovers a plan to stop Allinol gasoline.<br/><br/>Most of the voice cast is back, with some brand new characters. Owen Wlison is good but a little underused as Lighting. Michael Caine and Emily Mortimer are both clever and smart respectively as two new characters,Finn McMissile and Holley Shiftwell. John Turturro is very funny as Lighting's newest rival, Francesco Bernoulli. But the movie's real star is Larry the Cable Guy as Mater. He steals the picture from start to finish.<br/><br/>John Lasseter is back in the director's chair and he gives the picture its magical, cool and dazzling vision. Ben Queen's script is smart and outrageous. Michael Giacchino's hot score helps gives the film its magic touch.<br/><br/>This movie is hip and cool as it gets. Together with a brand new remarkable short featuring the gang from ""Toy Story 3"", it makes it a perfect time at the movies for the whole family.<br/><br/>My pick: Green light {See It}"
"sergiusbarretto","8","0","2","1 July 2011"," Nice, Great if you loved cars 1 and you like real 'cars' in general
","There has been a lot of negative reviews for the movie, sure it is not as charming as the 1st one. But I personally think you should never compare sequels to the earlier movies. Sure they have the same characters and are in some ways continuations, but for the most of it they are different movies. If you love real cars then this movie is just super. It's cleverly funny e.g. The car Lewis Hamilton has a gap in his teeth just like the real Lewis. Besides these small smile moments there are of course funny dialogs. Watch it! its fun. And the whole spy element is quite refreshing in a Pixar movie. It may of course make you want to go and see a Bond flick."
"vales_cosmin","8","0","2","30 June 2011"," Cars 2
","Cars 2 just opened in theatres and you can probably guess what my four year old son wanted to do this morning.<br/><br/>Well to be honest he has wanted to do it ever since I was stupid enough to play the trailer for him. Never play a trailer for a small child they don't get the concept of 'its a trailer' and you will regret it for the rest of the night. So after that fiasco I was finally able to take my son to see it and I and he can report back with our feedback.<br/><br/>I am including his comments in my review because to be fair who cares what a 30 year old male thinks when the demographic is clearly small children 8 years and under.<br/><br/>Lets start with the premise for those who may have not been following the sequel; Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson)and Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) take their friendship to new places when they head overseas to compete in the first-ever World Grand Prix to determine the world's fastest car. But the road to the championship is filled with plenty of potholes, detours and hilarious surprises when Mater gets caught up in an intriguing adventure of his own: international espionage.<br/><br/>Torn between assisting Lightning McQueen in the high-profile race and towing the line in a top-secret spy mission, Mater's action-packed journey leads him on an explosive chase through the streets of Japan and Europe, trailed by his friends and watched by the whole world. Adding to the fast-paced fun is a colorful new all-car cast that includes secret agents, menacing villains and international racing competitors.<br/><br/>I have to start by saying I never saw the original Cars movie because for whatever reason as much as I am a huge Pixar fan the premise fell flat with me. Talking cars? No thanks. That said my son loved the first film and has all the toys, the stickers, and even has his room wallpapered with Cars characters. So to say I was really excited to take him to see the sequel was an understatement despite the fact my interest level was just above zero at best. Unfortunately Cars 2 is exactly what I feared it would be and maybe a little bit worse.<br/><br/>Cars 2 offers some top notch animation, big name voice over's and even include some interesting cameos like that of Sig Hansen Captain of the Northwestern from the show Deadliest Catch on Discovery Channel. It has a few laughs, it has some action but it also has a good 45-60minutes of drawn out character interactions that made my little guy drift off from why we were there and at about the half way mark of the movie he was ready to get up and make a ruckus.<br/><br/>Cars 2 comes off to me as an unneeded sequel and although it had its laughs and some high points and when I asked my son what he thought he said 'it was good daddy' and when I asked him 'would you like to see another cars movie?' he replied 'lets watch something else'. He may have seen the first film easily 20 times but its safe to say that neither myself nor my 4 year old are interested in seeing it twice. Cars 2 was boring, drawn out and offered very little entertainment for me as an adult and very limited entertainment value for my 4 year old.<br/><br/>It cost us $40 when you include the popcorn and drinks and frankly I think I would have been further ahead to rent one of the Top 10 Pixar Movies on Luke's new top list for $3.99 then go see Cars 2. My advice is skip it and watch it on DVD. My kid is a huge huge CARS fan and knows every character and he was extremely distracted and bored and made it clear after he had fun but is in no rush to see it or anymore cars movies again. I can honestly say the highlight was the 8 minute long Toy Story short film at the start of the movie which was both funny, charming and entertaining. Everything Cars 2 was not. Can watch it on BBCmovie.com"

","Warning: This review was translated from Spanish electronically. Any misunderstanding, please consult with me before. This review contains spoilers, it is recommended that before you read, watch the movie.<br/><br/>Since creating the first commercial feature film entirely designed and computer-animated ""Toy Story"" in 1995, Pixar - Disney has been characterized for creating animated fantasy worlds using new techniques of 3D animation. Their stories are everyday characters for our lives but at the same time are transformed into unique characters, such as toys that never leaves you, a fish of a coral reef, a rat cook, a race car, an ant, an old man a house fly with balloons, and innovative imagined and created such characters as a series of monsters to scare (not scare), a compact robot that collects trash and a family of superheroes. This time gave way to the second part of the race car ""Lightning McQueen's"" that or rather ""who"" in the first part was the protagonist of a story which aired speed small a message about the importance of friendship and humility. In this second part of Cars, the role of ""Lightning McQueen"" he eclipsed his best friend Mater a ""Tow Truck"" who in the first half was like the actor. Despite the naivety and stupidity of Mater, managed to confuse two British intelligence officers who mistook him for a spy and in turn recruited to complete the mission they were assigned. The two friends travel to Europe after McQueen Mater rolled in a global race against an Italian F-1 car,organized by a guy who intends to commercialize a fuel alternative to gasoline. Parts of the plot felt bored, because of the complexity of the circumstances presented, particularly felt I was seeing a chapter of ""Chavo del 8"" and the confusions, misunderstandings, assumptions and other entanglements, made the ""stupid tow truck"" enlisted with secret agents, apparently experts, and these have not been able to decipher the true identity of Mater. Besides that, a secret agent was ""a"" lovely car, which end is known as the girlfriend of Mater. Mater, performed the tasks most spectacular in its ""life"" would have dreamed of, such as flying on a parachute powered by rockets installed deceive a stack of ""Mafia"", among others. Leaving the main character, ""Lightning McQueen"" as a simple race car. Another small detail was that he played down Sally, Lightning McQueen's girlfriend, who only came at the beginning and end of the film. The film is for children, but the plot is presented can be confusing and complex even for an adult. It is assumed that these movies are for fun and laugh as dwarf the duration of the movie, enjoy a stay with good animation and a message. However I felt I had to decipher a series of paradoxes, remember the key issues and dealing with assumptions. Moreover, the Pixar animation is pretty good and the level of detail in backgrounds, lights, shadows and textures is sublime, it highlights many European landscapes such as Paris, London and the Italian Riviera. The characters are excellent, and now introduced an antagonist, which is not allowed to reveal until the end of the film, adding some excitement to the poor plot. Latin Spanish Dubbing is very good although a bit colloquial idioms that are used in Mexico. Thanks to Pixar for the film, but the story did not meet my expectations, a score of 10 on IMDb I put the first, the second under 7. No doubt the animated film produced by Pixar Animation Studios, my least liked, the story and plot. But I give the title of ""Popcorn Sunday."""

","The original is always the best. Cars 2 was not as bad as the critics are making it out to be. It may not have been one Pixars best films and they usually knock their movies out of the park even when they are sequels but what does it matter if the critics and adults don't like it? After all these movies are for kids and if the kids like them then they succeeded. Even though I didn't enjoy it quite as much as my 5 year old nephew did it shouldn't matter what I think. He loved every minute of it! That is their target audience so Pixar did well once again. I kind of liked that this story was about Mater and not McQueen and that new characters were introduced. That could have been why critics didn't like. I also liked that they go outside of Radiator Springs and travel the world."
"wuzimu93","6","0","1","28 June 2011"," Meh for me... Maybe kids will like it more!
","I have two younger half brothers, each 5 and 3 and they are both die hard Cars fans. They have seen the original movie at least 100 times and even my parents have managed to pick out the little things because they've been forced to see it so many times. As a treat, I decided to take my 5 year old brother to Cars 2 (because the 3 year old really doesn't like to sit for an entire movie). I wasn't expecting it to be a super awesome sequel but awaited what was in store for me.<br/><br/>I have to say I was bored many times throughout the movie, it seemed too serious with the spy aspect going on and at many times felt way too advanced for children. I chuckled a few times throughout the movie, but my brother wasn't responding nearly as much as he did to the first film. I wanted to see more of the old Radiator Springs cast, and I thought Mater already had his moments of fame in all of those Cars Toons shorts.<br/><br/>It was interesting to see what happened with the plot, but as I said to me it was presented in such a boring fashion, and there were many technical things (going all out about car parts and such) that would go over many kid's heads. Now sure that might be included for the adult audience, but it didn't entertain me it only made me ask: Why are they putting all of this automobile technical mumbo jumbo in a kid's movie? If it makes any difference, my little brother's review was that he liked the movie more than the first because ""It had Francesco in it!"" But I don't know if that will be enough to keep all the other kids watching this entertained. My final verdict is if you liked the first Cars, the second one is worth a watch if you're interested in it but just don't think you'll be wowed or impressed in any way."

","The idea of taking the spotlight off McQueen is a development that the writers and the screenplay writers hoped will make the movie one for the Oscars. Well...it didn't quite pan out that way, and ended up missing the mark. The movie has some thrilling races, wonderful sceneries, if there is an award for best animation scenery shots OH! Cars will get it.<br/><br/>Pixar is Known for its memorable animations, pulling out Characters like the ones we see in Finding Nemo and Toy Story, Challenging our imagination Ratatouille and Monsters Inc, matured action like that from The Incredibles and of course the emotional touch of Up and WALL-E, but like the first Cars which fell short of the other master pieces this one too follow suit.<br/><br/>Cars 2 fall behind of all the greatest from Pixar except its original Cars. This is the first Pixar animation am sure won't put up a fight for best animation in the Oscars. Cars originally have a weak story and the sequel just made it glaring. Preferable to the original though cause of the fast paced scenes and it still had its humorous times the movie itself seems to be made for kids.<br/><br/>It has a G rating and I recall asking myself, hey isn't that a torture scene, and I also recall going I think that Car (also those Cars) are dead.<br/><br/>I guess its high time studios take a pause from all this part 2, 3 or 4. Cause it's starting to get old.<br/><br/>Here is the plot, Lightning McQueen has been challenged to a series of races by the Italian speedster Francesco Bernoulli, a challenge he accepted. Sally then convinces him to take Mater with him. Somewhere else, the smooth Bond like British spy car Finn McMissile (Michael Caine), assisted by Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer), are trying to foil a plot by a criminal mastermind.<br/><br/>Now the criminal mastermind's plot is so twisted and complicated that after you figure it out in a sec, you say ""hmm!!!"" The British spies by some rare coincidence mistake the bumbling tow trucker Mater for an American spy, and the rusty cling cling and the two spies engage in a thrilling adventure, to saveÂ…""the financial market, and also Cars of cause"""

"GunsmokeRocks","5","0","1","27 June 2011"," Critics criticized, but for the wrong reasons.
",". It's not often that I get to see a movie on opening weekend, so I thought I would write something about it, since many of the critics on Rotten Tomatoes seem to just not get it. Some say the plot was hard to follow, it was not. Some were Southern-phobics, who had problems with Mater, I do not. Some said that they did not like the first ""Cars"", and that just rips away any credibility that they might have had with me.<br/><br/>The original ""Cars"" was awesome. It was a parody of ourselves using something we love the most--cars. The story was basically the same as the old Michael J. Fox flick ""Doc Hollywood"", but the jokes, the music and the artful animation still made it a great movie. Unfortunately, ""Cars 2"" , in comparison, only has the artful animation.<br/><br/>Most Pixar flicks have some movie or genre of movies in which they take their underlying style. For example, ""A Bug's Life"" uses ""The Magnificent Seven"", ""Up"" uses ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", and ""The Incredibles"" take a A LOT from the Sean Connery James Bond movies. Unfortunately, they must not have gotten enough out of James Bond, because they resort much of this with ""Cars 2"", and the attempt is far less subtle and creative. This also contradicts all the effort made to relate personally to the cars in the previous film.<br/><br/>Imagine if a movie like ""Cowboy vs. Aliens"" was the sequel to ""Dances With Wolves"". It just wouldn't work. ""Cars"" parodied much of everyday life and ""Cars 2"" just turned it all into an action movie and the filmmakers should have known better! It also seems that the effort was not all there for this one either. ""Cars"" had some great gags and visuals placed during musical numbers throughout the film. ""Cars 2"" only had one of these numbers and it was pretty lame. It was song originally performed by the Cars and it wasn't even sung by them. There was very little to laugh at.<br/><br/>The story in itself was not too bad, but the moral in it was the weakest that Pixar has presented and still was not that different from ""The Incredibles"".<br/><br/>There was also fairly obvious scenes that were in there to boost toy sales. The product placement for State Farm was atrocious. Since when does the might Pixar have to rely on product placement? Pitiful! Finally, it's rated G, but IMO, it should really be PG. Yeah, the violence is just cars against cars, but cars are personified and killing them by blowing them up or hitting them with a death ray can still be intense.<br/><br/>."
"fjhuerta-2","4","0","3","26 June 2011"," Pixar's Edsel.
","It had to happen. Nobody's perfect, and they had to fail sometime.<br/><br/>And it's not that it's a bad movie. Far from it. It's just that whenever I see Lasseter and Bird's names, the LAST thing I can think about is a mediocre movie. I'm one of the very few people (apparently enough) who LOVES Cars - so I really was waiting for its sequel.<br/><br/>I should have known after watching Tron: Legacy. John Lasseter is losing his magic touch. If he was really involved on that movie's plot, then something happened to his movie-making talent. This, the next movie he's involved in, suffers from the same problems.<br/><br/>I won't spoil the movie for you - you already know what it's all about, anyway. The story is far too complex for a kid (I was left scratching my head at the end about certain things). There are too many new characters to care about. The show is stolen by Mater, and not in a good way - he was funny in the first movie as a supporting character, but he's just not likable enough to carry the movie all by himself; I was expecting a Lightning McQueen movie, after all. When it all comes down to it, the plot is absolutely unremarkable - and that's quite a remarkable thing, considering this is Pixar we are talking about.<br/><br/>I *suppose* this has to do with the Mouse House. Back when Pixar was an independent studio they could do anything they could ever want. Now they are part of a bigger company, and they seem to be following their directions. Why? Well, have you seen Disney's California Adventure? That park was a disgrace, and part of the things they are doing to fix it is creating - yep, you guessed it - Radiator Springs, which will be opened in 2012. I can imagine the pressure was on Pixar to create a sequel to a sort of unloved movie, and as much as Lasseter and Bird tried to create something like The Incredibles, they ended up with, yep, you guessed again, their brand new Edsel.<br/><br/>Here's hope Pixar can do a comeback with their next film."
