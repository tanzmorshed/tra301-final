","Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.<br/><br/>Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.<br/><br/>The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.<br/><br/>Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors. Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz. Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults.<br/><br/>Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things!"

","I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago.<br/><br/>The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy's birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don't want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their ""leader"" because he's the most popular one of them all. He's the only one that hasn't got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other...<br/><br/>When you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren't always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that's true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren't yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10."
"ccthemovieman-1","10","94","104","18 February 2007"," Excellent Viewing, Every Time!
","This is a very clever animated story that was a big hit, and justifiably so. It had a terrific sequel and if a third film came out, that would probably be a hit, too.<br/><br/>When this came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome. Now, it's routine because animation, which took a giant leap with this movie, has made a lot more giant strides.<br/><br/>The humor in here, however, is what made this so popular. There are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others. As good as Hanks is as ""Woody"" and Allen as ""Buzz Armstrong,"" I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc.<br/><br/>Multiple viewings don't diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed ""winner"" as is the sequel."

","Toy Story – 5/5 stars<br/><br/>Children play with toys. It is a known fact. At one time or another, we all played with toys, whether they were action figures, dolls, little green soldiers, etc But what if toys were real? What if they could talk?<br/><br/>Pixar and Disney serve us this theory in what was the first full-length computer-animated film ever, 'Toy Story,' chronicling the events in the life of a cowboy doll, Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks).<br/><br/>Woody is the favorite toy of his owner, a small child named Andy. Andy brings Woody everywhere, and cherishes him, as we see in the beginning of the film. However, this all changes on Andy's birthday when Andy gets a new toy: a Buzz Lightyear doll (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody is suddenly forgotten, left with the rest of his friends: Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney, better known as Ernest) and Ham (see if you can guess the voice of this one? I'll give you a hint: 'Cheers'). <br/><br/>But after Buzz accidentally gets knocked out an upstairs window, Woody is the prime suspect. Now, after Woody and Buzz end up next door, in toy killer Sid's house, Woody must prove his innocence by getting both Buzz and him back to Andy's house safely.<br/><br/>'Toy Story' builds on an element we all shrug off carelessly and thoughtlessly. Much like they did last year with monsters under the bed, Pixar took the theory of live toys to a new level in 'Toy Story,' filling our minds with endless possibilities.<br/><br/>What Pixar does is a strange thing. It doesn't just try to expand our mind, but also out world. I respect and enjoy that. In 'Monsters, Inc.,' Pixar managed to preach to us 'What if monsters under the bed are real, and what if they have a world much like ours, and have feelings like humans,' while never forgetting the equally important formula of humor. Much is the same with their earlier film 'Toy Story.' What if those wooden and plastic toys we all played with as kids are real? What if they have feelings, emotions, voices, and human qualities? An interesting idea by itself, but when mixed with a wicked sense of humor and reality, you've got yourself one of the best films ever.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody. Pixar must have modeled the doll's expressions and movements after Hanks, because after a while, I feel like I AM watching Hanks on screen, and NOT a computer-generated image. When you get to the point of not being able to tell animation from reality, you know that the voices are good.<br/><br/>The same goes for Tim Allen, though the body gestures were most likely not modeled after Allen's physical expressions (Buzz is a short, pot-bellied toy).<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is excellent, all very believable and entertaining. You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing.<br/><br/>I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was 'A Bug's Life,' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had.<br/><br/>Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. 'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30's-60's: Respect for the audience's intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made – something that fans like me would rather have than something like 'Finding Nemo.'<br/><br/>'Toy Story' 1 & 2 are both on my 'favorite films' list. It may sound stupid, but if I made up a top 250 list like IMDb.com, both of those films would be on there; so would 'Monsters Inc.' After an unpromising trailer for Pixar's upcoming film 'Finding Nemo,' I think that after their licensing deal with Disney is disputed (they have to cough up five more ORIGINAL films – not sequels – by 2005), they should definitely try to make a 'Toy Story 3.' I'll be first in line for it, anyway."

","Y'know, I always suspected that my toys were coming to life when I wasn't looking! <br/><br/>In Andy's Room, his toys lead lives of noisy desperation come every birthday and Christmas - no one wants to be one-upped by a new addition to the toy box. Nominally led by Cowboy Woody (there's a Brokeback joke in there just waiting to happen), Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Ham the piggybank, Bo Peep, Slinky the dog and a smattering of other playthings go about their toy business of playing checkers, hanging with the hometoys and ""plastic corrosion awareness meetings,"" until Andy's birthday party, when they gather expectantly around a transistor radio, listening to the reports of their toy soldier troops ""in the field"" (downstairs watching Andy's gift-opening), hoping that no gift will be exciting enough to cause Andy to neglect *them.* There is. His name is Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger.<br/><br/>Directed by Pixar mainstay John Lasseter, with the voice talents of Tom Hanks (as Woody), Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger (forever Cliff from *Cheers*), R. Lee Ermey, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and Tim Allen (as Buzz), *Toy Story* is that *rara avis* that succeeds on all levels  in its animation, storyline, character development, its messages of friendship and self-realization and, most importantly, its entertainment value. The fact that this is a cartoon (or animated feature  just what DO we call this new wave of computer-generated movies?) is incidental. Which makes the slightly dodgy animation (of the ""real people"") irrelevant - it gets the point across with or without the technological finesse.<br/><br/>The ""Disney Movie"" has become synonymous with maudlin messages, redneck fundamentalism, anachronistic family values, boneheaded parents, smart-mouthing youngsters, too-hip-to-be-smart teens and insufferable pets. Though Disney's tyrannical umbrella overarches this film's production studio, Pixar Animation, *Toy Story* somehow avoided all trace of Disney's craven hand, which is doubly surprising, considering this is Pixar's first feature length film, after years of experimentation. Right outa the gate and right outa the field.<br/><br/>Sure, there are ""messages,"" but they are heartfelt, rather than maudlin (Woody tells Buzz during Buzz's greatest depression that it matters not what Buzz thinks of himself, what makes him important is what his owner, Andy, thinks of him); there are emotional segments, which are truly heartbreaking, rather than cheesy (when Buzz's escape attempt lands him with a broken arm, proving he is Not A Flying Toy, the lyric, ""Clearly I will go sailing no more,"" launches a thousand hankies); and the portrayal of Andy's family was Pixar's triumphal achievement. Boldly contravening Disney's *idée fixe* of the 1950's nuclear family and Norman Rockwell fantasies, one of the many incarnations of a modern-day family is presented: a single mother with two kids, who are neither geniuses nor monsters, just normal children; happy to visit Pizza Planet and disappointed when favorite toys are lost.<br/><br/>Buzz  who believes he is a real life space ranger on a mission to save the universe - become Andy's favorite toy over Woody. The funny thing is: though Buzz believes he is real, he still adheres to toy protocol of ""playing inert"" when humans are in the area. (Maybe it's instinct?) When he mentions saving a toy from Sid, the vicious boy next door, how does he propose to do it if he is to adhere to the inert protocol? Buzz's ingenuousness regarding his role as a toy infuriates Woody to the point of attempted toy-assassination. Through a concatenation of accidents, both he and Buzz become lost and must use teamwork, trust and ingenuity to beat their path back to Andy, which finds them ensconced in scorchingly funny vignettes (Buzz fastening himself in an over-sized seatbelt; both falling in with green, three-eyed aliens; Buzz hyperventilating as ""Mrs. Nesbitt""). During a climactic rocket ride, the callback line, ""This is not flying - this is falling with style,"" simply seals this movie's greatness.<br/><br/>At least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master's infallible toy filing system."

","Toy Story is the film that started Pixar Animated Studios into its long string of never ending success. What Pixar does is not just absorb the younger demographic and keep the older ones mildly entertained. It completely absorbs everyone watching no matter the age or the level of maturity, films of Pixar, starting from Toy Story, have kept a certain magical touch around it with an unexpected amount of depth. Everyone as a child imagines their toys will come alive and go on their own adventures. One of the great things Pixar does is that it does not attract audiences with its overloaded superstar casts but rather with its material. The only superstar here is Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned voice over. Unlike what most people think their is an actually a method to casting for animated films as there is to a live-action one. As a result of this Pixar stays faithful to its material and creates a great genuine and warm feeling around the film and its characters."

"Anonymous_Maxine","10","133","171","20 April 2001"," Best Disney film. Ever.
","Toy Story is not only the best Disney film because it has the best story and the best animation, but also because of the excellent actors chosen to provide the voices of the animals. The casting was perfect from top to bottom, and the movie provides an excellent adventure story about friendship and loyalty that keeps you engrossed until the nail-biting climax.<br/><br/>
Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provided excellent voices for Woody and Buzz Lightyear -their performances alone are one of the biggest things that made this such a spectacular movie. Besides that, though, you have the excellent story that is not only noteworthy because it has never really been told from this perspective before, but also because it was just told so well. All of the characters in the film are very well developed and all have appropriate and effective actors chosen to provide their voices. <br/><br/>And of course, who could forget the revolutionary animation! The computer animation used for this movie not only made it startlingly realistic but also opened up tons of possibilities, and thankfully the filmmakers chose to explore these possibilities. There are dozens of things that are hidden in the woodwork throughout the film, as well as in the songs  note, for example, the subtle playing of the Indiana Jones theme song in the scene where Woody knocks Buzz out the window with the desk lamp.<br/><br/>
Toy Story is by far the best Disney film ever made, it's pretty much perfect. It's adventurous, it's exciting, it's entertaining, it's good for the whole family, it's got great characters, story, and plot, and above all, it's fun."

","""I believe that a filmmaker's entire work is contained within his first film; not that it can all be foreseen, but that it can afterwards be verified."" – Francois Truffaut (The Films In My Life) <br/><br/>Buzz Lightyear, a glossy action figure with a sexy sheen, is not a mere toy. He's a Space Ranger, tasked with protecting the universe from the evil Emperor Zurg! His life has meaning, he is unique, his existence has grand purpose! <br/><br/>Woody, a dated cowboy doll, thinks otherwise. He was once a youthful and exuberant toy, the favourite plaything of his owner Andy, but years of existence have shown him the truth: everyone is just a toy, soon to be forgotten and discarded. No one is unique. There is no grand purpose. No universe to save. Better to be a realist, seeing the world without its fake plastic facade and tacky ipod veneer.<br/><br/>Of course Buzz thinks Woody is just a crazy old timer. Doesn't Woody realise that Buzz is a genuine Space Ranger?! That he's a member of the Elite Universe Protection Unit! That he alone has information that reveals Emperor Zurg's weakness! That stupid fool! <br/><br/>Naturally, we the audience identify with Woody. Buzz seems like an idiot, brainwashed and in desperate need of identity and purpose. The Elite Universe Protection Unit merely elevates believers into a position of exaggerated importance. This is an idle fantasy, an other-worldly hope adopted by those who can't face the dour reality that is the ""real world of toys"".<br/><br/>Midway in the film, our heroes stumble across a horde of green alien toys. These aliens worship a giant claw, a mechanical God which they believe will descend and pluck the ""chosen ones"", taking them to some kind of toy heaven. In reality, the claw chooses only deluded souls, and offers them to the devilish Cid Phillips, a sadistic child who mutilates toys. ""Nirvana is coming!"" the aliens whisper, watching as the ""chosen ones"" are airlifted to their deaths.<br/><br/>Buzz Lightyear faces a similar scenario later in the film. Having witnessed a television commercial which advertises a vast range of Buzz Lightyear action figures, Buzz must confront the fact that he really is ""just an ordinary toy"" who ""can not fly"". ""Flying"" thus becomes a sort of Nietzschean metaphor, the ability to transcend the ""flesh"" (in this case, injection moulded plastic) and become ""something more"".<br/><br/>Buzz's first reaction upon seeing the commercial is to seek refuge in denial. ""I am not a toy!"" he says to himself, before climbing to the top of a staircase. Seeking to validate himself by flying, by defying the laws of toy-dom, he takes a giant jump – a literal leap of faith – and of course falls promptly to the ground. He can't fly.<br/><br/>Cue the fastest existential crisis ever seen in a children's film, Buzz Lightyear promptly falling into a deep depression, his faith completely destroyed. His entire existence was based on a lie, a social framework which indoctrinated him into believing that the fate of the whole universe depended on his actions. How can he continue living? Why do anything? What's the point? And more importantly, how the hell did this become a kid's franchise? It's like a demented cartoon by Philip K. Dick (""Do Plastic Toys Dream of Suicide Switches?"").<br/><br/>Then comes the message of the film. Woody tells Buzz that being a Space Ranger doesn't define who he is. His value, status and worth can only be found within the community of toys, on ground level, and not ""up in the skies"". There is no purpose beyond ground zero and our importance lies solely in our ability to bring good to those immediately around us.<br/><br/>Buzz heeds Woody's words and quickly gets over his loss of faith. He stages a daring rescue mission, straps a rocket to his back and flies spectacularly in the air, his newfound love for the ""greater good of his family"" quite literally giving him wings.<br/><br/>In true Zarathustran fashion, Buzz becomes a pint sized Ubermensch figure, a superman who reaches for the sky but is then brought depressingly back down to Earth. If he would just lower his sights, Woody then says, Buzz would find enough reasons to live. Set free of the ""moral code"" imprinted on him by his makers, Buzz thus adopts a new code which, though it puts limits upon him, negating some of his wild ambitions and reducing him, in an existential sense, to a chunk of plastic, still allows for a Nietzschean war cry. This cry, which Buzz yells every time he jumps across that dark abyss, sums up humanity best: ""To Infinity and Beyond!"" <br/><br/>8.9/10 – With its revolutionary visuals, consistent humour, genuine sense of adventure, memorable characters, slick camera work and a couple action/adventure scenes worthy of George Lucas, ""Toy Story"" is a milestone in cinema, and one of the most influential animated films since ""Snow White"".<br/><br/>Most interesting, though, is in observing how Brad Bird reverses Lasseter's themes here with his first Pixar feature, ""The Incredibles"". Brad Bird seems to be the bad boy of Pixar, subverting them from within. Viva la Resistance. Worth multiple viewings."

","Just in case you were also wondering what happened to all the toys that went missing when you were a kid, the answer is clear: They escaped.<br/><br/>""Toy Story"" is the kind of children's movie adults can enjoy just as much, because it very cleverly mines deep deposits of nostalgia from the memory banks. That may be the reason the 1990s bedroom of young Andy is populated by playthings of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. If Andy was a real boy of his time, there would be a computer and a TV/Nintendo, and not much else.<br/><br/>The voicings of the various toys add to the enjoyability. Tom Hanks was the biggest star of the moment when ""Toy Story"" came out, and he works with that likeability by creating a stable center as Woody the cowboy doll. Don Rickles has the screen role of his career (not that ""Kelly's Heroes"" was Oscar material) as a prickly Mr. Potato Head, while Jim Varney and R. Lee Ermey are standouts in the supporting cast.<br/><br/>Tim Allen gives the movie's best performance, as a newfangled toy that takes Woody's place in Andy's heart but can't bring himself to accept that he's just a plastic plaything. It's the role of the story that gives him the best lines (""I don't believe that man has ever been to medical school""), but Allen delivers them with real panache. He more than holds his own, and you kind of see where he took off with that note-perfect William Shatner parody he perfected on screen in the underrated ""Galaxy Quest.""<br/><br/>While this movie's use of computer animation makes it a milestone, it neither represents the most innovative use of the technology or the cleverest Pixar-ated treatment of a story. ""A Bug's Life"" seems a more worthy apex; that story was funnier, worked better on its own merits, and used the animation to better effect. But given how novel all of this was in 1995, ""Toy Story"" could have been a lot less thought-through than it was, and still made gobs of money. The fact it is instead invested with real heart, and can be watched and enjoyed today just as easily as when it debuted nearly 10 years ago, is a tribute to the people behind it.<br/><br/>I like Randy Newman's music, just not here, and while the animation textures are surprisingly lifelike, there are places, especially with Scud the dog but also with the baby's drool, where it falls short. The story itself gets kind of rote with repeat viewings, though the transition to Sid's bedroom and its sad mutilated toys is a genius moment. So too are the vending machine aliens, who gape in rapt wonder at the judgment of ""the claw."" If it reached for pathos a little less often, ""Toy Story"" would be an undeniable classic.<br/><br/>As it is, it is very, very good, the kind of film that's only good for children, even (especially?) the inner ones."

","With the wonderful collaboration of Pixar and Disney, who as of 2013 have given us some of the most visually impressive and wonderful movies ever made. ""Toy Story"" was the go to film of many childhoods (Including my own), and brought CGI movies into the mainstream with stunning promises & confidence.<br/><br/>How things came to be, Lucasfilm sold a portion of their effects company to computer giant Apple (That inevitably became Pixar), who would go on to strike a deal with Disney. Director John Lasseter had lost his job to Disney for pitching the idea of this story, and after the successful development stage he managed to gain back the confidence of Disney, and alas the rest is history.<br/><br/>I bring this story up just to reflect how far we've matured in terms of story telling & technology. The idea of adults giving kids morals & entertainment through animation, wonderfully echoes that of what Walt Disney set out to do so many decades ago. Toy Story has aged extraordinarily well for the first CGI film ever made. Held together mostly for its impeccable casting, I feel ashamed now 20+ years old and much more experienced in movies to say I still look at Tom Hanks & Tim Allen, and almost immediately think ""Toy Story"". As well as the stellar supporting cast, its visuals are fantastic and the music is timeless. Writers include a young Joss Whedon, and with a rotten antagonist by the name of Sid, makes this movie just as entertaining now as it was then.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: It's hard to find any flaw with such a beloved movie, especially the one now most adults will first show their kids. It has everything to move and touch you deeply, and to believe a bunch of 0's and 1's flying around in digital space can do that, ""Toy Story"" is that proof. 10/10."

Released way back in 1999, it was totally different from the usual hand drawn animation, and yet still as vibrant, if not more so. Even now as an 18 year old dude I find it so amazing. Attention to detail has always been Lasseter's strong suit, among many I might add. But the greatest thing about this film was the life evoked into its unique and untouchable characters.<br/><br/>With the voice talents of Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, as well as the hilarious Don Rickles, and the late Jim Varney, the voice acting was perfect and the dialogue was surprisingly intelligent throughout. What could be perceived more or less as a simple story is told with heart and humor, one that hasn't aged a bit since that first viewing.

","I'm 19, going on 20 in six days. I don't need to tell you that ""Toy Story"" is a movie tailor-made for the kiddies, but there's a special reservation for adults too. I should know, as should anyone who views it with an open mind. We've all had our favorite toys. For guys, like me, there's a 90% chance you played with either Transformers or G.I. Joe or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or all three when you were six, seven, eight, or nine years-old. For me, it was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Godzilla action figures. I'd always imagine living out wild fantasy adventures in my room or basement; ah, the joy of being a kid again. But that's part of ""Toy Story's"" fun appeal. It gives you a chance to relive your childhood again. Today I saw for the first time in about eight years and it's still just as fresh and inventive as Pixar, probably the best film studio in computer animation, conceived it back in 1995. In the room of young Andy, the toys are alive - when he's not present of course, and cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is the boy's favorite item. But all that changes on Andy's birthday and a new toy given to him on that day captures the boy's heart - Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen). Of course, any replacement of this sort inspires jealousy, and pretty soon Buzz is the new ""it"" item of the bedroom. Andy's given into everything Buzz Lightyear, even new bedsheets - bedsheets! - leaving poor Woody on the short end of the stick. But the thing is, Buzz has trouble believing he's just a simple toy and nothing more, as he thinks he's actually BUZZ LIGHTYEAR! It also seems this couldn't have come at a worse time for the toys, as Andy and his mother are moving away, which is causing all sorts of chaos as Woody tries to get everything organized so nobody is left behind, and that's exactly what happens with rivals Woody and Buzz, who are misplaced and must find their beloved Andy before they move. Not only that, they must also battle Sid, the serial killer in-training kid that lives next door and tortures toys. As directed by John Lasseter and his army of screenwriters including himself, Andrew Stanton (who would co-direct Pixar's future hit ""Finding Nemo"" in 2003) and Joel Cohen, ""Toy Story"" is true imaginative fantasy realized in superb animation. It more than brings the kid in you to the surface, it makes you want to be a kid again, as many toys have cameos including Army Men (including the Sergeant who's voiced by R.

","When Toy Story came, in 1995,I was 9 years old and it was a remarkable animation;Pixar wasn't famous like today, and we didn't have movies like Shrek and Finding Nemo. But I have to say that even in the present days this movie is awesome and has great graphics. Only to start, the story: The toys have life of their own, and every time we humans are distant from them, they have their lives and their own plans. Woody, until Buzz LightYear comes up,was Andy's favorite toy and also the leader of all of them. Jealous of Buzz's fame, Woody tries to get a rid of him, and because of that is totally ignored by the others toys, who once were his friends and admired him. Looking what he did, Woody goes search Buzz and them many adventures happen."
"OllieSuave-007","8","3","3","27 January 2014"," Infinity and beyond from Disney and Pixar!
","Disney and Pixar studios team up and brought us an imaginative adventure story about a little boy named Andy who loves playing with his toys, with his best friend being a cowboy doll named Woody. However, when Andy and not body else is looking, the toys come to life. Woody is the leader of the toys in Andy's room, which include a Mr. Potato Head, Slinky the Dog, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Pig and Bo-Peep the girl doll. However, when Andy's get new toy space ranger Buzz Lightyear for his birthday, Buzz takes the place of Woody of being leader of the toys and Andy's new best friend. Brewing with jealously, Woody attempts to get rid of Buzz, but both ended up lost outside of Andy's house. As a result, they must find their way back to Andy's house before they move - first trying to get through Andy's weird neighbor and toy torturer Sid.<br/><br/>This is filmed in brilliant and colorful computer animation - very detailed and realistic. The story is full of surprises and adventure, from Woody and Buzz getting lost in a pizza shop to them trying to break loose out of Sid's house to get back to Andy's. The movie is also filled with comedy; you will have to watch the movie to appreciate and understand the humor only live toys could make. And, there are toe-tapping songs you would learn to love including Randy Newman's opening song ""You've Got a Friend in Me."" While this movie's plot is full of non-stop fun and adventure, making every moment exciting and entertaining, the film also concentrates on friendship and teamwork and overcoming all odds. While I mostly enjoyed this movie, I wished that Woody was not made out to be hated on so much by the other toys after Woody's jealous behavior towards Buzz. I thought this takes away at Woody's hero status too much especially for his first movie.<br/><br/>But overall, this is one of Disney's best work, which will make you suspend your disbelief and expand your imagination. Also, hands down to a great voice cast: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Annie Potts and Jim Varney.<br/><br/>Grade B+"

","What a wonderful integration of classic toys and a superb plot. It's a new height in animation (though things have gotten even more impressive long since). The voicings of Tim Allen as Buzz and Tom Hanks as Woody, with their inherent connection to their toy beings, with an incredible supporting cast, make this a romp to end all romps. There is a strain between the realities of the world and the fact that even though they are sentient beings, they are still toys. Buzz has lights that flash but he can't really fly. Woody has the ludicrous string on his back that allows him to deliver his catch phrases. Then there is the neighborhood villain, Sid, who is a maimer and destroyer of toys. There is the quest for the mishandled and lost. And a finale that is worthy of everything that has been set up. What really makes this work is the ""humanity"" of the characters. There is love and a true connection among them. If you have never seen this, it is worth every minute."

","This was the very first computer animated film from Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation, it is just excellent. It is showing what happens when the young Andy leaves his room, his toys come to life! Woody the cowboy is Andy's favourite toy, and looks after all the other toys (and he is a very good Tom Hanks voicing). Unfortunately on Andy's early birthday party he gets a new favourite toy, Buzz Lightyear the space ranger (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody obviously gets jealous and both him and Buzz end up lost, and then in evil Sid's room. For a kid, Sid is a good villain. Woody and Buzz are now trying to find a way to get back to their owner. Also starring Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Jim Varney as Slinky, Annie Potts as Bo Peep, John Morris as Andy, Scream 2's Laurie Metcalf as Andy's Mom, Full Metal Jacket's R. Lee Ermey as Army Sarge and Jeff Pidgeon as Green Aliens.With recognisable toys for every generation, and the Oscar and Golden Globe nominated song ""You've Got a Friend"" and Oscar nominated music by Randy Newman, this is a great family film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and a Special Achievement Award (fior creation of a feature-length computer-animated film), it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical.

","The first feature length Pixar film and the first feature film to be made entirely in computer animated imagery Toy Story was a milestone in film history. But apart from it's massive impact, Toy Story is still a really great film. The toys in the bedroom of Andy Davis (John Morris) are alive (when Andy doesn't look) and seem to have their own community set up. The most popular toy being Andy's favorite toy, a toy cowboy named Woody (Tom Hanks). But that might change this birthday when Andy get's a new toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) a toy spaceman who still thinks that he's a real spaceman. To add on to that Woody takes an immediate disliking to Buzz because Andy seems to play with him more now and all the other toys go the same route. Well Woody and Buzz inadvertently end up in the house of Sid Phillips (Erik Von Detten) the destructive next door neighbor who is pretty much the type of person that would put a turtle on it's shell for fun. So Woody and Buzz have to overcome their differences and get back to Andy's house before he moves. This film's story is great and intriguing. The comedy here is also great. The dialog between Woody and Buzz is very funny. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. It's the birthplace of Pixar who over the years have proved themselves worthy of the praise given by adults and children alike."

","I see that my previous comment on this film was deleted.<br/><br/>This is the thing that started it all: Pixar. Somewhat photorealistic modeling. Deep, deep attention to story dynamics. An animated feature not so polished since ""Snow White."" Something worthy. Something that led to the reinvention of Disney.<br/><br/>Its an iconic turning point, like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""2001,"" ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" Greenaway's ""Tempest."" (and others) Many things after change. <br/><br/>So it should be seen on its historical basis alone. Here already you can see that Pixar decides to combine goals. They want the movie to be just as good as the best non- animated movie. There is the well-documented attention to refining and refining the story dynamics so that the narrative spine simply works. That took years. <br/><br/>What I mean by combined goals is that they also realized that they were presenting something relatively new in their three D modeling capability. So they wanted to have that new cinematic vocabulary enhance the narrative dynamics and vice versa. It is subtle here, not fully developed until ""Nemo."" But its plain to see when pointed out: the camera simply moves in ways that a real one does not. There are a broader set of intimate and distanced observer perspectives. These are not overused, lest you notice them, but you can see that out tolerance and viewing skill has slowly evolved from this to the later Pixar projects. (At this writing, that is ""Wall-E."") <br/><br/>The business about family and desired roles are not ""the point"" as some would say, but strategies to explore this deeper narrative power.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","Toy Story was the first fully animated movie that released in 1995. Starring Tom Hanks as Woody who brings life to the cowboy pull- string doll. Buzz Lightyear, played by Tim Allen brought the right attitude for the newest addition to Andy's (John Morris) toy collection. The story takes us back to the day where we played with toys and used our imaginations to create our own stories. When Andy would leave the room the toys would come to life. A week before Andy's birthday, with his family moving, he is given a party to spend with friends before they leave. The toys plot a way to discover Andy's new presents. After the party the other toys discovered Buzz is one of the presents Andy's receives before he leaves. The main theme of the story to me is ""friendship."" It's a great story relaying the message to be kind to everyone because you never really know when you might need them and your enemy could be your best friend in the end. After all, ""You've got a friend in me.""<br/><br/>Woody doesn't want to lose top spot as favorite toy so he plots to get rid of Buzz. He starts with a master plan that leaves the both of them in a situation to help each other to get home. The rich colors and 3D animation gives the movie a more realistic feeling as if it were drawn. It is the lighting, modeling, computer graphics and animations are what bring this movie to life. The shading of certain objects, cracks or spills could be the difference between a human look or manufactured. The lighting had to be hard to create the film. They had some dramatic moody lights in Sid's room, flashlight stuff, daylight, bright sun for all sorts of different kinds of environments.<br/><br/>When they add light it gives more a visual interest for viewers and hide some flaw in animation. Andy's room gives a sense of a happy, friendly and safe place because the brightness in the room gives that affect. This is an overall great film introducing a new way of animations!"

The problems and dilemmas that the characters experience, are so good, that it may sound a little too complex to a kid's movie, the fact that buzz can't be real astronaut and that he has to settle with being just a toy is just brilliant, and like I said before, uncommonly intelligent. And also the situation where Woody has to prove his ""Ex-friends"" that he didn't kill Buzz, that is for me what makes this film different than any other animated film (""UP"" also has an intelligent plot, but the execution is not as good as this one).<br/><br/>Verdict: Magical, touching, and quite brilliant, ""Toy Story"" is a lot of fun."

","It's amazing how this movie has changed over the years. How the once amazing graphics have aged and really don't hold up is the obvious thing but there's more than that.<br/><br/>When I was younger, Sid was just the monster next door but watching it now I can't help but notice how the movie is (inadvertently) commenting on the impact parents have on their children. Andy's mom always being there, loving and supporting while Sid is literally blowing things up and his dad just sleeps in his recliner in a tucked away room.<br/><br/>Then there's Woody, the cowboy that made us all fall in love with Pixar. To see him now... Woody is a jerk. He's self involved, selfish and even violent all because he's no longer the favorite.<br/><br/>But that is the brilliance of Pixar. 19 years later, the visuals may have waned but the story complexities have matured like a fine wine proving that they have always understood how to make movies for children and adults alike."

","Toy Story is such a great film. It holds up nearly 25 years later and was the first CGI movie ever made and was a rather impressive way to begin CGI movies.<br/><br/>The story is where a kid named Andy that has a bunch of toys that come to life when he is not around. His favorite doll Woody (played by Tom Hanks) is pretty much the leader of all the toys and is later replaced when it's Andy's birthday and gets a spaceman action figure, Buzz Lightyear (played by Tim Allen). Woody gets jealous and accidentally knocks Buzz out of the house. Woody tries to rescue him, and they end up in the next door neighbor's house, and are on the edge of being tortured by a vile kid named Sid. Woody and Buzz must escape the clutches of Sid and make it back to Andy before Andy moves to a new house.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is very well constructed, and the pacing went great for an hour and 20 mins.<br/><br/>The animation, for not only 1995, but for a first ever CGI flick, is very impressive. Of course, the animation does improve later on in further years.<br/><br/>The voice cast was outstanding. People like Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger, Wallace Shawn, Annie Potts, and even Jim Varney all do wonderful jobs at voicing their characters and they were very good choices as well.<br/><br/>All in all, Toy Story is such a great childhood movie and is one of the best Pixar movies ever."

Everything from having ""Andy"" written on the toy's boots, to the menace that was Sid the next door neighbor, to Randy Newman's transformative music, to the bond that was formed between Buzz and Woody, Toy Story is a magical time at the movies.<br/><br/>10/10"

"bankofmarquis","10","1","1","16 December 2018"," Truly a classic
","With Toy Story 4 coming out in theaters this summer, I thought I'd go back and check out a beloved classice - the original TOY STORY (1995) to see if this film holds up to my memory of it.<br/><br/>It sure does.<br/><br/>Directed by visionary Pixar founder John Lasseter, TOY STORY is the first computer generated full-length motion picture and tells the...story...of toys that come to life when the humans leave the room. It is a simple concept that is executed beautifully with wit, charm and heart that sustains to this day and (I would imagine) to infinity...and beyond.<br/><br/>Besides the revolutionary CGI work (which mostly holds up), the heartwarming story and the crispness of the pacing of the film, the masterstroke here is the pitch perfect voice casting. Tom Hanks was the first - and only - choice for Woody, the Cowboy doll that has been the main toy for Andy. His confidence is shattered when Andy receives a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday and he struggles to maintain control of the room - and Andy's heart. In lesser hands, this character could be be annoying and a bit of a jerk, but with Hanks' inherent charm, Woody is lovable, neurotic and vulnerable as he tries to get out of one jam after another.<br/><br/>Tim Allen wasn't the first choice for the voice of Buzz Lightyear, but with his success in 1994's THE SANTA CLAUS he was called into service on this film - and the results couldn't be better. He blends machismo, bluster and a sincere earnestness that perfectly pairs and counterbalances Hanks' tics to form a movie duo that ranks right up there with the best in film history.<br/><br/>It is the attention to detail that these filmmakers really excel at and the supporting cast of voice actors really brings it here. From Don Rickles to John Ratzenberger to Annie Potts to R. Lee Emery to Jim Varney to Laurie Metcalf, all bring charm and heart to their characters even when they are in conflict.<br/><br/>Speaking of attention to detail, the CGI in this film works really, really well - even after 23 years of improvements. The filmmakers were blazing a trail and there is much to look at in the background, from the 2 ""Hidden Mickey's"" in Andy's room to the tribute to THE SHINING, the background and renderings are lush and are worth a viewing just to look at hidden gems (and Easter Eggs) in the background.<br/><br/>But none of this would matter if the story wasn't any good and I give story writers Lasseter and future Pixar Director's Pete Docter and Andrew Stanton credit for keeping the story crisp, clear and simple and infusing heart and sincerity without getting cloying or annoying. Interestingly enough, in looking at the credits, Joss Whedon, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow were all contributors to the screenplay as well. When I see that many writers on a screenplay, I worry about continuity and flow. But, make no mistake about it, this film has a strong vision driven by Lasseter and the results on the screen show that focus.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film in awhile, give yourself a treat and check it out again, it holds up very, very well and will be well worth the 84 minutes it will take to watch it (the shortest of all PIXAR films).<br/><br/>Letter Grade A+ - which means, of course...<br/><br/>A rare 10 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

"Vartiainen","Null","1","1","20 February 2018"," Cornerstone cinema
","In many ways Toy Story is just as big of a film as Snow White, or My Neighbor Totoro. It is the first of its kind, really. The very first feature-length computer-animated film and the founding stone of Pixar Studios. And quite like Snow White, it is still a marvelous film. With certain, minor caveats.<br/><br/>First the praise. The story is still incredible. It has to be for the film to have withstood the test of time so well. It is about toys coming to life when humans are away at least partly because toys were much easier to animate than real humans (the humans in this film look scary, by the way), but great storytelling is often inspired by limitations. And that certainly applies here. Through simple childhood toys we explore the concepts of growing up, learning new things, meeting new people, dealing with failed expectations, fear of loss, abandonment and betrayal, letting go of things, and most importantly, about friendship and family. And it's all told through a fetching, relatable and kid-friendly narrative.<br/><br/>The characters are also a lot of fun, though as a kid I never realized what a jerk Woody (Tom Hanks) really is. Sure, that's his point, but I always though that the cowboy had something of a point. Perhaps kids see these things differently. And nevertheless, the idea that Woody was in the wrong was clear even back then.<br/><br/>Unfortunately what hasn't aged so well is the animation. The humans look terrible, yes, but that was clear even in 1995. But the toys were phenomenal back then. Mindblowing, quite frankly. Less so today. The movement is still really smooth and the designs are interesting, but it all looks so plasticky. The movie works around that admirably - most of the characters are made of plastic, after all - but it still leaves the movie looking flat and lifeless even when it's not supposed to look like it. I've heard it said that early hand-drawn animation looks charmingly simple, whereas early computer-animation simply looks cheap. And there's some truth to that, I'm afraid to tell.<br/><br/>Still, Toy Story is a classic. Not my favourite Pixar film by far, but it did start something quite wonderful."
"stormhawk2019","9","1","1","24 July 2017"," To the infinity and beyond!!
","Pixar's first major smash hit and one of the first entirely computer animated films may not have aged well, considering the huge steps CGI characters have taken since 1995. Its biggest assets, a huge beating heart and a great sense of humor, still work so many years later and let you forget about the sometimes flat textures. The story, the characters and the jokes are what draws you into the story and soon after you forget you're actually watching an adventure about living toys. The great voice acting helps too, of course. The result, a glorious collection of exciting and fun action scenes, is so perfect, you sometimes feel the urge to clap applause in responds to the events on the screen. The voice cast of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen fit the characters of Woody and Buzz so perfectly, this film should be seen as a major highlight in their careers. From Pizza Planet, to Sid's House and the race for the moving truck, this film features plenty of memorable scenes and locations. Randy Newman's song ""You've Got A Friend In Me"" is undeniably one of the best songs to be featured in a Pixar film, shame it didn't win the Oscar for 'Best Original Song' that it deserved. A classic.<br/><br/>PS: Steve Jobs personally funded Pixar to make this film possible. So those who grew up with this film, remember this is another reason on how Jobs changed the world."

The soul ingredient of the story is simply what happens when your toys are left alone and the benefits (and downfalls) of being a toy. But what amazes me the most is the emotional connection that it gives to anyone at any age and what keeps it together is the friendship between toys, even though they are only toys, the movie easily grasps the emotions of 2 people turned into best friends.<br/><br/>Of course sometime in the future another animated movie will have the same success or more than Toy Story and may even beat it.

"Desertman84","10","1","1","19 October 2012"," Toy Story Reinvigorates Movie Animation
","Toy Story is a computer animated comedy produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures.It was the first feature length computer animated film and the first film produced by Pixar. Toy Story follows a group of anthropomorphic toys who pretend to be lifeless whenever humans are present, and focuses on Woody, a pullstring cowboy doll, and Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut action figure . Woody feels profoundly threatened and jealous when Buzz supplants him as the top toy in the room. The film was written and directed by John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow, and Joss Whedon, and featured music by Randy Newman. <br/><br/>The star of the proceedings is Woody, a pull-string cowboy toy belonging to a wide-eyed youngster named Andy. Whenever Andy's out of the room, Woody revels in his status as the boy's number one toy. His supremacy is challenged by a high-tech, space-ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear, who, unlike Woody and his pals, believes that he is real and not merely a plaything. The rivalry between Woody and Buzz hilariously intensifies during the first half of the film, but when the well-being of Andy's toys is threatened by a nasty next-door neighbor kid named Sid whose idea of fun is feeding stuffed dolls to his snarling dog and reconstructing his own toys into hideous mutants such as Woody and Buzz join forces to save the day. <br/><br/>There is greatness in film that can be discussed, dissected, and talked about late into the night. Then there is genius that is right in front of our faces--we smile at the spell it puts us into and are refreshed, and nary a word needs to be spoken. This kind of entertainment is what they used to call ""movie magic,"" and there is loads of it in this irresistible computer animation feature. Just a picture of these bright toys reawaken the kid in us. Filmmaker John Lasseter thinks of himself as a storyteller first and an animator second, much like another film innovator, Walt Disney.<br/><br/>Lasseter's story is universal and magical: what do toys do when they're not played with? He further scores with perfect voice casting that includes Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz,Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head and Wallace Shawn as a meek dinosaur. As entertaining as it is innovative, it kicked off Pixar's unprecedented run of quality pictures, reinvigorating animated film in the process."

","Toy Story was PIXAR's first full-length movie and is still today regarded as one of their best along with the two sequels. The movie is about toys coming to life when the children aren't around. The movie shows how every toy wants to be loved. The main character, Woody (a cowboy), is the most loved toy in Andy's house until another toy, Buzz Light (space ranger), is bought. The story is about their jealousy and friendship; which is portrayed brilliantly in the plot which is aided by an amazing Randy Newman soundtrack. The movie is clever, funny, sad and beautiful in the way that it engrosses all age groups. It was a milestone in animation with its stunning 3-D graphics. I strongly recommend this movie to anybody who hasn't seen it. It is one of PIXAR's and Disney's greatest movies ever and is very worthy of a 10 out of 10."
"hitchcockthelegend","9","1","1","14 July 2012"," As Buzz falls with style, we fall wholesale for this animated classic.
","Toy Story is directed by John Lasseter who also co-writes the story with a whole host of other people! It features the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Annie Potts, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger and Laurie Metcalfe. Music is by Randy Newman.<br/><br/>The first feature-length film animated entirely by computer, there's not a lot that can be said now that hasn't been said before about Toy Story, both as a film of heart and substance, and as regards its importance in the world of animation. Two further sequels would follow, both enormously successful and both equally as enjoyable. But it began here in 95, where Woody, Buzz and the gang operated on a level that beguiled the children whilst simultaneously bringing knowing laughs to the accompanying adults. Pixar paint a vivid colourful world, bringing us down to the toys level and etching in emotive threads about jealousies, friendships, neuroses' and the relationship between a child and his toys, while youthful splendour bathes the film constantly. Even though the plot is simple in terms of ambition, the characterisations are substantial and the film never panders to political correctness. The voice work of the actors is terrific, especially Hanks and Allen as Woody and Buzz respectively, their vocal comedy ticks wonderfully bring life to the animated figures, while Newman adds his optimistic tunes into the mix.<br/><br/>Never maudlin or cheesy with its messages and sombre moments (something some other Disney films can't lay claim too), Toy Story's only crime is being too short at an hour and fifteen minutes (both subsequent sequels would rectify this issue). But it's a small complaint, probably (in my case) born out by greed for a longer adventure involving these marvellous creations. This was the start of a beautiful friendship for many, up there on the screen, and here in our own lives, thank you Pixar, you knocked it out of the park with this one, a film for all that keeps on giving delights with each subsequent revisit. 9.5/10"

Jim Varney even lends his hilarious voice as Slinky the Dog. The story is about a boy (Andy) that gets a new toy (Buzz Lightyear) for his birthday. Andy's previous favorite toy (Woody) feels forgotten. After a series of mis-adventures the two find themselves away from the home and must learn to work together to find their way back. The film is followed by a sequel ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Toy Story 3"" which were just as awesome, if not more so than this one.<br/><br/>9/10 easily"
"ElMaruecan82","10","1","1","11 January 2012"," A Three-Dimensional Masterpiece with a Special Effect in our Hearts :
","Almost 20 years have passed since the nineties Â… Now, we are so familiar with the cell- phones, Facebook and the Internet that we're totally amnesic regarding these years where we had none, and we all scratch our heads wondering how communication was even possible back then. Not too surprisingly, the same reasoning can be applied for animation: we're so used to CGI and 3D animated films that we forgot how groundbreaking Walt Disney's ""Toy Story"" was in 1995, and that we witnessed an event as historical as the release of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". It's not surprising, by the way, that the two films are the only animated features included in the American Film Institute's Top 100 List.<br/><br/>The comparison with ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" doesn't only rely on the technical achievement and the critical recognition, but also on what drove these two crucial aspects: an endearing and universally appealing story. ""Snow White"" exploited all the comical possibilities of the dwarfs, in order to use physically distinct characters with different personalities attributed to each of them, while the Queen and Snow White could be modeled in more realistic designs; the setting also allowed the drawers to extend their talents and give it the touch of magic and escapism the audiences needed back then. ""Toy Story"" does the exact same thing, it chooses the best setting that can justify a clever and playful use of three-dimensionality, by creating a sort of underworld made of different forms and colors, a world where toys come to life when the owner is absent. This choice is a strike of genius because it provides an escapist value in our own environment, Disney made enough movies set in forests, mountains, jungles, so for its first 3D film, we have the first in-door Disney film, which gives an irresistible feeling of intimacy.<br/><br/>This simplicity is the perfect counterpart to the complexity of special effects and the creativity of the screenplay because it also succeeds to add a little touch of nostalgia and hit a sensitive chord by waking the inner child inside of us. In 1995, we're in the midst of Disney Renaissance and its streak of successful films was so full of adventures and romance, thrills and laughs that ""Toy Story"" almost resonates as a comeback to the roots of the Walt Disney Company, childhood. Haven't we all played with toys when we were kids, whether they were dolls, Smurfs figurines, cars, monsters, haven't we all used our hands, totally invisible for our little eyes, and talked instead of characters, like magical puppeteers, imagining them sliding from a ravine that was our bathtub, or escalating a mountain, the bed-pillow. Toys were always alive for us, because our games were precisely what brought them to life, and in ""Toy Story"", we always have the feeling that the creators are less 'making a film' than playing with toys like we used to do, engaging a tacit complicity with the kids in the audience, and the inner kids within the adults from the audience.<br/><br/>""Toy Story"" assumes that toys are alive, and the script is so well written that we're immediately convinced. There's no way Woody, the cowboy doll with Tom Hanks' voice couldn't be alive, that the cocky Buzz Lightyear is only a 3D talking image, that Mr. Potato Head isn't that grouchy figurine or that the Tyrannosaurus isn't that cute and<br/><br/>coward creature, all the toys that belong to little Andy incarnate Disney's magical power, bringing things to life, and we realize how we all had a Disney inside us when we were playing with our toys. And ""Toy Story"" couldn't have a more appropriate villain than a kid who destroyed toys, Sid: a character I despised so much because I was definitely not a Sid when I was younger. ""Toy Story"" is an odyssey in the world of toys after which we don't look at them the same way, calling them objects is almost insulting. Indeed, I've always felt guilty because as a teen, my mother told me to get rid of my toys, to give them to needier boys, and although I didn't play with them anymore, I remember how painful it was to say them goodbye, after ""Toy Story"", now I feel better with myself.<br/><br/>And ""Toy Story"" doesn't just take its creativity and the cuteness of its characters for granted, there are the lines, the humor, but the story too, starting with the antagonism between the two 'lead' toys. Woody is jealous because Buzz, Andy's new birthday gift, became his best friend, in other words, his favorite toy, while Buzz doesn't know he's only a toy and lives in total denial about his true nature, which adds an unexpected bit of poignancy to characters that are not just three-dimensional on a geometrical level. The film has its share of action, mostly with the Buzz and Woody's duo trying to get back to Andy's house before the family moves in, but the emotional core of the film is their friendship. And progressively, their journey will allow them to understand the value of a toy, illustrated by Newman's Oscar-nominated song ""You've Got a Friend in Me""; there would still be room for Woody in Andy's heart and there's an inner nobility in toys in the way they bring happiness during our most treasured memories.<br/><br/>'Toy Story"" is a beautiful friendship story between two lovable toys, (have you noticed that Buzz and Woody makes buddy if you associate them), whose friendship culminate at the moment where both 'fall with style' in Andy's box. And I guess this is why we hardly remember how groundbreaking ""Toy Story"" was, maybe we just forgot about the special effects and the whole 3D thing, and simply remember the beauty of the story."

","The visuals don't look as polished as you may have come to expect, so it's a testament to the quality of writing that this movie is still as good today as it was sixteen years ago. I can't undersell the ingenuity of the filmmaking either, as Pixar does more with limited technology and a thin rule book than most CGI artists can manage today. Careful, artistic shot selection and playful direction really do a lot to compensate for the occasional bad render, and a world-class cast of voice actors takes care of the rest. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen deserve every bit of recognition they get for their roles as Woody and Buzz; they really put the film on their shoulders and carry it right over the top, shifting something that would've probably been pretty good in other hands into a raging success story."
"nickmesafilms","10","1","1","9 July 2011"," Toy Story (1995) - My Toys are Talking!
","Disney-PIXAR's first ever CGI-animated movie ""Toy Story"" is one of the best animated movies I have seen in years. The movie brings smart ideas, charming heart, and loving characters including Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the gang of toys. The movie begins with Woody, a cowboy toy, who used to be the star of the toy chest, until this new toy arrives after the owner's birthday, named Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger toy, with beliefs that he's a real space ranger. This leads into fr-enemy rivalry involving these two toys, until they learn the true meaning of friendship. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provide the voices for these well-known characters, and they did a great job of bringing talking toys to life. I thought the movie was excellent at writing some kind of every day diary through the eyes of toys. I think Pixar knows how to push the envelope with great ideas of animation, and they started this success with ""Toy Story"". I thought the movie is excellent in every way, it never leaves a single heart, and we grow up watching this movie and we never get tired of watching the old-fashioned buddy pictures, which made ""Toy Story"" a big success to critics and the box office. I really enjoy watching this movie over and over, and it always takes me back to my childhood. ""Toy Story"", in my review, ""brilliant in every way, and always a loving memory""."

"TomL123","10","1","1","29 June 2011"," The pioneer of animation movies.
","This was the movie that started it all for the world of animation. This was the pioneer. Now we all know that when we see a pixar movie ( especially one with the likes of john lassetter involved in it) that we are in for a cinematic experience.<br/><br/>This movie fulfills every child's dream. Haven't you ever wondered what your toys do when you aren't there. I know I did when I was a kid, I myself had a buzz lightyear doll and I always imagined him having that Tim Allen voice.<br/><br/>not only does it fulfill the child's dream, but there is a ton of easter eggs that pixar has included that will keep the teenagers and adults interested and laughing as well. Even 16 years after the original release date I still watch the movie and I am still finding little subliminal messages (easter eggs) that pixar has included.<br/><br/>Disney/ pixar headed by john lassetter do a great job in making an unbelievable movie seem as believable as possible. Just for a second forget that these are toys we are talking about here and imagine that they are real people. Would they have acted any different to how they did? Knowing that what the characters did and how they reacted and how it is on unreasonable to consider that they might act that way is the key to good script writing and good storytelling. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen also do a marvellous job at heading the cast making every line seem funnier or more dramatic than it actually is.<br/><br/>Overall i would not just recommend this, this is a MUST SEE for any kid or adult.

"StevePulaski","10","1","1","22 April 2011"," Go above and beyond and you achieve greatness
","Toy Story was the first entirely computer animated film in its time of release in 1995, and it puts Pixar on the map for a generation of amazingly crafted films to be made. The attention to detail is exquisite in this picture as reflections, flexibilities, and movement are all captured in such a stunning format it's almost too much to comprehend. Everything moves so fluently, is crafted with such a broad mind it's still astonishing to this date.<br/><br/>CGI animation is made with wondrous creativity and the possibilities to show off it's style are virtually unlimited. Though when companies in 2011 make kids movies like these they forget about the storyline and just make the film loud and colorful to attract the youth's attention. Not Pixar. Pixar is so much smarter. They understand good animation and a great storyline with characters. Show me a Pixar movie that isn't at least above average and I'll show you a car that can you can drive with no wheels.<br/><br/>But CGI animation has it's downsides. Being released in 1995, Toy Story was the first computer animated film. Meaning other companies were racing their technology where everyone wanted to take advantage of the CGI craze. The main company in this heated competition was DreamWorks Animation Studios. Their first feature film was Antz, notable for being almost a direct knockoff of Pixar's A Bug's Life which came out the same year (1998). Following Antz came others like Chicken Run and The Road to El Dorado. Still none of which lived up to Toy Story's caliber.<br/><br/>DreamWorks scored big when releasing Shrek in 2001. It definitely put them on the map of animation companies, and it's surely remembered more than Chicken Run. But still, while Shrek had a more rapid fire sequel release schedule than Toy Story, none of which had the same heart, message, or love any of these films had.<br/><br/>One last downside is that CGI, no matter which way you look at it, killed hand drawn animation. Generations of kids now likely will never get to experience the classic animation like they should. If they do they will most likely hate it after being exposed to all the glossy and more stylish animation that is among us today. But shows like Beavis and Butthead and The Simpsons are just as good.<br/><br/>Enough with the animation history, lets talk about the film. I doubt anyone will disagree with me, that this is one of the greatest animated films of all time. It combines clever antics with loving characters you become attached to. It's funny to think toys have a mind of their own. Plus all the trouble they would experience if they were alive.<br/><br/>Andy (Morris) is a typical child. He has a number of toys of different varieties and enjoys making up little adventures the figures can go on. All ranging from a Mr. Potato Head, a cowboy doll, a toy piggy bank, and others. Woody (Hanks), a cowboy doll, who now feels threatened when a flashy, gadget filled toy named Buzz Lightyear (Allen) is given to Andy for his birthday. Buzz impresses the entire gang of toys much to the dismay and fear of Woody that he will become another forgotten toy.<br/><br/>Simple premise. Giant execution. It's everything and more. In the nineties, this animation was simply groundbreaking. Because this was the first film made by Pixar, the standard hadn't been set yet. But it was clear after Toy Story that animation would be forever changed for more than one reason.<br/><br/>Starring: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Annie Potts, John Morris, Laurie Metcalf, and Erik von Detten. Directed by: John Lasseter."

"TOMNEL","10","1","1","11 March 2011"," PIXAR set the very high bar here for CGI films, and have been hovering around or above it since.
","PIXAR is a brand that is now synonymous with quality, and it's not hard to see why this is. They have consistently made wonderful animated pictures that are very funny and heartwarming, and all have memorable and soon to be iconic scenes. They never pander to children, nor do they rely on cheap gags or melodrama. This film is the epitome of what PIXAR is about. ""Toy Story"" is one of the greatest animated films, that in recent years has only been topped by a few other PIXAR films.<br/><br/>In the world this film sets up, toys are all alive, though they don't let that known to people. They play their roles are toys and when the people are not in sight, they talk about their job of being played with, and their personal lives. It's Andy's birthday, and all the toys in his room are worried about this fate with new toys coming in. Woody the cowboy doll is the leader of the group and is Andy's favorite toy, but Andy just received a new space toy, Buzz Lightyear, and now Woody is playing second fiddle and he doesn't like that. After mistakenly knocking Buzz out the window, the toys turn on Woody and he and Buzz end up on an adventure trying to find Andy and make it back to his house before he and his family move.<br/><br/>The characters are always walking a fine line here, and never once do they fall off into one side. Woody could be very unlikable. He's always complaining, shouting all the time and he does some pretty mean things. Woody may be occasionally ill intentioned, but he is never malicious, and instead of being a complete jerk, he is often fighting between what is right and wrong and picks the former. The characters can be mean, but they're well intentioned in the end, and it's what shows in them. <br/><br/>This film is of course a technical achievement, boasting that it's the first feature length fully computer animated movie. The animation looks great still today, but in a film world dominated by special effects and computer animation, it's very difficult to impress, but what still stands out about this film's look is it's visual style. From strange mid 50s interior designs to the atmospheric and beautiful golden hour look of certain scenes, this movie has such unique sets and shadows and just the atmosphere overall is very involving. The exciting chase and action sequences are also remembered and still today look dazzling. But what makes those scenes, namely the whole moving van sequence at the end, is the emotion. You feel for these characters, and the ""Falling with style"" callback that could feel contrived and corny, comes off as heartwarming. All the great scenes in the film have a level of humanity underneath all the negativity and cynicism of Woody that makes this animated toy feel very human.<br/><br/>Randy Newman can be a little samey in some of his musical work, but his songs and score work very well here. The songs give us insight into what the character is feeling, and raise the emotion. His score plays off really well, and is catchy and bouncy without being cheesy. You'll find yourself singing these songs and humming the music after watching this.<br/><br/>Toy Story is animated masterpiece. Unlike many of Disney animation's masterpieces, like the wonderful ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Little Mermaid"", this plays as a film instead of a great animated movie. It's a timeless film that will surely entertain many generations to come. It's a true classic!<br/><br/>My rating: **** out of ****. 81 mins. Rated G."

","This movie is just awesome! Bearing in mind that this was a film from 1994/95, the quality of the realistic 3D animation is stunning and what a perfect way to start a new era! Just as a new form of animation comes to life, a vast number of toys magically come to life when their child-owner Andy is out of the room. Maybe that's a true-to-life symbolisation! From the word go, every single one of those toys have become so famous and iconic. Argos (especially), Toys R Us, Amazon, Woolworths and more have never, since the film's 1995-release, been without stock of them! Like it says in the summary, it's a heart-warming story as well as a funny, super-cool movie about a pull-string ragdoll (Woody) whose popularity is short-lived as Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday as a result of new electronic toys hitting the market proving to be better than a just a ragdoll. Understandably, Woody is jealous of Buzz and can't stand his guts. He's an arrogant, self-interested toy but, more than anything else, an total, utter idiot.<br/><br/>All the toys have their own personalities; there's Little Bo Peep who has a soft spot for Woody, Slinky Dog who likes Woody and is very friendly, Rex the world's most IRRITATING dinosaur ever, RC, the RC who revs up and down rather than talks and then there's Mr Potato Head and he is VILE! So, so mean and frequently rude. He seems to have some kind of vendetta against Woody for no reason I can think of. Then, he creates his very own campaign to destroy Woody in order to avenge Buzz when Woody's the one who has felt lonely and unwanted for so long! You'd think it'd put children off the authentic Mr Potato Head by Playskool! Oh yes and there's one more toy I didn't mention - Lenny, the toy-sized pair of binoculars. He was voiced by Joe Ranft who contributed in the story development of ""Toy Story"" and is now sadly no longer on this earth. He was killed when the speed of his car went beyond control, crashed through the wall of a bridge and plunged into the river below. The Pixar team miss him terribly...<br/><br/>JOE RANFT 1960-2005"

","It's only now, fifteen years after its release, that I decided to give TOY STORY a look on my large flat screen TV. I've never been a fan of computer animation per se, but this charming story has heart and wit and enough entertainment value for both young and old. The toy characters are both appealing and very funny in ways that anyone can appreciate, thanks to a clever script.<br/><br/>Woody the Cowboy and Buzz Lightyear compete for the affections of a small boy, Andy, whose playroom is loaded with toys that come alive whenever anyone leaves the bedroom. Out of this fresh idea, the plot bounces along with supreme confidence as it races forward putting all of them in constant danger from their ever changing environment, especially when they leave the confines of Andy's home.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is a marvel--everything simulated through computer wizardry, all of it invented with taste for artistry evident in every frame of the film--the kind of artistry that the Walt Disney studio demonstrated during the heyday of their cartoon wizardry.<br/><br/>The brilliant colors look even more amazing in the good print of the film that aired on cable tonight.

","Toy Story will forever be remembered as the first feature film to be fully animated by computer. Since its debut in 1995, dozens more have joined it, including a sequel (soon to be two sequels as of this writing), as well as several other excellent films from its animation company, Pixar. However, for its unique accomplishment, Toy Story stands alone. It doesn't hurt that even beyond the technical achievement, the film is charming, well-written, and touching.<br/><br/>The toys in question belong to Andy, who has a huge variety of them scattered around his room. The unofficial head toy is Woody, a cowboy toy who has ""been Andy's favorite since kindergarten"". Woody loves being the favored toy, but the order is shaken up when Andy receives a surprise present on his birthday: a Buzz Lightyear action figure, who causes Woody to become jealous when he begins to take over the #1 toy position in Andy's playtime.<br/><br/>There's a lot of good stuff in this film: The animation, which mostly still works 15 years later; the voice acting, which is carried out excellently; the story, which keeps viewers engaged throughout. What gets me most about Toy Story is the way that both Woody and Buzz must grow throughout the movie. Woody has to let go of his jealousy and accept that things change when someone new enters the mix. Buzz has to learn (the hard way) that he really is a toy, but that he has a very important role as such. This is better character development than we see in some ""more mature"" films. It was here that Pixar began a long line of memorable, excellently crafted characters.<br/><br/>Pixar has released ten feature films in the past fifteen years. Toy Story 3 this summer will make eleven. They've maintained a very high standard of quality during that time. It definitely helps that, with Toy Story, they were off to an excellent start."

","I love Toy Story. Plain and simple, it's a phenomenal film. Not only is it one of the most well-made animated films ever made, it's also one of my favorite films in general. It's incredibly appealing story, the voice acting is perfect, the characters are very likable and fun to watch on screen, and the animation is stellar for it's time.<br/><br/>The basic premise of TOY STORY is life seen through the eyes of a toy. The film centers around the toys belonging to a boy named Andy, particularly following his favorite toy, a stuffed cowboy doll named Woody. Woody is primarily the one in charge of Andy's room, but his authority is threatened when Andy gets a new spaceman toy named Buzz Lightyear. The only problem is that Buzz doesn't know he's a toy. He genuinely thinks that he is a real space ranger.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks voices Woody and Tim Allen voices Buzz, and both do a stellar job. I couldn't ever imagine anybody voicing these two characters besides Hanks and Allen. The supporting cast does a wonderful job as well, such as Jim Varney as Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Annie Potts as Bo Peep, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, and others. The characters are so fun to watch, and you truly care about them as you watch Woody and Buzz form a friendship. At it's heart, Toy Story is a buddy movie, and one of the best made at that.<br/><br/>While the animation seems somewhat dated today when compared to PIXAR's more recent films, the film does still look very nice. Looking back at the film, it truly is a technological achievement as well as a film-making achievement in general.<br/><br/>Being the first animated film done entirely through computers, Toy Story had a lot of expectations to meet. And not only does it meet expectations, it surpasses them to infinity and beyond."

Toy Story is about a boy named Andy who, like most of us, had many toys as a kid, but there was always that one special toy that we just played with all the time. For him, it was cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks from ""Big"", ""Apollo 13"", ""Saving Private Ryan"") who feels he'll never be replaced. That all changes on Andy's birthday when he gets a cool spaceman toy, Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen, from the hit 90's sitcom ""Home Improvement"") and all of a sudden, Buzz is his new favorite toy. After ending up stuck in a game machine where ""The Claw"" picks both of them up and a dangerous boy named Sid (voiced by Erik von Detten), has some pretty evil plans for them.

The voice talents aren't the only things worth mentioning, the film has a remarkable story and a truly irreverent script (""I'm from Mattel, actually I'm from a smaller company that was purchased by Mattel in a leveraged buyout""). But the best aspect of the movie is the phenomenal animation, which was colourful and sophisticated with brilliant character movement. Honestly, I loved this movie, and I also thought the sequel is one of the few sequels of recent times, that actually manages to surpass its predecessor. All in all, a wonderful film, that is a must-see for the whole family. 10/10 Bethany Cox."

","Here's another film I watched back-to-back every day for a couple of weeks, when I was younger. I recently picked up the DVD and was instantly pulled in again. I ended up watching it again two days later. Anyway, I must point out that watching it when you're a child and watching it when you're an adult will result in two different experiences. Watching it recently I laughed my arse off at jokes I didn't even know were jokes back then; even simple things like ""Buzz LightBeer"" can have quite an impact.<br/><br/>Alright then, enough of that. The film is 100% perfect the way it is. The characters are so full of personality, so full of humanity, and how it perfectly expresses emotions of loneliness, rejection, and love through a couple of toys is astounding. The movie has a sort of episodic appeal to it, wherein each episode leads to one collective end. It also seems that the worst that can happen to our protagonists does happen. It makes for one unpredictable plot. There's plenty of darkness here, especially with the whole Sid scenario, or when Buzz tries to fly. Did I mention the soundtrack? Randy Newman was perfect for this job; the music has a childish aura to it, but also helps accentuate the emotions of certain scenes. Can't imagine why he wasn't asked to work on the sequel. Anyway, Toy Story has received countless awards, and it is my opinion they are deserved."
"ilikepuppies","9","1","1","19 May 2007"," They Don't Call it ""Playing"" for Nothing.
","The opening scene says it all. Film-making begins in early childhood, as children use their toys to create little scenes (or movies if you will). The word ""play"" when used to describe such activity indeed derived from the movies of another era, plays. Or perhaps the other way around. Either way, the point of this film is to show that creating a film and playing with toys are virtually the same thing.<br/><br/>So the film is basically about itself. A play about playing. This is exactly the type of multi-layered construction that I believe subconsciously challenges and nurtures our kids' minds. Teaching a child (or adult!) to think on more than one level at a time is simply a gift.<br/><br/>It should also be applauded that it's all substance and no fluff. Other animation teams have inundated their films with meaningless pop culture gags, camp, and nostalgic irony. Not to mention an abundance of toilet humor. Music by the great Randy Newman instead of the Village People.<br/><br/>None of the mindless pandering to adults here, either, yet we are included in the fun by being subtly reminded of our own play days. Barrel of Monkeys. Potato Heads. In fact there is a strong undercurrent theme here as the classic cowboy toy is threatened by the flashy new space man who is obviously being pushed on kids via a relentless marketing campaign. We 30-somethings must root for Woody. It's Wal-mart vs. our favorite mom-n-pop corner store.<br/><br/>These Pixar guys are brilliant, and I believe they will be revered someday as perhaps the most important influence in all of filmdom during the turn of this century's period. There is no more sure thing than a Pixar offering. Always compelling, engaging, intelligent and abstract. And this one is the best."

To quote Randy Newman's song from the film, strange things begin to happen to Woody when he loses popularity with the other toys and is accused of trying to kill Buzz out of jealousy.

","PIXAR animation was but an experimental animation company that had a track record of short film contributions to film festivals when Disney invested in and ultimately released their first project,Toy Story. I figured Disney probably had a good feeling about this one,but I'm not sure they anticipated the kind of groundbreaking swell of animation this would shepherd in.<br/><br/>The concept is a fitfully simple and cute one: when kids are away,their toys take on personalities and lives of their own,plotting,planning,bickering,reacting,flirting,etc. In this particular den of toys, a Cowboy Woody doll(voiced by Tom Hanks) is the leader,flanked by a Slinky dog(Jim Varney),green toy soldiers(aptly casted R.Lee Ermey as their platoon leader),a Mr.Potato head(Don Rickles), a Piggy bank(John Ratzenberger,forever Cliff Claven from ""Cheers"") and a Bo Peep doll(Annie Potts). Into the mix is a new,electronic Buzz Lightyear action figure(Tim Allen,who probably does the best voice acting of the bunch here),who almost instantly wows the locals and stirs jealousy from Woody.<br/><br/>With music from Randy Newmann--a personal fave of mine--this movie's colors,attention to detail and wry humor make it easily adaptable to kids and adults alike. CAn it really be ten years since this film broke new ground on animation? How time flies in the wake of stuff like ""Shrek"" and ""FInding Nemo""!"

Kudos to Pixar for an excellent job.<br/><br/>A must-see film, it has something for everyone, and loses nothing on repeated viewing.

I now wish I had seen this movie years ago, instead of waiting for a cheap LD clearance sale.<br/><br/>TS, while adhering to Disney movie traditions, is an entertaining diversion, and historically important as a computer-rendered movie to boot.  The difference between Disney and Pixar sensibilities concerning humor are evident early on; one is thankful that Disney gave so much lee-way to Pixar concerning story and dialogue.  While I can't say that I was as entertained by the goings-on as average Disney fans, I can say that the results are much better than standard Disney fare.  (In fact, if you can find this for under $50 on laserdisc, I can assure that your entertainment dollar is well-spent)<br/><br/>The LD contains the pre-TS Pixar shorts (worth the price of admission) as well as director's comments, and much more.  The LD is probably the best deal I've had in a while, and I recommend that everyone- despite their feelings towards Disney- get this LD set.  I hope that Disney comes out with an equivalent set for DVD users; everyone deserves to have access to this.<br/><br/>An amazing film, seemingly light-years beyond what Disney is capable of.

","Toy Story is a good movie. It has good characters and a decent story. But is it really worth the hype? Yes, it's the first fully computer animated movie ever made and that's very impressive. For that reason alone, it will stand out in history. But I certainly never really thought it was the brilliant classic everyone else thought it was. Its animation is great but the story suffers from major pacing issues. There are entire moments of the movie right in the middle that bore me every time and don't stop boring me until I get to the film's climax, when it picks up again. A lot of trimming should have been done in the middle. Toy Story is good but its sequels are a lot better. So is it bad? No. But it's not brilliant. If this were 2-D, I doubt it would receive this high praise."
"cyberinsekt","6","13","42","3 January 2002"," Cynical and disturbing
","This is one film that left me with a very sour aftertaste.  Yes, it's animated with character and vigour, and there are some fine -- if over the top -- voice performances.  However, there are some very disturbing aspects to the film.  The first is that it's like nothing so much as watching a 90 minute advert.  Even if merchandising hadn't been released to support the film, all the supporting cast could already by bought in your local toy shop.  I'm sure I wasn't the only viewer who found this more than a little suspect.<br/><br/>[Possible spoiler:]<br/><br/>The second, perhaps larger, point against the film lies in the characterisation of the two boys, Andy and Sid.  Andy is the ""good"" boy. He plays safely and passively with his toys, they don't do anything toys wouldn't do.  Sid, the ""bad"" boy is more creative.  He adapts toys to fit his own vision, he's an innovator, a creator.  It's this very creativity of his that is portrayed as a bad thing.  Sid isn't the ideal target audience for this film: he wouldn't be satisfied with row after row of identical shop-bought toys, he would much rather make his own.  I guess this review is being written for all the Sids out there, who are demonised and vilified by this ultra-corporate nightmare of a film."

I liked some of the one liners but there wasn't much point for me in watching this, I didn't enjoy it and knew everything that was going to happen. It also probably didn't help that I am not a fan of Tom Hanks or the Tool Time guy (Tim Allen?) who did the voice of Buzz Lightyear.

","I saw Toy Story in theaters when it first came out and it was alright but I wasn't impressed. Over the years I've come to dislike it rather than feeling neutral toward it. The concept of the movie wasn't new to me because I had already seen the Jim Henson film The Christmas Toy which was basically the same but instead of Woody the cowboy being the main character it was a tiger plush toy named Rigby and I prefer puppetry over CG anyway. Given that this movie was made in the early days of CG the people look really weird and fake, almost creepy, even the good characters. It seems to mainly focus on the petty squabbles between the jealous cowboy and the delusional spaceman. While the film has a few jokes the kids might not get, my over all impression is that the whole story lacks depth. You could maybe read between the lines and infer things but the movie glosses over most of the more serious stuff to keep the mood light. I didn't find any of the characters particularly likable either."

Disney/Pixar computer-generated cartoon has witty writing and incredible visuals to spare, though some scenes are heavy with chatter and the climactic race to catch up to a moving van is stretching things, even for a kid's picture.

"imagiking","7","2","4","8 July 2010"," Toy Story: Thoroughly Entertaining
","With the ever increasing proximity of Toy Story 3, I decided it was about time for me to revisit the original and its first sequel to refresh my memory. Having been among the original target audience, it's a real trip back to childhood.<br/><br/>The longtime favourite toy of young Andy, Woody is disgruntled to be pushed aside in favour of a new space-ranger action figure in the form of Buzz Lightyear. Admired by child and fellow toys alike, Buzz threatens Woody's territory, prompting an effort to remove him which results in the two being left many miles from home, with little time to get back before the family's move.<br/><br/>Now regarded fondly as one of the best kids' movies of all time, Toy Story was the catalyst which allowed Pixar to rapidly ascend to the throne of animation where they dominantly remain to this day. Certainly it wowed me when I first saw it, almost fifteen years ago now. Indulging every child's fantasy that their toys come to life when they're not looking, we find ourselves instantly aligned with the host of strange characters. The quality of the animation, revolutionary for its time, is seen instantly, proudly boasted in the movements of the soldiers as they march downstairs. Everything looks completely realistic and, most importantly, believable. Whilst amusing beforehand, the laughs only really start to build up when Buzz arrives and we are treated to his interactions with Woody, the disagreements between the two and their petty arguments forming the basis of the film's funny factor. The added maturity of years affords the understanding of some of the film's more adult jokes, adding a little something extra to the experience for returning viewers. The action-adventure side of the plot keeps up the drama, tension, and sense of doom, keeping us wondering whether or not the reluctant duo will ever make it back in time. The scenes in Sid's house are the film's best, in terms of keeping up suspense. Their oddness is stand-out and ever memorable, the stranger toys therein encountered doubtlessly having haunted many little 'uns over the years. Certainly still enjoyable, Toy Story remains an inherently good film, though for me it stands less high than the likes of Wall-E, lacking the considerable emotional impact of that later Pixar effort.<br/><br/>Carrying a vast legacy, Toy Story stands the test of time well, still as enjoyable as ever it was. Having paved the way for films which, as you would hope, took what it did and did them better, it is enduring, endearing, and thoroughly entertaining."

","The toys in Andy's bedroom are worried when he gets a new Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger for his birthday. Sheriff Woody is jealous, but when he knocks Buzz out of the window by accident, he must face the outside world and go rescue him.<br/><br/>Toy Story is a World's First movie. The use of computer-generated animation had been pioneered in other films (Tron, The Last Starfighter, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, etc) and had been used extensively in short films (such as Lasseter's classic Luxo Jr., the origin of the Pixar company desklamp logo), but Toy Story is the original computer-rendered animation movie and its visual dynamics are simply stunning. In particular, the generation of movement through the frame (such as the point-of-view shot of Andy running up the stairs) and the ability to perfectly map any number of light sources to the motion of objects are amazing techniques previously unheard of in standard cell-painted animation. Lasseter and his incredible crew of artists have created an animation world which can duplicate almost anything a three-dimensional live-action movie could. It's an incredible achievement. Much more importantly however, it's a great movie - funny, scary, jam-packed full of great characters, and a terrific story. It has two ideas that are just brilliant; firstly, the central conceit of the toys coming to life, and secondly, Buzz struggling to come to terms with his identity. It kinda reminds me of a kids version of Robocop; on the one hand it's a goofy adventure story but on the other it's really almost a philosophical fable about a guy facing the meaninglessness of existence ! I also love the sheer variety of the toys, both visually and character-wise; as well as Andy's toys, Sid's monstrous hybrids are fabulous and the wacko three-eye greenies are hilarious (""Nirvana is coming ! The mystic portal awaits !!""). The voice cast are terrific, particularly Allen, Shawn and Ermey, and the movie sounds just as good as it looks, with excellent sound design by Gary Rydstrom. My one complaint is Randy Newman's song score, which is okay, but I'm afraid his laid-back LA showtunes style grates with me, and does he really need six credits for it ? Anyway, this is a great movie for everybody, kids and adults alike, and a genuine pleasure to watch. See if you can catch the shot they stole from Close Encounters Of The Third Kind."

The movie is also very funny as well as very heartfelt.<br/><br/>So overall the movie does have some iffy animation, but it also has a very natural flow, great characters, great story, great comedic and dramatic moments, and it's overall a very satisfying film. It still really holds up 25 years later. It's a 92%"

","Hu Di has low self-esteem, jealousy and no sense of security. He always comforts himself. He is Andy's favorite toy. In fact, he worries about others replacing him all the time. At last, he admitted that bath Lightyear was cool, he admitted that he was ordinary, and finally he could face up to himself. Ordinary is not terrible. What's terrible is not to accept your ordinary. Buzz Lightyear always thought he was a space trooper and a superhero. A TV advertisement broke his dream and let him hit the wall of reality. Cowboys and astronauts, civilians and heroes, have different identities and different positions, but the transformation of re understanding themselves is the same. The first growth is from ambition to reality; the second growth is to learn to pursue dreams after being down-to-earth. The most common Hu Di can also unite all toys, scare away the villains and save Buzz Lightyear; Buzz Lightyear, who can't fly, actually soars in the sky and fulfills his dream of flying. The most touching moment is not the great achievements of heroes, but the highlight of the little ones."

Hudi was left out, so he was jealous and jealous, and he planned to drive Buzz Lightyear away.<br/><br/>Later, due to yin and yang, Hu Di and Buzz Lightyear both went to the outside world, and were taken away by a child who likes to abuse toys, so they went together and escaped to the little master.<br/><br/>At first, Hu Di was very selfish, because jealousy repeatedly targeted Buzz Lightyear, and later because of his shame, after finding out that Buzz Lightyear did not die, he was eager to bring Buzz Lightyear back to show his innocence to everyone, so Both yin and yang were caught by the neighbor's children, and their feelings gradually increased during the attempt to escape, and they gradually became good friends.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that the proud Buzz Lightyear has always firmly believed that he is a space mount police and can fly, and his mission is to protect the universe, but when he realizes that he is really just a toy as Hu Di said, and is trying Flying but broke his arm fiercely. This slow motion and soundtrack, as well as the main perspective of Buzz Lightyear's fall in the sky, the window that symbolizes the hope of freedom, is close but out of reach, he The heart is frustrated and desperate. After going through this, he seemed to be a different person, gave up his pride, no longer wanted to escape, and even renounced himself.<br/><br/>Seeing this, I cried. There are many moments in our life. We will suddenly find ourselves not a hero, but a person who is as ordinary as the rest of the world and can no longer be ordinary. Of yourself.<br/><br/>I really like what Hu Di said when he comforted Buzz Lightyear, ""Being a toy is much better than being a Space Mounted Police. In that house, a kid thinks you are the best, not because you are a space rider Police, just because you are his toy. ""Yes, even if you are insignificant, you always have your own value, and some people regard you as his most important existence. Some people care and are confirmed by others.

","Toy Story is, for me, the animated film of my childhood. While some people might say that they grew up watching The Lion King, Aladdin, or Beauty and the Beast, I clearly remember watching Toy Story on repeat at every chance I got.<br/><br/>Having said that, it had been a while since I'd seen the film, but I was so happy watching it again. I remembered all of the little details which were about to happen before they did, but that didn't make the film predictable. It made it more special, remembering which bits I used to laugh at with my dad, back in the day.<br/><br/>Pixar eventually became known for creating animated films which contained an extremely deep message, but this was their first one out of the gate and I picked up on a lot more of these meanings upon rewatch.<br/><br/>Underneath the animation is a wonderfully profound story about losing your way in life and realising who you are actually meant to be. There are also references to depression, and it's all handled in an extremely effective way because it contains these deep themes which adults can reflect upon whilst also having an incredibly entertaining story which kids can enjoy.<br/><br/>I don't think the film is perfect because it only stretches for about 75 minutes and the pacing can be a little wonky at times, but the pros of the film outweigh the cons by a mile and this is still one of Pixar's best movies to date. The last fifteen minutes is also one of the best quarter of an hours that I have ever seen in an animated film, as it's full of tension, excitement, and emotion.

","Toy Story became one of 1995's surprise hits after a troubled production that saw Woody's character go through a complete overhaul: he went from being a controlling jerk (there's a Black Friday Reel on YouTube that shows what could have been) to a wise leader who watches out for his friends and only gets shaken up when a new toy, Buzz Lightyear, is changing his world that shakes his place and stability amongst Andy's collection of toys. It's a simple story of protagonist-confronted-by-inciting-incident 'stuff' but this simplicity and true-to-their-heart cast of characters makes Toy Story such a great film that takes full advantage of its creative and multi-layered world.<br/><br/>It's one of the world's defining animated movies thanks to its full-circle screenplay and top-notch character development never being squandered during the film's (admittedly) short runtime of 81 minutes.

Everything about the original film from Pixar is perfect, genius and completely engaging and entertaining. What other animated flick references the likes of films such as 'The Shining', 'Star Wars', 'Alien' or 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'? This film encompasses so many wonderful things about growing up. Birthday parties with your friends, spontaneous trips to eat pizza and play arcade games, Christmas with the family and, of course, the thrill of imagining up an incredible world in which you and your toys can live and interact. Toy Story's characters are amazing, its animation was (and still is) stunning and its themes of friendship, loyalty and learning to get along with those around you make it a film in which both children and adults can both relate to and learn from."

","Toy Story was directed by John Lasseter, screenplay by Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow. And starring Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger.<br/><br/>And it's about Woody, a traditional pull-string talking cowboy, has long enjoyed a place of honor as the favorite among six-year-old Andy's menagerie of toys. Quick to calm their anxieties about being replaced by newer arrivals, Woody finds his own confidence shaken, and his status as top toy in jeopardy, upon the arrival of Buzz Lightyear, simply the coolest space action figure ever made. Woody plots to get rid of Buzz, but things backfire and he finds himself lost in the outside world with Buzz as his only companion.<br/><br/>I think we all agree that Toy Story saga is the best animated franchise ever made! Even after it ended in TS3, TS4 found a way to make the audience really happy. And the original Toy Story is no difference than the rest of the franchise, it started a whole new era of animated movies, TS is the very first CGI animated movie ever made. And guys, as I promised I'm gonna review the first 3 TS movie, starting with the original.<br/><br/>Toy Story is one of the best animated movies ever made, every time I rewatch it, I never felt bored or anything.. even though it has a couple of issues.
Let's start with those issues:<br/><br/>Alright, firstly, how did Buzz freeze every time a human walked by, and he doesn't know that he's a toy yet? I know he said that he adapts to the current environment, but it didn't seem so right.
Also what was he doing under his box, there was nothing but his picture and his job in the galaxy?<br/><br/>Those are my only issues with this movie, everything else was so perfect, starting with the cast:
Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are so memorable as Woody and Buzz Lightyear, I mean it's so hard to think about Woody and Buzz without thinking of Hanks and Allen!
Everyone else was amazing as their characters, but those two did an outstanding job as their characters, they even gave them depth and a way more chemistry!<br/><br/>Also this movie is so quotable, the screenplay has been made perfectly... Also the movie is super funny, for kids and adults, it also had some very good adult humor!
Alongside with the screenplay, the characters gave this movie something more than just words, you feel like they are so real, and it gives every kid a great message about friendship, and accepting the others, no matter how they're different!
And also it gives them something that every single kid hoped to see, their own toys moving and having a life just like humans.<br/><br/>The story is pretty amazing, with an amazing villain that will make you hate him as soon as you see him, it's an amazing adventure to live, with amazing messages during the whole movie.<br/><br/>The animation is still, to this day, timeless, you can watch it after 24 years of its release, and you still can be amazed of how did they do that back at the time!
Also it has a great score, and a song that never left the franchise, you all know which one I mean, yeah, ""you've got a friend in me"".<br/><br/>Toy Story is a great animated movie, with memorable characters and amazing score, only those issues that bugged me a little bit, but it still, it's one of the best animated movies ever made!! IF you haven't watched yet, and I doubt it, go see it, right now!
I'm gonna give Toy Story an A!!!!"

","24 years after its release, the first Pixar feature film remains a hallmark in its library and cinema as a whole. Full of humor and humanity, Toy Story is a finely crafted blockbuster with impeccable script delving into our natural yearning for affection and acceptance of one's self.<br/><br/>Toy Story is centered between the struggle of Woody and Buzz for Andy's affection, their owner. Buzz is the newcomer and he replaces Woody as Andy's favorite toy. Driven by insecurity, Woody causes Buzz out of their house and this starts the film's main plot of both getting lost and trying to find their way back home. Buzz during this period continues to believe that he is indeed a true space ranger. Woody's true character is gradually unraveled for his utmost devotion to Andy and simultaneously convincing Buzz that he is a mere toy. By a set of circumstances both land on their neighbors house and under the possession of Sid, the toy destroyer kid. Inside Sid's house happens the reveal that shocks Buzz to the core, finding his true meaning: to make kids happy. Toy Story plays off both themes and subplot satisfyingly without sacrificing drama over humor. In fact, both drama and humor come hand in hand.<br/><br/>Toy Story looks dated now with 2 decades of technological improvement, but during its time was revolutionary. It should be judged as such. The film is a visual splendor with bright colors aided with a rousing score and an original song by Randy Newman.<br/><br/>For anyone interested in animated films, Toy Story should come first on the recommendation list.<br/><br/>10/10"

Rather than filling the time with cute animals, catchy songs, and a story that caters to the lowest, or youngest, common denominator, each of these elements is subtly accentuated and elevated so adults in the audience can appreciate the humor, themes, and well crafted narrative alongside the youth in the audience that are the film's target demographic.<br/><br/>The Bad:
It's very difficult, if not impossible, to find fault with this film. Since it's release, Toy Story has been lauded for every aspect of its production by critics, industry insiders, and audiences at large. But, the years that have past since the film's release have become its biggest drawback. Pixar has released 20 films since Toy Story graced the screens at the time of this writing, including 3 direct sequels to this film. With each new film Pixar has released they've innovated the technology and techniques to define the ever-evolving standard of computer animated films. With each new benchmark in the genre this film has fallen further and further behind looking less and less like the state of the art film that it was in 1995.<br/><br/>The Ugly:
To piggy-back off of my ""Bad"" for this film, it's hard to find a film that did it better than this, but perhaps we can look to the direct sequel, Toy Story 2 (John Lasseter, Ash Brannon, and Lee Unkrich, 1999). This follow up did everything to one-up it's predecessor. It expanded the world around Woody, Buzz, and company outside of a few simple settings and added an exposition for Woody that accentuates a part of what was good about the first film. Adult viewers at the time of release might have been taken back to their own youths and the corporate studio television shows with toy tie-ins like The Mickey Mouse Club and Howdy Doody. With growth and maturity in the studio's ability to create engrossing stories and improvements in animation in the four years between releases, this film further entrenched the franchise, and solidified Pixar as the premier computer animation studio."

"Tornado_Sam","Null","0","0","26 June 2019"," The first feature-length CGI movie is not a disappointment
","While in general I tend to go for the classic animation style as opposed to all the fancy CGI stuff that goes on nowadays, you have to admit: These Disney-Pixar features are really quite entertaining. While this 3-d animation style has been overused a lot over the past decade, the films are admittedly fun, creative, and suspenseful; they are movies for all ages; and they are, furthermore, among the best and most harmless children's classics to be found today (set aside the upcoming ""Frozen II"").<br/><br/>""Toy Story"" was, from what I gather, Pixar's first film and also the world's first CGI feature length movie. It plays upon an old, used but still timeless concept: that of toys and inanimate objects coming to life whilst the owners are away. In ""Toy Story"", the main characters are toy cowboy named Woody and toy space ranger Buzz Lightyear. (Call me crazy, but I am not familiar with either and still enjoyed it; you do not need to understand whom the toys are based upon to like it). Woody is the leader of all the toys in Andy's room, where they are played with every day. In their spare time, they come to life to have their own fun, and Woody (being the favorite) enjoys being in charge. Until Buzz shows up on Andy's birthday, and becomes the new favorite with all his fancy gear, 'lasers' and such. The two are soon in competition, which results in both ending up outside their house where a dangerous and ridiculously crazy adventure awaits.<br/><br/>That being the basic synopsis, you can tell that in terms of storyline the movie is very simplistic. Yet it doesn't need a complex and overblown plot to be fun (although the ridiculously absurd ending is admittedly overdone) and in terms of intrigue and comedy it does a pretty good job. The characters are easy to sympathize with (how many of us have felt rejected over someone else?) and the parts are well-played. Woody and Buzz both work quite well in character--even if Woody is a completely self-centered jerk--and the minor parts are also nicely done. (As pointed out by other reviewers, the supporting cast of toys mostly deliver the comedy, although Woody's ""Mr. Light-Beer"" is a definite winner). For the most part, it is entirely child-friendly, although I can imagine that many kids would be a little frightened by Sid--who is more like Satan-as-a-mad-doctor in human form than a neighborhood kid. (Also, what kind of parents lets their kid play with fireworks?). As I said before, the crazy ending is as overblown as it gets, but that's part of what makes it memorable.<br/><br/>In general, a fun film for families or otherwise, and definitely a classic when it comes to CGI animation. Only about an hour and a half and it does not pad itself out and stays within the appropriate run-time bounds. A nice update on the 'living toys' motif."

","Introduction:
""Toy Story"" was the first film to come out of Pixar. And frankly, it still remains as one of the best. While, in my opinion, the weakest film in the series, that doesn't mean it's at all bad. Toy Story is still an amazing film, and one of the best animated films of all time.<br/><br/>The Story:
Telling the story of two enemies that becomes best friends by the end. Not needing to be complicated, the film tells a very simple story, that can be enjoyed by adults and kids.<br/><br/>And I just love the idea of what the toys in your room are up to while you're not looking.<br/><br/>The Characters:
Woody and Buzz Light-year are two of my favorite characters in all of cinema. As they both go through their respective arcs. Woody learning that he doesn't have to be the center of his owner Andy's attention. And Buzz, who learns that he can accept the place he has in the world.<br/><br/>The Animation:
Being the first full length computer animated movie, the style was impressive for time, but is not all that impressive today. However, it did look good back then, and I can forgive the film.<br/><br/>Conclusion:
Toy Story may not be my favorite in the Toy Story series, but it's still a great film. And one of my favorite films of all time."

","Honestly, I don't think I can fully appreciate Toy Story's boldness and uniqueness, as Pixar has since made great family computer generated animated movies ubiquitous, and I certainly have been able to take that for granted my whole life. Even so, watching Toy Story for the first time in over a decade, it exceeded my expectations in its characters and script, and the animation looks as good as ever. Woody's internal struggles and seeing a protagonist of a kid's movie be clearly flawed but still likable is so refreshing. I love the animosity between Woody and Buzz, and the way the toys each have their own quirks but are something of a hive mind. Even if the events that occur are a bit over the top, the structure and plot is actually really exciting and coherently presented. I loved the misjudgement of Sid's toys and their role in the success. I've seen movies twice as long fail to deliver on half as realistic and well fleshed out characters or emotional stakes as in Toy Story. Between the groundbreaking animation for the time, the consistent characters and plot, and sheer adolescent joy and adventure, Toy Story deserves its place as a classic."

","'Toy Story (1995)' is written incredibly well; everything just seems to fall, very satisfyingly, into place. What sets it apart from pretty much all others in its genre is just how flawed its protagonist is. He's a borderline anti-hero, self-destructively selfish for the movie's majority. This makes his arc all the more satisfying, though, even if it's about as classic as you can get. The friendship that forms between the two central characters feels palpable and genuinely fulfilling because it's nuanced and consistently strained. It really is remarkable that a film about talking toys has some of the most satisfying character arcs and central relationships of all time. Of course, the piece is also very funny. It fully uses its central conceit to deliver some truly inventive laughs. It doesn't feel as though it's pandering to children, either; in fact, it feels rather mature, all things considered. It's a fantastic time that will resonate with everyone who watches. It really is a classic, one to be considered amongst the greats - animated or otherwise. 10/10"

","This film was the very beginning of CG animated films that completely dominate the animation industry now. And seeing as it is the very first of its kind, a likely assumption is that it is not very good. However when you watch this film you will find out that is so far from the truth.
Toy Story not only started a new art style, a new era of film, comedy, and entertainment, but it also is a genuinely heartfelt incredible film! Pixar was able to make human beings feel sympathy for inanimate objects. That alone is noteworthy, but it goes even farther than that. This film is so entertaining and exciting; you will not want to look away from the screen. The animation has definitely aged, however that doesn't take away from the fact that this story and these characters are timeless. Woody and Buzz have cemented themselves in pop culture and all of our childhoods, and even when viewed on a critical level, these characters and this film is amazing!
Even though I adore this film, I feel like when compared to 2 and 3, this one is the worst out of those, because 2 and 3 discover a story that's even more intriguing and thought-provoking than this one.
There were some instances in this film that felt kind of cliche, and convenient, ie: the random gust of wind that made Buzz fly at the end. But in its heart, this film is far from bad, and is waaaaay better than most animated features being released today on every level (except animation).
Let's just hope the 4th one lives up to the trilogy."

"cbobs","10","0","0","22 May 2019"," By far my favorite Pixar movie and my second favorite Disney and animated film in general. Joint with 2 and 3
","No wait, I literally cannot rank all three Toy Story movies because i love them all equally. But if i had to choose i would probably say 1,3 and then 2. I mean what's not to love about Toy Story. A sharp-witted, cleverly written story about toys coming to life. I mean, do you notice why there hasn't been another big or successful film following the same idea of toys coming to life. Because, this is the perfect one. Nothing will ever be able to top it. They've set the bar way too high. Such a great premise which is played off brilliantly. Tom Hanks is my favorite ever animated voice actor. The energy he radiates through his words prove why he is my favorite actor of all time. His best quote OBVIOUSLY being ""YOU ARE A TOYYYYY!!!!!"" Tim Allen also does an excellent job. Especially, with the 'Mrs Nesbitt!!' scene and bits from earlier on when he believes he is a Space Ranger. Other actors like John Ratzenberger and Don Rickles do well and Wallace Shawn does a great job with voicing the lovable dinosaur Rex. However, this is by far my favorite Pixar film, but not my favorite Disney or animated film in general. I would have to give that to 'The Lion King.' At the time, this film would have been so technically impressive. I mean this was mid 90's and the affects still look great today. With such a great premise for a film, it plays it to it's advantages and making everyday boring objects seem like an obstacle for the toys. Probably the best example of this is 'The Claaaw.' Yes, the arcade machine that is often criticized for scamming people by making them pay money for a slim chance of winning a soft toy is used as a plot device. But does that stop me from getting that Spider-man or Ant Man plushie. Hell no! The world they create through the film is so creative and well done that it's hard not to call the film a masterpiece. So let's talk about the plot. Woody is a cowboy toy who is the leader of all the other toys in Andy's room. The toys job is to be played with and keep Andy happy. Oh and also not to be seen alive. Anyway, on Andy's birthday a new toy shows up. A popular space ranger toy named Buzz Lightyear. However, Buzz actually believes he is a space ranger and not a toy. He proves it by 'flying' when instead he is just using a hot wheels track and a lampshade to swing around. This leads top one of the greatest film quotes of all time ""That wasn't flying that was falling with style."" However, both the toys and Andy seem to admire Buzz leaving Woody jealous. Which refers to the astronaut takeover in the 1960's when kids stopped idolizing cowboys and began idolizing astronauts and 'space rangers.' Woody creates a plan to get rid of Buzz by pushing him out of the window. It works but leads to him and Buzz getting stranded at a gas station. They manage to follow Andy to a Pizza and arcade building (basically Chuck E Cheese) where they are captured by evil next door neighbor Sid who blows toys up for fun. Here, Buzz learns through a TV advert and a fall down the stairs that he is a toy after all in quite a powerful and emotional scene. Buzz goes insane while Woody tries to escape with him. Woody realizes that Sid i going to blow him and Buzz up on the same day that Andy is supposed to move house. So Woody hitches a plan using some of Sid's poor toys who fell victim to Sid's evil experiments. Woody uses his string voice to warn Sid about the toys before coming to life to say the words ""So play nice!"" in one of the greatest movie scenes of all time. Buzz finally comes to his senses and him and Woody manage to get to the moving truck in time. So, anyway Toy Story is an animated masterpiece which will always be remembered, not only for it's stunning visuals but it's great story and characters."

Woody and The Rest of the Gang already know there Toys, but Buzz hasn't figured out that he's a toy yet. Toy Story then proceeds to spend two-thirds of it's run-time creating character development for Woody and Buzz to help them figure out their identity among the rest of Andy's Toys. What's interesting about this movie is just how common place in feels among all the other great films of the past, not just animated, but all feature films in general. Not to surprising considering the creative team behind the project. Gary Rydstrom sound design, Joss Whedons screenplay, and John Lasseter Directing really adds a whole other level of depth to the film that is both original and unique in concept, design, and execution. It's a smart, clever, funny, heart warming movie that kids, and adults can enjoy. It's about the importants of working together, being brave, overcoming adversity, and staying true to yourself.

Your best pleasures are for your eyes. But what a good movie! Seeing the film, both objectively and personally, it feels pleasant the fact, being a simple plot coupled with a good performance in it, Dawn of a new era of film animation, which is based on the best of cartoons and reality , creating a world somewhere in between, where space not only bends, but breaks, creaks and appears, is important. 4/5"

","Just like siblings. A war is fought. A cowboy and a space ranger. Fight for popularity... and play time. Toy story is a classic movie about toys living in their own universe. Once Andy, the toy's owner, leaves the room, the toys come to life. Toy story builds off this idea of toys coming to life and makes a whole adventure out of it. My 6-year old self cannot recommend this movie enough. I know with the amount of time I spent watching this movie, that I could have done a lot, but instead of doing something worthwhile, I watched toy story. I will tell you that it brought out a lot of creativity in me when I was young. I had every toy you could think of, and I knew, and still know, every lyric to ""You've Got a Friend in Me."" Toy Story is a pretty big deal to me for nostalgia reasons and because it's just a great movie overall. It is for sure a classic, and the idea and execution was thought out very well. Also, the movie had a lot of popular actors and an amazing soundtrack to just put that cherry right on top.<br/><br/>Toy Story is about toys that wake up when the owner, Andy, leaves the room. Andy gets a new toy for his birthday. The toy he gets is Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger toy. Before Andy gets Buzz, Woody was the most played with and popular toy. Andy gets Buzz and becomes obsessed with him. Buzz is popular between the other toys, and he also is starting to get all the play time as well. This of course, makes Woody mad and jealous. Most of the movie Buzz thinks he is a real life space ranger which makes for some pretty good comedy. This annoys Woody also. Basically the whole movie is like some siblings fighting for more attention from their parents. In the middle of all this fighting between the two of them, they end up in the hands of the neighbor Sid. He is the kid next door that sabotages and brakes toys for fun. You can see how that is an amazing idea of an antagonist. But when they get taken a lot of things happen is it for the better or worse you will just have to find out.<br/><br/>Toy story is a humorous classic, nobody can deny this. Toy Story brings the idea of toys to a whole new level. After watching this movie when I was young I never thought of toys the same. I cared for my toys more and honestly thought that they came to life when I left the room.The humor is great for a kids movie. A lot of the parts where Buzz thinks he is actually a space ranger and he is making fun of Woody always give a nice little chuckle. In one of the scenes Woody is lost from Andy because of Buzz and Woody is screaming at Buzz who still thinks he is a real space ranger and Woody is screaming, ""You're a toy. You're a child's play thing!"" then after that Buzz says,"" You're a sad strange little man, and you have my pity."" There is also a pretty big change from the beginning of the movie to the end with a great message. I won't spoil the change you'll just have to watch the movie. I will say though, that it might have something to do with one of the themes, friendship.<br/><br/>Toy Story has Tom Hanks and Tim Allen as the main characters. Woody is Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks is a very famous actor starring in movies like: Forrest Gump, Cast Away, and Big. All these movies are very popular and are all great movies like Toy Story. If you are going to give it a shot it might be because of Tom Hanks acting skills. Tim Allen plays Buzz. He is a very popular actor in movies like Santa Claus and Cars. This movie doesn't just have great actors it also has an amazing soundtrack with a truly unforgettable song You've Got a Friend in Me. There are tons of other songs that will make you wanna sing out loud like Strange Things and I Will Go Sailing No More. All the songs and the cast are never to be forgotten.<br/><br/>Toy Story has a lot of themes. One of many I could think of is, friendship which is shown by Buzz and Woody.

"palmerk-49084","10","0","0","13 March 2019"," Toy Story the True Classic
","Just like siblings. A war is fought. A cowboy and a space ranger. Fight for popularity... and play time. Toy story is a classic movie about toys living in their own universe. Once Andy, the toy's owner, leaves the room, the toys come to life. Toy story builds off this idea of toys coming to life and makes a whole adventure out of it. My 6-year old self cannot recommend this movie enough. I know with the amount of time I spent watching this movie, that I could have done a lot, but instead of doing something worthwhile, I watched toy story. I will tell you that it brought out a lot of creativity in me when I was young. I had every toy you could think of, and I knew, and still know, every lyric to ""You've Got a Friend in Me."" Toy Story is a pretty big deal to me for nostalgia reasons and because it's just a great movie overall. It is for sure a classic, and the idea and execution was thought out very well. Also, the movie had a lot of popular actors and an amazing soundtrack to just put that cherry right on top.<br/><br/>Toy Story is about toys that wake up when the owner, Andy, leaves the room. Andy gets a new toy for his birthday. The toy he gets is Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger toy. Before Andy gets Buzz, Woody was the most played with and popular toy. Andy gets Buzz and becomes obsessed with him. Buzz is popular between the other toys, and he also is starting to get all the play time as well. This of course, makes Woody mad and jealous. Most of the movie Buzz thinks he is a real life space ranger which makes for some pretty good comedy. This annoys Woody also. Basically the whole movie is like some siblings fighting for more attention from their parents. In the middle of all this fighting between the two of them, they end up in the hands of the neighbor Sid. He is the kid next door that sabotages and brakes toys for fun. You can see how that is an amazing idea of an antagonist. But when they get taken a lot of things happen is it for the better or worse you will just have to find out.<br/><br/>Toy story is a humorous classic, nobody can deny this. Toy Story brings the idea of toys to a whole new level. After watching this movie when I was young I never thought of toys the same. I cared for my toys more and honestly thought that they came to life when I left the room.The humor is great for a kids movie. A lot of the parts where Buzz thinks he is actually a space ranger and he is making fun of Woody always give a nice little chuckle. In one of the scenes Woody is lost from Andy because of Buzz and Woody is screaming at Buzz who still thinks he is a real space ranger and Woody is screaming, ""You're a toy. You're a child's play thing!"" then after that Buzz says,"" You're a sad strange little man, and you have my pity."" There is also a pretty big change from the beginning of the movie to the end with a great message. I won't spoil the change you'll just have to watch the movie. I will say though, that it might have something to do with one of the themes, friendship.<br/><br/>Toy Story has Tom Hanks and Tim Allen as the main characters. Woody is Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks is a very famous actor starring in movies like: Forrest Gump, Cast Away, and Big. All these movies are very popular and are all great movies like Toy Story. If you are going to give it a shot it might be because of Tom Hanks acting skills. Tim Allen plays Buzz. He is a very popular actor in movies like Santa Claus and Cars. This movie doesn't just have great actors it also has an amazing soundtrack with a truly unforgettable song You've Got a Friend in Me. There are tons of other songs that will make you wanna sing out loud like Strange Things and I Will Go Sailing No More. All the songs and the cast are never to be forgotten.<br/><br/>Toy Story has a lot of themes. One of many I could think of is, friendship which is shown by Buzz and Woody. The change, that I can't tell you about, really shows this. Speaking of change, that is a theme too. Change can sometimes be hard. When Woody first sees Buzz he starts to get jealous and obviously mad, like a kid would get mad when their parents had a baby and it gets all the attention.<br/><br/>Toy story will always have a special place in my heart. The movie taught me about friendship and told what change means. I will always think of it as one of the best movies of all time. These lyrics right here show you why this movie is so great, ""Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am. Bigger and stronger too, maybe.

","Having recently viewed the Toy Story 4 teaser on YouTube, I felt the need to revisit these movies. I can honestly say that Toy Story is as important to animated cinema as Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in that both movies were the first feature length animated productions ever done in their respective mediums: Toy Story being the first computer-animated feature and Snow White being the world's first traditionally-animated feature.<br/><br/>Toy Story is as synonymous with cinema as the works of Francis Ford Coppola, Stanley Kubrick, Hayao Miyazaki and Chuck Jones: it's a film that shows the best of every world in the imagination. There are toys that embody cowboys, spacemen, wrestlers, dogs, potatoes and figures that resemble the uber-edginess the mid-90s garnered thanks to hit video games like Doom and Mortal Kombat. Toy Story is a film that knows exactly what makes kids movies resonate with adults: having an emotional bridge that's built into the story itself where playtime and wisdom, as the fundamental themes to the film, is symbolic of the concept of people growing up and how that can change the world around you. You can still mature in ways that still keep you young and hopeful at heart even when everything around you is totally unpredictable and volatile.<br/><br/>This film is a zeitgeist movie for the 90s and it's still technically very impressive to this very day. I'm struggling to find faults with this movie: it's one of those special movies that you can watch repeatedly and still find something new every time you watch it again.<br/><br/>Toy Story is a 5/5 star masterpiece."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","0","0","15 November 2018"," Pioneering in every way, and remains a great film in its own right
","""Toy Story"" came out when I was in third grade and it remains the most revolutionary film of my lifetime. Outside of Pixar's offices, who would've predicted that in 1995, at the at the height of Disney's 2D animated musical resurgence, that the course of animated family films had just been changed forever.<br/><br/>And it wasn't just the technology. ""Toy Story"" undoubtedly deserves to be heralded until the end of time for being the first computer-animated feature film, but so many other forces contributed to it becoming the year's box-office champion, chief among them - story.<br/><br/>Pixar's first concept exemplifies all the incredible storytelling they've done in the last 20-plus years: What do our toys do when no one is watching? Children's imaginations have infused their toys with life ever since there were toys, and ""Toy Story"" plays out that fantasy for kids while evoking profound nostalgia for the parents.<br/><br/>This ""hidden world"" notion, with stories that explore little universes hiding in plain sight, has been Pixar's secret story sauce. Just take a look at the movie's credits to see how that concept influenced future classics: Pixar father (and the film's director) John Lasseter (""A Bug's Life,"" ""Cars""), Pete Docter (""Monsters Inc.,"" ""Up,"" ""Inside Out"") and Andrew Stanton (""Finding Nemo,"" ""WALL-E"").<br/><br/>But even a brilliant concept needs anchoring in real, universal human themes, and that's the real reason Pixar has been the cream of the crop ever since November 22, 1995. In ""Toy Story,"" that boils down to the characters of Woody and Buzz. There's Woody, who has the whole being a toy thing figured out and enjoys his cozy little ""spot"" as Andy's favorite. Then there's Buzz Lightyear, the shiny new novelty who hasn't had the existential realization that he's not a space ranger yet. It's a storyline for these two leads born out of something that happens all the time: kids' tastes change and they're always moving on to the next cool toy. Woody's jealousy and Buzz's naivete are relatable to kids and adults alike.<br/><br/>That takes us to the crowning touch on ""Toy Story"" - the voice acting (no, not Randy Newman, but he's crucial to the film's complete aesthetic). Only with the casting of Robin Williams as the Genie in ""Aladdin"" a couple years earlier had there even existed the notion of casting big-name actors in animated films. Even then, like Williams, the name parts were given to comedians in the comic relief roles. Getting Tom Hanks to play the lead role was a total coup, and when ""Toy Story"" made bank, animation studios immediately began putting together cast lists of name actors that could barely fit on a movie poster.<br/><br/>Hanks' Woody still deserves to rank as one of the best voice-acting performances. He's the emotional signpost keeping young viewers in tune with how they should feel at each moment (though Buzz's botched flight attempt is the emotional apex of the movie to be sure). Hanks isn't merely lending his voice to the film, he's playing the role of Woody, and it makes all the difference.<br/><br/>During my many childhood viewings, ""Toy Story"" always felt like an exhaustive multi-chapter journey, especially once Woody and Buzz leave the confines of Andy's room, so on this revisit it's funny to realize that the film remains Pixar's shortest. That's how much dimension Lasseter and team pack into this movie and a large part of why it endures. Any notion that ""Toy Story"" was a ""cute"" first attempt by a studio that would go on to vastly improve upon it is missing the point. Yes, Pixar would get more visually advanced, build even more intricate worlds and tell even more emotionally deeper stories (and all in the ""Toy Story"" series alone), but all those elements in this film still stand strong on their own. It's a classic, and one that set the bar upon which all those films were left with no choice but to strive for.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"

It has an incredibly interesting plot. I mean a toy sheriff has to deal with the jealousy as a toy space soldier takes his place as Andy's favorite? That already is enough to catch someone's attention. Then the acting is superb. The animation is done beautifully and the story is extremely fluid and is paced beautifully.

","This is the film that started one of the best animation companies, Pixar, in 1995. Toy Story is one of those revolutionary movies! It's the first full-length computer animated film ever! Toy Story inspired companies to make animated movies in it's style, even Disney, whom was struggling after it's Renaissance in the 90's, was attempting in Pixar's technique. Now Pixar could've just created a mediocre movie, and still get some points for it's technological achievements. But Pixar didn't do that, in fact, they made one of the best animated films ever made. Even though Toy Story isn't a 100% original idea, they made an excellent variation of it and it had it's identity. All of the acting is perfect! Tom Hanks as Sheriff Woody is a perfect casting choice, along with Tim Allen as Buzz, and every single other character. I loved Tom Hanks performance in movies such as Forrest Gump(1996) and The Green Mile(1999) but honestly him as Woody is his most memorable performance, even though he's perfect in those movies also. This film also had some emotional moments, helping Pixar get an identity of having those kind of moments in their movies. The emotional moments are nothing compared to the sequels of Toy Story, but they are definitely good. My only issue is the animation, for it didn't all age too well...especially the humans. This may be the reason why the main characters in the older Pixar movies in particular are animals, creatures, or inanimate objects(referring to toys). Even with it's aged animation, it could surprisingly be better than some animated movies later on...specifically direct to DVD movies like Norm of the North(2016) or Foodfight(2012), which had a budget of 65 million dollars...all of that money was wasted. Despite it's few flaws, Toy Story is a magnificent movie that pretty much everyone has at least seen once! I give this movie: 9.7/10=10/10 overall"

But I still think they're all wonderful toys. When it comes to the main characters, I'm personally not a fan of Woody, but I'm a massive fan of Buzz; in fact, I only watch this film due to Buzz, and it's Buzz who plays the biggest part of this movie: Buzz is what makes this movie.

","Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library."

","In a world in which toys talk and move whenever humans are not looking, a cowboy doll experiences jealousy for the very first time after an action figure replaces him as his owner's favourite toy in this popular animated comedy. The premise lends itself to a number of perplexing unanswered questions (in particular, regarding the 'rules' that the toys follow to freeze as soon as there is the possibility of a human seeing them move) but if one accepts the basic notion and runs with it, the film offers a surprisingly compelling story with striking personal identity themes as both of the main toys come to realise that they are not as special as they once thought. For Woody, it comes with realising that his owner can have other favourite toys and for Buzz it comes from awakening to the fact that he actually is a toy and not the famous space commander that he is designed as being. The film is blessed by excellent animation effects too; while many entirely computer generated animated films have come out in the years since, few have used the process quite so delightfully with lots of mobile tracking and panning shots that would have been near impossible to get right in a live action feature. The changing facial reactions on the toys (especially Woody) are impressive too - even if the fact that the toys in the film look more realistic than the humans in the film never quite feels right. This is, of course, a film about the toys though, and fanciful as the premise may well be, there is a lot to like about their loyalty both towards their owners and each other."

","The same goes for Tim Allen, though the body gestures were most likely not modeled after Allen's physical expressions (Buzz is a short, pot-bellied toy).<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is excellent, all very believable and entertaining. You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing.<br/><br/>I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was 'A Bug's Life,' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had.<br/><br/>Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. 'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30's-60's: Respect for the audience's intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made – something that fans like me would rather have than something like 'Finding Nemo.'"

","I have seen this several times before, although apparently I never rated it at IMDb. I've only started adding ratings to my lists of watched movies in the past few years, so I don't know if I actually rated it before. If I had, I might have given it a 9 or 10 in previous years, but after watching it again, I'd have to give it an 8. Most of this lowered rating is due to Woody's petulance and jealousy in the first half of the film, although the second half makes up for it.<br/><br/>Of course, it IS the first computer-animated film, and ushered in a new era of animation. Still, is that necessarily a good reason for giving it a higher rating? I wouldn't categorize this as my favorite Pixar film by any means, although it's certainly not my least favorite. I'm of mixed emotions regarding the Randy Newman music. I enjoy some of his songs (like You've Got a Friend in Me,) but dislike his singing. Also, whenever I hear him singing, I'm reminded of the Family Guy bit where he basically just sings what he sees."

","Making history at the rate of 24 frames per second throughout its 81 minutes of runtime, Pixar Animation Studios' feature film debut is one of the greatest filmmaking achievements that didn't just transform the entire animation industry with its groundbreaking computer animation but also set a whole new standard for its genre with its inventive storytelling, thus instantly cementing its place in the annals of cinema.<br/><br/>The first fully computer-animated feature-length film in cinema history, Toy Story follows the adventures of a group of toys that belong to a young kid named Andy but mainly focuses on the relationship between Andy's long-time favourite toy Woody; a cowboy doll & his latest birthday gift that turns out to be Buzz Lightyear; an action figure who's unaware that he's a toy but nevertheless threatens Woody's long-held position.<br/><br/>Directed by John Lasseter, Toy Story introduces its animation studio on a grand note for it brims with originality, creativity, imagination, passion & innovation from start to finish and marks the biggest leap for its medium since Walt Disney's Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs surfaced on the film canvas back in 1937. But what makes it one of the best animated films of all time is its seamless blend of sophisticated storytelling with state-of-the-art animation.<br/><br/>The screenplay is a gem in itself too for the plot is tightly knitted, makes excellent use of wit & is inhabited by a colourful set of characters who exhibit a stunning level of depth in their respective arcs. Its make-believe world is extremely convincing, the references n homages it makes to earlier classics is tastefully carried out, the relationship between kids & their toys is nailed to perfection and it also manages to convey its themes with effortless finesse.<br/><br/>Adding more heart n soul to its characters are the talented voices behind it spearheaded by Tom Hanks & Tim Allen who infuse life into Woody & Buzz Lightyear respectively plus their on-screen chemistry is absolutely fantastic. Cinematography is expertly carried out, pacing is very brisk for the film never loses momentum & keeps getting better as plot progresses while Randy Newman's music instills an immense feeling of joy, warmth & wonder with its adventurous tracks.<br/><br/>And then of course there is the revolutionary 3D animation that marked the dawn of a new era in animation which soon went on to completely re-invent its medium. It may not look as spellbinding today as it did back in 1995 but its influence on film, technology, video games & even computer graphics ever since cannot be understated, nor can be denied the role it played in the rise of new animation studios which ultimately put its medium in the same league that other genres have enjoyed since long.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Toy Story is a magical blend of kinetic direction, smart screenplay, rich characters, ideal voice cast, dynamic camera-work, terrific editing & heartwarming score that's freshly envisioned, ingeniously composed & gorgeously animated. A masterwork of jaw-dropping quality refined to perfection that triumphs in all aspects, Toy Story marks a significant moment in cinema for it marks the arrival of what would later become arguably the most acclaimed as well as critically & commercially excelling film studio of our time."

","I very fondly remember watching this film as a child and to this day it it still one of Pixar's finest efforts, especially if it's their first feature-length animation.<br/><br/>As for the animation, it is pretty impressive for 1995 and the most realistically-modelled toys are Etch-A-Sketch and Mr Potato Head, although the main toys Woody and Buzz are well-designed as well. There are some funny moments such as Mr Potato Head pretending to be a Picasso painting and Sid's sister Hannah dressing Buzz up as a woman and naming him Mrs Nesbitt at a tea party as well as some dark, sinister moments such as Sid making mutant toys that eventually scare him off and the tense moment of Woody and Buzz's rivalry including the memorable, ""You are a toy!"" line. Other lines I remember from this film are Buzz's catchphrase ""To infinity and beyond"" and Woody's many phrases such as ""You're my favourite deputy"" and ""There's a snake in my boots"" to name just two. The opening scene involving Andy playing with Woody accompanied by Randy Newman's 'You've Got A Friend In Me' is one of the film's most captivating parts and I liked the product placement of toy manufacturers (Rex being made by Mattel and Mr Potato Head being made by Playskool).<br/><br/>Overall, this is a dark and funny start to my favourite trilogy of animated films. 10/10."

","Toy Story came out right in the middle of a golden period for Disney. It was released on the back of the critically acclaimed (and box office hits): Beauty and The Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. Because of this (and Toy Story being Disney's first collaboration with Pixar), there must have been considerable pressure on the picture to succeed. The idea of toys coming to life is a seemingly sure-fire winner for a family film. However, this could easily have been handled badly. This is not the case with Toy Story. <br/><br/>The pioneering animation, brilliantly written script, top notch voice performances, and shrewd direction make this a timeless animated film. <br/><br/>Much has been said about the groundbreaking Pixar computer animation. This is understandable and justified. The visualisation of the story world is inventive and innovative. The quality of the animation enables the audience to capture the essence of the world and fully immerse themselves within it. <br/><br/>The film's script is incredibly tight. It is witty and exhilarating; whilst containing heart and drive in abundance. I would go as far as to say that this film has the best script out of the three Toy Story films (which is no mean feat). <br/><br/>The script is also effective in its use of characterisation, and it is especially prevalent with Woody. He's certainly not your archetypal Disney hero, but that's why he (and the film) works so well. He can be petulant, prone to jealousy and mood swings, insecure, and devious. These reasons (and others) are why Woody is loved; he has human qualities. He has his flaws, but he has a good heart. <br/><br/>The voice actors are exceptional in bringing the script to life. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen shine in their leading roles as Woody and Buzz. The supporting cast are also highly effective in their performances. A notable example would be Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head; he gets a fair share of the film's laughs (especially from the adult proportion of the audience). <br/><br/>Much of this would not have been possible without a safe pair of hands in charge of bringing all of these elements together. John Lasseter's directing expertise is there for all to see with his handling of this picture. <br/><br/>There are also some stand out moments from the film that solidify its stature. They are directly linked with the two backbones of the picture; Woody and Buzz. The 'Strange Things' sequence in which Woody watches his whole world fall apart before him (as Buzz takes over Andy's room) is beautifully shot and realised. The other stand out moment is when Buzz watches his perceived world (and sense of self) revealed to be false as he stares in disbelief at the Buzz Lightyear TV advertisement. His subsequent attempt to fly out of the window is, once again, exquisitely shot and ethereal. Another consistent ingredient between these two moments is the poignant and perfectly suited music by Randy Newman. <br/><br/>Toy Story is a film that seamlessly brings together the many aspects that make a great film. It possesses a strong premise and story, great characters, awesome visuals, and a great soundtrack. It is certainly no surprise that the film has gone on to influence many other computer animation features; whilst also being responsible for kick-starting one of the greatest trilogies in American cinema."

","Toy Story, the first of the series, was a spectacular achievement. Not only was it completely rendered digitally, the quality was very high to equal or better most standard animation, but it was actually excellent fun. On top of that, you had the novel idea of a toy's secret life, a great story, awesome voice acting, lots of jokes, a bit of drama, some suspense, real life conflicts of personality, solid dialogs, and some heroics, all of which resulted in a complete package that anyone of any age can appreciate.<br/><br/>The cast distribution was done smartly, each actor corresponding perfectly to their characters. The soundtrack was discreet and avoided a big sing along, which is a blessing.<br/><br/>The only thing that could be thought of as negative was the technology limitation at the time. The colors are a bit stiff, lacking a bit of shadowing and lighting, but it's really minimal, certainly not enough to distract from this quality piece.<br/><br/>I highly recommend it unless you're not interested in animation at all."

Even though the movie is targeted for children and is the movie that every single child watches during their child hood, its so good that even adults absolutely love it.<br/><br/>The film follows the tale of Andy's toys who are, unknown to all humans, actually alive. During the movie, as Buzz, Andy's new toy comes, Sheriff Woody becomes jealous of Buzz as he becomes Andy's new favorite and attempts to put an end to it but Buzz gets his revenge. However, the two get captured by Sid, the evil kid next door that enjoys torturing toys and must try their best to escape. To be fair, this movie is one of the shortest films I've ever seen but also one of the most enjoyable.<br/><br/>The voice acting for the film is just masterful. Tom Hanks voice acting of Woody is just brilliant and Tim Allen as Buzz was brilliant. The voice acting just added further strength to every aspect of the film.<br/><br/>The animations for a 1995 film, being the first 3D animated film, is just visually amazing! Though it may not stand out against recent visual animations, this movie is just a joy to watch, even after 18 years! <br/><br/>One thing that is incredibly cool is that they don't explain how exactly the toys ever were alive and its great to see such thing left anonymous. I also found the characters extremely entertaining and the way that Buzz and Woody become friends during the film is just well made! <br/><br/>Also, having your main characters toys and in fact making a movie entirely based on toys can be some pain and something which people just laugh at but in this film, we as an audience are emotionally connected to these plastic toys! Its because, despite being toys, the director portrays these as human like things which makes it extremely interesting to us. <br/><br/>The dialogue in the film is great and as a result it constantly made me laugh. I loved that little kid as a villain. I thought he was fascinating and I'm glad that very little time is spent about Andy. <br/><br/>Despite being made for children all adults are sure to have a blast with this film. In fact, I don't see why nobody has yet to see this film. In case you haven't, be sure to remember that this film changed all animation films to come and that this is surely one of Pixar's ever most finest films!"

","Every child dreams of his toys coming to life and playing back, but the main idea has always been what it will be like if toys did come to life. Well Toy Story answered that question in a more enlighten way that made you eager to see more of the adventures Andy's toys were getting into. Toy Story has a masterpiece storyline that makes you just sit and wonder, the screenplay that blends this toy acts to human interaction is so well done, that if not that the fact that this can't be true, this movie may make kids think this is possible.<br/><br/>The movie is about a group of toys who pretend to be lifeless whenever humans are present and come to life to discuss, when humans are not around. The toys behavior, actions and fears are all based on their need to be played with by their owner.<br/><br/>This group of toys belong to a boy named Andy, and the Andy's favorite toy is Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), a cowboy dull. Things were rosy when Woody was on top, but then came a new toy who took Woody's place Buzz (Tim Allen). Now Woody who feels threatened tries to get back at Buzz but he drags himself down with his acts, and now he may never see Andy again.<br/><br/>Toy Story was the first fully computer animated feature film at its time and it came about when Disney approached Pixar to produce a computer animated feature for them after seeing their short animated film Tin Toy (1988). The production of this movie went through many ups and downs, mostly due to the fact that Disney wanted a story that was nail biting and out of this world perfect, which caused Pixar to work on re-writes that saw the lead characters changing form till they finally settled on Woody the wise leader of the Toys in Andy's room and Buzz the new addition to Andy's toys who is confused as to who he really is.<br/><br/>Then there was the talk between Pixar and Disney about songs. Disney's movies at that time were all musicals with the characters breaking into songs, to further pass their message along, but John Lasseter didn't want that at all claiming this is a buddy film, so the two reached a compromise, that the score of the movie will be directed towards the action at hand at the point. That can be seen in the movie at one point when Buzz wanted to fly out the window to prove that he could fly and that he was not a ""Toy"". The song that was playing during that scene of Buzz trying to fly had such lyrics as: ...no, it can't be true, I can fly if I wanted to.<br/><br/>Toy Story received massive recognition during its time Review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes has the movie at a 100% approval rating from critics and it also won Three Academy Awards (for Best Original Song, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay).<br/><br/>The movie was a financial success, and it gave birth to two other sequels which were bigger financial success Toy Story 2 (released in 1999 and gaining 100% approval at Rotten Tomatoes) and Toy story 3 (released in 2010 and gaining 99% approval at Rotten Tomatoes and it is the highest grossing animation till date making over 1 billion dollars).

","Every company has that one movie that puts them on the map. That is what Toy Story did for Pixar. Toy Story is a cartoon about a little boy's toy collection that is alive when the little boy is not around. His name is Andy and he loves his toys, and they love him back. Woody is a cowboy and is Andy's favorite toy. The toys always get worried every Christmas and birthday because they fear they will be replaced by a bigger and better toy. The story starts off with Andy's birthday party and all of the toys are on edge. It turns out that a new toy by the name of Buzz Lightyear challenges Woody as the favorite toy. Buzz comes along, steals a little bit of the spotlight and Woody gets incredibly jealous. Eventually Woody and Buzz get lost and must find their way home and back to Andy before he and his family move away forever.<br/><br/>Let's start with the toys. I loved these toys. Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Little Bow Peep, Woody, Buzz, Slink, Ham, and even Etch-a-Sketch are the main toys and each are lovable and different. Rex is hilarious because he is ironic. He is a dinosaur but he is a wimp, and he is my favorite of the toys. I remember watching as a little kid and I was always excited to see Rex on screen. Each character has their individual role. There are also toys every kid can relate with and that make the movie special. For example, the barrel of monkeys, the small soldiers, the etch-a-sketch, and Mr. Potato Head are toys every kid used to play with. The smaller toys aren't really relevant for long but when they are seen in the beginning and end of the movie their impact is huge. <br/><br/>One of the major themes in the story is jealousy and the relationship between Woody and Buzz. Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, was the favorite toy. Woody is a cowboy with a pull string that says some catch phrases. The other toys look up to him, he is a hero, and Andy loved him with all his heart. Andy dresses up like a cowboy, has Woody posters, and is obsessed with this toy. Woody embraces the love; it defines him, gives him confidence, and confirms that he is the leader. Then Buzz Lightyear comes into the picture with his better quality of a toy. He doesn't have a pull string, but a button Andy presses to have a better sound quality voice box will speak catch phrases. He is made of plastic, which is more durable and he has wings pop out which can simulate flight. Woody becomes incredibly jealous of Buzz and fights for Andy's love. He eventually knocks him out the window. Toy Story may be a kid's movie but it has an interesting and entertaining premise, especially with its characterization. Woody and Buzz both develop into better and stronger characters. Woody goes from a pompous, jealous, selfish, toy, into a respectable and lovable character. He and Buzz become best friends and inseparable, a little cliché, but it's a movie for families so it's perfect. When Buzz first appeared he thought he was a real ""space ranger."" He was convinced that he was not a toy, he could really fly, and he had a dangerous ""laser"" which was really a blinking light bulb. He develops and he eventually accepts the fact that he is a toy but he is a ""cool toy."" He is ""Andy's toy."" Woody admits his jealousy to Buzz and that becomes a turning point in their relationship.<br/><br/>We have our villain in the movie, Sid. This kid is just evil. He is a spoiled kid who ""terrorizes toys, just for fun."" One scene we the toys in Andy's room watch him as he straps firecrackers to a Commander Carl and it explodes. First of all, what kind of nine or ten year old kid plays with explosives? If he isn't nine or ten, what is he doing playing with kid toys? He may tear them apart and put different parts on them, making them scary and horrific for children to even see on screen, that just doesn't make sense. His character fits for a children's movie but in reality a kid like this would never exist in real life. Sid is really my only problem with the movie, but still a character needed for the film. <br/><br/>Overall, Toy Story is a classic and put Pixar on the map and was the beginning of a highly successful company. It came out in the 1995 and families everywhere fell in love, including me. It is a movie that can be watched again and again no matter what age. It is a movie kids will show their children when they are older. Teenagers lined up to see Toy Story 3 years later because it meant so much to them back when they were little. Toy Story and its characters left a rare imprint on the hearts of people all over the world. Without a doubt, Toy Story gets the WillyT Seal of Approval and goes down as one of my personal all time favorite animation movies."

A few years after the year 2000 is when the general public began favoring CGI films a lot more.<br/><br/>Personally, I still like traditional animated films because they provide a more storybook-like picture.

Toy Story is a film about a six year old boy named Andy, and his love of toys. Unbeknownst to Andy, his toys actually talk and communicate with each other.<br/><br/>Woody, who is voiced by Tom Hanks, is a cowboy doll with a pull string that allows him to speak a few select phrases. He considers himself to be the leader of all the other toys and Andy's favorite. When Andy has a birthday, he is given a new toy-a Buzz Lightyear action figure-that makes Woody feel very threatened. Buzz Lightyear, voiced by Tim Allen, is Andy's new toy and this makes Woody very fearful of ending up in the garage sale box with all the other old and broken toys. A series of mishaps occur between Buzz and Woody throughout the film causing even more tension and frustration between them. When they are captured by a little boy named Sid, who likes to torture and destroy toys, Buzz and Woody have to put aside their differences with each other and work together to be reunited with Andy. <br/><br/>I believe this film's main theme is about coming together despite our differences and working alongside of each other rather than against each other. Despite Woody's jealousy and insecurities he starts to form a bond with Buzz the more he really gets to know him. By forming this bond, it unites all the toys thus making them strong enough to accomplish great feats they normally wouldn't be able to do on their own. This theme is even more apparent with Buzz Lightyear's infamous saying ""To infinity and beyond!"" which implies that nothing is impossible when you have the help of friends. Ultimately, Buzz and Woody realize that nothing is as bad as it seems as long as they have each other. <br/><br/>Through the use of CGI, there is a realness factor that before the use of CGI, most animated films could not produce. The realistic graphics transport the viewer into the movie making them feel like a part of each characters' journey. There are lighting effects to emphasize certain emotions the director wants the viewer to feel. While the toys are united in Andy's bedroom everything is bright and colorful. When the toys are divided or separated from each other and Andy, the scenes are dim and dull. The amount of detail that went into each character's facial expressions was flawless. There is plenty of action, to keep young viewers entertained and there is wonderful dialog between the characters to keep the older viewers nostalgic by the wonderfully written story.<br/><br/>Toy Story is a revolutionary film in its own right. It set the path for the way audiences watch animated films. Toy Story is a heartwarming family film with a wonderful story about acceptance, teamwork, determination, and how powerful the love from a child can be. I highly recommend watching this film."

","A cowboy toy is profoundly threatened and jealous when a fancy spaceman toy supplants him as top toy in a boy's room.<br/><br/>As Pixar's projects nowadays are simply beautiful, back in 1995 they came up with the most imaginative project yet. Toy Story not only produced the technology that is now used now, it combines heart and hilarity. Of course, including all Pixar films, there is always something for the adults too. A lurking message in the background depicts friendship in the most heartwarming way. As this is so called a childhood memory in my mind, there is SO much memorable scenes that I can actually play in my mind! Example: The Pizza Planet scene, escaping Sid's house, or some of the heartwarming ones: Buzz realizing he is just a toy, Woody's jealously. The voice acting, especially realizing it was made it 1995, is amazing! Magically, it feels as if they are actual actors saying their lines. The score is beautiful and especially the main theme: ""You've Gotta Friend In Me."" The overall feeling while watching this masterpiece is brilliant and magical; only something Pixar could achieve. Although being possibly Pixar's best work, keep in mind that there are two sequels. Pixar has most possibly created one of the best trilogies. This reaching peaks of ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""The Godfather."" While you may laugh at that, watch it with an open mind and an open heart. Ignore the animation if it's not your style, and your going to be awe-inspired. Toy Story proves that animation can make great movies. 10/10."

","Oh come on, who couldn't like Toy Story? Not only is it the beginning of Pixar's dominance, it is an incredible landmark for it's time that has a multi generational impact in imagination. The only flaw is the fact that the animation is dated back to 1995, which back then it was incredible. Nevertheless a classic animated movie. The buddy dynamic between Woody and Buzz is hilarious, being that it's the veteran vs. rookie, grandfather vs. young toy, and Cowboy vs. Astronaut. I can't really describe what makes it just this good, but it is a simple story that works time and time again. 10/10 Thumbs up, recommended for all audiences."

","When ever I here someone hating on this movie I cant believe it. What is not to like about this movie? It is a story about realizing who your true friends are in times of trouble and learning to live with what you are. This movie is something not only kids will like but their parents will love it too. I know for a while my mom liked this movie more than I did. Tom Hanks was perfect for the role of Woody and his paranoid attitude is what makes the movie what it is (morally). Change is a good thing and this movie changed everything. Even though the graphics are obviously outdated everything still works as well as it did almost 20 years ago! and Im feeling old.... But it is a must see for anyone i would love to buy this movie but i cannot find it anywhere, that says something."

","This film is about a little boy named Andy who adores his toys and about the lives of those toys and the experiences they have while living with Andy. Some of the toys are Woody the western sheriff played by Tom Hanks, Buzz Lightyear played by Tim Allen, Mr. Potato head played by Don Rickles, Slinky Dog, Rex the dinosaur, and Bo Peep. The main characters are Andy, Sid (the mean kid next door), and Andy's mom. Andy's favorite toy and best friend is Woody. Woody is a sheriff from the Wild West and he and Andy are best friends. These two do everything together, but when Andy is not around, the toys come to life. Woody believes that he has the greatest life a toy could ever have; until, Andy's birthday party. This is where we meet Buzz light year the super hero that saves the galaxy from evil. Woody has a brief flash of jealousy when he realizes how much attention Buzz is getting, so he tries to set Buzz up and it goes all wrong. Buzz falls out the window onto Sid's property and this starts the beginning of Woody's quest to get buzz back and redeem himself with the other toys. The overall theme or message of the story is friendship. You got a friend in me, written by Randy Newman and performed by Tom Scott, is the theme song for Toy Story and encompass the exact message the creators of this film were going for. This holds true for movies like The Fox and the Hound and Milo and Otis. These movies take us on adventures where strength courage and friendship are prevalent and felt throughout the entire film. The director in this film used many different techniques to get the viewer to feel what he characters were feeling, he also used techniques to establish the theme throughout the film without over killing the message. One of the techniques Lasetter used was motifs of friendship. For instance, Woody struggles with trying to get Buzz to understand that he is a toy and not a real space ranger because he cares about Buzz's feelings. During this time they get lost, they are at odds because Woody knocked Buzz out the window and throughout all of this, they work together to find a way to get home to their favorite pal Andy. Every scene in the film displays examples of friendship, and I think they did a great job of showing the audience the importance of this simple act of humanity that we as people tend to forget. Although it was a children's movie this film was sure to impact the adults as well."

","Toy Story was the first full-length children's feature made entirely with computer-generated animation, and it was released in 1995. This film has an amazing plot, with great characters and actress which makes Toy Story the greatest animation film ever. Toy story is a buddy movie/adventure tale with an understated lesson about the value of friendship. ""You can count on me!"" Toy Story was about two toys, an old, beloved cowboy named woody (voice of Tom Hanks) and new beloved space ranger, named Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen). Both of these toys try and compete for the love of the human boy named Andy Davis (voice of John Morris) who plays with them, not knowing that they come alive when he lives the room. Toy Story takes place in Andy's bedroom where Woody is always placed on the bed and the rest of the toys are placed in the chest or on the shelves. One day the toys found out that Andy was having a birthday party and became scared that they might be replaced with newer toys. Woody the leader of the toys, calms the other toys down and sends a team of toy soldiers down stairs to scope out the new coming toys. As Andy is opening his gifts the most alarming arrival was brought to the scene when the new comer Buzz Lightyear was opened. Andy fell in love with Buzz Lightyear and ran up stairs and threw Woody off of the bed and replaced Buzz Lightyear in Woody's place. In the first half of the movie Woody and Buzz didn't get along and fought for the love of Andy and the other toys. As the plot takes a different direction when the family decides to move, Woody and Buzz find themselves stuck at the gas station with no idea on how to get home. This is where the theme of friendship takes over in the film. As Woody and Buzz starts to work together to find their way home Sin, Andy's next door neighbor picks them up. As the toys are placed in Sin's room they see Sin feed other toys to his dog. This is when Woody and Buzz join forces and try to escape the house before Sin feeds them to his the dog. Toy Story remains me of Avatar with the use of the computer- generated imagery. Like Toy Story, Avatar brought the characters to life with the use of all the different colors schemes, lighting and angles. Both of these films characters looked very human like and real and both won rewards for their use of animation."

","One of the most popular computer-animated films released in 1995, Toy Story takes place in the bedroom of a little boy named Andy Davis. With no human around all the toys in Andy's room come alive. One week prior to Andy's birthday the toys discover the newest addition which is a astronaut action figure named Buzz Lightyear. As the family is about to go to Pizza Planet to celebrate, Andy's pull-string toy Woody becomes jealous of Buzz and begin fighting as a result they accidentally knock themselves out the car window. As the car drives off, Woody and Buzz attempt to get back to Andy by way of a Planet Pizza delivery truck. This is where the journey begins as both Woody and Buzz undertake a plethora of dangerous obstacles such as the spaceship-shaped claw game machine, a nightmarish neighbor named Sid with Scud his voracious dog that takes pleasure in torturing toys. As Woody, the pull-string cowboy, and Buzz Lightyear, the astronaut action figure, soon learn to respect each other's differences and as a result of their adventure to Andy they become close friends. <br/><br/>By the time Woody and Buzz finally make it to Andy, the family has packed the moving truck and is about to drive away when the two toys use a daring stunt to catapult themselves into the family's car with almost perfect precision. Next the narrative shows the Davis family on Christmas Eve. As the movie comes to a close Andy's toys are shown organizing a mission to discover the new editions named Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head and a surprise arrival of a puppy. The movie ends with Woody and Buzz showing a look of concern on their faces in reference to the family's new puppy. <br/><br/>As the sequel to Toy Story, the film Toy Story 2 continues the pattern of the original film in which Andy's toys organize a reconnaissance mission to save Woody from an international toy dealer. In this movie the producers utilized the same computer-animated style that allowed audiences to view the toy characters in this film as real people. Though various computer generated scenes were to develop this film, two techniques such as angle and lighting were specifically needed to create life-like scenery and characters throughout the film. For example diverse lighting methods were necessary in order to help viewers decipher the mood of a particular scene or event. This can be seen as the family goes to Pizza Planet in which the claw game machine stands out from all the surrounding games due to its bright colors in dark game room. <br/><br/>Film angles were also used throughout the Toy Story film, for example when traveling in the Planet Pizza truck the two toys met up with three toy aliens hanging from the truck's rear view mirror. In this scene Woody and Buzz were viewing the aliens from an angle in which they appeared to be descending from the sky. In my opinion this was yet another example connected to the theme in which both Woody and Buzz had to overcome their prejudices and accept the differences of others in order to achieve a common goal. In my opinion lighting and angles were a significant part of the film's theme which is about how two toys, Woody and Buzz, were able to overlook each other's differences in order to achieve the common goal of safely getting back to their kid owner Andy. In the end this film did an excellent job at portraying computer- animated toys such as Woody and Buzz Lightyear in a humanized manner. Wonderful family movie!"

","Toy Story is a great movie for children and adults. Children will enjoy it simply because it is a cartoon. They will find it exciting because it shows toys coming to life which is something every child pretends with their toys. It's a good movie for children because it teaches them about jealousy, friendship, and teamwork. Adults will appreciate the animation and the accuracy of the details in the toys. Most of the toys used in this film were ones most people had as children. Such as, Mr. Potato head, the slinky dog, etch-a-sketch, and the army men. <br/><br/>The theme of Toy Story is friendship. The movies theme song was titled ""You've Got a Friend in Me"". The friendship in this movie is about overlooking insecurities and finding a true friend in someone that you think would be your biggest enemy. A 2001 movie called Monsters Inc. is directed around this same theme. A little girl named Boo should be afraid of the monsters as much as the monsters are afraid of her but they form a friendship that overcomes their differences. <br/><br/>Toy Story is about the lives of toys owned by a boy named Andy. Andy is having a birthday and he gets a new toy named Buzz Lightyear. Andy's toys worry about him getting new toys because they are afraid they will get lost or donated. With the arrival of Buzz, Woody fills that Andy will like Buzz better. He tries to lose Buzz but instead he accidentally knocks him out of a window. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were brilliantly matched for being the voices of Woody and Buzz Lightyear. The personalities of the actors and characters seemed to be a perfect fit. The other toys in the movie, Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky dog (Jim Varney), Pig named Ham(John Ratzenberger), Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), and Bo Peep(Annie Potts), feel like Woody did this on purpose because he was jealous of the attention Buzz was getting from Andy. In order to make things right Woody realizes he needs to get Buzz back. Woody and Buzz both wind up separated from Andy and this is where their adventure begins. From this point on they work together to get back to Andy's before his family moves. Along the way Buzz realizes that he is not a space ranger but a toy. Woody tries to help Buzz understand that he is not just a toy and that he is very important to children. Woody convinces Buzz that they must get back to Andy. At the conclusion of the movie, Buzz and Woody are helping each other make it on the moving truck. They finally make it next to Andy who is excited to see both of them. <br/><br/>Toy Story is about the friendship that is formed between Woody and Buzz. Once Woody was able to get passed his insecurities he realized that Andy could have two favorite toys. The motif of friendship is displayed throughout the movie by the relationships between Woody and Andy, Woody and all the other toys, and between Woody and Buzz. They also form a friendship with the strange toys at Sid's house. This movie is a true example of friendship."

","Pixar strikes out in feature films with its first full-lengther, and the results are stunning! They set the bar almost impossibly high for anyone else interested in getting into full length computer animation. But what made Toy Story have such staying power and make the characters immediately house-hold names wasn't so much the technical brilliance (although it did dazzle), but the storytelling. Okay, case in point. Independence Day. The media hyped this up and it got a lot of viewers. It had a lot of effects. It dazzled our eyes (not our hearts) on the big screen. It sold a lot of DVDs. It made a lot of money...during its run. So who remembers it much now? For that matter, who will remember much of just about any of Roland Emmerich's films years from now? But who can forget Woody, Andy, Buzz, etc.? Who can forget that bedroom? Who can forget Sid? The writers at Pixar took a great idea which was understanding how many of us (even as adults) have emotional attachments to our toys and found a way to bring the heart of that idea and nail it down to a heartwarming story about friendship. That the technical details are flat out amazing for its time was an added bonus (even seeing reflections from Buzz's space helmet -- they didn't have to do that! The animators threw that in just to make the experience all the more special and believable). No other studio has ever come up to the standard set by Pixar. Dreamworks hasn't, though they have made a good film or 2. Sony Pics hasn't, etc. etc. Because they lack a great story to begin with, and when they do land upon one, they muck it up by trying to make it something it isn't. I can almost hear the writers in their studios thinking, ""Well, this is good, but we need to add more adult jokes so that the parent's won't get bored."" Advice, just follow Pixar's example and let the story unfold as it needs to. Pixar got it right and has gotten it right up through Toy Story 3. I fear we may be in for a nadir of creativity as we move into Cars 2, but we'll see..."
"kdnor2011","10","0","0","5 September 2011"," Let me just say it...My favorite Animated movie
","I really like animation, just the idea that you can basically take any idea, and characters, and make them do anything you want. Now a days there are three major animation companies, Disney, Dreamworks, and Pixar, sure there are others, but they never make films as famous as these three. And of those three, without a doubt the best working today is Pixar, they revolutionized animation by creating the first CGI animated movie, and that's what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Toy Story is not the most complicated or mature animated film you'll ever see. It's a simple story of a cowboy doll named Woody, who is neglected by his owner Andy after he gets a Buzz Lightyear Action Figure. Then by some weird circumstance, they both end up in the home of Andy's neighbor Sid, who is basically what would happen if you put Hitler and Osama bin Laden together, made them a teenager, and turned Jews and Americans into Toys.<br/><br/>The animation is great, as the first fully CGI animated movie, it's beautiful to look at, but the characters are so engaging that you forget about the animation. And there are so many hilarious moments that any flaws with the film are forgivable. But really the only flaw I can see is that the humans look more like toys than the actual toys.<br/><br/>Everyone has their favorite animated movie, some have one of the films in the Disney Animated canon, some say one of Dreamworks movies, maybe even a Don Bluth or Blu Sky movie, or another Pixar flick, but my favorite animated movie is Toy Story, maybe it's just nostalgia, but it's still a wonderful film."

","With films like ""Toy Story"", I feel like I'm going out of my movie comfort zone somewhat, but then on the flip side, I think I'd like to be a kid forever. At least in spirit. You know, like the seniors in the old age home in the Twilight Zone episode 'Kick the Can'. There's a lot to like about this picture; part of it's the cool animation and creative voicing, part of it's the clever use of sight gags that young kids would have no idea about, like the Binford Tool Box and the Punisher logo on Sid's shirt. I guess it's good to be old enough to have that perspective.<br/><br/>With only nominal appearances by the 'humans' in the movie, the picture stayed true to it's mission of presenting Andy's toys as if they were living and thinking creatures. They had their own favorites, showed emotion, and helped teach the lesson of having a friend by being a friend. When things looked bleak in Sid's back yard, the misfit toys even managed to violate their own prime directive, that is, they allowed Sid to see they were 'real' in order to help Woody and Buzz. I wonder if Sid ever got over it.<br/><br/>I read a dozen or so of the other comments on the picture and no one mentioned Randy Newman in their reviews. I'm sure someone did, but let me add my voice to that minority. ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" is a perfect accompaniment to the picture, and fits it like a glove. Now that I see what I've missed with these animated films going back to ""Toy Story"", I'll have to hunt up a few more and kick that getting older can down the road a few more times."

","Toy Story is hands down the best animated film of all times. It's also a groundbreaking film with computer animation and it allowed more movie producers to explore the art.

He gets jealous when Andy gets a new toy, Buzz Lightyear. It only gets worse when both of them are missing and get stuck in evil Sid's room.<br/><br/>The voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are probably the best well-known voices in animated films.<br/><br/>The music by Randy Newman is fantastic.

","I've finally watched the 3 (so far) excellent Toy Story Pixar Disney films after hearing Mark Kermode recommend them on UK BBC as the BEST trilogy ever made, including the Godfathers. Well, who am I to argue with such a cinema expert? But he obviously doesn't remember the dashing Dick Barton!<br/><br/>#1 has the main toy characters of Woody and Buzz overcoming impossible odds to escape from the clutches of psychotic child toy killer Sid, #2 Woody from the clutches of psychotic toy collector Al, #3 Buzz and the gang from the clutches of psychotic toy Lotso. Throughout the individual films and the series as a continuous whole the characters, the character development, the cgi cartoonery, the comedy and the story are uniformly elegant and almost perfect. This is fast paced logically progressed stuff for kids to enjoy and adults to appreciate, and hopefully most of the relational morals will be taken on board by most people – apart from whether or not it's OK for someone to be portrayed as owning apparently live human beings and using them as toys of course! Do you empathise more with Andy the caring Owner or Woody the faithful Slave, or neither like me?<br/><br/>A personal yardstick I use for cartoons is Does the film look like the people who made the film had fun making it? With Toy Story 123 the answer is a resounding Yes – they were so full of fun and confident that even a cod Spanish reprise of Randy Newman's main song was included in 3. And that came after some surprising scenes of heartbreaking poignancy – containing Tom Hanks' finest ever performance. In an ever more populated genre getting ever more technologically advanced and intelligent this series remains magically simple, and simply the best of its kind. Great fun and very re-watchable."

","Having recently seen the truly outstanding Toy Story 3, I really wanted to go back and watch this film again. I haven't seen it in many years, but I remembered most of the scenes if not the exact detail and execution, and of course with an older eye I have a better appreciation for what's going on.<br/><br/>This is just about as good of a ""first computer animated film"" as could be hoped for. One thing I can say is that the humor, while not sophisticated or adult, is more intelligent than I remembered. It's a movie designed for a young audience, but the writers realized that as many adults will be watching its debut for the spectacle of computer animation, and it's clever for this group in a way that would fly over their children's' heads.<br/><br/>The plot line is simpler than I recalled, which is to be expected. One thing that surprised me is the relative one-dimensionality of the characters, especially when compared to Toy Story 2, which has been my mental standard for the characters for many years, and Toy Story 3. Woody is jealous but devoted, Buzz is delusional, Slinky is loyal, Mr. Potato Head is suspicious, etc. These aren't characters so much as they're adjectives. However, the voice actors do an all-around great job. I may just be saying that because I've known who Woody and Buzz are long before I knew who Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were. Ultimately, the simplicity of the characters matches the concise nature of the film.<br/><br/>In fact, having watched this again the best way I can think of to describe this movie is that it's basically a really long short film. Which is not at all to say that its plot is artificially stretched; quite the contrary. It's lean and compact like a short film is, it just happens to not be short.<br/><br/>All in all, watching this film again has lead me to believe that Toy Story 2 is underrated. Toy Story's sequel is understood by many to be an action-packed film appealing almost exclusively to kids, but that film was where some of the more mature themes that would be brought to their logical conclusion in Toy Story 3 first appeared. In addition, many of the characters, particularly Buzz, aren't nearly as fleshed out until the second one. Toy Story is a cartoon, but Toy Story 2 is an animated film, and that is the difference.<br/><br/>That said, this movie holds up very well and I will always hold it close to my heart. There are rarely more joyous moments in film than ""falling with style"
"hall895","8","0","0","8 September 2010"," The start of something big
","Nowadays people assume that when it comes to what they see up on the big screen computers make absolutely anything possible. If you can dream it you can see it with the assistance of a little computer wizardry. But of course that was not always the case. The computer animation revolution had to start somewhere and that somewhere was Toy Story. The animators at Pixar made the impossible possible. You watch the movie today and it's easy to take it for granted. You forget that Pixar was attempting something entirely new and that there were more than a few doubts as to whether it would work. Oh, it worked alright. It worked spectacularly. Director John Lasseter and his animation team created a visually stunning masterpiece the likes of which had never been seen before. Movie animation would never be the same, Toy Story changed everything.<br/><br/>The movie looks great but in order to be deemed a success there had to be a story to match the visuals. All the technological wizardry in the world would not have been able to hide a lousy story. Thankfully that proved to be no concern as we get a compelling and endearing storyline, one which provides plenty of opportunities for some good laughs as well. For as revolutionary as the animation was it is the story and the characters which ultimately make the movie so beloved. To infinity and beyond! Just saying it brings a smile to your face. The toys which are the stars of this story are great, memorable characters. Each is infused with its own unique personality. You can dismiss no toy as ""just a toy"". Each toy has its own story, its own life. All the voice actors deserve great credit for the work they did in making each toy stand out in its own way. Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear are of course the big stars and they both fit their roles perfectly. But whether playing a dog, a pig or a potato head each voice actor was uniformly terrific. R. Lee Ermey as a little green army man and Wallace Shawn as a Tyrannosaurus with serious anxiety issues are two personal favorites. So many characters which are so easy to embrace and each of whom is good for some laughs too. And there's even room for a great villain in Sid, the evil toy-destroying kid next door. A great cast of characters brought brilliantly to life by the great work of the animators and the voice cast.<br/><br/>Toy Story triumphs in making you feel for its characters. Who can't empathize with Woody as he fears being pushed aside by Buzz? Who hasn't had insecurities like Rex? Who can't understand Mr. Potato Head's longing for a Mrs. Potato Head? When the toys hurt you hurt, when they triumph you feel as if you shared in it. It's a movie guaranteed to put a smile on your face. If there's any complaint it might be that the movie, at a trim 80 minutes, isn't long enough. We want to spend more time with these toys. Of course we would get the opportunity to do so in sequels to come. But the original movie certainly stands on its own merits. It's a movie you can happily watch again and again. And when you do take the time to really look at the world the animation team created for these toys to inhabit. The level of detail in the backgrounds is just as stunning as the beautifully rendered main characters. No corners were cut in creating a world which looks truly lived in. A whole world magically brought to life. Toy Story was, in its time, unlike anything anyone had ever seen. And all these years later the magic is still there. It's a movie which will be discovered, and loved, by generations to come."
"brando647","8","0","0","10 August 2010"," Pixar First Feature is an Instant Classic
","Pixar's long line of success began in 1993 with TOY STORY, the first in a series of highly successful CG family films. Pixar had the formula nailed from the start, creating a fun kid's film with a powerful story capable of entertaining adults. In the film, we're introduced to the world of Andy's room when no one's around and the toys come to life. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is a classic cowboy doll complete with a pull-string vocal box and reigns as young Andy's favorite toy. For his birthday, Andy receives a flashy new Buzz Lightyear action figure (voiced by Tim Allen) and Woody must cope with the fact that he may have been bumped from the top position. A botched attempt at lodging Buzz behind Andy's desk throws Buzz out into the real world and Woody must bring him back to regain the trust of the other toys.<br/><br/>The fun of this kid's film lies in the characters. Allen is hilarious as Buzz and his inability to grasp that he's merely a child's toy and not an actual space ranger, spending half the film trying to return to Star Command; Hanks is a bit neurotic and totally high strung as Woody in his role as the toy-in-charge (going so far as to hold meetings on plastic erosion and establishing a buddy-system for moving day). The room is loaded with great supporting characters in the form of classic playthings from everyone's childhoods: a Slinky dog, a Mr. Potato Head, a piggy bankÂ…each with their own unique personalities. These characters are each fun enough to deserve their own movie and we're lucky to have been given the TOY STORY sequels to return to this world.<br/><br/>I really enjoy the film overall (as do just about everyone I know who's seen it) and there is little to complain about. It's amazing to see how well the animation stands up after so many years. You can see that the computer graphics aren't as smooth as modern CG, but it's still near seamless. Pixar's first film is a classic I was happy to introduce to my daughter."

"johnnyboyz","8","0","0","16 July 2010"," The sort of film that, when looking back over Dinsey's animation triumphs of decades ago, very much holds a case for a position in said canon.
","Amongst a lot of other things, 1995's Toy Story is a mixing of basic filmic conventions in the form of character arcs and genre demands blended with highly effective comedic content, all combined with a high concept into a piece thoroughly enjoyable and worthwhile. Its energy unmistakable; its inspiration unequalled and its charm unmatched, in what is a milestone in animation for reasons much more than the fact the computer generated imagery was as fresh as it was. Vaugely, the memory of seeing it for the first time many years ago stands in rather stark comparison to whatever I recall of the rest of that viewing when it was revealed Toy Story was to be, quite literally, about the toys and their coming to life so as to interact and engage with their surroundings. In starting in the manner it does, with a young boy named Andy animating his toys to as to bring them to life and interact with what's around them as it ran on whatever meek story he could come up with and not knowing a thing about the premise or indeed content, ignorantly, I led myself into believing the entire piece would be of this ilk; quite literally, a toy story about toys being what they are: inanimate objects being interacted with by a child. Imagine the sense of surprise mixed with awe and glee when Woody sits up in Andy's room and announces that ""the coast is clear!"" to the rest of the toys.<br/><br/>The film starts like one of those short cartoons you'd see before the beginning of a feature film, years ago. The opening is a diverting mini-narrative involving each of the main characters going through whatever motions a child can muster; the lead toy of whom is Woody (Hanks), a cowboy doll which is promptly taken downstairs and around the house as it's emphasised he is Andy's favourite, and has been for a while. I suppose what happens when they come alive might be read into as a deconstruction of these toys; that they are, indeed, so much more than just inanimate objects whom don't think nor feel, each of them coming alive once the humans have vacated then operating within said space; maintaining relationships and feeling an array of emotions such as fear, angst and lust. Some are friendlier than others; some more confident and some have certain elevated relationships with each other. Amongst them, Don Rickles' Potato Head doll; a wonderful creation of physical comedy whose detachable body parts are the source of persistently funny jokes. He's joined by a Slinky Dog (Varney); a green plastic dinosaur Rex (Shawn) and, curiously, Andy's piggy bank Hamm (Ratzenberger).<br/><br/>Interestingly, Andy's toys seem infused by true-to-life western iconographic imagery, or are indeed representative of 'type' in their attitudes. Rex is a dinosaur, thus feels the need to be able to scare people with his 'roar' for reasons that must be linked to the fact T-Rex dinosaurs from billions of years ago did exactly this. Somehow, Rex is aware of this. Likewise Andy's small toy soldiers, led by a sergeant voiced by R. Lee Ermey, are as militarian as you'd expect but is there a written rule that says they must show expertise in special ops and must behave in the military manner they do? Remember those grey plastic soldiers of similar size you could get? I guess they'd be equally militarily efficient but could speak in a German accent. I had some yellow soldiers of similar size once; God only knows how they'd sound. There can be no surprise that the toys of Syd (von Detten) cannot speak, due to their forced hybridising with other toys under said child's tortuous regime which sees heads and bodies swapped with other toys thus falsifying their image.<br/><br/>It can be no coincidence the two principal toy characters of the film are the two that most resemble human beings in their appearance, with Andy's other toys marginalised due to their animistic or unnatural characteristics. Woody's perfect existence is thrown into disarray by Buzz Lightyear (Allen), a spaceman toy Andy gets on his birthday; the revealing of the gift at the end of the present opening session starting this huge build up as to what Buzz is. Buzz's presence is an example of an item of a more futuristic; more science-fiction orientated nature coming into the house and taking over as older items are rendered more obsolete and therefore replaced thus rendering the issue one of a modernity driven nature, and is an item Toy Story 2 explored much more broadly in terms of genre replacing genre when toys of Woody's ilk are rendered nothing but mere museum pieces. But it is additionally representative of America's obsession with consumerism, in that I've no doubt Buzz is a part of a kind of franchise and Andy's gradual replacing of Woody posters/merchandise etc. This, as he and his mother occupy this blissfully suburban infused street which is systematic of the nation's own attitudes towards mass produced products.<br/><br/>Woody and Buzz's overall ultimatum is issued to us, out loud, by Woody when they are stranded at a petrol station: Andy's due to move house shortly and both need to get home, so a lot is at stake and tension runs persistently high. Buzz's own tale of realisation is effortlessly inter-cut with this plight, along the way learning of a new existence and garnering a new lease of life as their relationship feeds off a rather Hollywoodised 'buddy' combination no doubt inspired by American films of the 1980s through to the early 1990s of this ilk. Apart from pioneering your now token 'chase' finale, of which encompasses all the elements and is seen nearer the end of mostly every CG animated film made since (see 2002's Monsters Inc. or 2009's Up), Toy Story is a wonderfully made, supremely nourishing film that opens our eyes to a whole new world within our own and enthrals and entertains in equal measure."

It is complete harmless fun from start to finish, as we follow a group of toys that come to life when the owners are not around. All the characters are very well established, Woody is very layered with great depth and there is great development put in to Buzz Lightyear over the course of the film.<br/><br/>The humour in the film is terrific, a great balance between what children and what adults will find funny. It is clear that Pixar tried very hard to ensure this would be a movie that the entire family, people of all ages, can watch and enjoy.<br/><br/>The cast is phenomenal, Tom Hanks shines as Woody and truly embodies the emotions the character is undergoing. Tim Allen is also terrific as Buzz Lightyear and conveys the characters realisation of his reality brilliantly throughout, other highlights for me would be Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head and John Ratzenberger as Hamm. <br/><br/>It is a feel good movie and you will find it hard not to wipe the smile off your face from start to finish.

"daryl42-1","9","0","0","5 July 2010"," If it wasn't for Toy Story coming together so well, computer animation would have taken a step backwards.
","9.4<br/><br/>For years, Disney reigned as the superior animation studio. Although there were others creating animated feature length films, Disney has always been a household name, known for their experience and ability to create an emotional and entertaining experience out of hand-drawn images, and original, composed music. In 1995, Pixar Animation Studios released Toy Story. While it wasn't the first time that we've seen CGI, or Computer Generated Imagery, it was the first fully CGI film.<br/><br/>What a disaster this film could have been. And thank God that it wasn't. If it was, then it would have done more damage to CGI animation than otherwise. The film was distributed by Disney, but created by Pixar. It had no musicals. No frames were hand drawn, everything was done by computer. It had a lot to live up to. Sticking the Disney name on the film meant that audiences expected not a single drop of mediocrity out of it. Thankfully, as we all know, Toy Story was a success.<br/><br/>The animation in the film isn't the augmented reality kind. CGI effects aren't added to real life shots, everything is animated. This gives the film some room to breathe. The lighting, surfaces and other effects all look good, in their own context. It would have been a huge step backwards for computer animation if Toy Story didn't come together so well, and successfully put up that fourth wall.<br/><br/>But besides the animation, what brings to film to life is the voice- acting, story, and presentation. It's a story about toys who are conscious and self-aware. However, they all follow a strict code, where they do not allow humans to know of their life and intelligence. It's not an epic tale. Two toys are lost and have to get back home. But what carries the film are the characters. Every toy has a distinct personality, and the voice actors are great in their roles. This is one of the strong points in Toy Story.<br/><br/>The film's presentation is great, too. It went totally contradictory of what Disney means to people. There are no musicals, but the music, although used sparingly, has a great effect nonetheless. The direction is of the more typical Hollywood style, and different from the typical Disney movie. It is entertaining to exist in the toys' world, and when they venture off a couple of blocks, you feel like you have traveled a long distance. <br/><br/>Toy Story could have been such a disaster. If it wasn't for everything coming together so well, especially the animation, characters and voice acting, computer animation would have taken a step backwards. Its greatest strength are the toys. They are amongst the better characters in film. Toy Story not only proved that animated films can be done in a different formula than the already great Disney one, but that computer animation was here to stay. It was a pleasure to the eyes, and a pleasure to the Andy inside all of us."
"Robert_duder","10","0","0","4 July 2010"," My 900th review...perhaps the most amazing piece of animation in history....
","I think it is a pretty common conception that Toy Story revolutionized animation. Pixar's first release jump started the animation craze that has lasted nearly two decades and still going strong and gave birth to some of the biggest films of the last 15 years. So it should have been an easy choice for my 900th review with Toy Story craze back on with the new and equally as amazing third installment. Toy Story brings to life some of the greatest characters in film history. You will fall in love with all the characters within the first 15 minutes and makes every step of their fantastical adventure even more captivating. The adventure they go on when you look at it from a truth standpoint is no more than 'down the street' and back but when you're a 3-6 inch toy that changes everything and that is truly the brilliance of Toy Story. You will become one of these toys, their world is so real to you and you see everything from their perspective. Every single person on the planet had toys of one kind of another whether it be a stuffed teddy or a stick and watching Toy Story will make you fondly remember your childhood and look at every inanimate object we love in a different light.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is Woody. No one could ever take that away from him as is the case with many of the toys. Hanks is the soul of the good hearted, compassionate and brave toy cowboy. His voice is so incredibly animated and excited and just absolutely perfect. Tim Allen is as good as Hanks playing the role of everyone's favourite space toy Buzz Lightyear. The chemistry the film makers create between Buzz and Woody is phenomenal and probably one of the biggest reasons Toy Story remains so successful. If I could spend time on each and every voice actor in this film I would because this is without a doubt thee BEST voice acting cast in animation history. Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn (my personal favourite Rex), John Ratzenberger (simply amazing), and to a lesser extent but still amazing Annie Potts, John Morris (who was Andy in all three films spanning 15 years), Laurie Metcalf and the incredibly versatile character actor R. Lee Ermey. This entire cast created animation history. You will not find a better cast and considering they are all behind the scenes voicing fictional characters that is impressive.<br/><br/>Director John Lasseter is not new to animation although Toy Story will certainly be considered his piece de resistance for certain. He has worked in various capacity on dozens of amazing Disney features but he obviously knows his characters, he obviously knows Disney and he obviously is in touch with the little child inside himself and all of us. Best of all Toy Story holds no punches. I would even hesitate to allow my young, young children to see the film before they were ready because there is truly some terrifying scenes in the film and some really creepy characters. Sid and his torturing of toys, and his rag tag band of creepy toy outcasts are downright creepy and make the story even more incredibly but could certainly creep out little children but the happy ending and the bright world of Andy's room and knowing that the Toys will win in the end brings everything together. If you hate cartoons, if you have never seen Toy Story you are short changing yourself because this film will make you realize animation is not your grand daddy's cartoons anymore. A brilliant amazing film that is probably one of the best ever made. 10/10 <br/><br/>THANKS FOR STICKING WITH ME THROUGH 900 REVIEWS AND ON TO 1000!! 901 and 902 WILL BE TOY STORY 2 AND 3 RESPECTIVELY. Read on!!"

It was the first such film to be completely computer-generated, and fully exploited this technological advance to the maximum to tell its tale with great humour and conviction.

","Toy Story is a timeless classic. Probably the most genuine, innocent, simplistic yet powerful attempt to create a children film which appeals both adults and kids alike.<br/><br/>It is the story of how two rival 'living' toys - a old western cowboy toy (Woody) and action figure of a space commander (Buzz Lightyear) become best friends under some dangerous circumstances. There are bunch of numerals toys like Mr. Potato, a Barbie, a magnifying toy, a truck, alien toys and many more.<br/><br/>The film is crafted so well that within some few minutes of the film, you are intrigued to it. It is a fascinating film, with amazing characterization. The toys are so believable that you feel close to them. You feel cherished when Allan and his company make a spoiled brat kid Sid (who loves blowing up toys) realize how important is to save toys which bring back the memories of childhood.<br/><br/>I must say the script is effortless and very well written. Music by Randy Newman is also great. One striking thing in this film are its sound effects and CGI which are considered ground-breaking for a 1995 film.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is highly recommended. Not only for children, but for everyone who love cherishing the childhood memories - the lovely Toys."

","Today, I enjoy Toy Story (John Lasseter, 1995) a lot more than when I was a kid, which might be a criticism. The plot revolves around cherished sheriff toy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), who's tossed over by Andy in favour of shiny new space ranger Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). Buzz, meanwhile, is convinced he's the saviour of the galaxy, as opposed to just being a toy. It's on a smaller scale than later Pixar efforts, and of course digital animation has developed a lot in the past 15 years, but it's very well done, with appealing characters, clever jokes - including a great recurring gag about Woody being a murderer - and a lot of heart, reinforced by Randy Newman's lovely song score. One complaint: as Lasseter points out on the DVD, Woody's monologue in Sid's room, perhaps the best scene in the film, shouldn't have been trimmed. The extended scene is even better."

Tom Hanks delivers a believable character in Woody, and this is clearly some of Tim Allen's best work in his career, if not his BEST, he often just plays boring frustrated dad characters, it gets really old, and he doesn't have any energy, but his voice works as Buzz Lightyear. Altogether the movie is funny, the story's well crafted, enjoyable to watch over and over again. Very much advised to watch this over the much overrated The Incredibles, this one's actually great.

Surrounded by a colourful cast of characters - such as the cynical Mr. Potato Head, the wisecracking Piggy bank Hamm and Woody's brown-nosing second-in-command Slinky Dog - Woody seems something of a king. However, when a new toy arrives on the scene-a high tech spaceman action figure named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Woody suddenly loses his popularity. But this toy comes with a surreal extra feature - he thinks he's the real Buzz Lightyear!! In the effort of removing Buzz as Andy's favourite toy-both toys are swept out of their home, and into the outside world where they unite reluctantly in friendship for an adventure home."

","When this initial computer animated movie first came out in November of 1995, I was stoked to watch this especially after watching a little behind the scenes short about it at Walt Disney World and besides, my birthday was near. What a wonderful experience what with the funny moments as well as touching ones and some intense ones concerning that sadistic kid Sid. And the use of many established comic talents like Don Rickles, Annie Potts, John Ratzenberger (who would become a regular Pixar voice), the late Jim Varney, and especially, Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear. And as with previous Disney animated features, Randy Newman provides such an enjoyably compelling music score as well as several enjoyable songs with a great theme song in ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" that he warbled with Lyle Lovett. And the recent 3-D version just adds to the experience! So while this and Toy Story 2 is still (in its fourth week) playing as a double feature in theatres (with an entertaining 10-minute intermission of trivia and many other extras), I recommend you rush to the next showing as soon as you can!"

The plot is actually really inventive and the idea of toys being jealous of one another is really fun.<br/><br/>I think this movie is perfect for people of any age because the humor can be enjoyed by anyone.

","I'm going to re-watch all the pixar movies before I watch ""Up"", and of-course I figured I should start with the original pioneer ""Toy Story"". It's still as brilliant as ever. Sure, the animation may be dated some (especially on a VHS tape, which is what I just watched), but the story is time-less. I don't care what anyone says, the concept of toys coming to life is beyond awesome. This movie mesmerized me as a kid, and still does today. It's just so perfectly paced and brilliantly written that I don't see how anyone, girl or guy, kid or adult could possibly not enjoy this. This film still gets an easy 10/10 from me. Next up is going to be A Bugs Life and Toy Story 2 (both favorites of mine, though Toy Story 2 was always the only other pixar movie besides the original that I considered a masterpiece). Hopefully both hold up as well as the original Toy Story does (and I think they both will, especially TS2)."

","I told a friend I was going to re-watch 'Toy Story' in the theater due to it being a ""classic"" in which he immediately disputed. I disagree. Much like 1977's 'Star Wars' or 'Citizen Kane,' 'Toy Story' was far before it's time and revolutionized it's genre, in this case: animation. In addition, they took it to the next level with creativity, a perfect combination of humor for both kids and adults as well as an excellent homage to toys people around my age grew up with. I was at the tail-end to some of the toys shown or in the middle when I was a child. So, of course, a great deal of smiles were on my face throughout in remembrance. But, as a movie-lover/amateur critic, it has to go beyond that. I won't like a movie without a great and original script/dialogue, deep characters, good pacing and surprises. This movie has them all. I loved the lines, the voices were pitch perfect, the adventure made up from just from imagination was inventive from minute one and all characters intersected beautifully. Just as child Andy's birthday party is to start, every toy (alive when no one else is around) is worried they'll be replaced and current head-toy cowboy Woody attempts to convince them otherwise. Unfortunately, it is he that's replaced by Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear (love the variances to his name, including ""Light-beer"") who seemingly doesn't know he is anything but an astronaut. Not too far deep into the story is a touching realization/awakening for both and great learning for the people watching, kids and adults alike. Excellent movie, perfect start for the apparently unbeatable Pixar studios and suitable for all ages. (Side note: 2009's 3-D version worth watching, but adds little to the already masterpiece it is.)"

","Please note that I am writing this review having watched the re-release of Toy Story in 3D.<br/><br/>If you're reading this you're probably interested in reading what people have to say about the film rather than looking for advice on whether or not to watch it; Toy Story is a highly popular film/franchise and I'm sure that describing the plot would be a pointless exercise. What I do want to describe, however, is the amazing artistic quality of this film that is now roughly fifteen years old at the time of me writing this review. The first feature length animated film, upon its release Toy Story didn't settle for this title; rather, it made its own legacy and is still now perhaps one of the greatest animated films ever made.<br/><br/>In Toy Story, it seems that Pixar don't miss a trick; there are gags on gags in all manners, from visual jokes and easter eggs to the wit of the dialogue. These characters, these toys, really do feel human. The themes the film deals with, the most prominent being jealousy, are conveyed through the toys in Andy's room as if Toy Story were a live action drama. We all can relate to the core concept of the film; which of us didn't imagine our toys coming to life like this when we were younger?<br/><br/>Watching Toy Story in 3D shows that despite this new technology where we can watch the latest releases in eye-popping 3D, a film will always be as enjoyable in the standard two dimensions if it as well made as Toy Story. Yes, the 3D was highly enjoyable, especially given that the film was not produced with 3D effects in mind; but I could sit at home watching Toy Story on any screen, in any number of dimensions, and feel just as immersed.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Imagine a different world when humans left the room. Toys come to life from the toy box, and the leader of the group is Andy's favorite toy, a cowboy doll with a pull string named Woody, voice of Tom Hanks. His owner Andy, voice of John Morris, has a birthday party and finds a new favorite toy named Buzz Lightyear, voice of Tim Allen. The other toys quickly become impressed by this new toy and claim him as their new leader, leaving Woody jealous of Buzz. In an attempt to get rid of Buzz for good, Woody soon finds that his plan backfires. Instead, Woody and Buzz end up in the real world with a long adventure ahead of them as they try to get back home before Andy's family moves away.<br/><br/>Woody and Buzz don't get along, but they must figure out a way to work together to get home safely. They realize the only way to get home is if they help each other instead of ignore or hurt each other. When Woody begins to help Buzz, they slowly find out they are becoming friends. Now they would willingly help each other in order to get back home to Andy. This shows the importance of friendship and the positive effects of having a good friend. No matter what, they will be there to save you if you need saving.<br/><br/>""Toy Story"" was the first film to be completely created by computers. This set the stage for all children's movies coming out now that are entirely computer animated. The toys and people they create actually look real compared to all animated movies being released at the time. It's amazing to see such deep expression on the characters' faces. The film was very upbeat and sent an easy message for children to grasp. Even the humor made children and adults alike want to see this film. This was one of my favorite movies as a child and still is today.<br/><br/>As a child, I always wondered if toys came to life, and when I saw this movie I believed it was true. I wished that I had a Woody or a Buzz Lightyear doll. I even wished that my Mr. Potato Head would talk back to me, even though that might be a little scary- it would be cool. I liked the personality that each toy had. I didn't really understand the concept of the movie was revolving around friendship, but I loved the new way they were starting to make movies. It led to so many more movies that I loved like A ""Bug's Life"" and ""Shrek."""

I mean it wasn't good as when I first saw it when it came out when I was in elementary school, but it was still pretty entertaining and brought back some memories. The animation was amazing, and phenomenal when it first came out and still holds up today. The voice actors even did a great job, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen did a great job with there performance in portraying Woody and Buzz Lightyear. It was a exciting adventure, although the plot was simple it was effective and entertaining.The story is about toys coming to life, but keeping themselves secret by acting like they aren't alive. But the toys coexist with humans peacefully, except the toys in Andy's room get worried on birthdays and Christmases of being replaced. Thus when Andy's favorite toy get replaced by a new favorite toy, the conflict starts from there when the older toy that was Andy's favorite tries to hide the new toy, but ends up hitting it out the window. Although this day and age, kid's who are about Andy' age probably won't play with the types of toys portrayed in the movie, and the magic was sort of lost from when I saw it when I was in elementary. This movie is still ahead of it's time, by a large margin.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

Only the detail suffers by comparison with current computer animated films, but that is perhaps only to be expected.<br/><br/>I was surprised and delighted to note Joss Whedon at the top of the list of those responsible for the screenplay - his name means a lot more to me now than it did 10 years ago.<br/><br/>This 3D retooling is interesting. For one thing, it demonstrates that it is a relatively easy exercise for CGI animated features. Having said that, it doesn't add an awful lot to Toy Story. Given that the film wasn't envisaged as a 3D feature, there aren't any sequences specifically designed to showcase 3D. The climactic chase and rocket scene works well, and there are scattered moments which make you go, ""Oh, look!"" But nothing which makes you go ""Wow!"" In the way the trailer (created specially for this 3D version) did.<br/><br/>But watching Toy Story, 2D or 3D, is never a waste of time - it's that good."

It was hilarious how Buzz believed he was a ""space ranger"". Also, Woody and Buzz sort of reminded me of Tawni and Sonny from the show Sonny With a Chance when they first met. Both Buzz and Sonny were ""the new kid"" who got accepted by almost everyone, and both Woody and Tawni were the only one who didn't accept the ""new kid"" and got jealous (but eventually learned to accept the ""new kid"").

"DavidSim240183","9","0","0","11 June 2009"," Where Pixar's legacy begins
","Before they became the trailblazers of computer animation, Pixar eked out a meagre existence as a small, independent company, forced to provide computer visual effects for other studios just to pay the bills. Although it seems impossible now, there was a time when Pixar hinged on the brink of bankruptcy on a daily basis. And the idea of creating a fully, computer animated feature film seemed a far off, distant fantasy.<br/><br/>After producing several highly acclaimed short films, Pixar's dream of making a full proper feature came to fruition when they entered into a partnership with Disney that still continues today. Thanks to some generous investors, a real team effort and a wing and a prayer, Pixar got the go-ahead on their debut feature, Toy Story.<br/><br/>Toy Story is where the Pixar legacy begins. It was the first of its kind and a huge success. Despite all of the doubts and preconceptions, they had pulled it out of the bag and Pixar's name was made. They created an entire revolution in animation. One that had never been seen before.<br/><br/>But it took a lot to go through to get there. Toy Story had a tumultuous history before it even made it to the big screen. According to the excellent documentary The Pixar Story, the script went through numerous rewrites, particularly with Woody's character. In Pixar's own words, Woody was becoming ""the most repellent thing you've ever seen"". The film just wasn't working. It was cynical. Sarcastic. It wasn't funny at all. And it wasn't the film John Lasseter imagined when he originated it.<br/><br/>With all that in mind, its all the more surprising how good it turned out to be. Toy Story has all of the qualities we've come to expect from the best of Pixar's work. Its confident. Its witty. It moves at a gallop and its intelligent too. Its one thing to make a whole new kind of film. Its another to make it work well.<br/><br/>The plot is a quite familiar one - toys that come to life when no-one's around. But Pixar put some fascinating spins on that one sentence synopsis thanks to some well etched characters, a fabulous script penned by a great team of writers, a charming musical score and fluid animation. Woody and Buzz Lightyear have become two of Pixar's much beloved creations. With Woody being such a jerk in the early days of Toy Story's conception, it may explain why Pixar brought in Hollywood's Nicest Guy Tom Hanks to voice him.<br/><br/>Some of Woody's character flaws have still made it into the film. But that may be one of the reasons why people were so drawn to it. Because he's not so squeaky clean compared with Disney heroes. A pull-string cowboy doll, the king of his mountain, when his owner Andy gets Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger action figure, and winds up cast aside, he goes mad with envy. He's as flawed as any flesh and blood person. A little selfish too. But not so much that he's irredeemable (which he almost wound up as in the early drafts).<br/><br/>But Buzz Lightyear is an even better character. He's a true original. Because unlike all the other toys around him, he doesn't know he is one. He believes he's a real space ranger. And the film is clever the way it wittily plays into Buzz's delusions about himself. He's so convinced of what he is that its a genuinely crushing moment when Buzz finds out the truth (a nicely played scene when he watches a Buzz Lightyear TV commercial).<br/><br/>Pixar always have a knack for matching the right actors to their characters. And Tim Allen is a perfect Buzz Lightyear. He captures the right blend of cocky bravado and self-righteous intent that the character so desperately needs to endear. Unlike all the other companies quick to jump on the CGI animation bandwagon, Pixar don't pick big name actors to ensure box-office success. They choose the right people to bring their characters to life.<br/><br/>The animation in Toy Story could seem primitive now when compared to the dazzling backdrops of Finding Nemo or Wall-E. The backgrounds are not as detailed and even the climax is not that lavish (Pixar didn't yet have a limitless budget to command) but they don't really need to be because its story is enough of a hook to enthrall us. <br/><br/>One thing they could have done without though is showing us the faces of the human characters. They tend to look too unreal when computer animated. Pixar hadn't quite got the hang yet of making a human face look natural. Not until The Incredibles anyway.<br/><br/>But these are only minor quibbles. In all other regards, Toy Story is a delight. Even at this early stage, Pixar has the formula down perfectly that gets them through each and every one of their films. Great characters, shrewd intelligence, genuine heart and a real sense of fun and adventure. Toy Story 2 is even better. It ups all the good things about this by a quantum factor. A great start for a superb studio.<br/><br/>To Infinity and Beyond!"

I watched it again recently and despite my age was pissing myself with laughter. This is mainly down to the characters who are so fresh. The banter between woody and Buzz is terrific (""YOU ARE A TOY!!!"") and the other characters are also brilliant, especially ,for me, the bitter, angry and cynical Mr potato head , who lends a slightly darker more adult edge to this film compared to the Pixar movies to come ,as well as Sid his dog and the mutilated toys he has created. It is after all the only pixar movie rated parental guidance, i think which lets the emotions of the characters be more human in the shape of jealousy, pride and competitiveness. The central ideas of toys being alive when you cant see them is probably their best idea to date just in sheer amount of imagination and the amount of opportunity and possibility it creates (their is after all a sequel) and does kind of become a template for later. This definitely provided a lifeline for Disney who had seriously passed its golden age, and were starting to lose their reputation of quality and connection with its younger and older audience. With Lasseter moving to head of creative output at Disney, hopefully he will put them back on track also.<br/><br/>(By the way I noticed a lack of any fathers in it, I don't know if thats meant to be read into)"

The characters including woody(Tom Hanks) and 'Buzz Light year' (famous cartoon character) were voiced perfectly. Some emotional turns with Buzz who believes that he really is a 'space ranger'. The Disney people's art work is different, creative and innovative and making standards in animation films.<br/><br/>Disfiguring a toy is a behavior we can see in many children. I don't know about any reasons why some kids like it. On any account, the film just eases that mind, encourages confidence even if you are just a 'toy', and coordinating as a team.

For the person who thought up the idea of toys coming to life, thank you. You have given this world an imaginative theory, which will be with us every time we leave the room.<br/><br/>Though everything about this film is exquisite, the ideology of living toys makes it what it is. When we first see Woody get up off the bed we need to blink a couple of times to make sure its real. Of course with modern technology CGI is hard not to use and this film was one of the first that was used effectively and though has now lost its significance. Nothing is lost in terms of the story however and the visuals and the finest direction Pixar ever achieved until Wall-E help create a warm fun family film. Will any other company beat Pixar on the animation stage? Shrek, Kung Fu Panda and Madagascar, though all good, don't have that extra depth and sophistication Pixar creates so easily.<br/><br/>Filled with great laughs and a suspense adventure, Toy Story is a sit down and enjoyable movie for the whole family. But then it is so much more than a movie.<br/><br/>Every Pixar movie has a message. Wall-E provided an insight into loneliness and the good of man kind, Monsters Inc told the tale of children's fairy tales and Cars reflects doing something for others.<br/><br/>This 1995 hit preaches to its audience through its characters. Woody's jealousy at being replaced and his suffering are almost tear worthy. We have all had our favourite toys and replaced them and this simple message will trigger something deep down inside any viewer. Buzz's commitment to who he really is and his strong beliefs are great in shaping his character and preaching to viewers to believe who they really are.<br/><br/>Most importantly though is friendship and how important it can be to get someone out of trouble for the good of someone else. This message is further emphasised through the best Pixar song of all time, ""You've got a friend in me"" Always consistent, always funny and always entertaining, Toy Story is a fun family film that will forever be remembered for its strong messages, entertainment and animation."

","I just watched this movie for the first time since I was 12 (I'm 24 now). A lot of times when I view films I liked as a child, my perspective as an adult changes, by either noticing how little effort was put into certain films, or just that storyline/quality isn't there.<br/><br/>Toy Story does not do this. As the first fully CG film, the detail I must say is fantastic and quite smooth. There is subtle adult humor in there that no child will be able to pick up, which makes this a great family flick, since both adults and children can enjoy it.<br/><br/>The plot is original and quite interesting. And too anybody who ever lost a ""Toy"" as a child, sometimes you may wonder, if they got up on their own and walked away.<br/><br/>It's sad that now and days, family films/kids films don't focus as much on story and dilogue like they used too and things just become a jumbled mess or completely juvenile. This film has quality story, dilogue and voice acting.<br/><br/>And unlike a lot of other Disney movies which portray violence and some direct indendendo, this takes a lighter comedic side and it's a refreshing change from some films prior to it and even things made till this day.<br/><br/>With that it also displays human emotions (Exaggerated of course for what they toys are feeling) But none the less, displays the essence of feeling replaced, or trying to be something you want to be,without having the means to do so.<br/><br/>I highly reccemmend this to anybody who hasn't seen it yet. If you're and adult, don't be turned off by the CG animation. It's not by any means like a cartoon."

","I'll admit I'm probably not old enough or this film wasn't released long enough to say this. But if I don't sat it now it'll never be written (by me anyway, I do everything on a whim). This film brings back so many memories from my childhood. Getting my Woodie Talking doll, My plastic Buzz. This film has everything, comedy, adventure, romance, more comedy, it's a perfect family film that I cannot help but watch whenever I see it on TV. The cast list for the voice overs shows that this had potential to be a great film, but it will be a great film for years to come. Great re-watch value. I don't like containing spoilers so I haven't added any. Please Please watch this at least once! =] In summary. Every child, teen, and adult should watch this movie at least one! 10/10"

When, the toy soldiers go to spy, to see the new toys, that scene is totally cool and thrilling. Sid looks like a pucca villain. Amongst the toys in Andy's room, Rex was very funny.

"walkerminot23","10","0","0","28 November 2008"," The Beginning of a New Era of Animation
","The movie that started it all. With computers that is. Toy Story is the first and best of an incredible list of movies courtesy of Pixar animation studios. A technology began with Walt Disney and Snow White in 1937 lives on today.<br/><br/>The pure genius of this movie can be attributed to many things, the great and original plot, the great voices, and the computerized process. However I believe that the beauty of this movie stands first and foremost. The settings are all completely perfect and they set the tone for all the previously mentioned details.<br/><br/>The story begins with a world surely all of us have imagined, do our toys walk and talk and have adventures of their own when we're not watching? Surely all of us have sworn to have found this toy in a different place than where we put it down? That concept alone is all you would need to get me to watch the movie. But there's much more than that, the characters are excellently crafted, there's Woody, everyone's favorite cowboy who's at the top of the toy bin, his world is a paradise and it seems nothing can disrupt it. In swoops Buzz Lightyear in his ""stupid little cardboard spaceship."" Buzz is a ""cool"" toy with gadgets, a laser, and the belief that he is on a secret mission assigned to him by Star Command critical to the survival of the universe. Buzz takes Woody's spot as the favorite toy, and Woody's animosity is total while all the other rooms toys are enthralled with Buzz.<br/><br/>This lays the groundwork for a great story centered on two great characters, Woody and Buzz. The supporting cast is excellent, with perfect goofy voices and actions. I will not delve into which famous actor plays each voice (you'll probably be able to guess from watching) in order to think of the toys as their own characters rather than the voices who play them.<br/><br/>To sum up: this movie started the tide of some of the greatest kids movies ever and its place at the pinnacle is well deserved."
"blippster","8","0","0","24 November 2008"," A marvellous feat of CGI
","Toy Story is a brilliant feat in the world of animated film, and was successful at the box office and well received by critics. The films success spawned a sequel in 1999 and a second sequel is to be released in 2010.<br/><br/>The story is about the cowboy doll Woody who is the favourite toy of a boy named Andy. Woody and the rest of Andy's toys all live together in Andy's bedroom, but Woody is the only one who is allowed to sleep in Andy's bed. Woody's position feels threatened when Andy receives a new action figure, an astronaut Buzz Lightyear, for his birthday. Because of Buzz Lightyear's fancy special features, Buzz replaces Woody as 'favourite toy'. Woody grows more and more jealous as the other toys accept Buzz into their community, and see him as some kind of leader because of his special features. When Andy decides to take Buzz on a family outing and not Woody, Woody feels offended. For revenge, Woody tries to trap Buzz behind a desk so that Andy will be forced to take Woody instead. However, Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out of the window, and the other toys see this as an attempt to murder Buzz. Woody is ostracised by the other toys. Woody does get taken on the family outing with Andy but unbeknownst to him, Buzz hops aboard the car as it leaves. During the outing, Buzz and Woody both become separated from Andy, who accidentally leaves them behind when he goes back home. Buzz and Woody must put aside their differences and work together if there is any chance of getting back home.<br/><br/>The animation of Toy Story is very impressive. The animators use very effective cinematic techniques that make you feel as though you are watching a live-action film rather than an animation. Toy Story was ground-breaking as this level of entirely CGI animation in a film had never been done before, and CGI in films had only started being used widely a few years earlier. The characters of Toy Story act and move like real people, and give the impression of having realistic weight. The animators get the effect of light with precision, and the animation barely feels out dated at all; modern animation do not necessarily seem any more advanced than this film. Unlike cartoons such as The Simpsons, the characters of Toy Story are based on human features. They move about as though they have the same body parts as humans.<br/><br/>Toy Story is a brilliant film in my opinion. It works on many levels so it can appeal to all people aged between 3 and 90. As far as its animation, it was absolutely brilliant for its time, and, as I said earlier, holds up very well today. The story is sharp and entertaining, full of hilarity, from toilet humour to dry wit; anyone will be able to find something funny about this film. The characters are also very lovable and the viewer feels attached to them in the first few minutes. I would definitely give this film a good four stars out of five. This film will surely last to infinityÂ…and BEYOND!"

","Toy Story fashions an existence as its characters know it out of a couple of young kids' bedrooms, a gas station, and an expanse of suburban freeway. It also enters an arcade- restaurant that recaptures that consumerist wonder of being a kid surrounded by video games and pizza. Its heroes are toys, which come to life when nobody is watching. Its conflict is between an old-fashioned cowboy doll who has always been an 8-year-old boy's favorite toy, the effective leader of the kid's toys as a collective community, and the new action figure who is starting to take his place. The villain is the grungy kid next door who takes toys apart and puts them back together again in morbid mishmashes, that is when he's not blowing them with fireworks. And the result is an emotional roller-coaster of a movie experience that does not diminish with age.<br/><br/>For kids, a movie like this works immaculately because it tells a fun story that presumably exists already somewhere in their minds when they are playing with their own toys. They can relate very deeply to these toy characters because of the role toys play in their lives. Older viewers can be even more immersed, because you find that after all these years, you still have such emotion invested in these toys. When Woody peeks from the toy chest at his boy, Andy, sleeping with Buzz Lightyear in his arms, I am truly touched. If you saw this as a kid and haven't seen it since, feeling you have outgrown it, you must revisit it, for you will discover quite the contrary.<br/><br/>In a way, it could have been even more interesting and rewarding to have been your parents' age in 1995 when the film emerged as the first film animated entirely by computer. To us as kids, visual nuance was the last thing on our minds. The most rudimentary elements of the cinematic experience were all that mattered to us, and we were transported. Now, we are completely accustomed to Pixar's series of family films that transcend what one normally perceives as the cornball throwaway inanity of so many of them.<br/><br/>John Lasseter opens the film in the---let's face it---spoiled 8-year-old's bedroom, where the toys come to life when their owner is gone. Each of the toy characters is rich and detailed. The playroom cunningly figures in well-known toys from real life, which may be product placement, but who cares when it functions as a great way for us to relate that much more with these characters by means of direct familiarity."

","Disney and Pixar team up to create Disney's first full-length computer animated cinematic masterpiece, Toy story. Made in 1995, Toy Story was a marking point in movie history not only for its computer animation, but also having a timeless story full of witty characters and adventures.<br/><br/>Toy Story is set in a suburban like neighborhood following an ensemble group of toys. Toys have human like abilities and personalities, but are forced to hide them from their human companions for the sake of being a toy. The main group of toys include a cowboy action figure, a piggy bank, a plastic dinosaur, a Mr. Potato Head as well as many more, all of whom live under their owner, Andy. The movie opens with Andy's birthday, which means receiving new toys to accompany old ones. Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, is Andy's favorite action figure and also the group's leader. Woody and his fellow toy friends are somewhat threatened but also enthralled by this event. After a short time of announcing what Andy received, the toys are relieved to find that Andy did not receive any new toys. They were in for a surprise. Little did they know that there was a surprise toy on Andy's bed. It was the newest and coolest toy on the market, Buzz Light-year, a space orientated action figure voiced by Tim Allen who turns out to be Andy's next favorite toy. The strange thing about Buzz is that he believes that he is an actual space alien fighter. The toys try to convince Buzz that he is a mere toy only to be favored by Andy. Since Buzz believes he is actually a space fighter this leads into leaving the house and begin his journey to outer space. This ultimately pursues Woody to go and save his rival while getting tied up in a wacky adventure.<br/><br/>There is a reason why this film acquired nineteen awards and ten nominations. Both adults and children will be entertained with the concept of living toys. The plot of the movie is really where it shines. There isn't one point in Toy Story where the plot gets boring or dragged out. People at Disney's Pixar developed the characters so well that it makes you understand how characters behave. Also, with a movie with so many diverse characters the audience is bound to find someone relate to. The only downside about seeing this movie is its length. It is around eighty minutes but it seems like the movie is about two hours, but that doesn't mean it isn't a full price movie because it is absolutely worth your time. Toy Story is definitely recommended to all families and especially kids. As for everyone else as an audience, I would recommend the movie if you would like to revisit your child hood or if you just want to see a beautifully animated movie. Whoever the audience may be, Toy Story will put a smile on your face.<br/><br/>Toy Story is a classic beyond all means. It has stunning visuals, a crazy plot, deep character development, and most importantly it brings people back to a time when nothing mattered except toys. The most inspiring aspect of the movie is the moral of friendship. It really teaches people that they can't get anywhere in life without companionship. Toy Story also really captured the thought of ""what if toys were alive"" and executed it in a witty way. This movie will definitely be playing on family TV screens till ""Infinity and Beyond""!"
"SonicBoom77","10","0","0","28 May 2008"," A timeless classic.
","Toy Story is truly a groundbreaking film. The animations are amazing and the story and these characters are so lovable,humorous and just flawless no matter how many time you have watched it. Woody and Buzz beat a giant ogre and a talking donkey any day of the week. The animations on the film inspired movies like The Incredibles, Shrek,Finding Memo and others. Toy Story's plot is about a boy named Andy whose playing with his toys, such as a Mr. Potato Head, Rex, and his favorite toy, Woody. He takes Woody into the living room and plays with him some more, where he learns Andy has planned his birthday a few days early, as himself, his mother, and his sister Molly will be moving. Woody gets put back in the room, and when Andy leaves, he's revealed to be the leader of the toys, and orders them to be prepared for the party. All the toys work together, aware that new toys could mean the replacement of current ones, but Woody keeps them calm. After Andy goes through all his presents, he's surprised by one last present from his mother. The present is revealed to be a new must-have Buzz Lightyear toy.<br/><br/>They all return to their places as Andy and his friends come running up to Andy's room. When they all run out, the toys approach the Buzz Lightyear action figure. Buzz does not seem to be aware that he is a toy, which becomes apparent after he sees the package he came in (a space ship shaped box) to be his damaged ship. He believes himself to be a space ranger on a mission to save the universe from ""the evil Emperor Zurg."" The other toys take to him immediately, being impressed by his many features. Only Woody is unconvinced, showing jealousy towards Buzz. As time moves on, Andy clearly shows to have high regard of Buzz, seemingly forgetting about Woody, as with the other toys who Buzz spends a lot of time with. By the end of the day, Andy sleeps with Buzz in his arms and confirms he has a new favorite toy. Eventually, Woody confronts Buzz while he is repairing his ""ship"" where he finally realizes that Buzz actually believe himself to be the real space ranger, and not toy model of the character.Andy is given a surprise trip to his favorite restaurant: Pizza Planet. However, he can take only one toy with him. Knowing this, Woody assumes he'll take Buzz so he tries to shove him behind Andy's dresser, but instead inadvertently knocks him out the window. When the other toys learn of Woody's actions, they think he has turned into a killer. They try to attack him without even giving him a chance to explain, but he is saved when Andy come into the room to look for Buzz. Unable to find Buzz, Andy takes Woody on the trip instead. At a gas stop, Woody finds that Buzz grabbed a hold of the family's minivan and is with them. Woody tries to apologize but Buzz won't listen, and starts a fight which knocks both out of the minivan that causes them to be left behind. I remember watching this film when i was about four years old and having Woody and Buss figures and waiting for them to come to life when they thought i wasn't looking. That's the impact a film and interesting Toy characters could do to a little kid. This film remains my favorite animated movie ever and one of my favorite movies ever. Talking Toys, a mean bully who hates toys, a thrilling adventure with spectacular animation and some of the best characters ever. There is not much to go into about the plot or anything, it is simply put a perfect film for all ages it even has some small adult humor and that you don't get anymore. 10/10"

","Tom Hanks and Tim Allen put their talents at voice acting to work and they do it with thorough and complete perfection in ""Toy Story"" a Pixar animated classic film that even now, over ten years since its theatrical debut, continues to be loved by audiences of all ages. It retells the child's dream of their inanimate toys suddenly coming to life whenever a human is not around. All of the toys have personalities and they are even organized as their own society.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays the voice of Woody, a cowboy doll with a pull string and Tim Allen provides the voice of Buzz Lightyear, a new action figure toy that has crushed all other toys at the market--but the thing is, Buzz believes he is really THE character he represents and not an Asian-made product. Among them there are other toys such as Slinky Dog, voiced by Jim Varney, Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn) and Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles). All of the voices are done well and creates the illusion of real talking characters instead of actors providing voices and then having animators synchronize their 3D models with the prerecorded sounds.<br/><br/>Now that I am older, I appreciate and cherish ""Toy Story"" and its successful sequel ""Toy Story 2"" (1999) even more than I did when I first saw them as a kid. I now appreciate the character elements, can understand the point of the jokes better, and respect the talents and efforts of the filmmakers who made this movie possible. I recommend both ""Toy Story"" and its sequel as two of Pixar's best films and some of the best family movies of all time. Children will adore and love it, adults will laugh. Bottom line, it's a great movie."

","Disney used to be good, wholesome family entertainment that was not only clean but fun. Now, most everything they put out is outdated postmodern trash that portrays all children as geniuses able to rule the world and all parents as evil minions trying to keep their children from having fun. Thank God for Pixar coming to existence. Starting with Toy Story in 1995, they made a great family film that appeals to adult humor as well as children. They haven't failed since. They can do no wrong it seems, and I pray it continues that way. Of all their great films, this is undoubtedly in my mind the best of them all. It is also arguably better than any animated film Disney ever did, including the classics of the 1940s and 50s. The premise is so clever and daring in that it could go wrong in so many ways. It never does, though, and in a mere 82 minutes, it covers more information than many other 2 hour films. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen have become iconic in their roles as Woody and Buzz. The animation and dialogue is so good it is as if they are really on screen arguing with one another. The supporting characters are also very good and funny. With animation, perhaps the most important aspect is the voice characters. Pixar has done a great job of not always going with a star to do the voices, but rather simply going with the one that fits the character best. Overall, Toy Story is superb film-making with a great script, wonderful voices and animation that still impresses despite all the technological improvements. Thank you, Pixar. I am truly grateful to you for saving animated films."

","""Toy Story"" was, as known, the first movie of Pixar that should ""conquest"" the world after Disney's hand-drawn films were consider as mediocre. Except ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Cars"", ""Toy Story"" is the best of all the Pixar films (here comes a little SPOILER; this movie is not presented with the Pixar logo at the beginning of the film, before the title credits. SPOILERS OVER). It's like some TV-series; the first seasons are sometimes the best, right?<br/><br/>Anyway, I watch ""Toy Story"" for the first time when I was 11 and I enjoyed it. It's never been my favorite movie of all times, but it's a enjoyable and watchable movie. The animation is gorgeous, the story is simple, but well-defined and the script is good. It's a good idea to make a CGI computer animated movie about toys that comes alive (SPOILERS; when the humans aren't watching. SPOILERS OVER).<br/><br/>This film has some more adult humor comparing to the Disney hand-drawn films before 1995, which is quite good. (SPOILER) Most of the characters are simple and well-defined, except the sarcastic Hamm and Mr. Potato Head (not that I dislike them, but they deliver a more sophisticated humor than the rest of the characters). Woody is a more human main character, who makes really big mistakes in the movie, but learn what's wrong and what's right. <br/><br/>My favorite characters were Buzz (I absolutely love his lines), Slinky (who stand up for Woody more than he deserves) and Scud, Sid's dog, who definitely should be in the sequel. (SPOILERS OVER).<br/><br/>This movie has some scenes that could may be considered a little spooky for the youngest children, but for those who are 8 years old and upward, it's a suitable movie <br/><br/>What I didn't like in this film is the score of Randy Newman, who is actually very annoying and too sugary for me. Unfortenaly he became the composer of most of the Pixar's film. But the songs in ""Toy Story"" are working quite all right. Not that they are so memorable, but they don't destroy the movie.<br/><br/>So ""Toy Story"" it's a funny and enjoyable movie worth watching."

","I don't necessarily like G-rated movies, but I make this one an exception. This movie is just great (it was the biggest moneymaker of 1995, and rightly so). I think that ""Toy Story"" appeals to kids and adults alike 'cause it's so funny, fast, and exhilarating. No one had done anything like this before; it was such a huge earthquake in the movie industry. It was also the world's first completely CG-animated movie. I can especially identify with Rex 'cause we're both nervous at times (except it's not from an inferiority complex), and we both like video games. This is easily one of my most favorite movies. ""An instant classic for all ages""."

I like the second one better but this one is still pretty good. I don't like very many animated things, but this is definitely a great exception. All of the actors and actresses that did the voices were really good, and I definitely give them much credit, especially since it was made in 1995.

","The first movie made entirely from computer animation. I watched this when I was 6 and I couldn't believe how lifelike it was, well probably from todays standards its pretty basic computer animation but what the hell.<br/><br/>The movie is about a boy called Andy, and his room of toys, that can talk and are lifelike but Andy doesn't know that. Woody, a cowboy doll, is Andy's favorite toy until Andy's birthday where he gets the new Buzz Light year. So Woody is angry, this is as far as I am going into the plot. The voices are awesome and Tom Hanks does a great job. I watched this movie again when I turned 12 to see if it was just me as a 6 year old that liked it but no it wasn't this movie is great for everyone. Your kids will be trying to fly like Buzz and going in and out of their rooms to see if they can catch their toys talking. A DEFINITE MUST!"

The film creates an entire new perspective to reality, but does it quickly and effective, and you don't even notice that Toy Story ""is just a film"". You join in and easily recognise yourself in so many behaviours, attitude and thoughts, which is exactly why it is such a successful ""piece-of-art""! My son and daughter have asked to watch it so many times, and it is so full of details, that even after the 10th (or 20th?) time, you can still find a little tweak that you hadn't noticed before (e.g. can you find the ""kiss my arse"" expression, which is so hidden from children, and still so clear for all us grown-ups?). I really loved it, family love it, my son has grown with it as part of his great favourite films, and now my daughter, 11 years younger, has also become a big fan, so you can imagine how many times my hubby and I watched this.

In the end, both toys unite to get back to Andy when they get lost in the city and then get kidnapped, or should I say toy-napped, by the evil Psycho Sid, who lives next door. They escape the death sentence by uniting with the toys that Sid destroyed and then put back together. It is a fantastic movie, and the animation is amazing. The voice talents for this movie was phenomenal, with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen leading the way of a all-star team of talent. It was one exceptional movie, and it is perfect for all viewers of any age.

I usually don't like films like this, I'm more of a mature film type person, however it is impossible not to be entertained while watching this. I liked Tim Allen a lot, he stole the show, though hanks did a good job with his character too.

","Remember the original Pixar movies? Remember when Pixar didn't have stereotypical surfers and rappers? It was when the characters were fun and familiar. They didn't waste out time with farting jokes, but instead had smart jokes that weren't overdone. (even if they were more geared towards adults.) Luckily, we still have one good, classic Pixar movie; Toy Story. Peter Doctor knows how to make a fun and enjoyable family movie.<br/><br/>Woody, is the ""top toy"" of Andy's bedroom. He leads meeting and events, and is one of the most popular toys there. But, then, Andy has a birthday party. Everybody is worried about getting replaced by a toy, but Woody assures them that there is nothing to be worried about. Funny, how he ends up getting replaced by Buzz Lightyear-the new popular toy. Ironic, huh? So, he gets jealous and tries to kill Buzz, by setting up a trap and pushing him out the window. Then, the other toys find out, and think ""Let's kill Woody!"" Wow, the irony in it all! The only way the toys will forgive him, is if he brings Buzz back. So, Woody and Buzz meet up at ""Pizza Palace."" After exploring a bit, they get caught by Sid-the sick and twisted kid next door.<br/><br/>But, what makes this movie so good? Toy Story isn't your average kids' film. It seems to have a message in it all. Two unlikely friends, Buzz and Woody hate each other at first. Then, they slowly learn trust each other, and stick together through thick and thin.<br/><br/>Toy Story is perhaps one of those ""feel good"" movies. It's fun, and doesn't try to be anything it's not. Toy Story is an enjoyable, fun, and all-around excellent film. Be sure to put it on your ""To Watch"" list.<br/><br/>10/10"

That's why girls talk to Barbie or have tea parties with all the toys, and guys chat with GI Joe and make believe the hot wheels can talk! Let's not even bring up our puppets! Pixar and Disney not only knock our socks off with the most amazing computer generated animation, but the writers of this story hit a home-run and totally captured the whimsical innocence of what we all knew was going on when we were kids; that our toys are alive and only want to be played with and cherished. In addition, the superb voice acting by a cast of actors that obviously still remember being a kid, only gives this instant classic the status of being the ""Gold Standard"" to which all others in this category will have to be judged. My only complaint and why I only give 9 out of 10, is that it is far, far too short, running 1 hour and 20 minutes! I know I'm selfish, but I want MORE!!

","This was the first Pixar movie I've seen. I remember seeing it back 10 years ago, back when it was new. Back then Pixar wasn't too well known in the world. This movie made their intro and beginning of their long line of great movies.<br/><br/>Not only was it Pixar's first movie, but it was also the first ever CGI Movie ever made. Back then I didn't know what CGI was so I didn't had a clue how they even made the movie itself(I was only 7 when I first watched it in theaters).<br/><br/>The story to this movie is unlike anything you've seen before. It all has to do with what do Toys do when no one is around to play with them. It features memorable characters and some existing toys like ""Little Tykes, Mr. Potatoe Head, Slinky, Barrel of monkeys, etc."" The main character is Woody a classic Cowboy doll who is the favorite toy of Andy, a kind and good boy. He gets respect and pride from the other toys. Life seems good for him.<br/><br/>Till one day on Andy's Birthday, he receives a special toy that any boy would want a ""Buzz Lightyear"" action figure. Who has cool features that not even Woody has. And Woody fears Buzz will be Andy's new favorite toy and lose his respect and pride with the other toys.<br/><br/>Toy story has some laughs, excitement, and great visuals for a Well done CGI movie.

","Toy Story is definitely a film that a kid should watch before they are a teen. Its adventure and great sense of humour is appealing to adult audiences as well, and the atmosphere is brilliant. This really is a Toy Story. The plot is indeed quite simple, and it would have to be for a classic family. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks)is a toy 'sheriff' doll, owned by a young boy called Andy. Woodys Toy life couldn't as Andy loves him a lot, but as Andy's birthday party arises tension fills the bedroom with each toy living in fear of being replaced. Everything goes well till the last birthday present is opened.. enter Buzz Lightyear!<br/><br/>I would be criminal to tell you the rest of the story, but as far as humour and adventure are concerned, this film impresses in both categories. The toys different personalities really contrast and make you laugh, from the smart-chat of Mr. Potatoe head, to Slinky who is Woodys best toy friend. Its so easy to follow this film - the plot and characters are easy to watch the computer graphics are top notch. Compared to modern day CGI kids films, this stands out purely because of its innocence - a simple story, theirs no techno-babble, and its really fun. This truly is the film of the Nineties!"

","Kids have always wondered if their toys ever came to life when they were asleep and if the toys themselves had lives of their own by doing the same things that humans do.<br/><br/>Toy Story is the first film from Pixar Studios to make cartoons more humanistic with CGI than by drawing them out. Tom Hanks provides the voice of Woody the Cowboy, who is the ringleader of the toys around Andy's room. He overhears the important events around Andy's life and one of the things shocking is that they are moving to another home.<br/><br/>Most of Andy's toys are compiled of average boy toys: from a nervous dinosaur name Rex (Wallace Shawn) to a grumpy Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickels), a smart Aleck piggy bank called Hamm (John Ratzenburg); even Andy's little sister has toys that join with the gang, Bo Peep (Annie Potts of ""Ghostbusters"" fame) has a crush on the cowboy. There are other characters in the story; a dog on a string name Slinky Dog (Jim Varney of ""Ernest"" fame) and a plastic army doll name Sarge (R. Lee Ermey of Full Metal Jacket).<br/><br/>One of the elements of ""Toy Story"" is very psychological, and that is the fear of a new toy. Sure everybody likes to get a new toy, but the problem is that when people buy new toys, they automatically forget that their old toys exist and lose excitement within them. When Andy's birthday party comes a week before the leave, Woody sends Sarge and the plastic army men with the baby talkers to hear what kind of presents Andy has gotten this year. As Mr. Potato jokes that he wants a wife, the gang gets cut off by a nervous Rex and realize that the toys have to stay still.<br/><br/>The new toy in Andy's life is the popular and all out, Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) in which he pushes Woody to the side leaving the new toy on the bed. Everybody clamors over Woody being pushed off the bed as every other toy in the room tries to figure out what's up there.<br/><br/>Woody is introduced to the new character as he tells everyone he can fly and fire a high laser. A smart-ass Potato Head makes a statement about Woody's voice box that it sounds a car ran over it. Days before the move, Woody is left out of the group as everybody including Bo Peep are all with Buzz Lightyear.<br/><br/>Woody has a plan of getting rid of Buzz and he uses an electric race-car to push him out the window. Now every toy is against Woody and want to beat him up; but Andy saves Woody when him and the rest of his family are going out for pizza and can't find Buzz, so Andy takes the cowboy instead. With little relief, when the car stops at a gas station, Buzz has been hiding under the car and fights with Woody outside; suddenly the car leaves with both toys stranded.<br/><br/>Buzz has a plan for both him and Woody to get back with Andy; they get into a pizza truck and try to find Andy and his family and notices that the neighborhood bully Sid is there so the toys hide in a toy machine where they are taken with another toy back to Sid's house where one toy is torture to death (relax, its not the main toys). So now they have to work together in order to be with Andy and tell the other toys that everything is all right.<br/><br/>""Toy Story"" is a blessing with delight and wonder and just like my review of ""Monsters, Inc."" it's a movie of curiosity and a joy to behold."

It was well worth the wait, even as a six year old I could realize that. Toy Story was the first fully computer animated movie ever to be made. This was a huge impact in the world of special effects and art. That was part of the reason why this movie was such a huge success. The other reason for the huge success is because of the concept of the movie. Where else can you find a movie where toys come to life and have their own world inside of a little boy's room. This is one of the first movies to have that type of story.<br/><br/>The other computer animated movies to follow Toy Story are A Bug's Life, Antz, Toy Story 2, Shrek, Monster's Inc., Ice Age, Shrek 2, The Incredibles, The Polar Express, and Shark Tale. After seeing Shark Tale, I figured out that computer animated films are starting to become a cliché. However, the Pixar movies are really good. <br/><br/>The voice work in Toy Story is also really good. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are the perfect voices to fit the characters of this movie. This was also a part of Tim Allen's big uprising in the '90's. <br/><br/>Every kid should see this, most kids that I know like this movie.

","Growing up isn't easy, but if you can laugh at yourself and what you're going through, the journey may be made a bit more bearable and enjoyable. Toy Story does this for kids and adults by reminding us that life is a journey of experiences, reflection, and growth. Many of the social issues that plague children and adolescents are addressed within this film. Peer pressure, stealing to get what you want, confronting violence, insecurity, jealously, competition, first-love, friendship, and revenge are all parts of the magic of Toy Story. Humor is employed to skillfully and thoughtfully weave these trying issues throughout the script. Most importantly, the characters demonstrate that we must learn to think about what we are doing and how our actions affect our own life and the lives around us."

Tom Hanks and Tim Allen do great voice work as the lead toys, with Cowboy Bob's jealousy of new toy Buzz Lightyear providing the fuel for most of the story. They're both hilarious as Bob plays the brains, and hatches schemes for this and that, including spooking the evil kid next door who tortures and blows up toys for fun. Buzz is mostly on the job thinking he really is a Space Ranger, loses his self identity when he finds out he is just a toy, winding up as a tea time doll for a little girl. In the end, though, they come together and save the day and themselves just in time...8.7/10 This DVD is part of the Toy Story 2 Pack, but I believe the actual movie transfers are the same in all the retail packages.

To make matters worse Buzz doesn't think he is a toy and believes he is on a mission. The story really gets going when woody inadvertantly knocks buzz out of the house and the two of them end up with evil Syd who tortures toys.<br/><br/>There's lots of adult humour meaning that the parents will find this as funny as the kids.

The characters are rich, three dimensional(Most are - except for most humans which is quite ironic and charming) Future generations will love these characters and they will endure forever.

","Okay, about this movie. It was fantastic, as a lot of people would agree. Too bad there isn't an 8.5.(I gave it an 8) This is what the movie really deserved. The animation was good for that day and age, and I must say that this movie marked the beginning of the age of 3d movies and television shows. The story was good, for a lot of us are fascinated by talking toys and what it might be like if they really existed. Anyway, this movie is spelled G-O-O-D!If you haven't watched it, you need to. I must say that its not a ""family"" movie. Not everyone will be thrilled about it. I've watched it repeatly (I was older each time), and it hasn't gotten old yet.

The computer graphics were great, and the toys in the film were very well made to look real. (I wish I had a Rex)  The ending was perfect because I had hoped for a sequel. I give it 10 out of 10."
"Silverzero","10","0","0","18 April 2003"," Superbly animated, brilliantly witty, instantly likeable and endlessly entertaining.
","The first ever fully computer generated movie, `Toy Story' really is a milestone in cinematic history. Enjoyed by young and old alike, this is funny even for the most bitter minded. After all, what's not to like? It isn't a three hour epic like `Gone With The Wind' but it is thoroughly entertaining for its eighty minute running time and hastily avoids wearing out its welcome. <br/><br/>Not only is the animation brilliant but the characters are even better. Tom Hanks was perfectly chosen as the neurotic, jealous but easily likeable Woody. He proves that he can do comedy, even if he doesn't physically appear in the movie. Always reliable for his comedy, Tim Allen certainly delivers jokes at a rapid rate. And he perfectly fits into the role as Buzz Lightyear. The chemistry between the two main characters is priceless. Sure, they aren't `Bogart and Bacall' but they make a great duo. The supporting cast of characters include Rex, Slinky, Mr. Potato Head and Little Bo Peep. They are brilliantly animated and while most of the limelight goes to Woody and Buzz, they still make good use of the scenes they're in.<br/><br/>
The film was soon followed by a sequel `Toy Story 2' in '99. While the animation was more impressive and it was a bigger film, I still preferred the first one. Mainly because `Toy Story' had more chemistry between Woody and Buzz. But also because the sequel didn't have as many good laughs and aimed for boring sentimentality a bit too often. <br/><br/>So overall, `Toy Story' is an outstanding breakthrough in the world of animation.  The comedy, visuals and level of enjoyment are all picture perfect. There are no flaws and the film barely ever makes a wrong move. 8.5/10."

","Wow, I remember back in 1995 when I first saw this movie back in 1995. I think it was the movie being the farthest away that I could remember in theaters, and I saw it like two or three times. At first, I thought it was something about these toys trying to get to another group of toys, and they were a big group themselves. I couldn't believe how amazing the plot was.<br/><br/>After I saw that movie it was like I couldn't get enough of Toy Story stuff. The characters were cool as well, and they just all seemed to be in the right places at the right time, like Mr. Potato Head, especially. And I had waited for years for a Toy Story 2 to come out, and after four years of waiting, it finally happened! And it was an excellent sequel! The extra fun in this movie, spotting the other toys that make cameos. It was kind of a simple plot that just worked, what with the rivalry between Woody and Buzz competing for Andy's favorite toy and the wisecracks of that pig, and Rex. I even got my own TS toys and such. It was truly a memorable movie. 10/10. Nice work, Disney and Pixar!"
"Jayson Firestorm","9","0","0","2 March 2002"," Great fun, a film that's not just for kids
","I wasn't too sure about this film before I watched it. The premise (basically of showing the secret lives of toys) sounded great, but I'm not a particular fan of the often sickly-sweet Disney, not to mention that I've seen several other computer animated films that were so-so, but didn't really live up to their hype. So it was with pleasant surprise that I found myself enjoying every minute of Toy Story.<br/><br/>The plot is straight forward; a bunch of toys, who live in a young boy called Andy's bedroom, come to life, walk, talk, and generally get up to mischief when no-one's around. They're lead by Wild West Sheriff doll Woody (superbly voiced by Tom Hanks), who, being Andy's favourite toy, takes it upon himself to organise all the toy's activities and make sure that they return to their proper place when anyone comes near. But Andy's birthday is coming up  something which the toy's are fearing, because that means one thing: presents; new toys, which if they're unlucky, could result in some of them being turned out for the next yard sale to make space!<br/><br/>Woody's life as the much-respected `leader' of the toys is bliss, until the fatal day of Andy's birthday, when the boy's last, biggest present turns out to be a galactic crusader Buzz Lightyear figure (voiced by Tim Allen), a shiny new toy with a lot of fancy features. Woody soon finds himself knocked off his place as most popular toy, and before long, he's planning to get rid of Buzz, which not only results in him loosing his respect from the other toys, but ultimately winds up with himself and Buzz being lost away from home.<br/><br/>Despite my initial worries about this film just being another over-hyped sickly Disney picture, I was not only pleasantly proven wrong, but would go as far as to say it's one of the most enjoyable, memorable films I've seen for several years (okay, well the film is 6 years old, but I've only just seen it!).<br/><br/>The voice actors are great and do the animated creations justice, and it's wonderful to see so many great toy characters brought to life. Some of the toys are created based on classic toy designs, while others  such as Mr. Potato Head  are based on real existing ones. The other toys who inhabit the bedroom include Slinky' Dog (complete with springy middle), Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Bo Peep  who has a soft spot for Woody. My personal favourites are the classic green toy soldiers (who are dispatched on a covert mission to report back to the other toys on what Andy's birthday presents are), and Rex, the plastic dinosaur who can't be just scary no matter how much he tries!<br/><br/>The story is nice and straight-forward, and as with all great simple stories, that works in it's favour and is what makes the film so enjoyable. It doesn't get bogged down in too many whats, hows and whys too much, it just delivers a wonderful world where toys come to life behind their owners back.<br/><br/>Despite all the flashy computer generated graphics and animation, beyond that the story has a wonderfully classical' feel, being sure to deliver some good old morals with it's tale. There's no violence (well, unless you consider a plastic toy falling out of a window violent!), no bad language, and you just know that things are going to wind up alright by the end of the story. There are no real bad guys; the main conflict is based around Woody's jealously and dislike for Buzz. The film's only real villain is Sid, a cruel neighbouring kid who enjoys destroying toys in as messy and as extreme ways possible.<br/><br/>The film is one that will appeal to all ages. As I said, initially I was rather put off by the Disney' label, fearing it would be the typically childish, by-the-numbers, squeaky-clean American tale as seen in so many other Disney films  particularly the animated ones in recent years. But there really is universal appeal in this film, with its wonderful mix of slick graphics, good voice acting, and sheer fun of bringing toys to life on screen. It's generally suitable for and will appeal to all, from very young to very old. The only bit that very young might not like so much is the scenes where Woody and Buzz are trapped at Sid's house, and they meet a horde of nightmarishly tortured' toys, that have been broken and re-assembled by Sid into creepy new creations.<br/><br/>All in all, a great film, and one that stands the key test of being enjoyable enough to watch over and over again.<br/><br/>And you know how all those times when you were a kid, much to the annoyance of your parents, your toys always seemed to end up in a mess and not where you left them? Well, now we know why!"

You feel as if you know them thoroughly by the conclusion and are moved by the life lessons they've learned, lessons you would want any child to learn.

Anyway, we can't avoid the ""Disney touch"" and all those awful songs...<br/><br/>So, after ""Toy story"" came other movies that were much better, but this was the first one and it has a relevant position in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>*My rate: 6/10"

","Let me explain. I love films. Toy Story is beyond excellent. Toy Story 3-D is perhaps the biggest con since Keyser Soze convinced the world he didn't exist. There is ONE SCENE in the whole film where you actually get the sense of 3-D and that is right at the end during a snow scene. If you have Toy Story on DVD or have seen it before, stay at home because you are seeing nothing new here. The thing that annoys me is that in addition to paying to see the same film that I own on DVD, I paid extra for 3-D glasses!! unbelievable!! it should've been a highway mans mask and a club. I implore you to stay away from this and Toy Story 2 3-D when it is out as I am sure they will just do the same again."
"HonestReviews","1","10","51","25 March 2015"," Rubbish movie, so many plot holes...
","I don't understand why this film is so highly rated. The film has so many plot holes in it I actually lost count. Now before I start this review, I'm not going to say toys talking is a plot hole, the idea of them talking is interesting but it opens up so many other questions that the movie never really explains. Also, don't argue, ""it's a kids movie"", films need to make sense in order to work whether they're for kids or not. This film is so bad and here is why. Even if you like this film, you have to agree with some of the points I'm making here:<br/><br/>Buzz thinks he's a space ranger. If that is the case then why does he allow Andy to play with him? Does he not think why is this giant kid picking me up and throwing me around? Buzz however makes no attempt to communicate with Andy. Surely Buzz would try and talk to him? This doesn't make sense given that Buzz doesn't believe he's a toy. Also when Woody hits a button that release Buzz's helmet and he gasps for air, you're telling me Andy never pushed that button? He's owned the toy for weeks yet hadn't pressed all the buttons? Rubbish.<br/><br/>The end scene is one of the worst scenes for me. It's broad daylight and two toys are running down a street. Where are all the pedestrians on the street? How are they able to open the back of the moving van truck? Surely the driver would notice doesn't he check his rear view mirrors, or surely a button or signal would come up revealing that a door was open at the back of his truck? Wow any thief could steal from this useless driver. Also when Woody and Buzz fly down from the sky and land in Andy's car. Andy's car is directly in front of the truck driver, how could he possibly not see this???<br/><br/>The most hilarious scene though is when Woody is moving around in the middle of the road and a person in a car honks at him. Woody then ducks in front of the car as it drives over him. 1) Why would you sound your car horn if there was a toy in the road? 2) The driver therefore saw Woody as he sounded his horn. 3) He must have seen Woody moving about and be thrown from the moving van. Does this driver know toys are alive or something? Is it only kids who are unaware? I just don't understand. It's never fully explained. Continuing this point: when the toys all surround Woody and prepare to attack him after he knocks Buzz out the window, we hear Andy from outside shouting. This allows them to return into position. What if he hadn't have shouted though? He would have walked in and seen them. This is why this idea of toys coming to life could never work! No kid would always shout when they enter their room and most kids leave their doors open yet Andy never does - allowing the toys to move around and communicate.<br/><br/>Once you take these plot holes into account, the conclusion is that the film sucks and is a really poor movie. Honestly how could anyone like it? An interesting idea that just falls flat. And also the final question that is never addressed is: Why can't toys reveal they're alive to humans??? It's never explained and I don't get why. Poor film 1 star. Awful."

The Christmas Toy by Jim Henson is much warmer. On the good side I enjoyed the minor characters, especially the snake. I also liked the end title duet. The score was good too. I wasn't over impressed by the animation since I consider story & characters to be more important. Since I didn't like those I can't recommend this. But if you do want to see great animation Ice Age & Anastasia are two of the best. Disney are not as cute as they used to be and that is not a good thing. 3/10"
"saraarts","1","14","88","9 July 1999"," Horrible message
","I was well prepared to like this movie on the basis of the art alone, and the art did not disappoint.  However, I found much of the humor to be based on cruelty, and I was truly horrified by the overall message of the film: ""Lower your expectations for yourself and everything will work out fine."" It reminded me of The Breakfast Club, whose main theme seemed to be ""Conform to the style of the popular kids, and all your problems will dissipate."" This is just so wrong.  If you want to see really good computer animation that will amuse you, inspire your children to be good and strong and true, and which predates this  shallow and uninspiring vehicle, check out the television series Reboot, now being re-run on Cartoon Network.  This movie is only good for refreshing your mental catalog of toys you may have once owned."
"Skeletors_Hood","Null","2","6","23 January 2003"," Overhyped, over praised, and just plain dull....
","Yes people, I will dare to come out as the perhaps only person to truly hate this film.  While the animation is groundbreaking to say the least, it doesn't mean that it has a story to back it up.  I for one love cartoon movies, but this left a sour taste in  my mouth.  Maybe it's because in what is supposed to be a kids' movie, we see one character trying to ""off"" another character, out of pure jealousy.  The other toys were just annoying as the chorus, as they, like the leads, had a total lack of any real character.  There were some bad attempts at humor that didn't even win a giggle out of me or my family.<br/><br/>Skip it and see Shrek or Ice Age.  Better stories to balance the animation."

"zkonedog","9","1","2","11 March 2017"," Everyone Loves Toys
","Until the Disney-Pixar collaboration that produced this wonderful film, movies were pretty much lopped into two basic categories: child & adult. Children would be lost, bored, terrified, or scarred by the adult fare, while adults would be lost, bored, and uncomfortable at the kiddie flicks. Fortunately, ""Toy Story"" changed everything.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this all-CGI film focuses on the childhood toys of young Andy. At first, Andy is in his ""cowboy stage"", and so western doll Woody (Tom Hanks) is his prized possession. However, once Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) arrives via an extra-special birthday present, things begin to change inside the toybox, as the two begin a battle for supremacy over young Andy.<br/><br/>There are two main areas in which this movie succeeds so brilliantly: First, it is incredible eye- candy for children. Running the gamut from every type of toy and crazy situation imaginable, this film enraptures the kiddies and will have them watching over and over.<br/><br/>Second, it works because you will be watching it over and over with them! As you marvel at the CGI effects, you will also be laughing at the hilarious jokes that, while going right over your kid's head, will make you burst into laughter. This is mainly accomplished by the cast of ""supporting"" characters such as the wise-cracking Hamm (John Ratzenberger), the cowardly dinosaur Rex (Wallace Shawn), the loyal dog Slink (Jim Varney), and the ever-sardonic Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles). Their jokes and humorous situations will make it feel as if you aren't watching a kids movie at all.<br/><br/>Also, though the technology has come a long way even since this film's 1995 release date, it is still no less of a filmmaking marvel. For perhaps the first time in cinema history, computer- animation actually made you feel as if you were watching a ""real"" film, not just a cheap special- effects bonanza.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Toy Story"" is one of the most influential films ever produced for its ability to blur the lines between children and adult cinema. For the first time, parents were truly able to enjoy a movie with their children."

","This movie will go down as one of the greatest animated movies of all time. When I was younger I used to watch this movie all the time. When you are that age you really don't notice any of the great animations of the movie. The Movie came out in the 90s ,and still have better animations then some movies today. The shots are great to. For example, the shot of woody hanging off the moving truck is one of the best ever. The aerial view of Woody hanging off the truck makes him really tiny and worthless. However the shot goes to a close up of Woody ,and makes him feel like a hero in some type of way. This movie changed the way we feel about toys as a whole too. This movie helped children have a more of an imagination with their toys. This movie saved my childhood ,and still will be my all time favorite animated movie. I hope people feel the same way about the movie."
"talkertwix","Null","1","2","23 February 2016"," You've Got a Friend In Me
","Toy Story Review: You've Got a Friend in Me<br/><br/>Toy Story was released in 1995 with help from production companies Pixar and Walt Disney Pictures. The box office collected nearly $364,402,211 worldwide off of this movie alone. While Toy Story was released over ten years ago, Americans of all ages today are still viewing the movie for leisure entertainment. Aspects such as plot development, thematic lessons, cinematography and animation, and originality are all qualities that make the movie stand above its counterparts. The plot development and basis of the movie are relatable to multiple audiences. The film takes place in a suburban, upscale neighborhood in which Andy Davis and his family live in a colonial, two story, stereotypical, 1990's home. While the family goes about living normal day- to day life, behind the scenes is where the action intensifies and this is where the story inevitably begins. What appeals to most children while watching the movie, are the ""talking toys"" that create their own story midst the chaotic Davis household. As the toys come to life, there are several characters that prominently take the spotlight. Beginning with Sheriff Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks. This is Andy's favorite toy, and inevitably takes on an established leadership role throughout the movie. Continuing on, the audience is introduced to heroic Buzz Lightyear voiced by Tim Allen. Buzz creates much skepticism amongst the other toys and consequently creates the first sub climax of the movie, as a struggle for power emerges between Buzz and Woody. As the movie progresses, there are many thematic lessons to be taken by audience members, regardless of age. Of course Disney never fails to incorporate enlightening take home messages into the production. This is the benefit to this movie in comparison to other animated films. Positivity in realm of life's negative events that are often out of our control is one way in which Disney and Pixar films continue to boast their movie popularity. Director John Lasseter thoroughly thought through every detail in the making of the movie, and this was never so apparent than in the close attention to detail portrayed in animation and cinematography. The colors used were bright and cheerful, as well as the authenticity of the costuming of the character's clothes were accurate in terms of realistic concepts. Furthermore, the voice lines conveyed by Allen and Hanks were portrayed with great enthusiasm to fit the characters' bubbly personalities. Lasseter also nailed this aspect in that the dialogue was simplistic enough to be understood by younger audiences, however witty, personal, and quirky enough to enthuse more mature audiences as well. Originality is a quality that every movie must have, but only the best of movies convey properly. The fact that this movie was released in 1995, and is still viewed today by many different generations is a quality that in itself deserves to be recognized. Looking back at the simplicity of talking toys, it is monumental and worth noting that many details to enhance viewer attraction were presented to perfection to thoroughly create a movie that satisfies a wide variety of audiences. The production was backed by such popular demand in fact, that producing companies and director Lasseter released a sequel four years later. Taking over the charts, both movies scored over an 8.42 on the IMDb rating survey collection, and deservingly so."

"wolverinesforever","10","1","2","22 December 2015"," 20 years later, it still rocks!
","What more can be said? 20 years ago, Pixar released ""Toy Story,"" and the rest is animation history. Computer animation has since become the dominant form of animation. Dreamworks, Warner Brothers, and Universal (and maybe some other companies I have forgotten) have created their own computer animation studios to rival Pixar. Pixar themselves would continue to push just how far animation could go, both in animation quality and in storytelling ambition. <br/><br/>So one may wonder, 20 years after this all got started, is the one that started it all still excellent by today's standards? The answer is an emphatic YES.<br/><br/>The story is fairly well known by now, but I'll repeat it anyway for those who are unfamiliar. This ""Toy Story"" centers around the toy cowboy Woody (wonderfully voiced by Tom Hanks). Woody is the favorite toy of the young boy Andy (John Morris), who has several other toys, including Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky Dog (the late Jim Varney), and Hamm the Piggy Bank (John Ratzenberg, whose consistent appearances in Pixar films has become a running gag of sorts - and was acknowledged as such in ""Cars""). The film starts on Andy's birthday party, a time when all of his toys get nervous, because Andy might get a toy that he likes more than the others. Sure enough, he's received the latest ""cool"" toy, spaceman Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen, an inspired choice). This results in Woody being demoted to ""second best,"" something he doesn't take well at all. Woody attempts to push Buzz out of the way so he can get back to being Andy's favorite toy, but through a series of mistakes (and misadventures), he winds up making both he and Buzz separated from their owner Andy. Worse, they end up in the possession of their neighbor, Sid (Erik von Detten), who prefers to blow up his toys instead of play with them. Now Woody and Buzz have to make peace and work together if they are to return to Andy (oh, and did I mention that Andy is moving away soon?).<br/><br/>The premise is simple enough, but it's in the execution where things get very inspired. Take, for example, how the toys attempt to learn what presents Andy is receiving. They send several Army Men Toy Soldiers down for a ""Code Red"" mission, and how these soldiers pull this off always puts a smile on my face. I still remember being inspired by watching the soldiers move that radio into that small leafy plant on the bottom floor (I was seven when I first saw this). I was so inspired, in fact, that a year later, I was ""teaching"" my toys how to hide in the Christmas tree during Christmas. Director John Lasseter and the Pixar team have deeply considered how a world of toys would work. How would a toy feel about getting relegated to ""second best"" when a new toy comes around? And it's pretty fun to see how the toys have to consistently make sure the ""human world"" never knows about their awareness.<br/><br/>And the strength of this script goes beyond its consideration of a world of toys. Its tight and to the point. There are no wasted moments in the film's (short) 81-minute runtime. Pixar is not satisfied with simply showing what computer animation can do. They are interested in guiding along through a story that provides laughs, thrills, an occasional scare, and something valuable to learn at the end.<br/><br/>Obviously, the quality of computer animation has improved greatly since this film first came out (watch how they animate a dog here, and compare it to how Pixar would animate Sullivan's fur in ""Monster's Inc."", for example). But let's remember, at the time, this was considered to be massively advanced animation. Many adult critics wondered if kids would realize just how big of a breakthrough this was in the history of animation, but I can reassure them, I may have been only 7 years old, but even I realized an entirely computer animated film was a very big deal indeed! Looking back now, I do think we should consider some of the things the animators did in this film that further emphasized what computer animation should be going for. Gene Siskel pointed out that you could see a reflection off of Buzz's helmet (and even stated, as a compliment, ""They didn't have to do that!""). The toys, the settings, everything was beautifully rendered and still looks good today. Even if one just reduced this picture to its visual qualities (inadvisable), they would still come out quite satisfied.<br/><br/>Today officially marks the 20 year anniversary of when I saw this film (December 22nd, 1995), and it's high time I got to writing a review of it. ""Toy Story"" absolutely changed movies, and that is not a hyperbole. It's popularity made others realize the financial potential in computer animation. It's quality made everyone realize just what computer animation could (and should) pull off, both in visuals and storytelling. Pixar themselves would start a very long winning streak of highly acclaimed pictures, with many seemingly getting even more glowing reviews then the picture before it (heck we've gotten two great ""Toy Story"" sequels to boot). That this film still holds up even though many envelope pushing animated pictures have been released since is impressive indeed.<br/><br/>20 years later, ""Toy Story"" still rocks!"

The story of this film is deeply moving, not only to focus on strong themes like loyalty and friendship but, mainly, because it mess with our fondest memories by involving toys that we all played when we were kids. Its not a coincidence that we see, in this film, toys of our parents and grandparents living with action figures and games of our time.

","Have you ever wondered if toys come alive when you aren't looking? Well, the movie Toy Story answers just that! <br/><br/>This movie has me by my heart strings. Growing up when I was a wee lad of small age and stature. I had grown in love with toys. As all small boys I imagined them being alive. So you can assume when I was a child and saw Toy Story for the first time I was off my rocker and was enamored with this glorious depiction of toys being alive. My childish mind had loved the idea of toys being alive and all the way till today. This movie is a part of me and my childhood. I have a whole box of toy story figures to prove it. <br/><br/>The film starts in a small boy's room, named Andy. It is a regular day in 1995 I'm assuming. Cardboard boxes are set up to look like an old western town. Woody, a cowboy doll and one of the main characters, voiced by Tom Hanks, is ""sheriff"" in the town. Andy is playing with his toys and pretending Hamm, a piggy bank is wreaking havoc upon the town. And Woody is there to stop him. <br/><br/>Within the first two minutes of the film, you have tasted the whole buffet of what you're getting yourself into. A story driven adventure with toys. The toys are lively, relatable and moody. The two main characters are complete opposite in all aspects. There's Woody, a sheriff cowboy, aged with years of play and kind of an old outdated toy, complete with a pull string that says ""There's a snake in my boot."" Buzz Lightyear, voiced by Tim Allen, is a space ranger of star command. He is updated with all new bells and whistles complete with a ""karate chop action,"" a laser pointer, and he glows in the dark. The antagonist is the next door neighbor kid, Sid. A creatively destructive boy that likes to blow stuff up. <br/><br/>When Buzz shows up unannounced, and threatens Woody's ""spot on the bed"" Woody is determined to get rid of him. And what ensues is a wonderful plot that is carried on with lively, entertaining characters. Supporting characters are just as special and well thought out. Mr. Potato Head, is based on the actual toy Mr. Potato head. He, of course is mad at the world and generally grumpy, probably due to the fact he gets his face knocked off many times throughout the film. Slinky, is based on the slinky with a twist of being a dog. His character is rustier and offers the maturity compared to the rest. Rex, a toy tyrannosaurus, is silly, clumsy, and the comedy relief. Hamm, a piggy bank, is the witty, one liner, know it all. Bo Peep, a doll shepherd and the love interest in the movie. Although this plays a very small role in the movie. Sarge is a veteran small plastic army man, who leads a small battalion of little green army men. Lastly there is RC, who is a remote controlled toy vehicle. He doesn't say any words in the movie except his ""revs"" he does to communicate with the others. <br/><br/>The lovable characters, and beautiful voice acting come from a diverse cast of celebrities and voice actors. The movie also pays close attention to detail to everything you expect and more! I've seen this movie over the years, well over 15 or 20 times. Each time I watch, I notice something new. For instance, I noticed some of the adult jokes in the movie earlier I had not gotten. In one of the scenes Mr. Potato Head gets frustrated and removes his mouth and touches his butt with them. As an innocent child I had disregarded this gesture as something else but in retrospect I now know that he was implying the saying ""kiss my ass"" which made me laugh out loud the first time I had gotten it. I had been so naive and innocent before. And now watching the movie with my adult ""glasses"" I have gotten a whole new look of the movie. Makes me love it even more. When it offers something to the parents as well, you know you're making an excellent movie.<br/><br/>My critiques are few and probably nit-picky. This movie is a well- rounded film and I don't have much to complain about. First off, I wish some of the supporting characters had more screen time to flesh out their personalities even more. I loved the interactions they had and I was sad to see there wasn't much of them throughout the film. Owning the Blu-Ray version of the film made me spot some technical animation errors as well. No film is without errors of course but I thought I'd mention them. The toys' feet seem to shake a tad when they walk and they seem to awkwardly float a little above the ground at times. Also the facial animations can get a bit funky and odd at times. I have no idea how difficult it is to make facial expressions animations on computer software, but I'll give them credit where credit is due. They did a fantastic job and I applaud them.<br/><br/>I am no expert on films, but I am just an average joe. A joe that knows a good entertaining movie when he sees one. There is probably more errors or more critiques that I haven't mentioned or noticed but to me the film is as good as it needs to be. To be a kid friendly toy adventure. If you're a kid at heart, I'd still recommend this movie to you. Your inner child will thank you. I know I'll be watching this one for many years to come."

","Toy Story is one of those movies which holds a lot of good childhood memories for me. I first saw it in the cinema as a child, it was then worn out on VHS tape. Played to death on DVD & is now owned on special edition Blu Ray. It is by far, one of my favourite ever movies. Everything about this movie is perfect. It is a subject which is relateable to every single person who has ever watched this film; that our toys came to life when weren't there. In Toy Story the toys don't just simply come to life, they have their own world, their own relationships, their own problems and conflicts. But above all else they have friendship, loyalty & a special togetherness. <br/><br/>The story begins with the Toys in Andy's bedroom. It is the day of Andy's birthday party and the toys gather round anxious awaiting the news as to whether a new toy has been given as a birthday present, and if it is to be Andy's new 'favourite toy'. The toy that is handed over as a present is the brand spanking new, space ranger, Buzz Lightyear. All the other toys are all in awe of him, all toys that is, expect for Woody, Andy's current favourite Toy. Woody feels threatened by Buzz and has no patience when Buzz genuinely believes that he is a real space ranger & not a toy. The story progresses sending the toys on an adventure which is like no other seen before!<br/><br/>The casting for Toy Story is simply perfect. Tom Hanks & Tim Allen put in fantastic performances as Woody & Buzz. The relationship they create is so believable and they develop fantastic chemistry throughout the film. The best thing about Toy Story is the way it manages to involve you in the film. It makes you feel all of the toys emotions & really makes you feel for them. But at the end of the day they are just toys! We shouldn't get that involved yet somehow we do! <br/><br/>Toy Story has many hidden meanings and gestures which really drive home the message of friendship and love. They are not cheesy, they are touching and realistic. This is what Disney do so well, they make children's films but whilst doing so they create them so they can be related to by adults. <br/><br/>The animation is also on the money, this movie is almost 20 years old but looks as good today on Blu Ray as any other animation. Toy Story also has one brilliant soundtrack with several songs which will stay with you long after you have watched it. Overall I cannot recommend this film enough and I would recommend anybody to go and watch it, no matter what your age.<br/><br/>A timeless classic. 10/10"

","1995's Toy Story is a work of pure imagination. It covers topics of fantasy, friendship and jealousy. It also contains relatable characters which shines out compared to other animated films. The actors were perfectly cast (Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz - the list goes on...) and the intricate plot can be compared to some of the best movies ever. I think everyone in the world has seen Toy Story, but if you haven't, it's a must see. Its by far superior to its two sequels, but they are decent. Not only is it a great film, it is historically significant, as it was the first fully 3D animated film. You HAVE TO SEE THIS... J"

","Eventually Toy Story was everything of my childhood,from the imagination and the belief that the toys would come to life,to the tongue in cheek script that get me laughing a lot,the story that makes me think and value till today on how a great story can make a huge impact to people and the likable characters that I grew up loving and having these toys as those played in my childhood.Its animation,though it was made at that time when CGI animation was just starting,or they did started the whole thing was top notch till today when I watched it in Hi Def.As it was always,it was the everything that a great movie could offer. We started with a simple yet powerful plot about a toy cowboy doll who is on top of his game,admiration and respect from his fellow toys as well as the unconditional love he has from his owner,Andy.However this has changed,only for temporary when his owner brought in a new toy that he had just got as a birthday present,a space superhero action figure and due to his arrival ,the space superhero did got every thing of admiration and love that the cowboy once have that the cowboy was always sidelined from everything.This thus turned into an outrage of jealousy that the cowboy and the space superhero ended up getting into a conflict so severe that he got pushed out of the window so that his beloved owner would not find him,however it was lucky that the space superhero survived and thus another fight occurs this time in the petrol station.They then went onto a pizza delivery truck where their owner was there and ended up again being held captive by a cruel,yet troubled neighbor named Sid who just loves to torture toys every day.And together as they were held captive,they then have to come in terms to work together in order to save themselves from the captive they were in and also to get back to their owner who they then realized have love them unconditionally,Andy which is by far one of the most realistic plot I've ever come across,though it is viewed in a toy's perspective. The movie themes itself was also powerful itself.Though it is a kids movie,it deals with themes of jealousy,abduction,cruelty and suicide as well of positive themes of leadership,cooperation,love and friendship.It is a movie that plays well with every theme so well that it deserves to be praised to its highest point.It was a movie of all genre,from horror to action to comedy and to being inspirational at all claims which most movies did not have these days.Today,we do have the various types of CGI animated movies,from the ultra good (The Incredibles,How To Train Your Dragon,Monsters Inc) to the mediocre(Rise of The Guardians,Cars,Over The Hedge,Wreck It Ralph) the ultra bad( Frozen,Brave,Turbo,Antz,Chicken Little,Shark Tale ),but none can ever come to the touch of magic that Toy Story did left in many people's hearts.Also Toy Story is also the biggest reason to every animation student on why they wanted to study animation especially 3D at the first place.Without Toy Story we would not even think that taking a leap to animation would be really very possible for many aspiring animators and film directors of that line.Overall,Toy Story,which is honesty the first animated film that I grew up watching in my life(I was four a that time), was the first that I grew up loving everything from the movie.It it quite strange that it is only later that I've realized that this hugely influential movie was released at the same year that I was born,1995 which has then installed the love of animation towards me and my whole life.And it is when I've watched this movie is that I've decided on what I've wanted to do entirely ,directing an animated movie that is as groundbreaking as Toy Story. Overall,in my personal words,it is very tough to pen a review on a movie that you've loved so much in your life and has made a great impact on your career path.Personally ,Toy Story is an amazing film that was not over-hyped,but rather talked due to its legacy and greatness from everything it has,thus it should be remembered by many generations to come.Finally,I would like to thank John Lasseter,Ed Catmull and also whoever who has been involved in the production of this wonderful movie for opening the doors to many aspiring animators out there that anyone can live the legacy that Walt Disney did formerly"

When the other toys ask for buzz woody always had an excuse and his friends found out that he wanted to rid of buzz so all his friends was really mad at buzz. His friends tried to find buzz.

","Being a monumental achievement in modern film-making, ""Toy Story"" also proves to be the greatest family film I have ever seen. It is truly a brilliant concept. Young Andy's cowboy doll Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) becomes jealous when Andy starts paying more attention to his new space toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). Buzz, however, does not grasp the fact that he's actually a toy and thinks he is a space ranger here by mistake. Hanks and Allen are the perfect voices for these characters, as are Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, and numerous others. There are more great one-liners in this film than any other family film I can recall, one of the best being Buzz's ""I don't believe that man's ever been to medical school."" I have seen this film countless times, and it has become a true classic. It's masterfully done, not only being the first fully computer animated film, but also for it's superb writing and concept. Everything about the film, from the staff meeting scene in the beginning to Buzz seeing his TV ad, is perfectly done. Randy Newman's three original songs are all excellent. ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" lost to Pochahontas' ""Colors of the Wind,"" which I also love, but I'm not sure which was better; maybe this. Anyway, see this film.

","Toy Story is awesome! When I was little, I watched it all the time because I loved it so much, and I still watch it all the time! My favorite character is Woody, because he is so funny. My favorite part of the movie was at the very end when the toys were spying on Andy's friends when they were going to Andy's party, and then all the presents started growing bigger and bigger. I think that the story was really cool because there weren't only boy toys, but girl toys, too because of Andy's little sister. The animation was great, the actors were all talented, and the whole storyline is awesome! When Andy started to like Buzz Lightyear more than Woody, I felt really sorry of Woody, but I'm glad that Andy didn't just get rid of Woody; Andy still loved all his toys, even though he liked Buzz Lightyear more for a while. I'm glad that although Woody and Buzz Lightyear seemed to be enemies at the beginning, they ended up being friends at the end.

I did get a few laughs out of the movie so I will not knock the film.<br/><br/>So what is it about the film I dislike? The toys - not the actors voicing them - the toys themselves. All of the toys except for Rex (the T. Rex toy). I did enjoy the toon Rex - he was quite the comedy act. Mr. Potato Head was OK in the film but I never liked the toy as a kid - just boring to play with.

"Spleen","7","3","13","25 September 1999"," Decent enough but no milestone
","Think of momentous years in Hollywood's history like 1927 (the year of the first talkie), 1932 (the first use of three-colour technicolor), 1935 (the first feature in full colour), and 1937 (the first animated feature).  I kept telling myself, in 1995, that I was witnessing something equally ground-breaking and historically important.  And who knows, maybe I was. The four historic films I alluded to above were `The Jazz Singer', `Flowers and Trees', `Becky Sharp' and `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', only the last of which has any claim to being a classic.  `Toy Story' has no great claim, either.  In retrospect it was nothing new, just another instance of Hollywood's current infatuation with computer-generated images: pleasant, light and unremarkable.<br/><br/>Computer animation is really a soulless device and, although I found it enjoyable, this is a soulless movie.  To begin with the animation wasn't quite ripe.  Toys, I suppose, are easy to animate: but when the flesh-and-blood children start to look as if they're also made of plastic, when the whole world seems to be made of plastic, the eye longs in vain for something else.<br/><br/>Perhaps including children at all was a mistake.  A Hans Andersen toy story, a story that concerned toys and only toys, would have been more fun (and more moving).  The film betrays itself when it starts to think of the children.  The two central characters, after all, are BAD toys - horribly gimmicky devices that children very sensibly lose interest in after not so sensibly getting their parents to buy them some other worthless gimcrack. When Woody gave his speech about how important they really were in servicing a child's dreams and wishes and whatnot ... did anyone really fall for it? It would have been much more honest if he'd said, every toy for himself, kids be damned.<br/><br/>I'm sorry if I sound overly critical - as I said, I liked it, so for me at least the slightly sour taste wasn't strong enough to ruin the film.  John Lasseter deserves credit for taking a formulaic buddy tale and breathing genuine life into it.  (All the more credit with a medium as unyielding as computer animation.)  `Toy Story' is pleasant and fun.  But frankly, every single traditionally animated film Disney has made from 1989 on, with the possible exception of `The Hunchback of Notre Dame', is better.  And - sorry to close with a carp - did Randy Newman really have to break into song so often?  Wasn't it enough for him to write the score, without croaking his songs out over it?"

","After hearing about the success of the toy story series, a rented a DVD which had a collection of Toy Story 1, Toy Story 2 and Monsters Inc. I loved Monsters Inc. and Toy Story 2 but I did not enjoy Toy Story 1 even that much. These were the points that I didn't like in the movie: 1) In the starting, when Andy is shown playing with the toys, he starts to get a bit annoying after he keeps on playing with it. His love for the toys throughout the film bugged me after a while. But I did not find this too boring as even my cousin is a great fan of Spiderman and keeps buying and playing with the toys.<br/><br/>2) The animation looked a bit faded in the movie. But I didn't pay much attention towards it giving an excuse that it was made in 1995 and compared to Finding Nemo and the other new movies, its animation would be a bit duller.<br/><br/>3) Sorry Tom Hanks, but I found your character quite annoying in the film as you kept screaming like a mad character and I did not like you that much.<br/><br/>4) Woody's girlfriend in the movie had a terrible voice. I expected a cute shepherdess's voice to be more cute and sweet rather that being a bit rough and sounding like the second woman in a love story.<br/><br/>5) Mr.Potato head and the other characters, except for the spring dog, really annoyed me when they were reluctant to listen to Woody. I mean, why couldn't they just wait and understand him.<br/><br/>6) The bad boy removed some parts of his toys to make them look terrible. But towards the end, when the toys help Woody and Buzz, Woody thanks them and just leaves. Why didn't he tell the toys to leave that stupid place and run away with them? They should have included these characters in the second film, at least.<br/><br/>7) Toys had lives in the movie. So why did they not just start living alive with the humans? Why do they fall still when their masters came? They could play alive with them.<br/><br/>The movie had some good points too. Here are some of them: 1) Tim Allen has done a fantastic voicing as Buzz, and I liked Buzz in the movie as he was shown brave, his voicing was done well and he didn't bore me at all.<br/><br/>2) The dog who supported Woody was cute and I liked him, just, I liked him, in the movie.<br/><br/>3) The movie was different from other movies, as here, toys were shown as the protagonists.<br/><br/>4) The dinosaur was funny and his character uplifted the film.<br/><br/>Overall, I don't think it deserves to be in the top 250 movies. But its the people's choice and if they wish that it would be in the top 250, then I can do nothing but give my review on the film."

","Afraid this doesn't really hold up that well. You hear so much about great wit, but that comes only in short fits, a few good lines here and there. I know they're toys, but the characters in ""Toy Story"" largely suffer from the sort of super-quirk ""Juno"" and ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and the lot suffer from. It's basically really quirky toys talking to each other and facing acts of villainy and committing acts of heroism for an hour and a half. The animation is impressive considering when it was made but unlike hand-drawn animation from the old Disney films it HAS dated, and noticeably, often looking like a video game cutscene now. The voice work is fine, but there's just nothing truly interesting about this world or these characters. It's a pleasant enough movie and occasionally very fun, but the overwhelming affection for it seems to me the result of nostalgia and memory rather than any lasting value. Compared to the rip-roaring adventure of ""The Incredibles"", the spine-tingling melancholy tone and sophisticated ideas of ""WALL-E"", or the sense of longing and loss and adventure in ""Up"", ""Toy Story"" falls short. Very short. In fact, I'd much rather take the small-town nostalgia of ""Cars"" over this. A good starting point for Pixar but nothing even remotely approaching a classic."

In my younger days I used to wonder if toys could really talk. This movie brings out that imagination to life and creates a magical world in which toys are alive. This movie does a really good job in exploring the fantasy and imagination of children and their toys. All of the characters fit really well and this movie should be a classic for many years to come.

Not only is the film irresistibly funny it is also has a clever story and unlike many movies of today you can watch this one over and over. The voices are done by a host of popular names that we all know and love. Some of the most popular being Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, and John Ratzenberger as Hamm. Jim Varney even lends his hilarious voice as Slinky the Dog. The story is about a boy (Andy) that gets a new toy (Buzz Lightyear) for his birthday. Andy's previous favorite toy (Woody) feels forgotten. After a series of mis-adventures the two find themselves away from the home and must learn to work together to find their way back.

All in all, this movie is immature in how it represents the generational changes to the proposed demographic, which seems to be 2 year olds. I don't think this movie did anything for animation, and the Hungarian animation of the mid 90s is more important than this piece of windows 95 trash."

","Amazing! I have just seen Toy Story. The first one. For the first time. And it's like I'm seeing it back in the days before Toy Story 2 got out on the big screen. The only thing I wouldn't have known was the future story of Apple Inc.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful one hour advertisement where you can see branded toys. The only thing that is original in this one hour waste is the way Steve Jobs' employees created a toy universe. It was so yesterday to create a new line of cheap plastics than do some silly adventure. It was called an adventure so people won't have any issue leaving the children alone for one or two hours of advertisements. It sounds so much more educative to have cartoon adventure instead of having cartoon characters selling you stuff. And, instead of a real actor, the cartoon has precisely zero morals: it can sell plutonium to a 5 year old or to some radical terrorist group without blinking. Unless the art director thinks the blink would raise the quantity at least 10 percent.<br/><br/>Now about the creative part. Steve Jobs' employees never bothered to create something like say Hanna-Barbera. They just pushed older toys into this new advertisement. And here's where the creativity ends.<br/><br/>What's even better is the world imagined. A world where children are isolated. Where they depend on their branded toys. And watch out for the bad kid! He is real creative. But the toys are working together to bring back what the lower case 'c' in a circle meant: a toy identical with million others on the shelves. Oh! And don't forget! A good kid would preserve all the junk: large useless wasteful boxes with advertisements for the whole line of plastic somethings.<br/><br/>Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch"

","Toy Story was a breakthrough movie in film history. Modern animation and children's story telling would not be where it is today without it and I give it full credit for that. However, I don't think Toy Story has aged well.<br/><br/>Toy Story works off the premise that toys come to life when the kids that own them aren't looking. Bloody brilliant. Pure genius. This is the best part about Toy Story. And it has some of the most famous lines in cinema history.<br/><br/>However, we spend a very large portion of Toy Story trying to convince Buzz that he is in fact a toy. And very little else happens. It just feels repetitive and very one note. The ""villain"" is supposed to be creepy but comes across lame and weird.<br/><br/>The thing that I personally love about this franchise is the amazing set of fully realised side characters. But when I rewatched Toy Story, I discovered that they really do not play a part at all in this movie. Rex, Ham, Mr Potato Head, Slinky, barely show up and that really disappointed me.<br/><br/>Overall, Toy Story is good and is a really enjoyable family film. However, the newer instalments are the real draw to Pixar."

"vharrington-53006","7","0","1","26 April 2017"," Film Review of Toy Story
","The movie Toy Story is an animated film about the life of toys and their struggle to be kept by children. The story starts with a child named Andy whose favorite toy is a cowboy sheriff named, Woody (voice by Tom Hanks), and their inseparable bond. For years, Woody is Andy's number one toy, until one birthday Andy is given a new play pal, Buzz Lightyear, (voice by Tim Allen). Immediately, Woody is aware that Buzz is taking his place as the favorite toy and becomes jealous. Woody's plan to get rid of Buzz eventually leads to the both of them being far away from home and in the hands of Sid, the child toy terrorizer who lives next door. In the end, the two work together and make it back to Andy's house. Woody realizes that he will not always be Andy's favorite and becomes friends with Buzz. The overall theme of the film is accepting change and understand that sometimes it is a good thing. Woody was so worried about being replaced that he did not see a good person (toy rather) in Buzz. The next-door neighbor kid, Sid, also learned a valuable lesson in this film. He spent all of his time torturing and destroying toys as a way of having fun, but finally got what was coming to him when he seen that toys come to life. Another teachable moment was with Mr. Potato Head; one of Andy's toys, and his trust issues with Woody. Throughout the film, Mr. Potato Head constantly lacked faith in Woody and always gave a negative comment about what Woody wanted to do. Once Woody and Buzz teamed up, the other toys and Mr. Potato Head were convinced that Woody was right. Out of everyone, Buzz learned the biggest lesson; never give up on your dreams. Buzz did not comprehend that he was not really a space ranger and could not r fly. When Woody told Buzz that he was just a toy, Buzz did not believe it until he saw the commercial. Yet, he still got to ride his rocket and fly through the skies. Watching Toy Story and all of the messages that it displayed reminded me of one of my favorite films Dead Presidents. Everyone is going through the same journey, but have a different perspective on the situation. All of the characters have a diverse outcome of the lesson and they take an important life learning experience with them. The film was strictly a kid's movie, so the lighting was very bright and colorful. This worked well with the theme, because what easily influences kids are the things they see and hear. Having those cheerful images and giving a positive insight helps the children understand messages in a fun way. Many of the angles in the film were close ups of the characters faces, giving you great detail of the animated work done by the editors. Every expression was shown as if they were real people, and you could almost feel what the characters were going through. Andy's happy face, Sid's mean face and Buzz's sad face; all right there so you could relate to the emotion. I think it is cute and inspiring to young children to receive a good message in any film. Animated films have always been seen as funny and playful, but they do teach a lesson at some point. It may not be major, but it tells the audience something that they want to put out there, and most of the time that one message can grow into many different opinions; not everyone thinks the same."
"nickscheetz","10","0","1","18 April 2017"," Pixar's overall #1 best, one of the best parts of my childhood, overall best animated film, and one of the best films in general as well
","Toy Story is the very first animated film ever made in history, it's the overall best and set the bar high for plenty of future computer animated films in general for a lot of good reasons. Pixar's first film takes place in a world where toys come alive when nobody is around, the story centers around a pull string cowboy doll named Woody who's voiced by Tom Hanks, he's the favorite toy of a young boy named Andy, but that changes when Andy gets a new action figure for his birthday, that particular toy is Buzz Lightyear who is voiced by Tim Allen, Buzz wins all the attention which makes Woody inevitably jealous and forces him to try to get rid of Buzz, resulting in them getting separated from Andy, therefore, they must put their differences aside and try to get back to Andy before him and his family move to their new house. With great writers like John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Joe Ranft, and Joss Whedon, the story as a whole needs nothing more and nothing less, it's just right, every scene advances the story forward. The characters are all memorable, the Pizza Planet aliens, the cowardly Rex voiced by Wallace Shawn, the know-it-all Hamm the piggy bank voiced by John Ratzenberger, the loyal Slinky-Dog voiced by Jim Varney, and the sassy and rude but always hilarious Mr. Potato-Head who's voiced by Don Rickles. But the best characters are the two main protagonists, Buzz Lightyear is a character that took a life of his own and became a pop-cultural phenomenon over night, even getting his own TV show, in fact in December 1995 every child on the planet wanted a Buzz Lightyear action figure, which is what Buzz represents the toy we all wanted when we were kids but weren't lucky enough to get, the ultimate action hero of the ultimate hero, and on top of all that casting Tim Allen to do his voice is by far one the best voice over performances of all time. Then there's Woody, Tom Hanks' performance as the sheriff of these parts was outrageously flawless, he's an old soul and his case is quite literal, considering he is a toy from the early generation which we didn't grow up in, but he is probably the character we can relate to the most. As for the best scene, the end of the final chase scene when Buzz and Woody are flying through the air after almost being blown up by a rocket: Woody: Hey Buzz you're flying! Buzz: this isn't flying, this is falling with style! Where Buzz finally achieves what he knew he could do from the start and Woody can put his doubts aside. Get the family together and get ready to go as Buzz and Woody put it ""TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!"""

","""Reach for the sky""! The opening statement of Woody (Hanks) a toy cowboy during a boys playtime. A statement that proves to be ironic when he later looks up at a toy from space, Buzz Lightyear (Allen). Woody's owner is growing older and Woody struggles to accept the change as Buzz becomes Andy's new favourite toy. Leading from the once strong leader into a bout of jealousy and even malice as he tries to take Buzz out of the picture. Woody is then separated from Andy via a fight with Buzz and has to find a way home. Further change occurs as Woody is forced to align with Buzz to escape the toy antagonist Sid. It takes 3/4 of the movie for Woody to finally change his ways, and work with Buzz for the final great escape. <br/><br/>Woody's journey from leader to outcast to redemption is intriguing to watch unfold. His final monologue with Sid was beautifully written as the toy out wits the boy. The whole irony of his story is that a child's mind is fleeting and 10 minutes of playing with Buzz and Woody would have been in the game again.<br/><br/>For me it is Buzz that follows the greater path of change. Noble and confident throughout mostly due to being under the illusion he is an actual space ranger. Kudos to the writer who decided to take a toy from this world and make him believe he is real! Simple but incredibly compelling. Buzz's final realisation that he is a toy is arm breaking for him but heartbreaking for us. For a family movie Buzz's breakdown is surprising and well delivered and the journey back to being he hero has Buzz literally ""Reaching for the sky"". With us the viewers figuratively as we are up there with them cheering the final events. <br/><br/>Woody and Buzz's journey home is supported by a cast of toys, each with a filled out personality. Loyal Slinky being one of my favourites, always reluctant to turn on his buddy Woody like the others. <br/><br/>It's the direction of John Lasseter that puts us into this world. When Woody shouts ""You are a toy"". It's John speaking to us. From the beginning the camera is at ground level. We are not supposed to be a child watching his toys come to life but an actual toy, low level shots panning up throughout give a feel to the vastness of a toys world. We are right there through each playtime, adventure, triumph and failure and by the end Buzz may be flying but we are falling for these toys, in style. <br/><br/>The story and characters are a success but the triumph is the medium in which the story is told. Through 3d animation, never before seen feature length. The Pixar animators made a bedroom and a pizza planet truly realistic. They brought toys to life in movement and texture. But most astonishing of all, they made us care for a bunch of 3d shapes put together through countless hours of rendering in a computer. The result is a metaphor for change, not just in the story itself and it's characters but in the medium it is told. The great change from 2d to 3d animation which is now common place for feature animation.<br/><br/>This movie is a game changer for cinema and animation alike. Walt Disney and co did it in 1938. 54 years later John Lasseter and co did it again. The possibilities for 3d animation in film are Infinite, and Beyond...?"

The songs by Randy Newman are not too intrusive and actually enhance the story and move it on too. The amount of work that must have gone into the brainstorming before production started must have been amazing. It would have been great to have an insight into all that. Everyone should be made to watch this - it has a lot to say about life and relationships."

","I watched this movie when I was an elementary student for the first time. That time, I only thought that toys are cute, or something like that. However, this film contains moral meaning, and I have not realize it until I become an adult. This film tells us the importance of things. These days, people have many things. It means we are rich. However, it's only the abundance of objective things. In toy story, a boy with many toys but does not have heart to treat toys dearly is suppose to be punished. This suggests the situation of modern society, and reminds us the importance to treat things carefully. Another point that I like in this film is, the growth of the cowboy. When he meets Buzz for the first time, he did not accept Buzz, because he couldn't understand everything about Buzz. Moreover, his position was taken over because of Buzz's appearance. However, he learns the importance of understanding other people, through the adventure to return to home. Also, Buzz finally comes to understand Woody. This means that we can understand each other even if the existence is in contrast."

","Toy Story was the movie to put Pixar on the map. In 1995, John Lasseter released a mega hit upon the world with one of the best computer animated movies of all time. It launched a huge career for the studio, dropping hit after hit even to this day. This is the story of a toy named Woody (Tom Hanks), a Cowboy Sheriff toy with a pull string voice box. He is owner Andy's favorite toy. But Andy gets a new toy in the form of a space ranger named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who actually believes he is Buzz, not a toy. Woody starts to feel left out and replaced. In an attempt to remain the favorite, Woody knocks Buzz out a window. The other toy's commit mutiny on him because this, and Woody goes out into the big, scary human world to bring Buzz back. The 2 toys adventure together eventually leads them to neighbor Sid's house, where the must escape before Sid's favorite pastime of blowing up toys turns on them. This movie was a pure stroke of genius. It showed off the technology computers could all have, and what the future of animation could be. Choosing toys as the focus was smart, because the animation was still fairly new, and therefore still a little plastic looking. So toys, which should look artificial, seemed to look decent. The voice acting in this movie is fantastic too. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen play well off each other and provide great characters. Woody's jealousy and angry outbursts contrasts well with Buzz's conceited yet naive nature. The supporting cast give great performances as well, and allow the toys to each have their own distinct personalities which, when put together, make them feel like a family. The soundtrack of this movie was done by Randy Newman, who made one the most sugary songs that I love. ""You Got a Friend in Me"" is known by most, as it is the quintessential Toy Story song. It is like a theme song to everything this movie is. The ultimate friendship between a human and his toys, but also between two life- long buddies. This movie promoted love, imagination, and friendship. It was a kids film that adults could relate to. It was everything that Pixar continues to stand on today. And everyone should see it. I give this film a 10/10. PS: Because this is Pixar, I gotta mention the good luck charm. In this film John Ratzenberger plays Hamm, the piggy bank. He's a fun character with good quips. One of my favorites he did."

","Toy Story, as the first completely CGI animated movie, is still timeless in plenty of ways and is enjoyed by anyone who can say they like animation. I am one of them. The animation is of course crude by today's standards, but it was made in a way that makes it seem like 1995 wasn't that long ago. As dated as it looks, we can still appreciate it for being more than just a test of what computers could render. As for complaints, the jokes could have been funnier and the story could have less instances of convenience, like how Buzz and Woody enter the Pizza Planet Truck and come across a nice, high pile of pizza boxes to hide behind. There were also some errors in the anatomy of some toys, like RC. I won't take points off for the animation because hey, it was 1995 and Pixar had up to that point only been making shorts for 11 years, so it isn't something to grouch over (even though there were some superficial glitches like disappearing lights between scenes). All I can say is, see it soon and brace for a higher intrigue of the early history of CGI."

"TanicaH","9","0","1","2 May 2016"," Toy Story and the Imagination
","The film Toy Story is an animation film that changed the movie game with its technological advances used to create this bold, colorful computerized animation. Toy Story is about a boy named Andy and his love for his toys. Andy's favorite toys have a huge secret that he is not aware of, they are actually alive and become real when no one is around. Andy has a favorite toy cowboy named Woody who is the Sheriff and leader of all the other toys. Woody pride himself on being Andy's favorite toy, but that title is challenged when Andy has a birthday party and receives a new space ranger toy Buzz Light Year. In the scene that introduces Buzz Light Year, it is kind of symbolic that the new toy may be a replacement for the old cowboy Woody. As the kids rush in the room the day of Andy's birthday party Woody is thrown under the bed, and Buzz Light Year is placed on the bed in Woody's spot.<br/><br/>Time goes by as Randy Newman's song ""You got a friend in me"" plays as the soundtrack during various scenes as Andy becomes more involved with Buzz, eventually pushing Woody to the background. The lyrics to the song could be considered an ironic montage to the mood that Woody feels during these scenes, because he is lonely and feels replaced. Buzz on the other hand is indulging in the admiration that he receives from Andy. The soundtrack to this movie as awesome, because the lyrics of the songs played like, ""you got a friend in me"", ""strange things"", and ""pop goes the weasel"". Those songs can replace the dialogue in the scenes and the audience will still be able to follow on.<br/><br/>At Pizza Planet there is some tension between the two toys Buzz and Woody, which causes them to end up with the neighbor kid Sid, who is known to destroy his toys. Once the movie reaches this climax the characters positions change. Woody and Buzz are forced to reconcile and work together in the quest to return home.<br/><br/>The special effects and graphics used in this animation were phenomenal. The camera angles, digital character movements, even facial expressions, helped bring the toys in the film to life. Although this film theme was surrounded by the dynamic relationship between alpha toys Woody and Buzz Light Year. The supporting characters, the relationships displayed between Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, the comedic scenes with Rex the Dinosaur and Slinky the Dog made the film more entertaining and realistic. Toy Story is a must see film for all children who has a love for toys. Watching this film will enhance a new found respect for the creativity of children's imagination."

","This was perhaps what you would get when you combine toys in cartoons with writing from Fox's King of the Hill. The acting's great, the writing's great, and the characters are great, except the toy destroyer. But at least karma bit Sid really badly when his mutant toys turned the tables on him. I was impressed by the characters in this movie, the toy jokes are great in the movie, even the innuendo is used correctly. Even the way the toys interact like human beings in the film, makes it feel like you're watching real people instead of characters and toys.<br/><br/>I was mostly impressed by the story, the way it was written. It's not written out like a little kid's imagination, it's well written, it's funny, it's emotional, and the best part, in the 50's, when Sputnik was launched, astronauts stole the spotlight from Cowboy westerns. Even the score's really great, I enjoyed the score even the songs, my only complaint was the Ms. Nesbitt routine, once Buzz came to his senses and helped Woody, the scene proved to be not really that funny.<br/><br/>The cast was great, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Wallace Shawn, Jim Varney, John Ratzenburger, Don Rickles, Annie Potts, John Morris, Erik Von Detten, everyone was great in the film, they sound believable and likable.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Toy Story not only gives us a moral to learn when Woody and Buzz became the best of friends, when it comes to life, there is no favorite, all that matters that Woody and Buzz and all your favorite toys will be there for Andy when he needs him. And nothing could test Buzz and Woody's friendship............just wait."

","After all of Pixar's feature-length masterpieces, (Finding Nemo, The Incredibles etc.) ""Toy Story"" still manages to be not only my favorite Pixar film but one of my favorite films of all time. One of the primary aspects of the film that still resonates with me to this day, is the depth of the characterization that goes far beyond your average film. Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Hamm, Rex, Slinky, Mr. Potato Head, the Green Army Men, Andy, Sid, and the entire toy community are all fleshed out characters that always have something witty or insightful to say about the situations they find themselves in. All in all, ""Toy Story"" will always hold a special place in my heart as it was the first Pixar film I saw and held the most immediately memorable characters.

","Pixar knocks it out of the park with its first feature film, about friendship, jealousy and the capriciousness of privileged white kids in a society of disposability. A clever, sharp and imaginative screenplay expertly voiced by a stellar cast (I would give this 5/10 just for casting Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head) keeps the swiftly moving story engaging throughout, flagging only a bit when self- deluded toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) is briefly depressed. The film hops from one great set-piece to the next with head-spinning speed that leaves me marveling at how simple director John Lasseter and the team of animators make it look to bring these toys to life with just a few touches of individuality. Every viewer will probably have their favorite parts. Back when I first saw the movie upon its initial release, mine was the new-age toys who worship the Claw; upon recent viewing, I think it is ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" rendition of evil neighbor Sid's bedroom. It's hard to remember now that Pixar has proved so successful that there was real doubt about whether its style of computer-graphics animation would be embraced by audiences -- kudos to Pixar for proving the doubters wrong."

It is a film for families that will appeal on different grounds depending on age. It regards a cowboy named Woody and the jealousy that erupts when Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear enters the room on their owner's birthday. Buzz is interesting because he doesn't realize that he is a toy. When Woody causes Buzz to fall out a window an adventure begins that eventually lands them both in nasty Sid's bedroom from next door where a dire fate awaits toys. Grand idea with imaginative filmmaking by director John Lasseter. Where the film goes wrong is its placing supporting characters as types with little purpose. The two leads carry the film with Tom Hanks voicing Woody who goes from important to jealousy to hero in an exciting climax. Tim Allen as Buzz brings much humour in his inability to accept what he is. There is a host of other toys that seem more like fillers. Don Rickles voices Mr. Potato Head and Wallace Shawn voices T-Rex. Jim Varney of Ernest P. Worrell fame voices the loyal Slinky Dog.

Everyone has seen this movie before its probably the best Pixar movie to date since the mid 1990s. The story is about Woody the cowboy(voiced by Tom Hanks)who is a toy along with many other toys that come to life when no one is in the room. All of the toys are owned by Andy a young boy who lives with his mom and his sister. So on the eve of Andy's birthday he ends up getting a new toy,the Buzz Lightyear toy which is a very popular toy who is a space ranger. So when Woody is introduced to Buzz Lightyear(voiced by Tim Allen)Woody ends up being jealous of him and he would do anything to be the center of attention again. But when a rough kid who lives next door accidentally gets Woody and Buzz out of a cash rending machine its up to Woody and Buzz to escape Sid's house.<br/><br/>Overall this was a very original authentic masterpiece. The story is very good,the music is great,the charcthers are engaging and the whole set up is fantastic.

Buzz's realization that he is just another product to be sold in the world, is in my opinion, one of the greatest moments of movie and entertainment history. The movie gives you a lot of things to speculate on like is Woody a bad toy? Or can a movie have virtually no villain but the hero or at all?

","Disney/Pixar initiated a new sophisticated form of animation with the 1995 box office smash Toy Story, a richly entertaining and imaginative animated adventure that not only spawned two sequels, but became a merchandising dream.<br/><br/>The film opens in the bedroom of a little boy named Andy who is moving in a couple of days. The central characters are Andy's toys, who are led by a cowboy action figure named Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), who is apparently Andy's favorite toy. Woody and the other toys feel seriously threatened when Andy receives a space action figure called Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) for his birthday. Immediate antagonism materializes between Woody and Buzz when Woody feels he might be replaced in Andy's heart, but Woody and Buzz are forced to bond and actually become friends when they become prisoners of Andy's next door neighbor, Sid, a sadistic little kid who likes to torture toys.<br/><br/>This deliciously imaginative story works thanks to a brilliant screenplay that brings vivid and believable emotions to toys, effectively showcasing the world from a toy's point of view. The jealousy and resentment between Woody and Buzz rings completely true and is actually the glue that keeps this story moving. Though the story provides consistent laughs, there are a couple of poignant moments as well...watch when Andy stops sleeping with Woody, who gets demoted from Andy's bed to the toy box or watch when Buzz sees a commercial for himself and finally realizes that he is a toy and is not real.<br/><br/>As always with Disney animated films, the voice casting is perfection, with standout work from Hanks, whose work here rivals the voice work of Robin Williams in Aladdin...he makes us love and care for Woody and puts us in his corner from jump. Mention should also be made of Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Jim Varney as the Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as a very insecure toy dinosaur, John Ratzenberger as a piggy bank named Ham, and R. Lee Ermey as a toy soldier. Really liked Annie Potts as a Little Bo Peep doll too, though I just couldn't get past my trouble with the fact that a little boy would own a Little Bo Peep doll, but I did not allow this to deter my enjoyment here.<br/><br/>Randy Newman contributed a couple of nice songs to the film, one of which, ""You've Got a Friend"", received an Oscar nomination. John Lasseter's direction and his contribution to the Oscar nominated screenplay are the final touches to this entertaining adventure that actually conjured up images of Spielberg work like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future, and though the story does have a couple of extra endings, it is a richly entertaining fantasy adventure that had me laughing and smiling throughout the entire running time."

","In 1989, Disney's The Little Mermaid became a success and launched what is known to be a Disney Renaissance. While The Rescuers Down Under underperformed, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King later became big hits. Unfortunately, Pocahontas, while turning a decent profit, didn't do that well with critics. Because of that, Disney needed some help. <br/><br/>They managed to co-produce with a CGI animation company known as Pixar to release their very first computer animated feature known as ""Toy Story"", a story about a cowboy doll named Woody who becomes jealous when a new space toy named Buzz Lightyear becomes top toy to his owner named Andy. One day, when Woody knocks Buzz out the window, he becomes despised and after reuniting with Buzz, they get separated from their owner and end up in a house owned by Sid, a boy next door who destroys toys for fun. Because of that, they need to come up with a plan to make it out alive. But first they need to overcome their differences in order to do so. I remembered seeing this film as a child on VHS and loved it. Twenty years later, it's still a beloved classic and there are a lot of things to talk about. <br/><br/>First off, the story is very well-written. It displays some themes of jealousy, friendship, being a toy that makes you special to your owner, and what it means to go Infinity and Beyond. Also, it has some of the best comedy I've ever seen as it has lots of laugh out loud moments including a scene where Buzz starts acting a bit crazy after pretending to drink some tea with some dolls in the ""I'm Mrs Nesbitt"" sequence and the ""You Are A Toy"" where Woody shouts at him that he is a child's play thing and Buzz replies ""You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity. *makes a Vulcan gesture* Farewell. However, the most important thing about the story is it's heart and it's moments are handled really well. Like the scene where Buzz realizes that he's nothing but a toy which leads to the song ""I Will Go Sailing No More"" from Randy Newman which would leave everyone in tears, but the most important scene in the movie is the iconic ""To Infinity and Beyond"" sequence where Buzz and Woody are flying in the sky after freeing themselves from a rocket. That scene itself is and always will be the most epic part in animation history. <br/><br/>There's a lot more good things to discuss as well like the animation. I'll admit it doesn't hold up that well after twenty years due to some of the human character animation that look like toys than actual human beings. But to it's credit, this was Pixar's first computer animated movie and some of the animation in Toy Story works to it's advantage. Like the textures of all of the toys and some incredible details like that spoon (seriously, it looks really neat). The pacing is very brisk. At it's 81 minute length, it's never too fast, but it's never too slow either and it takes it's time to let the dialog flow and it does it perfectly. The music score from Randy Newman is really beautiful and well-composed with it's light-hearted tone while balancing it with it's serious moments and the songs are really good. Whether you love Randy Newman or hate him, you can tell that he's actually a good singer and his songs ""You've Got A Friend In Me"" and ""I Will Go Sailing No More"" hit the right notes by being memorable songs. <br/><br/>Then, there's the voice acting and it's really spot on. Tom Hanks does a fantastic job as Woody, a cowboy doll with his wit, sympathy, and realizes that others are important to Andy as he is. Tim Allen is great as Buzz Lightyear, a space toy with wit and confusion as he figures out whether he's important to Andy or not. Their chemistry together is the heart of the movie since it's a tale about putting aside each other's differences and working together which strengthens it to it's advantage. The side characters, including Bo Peep, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Slinky, and Rex, voiced by Annie Potts, Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney and Wallace Shawn are never annoying and are very funny. The human characters are also good too and Sid, while nothing special as a Pixar villain, is still very menacing he reminds you of a bully at high school. <br/><br/>Toy Story started the trend of computer animated films and other production companies such as DreamWorks Animation, Blue Sky Studios, and Illumination Entertainment to do the same. While some of them rely on style over substance, there are some that had the same heart and creativity and competed against Pixar for nearly two decades and it's still going as of today. Toy Story and later films such as Monsters INC, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up is what made Pixar so compelling because of their heart that helped them earn their critical acclaim. What I'm trying to say here is that computer animation is what made the industry so successful it convinced Pixar to do the same in the late 2000s' which they also succeeded. Not because of the writing, not because of the characters, and not because of their heart, but because of one thing: imagination. It convinced DreamWorks Animation to do the same and they lived up to them just that on movies such as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How To Train Your Dragon. <br/><br/>So, overall, Toy Story is not only one of the best Pixar animated films ever made, but one of the best CGI animated films that will always go To Infinity and Beyond forever. My thumbs up to Pixar and Happy 20th Birthday."

It's the kind of movie that only after do you really understand how Woody feels and how Buzz feels, you also realise how easy it would be to watch it again because it's really a calm but also an exciting watch. It's hard to call this a kid's movie owing to the fact that all fans of this back in the day are fully grown adults now, but the fact that they still return to this and say it is a masterpiece even today, well it shows how impressive this really is as well.<br/><br/>The story is of course about toys, and in particular a new toy arriving because Andy the toys owner got a new Space Ranger named Buzz Lightyear for his birthday. Woody the favourite toy of Andy is jealous of Buzz's new found fame among all the other toys and starts to both feel angry but also kind of obsolete as well. The story moves along at a frantic pace, the amount of things that happen though to say this has an 81 minute run time is amazing and the timing is absolutely wonderful. Another point I found only after thinking back on the movie was the humour and how is just really good, one moment in a certain pizza restaurant arcade where we see a ""Whack-a-Alien"" game in reference to ""Alien"" sums up the overly kidult tone this movie possesses. <br/><br/>Among the voices we have Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz, Don Rickles as a small potato toy, Wallace Shawn in his trademark voice as Rex the dinosaur toy and the smoky voice of Jim Varney as Slinky the well, slinky toy dog. The voices are very memorable and the voice cast are perfectly picked, none seem out of place and maybe that is because of how much this movie has dug itself into film culture. I found Hanks and Allen's voices to be at the same level as each other only because they are both so great, Buzz is made even more courageous sounding by Allen and Hanks provides a kind of cool kind of toy voice but also brings out Woody's scared side or angry side well.<br/><br/>John Lasseter the director is among many names behind this movie who seem to all hit the right spot with this, they create the first animated feature length picture and turn it into one of the still most popular of them all. The writers hit the movie from another flank, Lasseter brings humour out from his vision but I think the writers, Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow really bring another face to the movie where the humour but also the emotion can mix really well. As animation goes it of course does not look as it maybe did back then (still isn't bad though), although it doesn't matter anyway because it is the storytelling that blows you away and the characters really grab your attention. <br/><br/>Pixar kicked off their stellar works in animated movies in style and brought not only a new way of making a movie, but also a fine way of telling a story and not making it over the top or just for kids, this is for everyone. There isn't too much too find wrong with this I mean, maybe some of the jokes aren't great, but really they may be still good anyway, it is kind of a movie that you can easily watch again without feeling it will quickly become boring, the kind of movie that is fun for quite literally, all the family."

","This was Pixar's first feature-length film, the first full-length computer-animated feature film and the first film in the Toy Story series. There will be spoilers ahead: <br/><br/>I could just say that this is a phenomenal film, a ground-breaking film and a must watch if you love film in general and/or animation in particular and leave it at that, but this comment would be rather thin if I did so, so I'll do a bit more here.<br/><br/>I don't really need to discuss the plot, because, chances are, if you're reading this, you've probably seen this already. I'll do a brief sketch: this concerns a boy named Andy and his toys. Lifeless when humans are around, the toys come to life when none are in the room. Woody is the leader of the toys, but his place is threatened by a new toy, Buzz Lightyear. Andy and family are preparing to move. Through a series of mishaps, Woody and Buzz wind up being lost and must make their way back before the family leaves or be separated from Andy forever. After a series of adventures, they make it back and get on board before the family is gone.<br/><br/>That's a simple story. The parts of the film are each so excellently crafted that it takes a simple story and creates gold. The animation still holds up, even after 20 years, which is an eternity in computer animation. The script is marvelous and the writers clearly show that they possess a love for both toys and film. The toys showing up in here are a mix of new (Woody and Buzz) and classic (Mr. Potatohead, Etch-a-Sketch and green army soldiers). There are gags referencing films as diverse as Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Wizard of Oz. Pixar also references the various shorts they'd made up to that point and TV shows like Star Trek and The Simpsons.<br/><br/>The voice casting is spot on. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen nailed their parts. Don Rickles and Jim Varney were inspired casting choices and John Ratzenberger began an association with Pixar which continues today. The score and songs by Randy Newman are perfect, particularly the song, ""You've Got a Friend In Me"", which goes to the heart of the film. It's just an exceptional film.<br/><br/>The attention to detail is incredible. Even minor characters turn out to have a significant influence on things, like the mutant toys in Sid's bedroom (Sid and his dog Scud are the villains here, Sid being a rather twisted kid next door). The look of everything is astonishing, though it has aged in 20 years.<br/><br/>This film is available on DVD/Blu-Ray is is well worth getting. Most highly recommended."

","I loved this film. For me, this is the best animated movie of all time. I think the story is very heartfelt and captures the relationship between a young boy and his toys really well. It has a universal message that applies to all ages: love. I think they did a great job with the range of characters, too; Each one brings a different perspective/attitude that really crosses over into real life whilst maintaining true to their toy-personality. This movie has good elements of comedy and drama, good guys/bad guys, heroes and aliens. It is a feel-good, timeless movie that will be relevant for generations to come."

The story is amazing and it took four creative screenwriters to write a good animated comedy film and it was just awesome to bring on screen.<br/><br/>Do I really want to talk about this film so much? No. The acting in the film is cool and I think Tom Hanks and Tim Allen did great jobs as Woody and Buzz Lightyear and there are other voice actors including Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Annie Potts and Jim Varney as Slinky Dog and they all do great jobs in their performances.<br/><br/>The music by David Newman is really amazing and the Oscar song, ""You Got a Friend in Me"", has been known as the Toy Story film series' theme song and it is performed by David Newman. The editing and animation looks very amazing and so fantastic and spectacular that I can't stop watching this film.<br/><br/>The characters and setting is really amazing and just cool.

"CMTiago","9","0","1","11 September 2015"," The one that started it all
","In my love for movies, I have come across various types of movies that feel very special to me, but there is one production company in particular that resonates closely to my heart. Pixar is that company and the animation powerhouse of the industry. In 1995, they ventured into their first movie feature with Toy Story, the first movie to be 100% made by computer effects. This of course gives the movie an iconic status in cinema history.<br/><br/>The story is about toys that come to life when we aren't watching and in this case, we see Woody (Tom Hanks), a cowboy doll cope with the arrival of a newer toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). For such an innovative film, the plot might seem quite basic. Still, this works pretty well for the movie, as a good buddy story ended up being a fitting way to introduce us to this world. Future installments would tackle more intricate themes of toys having ""souls"" and their ultimate relationship with humans and specially children. However, the first adventure is still fondly remembered as a feel good movie for all ages that entertains to a great extent. In retrospect, we now know that this little movie was the start of a great series of films (with some duds along the way as well). And what a great start it was.<br/><br/>Rating: 9,5/10"

","This piece of art definitely indicated what is Pixar capable of. Such a great blend of animation, characters and story. A classic that I keep watching over and over again - mostly synchronized to local languages. Still, guys who did the voice-overs did a great job. A rather simple story, but spiced with so much details. It also covers many views of childhood, kids' imagination, family and yes - it brings messages about friendship, jealousy and trust. Every single toy got character and is equipped with specific character attributes: one big toy is actually sensitive, another is grumpy and cynical, then there is a toy not realizing it's actually a toy and so on. There is not a single boring part. Houmor suits both kids' and adults' sense and there is a plenty of intelligent details about toys features. Sequels are also great, but this one set standards in computer animated movies and deserves special place."

","It was May of 1991, and Disney were on the brink of the Animation Renaissance which would bring about a treasure-trove of beautifully drawn and designed 2D films. Only a few months later would the first and very elegant Beauty and The Beast be released. But behind the scenes, they negotiated a deal with a small animation studio named Pixar, previously only animating shorts to demonstrate the capabilities of their computers. John Lasseter would serve as director after being fired from Disney as he pitched the revolutionary idea of the first ever fully computer animated full length feature film. And so Toy Story was born. It was a long and complicated production process full of worries about budget, and the infamous Black Friday reveal which prompted a production shut-down and a full script revamp. It's sequel would later nearly undergo a disaster of similar scale. But after an arduous process Toy Story became a ground breaking film in animation history and set the first benchmark for 3D animation. <br/><br/>Toy Story is a beautifully rendered film for its time and eye poppingly gorgeous. Pixar's revolutionary animation process created a living breathing world with every tiny detail lovingly crafted - blades of grass, hairs on head, scuffs on floorboards. The character movement is smooth and seamless, the use of light and shadow realistic. Being Pixar's first ever feature film and under close scrutiny from Disney executives and given a small budget, short cuts like ponytails and short hair were used, and the textures of the background and minor characters are less visually impressive, but Tory Story still holds up remarkably well decades later. It's all wrapped in a stirring score by Randy Newman which easily accompanies the film's movement; lifting for Buzz's first take-off, eerily tip-toeing at the Spaceport Arcade. The main song You've Got a Friend in Me is heartfelt at the start of the film but even more-so at the end, Newman duetting with Lyle Lovett to symbolise the new partnership of Buzz and Woody. <br/><br/>The story is a simple but universal one, with an original twist. What happens when toys are alive, and furthermore, what happens when they are replaced by newer, cooler models? The titular characters of Buzz and Woody are stunningly brought to life through fantastic character design and voice-acting. Woody is your classic Western cowboy with a pull string that spouts recorded catchphrases while Buzz Lightyear is a futuristic Space Ranger who has pop-out wings and a laser. Who can compete with that? Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provide a great deal of emotion and character through their respective portrayals; in particular Woody's charm and leadership is a thin veneer for his insecurity and ego which is displayed when Andy gets a newer toy. Terry Gilliam singles out a great shot at the height of Buzz's personality as a Space Ranger, where he discover he is actually just a toy, and where the camera zooms out and the big bravado he was only a moment earlier is now a tiny figure. But apart from them you have a whole cast of iconic characters each with their quirks, personalities and traits; Mr Potato Head, Re the dinosaur, Slinky Dog, Hamm the piggy bank, Bo Peep, the plastic toy soldiers...We get the sense that these toys have been in the Andy household forever, and have formed a tight knit family and well-oiled hierarchy. the sequel 4 years later gives them additional screen-time which comes with more laughs (including the addition of Mr Potato Head's wife). <br/><br/>Toy Story set the first benchmark for computer animation and heralded a period of critical and box office success for Pixar. The 2 sequels are also crafted with as much detail and care as the first, but nothing can match the first gasps of wonder and amazement at the movement and freedom of the 3D world when it first hit cinemas in 1995."

","well what can i say about this outstanding masterpiece that hasn't already been said in other reviews. It was a thoroughly enjoyable film and i think it had all the qualities of a classic. There are some things that i think can be improved on and that's why this film can only get 9 from me Firstly i would like to question who really is the bad guy in this film? is it Sid a lonely boy who only has a faithful dog as a friend. Or is it Andy who as soon as he gets a new toy seems to disregard a toy that he had had for years and (spoiler) that turns out to be a collectible item in the next film and would pocket the family quite a lot of money. I think the latter is the true bad guy in this film.<br/><br/>I think this film is ground breaking in the way it tackles real life issues like buzz's tendency to dress up as Mrs Nesbitt. the film is very accepting of this and it shows Mrs Nesbitt having a tea party showing that whoever you are you can always get enough friends for a tea party.<br/><br/>It is hard to put this film into a certain genre but if i had to choose i would say it is a thriller. the way that as soon as the children are out the room the toys come to life is quite chilling. when Woodys head spins round when he is talking to the films hero Sid at the end is one of the films many intense moments.<br/><br/>This film is full of major plot twists like at the end where its Christmas and Andy gets a Mrs potato head. i just didn't see it coming. i was sat in my living room in utter silence when that Revelation came. I was almost speechless. i wasn't completely speechless but almost.<br/><br/>one of my favourite moments in the film is the horrific fight scene between woody and buzz. you just don't know whats gonna happen next. One thing missing from this fight scene was a corny catchphrase before punching each other like ""play with this?"" I think Pixar tell a story and have a meaning behind everything they do when Buzz flys at the end it just proves that you can do anything if you believe and after watching this film this is the way I'm going to live my life. I just want to make sure that every moment is lived to the fullest.<br/><br/>I was quite surprised that woody and buzz became friends in the end because both characters had said some hurtful things and I'm not sure if it is believable that they could both just get past this and call it all water under the bridge.<br/><br/>If you do get chance watch this film because it is based on real events and i think it gives people a good view of evidence on how to catch your toys out and make sure they don't go on any adventures while you are not looking.<br/><br/>To recap please go and watch this film. you really are missing out."

","Toy Story is an incredibly creative, fun film with a touching, heartfelt story. It is an awesome family film. The characters were brilliantly personified as they worked their way through their amazing adventures. The brilliant creativity of the characters and background layout is evident throughout the entire film; the background layout and lighting is fantastic. Each character has it's own vivid personality that was expressed with such unique individualism, additionally each character makes the viewer care for them. The story's continuity is definitely balanced with the awesome visual effects. The movie keeps the viewers' attention throughout it's entirety, with the twists, turns and suspenseful predicaments. The film also lends fun filled moments with many jokes/funny lines and expressions from the characters, while simultaneously allowing the viewers' hearts to reach out to the characters as they are tangled in many of the zany situations they encounter.

","Toy Story was the very first movie I actually sat down and watched as a child. I'm sure that there were many films I had passively experienced beforehand, but this picture was the first time I found myself engaged in the experience. It was the first one to actually catch my attention, as well as the first that I actually enjoyed. Nearly two decades later, it still holds up in my eyes. While I still occasionally watch other features from my childhood, none of them ever take me back like Toy Story manages to do every single time, and while my opinion of a lot of them changed over the years, Toy Story has always been ten stars, and one of the few I've grown to appreciate even more so as my tastes matured.<br/><br/>But this movie has managed to best the test of time so far in other ways too. Nearly two decades later and most of the movie still looks beautiful. The now dated animation techniques being used at a few points and the slightly ""shiny"" human character models are noticeable on occasion, but they're all forgivable thanks to the focus on the toys and interiors rather than the people and the outdoors. But even in scenes where those two are central, such as the ending sequence with Buzz and Woody following the moving truck, you find yourself paying no attention to them because you're so engrossed in what's going on in the tightly written narrative that you can't pick apart the trivial things.<br/><br/>All in all, Toy Story is a movie that's stood the test of time for me and an entire generation, and will likely find itself being watched for decades to come and, to quote Buzz Lightyear, ""To infinity, and beyond!"""

But as much as I enjoy the craft and history of Toy Story, I also think it deserves credit for its influence. It's just too bad that all the filmmakers that think they're working from the Toy Story template are missing the main ingredient: story. Pixar worked and reworked this script for years and refused to quit until they got it right.

"byson5186","9","0","1","15 November 2014"," Why The First Toy Story Is My Favorite
","So far they have come out with 3 Toy Story movies, and I also saw like a spooky Toy Story movie at RedBox and thought I heard that they are going to make a 4th one. It's interesting to think how this movie is from 1995 and was like the first fully computer animated movie, while nowadays almost all the animated movies we see are computer animated rather than the old days when they were digitally animated drawings. I miss those old cartoon movies. Anyway, Toy Story is definitely a classic movie. Kids today can watch the movie, and it probably won't seem like an old movie to them. They have made other Toy Story movies which seemed to earn more money than the first one. But, I will talk about why the first one is the best. The first one introduced us to the Toys in Toy Story, yeah they add some new toys in the later films, but this one is the first real introduction. It's always nice to remember the introduction of the characters we are familiar with in later films. Also, the later films seem to be more about adventures from the toys we know together in a group, in this movie it was mostly just the adventure of our favorite toys, Woody and Buzz. We see Woody's reaction to having Buzz as the new popular toy. Also, this one seems more about survival for Woody and Buzz, while in the other Toy Story movies it seems like it's less about survival and more about getting back to where they belong. Another reason to like this movie, from what I know while Pizza Planet is mentioned in other Pixar movies, this is the only one which shows them inside a Pizza Planet. I've always thought, that restaurant would be really cool to be at if it were a real restaurant. About Pizza Planet, I remember way back in 6th Grade in the scene when we see the Pizza Planet pick-up truck at the gas station and we hear the guys in it ask for directions to Pizza Planet, somebody in the classroom asked the teacher why would somebody who worked at Pizza Planet be asking for directions on how to get there? My teacher didn't know how to answer. In this movie we get to know Andy's original house and his neighborhood. We get to know the villain in this movie, Sid. The villains in the other movies are like the Chicken Man, Stinky Pete, and Lotso and some of his gang. I'm sure most of us could agree that our favorite bad guy in these Toy Story movies is Sid and let me give a few reasons to why we might like him the best. For one, Sid is Andy's next door neighbor. What's weird is the movie doesn't give any indication of whether Andy and Sid knew each other, so it can leave us with that question. Sid isn't like a bad guy, I mean he plays in the movie as a bad guy, but he seems to play a character we could imagine his age. I mean about a 13 year old boy who wears a T Shirt with a skeleton. He's aggressive and he likes torturing toys as a hobby of his, obviously not aware that the toys are alive. He likes explosives and stuff, and has a dark atmosphere in his room, along with mostly keeping his room locked. So, he's a G rated version of an early adolescent character who is supposed to be like the bad guy and he doesn't swear, talk about alcohol, drugs, or sex. He isn't like a criminal, just a scary kid with a dark atmosphere who likes to be the bad guy to toys he doesn't realize are alive. The climax in this movie also seems more exciting than the climax in the other movies. One thing we can find hard to believe, is how the toys have all these wacky adventures, doing things that somebody could easily notice, and nobody seems to be aware that the Toys are alive. Toy Story doesn't seem like The Velveteen Rabbit, but more like Toys who are having their own adventures, a little like The Lego Movie, where the Toys seem more alive than they seem like Toys. This is a great movie, I'd give a 9/10."
"smithclarkst","6","0","3","10 November 2014"," A Great Funny Movie
","I sat down to watch this movie again - and was totally blown away. It actually pretty scary for a child movie. Sid is one of the best villains I've ever seen and Woody's jealousy is really well done. The emotions and characters in the movie are complex and satisfying to watch. I can see the point of those people who complain about it being too scary for their kids - I'd say don't watch this with under five year old unless your child is a horror junkie.<br/><br/>My sister who is five still gets scared by the scenes in Sid's room. However, overall this is one of my favorite child movies and well worth a watch, it doesn't matter how old you are."

Don't understand the likes and dislikes but willing to accept all criticism. My own personal review may be liked or may be disliked. The clearness and accurate manner for beautiful taste in dual role models for example Sid the evil kid whom abuses toys and Andy the kid who doesn't like to play rough. However, Sid's sister is quite an opposite to Sid as well; she being a girl and has a love for tea parties with her closest doll Friends. The jokes and laughter in ""Toy Story"" is what made this turn of a century animated film a door-buster into the the first ""digital"" animated films in history. Of course, one does grow old and the story is great passed on to your children in just about any house hold!"

","Toy Story came out the year I was born, and it was my favorite film through a pretty significant portion of my childhood. I remember, even at a young age, being impressed by the animation (you might even say captivated), to the extent that I told people I wanted to be an animator when I grew up. What I didn't realize at the time was what a huge step forward Toy Story was in terms of using computer technology in films. The story follows Woody, a toy cowboy, who struggles with feelings of jealousy and inadequacy in the face of Andy's new toy, Buzz Lightyear. He makes a plan to get rid of Buzz, but ultimately, when his plan backfires, the two must work together to get back to Andy. The supporting characters add a lot to the film, and I've always considered the dinosaur (Rex) a favorite of mine. If you're looking for a lighthearted animated film to show your kids or just enjoy as a family, look no further. Toy Story offers an enjoyable experience from start to finish, and there's a lot to be learned from a character like Woody, who develops and grows throughout the film."

","I just watched Toy Story for only the 3rd time since it was first in the theaters, and as much as I liked a lot of the movie, it fizzles out over time for me. It's a very cute movie, mainly for kids, but it has a few chuckles thrown in for adults. The human characters in the movie didn't seem very realistic; their happy-go-lucky, suburban lifestyle just made them very flat and barely likable, especially if you grew up in a family unable to afford multiple toys. The voice actors were delightful, and their moods were directed very well, even for the plastic Army-men who don't show much emotion. The ""cannibal toys"" were very imaginative and creepy, so they served their purpose well. I thought the idea of the claw machine that housed the little green aliens was cute, how ""The Claw"" was their Messiah of sorts. The coloring in the film was vivid and incorporated some awesome day-glow tones that I had forgotten about over time. The ultimate reason to watch the movie is to witness Pixar's astounding use of 3D imagery, especially when they incorporate real-life effects onto the screen (i.e. The magnifying lens over Woody's face). <br/><br/>There were some aspects of the film I didn't care for. The movie is only 77 minutes long without the prefaced, short 3D movie before it, making the story suffer and seem a little lacking. I found the music to be over-the-top schmaltzy and generic, but it is primarily for kids and the Disney crowd, so I guess it belongs here. Again, the character of Andy isn't very likable, other than the fact that he owns a lot of older toys that we made have seen commercials of as a kid. The story wasn't very mind-blowing, but from the vantage point of a toy on the run, it is imaginative enough. It's the typical Indiana Jones setting where the main characters always find a way to turn their two-steps forward into one-step back. The ending with the falling through the sunroof was very convenient and could've easily been the start of another obstacle they needed to face, for example.<br/><br/>In the end, I like the movie for its presentation, but as a film, I was not blown away with originality or anything by its story. The messages that it sends about jealousy, envy, depression, fear, and questions about one's worthiness to another are the primary focuses throughout the movie, but it ends up just being another nicely tied-up package in the end, which is Disney for you. 5 stars."

","Toy Story (1995) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>A kid's toy room is split after his former favorite toy Woody (Tom Hanks) gets replaced with the newest sensation Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). The gunslinger Woody can't except the fact that he's no longer the kid's favorite so he and Buzz end up outside of the house and must try and find a way back. The Pixar form of animation has become the standard today so I'm sure many people watching these films forget how groundbreaking this movie was when it was first released. I was only fifteen at the time but giving it a second viewing after all these years just reminds me at why this thing became a hit. Not only is the animation beautiful and extremely life like but we also got a terrific screenplay that certainly brings these characters to life and really makes them something special. The idea of a film being centered on toys that come to life when no one is looking is something so simple yet so genius that you can't help but wonder why it took someone so long to do a film. The screenplay is without question one of the best ever written for an animation movie as all of the characters, from Woody and Buzz to Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney) are perfectly brought to life. The child-like nature of the story has so much energy that you can't help but smile at each journey that the toys find themselves on. The amount of imagination in the screenplay is what makes it so special because it really does seem like something a kid would come up with while playing alone in his room with the toys. Everyone can remember what it was like being a kid and playing with these toys and bringing them to life in our minds so to see that played out on the screen is certainly something special. The film has terrific laughs but also a nice message. The voice work is terrific with Hanks and Allen clearly leading the way but that Southern draw of Varney is special as well. TOY STORY was ground breaking when originally released and it comes as no shock that the film hasn't lost any of its impact. The screenplay with its great characters and story is guaranteed to be enjoyed for decades to come."

","I saw this movie was I was about 10 years old and I was captivated. This film was awesome. I watch it over and over again with my younger siblings and I enjoy it just as much as them. It's a great story and every time I watch it, it brings out the the kid in me.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks was amazing as Woody. Tom Hanks is one of my heroes and he never seizes to amaze me. He really brings Woody to life and he fits the role perfectly.<br/><br/>Toy Story has a really good, solid story line and amazing visuals, especially for 1995.<br/><br/>Toy Story 2 was almost as amazing as this movie, but nothing's as good as the original. I heard that they're making a Toy Story 3 set to be released in 2008. I'm hoping the theater is packed, with different generations, appreciating how Toy Story is not a only a stunning film, but also an example of the best kind of art there is. An absolutely awesome motion picture.<br/><br/>100/10"

","I am pleased, and amazed that films so cutting edge in their use of technology are so well written. Hollywood is notorious for taking the latest tricks and building entire movies around it, rather than using them to support a well written story.<br/><br/>Here, where it would have been so easy to rely on the WOW factor and slap together a meaningless story, Lasseter and company chose to focus on story and character, and leave the tech to the technicians, who also seem to have a better grasp on humanity than most movie techs.<br/><br/>These two movies (1 and 2) are part of a very short list of movies I've attended that actually got a standing ovation and applause at the end.<br/><br/>Bravo"
